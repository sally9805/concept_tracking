, but they were still close enough to the frontier for the effects of old fears and hatreds to manifest themselves . Wanting to share something with her , perhaps to replace the now vanished tie of blood kinship , he said : " I 've got German blood in me , too . My daddy told me that his people came from Germany , from up around the North Sea somewhere . They changed their name to Ringgold when they moved down into Georgia from Pennsylvania . Their real name sounded kind of like Ringgold in German , Rinegold or something . He told me there was a story behind the name , a legend sort of , about maidens guarding a treasure . " " Really , Johnny ? I know that story . It 's in a book I have that 's all full of beautiful pictures of warriors in armor and gods . Maybe they should have named you Siegfried , " she suggested brightly , looking him up and down as though measuring him for a suit of armor . " John 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckling a little .

" he replied , still trying to piece out the story from memory . " Would n't that make you a queen ? " " But I 'd still need the magic of Siegfried , " she said , looking down at him in a way that reminded him of Lucy McMaster the first time they met by the big pool . Maybe it was because it was the same kind of place , a still pond and a soft grassy bank that seemed to be part of an enclosed little world within the sheltering woods . And again the woman seemed to invite him with warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent . The frustrated hopeless yearning of a boy had been replaced by the hunger of a man to taste again what he had known . Still , in spite of the throbbing and the familiar delicious aching that worked its way down from his loins into his legs and began to turn his bones to jelly , he drew away from Margaret . " Guess we 'd better be getting back , " he said , starting to rise . But she held him still , grasping his sleeve with her delicate fingers and holding him down as firmly as Cole 's brawny arms had held him earlier . " They 'll be wondering , your daddy and brothers . . . " lw said weakly , uttering words without feeling , as though from a head unconnected to his body . And as she shut his mouth with hers , hutting her arms aroundp101his neck , the unuttered words remained in his mind : . . . trust me . They trust . . . The sense of betrayal did not leave him , and it grew as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss , which she had initiated , he was the initiator . He could tell that what he did with his mouth , what Lucy had taught him , was unfamiliar to her . But she learned quickly , responding with her own mouth . When he brushed her collarbone lightly with his lips and softly kissed the side of her neck , she tilted her head back , exposing the long golden curve of her throat . " Johnny . . . " she whispered . And as his palm touched her breast , moving lightly in a circular motion , she whispered his name again , almost sobbing it in a way that made him still more aware that he was the initiator , the betrayer . A spasm of guilt caused him to stop the movement of his hand , and he started to draw back from her , but then she clasped his hand tightly to her breast and covered his mouth with her lips . And now the sense of guilt and betrayal that had inhibited him began to fuel his overpowering desire . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and she was helping him , when they were both suddenly frozen by a terrifying sound . From somewhere across the pond , from a ridgetop close to a mile away but sounding much closer rolling across the water , came the sound of a rifle shot . She drew back from him then , and they looked at each other fearfully . " A hunter , " he said and glanced in the direction of the sound . " I do n't think he sees us . " " We 'd better go , " she said . He nodded and shut his eyes for an instant against the agony of frustrated desire . Then he stood up and gave her his hand . As he helped her refasten the buttons of her dress , he found the sight and touch of her golden back excruciating . When the last button was secured , she turned and clung to him , nestling her head against his chest . But when he tried to kiss her , she shook her head and pulled away . Wordlessly they walked back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration mingling with guilt and a terrible fear that he might have ruined a precious friendship . At the edge of the woods , he stopped her , blurting out : " Margaret , I 'm sorry . " She looked sideways at him then , and he wished that he could read her expression . She was regarding him with that same quizzical appraisingsmile she had when they met in Liberty . Her eyes were warm andp102sympathetic , but there was also curiosity in them . " Do n't be , Johnny , " she said , kissing him lightly on the lips . Remembering the boy 's feelings , the man Ringo smiles to himself . " It was a good thing , " he writes , " that her daddy had already planned to send her back that very week to the finishing school in St. Louis . He never lived to see us become lovers , and I seriously doubt that it would have been something he could have accepted . For some reason , the fact that she was about to leave did n't come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put to conceal my unhappiness . Whenever I looked at Margaret , I caught her watching me , but then she 'd look away , and I remembered what Lucy said about how poorly I hid my feelings . " The next day , as I was about to ride back to Liberty , she followed me out to the stable and watched from justloutside the stall as I saddled Blaze . He was , I recall , unusually accommodating as I smoothed out the saddle blanket on his back and got ready to heave on the saddle . " " I 'll write to you from St. Louis , " she said . John did n't answer right away , having most of his attention absorbed then by the big restive animal , who seldom accepted anything on his back without at least some token resistance . " Will you answer my letters ? " she asked , sounding a little anxious . Still absorbed in the business of getting the saddle right , he did not reply . When the cinch had been tightened , he finally answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , do n't bother if it 's going to be any trouble for you , " she said , sounding irritated and a little hurt . When he turned to her , he was amazed to see her dark eyes luminous with the beginnings of tears . He quickly let himself out of the stall and took her in his arms . " Course I 'll answer your letters , " he said soothingly . " Only I do n't suppose you 'll have much time to write me once all those fellows in St. Louis find out about you . " This prompted a scornful little laugh from Margaret . " Do n't worry about that , Johnny . This school is run by Catholic sisters who do whatever they can to make us girls live their way of life . About the end of last May I thought I was a sister . All I needed was a black habit and some beads . " He laughed at the thought of Margaret in such a costume and also with a degree of relief that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMaster in Vicksburg.  | " I 'll be back here for Christmas . You 'll be here then , wo n't you ? " " If your daddy invites me , " he said . " Of course he will , Johnny . You 're already like one of his sons . " It warmed him to hear her say this , but it also revived his sense of guilt and betrayal , so that when she raised her lips to him , he resisted the impulse to show her the passion he had shown the day before . He touched her lips as softly as he would have embracing one of his sisters . But Margaret was not his sister , nor would she accept the mild warmth of brotherly affection . Her ardent response to the touch of his lips instantly reawakened everything he had felt the day before . " That 's so you wo n't forget about me while I 'm off in St. Louis , " she said . " Not likely I 'll do that , " he whispered , holding her gently and brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wondered how it was that he could find himself involved again so soon with a woman who was forbidden and who dared not reveal what she felt for him . It had occurred to him that whatever Lucy McMaster felt for him was intensified , or even made possible , by the danger of discovery . Maybe it was the same with Margaret . Margaret 's departure for St. Louis did not make his visits to the Younger farm less frequent . Whenever his studies and the tutoring of Andy Hockensmith permitted , he would spend a few days with his cousins . There were more foot races and wrestling matches , as well as several hunting excursions . Cole had a passion for hunting , and John , who had learned to hunt on the prairie out of the necessity of supplementing what a small dirt farm produced , was happily initiated into the rite of hunting in the gamerichMissouri woods and fields . At first , he lacked the shotgun skills of his cousins , for it had not been possible at home to waste ammunition practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antelope , sage grouse , or rabbit  --  over ground that offered little cover had forced him to acquire more than one of the hunter 's arts . The abundant cover of these green woods enabled him to virtually disappear . Occasionally , when he and Cole would separate to drive deer toward each other , he would be unable to resist playing the prank of moving up to within arm 's reach of his cousin before the latter had even an inkling of his presence. " llammit , John ! " Cole shouted , whirling with his gun ready , the first time he was surprised in this way . " You move like a damn ghost . Sure you ai n't part catamount ? " " Could he , " he said , laughing at Coles amazed expression . " Where 1 come from , mere humans do n't survive .

I want to be walking through the woods to my secret place with you , my dear friend . These sisters wo n't even let me read Keats ' poems . Two of them came into my room and found my book open to where Porphyro and Madelaine escape from dwarfish Hildebrandand the others . Maybe that 's what they did n't like .

" John Ringgold cherished these letters , reread each one so many times that it was committed to memory , so that later , even after they fell into the hands of a Yankee interrogator who was trying to torture information out of him , he still had them in his heart . His own letters to her were , he thought , dull and uninteresting by comparison , but if he delayed in responding to her letters , she became bitterly reproachful : " You ca n't stop writing to me , Johnny . You just ca n't . I need your letters . I 'll go mad in this place if I do n't hear from you ! " At Christmastime she came home , and he was sustained during the ordeal of his examinations by the knowledge that he would be seeing her again . As soon as his last examination was finished , he set out for Independence , risking disaster on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an almost unrecognizable , mud-spattered condition , he arrived at the Younger farm two days before Christmas . " You 're here ! What took you so long ? I thought you were n't coining . I thought maybe you 'd decided to go back to ' texas , " she said in her delightfully exasperating way , hugging him in spite of his filthy condition.  | " I 'll never be a doctor if I do n't take a few examinations , " he tried to explain . " I know , Johnny , I know , " she said . " It 's just that . .. God I 've missed you ! " As he peeled off the mud in a steaming hot bath poured by one of the house servants , he savored the happiness of being with her again , if only for a few days . It was , he thought , just as well that it was too cold to be walking much outside , for they would have to be discreet . Just as well that the pond where they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over now . He would , he told himself , be satisfied with the sweet harmless pleasure of her company , surrounded by all the other Youngers . At supper that evening there was another visiting relative , a cousin of Mrs. Younger 's by the name of Jack Fenton , who had come down from Jackson County on his way to Osceola in St. Clair County . Over brandy and cigars , after the women had excused themselves , Fenton related news of some recent Jayhawker activity in Jackson County . He told them how Morgan Walker , a very wealthy farmer whom the Youngers knew , had managed to foil an attempt to jayhawk his slaves . " If ' t ware n't for that fella Quantrill , he 'd o ' lost more'n his niggers . They was fixin ' to take all his horses , too , an ' mules , an ' money , an ' then maybe kill him besides . " " Who is this Quantrill ? " Harry Younger wanted to know . " Well , as a matter o ' fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , " I met Mr. Quantrill at Thorndike 's general store in Blue Springs . Pleasant sort . You 'd never take him for a killer . He had a most interestin ' story to tell about why he led those niggerlovers into a trap . Seems he 's originally from Maryland an ' came to Kansas by way of Ohio with his older brother . They was goin ' out to California , but one night while they was camped along the Cottonwood River , a gang o ' Jayhawkers jumped ' em , killed the brother an ' left Quantrill wounded to die there . An Indin found him an ' took care o ' him . When he recovered , he swore he 'd hunt down every one o ' those jayhawkin ' devils . He said the three who went with him to jayhawk Walker 's niggers was part o ' the same gang . " " Funny they did n't recognize him , " Frank Marion remarked skeptically . " Guess it was too dark to see that night in Kansas , " Fenton replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in from Kansas with him , said they 'd find all the mounts they could steal at Walker 's farm . Then , while they was wuitin ' in the woods far it to get dark , Quantrill went in to scoutp106the place alone . He found Morgan 's boy Andy an ' told him all about what was goin ' to happen . When he come back later leadin ' the Jayhawkers , the Walkers was ready for ' em . Andy had rounded up some neighbours to help with the ambush . Quantrill stayed in the house to cover Morgan , he said . When the other three come out to help themselves to the niggers an ' horses , the neighbors was ready with their shotguns . John Tatum killed one of ' em on the spot . The other two ran through somethin ' like a wall o ' buckshot that wounded one of ' em . Next day a nigger belongin ' to George Rider come upon those two out in the woods an ' told Rider . Serves them damn abolitionistsright , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What happened then ? Where was this man Quantrill ? " Harry Younger wanted to know . " He was stayin ' with the Walkers . Morgan was so grateful for what he done , you know he give Quantrill fifty dollars , a saddle an ' a mighty fine black horse  --  pure Kentucky stock . " " What happened to the Jayhawkers ? " Cole prompted . " Oh , them , " Fenton replied , emptying his brandy glass and nodding to a black servant to refill it . " Well now , when that nigger told Rider , Rider told the Walkers . Quantrill went with the Walkers to where they was hidin ' in the woods . Morgan hisself got one of ' em with his shotgun when he went for his pistol , an ' Quantrill finished off the wounded one . " " Sounds like a damned sorry business , " Harry Younger remarked with disgust . " I do n't think I 'd trust this Quantrill . " " What do you mean , Daddy ? " Cole responded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real favor . That 's three less Jayhawkers we have to worry about . " " He had the trust of those men he led into that trap . Somehow he had their trust or they would n't have taken the risk of walking in there from Kansas . " " You 're too suspicious , big brother , " Frank Marion said , nodding at his glass for more brandy . " No , Frank , let 's just say that I know men , and I know what it takes to get them to do things . Those three abolitionists had to have reason to believe that Quantrill was one of them . " Fenton reentered the conversation . " Well now , colonel , I might as well tell you that some other folks thought the same way at the time . The county sheriff brought Quantrill into Independence for yuestionin ' an ' made no charges against him , but some o ' the folks there wanted to string him up anyway , just on account o ' his havin ' come in from Kansas with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel where he was stayin ' , an '  |p107Andy  Walker stood ' em off , said that if they lynched Quantrill it 'd be over his dead body . " John Ringgold listened with mixed feelings to this account of betrayaland bloodshed . On the one hand , he tried to see it the way Cole did , tried to feel some satisfaction over the demise of enemies from Kansas bent on theft and possibly murder . On the other hand , he was persuaded by the words of Harry Younger that the Jayhawkers were probably the victims of treachery . The Jayhawker troubles were all but forgotten in the ensuing days of festivity . There was another ball at the Youngers ' between Christmas and New Year 's and what seemed to be an endless stream of visitors , including some more cousins from up near Liberty , the Jameses . For the first time , John met Frank James , a soft-spoken young man about his own age who liked to talk about the Bible . He also met Frank 's kid brother , Jesse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John had even less time with Margaret than he had anticipated . He tried to conceal his disappointment , but she voiced it for both of them . " I wish we could get away from here for a little while , Johnny . I love my family , but I need to be alone with you . " They finally did manage to escape one afternoon when Margaret persuaded her family to let him drive her in a buggy over to a neighbor 's for a visit . There was snow on the ground and the streams were half iced over . Both of them were warmly dressed and they shared a Hudson 's Bay blanket across their knees , as well as a buffalo robe over their shoulders . In the sunlit thickets the frost-crystaled trees and bushes shone brilliantly , and occasionallythey could hear the piteous chirp of a bird enduring the cold . From time to time , John pointed out the tracks of deer and other animals as he noticed them in the snow , but otherwise they said little , and they had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Margaret asked him to stop the buggy . " Let 's walk a little , " she said . He helped her down into the snow and secured the team to a bare sapling . Then she watched as he rolled up the blanket and robe and slipped them over his arm . " Might want to sit someplace , " he said , hearing a nervousness in his voice . She smiled at him in an unusual , shy sort of way and said nothing . As he gave her his arm , she leaned against his shoulder . Walking in the snowp108was easier than in the muddy patches , for they both had fur-lined overshoes , his having been borrowed from Cole . Next to a brook that ran gurgling between banks of ice , he spread out the buffalo robe and the blanket . As he put his arms around her , she drew his head down and kissed him hungrily . Then , as they sank to their knees and he began to help her out of her coat , she said : " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " " Of course I will , " he murmured gently as he clumsily undid catches with fingers that seemed to have grown to the Mize of fence posts . " It 's the first time for me . " " Me too , " he lied . He regretted having to lie to her , but he was grateful to Lucy for the gentleness she had taught him . Gently , unhurriedly , he prepared Margaret to become one with him . Gently he entered , whereuponshe gasped a little and began to moan . Her moaning became a great sobbing cry that alarmed him at first when he saw tears streaming down her cheeks , but then her sobbing gave way to laughter , and he began to laugh with her , even until the moment when he died within her . Feeling the moment , she stroked his damp hair and kissed him . The flesh of both of them shone with sweat in spite of the temperature , and he carefully covered her nakedness and his own with the buffalo robe . Beneath them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow . They dared not remain there long for fear of pneumonia , but John wondered for a moment or two if he had the strength to get up . " I knew it would be you , Johnny , ever since that day by the pond , " she said . " But I never guessed it would be like this . And in the snow ! " She laughed . " It could 've been a driving rain and I would n't have known it . I do n't think I 'd have felt a drop . " " Let 's try it sometime , " he said , laughing . " In the rain , I mean . " That put the both of them into a giggling fit , not unlike the one they got into the night John was initiated into the Virginia reel . When her giggling subsided , Margaret nestled her head beneath his chin . He stroked the gleaming bronze head tenderly with his fingertips . In a minute or two they would be vulnerable to a chill , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Margaret spoke first . " Johnny , that was more wonderful than I can tell you . I was wondering if . . . " She seemed strangely embarrassed , would n't raise her head to look at him . " I mean , can you . . . ? " Understanding fully , he bent and softly kissed every feature of her beautiful face . Then he began to love her again , using devices Lucy hadp109taught him that he had n't used the first time for fear of repelling her . Once again she wept and laughed , and the threat of a chill vanished as they let the warm love in . What puzzled him a little that evening , though he did n't give it much thought , was the total absence of any feeling resembling guilt . Their lovemaking had a rightness about it that would n't permit guilt or even any worry that discovery would mean the end of his relationship with this family he had come to love as his own . It was a good thing , Ringo reflects , that Margaret was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though at the time he was wrenched by a terrible longing and fear that he would never see her again . " I 'll be home in May , Johnny . Be here , please , " she begged him as she was about to be driven by her father to the stage in Independence . He tried to assure her , feeling his own eyes well up in response to her tears . " Nothing 'll stop me . You know that . I 'll be here in May if I have to walk from Liberty . " When he returned to Liberty and she was once again in the care of her " jailers , " they maintained an even more frequent correspondence than before . Her letters were still entertaining , amusing accounts of her struggles with elocution , French , and black-habited tyranny , but now they contained utterancesthat could transport him with joy even as they filled him with a hopeless yearning to be with her . " You are the first man I 've ever had , Johnny , and I truly believe you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand times , and I 'll always be yours , my sweet darling . " Reading this in a letter he received near the end of March , he nearly climbed on Blaze and rode to St. Louis . Only a long , difficult inner struggle , during which he reminded himself that he was as yet nothing but a poor farm boy who had become a penniless student and who would n't , if he did n't master his chemistry , biology and the rest , ever be anything else , prevented him from riding to visit the woman he loved . " The only woman I ever really loved , " Ringo murmurs , still aching twenty-one years later . He consoled himself that time with a weekend visit to the Younger farm , where he was warmly welcomed as always . Within minutes of his arrival , however , he discovered that things were not as they had been , that the prosperous , peaceful world of the Youngers had been invaded. " : jayhawkers ! " Cole practically spat the word out . " Rode right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' long with one of our niggers. "  | " How many were there ? " " Six maybe . Daddy and Uncle Frank and Cyrus held ' em off till Richard and Jim heard the shooting and came in from the hemp field . I was over in Harrisonville , dammit ! " he said , shaking his head . " I thought we 'd be spared those devils , but I guess I was wrong . We 're just too close to Kansas . " That evening there was a dance int , Independence . Because the Jayhawkersmight still be in the neighborhood , Cole decided not to attend it , as he had planned . Two of his little sisters , Becky and Ida Mae , who had expected him to drive them there in the buggy , were very disappointed . " You go on ahead , Cole , " John urged him . " I 'll stand guard here with Jim and Richard . " Any opportunity to do something for the Youngers he jumped at eagerly . " Sure you would n't mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sure . Truth is I 'm not much for dancing . " " Maybe that 'll change when Margaret comes back , " Cole said with a grin that made his cousin wonder if maybe the Youngers were n't a little wiser than he had thought . After Cole and the girls drove off that evening , John took the shotgun Richard gave him and went to the stable to join Cyrus guarding the horses . The handsome mulatto was reading by lantern light with a shotgun across his knees , and he looked up as John Ringgold walked into the stables . " Evening , Cyrus . " " Evening , Mr. Ringgold , " he replied , regarding John with an enigmatichalf-smile that John had come to see was his habitual expression . Next to his left eye was some plaster over a bit of swelling . John remembered having overheard Cole and Richard talking about when Cyrus would be " ready again . " They had been speaking quietly , just out of earshot of their father , and apparently they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When John moved into the lantern light he saw that Cyrus was reading a Bible , and he remembered that literacy among slaves was rare . " How do you feel about Jayhawkers , Cyrus ? " he asked and was not certain why he asked . He guessed , knew from what he had seen of the mulatto 's proud manner , that Cyrus would n't bother to answer him in any sort of ingratiating darky way . " They 're enemies of my people , Mr. Ringgold . If they come back here , I 'll use this again , just like I did yesterday . " And he patted the breach of the shotgun across his knees.  | " But they 'd make you free , would n't they ? " " I 'm free , " Cyrus answered shortly and then repeated , " They 're enemies of my people . " " Who are your people ? " John could n't help asking . The mulatto did n't answer right away . His half-smile tightened and his long dark eyes narrowed a little as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Youngers are my people . " Driven by an overpowering curiosity , John was about to probe a little more , but at that moment a woman , a female slave , came into the stable . Her head was covered slave-fashion , but as her face was revealed in the lamplight , John found himself momentarily bereft of the power of speech . She was quite simply the most beautiful human creature he had ever seen . Her exquisitely sculptured face reminded him of a picture he 'd seen on a wall of the college library , the portrait bust of an ancient Egyptian queen , consort of the king who had tried to impose worship of the sun-god . Her narrow , delicate high-bridged nose and her sensitive mouth were queenly , as were the large , fine-lidded dark eyes that flashed defiantly , almost disdainfully at him in the lamplight . She must have been close to six feet tall , and she held herself as proudly erect as a queen , even though at the moment she was about the business of a servant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore Cyrus 's supper . She knelt beside him on the straw and uncovered it . As she handed him a steaming plate , Cyrus closed his Bible and set it aside , along with the shotgun . She regarded him intently as he began to eat , and he paused to look at her with an expression John had never seen on his face . The proud , almost derisive half-smile had softened , and there was unmistakable tenderness in the way he looked at her . He seemed to have utterly forgotten John 's presence , and the boy from Texas remained rooted where he stood , full of wonder and perhaps a little dazed by the spectacle of their beauty together . " Guess I 'll take a look around , " he heard himself say , as he moved in an almost trancelike state toward the stable door . Cyrus nodded wordlessly in reply but did not take his eyes from the woman 's face . The cool evening air quickly resharpened John 's senses , and he catfootedfrom point to point around the Younger farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . The slave cabins were set back along a creek nearly two hundred yards from the house . Between the house and the cabins was a fringe of hardwoods , the most likely cover for an attacking party , and John went through it carefully . At the edge of these woods , well removed from both the house and the slave cabins , was a house he had never noticedp112before . Half again as large as any of the slave buildings , it was , unlike the typical slave cabin , firmly set upon a stone foundation . The light inside shone through brightly colored window curtains , and there were chairs and a hammock on the covered porch . From inside he could hear the sound of an infant crying . The crying went on for a minute or two until suddenly he heard , from the direction of the stable , the sound of running feet . A dark figure ran up onto the porch and flung open the door , and just for an instant , in the frame of the lighted doorway , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's crying quickly subsided into a relieved and contented gurgling . Finishing his rounds , John stopped at the house , encountering Richard on the darkened porch . The barrels of Richard 's shotgun gleamed in the light of the rising moon . " See anything ? " " Not a thing . " Richard walked to the edge of the porch and spat over the railing . " I reckon they 're back in Kansas by now , damn their souls , devils ! " John said , " I did n't know Cyrus had a wife . " Ai n't she some ! " Richard responded with a low whistle . " Daddy bought her for him at an auction in Charleston two years ago when he and Uncle Frank went back home for a visit . You know , she 's straight from Africa , but she came from a different part , not from the west where they round up most of the darkies . Cyrus told us she 's the daughter of a chief of one of those lion-hunting tribes in the interior . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell .

But I do n't guess she 'd ever want to leave him anyhow . They sort of belong together , if you see what I mean . " " I surely do . They have a child , do n't they ? " " Yeah , " Richard answered shortly , and John sensed that his cousin had said all he wanted to say about Cyrus and his wife . The mulatto had called the Youngers his " people . " The nature of the connection John could only imagine . It was obviously something not discussed openly , even with a cousin.  |p113John  was about to excuse himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps in the darkness caused them both to whirl with shotguns ready . A huge dark running figure with coattails flapping and no hat came up the driveway and bounded onto the porch . " Who the hell . . . ? " Richard began , cocking the hammers of his shotgun . " Do n't shoot me , dammit ! " the runner gasped . John spoke up , recognizing the voice in spite of the exhausted gasping . " It 's Cole , is n't it ? " " Yeah , it 's me , " Cole answered . He flung open one of the huge double doors and let himself be revealed in the light of the entranceway . Having , not two hours before , seen Cole so neatly attired and groomed in a fine suit tailored to his big frame , driving his little sisters off in the Youngers ' best buggy , John was amazed at his condition . His cravat and collar had been discarded and his shirt was dark with sweat . There was a rip in one trouser leg and bloodstains around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been running through the woods , had n't dared show himself on the roads . They followed him into the hallway and were met by Harry Younger and his brother . The older men had been sitting in the parlor while the Colonel 's sons stood guard , but Harry Younger had his old pistol beside him , and now he emerged with it in one hand and a volume of Prescott 's Conquest of Mexico in the other . Frank Marion had a cup in his hand . " Cole ! My God , what happened ? " " I ca n't stay , Daddy . They 'll be here soon looking for me . " " Who will ? What 's going on ? What happened to your leg ? " " My leg 's fine . Just a scratch . I do n't have time to explain . Somebody'sgot to fetch Becky and Ida Mae . They 're still at Harper 's where the dance was . " " I 'll do that , " John volunteered . " Thanks , John , " Cole said , patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun cabinet standing near the entranceway and pulled open one of the drawers beneath the glass-doored rifle and shotgun racks . In it he found a cap-and-ball pistol , which he took out and began to load . " Cole , you 've got to tell me what this is about , " his father demanded . Cole looked at his father and nodded , accepting the necessity of an explanation . " There 's a militia officer . His name 's Walley . A captain , I think . He 's trying to kill Inc. "  | " Why , for the love of God ? " " I cut in on him at the dance . " " What the hell ! " Frank Marion exclaimed . " Since when did somebodytry to kill somebody over somethin ' like that ? " He raised his cup and drained it . " All I know , " Cole replied , " is he tried to shoot me , creased me right here . " And he pointed at the rip in his trouser leg . Cole went on to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had cut in on Walley , the captain had called him aside . " I 'll make no trouble in here , farmer boy , ' he said to me , but I 'll be waitin ' for you outside . ' Dick Harper overheard what he said to me , and he told me to watch out . He said Walley 's downright vicious and not afraid of blood . Sure enough , when I came out of the dance he and another man jumped me . I whipped ' em both , but then Walley pulled out his pistol and took a shot at me . I could n't get to the shotgun I had in the buggy , so I just took off running . I heard Walley yell to his friend , ' Go round up the men . We 'll run him down . ' So I stayed off the roads and got here fast as I could through the woods . " " Where are you going , Cole ? " his father wanted to know . " You do n't have to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir , it 's just better I disappear for a while . If I 'm gone , the militia will leave you alone . I 'll be back when things cool off a little . " " But where are you going ? " " Maybe it 's better you do n't know , Daddy . " " You 'd better tell me right now , " Harry Younger demanded , laying his hand on the pistol Cole was loading . Cole gave in . All right . You remember that man Quantrill ? The one who led those Jayhawkers into that trap at Morgan Walker 's ? " " Yes , I do . I said then that I would n't trust him . " " Well , from what I 've been hearing he may be all right . He and Andy Walker 've been leading a bunch of fellows who try to stop Jayhawkers from raiding Jackson County . They 've been doing some pretty good work , so I hear . " Harry Younger was amazed . " You 're going to join them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with having us be raided by Jayhawkers . If we do n't strike back , they 'll hit us again . " " So you 're going to be a Border Ruffian , is that it ? " his father asked , and there was disgust in his voice.  | " No , sir , that 's not it at all . If Quantrill 's anything like that , I wo n't ride with him . Please , sir , I 've got to leave now . " All right , Cole , " his father replied wearily . " You go on . Take Wellington . Chances are you 're going to be going over a few fences . We 'll take care of this man Walley , and we 'll try to get your mother not to worry . " Busheba Younger was then in Harrisonville caring for an ailing cousin . Awkwardly , self-consciously , Cole Younger embraced his father , and there were tears in his eyes as he shook hands with his brother , his uncle and his Texas cousin . " Take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole 's parting words as he rode the hunter Wellington out of the stable . John called after him that he surely would look after her and the rest of the family as well . And God knows I sho'ly tried , " Ringo murmurs , remembering . He writes : " We met Walley that night not twenty minutes after Cole rode out . I was saddling Blaze to go and fetch the girls when I heard the sound of a large party of horsemen arriving . I called to Cyrus and he grabbed his shotgun . He handed me a pistol which I did n't know how to fire , having never handled one before , and the two of us ran out and took cover behind a picket fence near the porch . My cousin Harry was standing unarmed out on the top step of the porch with the lighted doorway behind him . I hesitate to say it was a damn fool thing to do , making such a target of himself while he could hardly see the men he was facing . I guess maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle his quarrel with another man must be a coward who 'd back down if he was confronted . " Ringo remembers the confrontation as though it were happening at that moment . He and Cyrus were less than fifteen feet away from the mounted militiamen . " We 've come for Cole Younger , " a stocky , round-faced officer shouted at the tall , erect figure on the porch . " What do you want with him ? " Harry Younger replied coolly . " We 've come to arrest him for attacking two officers of the Fifth Missouri Federal Militia . " Are you one of those officers ? Are you Captain Walley ? " " Matter of fact , I am . Who are you ? " " Colonel I lenry Younger . I 'm Cole 's hither . He tells me you 're the ones who slid the attacking . "  | " Well now , ' colonel , ' " the stocky officer replied with a sneer , " if he told you that he 's a  --  " What prevented Walley from completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being cocked nearby in the darkness . One of them was next to John in the hands of Cyrus . Richard Younger spoke up from behind a tree not ten feet away . " You 're covered , captain . Best watch what you say about my brother . " The militiamen , eight of them , looked around nervously . Their pistols were holstered , and their carbines were still in their saddle scabbards . They 'd been expecting to run down an unarmed man , and the prospect of facing buckshot out of the darkness clearly had little appeal . " You 'd best get on back to your post , captain , " Harry Younger said . Walley glanced around him , saw that his men were waiting for orders and wondering how he would handle this delicate , dangerous situation . He tried to save face with a little bluster . " You have n't seen the last of us , ' colonel . ' Your boy 's going to be punished for what he did . " " We 'll see who 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I intend to report you to your commanding officer . " Walley did n't answer . He jerked his head at his men by way of ordering a retreat , and they wheeled about in the driveway . After they rode off into the night , Harry Younger 's sons and his brother left their cover to join him on the porch . Frank Marion spoke first . " That 's a bad man , big brother . You 're lucky he did n't have you blowed off this porch ' fore he knew we had him covered . " " He 's a coward , Frank . " " Do n't make no nevermind . It do n't take a brave cottonmouth to bite a man . " Harry Younger sighed and nodded his agreement . " You 're right . We 'd better get word to Cole to stay away until I 've had a chance to straighten things out with Walley 's superiors . " Later that evening , when he arrived in Independence to drive Becky and Ida Mae Younger home in the buggy , John Ringgold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of Captain Walley . " You tell Colonel Younger to watch out , " Dick Harper cautioned . " Walley 's a bad one , and Cole whipped hell out of hitn . " " How 'd it happen ? " " Well now , there ai n't no way we . an keep the Federal Militia out ofp117our dances , and most of ' em behave themselves , but I knew as soon as Walley came in that we were likely to have trouble . He 'd had a little whiskey and you could tell he 's one of those sawed-off runty kind of fellas that holds it against any fella that has a few inches on him . He asked Beth Tyree to dance . You know , she 's kind of sweet on Cole , but she said yes anyhow ' cause everybody was dancing with everybody else . Came the end of the dance , though , and Walley would n't let her go . Made her dance the next one with him and the one after that . She kept looking over at Cole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over and cut in . That 's when Walley threatenedhim . " " What happened then ? " " When I heard what Walley said to him I took Cole aside and told him he 'd better leave . He agreed and I let him out the back door . Then I brought out his sisters and helped them into the buggy . But Walley and another officer , a fellow as big as Cole , were hiding beside the house . When Cole started to climb into his buggy , the big one grabbed him from behind and held his arms while Walley started in hitting him and kicking him where it hurts . I was about to lend Cole a hand , but he took care of those two all by himself . Getting kicked that way must 've made him mad . He peeled the big one off his back and slammed his head into a porch post . Then he grabbed Walley and started slapping him like you would a kid who 'd smart-mouthed you . When he got through slappin ' Walley , he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he started to get into his buggy again , but Walley climbed out of the trough and ran over to his horse . He pulled a gun out of his saddlebag and took a shot at Cole . I guess you know the rest . " " Yeah , I 'm just wondering if Walley 's much of a threat to Cole 's family . " " I would n't be surprised , John . Ed Kincaid was just telling me about him . Said he 's one of the Federal officers folks suspected of helping out the Jayhawkers when they come through this county . It seems funny how those Kansas Jayhawkers know just which places to hit over here , where they 'll find the most to steal . Ed told me that Walley killed a man where he was stationed before down near Arkansas . He was cleared , but Ed heard that he 'd really done it . That 's why I tried to get Cole out of here . Yeah , if I was you , I 'd tell all the Youngers to watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to stay and help the Youngers watch out for their enemies , but his cousin would n't hear of it . " It 's your future , John . You still want to be a doctor , do n't you ? Youp118go back to William Jewell and study . We 're warned and we can look out for ourselves . " So he rode back to Liberty and poured his energies into his studies . Tutoring Andy Hockensmith was becoming an ever more loathsome chore , but he consoled himself with the thought that he could find other work once the school year was over . In the meantime he was sustained by Margaret 's letters . She told him how St. Louis was full of soldiers now , Germans in the home guard who did n't even speak English , and how everyone , even the sisters , was talking about the likelihood of war . He heard the same talk at William Jewell , where students and professors , mirroring the rest of Missouri'spopulation , were divided into Unionists , conditional Unionists , and pro-secessionists . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered from her letters that her family had decided not to tell her about that or the Jayhawker attack , probably for fear of her leaving St. Louis and coming home to help . On the morning of April 13 , John left the boardinghouse early , as he usually did , and walked to William Jewell to attend his first class , which was Latin . He noticed groups of people on various corners in what appeared to be animated conversation , but he did n't stop to ask anyone about the reason for the excitement . As he entered the classroom and took his place , Professor Grimestone was writing on the blackboard : Caesare duce , nihil timebimus . " Will you translate , please , Mr. Ringgold . " John studied the words a moment , then he said , " With Caesar the commander , we shall fear nothing . " " Very good , Mr. Ringgold . Perfectly correct . Though you could also say , ' Since Caesar is the commander ' or ' When Caesar is the commander ' or even ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This construction is called the ' ablative absolute , ' and it is used  --  " Professor Grimestone was interrupted at that moment by a student entering the classroom to hand him a note . The professor scowled at the interruption but thanked the student for the note . Then , as he read it , the little man paled visibly . The beads of sweat that always broke out on his hairless crown when he lectured became profuse , and he sat down behind his desk at the front of the classroom . " God help us , " he said , in a genuinely prayerful voice , and rested his bald head in his hands . Then , aroused by the murmuring of the students in front of him , he took up the note and read it to them : " Yesterday morning at four-thirty , Fort Sumter in Charleston harborp119was fired upon by batteries of the Confederacy . The bombardment is con-tinuing . " " It 's war , then , " a student next to John blurted out . The professor nodded sadly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help us . " " Was n't it Horace who said , Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori ' ? " piped up a blond , freckled youngster who had frequently let the class know that he was pro-secession . Professor Grimestone looked at the boy and shook his head before answering . " When Horace wrote that , Mr. Tyler , he was n't thinking about civil war . He was in a civil war himself , and he knew that there was nothing sweet or decorous about killing or dying at the hands of one 's own countrymen . " " The South 's my country , " the boy retorted . " I 'm ready to die for it . " Seeing the futility of any answer , the professor looked around at the room full of young faces , wondering perhaps how many of them would live to question Horace . It was , John was thinking , one of those moments for the professor to utter one of his favorite sententiae , but he did not . Instead , he simply rose to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Professor Grimestone 's colleagues reacted as he did to the news that the war had begun . Mr. McGillivray , John 's mathematics instructor , appeared the following week before his class in the uniform of a Confederate officer and demonstrated happily how some of the principles of geometry they had been learning could be applied on the battlefield , especially in the erection of defenses . John 's biology teacher , on the other hand , announced that he was joining the Missouri Federal Militia at the end of the term , and he urged his students to do likewise . John himself was completely undecided about what he would do if he was forced to choose sides . He would rather stay out of the war altogether , but if he had to choose , he would probably , influenced by Harry Younger 's arguments against secession and his own private feelings about slavery , join the Federal army . He wondered how the Younger brothers would choose , wondered if they would remain under their father 's influence now that the war had broken out . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walley . With these things on his mind and in his eagerness to see Margaret , who had already returned from St. Louis , it was all he could do to finish theterm . At the end of the first week in June , he wrote his examinations and with no small relief save Andy I lockensmith his last lesson.  | " So long , teacher , " the boy said , handing him a jug . " You done a right fine job with me . Hope you and me do n't wind up on different sides o ' this war . " " You 're a little young to be thinking about that , are n't you ? " John replied , declining the jug . " Not so young I ca n't kill me a few niggerlovin ' abolitionists , " the boy answered with a scornful laugh . John 's feeling that he would probably choose the Union side became considerably stronger then . He imagined Andy Hockensmith in a gray uniform , like that of his mathematics professor , charging across a field with others like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hapless Negro they were bent on lynching . When he had finished his last examination , he cleared out his few belongings from the wretched boardinghouse , discarding what he could n't fit into his saddlebags , and set out for Independence . He planned to spend a few days with the Youngers , then , with maybe a little help from his cousin Harry , find some summer work with one of the horse raisers in the area . But as he rode south toward Independence , he was repeatedly made aware that things were not as they had been , that a young man 's options might soon be affected by what had taken place in April in Charleston harbor . Near Independence , he passed a company of young fellows marching along the road behind a man in a blue uniform with gold sergeant 's stripes . Not long after that , he encountered another company , mounted , led by a bushybeardedman in a gray tunic with gilt insignia on the collar . The officer greeted him . " Hello , young fella . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing that the officer and most of the men with him were heavily armed . " You look like a true son of Missouri , " the officer began in the friendly fashion of one who wants something . " Fact is , I 'm from Texas , " John replied shortly , wondering why he bothered to volunteer the information . " Well , that 's even better , " the officer said , laughing expansively . " You 're already in the Confederacy . How ' bout joining up with us ? I 'm Colonel Hayes , up here from Arkansas to recruit men from Missouri for the Confederacy . " John thought quickly . He said , " I plan to join the army back in Texas . " The officer looked a little skeptical , but he replied , ' All right , young fella . See that you do that . This is no time for neutrality . ( kaki luck to you.  |p121After  that encounter , John was even more eager to reach his destination , mainly because Margaret was waiting but also because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he going to do ? That rebel officer might well be right in saying that this was no time for neutrality . But was he ready to join the Union army ? Harry Younger would help him to see the matter clearly , even as he helped Cole and his brothers straighten out their thinking . He did n't arrive at Harry Younger 's baronial farmhouse until well after dark , after a hard day 's ride . Approaching the house , he was overjoyed to see Margaret out on the porch . At first he imagined that she was anticipating his arrival , but he soon found out that other concerns were foremost on her mind . " Johnny . Oh my God , I 'm glad to see you ! " " Came just as soon as I could , " he said , hugging her tightly and then releasing her as her mother came out of the house . " You did n't see my husband on the road , did you , John ? " " No , ma'am , " he answered , sensing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama , I just know there 's nothing to worry about , " Margaret said , but she was n't very convincing . When they went into the house , the women told him how the Colonel , accompanied by his man Cyrus , had gone to see the Union commanderat Harrisonville . The Youngers ' troubles with Captain Walley had not ended with the departure of Cole , nor had their troubles with the Jayhawkers . Moreover , the two problems were apparently related . " Jayhawkers took Papa 's best team . You know , Johnny , those matched blacks ? " Margaret said , and he nodded that he remembered the team . " Well , right after they took them , " she went on excitedly , " Cyrus told Papa that he saw a militia officer driving the team down the main street of Harrisonville big as life . Cyrus knows our horses better than anybody , and he swore it was them . " Busheba Younger spoke up angrily . " It was that Captain Walley , the one who came after Cole . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " " Is Cole still with that fellow Quantrill ? " John asked . ' As far as we know , he is , " Margaret replied . ' As soon as the war started , a lot of the boys around here joined Quantrill . They 're going to fight for the South . " " I low does Colonel Younger feel about that ? " John wondered aloud . " Pupa 's real upset about it , about Cole being a guerrilla . He says itp122would be bad enough if Cole were in the rebel army , but being a guerrillawith that man Quantrill makes it worse . " " John , " said Mrs. Younger anxiously , " will you do us a favor and ride along the road to Harrisonville ? I 'm so worried I ca n't tell you . Harry said he 'd be back before supper . Now it 's close to ten o'clock . " John left immediately . The road to Harrisonville was illuminated by a full moon . He rode at a fast walk and after nearly an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Younger farm . Suddenly , as he started to round a sharp turn between a pair of giant oaks , Blaze shied away from something in the road . John felt a shiver run across his shoulder blades as he saw that what was lying in the road was a pair of human figures . Full of dread , guessing what he might find , he dismounted and stood over the two forms . Harry Younger was lying on his back in the middle of the road . His face was set in an expression of amazed outrage . In the middle of his white satin vest was a dark stain the size of a man 's hand . Beneath the vest could be seen the butt of the old service pistol still stuck in his waistband . Next to Harry Younger , the mulatto Cyrus was lying facedown . His powerful arms were stretched out before him and his huge hands were clenched into fists . Nearly the entire back of his shirt was covered with bloodstains . John felt himself choking with rage and horror . He sank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sob uncontrollably , weeping as he had not wept since the afternoon he found his father lying on the riverbank with a pistol in his hand . After an indeterminable number of minutes passed , he was able to hear something besides his own choked sobbing . He heard a voice whisperingto him from some bushes next to the road . " Mistah Ringgold . That you , Mistah Ringgold ? " " Who is it ? " he managed to reply . " It 's me , Jackie . " When Jackie emerged from the bushes , John recognized one of the Youngers ' slaves . Jackie was about eighteen , around John 's age , and the two of them had worked together during the corn harvest . Now he looked around him with wide frightened eyes , as though expecting to be attacked . Seeing nothing , he knelt beside John Ringgold and said : " I seen it all , Mistah Ringgold . I seen it all . " " What did you see , Jackie ? Who did this ? " he asked , responding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cap'n Walley . He the one shot Colonel Younger . " " How do you know it was him ? " " ' Cause dat 's what dem others , dem Jayhawkers called him . " Jackie told him how Colonel Younger , accompanied by Cyrus and himself , had driven a buggy into Harrisonville . There he sought out Colonel Tipton , Walley 's regimental commander , and demanded the return of his horses . Colonel Tipton then summoned the captain , who produced a bill of sale for the horses , which he allegedly acquired in Olathe , Kansas . Colonel Tipton had already reprimanded Walley for his conduct the night of the dance at Harper 's , but now , perhaps because it was known that Cole Younger was with Quantrill , he chose to back up his subordinate . Harry Younger responded by telling the two officers that he would be visiting the district commander in Kansas City , who happened to be an old comrade with whom he 'd fought in Mexico . " Colonel Younger was plenty mad when he come out from talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , an ' I hear ' cause I was sittin ' right behind ' em on de back end o ' de buggy . So we started out for home an ' we got just dis far when dat Walley an ' a bunch o ' other men on horses come outta de woods from both sides . " " How many were there ? " " Eight of ' em . Dey was six Jayhawkers an ' de cap'n an ' another soldier wid yella stripes here . " Jackie patted his own shoulder . " Dey all have guns out , an ' Walley say to de Colonel , ' 01 ' man , you ai n't goin ' to Kansas City . You ai n't goin ' nowhere . ' An ' den he shot him , just like dat . Den he say to Cyrus an ' me , Nigger boys , you 're free . Dese fellas gon na take you back to Kansas wid ' em . ' But Cyrus , soon as he see de Colonel dead , he come outta dat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his horse an ' started whuppin ' him t'death wid his fists . Dat when de other soldier wid de stripes shot him in de back , musta been four , five times . ' Bout den I got off de back o ' dat buggy an ' started runnin ' . Dey come aftuh me too , but I jump down a real steep bank where dere 's a little creek goes along ' tween big high rocks an ' you ca n't get no horse in dere . I hid in dem rocks till it was dark , den I come back here an ' wait for somebody to come along . Dere wah n't nothin ' I could do , Mistah Ringgold , " he concluded , and his voice was breaking . " You did just fine , Jackie , " he said , resting a hand on the Negro 's shoulder . " If they 'd killed you , we might never have known for sure who did it . " But now he knew , and he meant to act on what he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . With tears streaming down his cheeks , he reached out and closed the old man 's eyes . The funeral of Colonel Harry Younger was attended by grieving friends and relatives from every county in west Missouri . Jim Younger had managed to locate Cole with Quantrill 's band , and the two of them rode all night dodging Federal patrols and roadblocks to arrive just as the funeral procession was moving to the graveyard from a little country church Harry Younger had attended . The words of the Baptist preacher who conducted the service were in John 's mind as he walked behind Mrs. Younger and her daughters and the coffin borne by her sons . Having spoken of the high regard in which all who knew him held the Colonel and of his distinguished Mexican War record , the preacher said : " I 'd like to tell you , brothers and sisters , that everything we suffer is for the best , that every sorrow is a blessing , if only we could see it that way . But the fact is , some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Good Lord , in his infinite wisdom , permits the evil one to walk the earth amongst us and use evil men to carry out his fiendish work . Why this is so we may not understand until that day when we are raised up and permitted to see things clearly and no longer in a glass darkly . " As Busheba Younger and her children wept beside the open grave , John grieved with them , but in his heart , as there must have been in Cole 's and in the hearts of all of Harry Younger 's sons , was a raging passion for vengeance . He saw the agony of inconsolable sorrow in Margaret 's face , and he vowed silently that he would never rest while Walley lived . But as he looked around him at Cole and the other fellows with pistols stuck in their belts , he realized that he was as yet ill-equipped for the business of vengeance . He carried a shotgun in the funeral procession as a sign of his readiness to join in avenging the murder , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal officer surrounded by his men and his Jayhawker allies . There was only one way he could prepare himself , and as soon as the ceremony in the graveyard ended he went up to Cole and said quietly : " When you go back to join Quantrill , I 'm going with you . " Cole looked at him with reddened eyes , forced a little smile and nodded . Margaret was standing nearby with an arm about her mother . Somehowshe heard his words , and she left her mother to come over to him . " I heard , Johnny . I heard what you said . You must n't , you justp125must n't . Papa did n't want Cole going off with Quantrill , and he would n't want you to either . " " Do n't you want them to pay , Margaret ? Do n't you want the men who did this to pay ? " " Yes , I do . But more than anything I want you to live . Johnny , I 've lost too many people I 've loved . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have to go . " She did n't argue any more after that . Shutting her eyes tightly , she nodded , and he forced himself to turn away from her . But as he started to walk to where Cole was waiting for him , she called out his name and ran over to him . Indifferent to what her brothers and sisters might be thinking , she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him as a lover . " Please come back , Johnny . I wo n't live if anything happens to you . " " I 'll be back , " he promised , the touch of her lips almost diverting him momentarily from his thoughts of revenge . " Look for me in the fall . " As he and Cole walked back to the church , where their horses were tied , they passed near another graveyard , where Cyrus was being buried among the people of his race . All the Youngers ' slaves were there , along with others from neighboring farms , and John could see and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave with her arms raised to heaven and blood streaming down them from self-inflicted wounds , keening in the manner of the women of her tribe when a warrior-husband has fallen . It was a sound that moved John profoundly , and it would remain with him , along with the image of Margaret 's sorrowing countenance , for the rest of his life.  |p126On  the fifth day he rises early , as the first rays of the sun are striking the bare conical peak to the west of his camp . In a little while its warmth will bring the sweat out , but for now the air is chilly enough to make him shiver into an old gray jacket that looks as though it might be , like its owner , a muchpatchedsurvivor of the war . He gathers some dead branches of scrub oak and starts a fire , warming his hands over the flames before he goes to the spring to fill the coffee pot . For a moment or two , as he warms them , he studies his hands closely , as though looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible whiskey-begotten tremor . They are beautiful hands , or so he has been told , usually by a woman who has offered him her flesh to be stroked and is gratified and maybe a little surprised at his gentleness , and notices his hands , how slender and strangely delicate they are , how out of harmony with the rest of his big body . Delicate but strung enough for otherp127work , they might be the hands of a painter or a pianist or , he reflects wistfully , a surgeon . They are in fact the hands of a killer , delicate but strong enough to handle the instruments of death he has been carrying for over twenty years , the heavy pistols and the Bowie knife at his hip , the hideout knife on its lanyard suspended down his back . When did they become the hands of a killer ? During the war , surely , but when ? Was it during the Lawrence raid ? He remembers clearly his state of mind during that raid and realizes that his transformation had already taken place long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantrill thirsting for the blood of Red Legs was already Johnny Ringo . When , then ? Was it the night he discovered Harry Younger in the road where Walley had left him , staring up into the night sky ? The horror of that moment and the all-enveloping rage he felt had changed him surely , had filled him with a deadly resolution . But even then , for all his resolution , he had not become what he would become . He had not yet discovered within himself that readiness to confront another man and whateverthat other man might be bent on using to destroy him . He had n't yet discovered that strange , cruel , some would say inhuman , satisfaction that accompanies the fatal thrust or shot , in the moment when the enemy knows he has been killed and the murderous rage in his eyes is suddenly replaced by amazement , bewilderment and then , as he begins to grasp the incomprehensiblefact of death , terror . There was a time , he can still remember it clearly , when the very thought of inflicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough to sicken him . From the mother and sisters who stroked and spoiled him , from the other women who gave him their love , he had learned gentleness . And there was still a part of him that would always seek the loving tenderness of woman , valuing it above everything . But there was something else within him , caged there like some exotic man-eater from a distant land , which padded and pawed restlessly , yearning to be released . He tries to remember when exactly during the war this beast , his killing nature , was first caged inside him . Perhaps it had always been there , from the moment of his conception , an inheritance passed through the centuries from large-limbed , red-haired ancestors who had raided and raped their way clown into Europe from subarctic wastes . But even so , he might not have discovered its presence if it were not titr the war , and not knowing it was there would have been a kind of innocence . But the war had come to him , or rather , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Younger , filled with bloody visions of himselfp128returning to Margaret with Walley 's scalp , or maybe his whole head , to throw at her feet . He would prove his love for her , prove that he was her true knight . Full of rage and resolution , but still innocent , he rode from the graveyard with Cole to join Quantrill 's guerrillas . Quantrill had moved his camp twice since Cole left it to attend his father 's funeral , but they finally located it several miles up the Little Blue from Pleasant Hill in a clearing near Job Crabtree 's farmhouse . As they approached the clearing they were challenged by a sentry , who stepped out suddenly from behind a fat-bellied oak and confronted them . He was young , barely sixteen , with a pathetic growth of downy whiskers that did n't half cover the pustules on his cheeks , but the double-barreled shotgun he leveled on them had to be taken seriously . " Halt , damn you . Password ? " " Password ? " Cole repeated . " Hell , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , I know , but it do n't make me no nevermind . Nobody gets by me ' thout the password . I got orders . " " Now look  --  " Cole began , starting to heat up , but John cut him off , having suddenly recognized the sentry . " Andy ? " " Yeah ? Who . . . ? " He came forward a step and pushed back his floppy hat for a better look . " Well , goddamned if it ai n't my old teacher . What 're you doing here ? " " I 'm here to join Quantrill . How about letting us by ? " " Sorry , teacher , I got orders . Tell you what I 'll do , though . I 'll take you in there myself . Wait here . " He stepped off the path into a nearby thicket and reappeared in less than a minute mounted on a splendid bay horse . Then he motioned them to ride ahead of him . " Quite a fine animal you 're riding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , he was the best in my daddy 's stable . " " How is your father ? " John still had a warm spot for Mr. Hockensmith , who had given him a hopeless task in educating this young demon but had paid him generously anyway for the effort . ' All right , I s'pose . Last time I saw him he was where I left him . We had some differences about the war an ' about whether or not I ought to join Cap'n Quantrill . I did n't hit him real hard . "  |p129At  this Cole turned and looked sharply at the boy . You hit your father ? " he gasped in disbelief . " Had to . Just like I 'll have to blow you out of that saddle , Mr. Cole Younger , you do n't behave yourself an ' learn the password . " Glancing sideways , John could see that Cole was ready to bend Andy 's shotgun around his head , and he hoped that Cole could see what he saw , had seen even at times while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , that Andy Hockensmith was missing something , something that should have been inside his head or his heart or some other place it 's located in most people and prevents them from striking their fathers or blowing the lights out of someone else with a shotgun . " Easy , Cole , " he said softly . To Andy he said : " I 'll bet being a guerrilla cuts into your funning a little , Andy . " At that Andy Hockensmith guffawed in a way that reminded John of many an afternoon when he 'd wondered who was the teacher and who the pupil . " I still take what I want , teacher . Bein ' with Cap'n Quantrill you can take whatever this country has to offer , an ' like I used to tell you , a man 's a fool not to take what he can . " Emerging from the trees they entered the guerrilla encampment itself . There were about sixty men there , many of them hunkered down over little fires in front of lean-to shelters , cooking their evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal tents with U.S.A. stenciled on them . It was John 's first look at an " irregular " fighting unit . " Truth is , " Ringo recalls , " they looked a whole lot more like Curly Bill 's gang resting up after some serious rustling than a company of soldiers . As we rode through the camp , I could make out here and there the glint of brass buttons on military tunics . A few of them had served in the regular Confederate army before joining Quantrill , and they still wore proudly whatever they had left of their old uniforms . Others had appropriated the uniforms of dead or captured Federals which they proceeded to alter in various ways so they would n't be mistaken for Yanks . Somehow , if anything , these assorted bits of uniform made them look even less military than they would have looked without them . They wore them the way a bunch of wild Apaches or Cheyenne would wear what they 'd stripped off the bodies of dead troopers after an ambush . No two uniforms were alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a black plume or feather , usually stuck in the hatband , an ornament the color of the Hag they rode under.  |p130'At  the time I joined Quantrill I was wearing a gray jacket and trousers , which a kind lady down in Arkansas later transformed into my own eccentric version of a Confederate uniform by stitching red flannel stripes down the trouser legs and sewing onto the coat some brass buttons I 'd ripped off the tunic of a dead Yank . " " A pretty hairy-looking bunch , " he remarked to Cole as they approached the farmhouse . " They are that , " Cole replied , with a grim little chuckle , the closest thing to a laugh John had heard since the death of Harry Younger . " Some of them have sworn they wo n't either shave or cut their hair till they 've won the war . " They rode up to Job Crabtree 's farmhouse and dismounted just as two men in uniform came out onto the porch . These men , unlike those squatted around their supper fires in the clearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , they had in common that attention to military correctness that was so notably lacking in the others . At first glance , one of the men , wearing a dark blue tunic with gold bars on the shoulders , might have been taken for a Federal cavalry officer . But he was also wearing red-striped Confederate dragoon breeches , and there was a long black plume in his hatband . The other man was unmistakably a Confederate officer . His fine-quality gray wool tunic , adorned at cuffs and collars with swirling giltbraidedinsignia , was immaculately pressed and brushed , as were the matchingyellow-striped trousers . Around his waist was a gold-fringed yellow sash . The only thing missing was a saber . In its place was a belt with two Colt 's Navy revolvers . Andy Hockensmith addressed one of the officers . " Cap'n Quantrill , sir . I stopped these two and brung ' em in here . Happens as I know ' em both , but you said not to let nobody by ' thout they give the password . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , " you did just right . Now go on back to your post . " The boy " yessired " and departed with respectful alacrity , and John Ringo would remember how Quantrill , a former schoolteacher , always knew how to maintain , like any good schoolteacher , complete control over every big or little savage in his command , how to keep them all docile and respectful before him , no matter that a lot of them were , like Andy Hockensmith , missing something that generates respect in and toward most of humanity . The two officers came down the steps , and the one who 'd revealed himself to he Quantrill came over to Cole.  | " Mr. Younger , it 's good to see you back . I want you to know how very sorry I was to hear of your loss . The loss of a man like Colonel Younger is a real blow to the southern cause . " Quantrill had never met Harry Younger , surely , might not have been able to tell him from Abe Lincoln , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Younger 's outspoken views on secession , but it was **26;14886;TOOLONG , the sort of thing one ought to say to a grieving member of a prominent west Missouri family , and Cole was visibly moved . " Thank you , sir . This is my cousin John Ringgold , from Texas . He 's come to join us . " As they shook hands , Ringo guessed that Quantrill was close to thirty . " But I found out later , " Ringo writes , " that he was n't near that , was in fact about twenty-four . He seemed to be quite a bit shorter than either Cole or me , but that was because he tended to slouch a little . Actually he stood about five-foot-eleven and must have weighed around one hundred and seventy . He had blond hair and dark skin , the kind of sallow flesh that sun and wind will tan deeply . His rather lean face was what I believe most would call handsome . It reminded me of a sketch I 'd seen in a Latin grammar of a bust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-bridged nose and the same thin-lipped mouth turned down at the corners in a way that suggested either cruelty or determination or a mixture of both . You 'll see Indian bucks with those same bird-of-prey facial lines and suspect that they 've made their mark with plenty of coups . What I remember especially , though , were his eyes . They had heavy lids that tended to droop in a sleepy sort of way , but when they focused on you , they became as hard and sharp as bits of blue-gray glass . He was smiling at me in a pleasant , quizzical sort of way , but I felt those eyes probing right into me like cold sharp blades . " " From Texas , eh ? " Quantrill asked . " Yes , sir , " John answered . " San Antonio . " Cole broke in . " Captain , he can outride any Comanche in Texas . Moves through the woods like a ghost . I 've hunted with him . " " Might have the makings of a scout , " Quantrill reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you shoot , Mr. Ringgold ? " " Oh , surely , sir , " he replied without hesitation , being reasonably competent with a shotgun and not realizing that Quantrill meant pistols . " 1 ) o you have a Colt 's ? " " No , sir . I 'm afraid I did n't bring a weapon with me . " His mother kept as loaded pistol , an old Paterson Colt 's , in a kitchen drawer , ready for raiding Comanchcs or any other unwelcome guests who might hap/pen by , but he had never fired it , never wanted to . " That 's all right , " Quantrill said in a warm reassuring tone that did n't quite go along with his coldly penetrating gaze . " We 'll see that you 're armed . Lieutenant Todd here will take care of you . " He nodded at the man in the dark tunic , who came over and offered his hand . " I 'm George Todd . Real pleased to meet you . " Todd 's handshake was more prolonged than Quantrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John was n't surprised to find out a little later that he 'd been a stonemason before the war . He was , like Quantrill , a good-looking blond fellow , but much more powerfully built , and looked to be not much older than John and Cole . The warm dark blue eyes with which he appraised John Ringgold seemed to radiate good humor and a capacity for funning . " Pleased to meet you , lieutenant , " John said , trying his best to return the warmth of that grip . " Call me George . " John liked Todd instinctively , responding to his apparent easygoing good nature , even as he recoiled a little from Quantrill 's apparent coldness . It was n't until much later , after he 'd lost most of his innocence and met such jovial killers as Arch Clement and " Bloody Bill " Anderson and had come to know George Todd himself , that he came to react just as instinctively to good-ol ' - boy grins with suspicion , wondering what capacities lay coiled or poised in an S shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's root cellar , which was one of the guerrillas ' many arsenals in the neighborhood . There Todd issued him a revolver and ammunition . As John took the weapon , he felt a little tightening of his insides , the same sensation he felt every time he pulled open the drawer in his mother 's kitchen and saw the old Paterson Colt 's . " You can start with this , John . It 's a Navy Colt 's , .36-caliber . Sorry I do n't have a six-shot for you , but we 'll be picking up some more pretty soon . You 'll want to have more than one . Some of the men carry five or six pieces . That 's too many . . . " Something about a pistol , and he guessed he knew what it was . It was remembering a hand clutching one on a riverbank and remembering what the pistol had done . How could he bring himself to carry one and learn to shoot it ? He did n't think he could . But then how could he ride with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . if you ask me , but I guess it gives ' em some firepower . " " This 'll do fine , " john said . It really was a beautiful piece , if a man had . in eye for such beauty . The bluing was hardly worn , even along thep133barrel . The trigger guard and part of the frame were of polished brass , which shone against the varnished black walnut grip and the blued steel . On the five-shot cylinder was engraved a naval battle , which gave this particular type of Colt 's its name . " Do you have a knife ? " Todd asked . " Oh , surely , " he answered , producing a three-inch jackknife from his pocket . Todd chuckled a little when he saw it . " I mean a knife , John . Like this . " He drew a Bowie knife out of a sheath stitched inside his boot . Tossing it lightly in the air and catching it deftly by the blade , he handed it over haft-first for John to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bowie knife . Plenty of them could be seen sheathed on the hips of men around San Antonio , where , after all , Bowie himself , with one in his hand , had been bayoneted in bed by Mexican soldiers . But John had never had any occasion to examine one closely . Now he hefted the famous killer and started to test the edge with his thumb . " Do n't , John . It 'll go right down to the bone , you even touch it lightly . " So he kept his fingers away from the blade , which was no less than ten inches in length and heavy enough to split kindling . Along the bottom edge , from the brass guard to the curving tip , it was sharpened , and from the tip almost three inches back along the concave upper edge . " Tryin ' to think who might have an extra one for you . " " Maybe I can do without , " he said , wondering if he would ever be able to handle such a weapon without losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these , if not a couple . The Yanks carry sabers . This is what we carry . Let me see now It turned out that a guerrilla by the name of Jim Lilly , a huge man with a beard and hair down to his waist , had one more Bowie knife than he thought he needed . It , along with other weapons , had been bequeathed him by the late Perry Hoy , a guerrilla who had managed to transmit a last will and testament out of Fort Leavenworth shortly before he was hanged there . ( In Hoy 's memory , Quantrill had executed a captured Federal lieutenant and two other prisoners and then led a raid into Kansas to kill ten more men . ) So now John Ringgold was armed . The fact that he knew nothing about pistols and would tense up inside every time he handled his new Navy Colt 's was a matter of concern . It became more so the day after he joined the guerrillas , when he saw what some of them could do with their pistols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole and some others werep134drawn by the sound of firing to a gulley behind the Crabtree barn . Seeing the others stroll over in a relaxed manner , they could figure that it was n't an attack and followed after . In the gulley they found two dozen men mostly squatted down watching a shooting performance . The performer was a man called Hi George , a medium-tall , stoop-shouldered fellow with a pistol in either hand . Some twenty-five yards in front of him another man was tossing bottles in the air . One after another the shooter exploded them in midair . Then one of the watchers called out : " Ten dollars says you cai n't hit three at oncet . " Holstering one of his pistols , Hi George drew a gold piece out of a trousers pocket and tossed it to one of the watchers . Then he reloaded and holstered both pistols as two men got up to assist with the bottle throwing . Since no one else got in on the betting , John inferred that hitting three in the air was not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , was the speed the marksman exhibited . Two of the bottles were still ascending when he shattered them , and the third had just reached the top of its arc before it became a shower of glass . There were a few low appreciative whistles and Hi George collected his gold piece with another to match it . Then , as he moved back to reload his pistols , another man stepped forward . Instantly , John knew that he 'd seen this man before , but it took him a while to remember where . The man was maybe half an inch over six feet in height , with wide sloping shoulders and a waist as slim as a girl 's . He had handsome angular features , clean-shaven except for a neat moustache , but what was most readily noticeable was the black eyepatch he wore . " Let 's see some shootin ' , 01 , " one of the men called . Hearing the man 's name , John remembered meeting him , even before Cole muttered , " That 's 01 Shepherd . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepherd performed the same feats with flying bottles that Hi George had managed . Watching him , John could believe that he was even faster than Hi George . Both men drew and fired with a speed beyond the eye 's power to follow , but Shepherd gave a watcher the illusion that his guns never had been holstered in the first place , that he simply raised his hands and they sprouted iron . " He kin cut a quarter-inch rope at twenty paces , " Jim Lilly rumbled to Ned Vaughan , a newcomer like John Ringgold . " Hell he can , " Vaughan answered skeptically ,  | " Bet you ten he can , " someone else spoke up . Bets were quickly placed and Shepherd was informed . His only response was a thin dark stream of tobacco juice spat sideways . Then he drew out a twenty-dollar gold piece and tossed it to George Todd , who was holding the bets . While he reloaded , someone went to fetch a length of rope . The rope was attached to a tree branch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was expected to stand , moving with that deceptive slowness big , fast men will often affect when there 's no immediate need for quickness . The man who attached the rope informed him that it was moving a little in the evening breeze . " Do n't matter , " Shepherd replied , facing his target with an utterly relaxed stance . He spat another stream of tobacco juice and contemplated the target for several seconds . John watched his right hand , waited for the draw , knowing it would be just a blur of electrified flesh , like a snake striking . Even so , he was astonished when the shot came . Shepherd fired just as the barrel cleared his holster , and the rope was instantly severed . There were more low whistles of appreciation as the men came over to collect their winnings from Todd . John stood for a moment or two , mouth ajar like an idiot 's . Then as 01 Shepherd started back toward the camp , he followed him . Falling in beside the one-eyed gunman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me . . . " he began . " Do n't know as I do . . . " Shepherd replied . Then , having scrutinizedJohn Ringgold carefully with his single bright blue eye , he said , " Oh , yeah , now I do remember . At the Youngers ' . You 're their Texas cousin . " " That 's right , " he said . " I 've just joined up with Quantrill . I was wondering if I might ask you a favor . " " Well , surely , " Shepherd replied expansively . " Not much I would n't do for a cousin of the Youngers . " " Would you teach me how to shoot a revolver ? " At this 01 Shepherd laughed out loud , as though he 'd just heard something pretty funny . " You mean to tell me you 're from Texas and you do n't know how to shoot ? How come you ai n't been skelpt by some wild Indin yet ? " He laughed loudly again . Then , seeing that John did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped him on the shoulder . " Sure , I 'll be glad to he'p you . Meet me out here at noon tomorrow . " Shepherd was a good teacher , patient and encouraging , and John made rapid progress as a marksman . Within less than a week his nervousness about handling a pistol had totally dtsappearrd . The feel of the Colt 's in hisp136hand was completely natural , and he wondered how it had ever been otherwise . " You got real fast hands , John , real fast , " 01 told him . " But you got to slow down and learn to place your shots . Plenty of time to work on your speed later on . Do n't do you no good to get off a fast shot you do n't hit anything with . " He listened to Shepherd and learned to place his shots . It would be a good long while before he could cut a rope with a bullet , but after a week he was beginning to hit some of the tin plates and bottles Shepherd tossed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , however , far from being the shot he wanted to be when he had his first test under fire . It was a test he would remember well twenty-one years later . After a week we moved from Crabtree 's to another farm about six miles west of Pleasant Hill and made camp in a meadow . Cole and I did n't have a tent then , but it was still June and the nights were warm . Putting together a lean-to seemed like a lot of trouble , especially when it was so pleasant to lie out under the stars . But then one night the stars were covered over , and pretty soon we were being drenched by one of those prolonged Missouri summer evening showers . Cole and I wrapped up together in our blankets under a tree and tried to keep warm in spite of the puddle that spread out around us . I could n't have slept more than an hour or two that whole night . " " John , " he remembers Cole muttering , " I 'd mightily appreciate it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and womanly . " " Hell , " he muttered back , " you do n't start bathing yourself a little more often , I 'm liable to be the best you 'll get . " Cole replied with a chuckle , and in a few minutes his snores were adding to the misery of the night , one of many John would spend as a guerrilla , when it seemed that God was deliberately withholding the relief of dawn until the endurance of His wretched creatures had been tested to the limit and beyond . One can learn at such times the stoicism of the Indian , the ability to detach one 's mind from the sufferings of the poor dumb brute one calls a body . Or if one is young enough , still innocent , one can dream , imagine the sympathetic concern of a woman for whom one is willing to undergo such trials . Lying there in the rain huddled against her brother , who was n't really her brother , John dreamt of Margaret Younger  --  tawny , doeeyedGerman  --  Jewish  --  Indian maid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall those lines of poetry she had spoken that night out on the porch over the noise of the ball , those strangep137beautiful lines by that poet whose name he could n't remember at the moment , though Margaret had loaned him a volume of his poems , along with some others , to take back to Liberty . Keats ? Yes , Keats . Lines about an embalmed darkness and soft incense on the boughs . About being half in love with easeful death and not knowing whether he was awake or asleep . On such a night as this , they made a different kind of sense . But had he known what the next day would bring , he would not have yearned for this night to end . With the belated coming of dawn he rose wet and shivering , drew out his new Bowie knife and began to whittle some sticks and logs down to dry wood for a fire , while Cole spread their blankets out to dry in the morning sun . He was just about to touch off the shavings he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Federals three times in less than a month , Quantrill had finally learned the wisdom of posting a mile-wide ring of sentries even on a rainy night . Now the guerrilla chief scrambled out of his tent and sprinted  --  hatless , coatless , and half shaven , with a razor in one hand and a pistol in the other  --  past John and Cole across the meadow . The two young men grabbed their own pistols and ran after him , and by the time they reached the fringe of woods beyond the meadow , they 'd been joined by a dozen others , including George Todd , Bill Gregg and 01 Shepherd . Halting just inside the trees they beheld , less than half a mile away , a dark blue , fastmovingmass approaching along the muddy road from Pleasant Hill . Here and there within the mass one could make out the flash of sunlight on brightly polished metal . " About sixty , would n't you say , Bill ? " Quantrill addressed Gregg . " Yeah , I guess , cap'n , " the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy force or a situation , Quantrill was always way ahead of any of his men . " We can handle ' em , " he asserted with the brisk confidence of a leader encountering a familiar situation with men whose ability to carry out his orders he has no reason to doubt , when in fact , none of them , not even Quantrill himself , had yet faced anything like what was now coming toward them . Still , his mood of confidence was infectious , and no one questioned the orders he flung at them . " Bill , go back and get the rest of the men out here . Deploy them among these trees and tell them to stay out of sight . George , you round up the horses and drive them into that ravine over west of the clearing . The rest of you wait here . " Having stashed the razor in his pocket and wiped at the dried film ofp138shaving soap on one cheek , Quantrill checked his pistol . Then he crouched low and left the cover of the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersected the road . Reaching the fence he knelt behind it and beckoned for the others to follow . One after another , each man imitated his leader 's crouch as he crossed the open space to the fence , and John Ringgold was the last . By now the Federal column was less than three hundred yards away , and as John peeped through the weeds that rose to the top rail of the fence , he could make out drawn sabers flashing brightly in the morning sunlight . As a matter of fact , " he remembers , " there is no weapon quite so useless as a cavalry saber . During the war I saw more men killed and wounded than I care to remember , but not one did I see mortally wounded by a saber . On the other hand , a charging column of cavalry with drawn sabers can be a mighty impressive and threatening sight , especially when you 're not even eighteen and untested . " In fact , he was so scared that he wanted to scurry back into the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the first time he climbed on a bronc . His bowels were filling up with something that felt cold , and he began to wonder if he could control them . Must be , he thought , what a crouching rabbit feels like watching a hunter 's feet tramping toward him . " Steady , men , " Quantrill said in a low calm voice . " Do n't fire till I say . " John drew his pistol , checked the cylinder , and wondered if he would be able to use it . He had learned a great deal from 01 Shepherd , was able to break bottles on fence posts consistently and even sometimes in the air . But firing at a man ? As though he had heard the younger man 's thoughts , 01 rested a hand on his shoulder and whispered to him : " You 'll do fine , John . " John nodded and grinned weakly in reply . Quantrill did n't give the order to fire until the column had almost reached the gate across the road and was less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain slowed his column to a halt , ordering a sergeant to go ahead and open the gate , Quantrill rose to his feet . " Cut ' em down , men ! Blue-bellied sonsof bitches ! " he snarled , and his own first shot doubled the captain over in his saddle . John rose with the others , brought up his Colt 's just as Shepherd had taught him , but could n't bring himself to pull the trigger . On one side of him Cole began emptying his pistol rapidly without any apparent effect , sort of whimpering to himself as he did , " I 'll get one fir you , Daddy , get one , danunit , get one . . . . " ( hi the other side of him , Shepherd wits firing morep139deliberately and every shot seemed to connect , leaving men slumped over in their saddles if not unloaded in the road . Still , John Ringgold held his fire . Above the ear-splitting blasts of gunfire the guerrillas could hear the screams of wounded men and horses , the rending infernal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became almost undistinguishable from each other . Mingled with the screams were curses and the sounds of confusion . " Let 's get out of here , goddammit ! " " Where 's the captain ? Lieutenant ? " Apparently the guerrillas ' first volley had claimed the officers , for they could see that a sergeant was now taking command . " Fall back , men , fall back , " he bellowed. 01 Shepherd took careful aim and fired , whereupon the sergeant grasped his shoulder . Shepherd aimed and fired again , but the hammer fell harmlessly on a spent cartridge . " Shit ! " the one-eyed marksman hissed and spat tobacco juice onto the fence rail . " Thought I had ' em counted . " The Federals did n't hesitate to obey the sergeant 's order , all but a few who were sensible enough either to resheathe or get rid of their useless sabers and draw out their carbines . These men , apparently seasoned and not needing orders , took it upon themselves to cover the retreat of the others . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little tug at his shoulder and , looking down , saw a rip in his coat . He touched it , and his fingertips came away bloody . Still he did not fire his pistol . 01 Shepherd turned away to reload , and the man next to him , Ned Vaughan , suddenly dropped his weapon and clutched at his breast with both hands . For a moment or two he stayed on his feet , swaying , leaning forward against the fence rail , unwilling to go down in a fall from which he knew he 'd never rise . Then another Federal slug took him lower down , well below the midriff , and he pitched forward over the rail onto his face , rolled over onto his back in a slow , oddly graceful somersault and lay motionless , staring up at John Ringgold with wide , surprised eyes . Strangely , John was no longer frightened . A numbness and a feeling that the skirmish was n't really happening , was actually part of a feverish dream , had set in , and not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder or Ned Vaughan 's unseeing eyes could wholly convince him otherwise . He had yet to fire his pistol . Which turned out to be a good thing after all , for the guerrillas were suddenly threatened by something they could never have imagined . At first it did n't look like much of a threat . Just one lone cavalryman breaking away from the rest of the retreating column and charging directlyp140toward them at a full gallop across the field all by himself , yelling something they could n't make out at first and waving a saber over his head . As he drew nearer , the words " filthy fucking secesh bastards " came to them , shrieked out in the hysterical pitch of one on the verge of tears . The guerrillas who were n't in the process of reloading directed all of their fire at the man , but their shots either missed altogether or failed to connect vitally . On he came , bent low in the saddle , still whirling his saber and shrieking , " . . . Filthy secesh ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reloading his Colt 's . Incredibly , at that moment no one had a loaded gun . No one , that is , but John Ringgold . As though he were in a trance , John raised his pistol , bracing his right wrist with his left hand the way 01 had showed him for when he had time to aim . Now he could see the face of the horseman clearly  --  a young face , reddened with rage , bright blue mad eyes , straw-colored hair sticking out from under the blue cap . " Take him , Ringgold ! " he heard Quantrill bark again . Aim low , John , " 01 Shepherd cautioned . Now the young horseman was so close that John could see tears streaming from the bright mad eyes , and in that instant the memory of Margaret 's dark streaming eyes came to him . " Shoot , dammit ! " somebody was yelling . " For Chrissake . . . . John jerked the trigger instead of squeezing it the way 01 had showed him , so that the muzzle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the man higher in the chest than he 'd aimed . The young horseman screamed and sat upright , letting the reins go to clutch at his chest but still gripping his saber in the other hand . Just short of the fence the unreined horse turned abruptly , unloading his rider . The man landed on his back in the tall grass and rolled over twice . Then he lay still less than two yards from the feet of John Ringgold . " Christ ! " someone gasped . " Nice shooting , Ringgold , " Quantrill said and clapped him on the shoulder . " Come on , men . Fall back to the trees . " John heard the order but ignored it . He vaulted the fence and knelt down beside his victim . The man was still alive , still clutching his saber , which he tried in vain to raise . The bright streaming eyes shone with rage and hatred as they focused on his killer . How young he is , John thought , noticing the unrazored downy growth on his cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I am , surely . Why did the damned Federals let him join their army ? " " I 'm sorry , " he said to the boy . " I  --  " He could n't say any more because he did n't know what to say , and anyway the boy cut him off , gasping : " Damn your black soul to hell , reb . Damn you . . . " Then he began to cough , and bright red bubbles appeared on his lower lip . " Damn . . . " he whispered . His eyes left John 's face and became fixed on some point in the Missouri sky . The rage and hatred were still there , but the mad brightness was fading . John had never felt so wretched or so helpless in his life . The pistol was still in his hand , and he barely restrained an impulse to fling it away in the tall grass . Holstering it instead , he reached out to touch his victim 's hand that still gripped the saber . At his touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and his lips moved silently in what could only have been another curse . Then he began to cough again , and his eyes shut tight against the pain . When they opened again he was dead . " Hey , Ringgold , get back here ! " Quantrill was shouting from the woods . " Hurry , John , for Godsake ! " Cole shouted along with him . John heard the voices and rose up slowly , still in a trancelike state , as he had been when he raised his pistol , but now made almost unbearably dreary by a sense of having assumed an enormous burden that he would never shrug off as long as he lived . For a moment he stared down at the boy in the Federal uniform , still grasping his sword and staring up into the Missouri heavens . Then he turned toward the fence rail , reaching out to grasp it and vault over . As he did so , a large chip flew off the rail next to his hand and puffs of dust rose from the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of figures advancing toward him on foot . The ambushed cavalrymenhad dismounted and become a skirmish line . Some of them were pausing to drop down on one knee and shoot while the others moved on ahead . Then , when the kneeling skirmishers had reloaded , got up and moved ahead , the others dropped down to shoot . From the woods the guerrillas answered the skirmishers ' fire and continued calling out to their comrade , who seemed so strangely unaware that he was the skirmishers ' main target . " Ringgold , get hack here now , goddammit ! " " Run or you 're dead , John ! " Belatedly , he vaulted back over the fence and ran for the trees . Morep142dust puffs rose ahead of him and on either side , and as he reached the trees , a bullet probably intended for him caught a man named Donahue in the throat . Donahue went down on his knees grasping his throat as though he would strangle himself . John stopped to help him , and another man left his cover to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged him to cover , they could only watch helplessly while he coughed and gagged to death on his own blood . Quantrill ran over and knelt down to examine Donahue . Seeing that he could do nothing , he stood up and shouted at the boy from Texas : " Damn you , Ringgold , when I give you an order , you listen ! Hear ? " John looked at Quantrill but did n't answer . It occurred to him fleetingly that he would rather have the guerrilla chief 's blood on his hands than that of the nameless boy soldier he 'd just killed . " You all right , John ? " Cole was asking anxiously . " Yeah , I 'm all right , " he answered somewhat dreamily , as though Cole had just brought him out of his trance . Quantrill took a step toward him , was about to say or do something more , but he was stopped by 01 Shepherd , who laid a hand on his shoulder . " Best leave him alone , cap'n . I 'll talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the groan of a man nearby who 'd just caught a Federal bullet and a shower of bullet-cut twigs falling on his head reminded him that there were more urgent matters at hand than the disciplining of a man who 'd been tardy in obeying an order . The skirmishers halted their advance just out of pistol range . From there they maintained a steady fire into the woods with their carbines , and it was n't long before still another guerrilla was wounded . The guerrillas , armed only with pistols , were now at a disadvantage , but what convinced Quantrill to retreat from the woods was the sudden appearance of a sizable body of Federal reinforcements . Whether or not it had been planned that way , the skirmishers had succeeded in keeping them pinned down until a much larger column arrived . " How many you think they are , cap'n ? " Gregg was asking . " Hard to say , Bill . Two hundred anyway . We 'd best fall back . " There was no longer any excitement in his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the problem of meeting the Federal attackers , he was completely calm . Like the men who followed him , Quantrill was still learning . Never again would they make such a stand without reconnoitering an area to see just how large an enemy fierce they were encountering.  | " Follow Gregg " was the order passed through the woods . Quantrill ordered his lieutenant to lead most of the guerrillas back to the ravine where Todd had driven the horses , while he , with six picked men , remained behind to slow down the Federal pursuit . As he joined the retreat from the woods , John saw a man , a boy actually , limping after Gregg and the others and falling behind on account of the bullet in his leg . John knew him slightly , having talked with him one evening . His name was Zack Hayes , and he had just turned fifteen , a skinny awkward kid whose mother had brought him to join Quantrill six months before , after Jayhawkers raided their farm and forced her to set fire to her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged , " let me help you . " " Do n't need no he'p , " the youngster muttered , grimacing against the pain in his leg . " I 'll make it . " " You 've got to move faster . Here . . . " He wrapped one of Zack 's skinny arms around his neck and grasped the boy around the waist , half lifting , half dragging him along . " Let me go , John . They 'll get us both . " Which was likely , but John knew that there was no way he 'd leave Zack behind . The Federals would surely hang him just as fast as they would a grown man . John hardly knew him , had been drawn to him mainly because he did n't seem to belong in the guerrilla band . He 'd noticed the boy sitting alone at the edge of the camp with an open Bible in his lap , and they 'd talked a little about the passages he was reading from Second Samuel , about the wars of David . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the boy had asked him . " Who ? " he answered , though he knew perfectly well whom the boy meant , and the boy knew he knew . And he would have laughed out loud and said , " Oh , surely " or made some smart remark , but the boy was obviously sincere in his concern over the matter . If there was anyone more innocent than John himself in that camp , it was Zack . He had to be looked after . Suddenly the burden of Zack was lightened , and John looked over to see that Cole was helping him . " Let 's get movin ' , John , " he panted . " Those fellows ca n't hold ' em for long . " Between them they mostly carried the boy at a near run across the meadow to the mouth of the ravine . Inside the ravine ' Judd and five other men were holding the horses . Some of the animals were undisturbed by the sound of gunfire from across the meadow but others , including his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likelihood that they would be needed , Todd had ordered the horses saddled , but as soon as the skirmish began , Blaze and some of the others had become unmanageable . Someone had put a bridle on him , but no one could saddle him . Having helped Zack to prop himself against a sycamore trunk , John went to calm his horse and secure him to the same tree . " Where 's the captain ? " he heard Todd demanding of Gregg , who was still gasping for breath after his run . " Over in them woods , " Gregg answered between gasps . " Too goddamnedmany Fedruls . . . " He did n't have time to explain any more , for suddenly Quantrill himself appeared at the mouth of the ravine accompanied by 01 Shepherd and four other members of the rear guard . Later , 01 would tell John how they 'd killed two more cavalrymen but paid for it with one of their own . Remarkably , Quantrill was now attired in his full Confederate uniform , having pulled it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent gilt-braided tunic hung loosely from his shoulders , unbuttoned , and he had the yellow sash in his hand . " Deploy the men on both sides of this ravine , " he told his lieutenants , as he buttoned his tunic . " They 'll try to surround us . " Pausing for a moment to whip the sash around his waist , he added , " You might as well know they have enough men to do that . " Todd and Gregg nodded grimly , then ran to carry out his orders . The wounded who could n't fight were placed in the bottom of the ravine near the horses . Four men , including Cole and John , were ordered to guard the horses . For maybe a minute or two , it was quiet . The men scrambled up the sides of the ravine and positioned themselves , pistols ready . Quantrill sprinted the length of the ravine , stopping a couple of times to reposition some of them . As he passed the horses , one of the men called down to him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a little short of ammunition up here . " " I know , Ab , " the guerrilla chief answered calmly but a little wearily . " You 'll just have to make what you have count . Let ' em get close enough to hit . " Whereupon the shooting began again , and one of the first ones hit was the guerrilla called Ab . Shot through the forehead , he tumbled down the side of the ravine and came to rest near the horses . Quantrill ran over and knelt beside him . Then , shaking his head and cursing Co himself he rose andp145scrambled up to take the position Ab had vacated . Watching him , John wondered if Quantrill had any regrets about what he 'd led his men into . Maddened by the smell of blood and the firing , the horses fought to break loose from the tie rope that held them . A few of them succeeded , and before John or any of the other horse tenders could grab their reins , they had galloped off toward the entrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " let 's not lose any more ! " The loss of the horses meant the loss of their only apparent means of escape . Even with his inexperienced eye , John Ringgold could see that the guerrillas could not hold their position . An extended line of cavalrymen armed with Sharps carbines were advancing rapidly on foot , firing as they came . The guerrillas returned fire , but their ammunition was running out , and when Quantrill saw that the Federal line 's advance was not even slowed by their fire , he shouted an order that no one hesitated to follow : " Fall back and mount up , boys ! We 're getting out of here ! " Instantly everyone was scrambling down the sides of the ravine , but no sooner had most of the retreating guerrillas reached the bottom of the ravine than the blue-uniformed attackers appeared on the rim above them . Deploying themselves along the rim , they rained carbine fire on the men below . When a bullet plowed through the rump of one of the horses , it went mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the animal next to it pulled loose to follow , John grabbed its reins . A guerrilla who may or may not have been the animal 's owner ran over , snatched the reins from him and started to climb into the saddle , but a bullet from above caught him between the shoulder blades . As the man fell dead at his feet , John seized the animal 's reins again , pulled out his Colt 's and aimed it up at the rim . By now the dust raised by the horses and the wreaths of gunsmoke floating in the still , stovewarmair of the ravine were making it nearly impossible to see as far up as the rim . He could barely make out the dark figures crouched there firing down on them . No longer hesitant , he started shooting . His first shot may have connected , but his second went wild as the horse he was holding nearly jerked him off his feet . For several long minutes the only sounds in that smoky , dust-choked hole were blasts of carbine and pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then the guerrillas heard something rising above these sounds , something inhuman , like a strong wind coming up in the desert , or a rockslide starting in a mountain canyon , an inhuman sound of mindless destruction , made all the more terrifying by the fact that its source was human . It came , becoming a sound of mindless animal rage , from the darkp146crouching figures on the rim above who were suddenly no longer crouching but on their feet plunging down the side of the ravine . The guerrillas who still had loaded pistols picked their targets from among the charging figures , while those who did n't drew their knives . No orders were passed . None were needed . John fired at one of the dark figures rushing toward him , a figure that the smoke and dust made faceless , that threw up its hands and sprawled headlong ten feet in front of him . Then another dark figure leaped over the body of the first , a huge figure swinging a carbine like a club . John fired again but either missed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could maybe laugh at bullets . Then his Colt 's was empty , and the thing was upon him , casting its carbine club aside and dragging him to the ground . The enemy was a man , not a demon , but he must have outweighed John Ringgold by close to seventy pounds , a red-faced goliath with a neck as big around as a keg and small dark eyes that radiated more concentrated malevolence than anything John had seen since the last time he smashed the head of a Texas diamondback . Straddled by that enormous bulk , John could barely move . He tried to reach for his Bowie knife , but the big cavalryman caught his wrist in a grip that might have cracked the bones if he 'd put his mind to it . With his other hand the giant reached for and found a rock half the size of a bread loaf . " Gon na brain you , reb , " he snarled , raising the rock high above his own head . John 's free hand reached up automatically to catch the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no stopping the blow , and there was a part of him , maybe lodged somewhere inside the brain the giant was about to smash , that felt sorry for the body that was about to be killed this way , like some kind of snake or scorpion . Strangely , he felt very little fear , only a kind of weary regret during the split second he waited for the rock to descend on him . Still reaching in a vain attempt to block the huge rock-filled hand , he shut his eyes . But the rock never fell . Instead he felt a lessening of the enormous weight on him . Opening his eyes he saw a gray-sleeved arm encircling the thick neck , and there was a flash of bright metal as a hand appeared driving a blade into the giant 's chest . Bull-bellowing with rage and pain , the giant rose to his knees and reached back to grasp his attacker . In spite of the knife in his chest , he managed to throw the attacker over his head onto John Ringgold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest but tell sideways and sprawled on his back alongside his intended victim.  | " You all right , John ? " Cole was asking . " Fine , Cole , real fine . Alive , thanks to you . " Cole helped him to his feet and nodded toward their antagonist , who now lay still , his small dark eyes fixed and shining in that same attitude of concentrated malevolence . Ai n't he a big one ? " Cole said as he jerked his Bowie knife out of the man 's chest . " Tougher'n a damn hear , too , " he added with a nervous little laugh , thinking maybe of how there were damned few eighteen-year-old masters of the Bowie knife who could base such a remark on experience . He could n't hit a thing with a Colt 's , but that did n't mean he was n't a good man to have with you in a fight . All around them in the dim infernal smoke-wreathed light of the ravine , men were grappling hand to hand . Hardly any shots were heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used up most of their ammunition , and their wild spontaneous charge down the side of the ravine had come when they realized that their sabers and empty carbines were all they had to finish the guerrillas . Against the clubbed carbines and sabers the guerrillas wielded pistol butts , knives , broken-off tree branches , and rocks . Along with the heavy panting of the fighters could be heard inarticulate snarls and groans , not unlike what their troglodyte ancestors must have uttered encounteringeach other upon a disputed piece of hunting ground . They panted and snarled like wolves , and the madness of their rage was intensified by the terrible heat within the ravine . Above them the sun , like the great red eye of an all-devouring sky god , looked down through the smoky haze . John drew his Bowie knife and started to follow Cole toward where four guerrillas were trying to prevent six cavalrymen from getting to the few horses still attached to the tie rope . He felt a hand on his arm and swung about in a ready crouch , nearly slashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringgold , for Chrissake ! " He recognized the lank , bushy-bearded figure of Bill Gregg . " Sorry . . . . " " You got a horse , Ringgold ? " " I do n't know . " In fact , the haze was so thick that he could n't even see the tree where he 'd tied Blaze and left Zack Hayes . " Wal , find out . If you got one , meet me up t' other end o ' this gulley . Cap'n wants us to cut our way out . " Gregg ran on over to where Cole and the others were fighting to keep the remaining horses . John paused a moment to get his bearings , then he ran through the haze past shadowy dust-covered figures hiked in combat likep148fiends fighting for the privilege of tormenting the damned . Doubting that he would ever find Blaze where he left him , he was overjoyed to see the big stud still secured to the tree . His elation quickly disappeared as he made out the dark figure of a soldier with a carbine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , powerfully made fellow , had his legs braced apart and was about to drive the steel-plated butt of his carbine into Zack 's face . The boy had one skinny arm up to ward off the blow . " Do n't ! " he heard himself shouting as he ran toward the tree . The man did n't hear him , would n't have paid any attention if he had , being totally preoccupied with smashing the boy 's head as though it belonged to a venomous reptile or insect . But as the soldier drove the rifle butt downward , the boy twisted out of the way , avoiding the blow , and this gave John the seconds he needed to reach the man . Still intent upon smashing the reptile or bug thing between his feet , the soldier did not hear the running feet behind him , was raising his carbine again , and was amazed when a lean muscular arm went around his throat . Before he could even attempt to struggle , his whole chest cavity from the lower ribs on up was filled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sprawled on his face next to the boy he had tried to kill . " Good work , Ringgold ! You 'll make a soldier yet , providing you learn to follow orders . " John whirled toward the voice , bloody blade ready for more work , and found himself face-to-face with Quantrill and about two dozen guerrillas . Quantrill chuckled a little as he looked down and saw the blade not six inches from his midriff Wounded in the thigh , his immaculate uniform half covered with his own blood and that of his enemies , he was not intimidated by the wild-eyed young guerrilla from Texas who seemed so ready to disembowel him then and there . The boy himself had a fleeting desire to repay with a knife thrust the man who had led him into this bloody baptism , but he was restrained by a curious sense that the effort would have been futile . " I guess maybe I sensed that Quantrill could n't be killed then , not by me or any man . It might be that every one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federals , but he would n't be . I knew that somehow . He was as invulnerable as a holy martyr in boiling oil whose hour has n't come or a holy prophet being charioted off to heaven before his hour can come . Not that there was anything holy about Quantrill . I le was , at times , like this especially , more like a demon than a man . What he mightp149have had in common with the holy ones was a mission , a purpose he had to fulfill before he could be killed . Once that was done , then presumably all it would take would be some nameless enemy raising his weapon at a venture ' to smite him where it counted . Until then he was safe , and the fact that he took as many chances as he did that day tells me that he knew he could n't be killed . At that moment , standing there facing him with that knife in my hand and both of us looking as though we 'd been slaughtering hogs , I think maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I sensed I 'd be if I lived through that day . But I knew I could n't , and he knew it too . That 's why he smiled at me the way he did , looking right through me with those gun-metal eyes . " " That your horse , Ringgold ? " the demon was asking . " Yeah , he 's mine . " " Yes , sir , ' do n't you mean ? " Only Quantrill would have insisted on such a formality at such a moment . " Yes , sir , captain , " John answered wearily , all the rage and hatred of the moment before gone out of him . " Well , climb on him and catch up with Gregg up there at the other end . We 're surrounded . These boys and I are going to fight our way out on foot from this end . Get a move-on if you want to live . " " Yessir , " he mumbled and resheathed his bloody knife . Then he turned to help Zack Hayes onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Quantrill say , and as the men followed their demon chief into the smoky haze , John thought he was alone with Zack . The boy was very pale from losing blood and from the fright he 'd just experienced . John did n't know how he 'd get him onto Blaze 's unsaddled back . Then he heard the reassuring , familiar voice of 01 Shepherd : " Get yourself mounted , John . I 'll boost him up . " " Much obliged , 01 , " he said , wishing he could express the enormous gratitude he felt . But there was no time to think about that . As he looked about him through the haze , he saw groups of blue-uniformed figures everywhere and no guerrillas except for a few still figures stretched out here and there on the ground . Grabbing the reins and a handful of Blaze 's red mane , he swung himself onto the big stud 's back . Without a saddle , he might have been thrown , for all his experience as a bronc peeler , if the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few restive jumps Blaze settled down . 01 Shepherd helped Zack over to where John held the animal nervously prancing and lifted him like a child up behind the rider . " Hang on , boy , " he said , and the boy responded by wrapping hisp150skinny arms tightly around John 's waist . Obviously frightened nearly to death , he had n't said a word since John rescued him from the skull-crushing cavalryman . " Gregg ' n ' them 're up that way , " 01 said , pointing up the ravine , which was now so hazy that one could have easily become confused about which way to go . " Watch yourself , 01 . There 're Yanks all over here . " The one-eyed gunman laughed a little before replying : " Do n't worry , John . This chile ware n't born to be Yankee meat . You just get on out of here yourself . " And he gave Blaze 's rump a slap that echoed like a pistol shot . The big stud responded like a well-trained cow pony with a calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dirt , and as John guided him up the ravine , drumming his heels into the surging flanks , Blaze put on a show of speed that made the newly baptized guerrilla profoundly grateful to the man he was avenging , Harry Younger , whose gift he was . Ahead of him and on either side were blue figures with clubbed carbines and sabers ready . It was a deadly gauntlet , through which Gregg and the others had already passed , made ready for stragglers by their passage . John bent himself so low that his face was brushed by the flying mane , and the wounded boy clung tightly to his waist . As he passed through the first knot of Federals , most of them jumped to one side or the other , but one managed to connect his hard-swung carbine butt with John 's already wounded shoulder , and he nearly lost his knee grip on Blaze . Recovering just 'll as Blaze carried them into and through another bunch of soldiers , he saw a brief flash of metal as an officer hacked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , but later he discovered that his right trouser leg was soaked with blood from a long shallow flesh wound . Reaching the head of the ravine , he encountered the largest cluster of Federals , some of whom still had ammunition . Warned by the sounds of his flight , they were ready . John saw puffs of smoke in front of him , heard shots on either side and from behind as he passed through the gauntlet . He also thought that he heard Zack cry out but was unable to focus any of his attention away from the obstacles ahead , which included three soldiers who chose to stand their ground . At the last second , two of these men leaped aside , but the third went down cursing under Blaze 's hooves . Then they were clear . The big stud never slowed his gallop coming out of the ravine , and John headed him across a mile-wide meadow toward a hardwood forest in the opposite direction from Pleasant Hill , guessing thatp151was where most of the guerrillas had gone . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had scattered in every direction . Those on foot , led by Quantrill , were slowed by the wounded , none of whom were left behind , where they would have been easy prey for the pursuers . But the Federal cavalry were in no condition to pursue . Exhausted by the fight in the ravine under the stupefying sun and burdened with their own wounded , they rested and waited for fresh troops to finish what they 'd begun . " We made it , Zack , by God ! " John yelled as they flew across the meadow on the big tireless animal , who seemed to have sprouted wings . " Sure as hell we did ! " Never had he felt so exhilarated . He had been ready to die , had looked death in the face again and again that day , but now he was alive to fight again . All the weariness he 'd been feeling , running and fighting for his life under the pitiless sun after a night without sleep , was now gone . It was an excitement unlike anything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when every vital drop of his young manhood had been drawn out and spent , only to be restored miraculously by a shared passion . To come so close to death , even to go down into an underworld full of raging fiends , and yet to come out of it alive  --  was there anything like it ? As they were about to enter the hardwood forest , he looked back to see if they were being followed . Seeing no pursuers , he slowed Blaze to a walk . " Sure as hell we did ! " he said again to Zack . But Zack did n't answer . And suddenly the skinny arms that had been gripping his waist so tightly let go . Without uttering a word or any sound at all the boy fell off the horse into some tall grass next to the deer trail they were following . John slid off the horse and ran to where the boy was lying on his back , perfectly still and nearly invisible in the tall grass . He knelt beside Zack , whose eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life whatever . " Zack ? " Slowly the boy 's eyes opened . He looked up at John and started to smile , but the smile turned to a grimace of pain . His already pale face had become nearly as gray as the Confederate drummer boy 's jacket he wore . " I 'm mighty grateful , John , " he said in a voice that was n't much more than a whisper . " Is it your kg , Zack ? " he asked , ignoring the boy 's thanks . No , John , they got me again . Cumin ' through that last bunch that was sh ( Ktin ' at us. "  |p152It  was then that John noticed the dark stain beginning to spread along the boy 's side from underneath . " My God ! " he cried out , horrified and furious at the nameless marksman . He started to lift Zack by the shoulders for a better look . " Do n't , John , do n't move me , " the boy pleaded in a whisper . John released him then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands hang down at his sides . All of his weariness had suddenly returned . " God , Zack , I 'm sorry , " he said in a voice that nearly broke . " Ware n't your fault . You did real good to get us outta there . Saved my life , you did . " His whisper was now very faint . " You saved mine . That slug 'd be in my back if you had n't been behind me . And by God I 'm not going to let you die on me . I 'm going to find you a doctor , get you patched up and back to your mama . . . . " He caught himself babbling senselessly this way , knowing full well there was nothing he could do but watch the boy die , as he had watched that other boy die . It was so easy , so goddamned easy , he was thinking , for a man to kill another man . Only God could keep a man 's life inside him . He wished that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how , along with the Greek and Latin , and that Asa Mitchell 's frog eyes up to heaven did n't come to mind whenever he thought of praying . " Oh my God . . . " was as far as he could go , however , in the direction of a prayer . He saw the boy 's lips moving in an inaudible whisper and put his ear down close to hear . So faintly that he could n't be sure he was n't imagining them , the words came through : " We 're . . . in . . . His . . . hands . " " Course we are , Zack , " he said warmly , as though he really believed it . But Zack did n't hear him . John hesitated a moment before listening to the boy 's chest , knowing that he was already gone . Then he raised up onto his knees and began to weep , and in place of the prayers that would n't come there came curses : " Dammit ! Damn you . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whom or what he was cursing . Tears streamed down through the black grime of battle covering his face and dropped onto his filthy blood-stained jacket . Finally he rose to his feet and walked slowly over to where Blaze was cropping the lush summer grass in a clearing that was nearly white with daisy blossoms . Unaware of the nearness of death , unconscious of human suffering , as magnificently indifferent to human fear and agony as a god , thep153big stallion filled his belly , and his powerful haunches gleamed like burnishedcopper in the sun . John picked up the reins and grasped the thick red mane but paused a moment before mounting to look back to where the boy lay in the tall grass . Except for the places where his own boots had trampled down the grass , which might have been made by an animal , there was no sign of any living human presence.  |p154The  summer passed quickly after that bloody day of initiation , and by the time autumn began to arrive , tingeing the hardwoods with reds and yellows to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas , John Ringgold was a guerrilla of guerrillas . Under 01 Shepherd 's patient tutelage he acquired a mastery of the Colt 's exceeded only by that of 01 himself . Perhaps because of this , but not this alone , he also acquired a degree of respect from Quantrill . " I want you to know that I 've been following your progress , Ringgold , " the guerrilla chief said one day early in October . " You 're turning into a first-rate soldier , one we can count on . " " Thank you , sir , " he answered , though he actually took little pleasure in Quantrill 's praise . For reasons he could n't altogether pin down , he still disliked Quantrill and always would . 1 lc had to respect him as a leader . After the lesson of ' the battle in the ravine , Quantrill no longer put his command inp155jeopardy , and nearly all of the men who survived that fight , especially those on foot , credited his cool , courageous leadership with having saved their lives . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seen us through't . " ) But there was , in spite of his proven courage and competence as a leader , an element of falseness that manifested itself in various ways . For one thing , his splendid uniform , which he had gone all the way to Richmond to obtain , now mended and restored to its condition before the battle in the ravine , was revealed by one of the new recruits , who had just deserted from the regular Confederate army , to be that of a full colonel . Upon being told that his men were aware of this , Quantrill said that he had been given a battlefield promotion to colonel by General Hughes . Since General Hughes had just been killed during a recruiting mission through west Missouri , no one could argue . The general had also reportedly promoted George Todd to captain . " I have another mission for you , Ringgold , if you feel up to it . " John was now one of Quantrill 's scouts . He and John McCorkle were the guerrilla chief 's " eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing Quantrill information about troop concentrationsand movements . It was lonely , dangerous work , but John preferredit to remaining in the main guerrilla encampment , where he had to take orders not only from Quantrill , but from Todd , Bill Gregg and the other elected guerrilla officers . " Whatever needs to be done , sir , " he answered coolly . " Cole Younger tells me that you 're well acquainted with the areas around Independence and Harrisonville . " " That 's right , sir . " Though he gave no sign of any excitement , his heart was pounding . He had had no communication with Margaret since July , when Jim Younger , who was coming to join Quantrill , had brought a letter from her . " I 'd like you to scout that area for me . Find out which Federal units are operating there , how many men there are , what kinds of weapons they have , and the names of the commanding officers , if you can find them out . We 'll look for you on the upper Sniabar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantrill 's tent , John sought out Cole and Jim . " If you have any messages for your mama and sisters , I 'll be at your place in a few days . " Cole and Jim looked at each other , trying to think of what to tell him . The message would have to be oral , fir it would be dangerous to the women if any written communication from the brothers fell into the l'ederals ' hands . Some of the Federal units in Missouri , such as the Seventh Kansasp156Cavalry , or " Independent Mounted Kansas Jayhawkers , " and Jim Lane 's " Kansas Brigade , " would be quite capable of having the women set fire to their own house if there was an excuse . Lately it had happened more than once in west Missouri . " Tell them we 're both well , " was all that either brother could come up with finally . " Tell them Captain , I mean Colonel , Quantrill is taking good care of us , " Cole added . John then went to the lean-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rawboned Missourian , was stretched out digesting his midday meal . He propped himself up on an elbow and watched as his fellow scout gathered his saddle gear . " Goin ' for a little ride , John ? " " Yep , over around Harrisonville and Independence . Our leader wants to know how many blue uniforms there are . " " You 'd do well to wear one of them yourself : " Guerrillas frequently wore Yankee uniforms , and there were several available in the cellar of the farm by which they were then camped . " Do n't have my size , " John fabricated . The truth was he could n't bear to put on a Federal uniform , even to disguise himself . " Just as well , I guess , " McCorkle replied . " Not too many Yank soldiers got hair as long as your'n . You 'd look more suspicious wearin ' a uniform . " John 's hair , uncut since he became a guerrilla , now reached his shoulders . Unlike other guerrillas , however , he did shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wind of the Kansas prairies . " Guess I 'll just have to pass for a farmer , " he said to McCorkle . " I 'm bound to tell you , John , you do n't look much like a farmer , either , " McCorkle answered with a grim chuckle . " You 'd just best not fall into their hands if you can help it . " " I 'll surely try not to . " He had to admit that McCorkle was right . The faded buttonless red flannel shirt he wore had the sleeves hacked off at the shoulder to facilitate quiet movement through the brush . His gray trousers were not yet adorned with red stripes , but they were thrust into Federal cavalry boots he had appropriated when they plundered a supply wagon near Fort Leavenworth . He took the precaution of removing the black feather from his hat , but still he did n't look much like a farmer . " Harrisonville , huh ? " McCorkle said . " Last time I was over that way the Fedruls had patrols guardin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch myself at crossin:s if I was you . "  | " I 'll do that . See you in ten days . " Keeping McCorkle 's words of caution in his mind , he managed to restrain himself and Blaze as they entered the more familiar parts of Jackson County and approached Independence . The big sorrel seemed to know that they were headed for the Younger farm , or maybe it was John 's own eagerness communicating itself to the high-spirited animal that made it so hard to keep him reined in to a walk . John felt as though he were on a furlough , and he remembered hearing how men were deserting the Confederate army to go home and harvest crops , claiming that they were " on furlough . " If anybody questioned one of these deserters , the man would usually point to the pistol in his belt and say , " That 's my furlough . " The difference was , of course , that John 's furlough had been in effect authorized by his commanding officer . Moreover , it would n't begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , most of whom were ardently pro-secessionist , hoping and praying that Sterling Price 's army would follow up its August victory at Wilson 's Creek and lead Missouri into the Confederacy , he found out a great deal about recent Federal troop movements . In midSeptember , Jim Lane , United States senator and Republican political boss of Kansas , had led his " Kansas Brigade " into Missouri . Near West Line , John spoke to a farmer who had been burned out by these Kansans . " Jim Lane hisself was here , " he said . " I heard him tell his men , Everything disloyal , from a Durham cow to a Shanghai chicken , must be cleaned out ! ' Then they took everything I owned , piled it in my own wagon and set fire to my place . Hell , I was n't even secesh ! I am now , by God ! " Closer to Independence , he met another farmer and his family driving south in a wagon piled high with furniture . From them he learned that the Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under Jennison and Anthony , had been raiding Parkville , Missouri , in steamboats . " I knowed some of them fellas , " the farmer said . " They used to live by us . But they was Unionist , an ' we had to run ' em out . I reckon they went to Kansas . Now I guess they 're back here to get even with us . There 's some real wild abolitionists with that bunch . I seen 01 ' Brown 's son , John Jr. , leadin ' a company o ' them Jayhawkers . He 's even crazier'n his of man , looks like . " He gathered all the infOrmation he could from people who were willing to talk , and beyond this he scouted several Federal encampments , spending hours lying in the underbrush while insects preyed on his face and naked arms , counting men and noticing how they were armed . He was happyp158to note that few men , only officers in fact , possessed revolvers , while most cavalry troopers had only single-shot carbines , and the infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of troops in the area was being increased much , if at all , which would please Quantrill should he be planning a raid in the area . By chance , though , he encountered another guerrilla scout , one of Ben Parker 's men , who informed him that Jennison 's Jayhawkers , the Seventh Kansas , would soon be in the area assigned to protect Federal supply trains from guerrilla attacks . Five days had passed since he left Quantrill 's encampment on the Kansas border , and in five days he had to rejoin the band on the upper Sniabar . It would not be as long a furlough as he had hoped for , but he had carried out his mission faithfully and the few days that remained were his own . In his eagerness to see Margaret again , he nearly ran into a Federal patrol less than a mile from the Younger farm . Reluctantly , he decided to wait for nightfall before approaching the house , and he knew that he dared not approach it openly . Federal scouts would almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , he spent an afternoon hidden in the thick brush less than a mile from the Younger house . From time to time , women could be seen walking between the house and the chicken coop or the vegetable plot . He thought he recognized Margaret , but he could n't be sure . The only male figure he could see was the boy Bobby Younger . Richard Younger , as he was to find out shortly , had enlisted in the regular Confederate army , and Frank Marion Younger had been incapacitated by a stroke shortly after his brother 's assassination . As darkness fell , he cat-footed out of the brush and followed a fringe of woods to the slave cabins beside the creek . He noticed that all of the slave cabins appeared to be empty , and it was n't difficult to guess that the Jayhawkers had completed their work of liberation . This presented him with a problem , for he had planned to get one of the slaves to carry a message to the house . But then he remembered that there was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain with the Youngers . As he approached the cabin in which Cyrus once lived , he was delighted to see light shining through the brightly colored curtains in the windows . He ran and crouched beneath one of the open windows . As he rose up and looked into the house , he saw the woman sitting in a corner reading a book that appeared to be the same Bible he had seen Cyrus reading the night of Walley 's visit . Beside her was a cradle , which she rocked from time to tige . Just above the covers a tiny brown head could be discerned.  |p159Not  wanting to startle the woman but seeing no other way , he tapped the window glass above the opening . Then he stepped back and waited . Suddenly the light in the room went out . The woman had put out the lamp to get a better look at who was outside . In a few seconds , she was at the window . " Who are you ? What do you want ? " she demanded in that same unservile tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to reply , but his tongue froze as he found himself confronting the twin black barrels of a shotgun . Before replying , he raised his hands slowly . " I 'm John Ringgold , " he said . Then , for no reason he could understand , he went on to say , " One of the Youngers ' people . " Maybe it was because he remembered Cyrus saying , " The Youngers are my people . " " Did n't recognize you , Mr. Ringgold . With that hair an ' all , you look like a wil ' man . " She put her shotgun aside , let him into the cabin and listened as he asked her to bring Margaret to him from the house . A little reluctantly she agreed , but then she asked him to look after her child while she was gone . After she left , he sat by the cradle , afraid that his wild appearance would cause the child to scream , but it did not . The bright round black eyes regarded him inquisitively , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying perhaps to reach the long red hair that fell about his shoulders . He smiled shyly down at the child of Cyrus and gave it his finger to grasp . " Johnny . " The sound of her voice uttering his name was one of the things he had sought to preserve through the three long months he had ridden with Quantrill . Often drowned out by the crash of gunfire and the screams of dying men , it came back to him sometimes as he drowsed in the saddle on long dusty marches or lay out under the stars at night . Now he heard it again , heard Margaret 's voice , and as he rose from the chair beside the cradle , she rushed across the room and threw herself into his arms . " You 're back ! You 're back ! Do n't ever leave me again , please do n't ever leave me , " she pleaded as she clung to his neck , and he felt her tears on his naked chest . " I wo n't . I wo n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quantrill , Walley and the war could be damned for all he cared . He would see that this furlough never came to an end . For the next three days , perhaps the most blissful of John 's entire life , they spent most of their time at Margaret 's secret place , the pond where she kid taken him from the harvest dust a year ago . They also walked through thep160woods and along the ridgetops surrounding the pond , seeking out what Margaret called " elfin grots . " " I 'm your Belle Dame sans Merci , Johnny . I will have thee in thrall , " she murmured as she wound her golden limbs about him and kissed him hungrily . " Thou hast me already , milady , " he responded in the archaic love language they shared only with each other . " This is one knight at arms who 's all through with war . " " Do you mean it , Johnny ? Do you really mean it ? " He did . Two days with her had completely convinced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again , that he could not leave her . Quantrill and the Confederacy would have to win the war without him . He had already begun thinking about where they could go to escape the war . " Oregon , " he said . " That 's where we 'll go . They say it 's all green out there , just like Missouri , only things grow better . Crops come up all ready to harvest almost overnight . " " I 've heard California has a lot to offer , " she said . " Maybe we 'll go there , if it 's far enough from this damned war . " " What about your ambition , Johnny ? Do n't you want to be a doctor ? " He laughed a little bitterly as he answered her . " That just does n't seem to be in the cards for me . Right now , I 'm about as close to being a doctor as I was on the farm back in Texas . My future , if I 've got one , looks to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making things grow . " For some reason , he thought of the tiny brown baby in its cradle , being rocked by Cyrus 's widow . " If you 'll share it with me , I 'll be the happiest man on earth . " " Oh , Johnny , I will , " she said and went on to show her delight by loving him as no woman ever had or ever would . He marveled at how the mere touch of her , any part of her , could inflame him . He was so filled with the joy of loving her that he could n't imagine any other feeling in its place . How , he wondered , had these hands with which he stroked her naked flesh shed the blood of enemies in battle ? And so they planned their escape from the war . The evening of the third day , however , they met near the slave cabins , and John could see from her expression that something was terribly wrong . He had been away for part of the afternoon trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Youngers ' prime stock had been driven off , either by Jayhawkers or the Federal cavalry.  | " Soldiers , Johnny . There were Yankee soldiers here . They threatenedus . " " How many ? " " Lots . Close to a hundred anyway . And Bobby said there 's a bunch more camped between here and Pleasant Hill . " " What did they say to you ? " " Their leader did all the talking . He was a real mean-looking little man with a moustache and pointy chin whiskers that made him look like pictures you see of the devil . He called himself Colonel Jennison . " " What did he say to you ? " " He said that they were the Seventh Kansas Cavalry and they were ' here to string up reb guerrillas . ' Somebody 'd told him that all our menfolk were with Quantrill , and he told us we 'd better not try to help them . He told Mama that he 'd personally make her set fire to her own house if he had reason to suspect her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The last thing he said was , ' Playing war is played out . ' Johnny , I 've never heard anybody talk that way to a woman . And Mama , too . Can you imagine ? " From what he 'd heard of Jennison , he could readily imagine . He said , " I had a little trouble finding you a horse . Maybe I can liberate one from that Jayhawker cavalry outfit . God knows they 've helped themselves to enough of your stock . " " Johnny , " she replied , putting her hands on his chest and looking him directly in the eyes , " I 'm not going . " " What do you mean ? You said . . . " I know what I said , but I ca n't go now . Mama needs me . Poor Uncle Frank ca n't even walk . Bobby 's a child . He ca n't do the man 's work that needs to be done .

" His miserable disappointment would not lethim sympathize with her reasons for staying . " It was those Yankees , Johnny , especially that man Jennison . He frightened Mama to death . " She put her arms up around his neck and kissed him , trying to make him understand . " It 's my family , " she said . Finally he let himself understand . He put his arms around her andheld her to him very gently . " You 're right , " he said . " You would n't be able to live with yourself if you did n't look after your f ; unily . " " You go , Johnny , " she urged him . You go out to Oregon or Califor/nia or wherever . Send for me when the war 's over . I 'll come to you wherever you are . " She really meant it , he knew , and he hugged her as he said , " No , Margaret .

" " I ca n't . " " Just a day . " " I 've already stayed too long . They 're expecting me day after to-morrow . " She closed her eyes then and nodded , as she had the day of her father 's funeral . " Just be careful , Johnny . Please do n't let those Yankees get you , " she pleaded , shuddering a little , as though she intuited that they might . " Do n't worry about me , milady , " he said , forcing a laugh . Then he mimicked 01 Shepherd , trying to make her laugh : " This chile ware n't born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . Twenty-four hours later , John Ringgold found himself tightly bound to a fence post in front of a barn somewhere in western Jackson County . He was naked to the waist , and not twenty feet away , among the dancing flames of a fire made with the parts of a gate , a strip of iron from a wagon wheel was being heated bright red . A Federal sergeant and two troopers were hunkered around the blaze watching the iron 's progress . Across the fire from them a stocky Federal officer was examining the contents of John Ringgold 's shirt and coat . Finding a packet of Margaret 's letters , he pulled one out and studied the envelope by the light of the fire . " So your name 's Ringgold , is it ? " the officer said to him . " That 's what I told you , " John replied , feeling more wretched than at any moment in his life , whether because of the sight of the letters in the officer 's hands or what he anticipated with the hot iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard it before , though . When I was passing through Georgia . It goes with a nigger-lynching reb , I guess . " " What makes you think I 'm a reb ? I 'm just a farmer , " John insisted ,  |p163trying  to save himself with a skill he had never acquired and never would  --  lying . " Oh , you 're a reb , all right . If you was n't a reb , you wouldn't 've tried to swim that river ' stead o ' crossin ' the bridge we had guarded . It happens that a couple o ' my men used to be with Major Gower 's outfit . They figure they saw you with that bunch o ' rebs Gower trapped back in June . You 're with that devil Quantrill , ai n't you ? " John said nothing . ' An ' lookee here . Looks like you got a sweetheart by the name o ' Younger . Ai n't that somethin ' ! Would n't be surprised if she was related to Cole Younger . " At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cap'n Walley , sir . " " Yeah , what is it ? " " Sir , Lieutenant Wilson wants to know if you want him to take this reb back to Kansas City or if you mean to hang him here . " Walley paused for a moment and regarded the prisoner thoughtfully before he replied . " Tell the lieutenant to go on back to Kansas City . We 'll join him there as soon as we 've finished our . . . uh . . . interrogation of the prisoner . " " Yessir . " The trooper saluted and ran off toward the farmhouse , where the rest of the captain 's company was being served supper by the women of Morgan Walker 's household . " That iron about ready , sergeant ? " " Yessir , it 's just about right . " John Ringgold saw the sparks rising as the sergeant , who had on a pair of blacksmith 's gloves , turned the iron in the flames . " Bring it over , will you , " Walley said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approached the prisoner . " Now , Mr. Ringgold , I 'm going to give you the opportunity to avoid something painful . All you got to do is tell me what you know about Quantrill . " " Who 's Quantrill ? " he tried lamely . " I 'm no guerrilla . I 'm just a farmer . " " How 'd you know Quantrill was a guerrilla ? " Walley snapped , pouncing quickly and laughing with pleasure at his own quickness . When the prisoner did not answer , he shrugged and said , ' All right , farmer boy , have it your way . " Then he nodded to the sergeant . John felt the heat of the iron as it moved toward his bare flesh , and he resolved not to try out . But as it was laid across his midriff he found that hep164was powerless to control a scream that rose with all the strength of his lungs . And he was equally powerless to control his lower organs . When the iron was removed , having been applied for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony of his flesh reached its peak and then began to subside , he became aware of a wetness running down the backs of his legs and a stench that rose to mingle with the smell of burning flesh . " Phew ! " Walley snorted . " That 's damn disgusting , I 'd say . " John ground his teeth together and fought back tears . A yearning simply to be freed of his pain had all but replaced the rage and hatred he had been feeling toward Walley . " It ai n't like I 'm enjoying this , farmer boy . Just tell me about Quantrill an ' we 'll stop . " " Quantrill who ? " he gasped , knowing that if he did n't pass out soon , the burning iron would cause him to reveal everything he knew . Walley nodded to the sergeant , who now brandished the iron in John 's face , either to fill him with anticipation of more of the same burning agony or to indicate that his face was the next area to be burnt . Abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just a minute , sergeant . " Abruptly the captain 's tone of voice changed as he said , " Evening , Miss Walker . What can I do for you ? " John 's attention suddenly shifted from the still-glowing iron in the sergeant 's hands to the woman addressed . " Evening , captain , " she said . " I 've brought you your supper . " She was darkly attractive , with masses of soft brown hair framing her handsome features and tumbling loosely over her shoulders . A white , lace-fringed collar surmounted a long , snugly fitting black dress that revealed in the firelight a rather voluptuous figure . Walley looked uncomfortable as he tried to shift his role from that of torturing interrogator to gentleman . Smiling nervously , he said , " I 'm grateful , Miss Walker , but this ai n't hardly a place for a lady . We 've caught ourselves a dangerous rebel , one of Quantrill 's guerrillas , and we 're questioning him . " Having handed Walley his supper and a clay jug of whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner . " He does n't look that dangerous to me , captain . But I guess you never know with these dirty secesh traitors . " As she looked him directly in the eyes , John thought he saw something that did n't go with her harsh words , but he quickly dismissed this impression and sought to compose himself , accepting the utter hopelessness of his situation . The sergeant had gone back to the fire to reheat the iron . " What are you going to do with him ? " the woman was asking.  | " Wal , seem ' as how he do n't seem willin ' to tell us anything about his friend Quantrill , I guess we 'll have to hang him . " John knew that a rope was waiting no matter what he did or did not say . It was just a matter of how long he wanted to endure having his flesh branded and his bowels rendered out of control . But for a few seconds he gazed intently into the woman 's eyes , savoring for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liquid , like Margaret 's , and he was profoundlythankful that Margaret could n't see him now . He hoped that she would never find out what happened to him . " Tell you what , Miss Walker , " Walley was saying . " I just ca n't appreciate your good supper sittin ' here lookin ' at that dirty reb . If you do n't mind , me an ' the men 'll go on up to your house an ' eat . After supper we 'll finish our business with this secesh scum . " While Walley and the others returned to the house with Miss Walker , one man was left to guard the prisoner . It was a chilly fall evening and the trooper huddled closed to the fire , which made him drowsy , and after not many minutes passed he began to nod . Soon his head dropped onto his chest . Across the fire from him , the prisoner , who had been sweating profusely during his ordeal , was suffering from a chill . As an hour passed slowly , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain some warmth . In his miserable condition he half believed he was hallucinatingwhen he heard a woman 's voice whispering just behind him . " Be quiet . Do n't say a word . " As he started to turn his head for a look at her she said , " No , do n't move until I 've cut you free . " Still not quite believing his ears , John obeyed and felt the passage of steel across his wrists and finally the haft of a knife being shoved into his right hand . " There , now you 've got to help yourself . " " Who are you ? " he could n't help asking . " Be quiet , " she hissed . " I told you to be quiet . I 'm Andy Walker 's sister , Anna . Tell him when you see him that we 're all right , but the Federals are all over this place . He 'd best not try to visit us . " Andy Walker 's sister ! So that 's who she is . He remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with Morgan Walker 's ( laughter after he arranged the Jayhawker ambush . Until that moment John had no idea that the Federals had brought him to the Walker farm . He started to turn and whisper his thanks to Anna Walker , but before he uuld utter a word he heard her steps as she ran off into the darkness . Andp166now the guard , aroused perhaps by a mysterious warning dream , suddenly raised his head and stared across the fire at the prisoner . John kept his arms behind him , clasping the wrist of the hand that held the knife with his other hand , so that his arms would still appear bound . He said : " I 'd surely appreciate it if you 'd loosen my tie ropes a little . " " Not likely , guerrilla , " the man said with a short , sneering laugh . " Well , could you at least look and see if my hands are changing color ? Feels like gangrene setting in . " More curious than sympathetic , the guard stood up and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Ringgold to examine his bonds , the prisoner 's left hand shot out and grabbed the front of his tunic . He pulled the guard off balance and with his right hand drove the knife hilt deep into the man 's belly . As the man started to scream , he released the tunic and clapped his hand over his mouth . Then he drove the knife in again , and again , whereupon the man slumped quietly to the ground at his feet . " I should have picked up his carbine , " Ringo remembers . " It would have made things a whole lot easier for me a few minutes later . But by then I was so used to relying on pistols and knives that I did n't even think about using a carbine . I just stuck the knife in my belt and started to run for the barn where I 'd seen them take Blaze . " He was halfway across the open space between the fence and the barn when he heard a familiar , hated voice . " Hey , farmer boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John turned and saw Walley on horseback at the edge of the circle of light thrown by the fire . Even in the semidarkness , he could see that the stocky officer was laughing . Still laughing , Walley drew his saber from its metal scabbard . " Now I 'm gon na reap you , farmer boy , " he said . As Walley spurred his horse toward him , John Ringgold went into a crouch . When the rider was almost upon him , John threw himself to the ground and rolled out of the way , but he could feel the wind of the saber missing him by inches . Walley 's horse nearly carried him into the fence , turning at the last instant and almost spilling him . The rider recovered quickly , however , wheeled his mount about and began another pass at the half-naked figure attempting to dodge him . As Walley passed him a second time , coming so close with his saber that he scratched him on one arm , John threw himself down beside a haystack near the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough on the other side of the fence . He rolled into the hay , and his fingersp167encountered a long wooden handle . Desperate for a weapon , unable to use the knife in his belt against the horseman , he drew the handle out of the straw and found it to be a pitchfork . " Ol ' Walley 's gon na reap you , farmer boy , reap you like you was wheat , " the rider shouted , and his laughter became the kind of high-pitched giggle John had heard Quantrill emit during moments of high killing excitement . At the edge of the firelight , Walley wheeled about again and spurred his horse toward the vulnerable man , who was now down on his knees beside the haystack . Grasping the pommel of his saddle , he leaned out with his saber ready to decapitate the kneeling figure . But suddenly the man rose , and Walley saw the pitchfork tines shining in the firelight . He tried to raise himself upright in the saddle , but the whiskey he 'd been drinking with his supper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexes . Slashing wildly , trying to ward off the pitchfork , he was carried onto the tines by his running horse and dragged off the animal onto the ground like a speared fish . John was himself knocked to the ground by the impact of Walley 's charge , but he scrambled quickly onto his feet and stood over his enemy , who was now writhing with the tines through his midriff . Groaning and gurgling , Walley tried to pull the tines out of his body , and for a moment or two John Ringgold considered leaving him in this condition . But it occurred to him that Walley might somehow recover . His troopers might manage to get him into Kansas City for medical treatment . Considering this possibility and unmoved by any feeling other than a desire to increase the agony of Walley 's last moments , he picked up the handle and drew the tines out of the captain 's thick middle . As the steel was drawn out of his body , Walley cried out . Then he began to whimper , holding his wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poising the fork , demonically animated by the unspeakable joy of vengeance . Instead of finishing Walley at once , he drove the tines again into his belly . " That 's for Harry Younger , you bastard ! " he snarled . Walley cried out again , so loudly that the troopers up at the farmhouse must have heard him , whereupon John drew out the fork and drove it into his chest . And that 's for me ! " Walley 's eyes bulged like a frog 's as he looked up at his killer , and he grasped feebly at the tines with bloody fingers . Finally , after a prolonged shudder that went through his whole body , he lay still . With considerable effort , John Ringgold restrained himself fromp168plunging the fork again into his enemy 's body . Remembering Walley 's stubby fingers flipping through the packet of Margaret 's letters , he reached into the breast pocket of the dead officer 's tunic . The letters were there , but when he drew the packet out , he saw that it was covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to the fire and dropped the packet onto the coals . By now , the troopers up at the farmhouse could be heard shouting at each other , wondering what was going on down at the barn and where the captain was . Because of the generosity of Anna Walker and the other women of the household with their whiskey , the men were in no hurry to investigate the sounds , each man being willing to let his comrades attend to the matter , some assuming that Walley was again engaged in torturing the captured guerrilla . By the time one of them , the sergeant , wandered down toward the barn in search of his captain , John Ringgold had Blaze 's saddle on and was about to mount him . Seeing the sergeant approach , he pulled Walley 's pistol out of his waistband and checked the cylinder . Then he swung onto Blaze and walked him to the doorway of the barn . At the edge of the shadowy circle of firelight , the sergeant nearly stumbled over Walley 's body . Instantly sobered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him in alarm . Suddenly he became aware of a rider bearing down on him , and he heard the chilling , savage sound of a Missouri rebel yell . The sergeant raised his pistol toward the rider and squeezed off a wild shot , but his shot was quickly followed by the crash of another , and he was doubled over by the impact of a slug in his lower belly . Rolling on the ground in his agony , the sergeant was but dimly aware of the sound of hoofbeats fading into the night . The rider bent low over the stallion 's neck and let him maintain his own pace , but after nearly two miles , he slowed him to a walk and began to look about warily . He had been captured the previous evening by a night patrol , crossing the Blackwater River at a ford below the bridge guarded by Federal militia . The Federals were not altogether foolish , whatever else you wanted to say about them . The patrol had been watching the ford precisely in anticipation of the likes of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fervent vow that he would never be taken again , at least not alive . Moving slowly , warily , but never stopping , he reached the guerrilla encampment on the upper Sniabar in twelve hours . " There he was challenged by a sentry who turned out to be none other than Andy Walker.  | " Password ? " Abe Lincoln 's underwear . " " Ringgold ? John Ringgold , izzat you ? " " Yeah , Andy , it 's me . Thanks to your sister . " He dismounted , and Andy led him to Quantrill 's tent . As they walked toward the tent , he delivered Anna Walker 's message and told him how she 'd saved his life . Then Cole suddenly appeared , running out to throw a great bearlike arm around his shoulders , now covered by a Federal army blanket , and he told Cole how he had visited the Younger farm and how it , like the Walker place , was constantly visited and watched by the Federals . He told himself that if he had any energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how his father had been avenged . " It 's the women we got to worry about , " Andy Walker said . " You 're right there , " John replied . " If those bastards ca n't get us , they 're liable to take it out on our women . " " I ca n't believe that even Yankees would do that , " Cole said . John paused at the entrance to Quantrill 's tent to turn and look at Cole . " Believe it , " he said.  |p170As  the sun climbs toward its zenith above the Dragoons , the tall man rises from his place beside the spring and walks toward the meadow in front of his camp . The warmth of the late morning sun on his shoulders and the back of his neck is a pleasing sensation , not like the oppressive heat that will come with the afternoon . He stretches his arms above his head , then swings them about in a kind of swimming motion to loosen his cramped muscles . Pausing at the edge of the meadow , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . He shakes his head as he recognizes the huge prints of the grizzly that had visited his camp . Glancing across the meadow , he looks again for his horse and pack mule but is not surprised when they are not to be seen . Looking up , he sees an eagle crossing the cloudless blue heavens on its way to a craggy perch somewhere up on the unscalable shoulders of the tall conical peak at the west end of the little mountain valley.  | " If he feels like it , he might just wing himself on down to Sonora , " the man says aloud , smiling a little enviously to himself . " That 's where I 'd like to be , if not a lot further south , down in the Yucatan where the ruralesdo n't know me . " Turning back to the spring , he is not a little depressed by the awareness of how he must again wing his thoughts back twenty years into the infernos of bleeding Kansas and Missouri . Memory can , he reflects , be a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade for years of one 's ordinary existence , but if a man would have the pleasure of these moments , he must endure the revival of others . The sweet memory of the love he knew in the war is inextricably bound up with the almost unbearable recollection of how it ended . ' A history of that war , " he begins , " should rightly include a chapter on how it was fought in Missouri and Kansas . It should at least give us guerrillas  --  Quantrill 's men and those of Bloody Bill Anderson , Dick Yeager , Parker and the rest  --  credit for tying up thousands of Yankees who would otherwise have been available to fight the Confederate armies over in Virginia and Georgia . Throughout ' sixty-two and ' sixty-three especially , we kept the bluebellies busy . In ' sixty-two alone we raided into Kansas three times , hitting Aubrey , Olathe and Shawneetown . We also attacked the Federal garrison at Lamar , Missouri , and would have taken the place if those damned Confederate cavalry regulars under Colonel Lewis had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sixty-two  --  ' sixty-three , we served with Joe Shelby 's regiment of Missouri regulars down in Arkansas at the battles of Cane Hill , Fayetteville and Prairie Grove , where a Yank musket ball nearly finished me . At Fayetteville , we even saved Shelby himself from some Arkansas Mountain Federals who 'd captured him . Later on , all by ourselves , we whipped General Blunt and a hundred regulars at Baxter Springs and damn nearly captured the general in the process . " But I 'm terribly afraid that when our chapter is written , there wo n't be much in it about Prairie Grove or Fayetteville or Baxter Springs . We 'll be damned lucky if those actions are mentioned at all . The sand and spirit our boys showed and the mentions in dispatches to General Price will probably be forgotten . What wo n't be forgotten , I 'm afraid , will be our visit to Lawrence , Kansas , in August of ' sixty-three . " Shortly after our Lawrence raid , I read a newspaper account that called it ' the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leavenworth Daily Consermtive , which tended to exaggerate the evil of our actions generally , but in this cue they might have been right . I have n't heard of anythingp172comparable to the Lawrence raid being carried out by anyone , Union or Confederate . What I wish more folks were aware of , however , were some of the reasons why we did what we did . " General Thomas Ewing , Jr. , had something to do with it . He was the Union commander of the District of the Border at Kansas City . I had the pleasure of being part of the guerrilla welcoming party that , so to speak , greeted the general the day he took command . A bunch of us long-haired partisans under George Todd bushwhacked a 150-man detachment of the Ninth Kansas Cavalry just outside Westport and killed about twenty of them . They ran like rabbits , and we chased them damn near into Westport . I remember Will McGuire sticking a note into the mouth of a dead bluebelly officer . The note said , Remember the dying words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Leavenworth back in May by General Blunt as a way of showing Kansas that he was doing something about the guerrilla problem , and just before he died , Jim told the folks who were there to watch the show that some of them would suffer for his death . Anyway , getting back to General Ewing , he seems to have come to the conclusion that he would never get rid of us by purely military means . Because , for one thing , most of the folks living in west Missouri had relatives fighting with one guerrilla band or another . These folks kept us supplied with food , clothing and good Missouri horseflesh . What we needed in the way of guns and ammunition we could always appropriate from the Yankees themselves . When the Federals came after us , we faded into the woods and hills , and there was no catching us . Sometimes they were lucky , as when Jim Vaughn walked into that barbershop in Wyandotte and let himself get caught by a squad of bluebellies or when I got caught crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us . We did n't lose a single man in that Westport ambush . " General Ewing came up with the idea of shipping several hundred families of known guerrillas out of the state , down into Arkansas . I guess he figured that the guerrillas would follow their families , who would then no longer be able to provide supplies . So along about the middle of August , in accord with General Ewing 's orders , the Federals started arresting men and women suspected of helping us . They were taken to the provost marshal in Kansas City and told to get out of Missouri immediately with whatever livestock or property they might manage to take along with them . After our Lawrence raid , the general drastically extended his order , enforcing the removal of people who could n't establish their loyalty . I remember seeing the roads near Kansas City crowded with poor folks , old men and kids drivingp173milk cows and oxen , harmless gentle women with babies in their arms walking along barefoot and shivering or maybe bareback on some piece of crowbait horseflesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one regretted being partly responsible for the way they were suffering the general 's wrath . As for the worst atrocity of the war , ' as it 's come to be called , I came to regret my part in that too , but not for some time after the event . At the time , I was so full of rage and hatred for Ewing and the others responsible for murdering our women that I regretted nothing . " What Andy Walker and I and some others feared finally came to pass . Even before General Ewing came up with his plan to depopulate west Missouri of Confederate sympathizers , the Yankees had begun rounding up our women and putting them in jail . At the time Jim Vaughn was hung , his sisters were confined in Fort Leavenworth , and not long after that we got word that a number of our women had been imprisoned in Kansas City . We did n't know who they were at first , and so we sent our Negro spy John Noland in to find out . The Yankees never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man spying for Confederate guerrillas , and he was always able to get us all the information we needed . What we found out in Kansas City that time put us all in a state of frustrated rage , but it was as nothing to what came later . " " ' My God ! ' exclaimed John McCorkle . ' They 've got both my sister and sister-in-law ! ' " Wait 'll Anderson finds out about this , ' Todd said , shaking his head after Noland revealed that three of Bill Anderson 's sisters were among the prisoners . Anderson and his band had just ridden down from Clay County to join Quantrill for a raid into Kansas . When he gave out the names of two others , Susan Vandiver and Armenia Gilvey , Cole stood up swearing . They 're my cousins , ' he said . But he had n't heard the worst . Noland completed his recital of the prisoners ' names : " ' Becky Younger and her sister Margaret . ' " Cole and I both immediately went over to Noland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two names . " ' I 'm certain , ' he said , regarding us with wide sympathetic eyes . " It took us both a few minutes to collect ourselves and start thinking clearly about how we were going to free them . Noland told us that the women were confined on the second floor of a three-story brick building on Grand Avenue . It was a rotten old building that anybody could see was on the point of collapse . A Federal lieutenant we captured later told us how a Federal army surgeon went in to visit the prisoners and then went right to Generalp174Ewing to suggest that they be moved to a safer place . The sonofabitch paid him no mind . " I had n't seen Margaret since the early part of June , when she and Anna Walker rode up together into the Sniabar camp to visit George Todd and me . That was the first time I 'd seen her since my ' furlough . ' Again , it was a sweet , blissful time during which I tried my damnedest to convince her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't desert her family . We both thanked Anna Walker endlessly for saving my neck . Anna was then Todd 's lady , being no longer involved with Quantrill . I was pleased to tell Margaret how I had avenged her father but was a little disappointed when the news did n't give her more pleasure . ' I 'm just glad you 're safe , Johnny , ' was all she said when I told her about killing Walley . Then she begged me to be more careful and not let myself fall into the hands of the Yankees again . Anna told me that they were going to hang you . You must n't let them catch you again . ' " Now she was the one who was caught . How to free her and the others was all that Cole , McCorkle and I could think about . Finally , after everyone had had a chance to present his bright idea , I came up with my own plan , and I did n't give a damn if anyone else approved of it . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' You 're what ? ' McCorkle snapped angrily , being apparently at that point where nothing irritates so much as a dumb remedy or solution to a problem . " ' You heard me , ' I replied in kind , being at that point where nothing irritates so much as being questioned by someone who has no plan of his own to offer . " ' I seem to recall that you was captured by Missouri volunteers , Ringgold , ' McCorkle reminded me . ' I do n't guess you recollect that the garrison in Kansas City is made up of them same Missouri Fedruls , just waitin ' to string up secesh guerrillas . ' " ' I did n't take your advice before , John . Now I will . ' I then explained to my mystified fellow scout how I planned to fit myself out as a Federal officer in one of our captured uniforms . And I 'll produce an authorizationto remove our women from that house to Fort Leavenworth . ' " ' Where will you get that ? ' he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could authorize Jennison to cut Jim Lane 's throat and Jim would n't question it . Our colonel can make something like that read like it came from Abe Lincoln . ' " They were skeptical but seemed to become more hopeful when Quantrill himself agreed to forge the order.  | " It 's crazy as hell , Ringgold , ' Quantrill said , but then he chuckled grimly and added , Just crazy enough to work . It just happens that I have a good supply of official stationery for the District of the Border . I also have a dispatch which some of our men picked from a Federal rider containing a fine sample of General Ewing 's handwriting and his signature . While you make yourself a little more presentable as a Federal officer , I 'll get to work on the authorization . ' " Obediently , I went to work with a razor and gave Cole a scissors to snip off all the long red hair hanging down my back . Luckily , a Federal captain 's uniform fit , more or less , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch the bullet holes in the tunic . We also found a Federal sergeant 's uniform that fit Noland perfectly . Passing ourselves off as a white officer and his aide from one of the Kansas Negro regiments seemed to be a good plan . " We were n't ready to leave for Kansas City until after midnight , and it was well after daybreak before we reached the outskirts of the town . Noland was driving the wagon we had brought along to carry the women . I had wanted to bring horses , but Cole pointed out that prisoners were generally moved by wagon . As we drove through the town , we passed soldiers in nearly every street , and I had to remember to return the salutes they threw me . Aside from saluting , nobody bothered to look twice at us , and I had to quell the excitement I was starting to feel that my plan might really work after all . The forged authorization I carried in my breast pocket looked official enough to fool General Ewing himself . " There it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sergeant , ' I replied , grinning to reassure him that I meant no rebuke . Right then my gratitude to him knew no bounds for the risks he 'd taken gathering information and coming with me . Then I looked where he was pointing and shuddered . " I believe that I could actually see that dilapidated old structure swaying on its crumbling foundations , and it was n't hard to imagine its termite-riddled timbers and rotten brick tumbling into rubble . There was a sentry in front of the place , an infantryman with a grounded musket who saluted with his hand across his chest . I waved him a salute and we tramped inside the front door , which was open and through which we could see particles of plaster dust ( lancing in the air of the dark entranceway . My insides began to knot up with a sense of urgency . " ' What can I do for you , captain ! ' By the dim light of an oil lamp inp176what had once been a parlor , I made out the well-tallowed figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table bearing the lamp and some coffee cups . " ' I 'm here for the prisoners , sergeant , ' I said , thrusting the forged authorization at him . ' Orders from General Ewing . ' With the maddening slowness of the self-important who will not be hurried , the fat sergeant took the authorization and scrutinized it . " ' You 're with Colonel Jennison 's Seventh Kansas Cavalry , sir ? ' " ' Yes we are , sergeant , and we 're in a hurry . ' " ' Did n't know there was any coloreds in the Seventh , ' he said , regarding Noland suspiciously . " ' Well there are now , ' I snapped , wishing that Quantrill had assignedus to one of the colored regiments in his forgery , as I had asked him to . ' We 're the Independent Mounted Kansas Jayhawkers . Sergeant Noland was freed by us from his bondage in Missouri and he has joined us to assist in the freeing of his brethren from their chains . Now we 'd appreciate your assistance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the security of Fort Leavenworth . ' " This seemed to convince him . He ' yessired ' politely and told us to wait while he and the guards upstairs brought down the women . With that same maddening slowness of a fat gila monster moving uphill , he turned and climbed the stairs , and the creaking of the stairs under his weight joined the ominous sounds of the walls around us . It seemed that the swirling of dust particles had thickened a bit . ' After a few minutes that dragged endlessly , we heard female voices on the landing above . Margaret and another woman , who was , I believe , McCorkle 's sister , Mrs. Charity Kerr , were the first to be led down . Their dresses were ripped and soiled and their hands were bound in front of them . Margaret 's eyes widened with amazement when she saw me , but she caught my quick headshake and said nothing . " ' Here 's two of ' em , captain . We 'll go fetch the others . ' ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , I took Margaret in my arms and held her . " ' You 're all right now , ' I whispered . ' I 'm taking you out of here . ' How little I knew . How little I expected the disaster that was almost upon us , though I might have guessed when I kissed Margaret 's hair and found it covered with powder and particles from the crumbling ceilings and when I felt through my own boot soles a tremor running through the old house.  | " ' Johnny , I ca n't believe it , ' she said in the breaking voice of one holding back a sob . ' You 're here ! ' She burrowed her head against my chest , and I wanted desperately to cut the rope bindings around her wrists , but I did n't dare for fear of arousing the fat sergeant 's suspicions . " Then suddenly a large piece of plaster fell from the ceiling almost at our feet , and we heard shouting and screams from upstairs . More plaster fell around us and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earthquake . A guard with a musket appeared in the doorway to the staircase shouting , ' Run for your lives ! It 's all coming down ! ' He was closely followed by the fat sergeant , who had suddenly acquired the fleetness of an Indian runner . From upstairs could be heard the screams of the women : ' Help us ! Please help us ! ' But the two bluebellies gave no sign of hearing . They ran on past us out the front door . " ' Let me go , Johnny ! ' Margaret cried out then , freeing herself from my arms . " ' You ca n't help them , Margaret ! ' I shouted over the cracking and rumbling of the collapsing house . But she would n't listen . " ' Becky ! ' she called out to her sister as she ran toward the stairs . Mrs. Kerr followed her across the room , and by the time I reached the stairs the two of them had climbed back up into that vomiting hellmouth of dust and crumbling debris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , and as I reached the second landing I saw Margaret just ahead of me . I called to her ; she stopped for an instant and looked back , pleading , ' Help me , Johnny . ' Then she ran on down the hall toward the screaming that rose above the cracking of rotten timbers and the crash of falling beams . I started to follow , but something , a beam probably , came down like a club and left me senseless . " I hesitate to say that I was unconscious , for while I was no longer capable of moving like a conscious man , doing what needed to be done , I was strangely conscious of what was happening around me . I saw a figure , a woman silhouetted in the dim light of the hallway , trying to drag another figure toward me . There was a shower of debris and heavy objects , beams and pieces of the roof , and the woman was beaten to the floor , where she lay still for several moments . Then she raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dragging , bent over it and her shoulders trembled with her sobbing . 1 Ier face was concealed by her long hair , but as she raised herself in an attitude of supplication , lifting hands that were bound together at the wrists , I saw who she was , and when I heard her cry out my name again it wasp178like the touch of that iron Walley 's sergeant laid across my belly . I tried to reach out to her , and when I could n't , I began to scream with the pain I was feeling . " ' Easy , Mr. Ringgold , take it easy . ' The voice came from someone very close by me , close enough to speak softly and be heard above the sounds of the falling house . ' We gon na make it . ' I was conscious then of Noland lifting and dragging me down the stairs , and I wanted to make him leave me , tried to speak , but nothing came out except a moaning like some speechless idiot 's cry . Then I blacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I lay in the bed of the wagon we had brought for the women , rain spattering down on me revived the capacity to feel pain in my head and other parts of my body that had been struck by falling debris , but this was nothing compared to what I felt remembering what had happened . The same falling debris striking me had struck Margaret , buried her in that house . I already knew , even before Noland told me , that I had lost her . " ' Dead . They 's all dead . ' He gripped my wrist when he said it , having stopped the wagon and climbed back to check on me when he saw that I had come to . " ' Why did n't you leave me , dammit ? ' I said , barely able to control my voice . " ' Your lady would n't want that , Mr. Ringgold . I seen her go back tryin ' to save them others . She want you to live . ' " We hardly knew each other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to say something that checked my first impulse to follow Margaret as quickly as I could put a gun to my head . I turned away from him and wept like a goddamn baby . He patted me very gently on the arm , then he climbed back onto the seat and started the team . After a while I climbed up beside him , and we drove slowly through the hub-deep mud and sloshing rain back to Quantrill 's camp without exchanging another word . " Cole , McCorkle and a couple of Anderson 's men were waiting for us at the edge of the camp . ' Well ? ' McCorkle demanded . I just shook my head and looked over at Noland . He understood that I was in no condition to describe what had happened , so he began . He told them how the building had taken the building next to it down as well and how rescuers were at work digging the women out of the rubble but that there was no hope that any of them would be found alive . He himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying unconscious in the wagon . As we soon liundp179out , there was one survivor , Mary Anderson , but she was left a cripple for life . " I 'm told that when Anderson was informed of his sisters ' murder he literally went crazy and started foaming at the mouth . Whether this is true or not , I have no doubt that the blood lust we all saw him display that earned him the name ' Bloody Bill ' was ignited at that moment , even as my own living coal of rage and hatred was fanned to life by Noland 's account of what I had only partly seen . He had n't told me about seeing the victims dug out , and though he refused to say one way or the other , I could guess that one of them was Margaret . " When Noland had finished , I climbed down off the wagon and started toward my lean-to . The rain had stopped , but a cold chilling breeze began to whip through the camp . My teeth chattered and my head was throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cole were weeping openly for their sisters , but I did n't join them . The time for mourning has passed , I told myself . Dizzy and swaying but nonetheless determined , I stumbled on toward my lean-to . Inside it was my saddle , along with the three pistols I carried when I was n't trying to pass myself off as a Yank officer . I wanted to tear off the uniform I was still wearing , but then I decided it was just what I needed for the piece of work I had in mind . Would n't those bastards in Kansas City be surprised to be cut down by one of their own officers ! " Where are you going , Ringgold ? ' George Todd called to me as I slung my saddle up on my shoulder and started toward the pasture where our horses were grazing . I did n't answer him , and he started following me , along with Cole , who must have told him what had happened , and some other fellows . As I slipped Blaze 's bridle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder with one of his big powerful stonemason 's hands and asked me again , ' Where are you going ? ' " Without any thought whatever , I whirled around and drove my fist into his jaw , and he went down flat on his back in the grass . I guess I really did n't know what I was doing because , having just struck the most dangerousman in Quantrill 's hand in the face , I turned back to the business of saddling my horse as though nothing had happened . But now Cole grabbed me from behind and with the help of Will McGuire wrestled me down onto the ground . Then Cole held my arms while Todd sat on me and kept me pinned to the ground with his weight . You damn fixil ! ' ' Iixld snarled down at me . There was a trickle ofp180blood coming out of the corner of his mouth where I 'd hit him , and I fully expected him to even things up now that I was helpless under him . ' Bet you was goin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City to kill yourself a few Yankees . Was n't that it ? ' he demanded . " ' You guessed it , and you are n't stopping me , ' I snarled back at him , hating him as much at that instant as I hated any of our enemies . " ' Well , first you listen to me , Mr. Yank killer . You want to hurt theYanks ? You really want to hurt ' em ? ' " I did n't reply , and Todd went on . " ' Colonel Quantrill 's plannin ' somethin ' big , and he needs every man he 's got . If you 're man enough , he can use you . ' " Cole was speaking to me . ' John , she was my sister . Believe me , I want to make ' em pay , too . ' " I let go of my rage then , and they let me up . Todd was wiping the blood off his chin with a bandanna . " ' I 'm mighty sorry about that , George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , ' he replied magnanimously . ' You was n't yourself . ' Then he chuckled and rubbed his jaw . ' Damn , you hit hard ! ' " Cole said to me : ' We 're going to make ' em pay , John . Believe me , we are . ' After they left me , assured that I would n't be making a one-man attack on Kansas City , I finished saddling Blaze and rode out toward the Missouri River . Noland 's words were still pounding in my head  --  ' Dead . They 's all dead '  --  but I could n't really accept at first that this meant Margaret too . By the time I reached the river , though , I had come to accept it . Dismounting beside that big muddy monster I looked down into its greenish-brownswirling depths and found myself strongly impelled by a yearning to throw myself into them . It must have been how my father felt the night he chose to die , and it even occurred to me that his way might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and checked'the cylinder . Why not ? I asked myself Killing Walley had n't brought back Harry Younger . Killing all the bluebellies in Kansas would n't bring Margaret back to me . " I really might have done it then , but I seemed to hear a voice coming right up from those dark river currents and calling me by name . I remembered then something Margaret said to me the last time we were together : Johnny , I know we 'll always be near each other , no matter what happens . If you ever think you 've lost me , remember that I 'm always near you . Just listen for me . ' It was , I thought at the time , a strange thing to say , but it , moved me deeply , and I wanted to believe it . She had always beenp181telling me to listen , to poetry out of the night , to the sounds of autumn , and now she was telling me to listen for her voice , even when I thought it was beyond hearing . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , along with those deep warm feelings and the yearning to believe her . A part of me sensed that I was going to lose her . She must have known herself that something was going to happen to her . " Ringgold , what 're you doin ' ? ' It was John McCorkle . " Just visiting the river , John , ' I answered . " Wal , I 've been looking all over for you . Quantrill wants to talk to both of us . I think we 're going to get a chance to pay back those murdering bastards . ' " ' Where do you think we 're going ? ' I asked McCorkle as we rode back to camp . " ' I figure a raid on Kansas City , ' he said . This suited me just fine , and I was grateful to Todd and Cole for preventing me from riding in there all by myself . Hearing , or thinking I 'd heard Margaret 's voice had the effect of expelling some of my suicidal thoughts , and McCorkle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastards ' diminished my sense of the futility of revenge . Admittedly , revenge would not bring back those women we loved , but it was n't right that we should leave that crime unavenged . " Quantrill knew all about the murders , and he knew that both McCorkle and I were close to some of the victims . As always , he knew what to say : " ' Gentlemen , ' he began , I want you to know that I sympathize deeply with you in your grief . It 's bad enough that they are driving our people out of Missouri and hanging our men like criminals when they capture them . Now they are murdering our women . It shows you how the abolitionists think . They do not respect the codes of honor and chivalry . They respect nothing but fire and the sword ! ' Also present in Quantrill 's tent were Todd , Bill Anderson , Andy Blunt , Dick Yeager , Bill Gregg and 01 Shepherd . Our arrival had apparently interrupted a meeting of Quantrill and his lieutenants , but having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of our role as scouts . " As I was just telling these other gentlemen , it 's time we quit letting the damned abolitionists have their way , time we quit letting the Red Legs come over here and attack our people with impunity . I say , let 's go to Lawrence ! ' At that , the lieutenants looked around at each other , and some of he 'll shook their heads . Lawrence , as Gregg and others began to point out ,  |p182was  a long way from home , almost forty miles inside Kansas , and no small village either . Not that they would n't enjoy putting the torch to Lawrence . Lawrence was , we all knew , the home of Jim Lane and the headquarters of the Red Legs , whom I guess you would have to call our northern counterparts , though I 'd like to think we never sank quite to their level . Even General Ewing despised the Red Legs and denounced them in a speech in Olathe for stealing themselves rich in the name of liberty . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never joined my comrades in scalping dead Federal soldiers , I did occasionally adorn Blaze 's bridle with Reg Leg hair . Lawrence was their town , but cleaning it out of those animals was not enough of an inducement by itself . Quantrill knew this , so he went on : " ' Lawrence is the great hotbed of abolitionism in Kansas . All the plunder , or the bulk of it , stolen from Missouri in the name of liberty , will be found stored in Lawrence . We can get more money there , and . . . ' He paused to look around at McCorkle and me and then over at Bill Anderson. . . . more revenge than anywhere else . ' Again Gregg and the others began to argue that a raid on Lawrence was too dangerous . Quantrill proceeded to answer each of their arguments . It turned out that he and two of his men had just recently scouted most of the country between the state line and Lawrence . There were a few Federal outposts , but they were spread out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not many people lived in that country . There would be few to raise the alarm . Todd , Anderson and Andy Blunt were quickly won over , but Gregg and 01 Shepherd were not . Lawrence had its own home guards , who would fortify themselves inside the town 's brick buildings , and even if we managed to take the town there was the matter of getting back to Missouri . Quantrill answered that they could be in and out of Lawrence before the home guards could get into action and certainly before any kind of pursuit could be organized . His most persuasive arguments that this was possible were there in the flesh before their very eyes  --  Dick Yeager and Bill Anderson . Back in May , Yeager had led two dozen of his Jackson County boys 130 miles into Kansas following the Sante Fe Trail all the way to Council Grove . On the way back he lost about half of his men killed or captured , but the rest of them managed easily to evade the posses and troops sent out to intercept them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was forced to flee to Missouri by his Unionist neighbors , had gone along with Yeager 's bunch to pay his former neighbors a visit . They raised a fair amount of hell by all accounts , and there was so much criticism of General Blunt byp183the Kansas folks that he felt compelled to hang Jim Vaughn publicly as an example to the rest of us partisans . " Listening to them argue , I could see why Gregg and Shepherd feared being caught forty miles inside Kansas , but right from the start I was with Quantrill . It was his talk of revenge mainly , and the risks meant nothing because I have never been so ready to die . Having Margaret taken from me , crushed in the ruins of a deathtrap because she tried to save her sister , had left me without any reason to live other than revenge . Dying in the Red Leg capital after I had taken along a few for company would suit me just fine . " Quantrill 's arguments were in fact persuasive . If Yeager and his bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Missouri , why could n't we make it into and out of Lawrence ? It was , after all , less than a third the distance . Finally , Quantrill had them all won over . He had an amazing gift for winning trust and confidence , and he could persuade men to put themselves in danger . That Latin line Professor Grimestone called on me to translate came back : Caesare duce , nihil timebimus . With Caesar in command , we shall fear nothing . " Four days later we all rode out of Blue Springs and headed south to a farm near Lee 's Summit . On the way there , Todd ordered me and five other men to follow him . We left the main column and rode to the house of a man named Wallace . He called Wallace outside and proceeded to scare hell out of him . " ' You Yank-lovin ' sonofabitch ! ' he snarled . ' We know you 're giving information to the Federals . ' Then he drew out one of his pistols . " Wallace went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George showed him what was perhaps the closest thing to mercy he could manage . He leaned down and pistol-whipped the man , saying : " ' If we hear any more about you talking to the Federals , we 'll come back here and kill you . ' " Then George really amazed us . He got off his horse and went inside the house . There was an organ in the parlor , and George actually sat down and played it for about ten minutes , played a couple of hymns I recognized . A man of many talents , our Captain Todd . As we rejoined the main band , riding into the camp at Lee 's Summit , we could hear Bill Anderson shouting at Quantrill , ' Jest ten years old ! Wo n't never walk again ! God damn ' em to hell ! ' The news had just arrived that Mary Anderson was now the only survivor of the disaster in Kansas City , and Quantrill had just tactfully expressed his sympathy to herp184brother . Anderson was a powerfully built fellow in his early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair and beard , and gray eyes , which were generally expressionless yet filled during moments of high excitement with a kind of demonic light . Quantrill listened to his curse , and a little smile started to play about the corners of his hard , thin-lipped mouth . My guess is that he was privately congratulating himself on the timing of his Lawrence raid . At no other time could he have found Anderson and the rest of us in such a ready , determined state . ' As Anderson walked over to rejoin his men , I noticed one of them who looked familiar , a tall , lanky , sandy-haired fellow . He noticed me at the same time . " ' You a cousin of the Youngers ? ' he asked me . " ' Yes , that 's right . I 'm John Ringgold , from Texas . ' " ' Well , I guess we 're related , too . I 'm Frank James . As I recall , we met at Christmastime a couple of years ago . ' " We shook hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't you ? ' " ' Still do . Jesse . He 's back home at our place near Liberty , just itchin ' to join up with us . He 's only sixteen , though , so we told him he 'd have to wait a little while . After the damned Unionist militia tortured our stepdaddy , I joined up with Anderson . It 's a good outfit . How long you been with Quantrill ? ' " ' Two years now . ' " ' I 've been with Anderson about a year . I hope he and Quantrill can work together . ' As we were talking , a short , blond youngster sidled up , and Frank James introduced us . " ' This here 's Arch Clement . ' ' As we shook hands , I remarked to myself upon the almost cherubic appearance of innocence the young fellow had . He could n't have been over twenty and looked younger . There was little in that rosy-cheeked , blue-eyed countenance to suggest that he was a born killer who would make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never imagined ' Little Archie , ' as we came to call him , scalping dead Yank soldiers . You would never imagine it , that is , until you saw him do it . " Thinking about what followed , how I came to be one in spirit with ' Bloody Bill ' and ' Little Archie , ' I wonder again about how deep in hell , if there is a hell outside this infernal earth , I 'll be planted . Not that I really care that much . My revenge for Margaret 's death was hardly sweet , but at the time I 'd have sold my soul for it . Maybe I still would , and if that 's what I did , so be it . The devil was the god of that war , and his instrument , hisp185Mephistopheles , if you will , was named William Clarke Quantrill . Here 's to you , Quantrill . You were a fiend out of hell , but you were the leader we wanted . Thinking about the hell we created with you on August 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't written much today , I see , but I need to fortify myself a bit to go on . At times I 've drunk to forget what happened that day , what we did to earn our name . But now , having brought back again the agony of learning that Margaret was dead , I think that I can bring back that other day as well . I 'm drinking now , not to escape but to make it clearer , so that tomorrow I can set it down just as it happened . " " That Quantrill was absolutely right about Lawrence 's vulnerability to attack was confirmed by the two spies he sent ahead to look the place over , Fletch Taylor and good old Noland . And so it was that we found ourselves on the morning of August 21 on the outskirts of Lawrence . We had ridden all night to get there . Along the way we 'd met a Colonel Holt with a hundred new Confederate recruits . When Quantrill asked him if he 'd like his boys ' christened , ' Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All together , Quantrill had a force of about 450 men . " The streets of Lawrence were deserted when we rode in . It was about five o'clock , and the thick dust of the main street , Massachusetts Street , I believe it was called , muffled our hoofbeats . When we reached the center of town , Quantrill ordered Colonel Holt to take his company of recruits and prevent anyone from escaping from the east side of town . Then he told Andy Blunt to take a detachment and cover the west side . " Our first target was a tent camp over near the Wakarusa River occupied by some Kansas Federals . There were only about twenty of them , and they had the look of raw recruits . We just literally trampled them into the ground in their tents , and I do n't believe more than two or three could have gotten away . One of our men , a former Baptist preacher and former Border Ruffian by the name of Larkin Skaggs , took down their U.S. flag and tied it to his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us liked Skaggs , but his gesture with the flag expressed what we all felt pretty accurately . " Next we turned our attention to another camp nearby , where a hunch of colored soldiers were bivouacked . Some of our boys had a special hatred for Negro Federal troops . Personally , I did n't give a damn what color a man 's skin was inside his unifOrm . As long as the uniform was blue , I 'd try to kill him , and the death of a white Federal gave me fully as much satisfaction as the death of a black one . These darkies were pretty fiirtunate . They saw what we 'd done to their white comrades , and most of them got away.  | " Having taken care of these camps , we were ordered by Quantrill to surround the Eldridge House , which was a big four-story hotel in the middle of Lawrence . It was one of those big brick buildings Gregg and Shepherd had worried about , and we were a little apprehensive as we approached it , seeing how easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , we all dismounted and took cover , expecting a fusillade from the windows . But not a shot was fired . A Yank captain by the name of Banks stuck his head out one of the windows waving a white bedsheet . " ' I want to speak to your commander , ' he yelled down at us . " Quantrill promptly climbed back on his horse and rode up beneath the window . " ' What are you after here in Lawrence ? ' the captain asked him . " ' Plunder , ' Quantrill answered frankly . " ' Well , we are defenseless and at your mercy . We surrender this house , but we demand protection for everyone in it . ' " ' You have it , ' Quantrill assured him , ' as long as no one in there resists . ' " ' Hey , captain , ' Todd called up to the officer . ' Come on down here . ' " The man complied , and when he came out on the porch , George walked up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . I 'll give you jest two minutes to surrender that uniform . It jest happens I 'm a captain myself , and I need a uniform . Ai n't that right , colonel ? ' " Quantrill just chuckled a little . Then he stood up in his stirrups and addressed the rest of us . " ' Kill ! Kill and you will make no mistake ! ' he shouted , and he went on : ' Lawrence should be thoroughly cleansed , and the only way to cleanse it is to kill ! Kill ! ' " We responded with wild Indian whoops , rebel yells and shouts of joy . This was what we 'd wanted to hear . Quantrill raised his arm to quiet us , just long enough to deliver one other command that we did n't mind obeying : " ' You are not to harm any of the women or children . But kill all the men you see . Any man you see here is liable to be a Red Leg or a Jayhawker . They 're all abolitionist Yankee sonsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any less involved in what followed than any of my comrades . We broke up into small hands and spread out through the town . Quantrill 's final words had sunk in , and I found myself shooting atp187practically every adult male I saw . Some I killed outright . Others I just wounded , and my comrades generally finished them off . Their women tried to protect them sometimes , and we left quite a few being mourned over by grieving widows . Women were not otherwise harmed by us in Lawrence . None were raped . None were killed . I could not feel much sympathy for the grieving women of Lawrence , as I had for the women in Olathe and Shawneetown . I could n't feel much of anything besides a strange kind of pleasure I 'd never known before . It was the pleasure of complete abandonment . The people I was killing were n't human beings . They were Red Legs , Jayhawkers , Yankees , Margaret 's killers . I did n't feel anything but a compulsion to get as many as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched up behind a balcony railing and who may or may not have been aiming at me , Quantrill rode by . " ' Nice shooting , Ringgold , ' he yelled , and he put one of his own bullets into the corpse that my shot had draped over the railing on the balcony . As he did so , he laughed aloud , a shrill , high-pitched laugh that I 'd heard before , the time we wiped out a patrol near Blue Springs , when we were riding them down and he killed one himself . It was the kind of laugh you might expect from the devil himself as he watched the arrival of some new souls . If I heard it now , it would give me the same kind of chills I felt when that old medicine man was going crazy in Cochise 's cave . But then I just laughed right along with him as I reloaded my pistols . ' And I rode along with him when he went to pay his respects to Jim Lane . According to one of our spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he had n't been , while Noland was there . So Quantrill was in no great hurry to get to Lane 's house . What we did n't know was that Lane had returned a day or two before the raid . Hearing us shooting up the town , he scampered out into a cornfield near his house with nothing but his nightshirt on and hid there until we left . Had we caught him , Quantrill would have been able to carry out his original plan , which was to bring Lane back to Missouri to be burned at the stake . " When we rode up to Lane 's house , we were met by his wife , and I must admit I was much impressed by the kind of spirit she showed . Quantrill dismounted and took off his hat with a great flourish , saying , ' I 'd be grateful , Mrs. Lane , if you 'd inform your distinguished husband , Senator Lane , that Colonel Quantrill desires an audience with him . ' " She was a handsome woman in her middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Margaret 's . Picking up Quantrill 's tonep188of mock gallantry , she replied in kind : ' I regret to inform you , colonel , that my husband is not presently at home to receive visitors . Perhaps he may see you another time . ' " ' Let us hope so , Mrs. Lane , ' Quantrill answered dryly . ' Now , if you wo n't mind , we 'll just take a look around the senator 's home . Boys . ' He gestured for us to go inside the house . Mrs. Lane stood to one side of the doorway , rigidly erect and with a proudly defiant expression on her face . She looked me directly in the eye as I walked by her , and I had to look away . Lane was a real sonofabitch , by all our accounts , but somehow he 'd gotten himself quite a woman for a wife . " When we went inside the parlor , McCorkle exclaimed : " ' By God , here 's the Fristos ' piano ! And this one belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellows with us in the house , it was full of loot from Lane 's raid on Osceola back in the fall of ' sixtyone . We went upstairs and one of the fellows went into Mrs. Lane 's bedroom . He came out with a load of silk dresses . " ' I reckon most of these belong to the girls back in Osceola , ' he said . We 'd heard that Lane had taken as his personal share of the Osceola spoils a number of silk dresses to distribute among his female friends , but I suspect that these belonged to Mrs. Lane . " Since Noland had told Quantrill that Lane was out of town , we did n't look for him outside , and he was smart enough to stay where he was in the cornfield . " ' Okay , boys , ' Quantrill said , when we 'd finished looting and searchingthe house , ' I guess there 's nothing else to do but touch her off . ' Mrs. Lane stood by and watched us set fire to the place , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see tears starting in her fine eyes . The house , a splendid , newly built wooden structure , went up very quickly . And so did most of the town . As we rode back down Massachusetts Street toward the business district , we had burning houses on either side of us . There were bodies lying everywhere  --  in the street , on the sidewalks , in the yards and gardens around the burning houses . Among the glowing embers of one house , I saw a skull and some bones sticking up , and a little further on I saw two guerrillas in the process of heaving a man into the flames of a burning house with his hands and feet tied . ' This is for Osceola ! ' one of the guerrillas yelled as he let go . ' And Jennison ! ' the other one yelled . " The screams of the dying and the crackling of the flames filled our cars , send the smell of burning flesh , the most sickening odor I know , filledp189our nostrils . It had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obscured by a thick cloud of smoke and rising ashes . From time to time Quantrill laughed aloud in that strange shrill way he had , and we all laughed along with him . " Down in the center of town we encountered Bill Anderson and Arch Clement . Anderson had a pistol in either hand , and he , like Quantrill , was laughing , only it came out as a kind of sobbing or whimpering . His eyes were full of that same light I 'd noticed earlier , and he did n't seem to even recognize us . ' Little Archie ' was tying something to the bridle of his horse . It looked like the skin of a small animal , but then I saw the corpse of a Federal soldier lying nearby with a bloody crown where his scalp had been . " Then we met Cole and Frank James . They were just coming out of a bank , each carrying sacks of money . " ' Give us a hand , will you , John ? ' Frank called to me . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri receive some compensation for what these damned Red Legs have done to them . ' " ' Sure , ' I said , and went back inside with them to help clean out the vault . As a matter of fact , every bank in Lawrence was robbed that day . The idea of bringing money back from the Red Leg capital to the suffering folks of Missouri had a lot of appeal , probably made some of the raiders feel like Robin Hoods . But I 'm afraid this noble scheme never was carried out . It was , as far as I know , the first time Cole and Frank had worked together to empty a bank . Of course , as everyone knows now , it was by no means the last . ' As we finished with the bank and went on to loot some stores , I noticed that most of the men around me had been drinking . What with all I 'd seen and done that morning , I needed a drink myself , and when some of Anderson 's boys went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we got inside I went behind the bar and set up the glasses . Then when I 'd poured us each a tall whiskey , I raised my glass and said , without really thinking about why I said it : " ' Here 's to the South . And victory . ' " They all raised their glasses , and after that toast we had a few more  --  to Anderson , to Quantrill , to our ladies back in Missouri , to the good fellowship of comrades in war . " ' Mount up ! ' We all heard the order being shouted out in the street , and I recognized the voice as that of ' Ibdd . By this time , we were none too sober , but we managed to stumble out into the street and locate our horses . ' Judd , mounted on his big stud Stun Gary and resplendent in Captain Banks 's uniform , slotted me and rule over.  | " How do I look , John ? ' " ' Mighty fine , George . Shplendid , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outta here fast , John . The lookout reported there 's a big bunch of troops comin ' in from the east . ' " Mount up ! Mount up ! ' It was Quantrill himself this time . Seeing George , he rode over to him and gave his orders for the retreat : South end of town , George . Tell Gregg to form them up there in fours . Have somebody hitch up a wagon for the wounded . ' We had in fact suffered only three casualties so far . Jim Bledsoe and two of Holt 's recruits had been wounded by some soldiers and surveyors stationed across the Kansas River who 'd cut loose at us with their rifles . Holt 's recruits generally seemed to be having a hard time at their christening . ' I saw a couple of them retching in the streets , and some others were looking pretty sick . Looking at them , I remembered how I 'd been christened ' that day in the ravine , and I thought to myself , You 've come a long way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting our men , as well as those of Anderson and Yeager , to leave off their looting , drinking and other activities and to ride down to the south end of Lawrence , where Gregg began forming them up for the retreat . " Meanwhile , Todd ordered me and six others to help him round up the stragglers . We succeeded in rounding up all save one . Larkin Skaggs , the ex-Reverend Larkin Skaggs , was so drunk and evidently so caught up in the excitement of killing and burning that he did n't even hear us when we shouted at him to go join the others . He and another man were coming out of a hotel where some townsfolk were being held as prisoners . " ' They 've killed the prisoners ! ' we heard a woman screaming , and this was probably true . Skaggs had a gun in each hand as he staggered over to his horse and climbed on . His companion heard our shouts and rode to join the others , but Skaggs went off in the opposite direction . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's house and then , when he realized belatedly that we 'd all gone , he panicked . Still too drunk to ride in the right direction and frightened out of his wits besides , he was trapped by a mob of angry surviving citizens and killed . Some of the Negro soldiers who had escaped our attack on their camp untied the U.S. flag from his horse 's tail and tied Skaggs ' body , stripped naked , in its place . Then they dragged it through the streets of Lawrence . " Skaggs was the only guerrilla killed in Lawrence , and I did n't notice anyone mourning the loss . We only wished that we could have given him some company in whatever part of hell is reserved for murdering preachers byp191sending down the soul of the Reverend H. D. Fisher , chaplain in Lane 's Kansas Brigade . He was high on our list of special victims to be paid off for atrocities in Missouri . But his wife saved him by rolling him up inside a rug , dragging him out into the backyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set fire to their house and stood around waiting for him to emerge . Another spirited woman , like Mrs. Lane , whom I have to admire . It 's a wonder to me how those miserable Jayhawking bastards could have won the devotion of such fine brave women . But then I guess the whole mystery of woman 's love is beyond any man 's power to grasp . Why women have loved me is certainly more than I can grasp . As we started to ride out of Lawrence , Frank James rode up to Quantrill , saying : There 's about sixty Red Legs come into town . Had n't some of us boys better go back and take care of ' em ? ' " Quantrill shook his head and pointed out across the prairies , off to the east and then off to the north , where you could just make out the dust clouds raised by large bodies of mounted troops . You boys , ' he told us , are going to have all the fighting you want , all the way back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to make it at all . ' " He was dead right about this , as he usually was about anything connected with mounted guerrilla warfare . You can say what you will about Quantrill as a man . He was a ruthless killer who enjoyed his work , and I suspect that he was an opportunist who used the situation on the KansasMissouriborder to his own advantage and did n't basically care a damn about the South or that part of the South in Missouri he was supposedly championing . But he was a superb cavalry leader , in the same class , I suspect , with Morgan or Stuart or even Forrest , old " fustest with the mostest . " And he proved it on the Lawrence raid , among others . I 'm not talking about the massacre itself . That , admittedly , was no great achievement , just so much necessary , or unnecessary , butchery , more like a mass execution than anything else . But getting to and from Lawrence through eighty miles of largely open territory swarming with Yankees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hesitated to undertake . And it was in the retreat especially that he showed us what kind of a leader he was . " Leaving the smoking ruins of Lawrence , we soon picked up the Santa Fe Trail and headed east . When we reached a little place called Brooklyn , we left the trail and picked up a road running south toward another little place called Ottawa . But we had n't gotten very far south of Brooklyn l firrc we harked back and saw that one of those big pursuing colurnns was catching up fist . As some of the men looked back and saw thep192Federals , they began to panic and tried to gallop ahead of each other in the line . Their panic really showed when we rode up on a wide fenced cornfield and found that the only way across it was along a very narrow lane running through the middle of it . The men bunched up in the lane , crowding each other , and when they got to the end of it and reached open prairie again , they began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who 'd helped him round up the stragglers were back near the rear of the column . George saw at a glance what was happening and what needed to be done in a hurry . As we came through the gate at the end of the field , he swung his big stud about and stopped about twenty of the men behind him . " Hold on a minute , boys . Ai n't none of us gettin ' back to Missouri if we do n't stop them Yankees . Goddammit , Smith , stay where you are ! ' he yelled at a guerrilla who was edging his mount away toward the retreating column . Jarrett , ' he addressed another guerrilla , with a gray beard down to his belt , you take half these men . Let down those rail fences and go on up through the corn so you can hit ' em in the flank . By God , we 're gon na charge ' em ! ' And by God , or the devil , we did . We rode back up the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismounted , and five of us , including George , 01 Shepherd , Jim Lilly , Will McGuire and I , stood shoulder to shoulder in front while the fellows behind us held our horses . The Yankees came right on , having seen from a distance the signs of panic in our ranks and therefore neglecting to exercise enough caution even to have scouts out in front . They were riding four abreast and did n't even see us until they were less than fifty feet away . It was one of those rare times when I used two pistols at once . While I 'm a reasonable shot with my left-hand Colt 's , I generally keep it in reserve and do most of my work with my faster right hand . But this time I had a Colt 's in either hand , as did each of my comrades . Those bluebellies and their horses in the first rank were hit by so many bullets that they just went down in one big cursing , screaming , whinnying heap . And so did the rank behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to stop , so they began piling up on top of those in front . Then , as George had promised , we mounted our horses and charged them . " We had a little difficulty getting around the pile of men and animals that seemed to be rising as high as a house , and George 's magnificent horse was shot from under him in the charge , but we went on to stop them cold with another fusillade . One of their officers seemed to be rallying them for ap193countercharge , but then he went down , apparently hit from the side . Good old Jarrett was attacking their flank . " With the Yank advance temporarily halted , we turned back down the lane and caught up with Quantrill and the rest . Todd climbed up behind me , and I noticed that he 'd discarded his new captain 's tunic . " ' I hated to give up my new coat , but I do n't feel like getting shot by one of my own boys , ' he explained . Then suddenly he cursed aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenbacks in that coat ! ' I had to laugh at this . " ' Good thing it was n't Confederate money . You might have lost something , ' I said with a chuckle . He tried to force a laugh in spite of his disappointment , for we 'd often wondered out loud if Confederate money had as little value in Virginia as it had out west . " When we caught up with the main column , George took his pick from among the many horses we 'd rounded up in Lawrence . These horses were mostly too fat to maintain our pace for any length of time , but we started riding them and leading our good Missouri mounts to let them rest . This was Quantrill 's idea and a good one , for it gave us our final edge over the pursuing Federal cavalry . But we had a long way to go , and the Federals , having re-formed , were closing in again on us . Quantrill called George over . " That was damned fine , George . We 're all much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that detachment . ' " Think nothing of it , colonel , ' Todd replied easily . ' We want to get back to Missouri just like everybody else . ' " I 'll see that you 're rewarded when we do get back , George . Butright now I need to rely some more on your skills as a rear-guard commander . If there 's any man here who can take charge of securing our rear , it 's you . Pickout fifty or sixty of the best men for a rear guard and throw out a skirmish line . I know the country and will take the main body and lead them out . If Irun into any Federals in front of me , I 'm going to cut right through them . ' " George immediately rounded up the best shots in our outfit , which , thanks to 01 Shepherd 's tutelage , included me , and he asked Anderson andYeager to give him their best as well . He then divided us into two groups , twenty-five men each , and these became two skirmish lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other line , a few hundred yardsbehind them , was loading up . In this way , we slowed the enemy downconsiderably and prevented their attempts to concentrate an attack . Theliquor 1 'd drunk that morning had long since worn off , and I found that I wasp194placing my shots with deadly effect , as were my comrades on either side . George was pleased . " Nice shooting , boys , mighty nice . Keep it up , ' he said , between his own well-aimed shots . Guess I know how to pick a rear guard . ' And so it went through the long hot August afternoon . The Federals gradually began to wear down , and so did we . By the middle of the afternoon , all the excitement of the raid was gone , and the only thing keeping us going was the fear of capture . I looked around me and saw the prairie strewn with plunder discarded by the main column , everything from furniture and saddle gear to women 's hats and dresses . I 'd taken no plunder myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little resentful then that I was working so much harder than the plunder carriers in the main column . Some of the Federals seemed to be swaying in their saddles and letting their horses just drift across the prairie . I knew how they felt . We 'd been in the saddle close to twenty-four hours ourselves . In my weariness , I remembered something Harry Younger had prodded me to read , Thucydides ' account of the Athenian retreat from Syracuse in his History of the Peloponnesian War . It was the wrong thing to think about then , I guess . The Athenians had all been either wiped out or captured . But then they had a fool for a general . Thank God , or the devil , we had Quantrill and Todd . " Fire at will ! ' George yelled hoarsely as each line took its turn against the weary Federal advance . Then , when the line behind was ready : Fall back ! ' What got us through , no question , was the big string of spare mounts we 'd appropriated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider would just shoot it and help himself to another . The Federals had no spare mounts , and by the end of the day their horses could n't be prodded into anything faster than a slow walk . About sunset , just as we came in sight of Paola , Quantrill called a halt and pulled out his spyglass to look the town over . The first thing he saw was a line of troops , about one hundred of them , drawn up to defend the town against him . It seems the whole of eastern Kansas had been alerted as to our presence , and troops from all over that part of the state were joining in the attempt to intercept us . Even as we halted there in sight of Paola , the Federals who had been pursuing us all day were joined by a fresh company of Kansas militia , and our rear-guard action just could n't hold them off . We were driven back onto the main guerrilla body . Quantrill met this crisis with his usual cool competence , by simply turning his entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose the Kansans . This the Kansans had n't been expecting , and they promptly drew rein . Then the rest of thep195Federals caught up with them , and we just sat there for a while facing each other , thoroughly exhausted , each side waiting for the other to make the first move . " Finally Quantrill ordered us to form back into columns of fours , and we rode northward around Paola . The Federals , I gather , just went on into Paola . They 'd ruined most of their horses , and some of the troops themselves had died of sunstroke . We only kept going for about five miles beyond Paola . Then Quantrill halted us for a rest . God , did we need a rest ! Especially those of us who 'd been with Todd 's rear guard . Somehow I knew , though , that I would n't be getting much rest . " ' Ringgold ! McCorkle ! ' John and I groaned as we heard our names being called . There 's no rest for a scout . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army sleeps he 'd better be awake . " ' I 'd like you boys to keep a lookout , ' Quantrill informed us . We just nodded dumbly and turned our horses back the way we 'd come . I borrowed some tobacco from McCorkle and rubbed it around my eyes to keep them open . Then I rode my horse , which had been led most of the day , up to a ridgetop from which I could survey the country between us and Paola . Fighting to stay awake in the saddle , I cursed Quantrill , but sure enough , he was right again . Not even an hour passed before I made out the approach of another damned Union column . McCorkle had seen them too , and when we got back to Quantrill , he and Todd and the other officers set about rousting the men , which was no easy task . Some had to be kicked to their feet . When they 'd all managed to haul themselves back into the saddle , we moved out and did n't stop again until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd been in Missouri since about midnight , but did n't want to stop until we were well beyond the state line . As we reached a line of timber along the Grand , Quantrill halted us and rode back along the line shouting joyfully : ' We did it , boys ! We did it ! Now we 're back home again . Not all the troops in Kansas can catch us now . ' " For the first time in the course of that raid , Quantrill was wrong . As he found out with his own spyglass , there was a big bunch of Kansas troops still on our tail , and a farmer informed us that a large force of Missouri state militia was just over the next hill looking for us . Up to this point , we 'd suffered few casualties . Two men had been killed outright during the retreat and three more , who had been wounded too badly to move , had been finished off before our eyes by the advancing Federals . We still had Jim Bledsoe and those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now we could no longer be slowed down by any wagons . We asked the farmer to look after them , butp196no sooner had we gone on than a bunch of Red Legs found them . The two recruits , whose christening ' was also the end of the war for them , pleaded for mercy , but Bledsoe chose to die like a man . According to the farmer , who was lucky enough to be spared by the Red Legs , he shouted : Stop it ! We are not entitled to mercy ! We spare none and do not expect to be spared ! ' The Red Legs killed all three of them , and an Indian tracker who was with them scalped the three corpses . We also lost a few more whose horses had given out on them or become sick from drinking too much water . Quantrill 's main force drew most of the pursuing Federals , and we hoped that our comrades who had been set afoot and who were hiding out in the timber and brush along the Grand would be overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoured the area and caught a number of them . They always killed them on the spot and usually any farmer who 'd been sheltering them . Some they hung , stringing them up from branches so high they could n't be reached , and their bodies just stayed there rotting for months . I knew a couple of men who died that way , and I was glad I never saw them hanging up . It was bad enough just seeing them in my mind 's eye , imagining how they looked after a while . " Having relived the Lawrence raid and his own part in it , the hardened outlaw John Ringo actually shudders . Twenty years earlier , in the weeks that followed the raid , the shame and revulsion of young John Ringgold had caused more than a shudder . He had writhed in the grip of nightmares in which he saw himself again as what he had become riding into Lawrence  --  more a demon than a man , possessed by a spirit of vengeance that admitted no pity . And not the least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had committed himself to this vengeful atrocity would have been horrified by it . If what she 'd promised him was true , then she had in fact been there with him , watching and weeping for those people , Red Legs and all . And how she must have wept to see what her " Johnny " had become . Which would have explained why during some of his most horrifying nightmares , when he saw the faces of some of the victims and smelled burning flesh in the ruins of Lawrence , he seemed to hear her voice urging him to leave Quantrill 's band before it was too late . Finally , in the late summer of ' sixty-four , he did leave Quantrill . He and Cole left together , but not before they 'd participated in actions that made them both capable of seeing themselves again as soldiers and not just marauding white savages who used the war as an excuse . Baxter Springs andp197Fayette were the most memorable of these actions . One of them , Baxter Springs , was a great triumph for Quantrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it a sweeter victory . Fayette , however , was another matter . Ringo still carries a souvenir of Fayette lodged in his thigh , and there his good horse Blaze had been shot from under him . There had been no victory for the guerrillas in that place . The reckless daring of George Todd , which had been partly responsible for the victory at Baxter Springs , where he had ordered a charge without awaiting Quantrill 's orders , had been their undoing at Fayette . The town was heavily garrisoned , and Todd led a charge against a log blockhouse that cost them thirteen good men killed and thirty more wounded , including John Ringgold . The wound , which nearly cost him his leg , made him listen more attentively to the voice inside warning him to leave while he was still able . He listened as well , he and Cole , to Bill Gregg , who , with the encouragementof Quantrill himself , had decided to leave the guerrilla band . " ' The colonel hisself admitted it . Todd 's running things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitches who do n't give a damn for the Confederacy . It 's the regular army for me . ' " Cole and I looked at each other , and it was apparent that we were both thinking that Gregg had spoken for us . Like him , we went to Quantrill , and he gave us the same encouragement . " ' You boys can no longer do anything for the Confederacy with this outfit . You 'd best go on to Texas and join General McCulloch , ' he told us . " ' What about you , colonel ? ' Cole asked him . " ' I 'll do what I can . George and I no longer see eye-to-eye on how to fight this war , but the men are absolutely devoted to him . I ca n't cross him . ' Then he shook hands with both of us . ' You 've both been good soldiers , good southern men . ' " It was one of those moments when you could see the man Quantrill and how he aroused the loyalty and affection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could work you into a blood frenzy . Actually , compared to Todd , Quantrill was almost a civilized officer . George was becoming more and more reckless and vicious , even in his dealings with his own comrades . The main reason Gregg left the band was the antagonism between him and ' I del , and right after Gregg left , Todd tried to get Fletch Taylor to kill him . Fletch , who was not known for his reluctance to shed blood , refused . At Fayette , Quantrill had tried to talk George out of leading us in that crazy charge against the blockhouse and George accused him of cowardice . Whenp198the Federals shot us to pieces and the charge failed , Todd blamed Quantrill and tried to order some of the men to kill him . They refused , but it was clearly the end for Quantrill as leader of the outfit . " General McCulloch was glad to have us , and with our experience he gave us both officer 's commissions . Cole was a major , and I was a captain . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time we were chasing Comanches and Confederate deserters . We were under the illusion that we knew everything there was to know about guerrilla warfare , but those Indians taught us plenty . " By now , we realized just how decisive Gettysburg and some of those other big battles in the East had been . We knew that the Confederacy was dying , but General McCulloch was one of those who had a hard time accepting the facts . Toward the end of ' sixty-four he sent Cole and me with a recruiting expedition to New Mexico . We were supposed to recruit a whole regiment for the Confederate army , and we tried our best . But Glorieta Pass in ' sixty-two really was the end of the war for that territory . Most of the men capable of fighting had long since gone east to join one side or the other . We finally gave up and drifted over into Arizona , where , because of the Apache threat , we did n't linger . We went on down into Mexico , where we ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern armies who were down there hoping to make their fortunes fighting either for or against the occupying French forces . Cole and I did n't figure there was much to be gained fighting for either side , so we took ship at Vera Cruz for San Francisco and when the war ended we were with Cole 's uncle , who lived near San Jose . ' After that , we returned to Missouri , and Cole tried to start a farm near Lee 's Summit . But most of his neighbors were Unionists who were unwilling to let the war be over . They tried to charge him and his brothers with murder for some of the people killed by Quantrill 's Raiders during the war , and they also tried to blame him for various holdups in the area . I knew that he was innocent , but who would believe another ex-guerrilla ? We left Missouri and went down into Louisiana , and I was there when Cole and another man shot it out after a horse race at Shreveport . He had so damn much reckless courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol . He was lucky the other fellow could n't shoot any straighter . " The last time I saw Cole was while he was living with Belle Starr down in the Nations . He was starting to get fat and his hair was falling out , but honest ranching seemed to agree with him . I was surprised to hear that he was actually pretty restless . " ' I just heard from Jesse , ' he said . ' You remember our cousin Jesse ,  |p199who  joined up with Anderson and Todd about the time we quit and joined the regulars ? ' " ' Yeah , I remember . He was wounded and we took him to his mother 's place . ' " ' That 's him . Anyway , I just got word from him . He wants me to round up Jim and Bob and join him for what he calls " some work on the railroad . " I think I know what he means . ' " ' I think I do too , ' I said . ' What does Belle think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big handsome woman bred on the prairies , used to strong men who took their chances , she seemed to belong with Cole . She overheard my question , and as she filled my coffee cup , she said , ' Cole 's got to do what 's right for him . The Yankees and the Pinkertons would n't leave us alone in Missouri . ' " ' What about you , John ? ' Cole asked me . ' Why do n't you join us ? I know Jesse 'd be happy to have you . The way we figure it we 're still fighting the war . The railroads and banks are all Yankee-owned , and they 're making it hard for our people . We 're going to strike back . ' " ' Well , I wish you luck , ' I answered . ' The war ended for me a long time ago . I 've made my peace with the Yankees , whether they want to honor it or not . ' " He understood , probably understood that it had ended for me after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to link up with Jesse , and that was the last I saw of him . "  |p200He  remembers how in the spring of ' sixty-nine , without really thinking about why , he began to drift south toward Texas . Crossing the Canadian River and then the Red and then the Trinity , he felt himself being drawn further and further south toward the home he had left nine years before . At first he had no intention of riding all the way to San Antonio and seeing his family again . It was as though the experience of the war had set the mark of Cain upon him and he had to wander forever toward the land of Nod . When he thought about it , he was actually afraid to see his family again , afraid that they would see the mark upon him . He remembered the time of innocence and hope when they had seen him off for Missouri , and little Mary 's words as she gave him a final hug : " I 'm so proud that you 're going to be a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're so happy for you . "  |p201It  was Mary 's words that were drawing him home again , he realized , the words she had written . A letter for him care of Ida Mae Younger had finally caught up with him during his visit with Cole and Belle . He still carries it , can remember it almost word for word . " Dearest Brother , " it began , " we have never stopped hoping you would come home to us . Ida Mae wrote to us about how you and her brothers went off to fight the Yankees after their father was killed . She said that you were wounded twice but that you are all right now . We thank God for it . Clayton went off to the war too , he and a lot of boys from around here went east with General Hood . Most of them did n't come back , and I must tell you that Clayton lost one of his arms at a place called Antietam . He 's so brave . He could have left the army then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back here he learned to take care of the farm again just as if he had two good arms . He 's married now to a wonderful girl whose husband was in his regiment and was killed in Tennessee . She had a son , and now she and Clayton have a daughter . You have a beautiful little niece , Johnny . You must come and see her . She 's the image of Mama . " Johnny , I must also tell you that when you come , Mama wo n't be here . We lost her two years ago . She was crossing the Medina in a buggy with Brother Mitchell , and some water splashed on her . She caught a chill and it turned into lung fever . I 'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this . I just wish that you could have come home after the war was over . It would have meant ever so much to Mama to see you again . Do n't misunderstand me , Johnny . I 'm not blaming you for anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coming home , but we 've all missed you so much . Please come now if you can . Always your loving sister , Mary . " Finally , one afternoon in early April he topped out on a low ridge that overlooked the Ringgold farm . A man was plowing in the lower field by the creek . Even at a distance he could tell that the man was well above average stature . There was something curious about the way he was plowing , and after a minute or so John made out that he had only one arm . He had himself strapped to the plow in such a way that he could manage it with his single arm , but obviously it was a feat beyond the strength of an ordinary man . Only someone like Clayton , who had more strength in one arm than most men had in two , could keep a straight furrow with that handicap . RememberingMary 's letter and deeply moved by the sight of Clayton struggling with the soil and his handicap , John dismounted and watched him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a woman come out into the field carrying a pitcher . With her was a tiny figure in a dress matching her own . Slowly the woman trussed the plowed field , leading the little girl by the hand . Claytonp202embraced the woman with his one arm and then stooped to lift his daughter . After the woman and her daughter returned to the house , John noticed a young boy walking along the deep muddy ruts of the road from town . Over his shoulder he bore a satchel , and since he entered the farmhouse it was n't hard to guess that he was Clayton 's stepson home from school . The farm had never looked so lovely to him . House and barn were both freshly painted , and beneath the windows of the house , with their bright blue shutters , were flower boxes . The surrounding fields , watered by abundant spring rains , were bright green , as green as Missouri , and there were swatches of wild flowers  --  poppies , lupines , daisies , paintbrush . Along the creek , the cottonwoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He supposed that it had always been this lovely in the spring , but as a youngster longing to escape confinement here , he had seen none of its beauty . He finally swung onto his horse and rode down to where Clayton was plowing . The fear of being " discovered " was still with him , but as he felt his brother crushing him in a one-armed embrace , his yearning to be with his family again overcame every other feeling . " My God , big brother , where have you been ? " " More places than I care to remember , Clayton , " he said , nearly choking . " Mary said you 'd be back , but we did n't believe her . You never wrote us . " " I know , Clayton . During the war I could n't , and after that I just did n't . But I wo n't stop writing again , believe me . " " It do n't matter , big brother . You 're here now , and you ai n't leavin ' us again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton unharnessed himself from the plow and led his brother across the plowed field to the house . On the porch they were met by a small pretty woman with eyes as blue as the cloudless sky above them and a piled-up mass of hair as bright gold as a halo . Clinging to her skirts was a little girl of four or five who , with her combed-out burnished auburn locks and big inquisitive green eyes , was a miniature of Judith Ringgold . Mary had n't exaggerated the resemblance . " You 're Johnny , " the girl 's mother said , before Clayton , slow-spoken as always , even had a chance to introduce them . " Clayton and your sisters have never stopped talking about you . Welcome home . " She gave him her hand and smiled warmly . " I 'm Linda . " She addressed the little girl beside her . " Judith , this is your Uncle Johnny . "  |p203As  he dropped to his heels on the porch step , so that he and she could look at each other eye-to-eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the very young encountering strangers . John Ringgoldwas filled with an almost unbearable warm sensation and just barely managed to resist the impulse to take the child in his arms . First he would teach her to smile at him , however long it took , then he would take her hand , and if she reached out to him after that , he would lift her in his arms . It did n't take long for the little girl to warm up to her uncle . During the days that followed , as he worked at various chores to make things easier for his brother  --  clearing an irrigation ditch from the creek , mending harness , replacing fence posts  --  she was constantly nearby , watching him , chattering endlessly about the activities of all the creatures on the farm around her , from her pet turtle , Frank , to an expecting mother cat and the milk cows . " You want one of Melissa 's kittens , do n't you , Johnny ? " She never called him " uncle . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of it . I 'll be leaving here soon . You 'll have to take care of it for me . " " Why do you have to leave ? Daddy wants you to stay , I know he does , and Mama too . " " I wish I could stay , Judith , " he told her truthfully . Just being with his brother 's family gave him a happiness he had not known since his long visits with the Youngers before the war . Watching them together , seeing how Linda 's son accepted Clayton as a father and how little Judith clung to him , and the loving way Linda had even when she was teasing her husband or was cross with him , John wondered if he would ever have a family of his own . For now , he derived the fullest pleasure out of being an uncle . He built a swing seat for Judith with a back and armrests and suspended it from the oak branch upon which he and Clayton had climbed as boys . When he had to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the little girl on the saddle in front of him . In the evenings , when she was asleep , he worked on a rocking horse , planning to have it ready for her birthday . His sister Mary was , like him , unmarried . She taught school in San Antonio , and he visited her frequently during the weeks he lived at the farm . At the end of the third week she told him about someone whom he 'd never forgotten . " I saw Lucy Conover the other day , " she announced casually , shifting the conversation . " Someone told her you were back . "  | " Someone ? " he said , grinning wryly at his little sister . " Not me , Johnny , " she answered emphatically , blushing a little as she did . " How is she ? " " Not very happy , if you want to know the truth . I do n't think she ever has been with Pace Conover . " " How do you know ? " he asked , trying to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A woman knows , " Mary answered cryptically , and he was hardly surprised , remembering . " She has a son . I wrote you about that . He 's nine now . As a matter of fact , he 's my best younger pupil . " Brother and sister regarded each other thoughtfully for a moment , and neither spoke . How much Mary knew , how much she guessed , he could only wonder . As one well schooled in suffering , who had come to know the wisdom of avoiding unnecessary pain , John resolved to avoid Mrs. Conover while he was in San Antonio . But this did not prevent him from meeting his sister the following day at the schoolhouse and watching her pupils , who ranged in age from eight to eighteen , run out at the sound of the dismissal bell . It happened that Mary 's star pupil emerged last , assisting the teacher with a great pile of books and papers . Seeing her brother there , Mary looked startled at first , but then she smiled at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sympathetic . She introduced the boy . " This is Johnny Conover . Johnny , this is my brother , Mr. Ringgold . " The boy managed to free his right hand from the pile of books , and John gripped it , looking into the frank , innocent blue eyes and feeling more strangely moved than he had ever felt before . " Pleased to meet you , sir , " he said . He was a chunky youngster , but one could see that he was the kind who would stretch out and shoot up to six foot or more when he hit his teens . " Johnny . " Hearing the name they shared , both the man and the nineyear-oldboy turned at the sound of another woman 's voice . " Hello , Lucy , " he said , removing his hat . She did n't return his greeting for a moment or two , and he thought that he could see sparks of anger in her violet eyes . She was smiling , but there was little warmth in her smile . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to stay or just visiting ? " " Just a visit . I 'll be leaving shortly , " he said , forcing a smile . That ought to relieve her , he thought . Even though her place in his heart had been taken by Margaret , he could n't help being stirred by the memory of what hep205had been led to believe was her love . He could n't help wishing that she had lost some of her beauty . Regrettably , he could see that she had lost nothing with the passage of nine years . " You must come and see us before you go , " she said , the angry bitter light in her eyes suddenly covered by an assumed veil of cordiality . " I 'll surely do that , " he answered , with as little intention of accepting the invitation as she had presumably intended he have . All the while they were both being watched by Mary , who missed nothing , and Lucy 's son , who seemed to miss a good deal less than most youngsters his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one-time lovers lost no time in bidding each other good-bye . That evening , as he rode back to the farm , John decided to leave without delay . He could finish Judith 's rocking horse if he worked on it all of the following day . She would be terribly disappointed not to have him there for her birthday , but at least the rocking horse would be there . Most of his thoughts were directed toward another child . The sight of Lucy 's son and the things Mary had told him about the boy had stirred feelings of pride but also a painful longing for what he knew he could not have . Surely the life of peace , blessed with a wife and children to care for , enjoying their love and the warmth of a home they had built together , was the life for a man . What a fool Cole was to leave Belle and go off with Cousin Jesse . Even Pace Conover was to be envied , in spite of what Mary said about the unhappiness of his wife . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether or not the boy was his in fact hardly mattered . The important thing was that Conover was able to raise him as a son . He had Conover 's name . Feeling utterly wretched in his envy , wondering if he could ever be anything but a homeless drifter himself , he arrived at his brother 's farm . He was surprised to find Linda on the porch waiting for him . She had a piece of paper in her hand . " Johnny , this is a message for you . That Negress who works for Lucy Conover brought it . " He thanked Linda and slipped the message into a coat pocket without reading it , afraid of what this good woman , his sister-in-law , might read in his face if the message said what he guessed it might say . " I used to work for Mrs. Conover 's father , " he said by way of explanation . She asked me to call on her and her husband . " Linda smiled and nodded , accepting the explanation but still looking a little puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led his horse into the barn . Before unsaddling he took out the message . Though he had indeed guessed what itsp206contents might be , he was still not a little surprised : MEET ME AT THESPRING . TOMORROW NOON . After a troubled night and an anxious morning , he found himself riding toward the spring , trying to rehearse what he would say , even as he had tried nine years before to prepare himself to tell her he was leaving for Missouri . She had surprised him then , and it was a long time before he figured out , with a little help from sister Mary , the reasons for her strange behavior . Now he was older and harder to surprise . He was also in love with the memory of another woman . He was older , wiser and therefore , he told himself , less vulnerable . When he arrived at the spring she was waiting , apparently had been for quite some time , though he was not late . She rose from her seat on the rock and came over as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance or design , she was dressed as he remembered her from their last meeting here . The brown leather riding skirt and the lace-fronted blouse , even the blue silk neckerchief , were the same . Did she remember what she was wearing ? Did she want him to remember ? Having secured his horse , he greeted her with cool , deliberate cordiality . " Hello , Lucy . " Then he added , unnecessarily , " I got your message . " " Did you , Johnny ? " she replied , confronting him and looking up into his face , perhaps searching to see what changes nine years had wrought in him . He reflected fleetingly that she was perhaps the only person whose discovery of the mark upon or within him he did not fear . She was the one who had initiated him into a world of danger and forbidden joy with all its guilt , pain and fleshfast ecstasy . She had , he believed , borne his child . He could share anything with this woman , even as she had shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she blocked his speaking as she put her arms around his neck and began to kiss him , softly at first but then greedily . His own hunger was more consuming than he knew himself , having been increased rather than satisfied by loveless chance encounters and nights in upstairs rooms . He returned her devouring kisses with an equal voracity , and whereas they had once derived much of their enjoyment of each other from sharing the spectacle of each other 's nakedness , they now took each other almost fully clothed , unable to endure a second 's delay . When they had been lovers before , he had become used to her crying out , and now she cried out again . But now he heard feelings he did not remember from before bitter grief and rage along with the joy of her lovingp207passion , elements at war within her that would not be quieted even after they had reached the summit of their pleasure . " Hold me , Johnny , " she whispered , clinging tightly to his neck and fighting to control a strange terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and stroked her very gently , and finally she managed to say : " I had to , Johnny . You know that , do n't you ? " " Had to what ? " " Had to marry him . You were leaving and I could n't ask you to stay . Do n't you understand ? " " Surely , I understand . " " Johnny is your son . " " I know , " he said , though hearing her say it added enormous weight to the fact . And made him all the more envious of the man who called himself the boy 's father . " Is Conover a good father ? " He had to know . " Yes , he is . He can give Johnny so much . And Johnny looks up to him , wants to be just like him . " As she said this , Lucy reached out to stroke his cheek , as though she knew she was inflicting pain . " He 's a good man , really he is , " she went on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to be a good wife . This is the first time I 've ever . . . Believe me , it is . " " I do , " he said , and then again , " I do . " And it 's wonderful . It 's so damned wonderful that I 'm begging you to leave here as soon as you can , for my sake , and Johnny 's . " " I will , Lucy . I promise , " he said , grateful for all she had given him but half wishing that he had n't come back to this place . He foresaw the lonely times to come , sitting beside a fire out on the Staked Plains or wherever , conjuring out of the smoke the remembered shape of her body , trying to remember how . . . " I mean , it would be so much worse if we were caught now . Pace must suspect , must know that Johnny is n't his , but he 's never let on that he does . He trusts me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave tomorrow . " " Good , " she said , smiling gratefully , and then : " Because if you stayed . . . " Instead of telling him , she showed him . There were no more tears that afternoon . They made love joyfully , guiltlessly , as though the passage of nine years had brought them innocence instead of experience , or that their experience enabled them to see how truly innocent they had been before.  |p208Thoughts  of Margaret came to him , but he did not feel disloyal . Lucy had been his teacher , and he was returning with her to the time of her gentle tutelage , before he even knew Margaret . He kept his word to Lucy , though it meant working most of the night on the rocking horse for Judith . He regretted that he was unable to paint it , but he was pleased with its sturdiness and the way it rocked . He finished it by attaching a saddle , bridle and reins cut out of an old pair of chaps . After that , it took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before milking time he was able to cat-foot out of the house without disturbing anyone . He knew that his brother would try to talk him out of leaving , and there was no way he could explain why he had to go . He had already said good-bye to Judith the previous evening , though the child had no way of knowing that was what he meant . " You were named after a great lady , Judith , " he had told her , as the two of them walked along the creek . " You 're going to grow up to be just like her , and your old uncle is going to be mighty proud . " " You 're my best uncle ! " the little girl burst out suddenly . " I 'm your only uncle , " he answered , laughing to hide what he felt . " I mean , you 're my best friend , " she said . At that , he dropped to his knees and took her in his arms , too moved to speak . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told himself . Someday he would be back here to see his niece . By then , probably , she would have grown into a lady like her grandmother . Until then , he would carry the image of her as she was now . As he rode away from his home into the darkness , he was thinking of all the people he loved who had to be left behind . If only he could justify staying a little longer . But he had given his word to Lucy , and her reasons for wanting him to leave were good ones . She was resolved to be what their son needed her to be , and if he cared for either of them , he would not be hanging around to undermine that resolve . What , after all , did he have to offer besides the kind of ephemeral pleasure they had enjoyed that afternoon ? Pace Conover was ap209man of substance . He could , as Lucy said , give the boy so much . The boy must never know that his real father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war . So he touched the flanks of his horse with his spurs and put a few miles between himself and home before sunup . He rode north , toward Burnet County , where he 'd heard that some big cattle spreads were hiring . When he arrived in Burnet , he took a hotel room . He also paid for a night upstairs with a crib girl at a nearby saloon . The following night , with his money about run out , he got into a poker game down in the saloon . One of the other players was the mayor of Burnet , Charlie McNichols . McNichols was a reading man , and he expressed his pleasure at winning a hand by quoting a line out of Horace , a poem to Fortune . " When I responded by quoting the next line of the poem  --  te . temper anteit saeva Necessitas  --  he damn near fell out of his chair . It came out that the town needed a schoolteacher . The job did n't pay much and the hours were long , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punching cows . So I took the job and taught school for six years , perhaps the quietest but most fulfilling six years of my life . Tutoring Andy Hockensmith had n't given me a lot of faith in my ability to impart learning , but these youngsters were different  --  fun-loving , obstreperous but educable . " Ringo smiles to himself , remembering some of his favorite pupils , wondering how they 'd made out in the grown-up world . Sammy Fergus , for instance . A gap-toothed , freckled sixteen-year-old with a bright red bush of hair , Sammy was the likeliest pupil in the school . And Lisa Childs , a dark , fragile , pretty girl , also sixteen . While the other youngsters were content to master the basic arithmetic they 'd need to keep track of stock or buy supplies , Sammy and Lisa wanted more , and the teacher sent away for algebra and geometry texts to tutor them . Because he took an interest in them , the two shared their aspirations with their teacher . ' A doctor , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sammy told him . " You need to go to a medical college , Sammy . " " I know that , Mr. Ringgold . But there 's nothing going to stop me . " Nothing except a nearly illiterate rancher-father who was determined to raise the boy in his own image . The teacher rode out to visit Mr. Fergusone afternoon and tried to reason him out of his opposition . " Why 'd you put that idea in his head , teacher ? " " It 's not my idea . It 's your boy 's own ambition . He 's got what it takes make something of himself : Maybe a doctor , maybe something else.  |p210Whatever  it is , he 's going to need more schooling than I can give him . " " I do n't agree , teacher , " Mr. Fergus replied , planting a gobbet of tobacco juice less than a foot from the teacher 's boot toe . " This place is going to be partly his someday , and what he needs to know about running it I 'll teach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife listened with interest . She started to invite the teacher in for coffee , but her husband cut her off , snapping , " Anything else we can do for you , teacher ? " Shortly after that , Mr. Fergus took his son out of school . Occasionally the boy managed to sneak away from the ranch and visit his old teacher , who , goaded by the memory of his own thwarted ambition , loaned him books and tried to encourage him not to regard his situation as hopeless . " Mama 's working on him , but that wo n't change his mind , " the boy told him bitterly . " I guess I 'll just have to light out of here when I get old enough . " " You do that , Sammy , just as soon as you 're ready . " " Ready , " they both knew , meant when somebody gave the boy enough money to leave home for further schooling . The teacher would have given him the money himself , if he 'd had it . Not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie McNichols , and Doc Quinn to help the boy . Still , Mr. Fergus remained unalterably opposed , but he was suddenly removed as an obstacle one day when his horse was startled by a diamondback and threw him practically on top of the reptile . There 's not much even a doctor can do for a rattlesnake bite in the neck . The ownership of the Fergus ranch passed to Widow Fergus and Sammy 's older brother , while Sammy went east to Baltimore for schooling . As for Lisa Childs , Ringo guesses that she probably became a teacher , probably in a little school like the one in which he taught her . " I want to teach the way you do , Mr. Ringgold , " she told him . " You make us all want to learn as much as we can . " Which was gratifying to hear even if he guessed that she spoke mainly for herself and Sammy Fergus . It was enough that she spoke for them . She had other aspirations as well , which she shared with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Books of poetry and stories and maybe even novels . " " Do n't put off your writing , Lisa . Start now . " He encouraged her because she had impressed him with her word handling in the compositions he assigned . " I already have , " she confided , shyly dropping her eyes as she brought out a sheaf of papers she had been concealing behind her back . " These arep211some poems I wrote and a story . They 're not very good , I 'm afraid , but I want you to see them because I know you can help me . You will help me , wo n't you , Mr. Ringgold ? " " Surely , " he said with a sympathetic smile . He took her pieces and read them carefully , and though he was no poet himself he had read enough poetry to be able to see that there was some real talent manifesting itself , embryonically as it were , in her self-conscious verses with their forced rhymes and overelaborated figures ( " like an eager butterfly in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The story was a cleverly contrived romance in an imagined Arthurian setting wherein a young maiden waited for a tall , auburn-haired knight to rescue her from a cruel magician with Saracens and demons at his command . As he read the story with a good deal more pleasure than he 'd anticipated , the teacher chuckled over the resemblance of the knight to himself . Sensing an infatuation that could be painful to the girl , he resolved to keep her at a distance , even while he encouraged her with her writing . He had no way of knowing that the distance between them would soon be reduced by the girl 's own mother . Shortly after he began reading the girl 's poetry , she brought him an invitation to have supper with them . Mrs. Childs was a widow in her mid-thirties whose husband had died at Vicksburg fighting for the North . She ran the only dress shop in Burnet , and John Ringgold had noticed her occasionally on Sunday mornings on her way to church escorted by a portly but handsome and prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious resemblance she bore to his own mother . The resemblance was not a matter of anything physical they had in common . Indeed they were very different physical types , though equally striking , Lisa 's mother being very tall and imposing with dark eyes and gleaming black hair pulled back severely into a bun . But like his mother , Mrs. Childs bore herself in an erect , queenly manner that conveyed to the beholder a kind of self-assured spirituality that could be intimidating . John was a little apprehensive about meeting her . As it happened , Mrs. Childs was a most gracious hostess , and John soon felt totally at ease with her . " Mr. McNichols tells me you 're a man of learning , Mr. Ringgold . I think that 's a fine thing . We 're fortunate to have you here in Burnet teaching our children . " " Mighty kind of Mr. Mr Nichols to say that , " John replied . " I guess he does n't run into that many people out here who read Latin poetry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . He attendedp212Harvard College but did n't finish because of the war . " John told her a little about his own interrupted education and admitted that he 'd fought for the South . " Most men from around here did , " she said . " It hardly seems to matter now , does it ? " " It does to some . What brought you out here ? " he asked , for she was obviously not a native of this region . He guessed that she was from somewhere in the neighborhood of Harvard College . " My mother 's family is Spanish . They owned property here from an old land grant . I came out here to sell it and decided to stay . " " Mr. Ringgold 's helping me with my poetry , " Lisa broke in . ' And he 's going to teach me how to read Latin and maybe Greek . " Mrs. Childs responded with a nod and a grateful smile that warmed the teacher but also caused him to flush a little with embarrassment . " Lisa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . For some reason , the girl looked upset and nervous , in spite of the fact that he and her mother were getting on well . Barely speaking , she served the supper her mother had prepared , a simple meal but with a touch of elegance that reminded him of suppers with the Youngers before the war . After Lisa cleared the table and excused herself , Mrs. Childs went to the sideboard and brought out a bottle of whiskey . " One ca n't purchase good brandy or port out here , I 'm afraid . " She poured him a generous shot in a cut-glass tumbler but poured herself a cup of tea . " This is just fine . To you , Mrs. Childs , " he said , raising the glass . " You can call me Grace . " " If you 'll call me John . " Lisa came in then to say good-night . She had some papers in her hand , which she held out to him . " These are the poems you read . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John rose to his feet and thanked her , for the poems and the supper she had helped her mother prepare . The girl smiled brightly as she said goodnightbut seemed to be covering something . After she left the room and was well out of earshot , the mother smiled at him knowingly and said , " She adores you . " " She 's a fine girl , " he replied , a little stiffly . " Makes it easy to be a teacher when somebody 's that willing to learn . " " She 's just sixteen . That 's a hard age for a girl ...  | " For anybody , " he answered , remembering his own bittersweet initiationby Lucy McMaster . " Folks say you 're the best teacher we 've ever had here in Burnet . Did you know that ? " " No , I did n't , " he answered , flushing . " The school board has heard about you . They 're going to ask you to be county inspector of schools . That 's what Mr. McNichols told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a shame to take you out of the schoolroom , but he said that you could do more good helping other teachers , and besides the job will pay you a lot more . " " The pay does n't matter that much , " he replied honestly . " Nobody teaches school for the money you earn . " He did n't mention how he supplementedhis meager teacher 's income with weekly trips over to Lampasas , where he dealt faro and poker . " But the laborer is worthy of his hire , " she answered him , as his mother might have , with just the right biblical text . The evening was the beginning of a relationship that might have changed his life altogether if it had n't been for subsequent events and some choices that might , perhaps , have been made differently . " Grace , " Ringo whispers softly to himself " ' When once we have forgot our Grace , we would and we would not . ' " What might he have done if things had turned out differently ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than he was , attractive , warm , intelligent and good , the perfect wife for the upstanding pillar of the community he was becoming John Ringgold , Inspector of Schools . When he began to call on her in the evenings , to drive her out in the country for picnics and to escort her to church  --  in a word , to court her  --  the girl Lisa reacted by overcoming her infatuation and regarding him as , in her mother 's words , " the father she never had . " He cared deeply for both of them . Did he love Grace Childs ? Maybe . There were different ways to love a woman . What he felt for Grace was nothing like what he had felt for Margaret or Lucy , but it was a kind of love . He could have done much worse . And did . " I had made a number of friends around Burnet , including the Beard brothers , Mose and John , with whom I lived for a time . Their mother was a kind lady who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches for me with various young women in the neighborhood . She did n't abandon that project until I started squiring Grace around and she saw us together in church , "  | " She 's a fine woman , John , " Mrs. Beard said . " Just the kind you need . Her friends are mighty glad that she 's fancying you instead of that lawyer fellow . " " He 'd make her a lot richer , " John said with a rueful chuckle . But he 's not the sure-enough man you are , John . You 'll take care of her and make her happy . " Sadly , Ringo remembers Mrs. Beard 's kind words and how they had supported him in his resolve to settle down to a peaceful career , married to a good woman . If only Mrs. Beard had been able to exert a comparable pacifying influence on her own sons . . . . Along about the end of ' seventy-five Mose and John threw in with a fellow named Scott Cooley , who had assembled a gang over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stepfather , a Mr. Williamson . His stepfather , it seems , had been murdered by one of the German settlers , a man named Pete Bader , over in Mason County with the connivance of a deputy sheriff by the name of Wohrle . Cooley 's stepfather had been suspected of rustling , and that killing was typical of the way the Germans in that county were taking the law into their own hands . " This Cooley was a strange one . His real parents had been massacred by Indians up in Palo Pinto County and he was carried off by them . After he was rescued , the Williamsons adopted him and brought him up . He was short and stocky and so dark that he looked part Indian , but you never met a man who hated Indians the way Cooley did . I remember hearing how he was run out of a saddle shop when he brought in some strips of hide that had a lot of tallow on them which he wanted to be braided into a quirt but which turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days the best place for a man with an appetite for Indian killing was the Texas Rangers , and Cooley was for a while a ranger . At the time of his stepfather 's murder , however , he had settled down farming near Menardville . If it had n't been for the Beards , I never would have met him , and if Mose had n't gotten himself killed , I certainly would n't have thrown in with the Cooley gang . I 'd had enough fighting during the war to last me more than a lifetime . The quiet life of a school inspector was starting to agree with me , and I was just about to ask Grace Childs to be my wife . " He remembers a quiet summer afternoon , one of many , when he and Mrs. Beard were sitting together in her kitchen drinking coffee . He had just told her of his decision to ask for Grace 's hand and she had just responded delightedly , " Well , it 's about time , I 'd say ! " when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p215The  news of her son 's death nearly killed Mrs. Beard . While two neighbor women looked after her , and Doctor Quinn was sent for , the surviving Beard brother related the particulars of Mose 's death to his friend John Ringgold : " There was near sixty of ' em waitin ' . When Mose an ' a fella called Walker started to cross the stream , they was surrounded . I guess Mose said somethin ' an ' all of a sudden them Germans cut loose . Mose an ' Walker was shot to pieces . That 's how it was told to us by one of the Germans who was there an ' who did n't hold with them sixty-t ' - two odds . He also told us the Mason County sheriff an ' his deputy was there with them squareheads lookin ' on all the while . " So there was no looking to the law for a prosecution . John Ringgold told John Beard that he would be returning to Mason County with him . " Naw , thanks anyway . We do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolteacher , " he snapped in reply . Without elaborating , he told Beard to wait for him . Then he went up to his room and hunted out a pair of saddlebags he had n't used for over six years . Inside one , carefully wrapped in flannel rags , were two Navy Colts . In the other was a pair of holsters . Buckling them on , he had the sense of one about to take an irretraceable step . He knew full well that a man who buckles on a gun for use in this kind of affair may be choosing never to be without one again . But he could hear the sound of Mrs. Beard 's weeping from the other end of the house , and he did n't hesitate . " We rode on over to Mason County , and during the weeks that followed , we had our share of fights with the Dutch , ' as we called them . Since most of the Germans had fought for the Union and most of us Americans , ' as Cooley 's gang started calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuation of the war . " For John himself , it was not only a continuation , a return to the war , but a rediscovery of something he had intended , hoped , to leave caged within the bars of his newfound respectability . As a dedicated educator and a family man , one who would be worthy of Grace Childs , he could , so he believed , confine the creature that the war had let out . Remembering , though , remembering the long trail from Mason County to Tombstone , John Ringo , outlaw , sadly doubts that it would have borne confinement long . For now he remembers how , in spite of being confined and well-nigh forgotten during his peaceful years in Burnet , it sprang out of him , indeed became him in his first encounter with the Germans of Mason County . Elder Creek . That was where they found " the Dutch " late
