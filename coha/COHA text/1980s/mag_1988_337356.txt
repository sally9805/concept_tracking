When mystery fans start swapping the names of favorite books and authors , they often sound as though they are speaking of several conflicting genres . Devotees of locked-room puzzle stories may disdain the hard-boiled private-eye saga . The tea-sipping pleasures of naughtiness in a village can seem overrefined in comparison with the beer , blood and brawling in big-city police procedurals . Like the roving players in Hamlet , the authors of mystery fiction are prepared to entertain in veins lyrical , tragical , comical and historical and in moods from the slyly literary to the sociologically earnest . <P> Even the nomenclature is open to debate . Some " mysteries " contain no puzzle or enigma . In many modern " detective " stories there is no true detective . What the French call a roman policier may not actually include the police . The British surmount the problem by calling the genre crime fiction . Perhaps the crime story is like pornography in Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart 's oft-cited formulation : impossible to define but unmistakable in its effects . <P> Among those most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britons Peter Dickinson and Ruth Rendell . Each of Dickinson 's 16 mysteries has something unique and haunting at its heart , from Sleep and His Brother , set at a clinic for children doomed to compulsive somnolence and early death , to The Poison Oracle , centering on linguistic research among apes at a desert sultanate 's laboratory . Perfect Gallows ( Pantheon ; 234 pages ; $16.95 ) traces the psychic development of a world-class actor who through much of the narrative has barely set foot on a stage , yet feels absolutely certain of his craft and ultimate triumph . <P> The story bristles with shrewd ideas on topics as varied as how Shakespeare 's The Tempest ought to be played ( an amateur production is the fulcrum of the plot ) to the role of egalitarian wartime food rationing in dismantling the old British class structure . The budding artist coolly looks on everything  --  from his mother 's death during World War II bombing to his own accidental hastening of an aged relative 's demise  --  as mere material . His outlook could be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The confluence among those personalities is precisely Dickinson 's point and confers most of the book 's considerable suspense . Comparisons to Dostoyevsky are not out of order . <P> Rendell 's most recent work , Talking to Strange Men ( Pantheon ; 280 pages ; $16.95 ) , eerily recalls Lord of the Flies . Her schoolboys and - girls are not washed up on some island but housed in upper-middle-class comfort . Yet mentally they inhabit an unseen world where they play an elaborate game of spy and counterspy , conducted with high solemnity and utter ruthlessness . This emotional tinderbox is ignited when the espionage is discovered by an unstable outsider who believes he has found evidence of treason . Rendell 's trademark is to invert the classic adventure story : rather than transmute ordinary men into heroes , exceptional events crush them into madness .
