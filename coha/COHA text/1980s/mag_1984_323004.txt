After years of legal wrangling , the pace of executions quickens <P> One way or the other , it was bound to be Alpha Otis Stephens ' last night . First he tried killing himself , during his last lonely hours in a cell , by slashing at one wrist with a safety razor . He bled only a little . Then , just after midnight , the state of Georgia undertook to kill him . The 39-year-old murderer , looking scared , was strapped into the electric chair , electrodes fastened to his shaved head and shaved right leg . Superintendent Ralph Kemp counted to three , a volunteer executioner pushed a button , and 2,080 volts , 20 times the charge in a household socket , coursed through Stephens for two full minutes . <P> But when the electricity was shut off , the prisoner twitched . Then he gasped , and began breathing steadily . Stephens , although apparently unconscious , was not dead . According to Georgia execution procedure , five more minutes had to pass before a pair of prison doctors could examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution has not been completed , " said Kemp rather formally , " and will be reinstituted at this time . " The button was pushed again , Stephens stiffened and , at last , stopped moving at all . <P> These days it takes a botched or otherwise unusual execution to grab public attention . Executions have become so frequent they are usually relegated to a couple of column inches on the inside pages of morning newspapers . From the end of the de facto ten-year moratorium on capital punishment in 1977 through last year , only eleven Americans were put to death legally . Stephens ' execution last week , however , was the 20th this year . Not since 1963 have the states executed so many people . Next year the rate of executions seems sure to quicken , perhaps to one a week : by most reckonings , about 50 of the more than 1,400 inmates now on death row will be put to death . " There is no question that the system is gearing up , " says Richard Brody , director of the anti-death-penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if 50 people were executed next year , another 250 new convicts would probably take their place on death rows around the country . " <P> Thirty-nine states have death penalty statutes on the books , and opinion polls find an overwhelming majority of Americans in favor of such laws . But the debate continues over whether the death penalty discourages would-be killers and whether it can be meted out fairly . The deterrent effect has never been proved , and the preponderance of expert opinion is skeptical . In the absence of conclusive scientific evidence , the argument has turned more on morality than efficacy . Proponents claim that the death penalty is the only punishment that truly fits the crime of murder ; opponents insist that capital punishment is cruel , capriciously applied and unbecoming a civilized society . <P> Even some advocates of capital-punishment laws are uneasy about actually imposing the penalty . Oregon voters , who abolished the death penalty by referendum in 1964 , reimposed it the same way last month , but only in cases involving wanton murderers who would otherwise pose a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a tough new capital-punishment statute co-sponsored by State Senator Ray Powers . Even so , Powers declares , " we 're just not a death-penalty state like , say , Florida , and this law is n't going to make us one . "
