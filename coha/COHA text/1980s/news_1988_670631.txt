With the start of the maple sugaring season just a few weeks away , researchers at the University of Vermont in Burlington have begun an " Adopt-a-Maple Tree " program to raise money to build a new laboratory dedicated to researching maple trees. // The fund-raising effort comes in the wake of the destruction by fire of the 41-year-old Maple Research Center in Underhill , Vt. , operated by the university and described by Dr. Hubert W. Vogelmann , a university botanist , as " the only research facility of itskind in North America . " Ten days ago a fire destroyed the lab building , along with $250 , 000 worth of equipment and years of research. // The lab was established to study all aspects of maple trees , and to help maple sugar makers produce syrup more efficiently , said Dr. Vogelmann . Research has ranged from studying the effects of acid rain on maple trees to experiments in new ways of tapping trees to collect sap , Dr. Vogelmann said. // Dr. Melvin T. Tyree , director of the lab , said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on maple trees , and said the fire set his work back one to two years . He was not alone : Frederick Laing , the former director of the center who is now a professor emeritus , lost nearly 20 years of data , Dr. Tyree said. // Dr. Tyree said that state fire officials have told him that that the cause of the fire may never be known , but they speculated that a faulty wood stove might have been to blame . He said no damage was done to any of the maple trees on the 160-acre , former dairy farm upon which the lab was situated. // And he said he has been pleased with the " overwhelming show of support " from farmers , sugar makers , and others in helping to raise money to rebuild the lab . The university ' s goal is to build a larger and more modern laboratory than the one that burned , which Dr. Tyree said would take at least $400 , 000 more than what was covered by insurance. // The Adopt-a-Tree program is " a real way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the program , a person donating $25 will receive a certificate of adoption from the university and a map locating the adopted tree on the Underhill research farm . For $100 , Dr. Tyree said , the university will engrave a donor ' s name on a plaque to be hung on the tree . For $500 , he said , patrons names will appear on a plaque in the new laboratory. // With 20 , 000 maple trees on the site , Dr. Tyree said that there were " more than enough to go around " for those interested in adoption . <> <> Up in Arms Over Fonda // There are veterans in Massachusetts who still hold a grudge against Jane Fonda for traveling to Hanoi in the Vietnam War 16 years ago . When some veterans in Holyoke learned that she would be in here next summer to film a movie , they sponsored a resolution to let her know of their displeasure . Last month , the Board of Alderman passed the measure in an 11-to-4 vote. // " We can ' t stop her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Alderman John E. Welihan , who is a veteran. // Similar resolutions are scheduled to be taken up in two other Massachusetts towns , Chicopee and Beverley , March 7 and 9 . Last fall , veterans in Waterbury , Conn. , where much of the movie " Union Street " is to be filmed , ignited the current fuss with a bumper sticker campaign and letters to the editor of the local newspaper. // One Holyoke veteran who supported the aldermanic resolution is Clayton K. Hough Jr. who lost both legs in Vietnam . He said it was not just Ms. Fonda ' s trip that angered veterans , but what she said and did while there. // " She seemed to choose the other side : wearing their clothes , sitting behind anti-aircraft artillery , " he said . Since then , " We ' ve heard other people atone for her but we ' ve never heard her say she made a mistake. " // But others in Holyoke defend Ms. Fonda ' s right to visit their city . Joseph M. McGiverin , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We support the right of our veterans to protest and the right of Ms. Fonda to make a film here . We aren ' t going to throw out the red carpet but we aren ' t going to bar her either. " // Ms. Fonda could not be reached for comment . But a spokesman for her , Stephen M. Rivers said , " She thinks it was a mistake going to Hanoi and said that 10 years ago. " // Mr. Hough said " Holyoke veterans would like to hear Ms. Fonda speak for herself in the national media and maybe set up a scholarship fund with the revenue from some of these movies for kids of guys who died over there . " <> <> Technology To the Rescue // The crack in the Liberty Bell is a celebrated flaw , but cracks and a gaping hole in the glass pavilion that houses the bell are a different matter. // When a derelict threw a paving stone through one of the panels in the pavilion in December , officials of Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . The factory that manufactured the original panels , which measured 18 feet by 10 feet , informed park officials years ago that it could not reproduce additional ones because of the expense. // " We were told the last time we replaced the glass , ' Don ' t come back anymore , ' " said Hobart G. Cawood , superintendent of the park . " I was in a real dilemma. " // Apprised of the problem , the DuPont Company proposed sandwiching Butacite , the same polymer substance that prevents automobile windshields from shattering , between two half-inch thick sheets of glass . The Ingersoll-Rand Corporation and the Dlubak Studios of Pittsburgh volunteered their equipment and expertise to cut and bond three pieces of glass to look as one. // Installation of the new safety glass is scheduled to begin this week . The panel adjacent to the broken one also was to be replaced so that the tinted glass on the north side of the pavilion will be the same color. // The panels , which cost $25 , 000 each , will be donated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derelict , he initially told park officials that he broke the window after a park ranger poured out his wine . Faced with prosecution , he recanted and the charges were dropped. //
