A local coalition is seeking to persuade city officials to grant civilians a greater voice in investigating questionable shootings and in disciplining errant officers. // Richard A. Waples , legal director for the Indiana Civil Liberties Union , which is part of the coalition , said in a recent interview : " We ' ve got a situation here in Indianapolis that seems to be unreasonable . Police officers approach situations with a combat-type of attitude , and we feel they are too quick to use force. " // Some say the recent shootings show that the furor created by five fatal shootings in 1980 and the efforts by the police and community that were spawned then did not resolve the problems. // The case that prompted the most outrage then was that of Michael Smith , an unarmed black youth who was fleeing from the scene of a burglary , when he was shot . Since 1980 , 24 people , most of them black , have been shot dead by the police or sheriff ' s deputies. // In February of this year , Valenda L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mentally disturbed , was shot to death in the living room of her apartment by two Marion County sheriff ' s deputies. // In April , Officer Stacy L. Crowe of the Indianapolis Police Department shot a black man , Robert V. Logan , in the back while trying to handcuff him . <> <> Federal Efforts to Help // After the 1980 shootings the Justice Department ' s Community Relations Service intervened to try to improve rapport among the residents , city officials and the police , and the agency is involved again. // Pat Glenn , a senior conciliation specialist for the Community Relations Service , said black and Hispanic residents of Indianapolis had " a perception that excessive use of force by the police was a real problem. " // " Our agency ' s No. 1 priority is allegations of excessive use of force by police against minority communities , " Ms. Glenn said . " That ' s a national perception . It is not indigenous to Indianapolis. " // William H. Hudnut 3d , Mayor of the city of 483 , 000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Hudnut said in an interview , " Indianapolis has just had particularly bad incidents to happen here. " // The two incidents in Indianapolis this year have led to some changes in procedures for handling complaints of excessive force and put added emphasis on community relations efforts by the Sheriff ' s and Police Departments. // Mr. Hudnut has also reminded members of the Police Department that " just because a shooting may be legally justified because it is within the law , that doesn ' t necessarily mean that it is O.K. " <> <> Woman Called for Deputies // In the Heithecker case , according to official accounts , the woman had called the Marion County Sheriff ' s Department Feb. 11 complaining that bad odors were coming from her neighbors ' apartment and that she feared they had been murdered. // When the deputies , Michael R. Berry and Rex E. Thompson , arrived at her apartment , according to these accounts , she did not believe they were really sheriff ' s deputies , threatened them with a steak knife and slammed the door on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Southers , who they later said had told them to force their way into her apartment and arrest her on charges of threatening a law-enforcement officer. // The deputies pushed in the door . She continued to threaten them with the knife - they said she lunged at them - and the officers shot , according to the accounts . Eight bullets were fired into her. // That followed by just six months a similar incident in neighboring Hamilton County : A mentally disturbed white man , Michael Mathison , who had refused to go to a mental health clinic was shot by the police after a siege at his home . The police said he had a knife . His family has filed suit against the police. // " Those shootings outraged constituencies that I never heard from before , " Michael L. Gradison , executive director of the civil liberties union , which is helping in the suit , said of the Mathison and Heithecker shootings . He added : " A lot of that had to do with the fact that they both were white , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputies involved in the Heithecker shooting are awaiting a trial before the Sheriff ' s Department ' s merit board , which can find them guilty or not guilty of violating department rules or state laws and can determine punishment . Previously , the firearms review board , made up of members of the Sheriff ' s Department , found the deputies ' actions to be unjustified . Merit boards have been in place in the Police and Sheriff ' s Departments since the 1980 shootings. // In the April incident , Officer Crowe said the shooting was accidental , and a departmental investigation upheld her account . But she was later reassigned for further training on how to apprehend and handcuff suspects. // Police Chief Joseph A. McAtee said that in a survey of 30 cities similar in size to Indianapolis , the department found that Cleveland , with only about 80 , 000 more residents , had 183 cases in which the police fired guns in 1985 . Indianapolis had eight of these " police action shootings " in 1985 , including the three fatalities . By comparison Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> Community Leaders ' Efforts // After the Heithecker shooting , Mr. Gradison of the civil liberties union and Samuel H. Jones , president of the Indianapolis Urban League , formed the Indianapolis Law Enforcement-Community Relations Coalition to urge city and county officials to grant a civilian review board the power to investigate police shootings that result in deaths and to determine punishment. // Mayor Hudnut and others said civilians were sufficiently represented on grand juries , coroner ' s juries , and merit boards. // " We are open to discuss these things , but I must confess that there is a lot of feeling inside the Police Department that anything like that would become a kangaroo court , " the Mayor said. //
