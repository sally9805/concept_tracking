Mr. Koch , appearing unusually gloomy at a City Hall news conference , said he had ordered a 90-day freeze on hiring for 5 , 200 jobs , suspended a 5 percent pay raise for 4 , 000 management-level employees and withdrawn a $64 million contribution that the city had planned to enhance municipal pension benefits. // The Mayor said the collapse of the stock market and intensified fears of a recessionC which could reduce New York City ' s revenues , had prompted him to impose the measures. // If the economy and New York City ' s finances turn out to be better off than is now feared , the Mayor said , the city could resume its planned course. // " I am concerned for New York City , " Mr. Koch said at the news conference , which was attended by representatives of several municipal agencies eager for the details of his plans. // City services will suffer , the Mayor said . " Inevitably , these fiscal actions will have a negative effect on the delivery of city services , " he said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city tax revenues rely on personal income , business profits and real-estate values . Officials said they did not know how much revenue might be lost if there is an economic downturn. // Because of the retrenchment , the Koch administration ' s goal of reducing the average ambulance response time on life-threatening cases to eight minutes is being set aside , leaving the existing goal of 10 minutes . In addition , repairs to parks , streets and sewers are also being curtailed. // The retrenchment " will also affect our ability to meet targets we have set in other agencies , " Mr. Koch said . He predicted that the annual Mayor ' s Management Report in January will show the city falling short on several performance standards . " It ' s not going to be as good , " he said. // City officials had warned Monday that a municipal hiring freeze was being considered . <> <> Preparing for the Worst // Speaking in blunt language , Mr. Koch warned : " Even worse economic news may be just around the corner . The dramatic decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national and local economy . " He added , " Virtually no one predicted the stock market crash . No one can confidently say what will happen in the future . We may be at a turning point. " // Pre-emptive moves now can help New York City avoid more drastic measures , such as employee layoffs , in the future , Mr. Koch said . The risk of postponing action , he said , is that " by then it could be too late. " // " It keeps our options open while we assess the economy and our fiscal condition , " Mr. Koch said . " If the economy is sound and our revenue growth is strong , then we can resume our ambitious hiring plans , having suffered only a short delay . I ' d rather that , in 90 days , the critics say , ' He cried wolf . ' I ' d love it. " // He warned , however , that the temporary hiring freeze could become permanent . " There is a very real possibility that expenditure reductions and service reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Estimated Savings // Using a Biblical reference , Mr. Koch said , " It ' s like Joseph in Egypt . In a lean year , you ' ve got to prepare. " // Mr. Koch ' s reassessment of the city ' s finances for the next 90 days coincides with the preparation of his preliminary budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. // The cornerstone of the retrenchment is the hiring freeze . Budget officials estimated that it would save $14. 5 million by Feb. 1 , $83. 5 million if it is extended to the end of the fiscal year on June 30 , and $269 million if it is extended through June 30 , 1989. // " That ' s a lot of moolah , " Mr. Koch said. // The freeze applies generally to jobs that were to have been created for expanded services under the current prosperity-based budget , and also to vacancies resulting from retirements and resignations. // Certain jobs will be exempt from the freeze , including doctors and nurses at municipal hospitals , jail guards , firefighters , schoolteachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of new housing . <> <> Impact on Police // The biggest impact will be in the Police Department . The hiring of 484 civilians will be deferred , training for 1 , 938 police cadets , which was to begin Jan. 1 , will be postponed to Jan. 20 , and another class of 2 , 278 cadets will be delayed from June 1 to June 30. // Among the jobs that will not be filled are 66 nonteaching positions in the schools , 263 hospital jobs , 276 welfare agency jobs , 75 Health Department jobs , 80 civilian jobs in the jails , 35 fire administration jobs , 194 environmental protection jobs , 154 transportation jobs , 201 park jobs , 112 Department of Investigation jobs , 139 housing management jobs , 52 jobs in the economic development agency , 185 general services jobs , 33 Finance Department jobs and 30 jobs in the personnel office. // On the Mayor ' s own staff , hiring for 126 positions will be deferred. // In addition to cutting the city ' s payroll , the Koch administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perform city services under contracts with the Human Resources Administration. // The raises for management employees normally would have been announced after the city completed its contract negotiations with unionized workers , and probably would have been made retroactive to last July 1 , to match the union raises that took effect at the same time . That is still a possibility if the economy and the city ' s revenues are strong . The raises amount to about $11 million a year . <> <> Pension Compromise // The pension issue involves a $120 million plan that Mr. Koch persuaded Governor Cuomo to veto as too expensive . Mr. Koch had offered to come up with a more modest plan , and had proposed a $64 million contribution to increase pension benefits. // " Before the stock market crashed , " Mr. Koch said , " it was a reasonable compromise . " He said that he would revive the plan " if the economy remains robust. " // The move to withdraw the contribution requires the approval of the Legislature and Governor Cuomo. // Because of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970 ' s it is better equipped than most cities to respond to changing economic conditions , Mr. Koch said. //
