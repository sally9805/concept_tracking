On the road in China , Reagan hears about opportunities and obstacles <P> Philosophically , it had been a long march indeed for Ronald Reagan . Just five years ago , when full diplomatic relations were established with China and cut with Taiwan , Candidate Reagan sputtered angrily . He said he had just watched Washington " cold-bloodedly betray a friend for political expediency . The memory will not go away . " Maybe not , but it has obviously faded some . Reagan 's frothy six days in the country that he used to call " Red China , " is his presidency 's most important foreign trip by far . Speaking in the Great Hall of the People in Peking , he alluded to Richard Nixon 's epochal China trip twelve years ago . " I believe history beckons again , " he said . " We have begun to write a new chapter for peace and progress in our histories , with America and China going forward hand in hand . " <P> Reagan was interrupted by applause seven times in his 20-minute speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he discovered that Sino-American diplomacy can still be a very tricky affair . When China 's government television system broadcast the President 's Great Hall speech , 17 passages were judged provocative and excised ( see box ) . To be sure , the speech also demonstrated that while the President has largely reversed himself on China , his conservative rhetoric has lost none of its crackle . He called the Soviet Union " wanton " and " brutal , " and ascribed America 's success to liberty and godliness . Although the President and his party made light of Chinese TV 's bowdlerization of the speech ( said Reagan to reporters : " You fellows do it all the time " ) , the Americans were sore over the incident . <P> If neither side fully understands the other , the Reagan visit certified that U.S.Chinese relations have passed through the first surge of enthusiasm , with its high hopes of vast strategic cooperation , toward a mature stage marked by a sense of continuity and prudent limits . Just two years ago relations had deteriorated badly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative Carter Administration policymaker , " was one of neglect , ignorance and insensitivity . " Whatever problems may lie ahead , that benightedness now is gone . <P> Last weekend 's display of good will was more than just a matter of pomp and pandas . Reagan met for serious talks with each of China 's current leaders : de facto Ruler Deng Xiaoping , Premier Zhao Ziyang , Party Leader Hu Yaobang and President Li Xiannian . The Chinese mentioned Taiwan again and again , but in measured tones ; ultimatums were not delivered . Deng , while forswearing any explicit alliance with Washington , made it clear over the course of his 2 hours with Reagan on Saturday that he shares the American President 's fundamental distrust of the Soviets . Several trade agreements were firmed up . <P> Despite awkward moments here and there , the trip worked . Even the stern People 's Daily ran extraordinarily puffy coverage of Reagan day after day , and the 30-minute Chinese TV news devoted up to ten minutes a night to the capitalist leader .
