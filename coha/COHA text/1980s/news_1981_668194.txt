Harvard tried to cram all of its hockey into the last 10 minutes of play last night , but it didn ' t work . For the second straight evening , the Crimson fell to an Ivy League opponent at Bright Hockey Center . This time it was Princeton 3 , Harvard 2 . Harvard , which had dropped an 8-5 decision to Cornell on Friday , played a lackluster first two periods , falling behind , 3-0 , before mustering any offense at all . And when the Crimson failed to score while they had a two-man advantage for 1:44 early in the third period , there seemed to be little hope . But Harvard made the game interesting for the 1700 on hand , however . The Crimson closed to within a single goal when Dave Connors scored at 11:08 of the final period , and their freshman goalie , Mark Whiston of Ipswich , stopped a penalty shot by Princeton ' s Jim Matthews with 36 seconds left in the game . Harvard coach Bill Cleary had pulled Whiston in order to get a sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Crimson zone , and Alan Litchfield was called for throwing his stick at the puck while the goalie was out of the net . Whiston returned to the goal long enough to block Matthews ' shot with the glove on his stick hand . But despite those heroics , the Crimson could not connect the rest of the way . Two Ivy losses in as many nights had Cleary bordering on despondency . " We started too late again , " he said . " For the eighth game this year , we have had to play catchup . We ' ve been spotting the other guys goals too often . " It was Princeton ' s first Ivy win against two defeats . Harvard has only a single Ivy win , over Brown , against four losses . " And three of those losses have been by 3-2 scores , " Cleary pointed out . " And two Ivy losses in a row are really tough . " The Crimson are now 5-9 overall and have dropped seven of their last eight games - four of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They won that one , then got the puck into the Harvard zone and back to Rob Sherstobitoff at the point . One of nine Canadians skating for the Tigers , Sherstobitoff took a slapshot that found Weston ' s Jim Farrell camped at Whiston ' s right . He tipped the puck past the Harvard goalie at the 22-second mark . Princeton made it 2-0 at 9:56 on a similar play . Ray Casey won a faceoff in the Harvard zone and got the puck back to Terry Seaman at the point . Seaman launched a screamer that Grant Hansen directed home . Princeton went up by three on a power-play goal at 6:07 of the middle period when Sherstobitoff blasted one through a screen from the point . The Crimson finally broke through at the 12:07 mark of the second period when Greg Olson was allowed to skate along the left boards after getting the puck inside his own blue line . He maneuvered around Sherstobitoff , who tried to check him at the Princeton blue line , and came in alone on Tiger goalie Ron Dennis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side for his sixth goal of the season .
