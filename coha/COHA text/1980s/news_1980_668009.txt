The man who saved the Masters a year ago has had trouble lately saving something a good deal more important than any tennis tournament : himself . Twelve months before , Arthur Ashe had rescued a moribund Masters at Madison Square Garden with a performance of unlikely and unexpected brilliance , nearly seizing the championship from the kid bruiser , Johnny McEnroe , in the sort of match that might be labeled " heart- stopping " on the sports pages . Now , after his own heart had threatened to stop for a last time , it was not a matter of games-playing . Surgeons had to rescue Arthur Ashe from a fate worse than dead strings , and now he was playing his part at the Mastersfrom a chair , as a spectator . This was Wednesday night and McEnroe and Ashe were at the Garden again , but Ashe was a dozen rows away and no threat to the kid this time . Arthur was taking it easy in flannels and a beige cashmere turtleneck , and saying , " Just glad to be here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never thought I ' d die , but I did get the crap scared out of me , " said Ashe . For him the probability of a heart attack seemed as remote as a stroke of genius within a Boston politician . He was 36 , a successful professional athlete in serious training , didn ' t smoke , drank little and carried as much fat as a daddy longlegs on the Pritikin diet . Yet the attack came July 31 , and complications were to follow . " I am , " he smiled , " what you call a statistical anomaly - the longshot that comes in . It wasn ' t supposed to happen - but it did . " But , it didn ' t have anything to do with the way I was leading my life . It was hereditary . My father has had two heart attacks , and heart attacks and hypertension run in my family . Now , " said the Wimbledon champion of 1975 , " a great achievement for me is walking around the block a few times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will run again on the Elysian lawns of Wimbledon . " I don ' t think I ' m finished despite all that ' s happened , " Arthur said . His claque across the planet hope he is diagnosing correctly because Arthur has been much more than an exciting , winning racket-flapper . He has journeyed through the world with rare style , sensitivity and graciousness . Despite winning a fistsful of titles and millions of dollars , he has been able to make that obsolete virtue called sportsmanship seem respectable . Since Ashe is one of the jock minority who understand their professional obligations and responsibilities , sport will be bereft when he does pack it in . " Not yet , " he said . " In a month or so the doctors are gon na let me start hitting , and in two months I ' ll know if I can make a go of it again . There ' s just this feeling that I have some things to finish . I feel I ' ll be at Wimbledon again . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambler ' . . . to know when to hold and when to fold ' em . I think I ' ll know . " Yet merely a month ago , when the dreaded palpitatons began again in Jacksonville , Fla. , he felt light years away from Wimbledon ' s hushed Centre Court . " That is scary . I was in trouble and I knew it . I was watching TV , a Monday night football game with some friends . New Orleans was blowing it to Oakland , and I was blowing a $30 bet . Hell no , " he laughed , " I wasn ' t getting a coronary over a bet like that . " Nor , he said , had he been driven thrombotic by the Cosellian tones of his partner on ABC tennis telecasts . " But I knew something had to be done . I couldn ' t live in fear of these palpitations . I called a doctor in New York , and he said I ' d better think about a bypass . It didn ' t take long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . " He was going for the grand slam of heart surgery - a quadruple bypass . " It ' s all me , " he patted his chest . " They took veins from my legs , new healthy veins for my heart . My chest is a little sore from the surgery , but everything ' s OK . " He looks thinner , if that ' s possible , but explained it wasbecause his hair is closer cropped , the Afro reduced . " The doctors told me there was one percent chance I ' d die in surgery , and four to eight percent that I ' d have another attack on the table . Those are numbers I could deal with . Not one in a million , but one in a hundred is still a pretty good shot . I knew I didn ' t want to live as it was - in fear . " Ashe conceded his problem might have been more than hereditary , that stress may have been involved . " Yeah , that ' s a possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , he had been the Jackie Robinson of tennis . Hismentor , Dr. Walter Johnson , a black physician , had lectured him never to show any sign of distress or disapproval . Never blow up . " If I got a bad call , or a bad deal , if somebody acted racist when I was a kid , I was instructed to disregard it . I was never to give anybody any excuse to bar me , or not invite me back . " The cool exterior has frequently covered a cauldron . " I ' m lucky . I ' ve got plenty of things I can do besides tennis . . . but I don ' t think I ' m through . It ' s a strange feeling sitting here , my first match since July 29 in Kitzbuhel , Austria . My attack was two days later . " It ' s like I ' ve been asleep , like Rip Van Winkle , I suppose , and suddenly I ' m back . But nothing has changed . McEnroe is still bitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . " Watching McEnroe , I think of that final a year ago . " That was the Masters a/k/a Missers , the tournament passed up by Borg , Vilas and Gerulaitis . Ashe got in through the back door , having finished 10th in the Grand Prix - and darn near won it all . His march to the title bout gave the crowds heart flutters and resuscitated the tourney . " I remember the first match point . I thought I won it . I banged that backhand return for a winner . The Masters was mine . . . but the official said the serve was a fault . It wasn ' t , but . . . you have to accept . " He shrugged . Worse things have happened than blowing a title . Arthur Ashe , the man who saved the 1979 Masters , knew that better than most. * Even though Arthur Ashe has gone through quadruple bypass surgery , the 1975 Wimbledon champion hasn ' t given up the hope of returning to Centre Court . te ( AP photo ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
