NEW YORK  --  ITT Corp. slashed its dividend 64% and lowered its earnings forecast for all of 1984 . The big international conglomerate cut its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 69 cents . It last paid a 69-cent quarterly July 1 . Rand V. Araskog , ITT ' s chairman , president and chief executive officer , said the company ' s dividend-to-earnings ratio had become " inconsistent with the intensely competitive high technology environment . " ITT watchers predicted the dividend cut would cause many shareholders  --  especially institutions  --  who invested in ITT for its relatively high yield , to sell shares . ITT also said net income for the second quarter plunged about 50% . The company said net was 50 cents to 55 cents a share compared with $1. 03 a share a year earlier .

ITT said the dividend cut marked " a fundamental policy change . " The action affects stock of record Aug. 9 , with the dividend payout due Oct. 1 . Harry Edelson , a technology analyst at First Boston Corp. , said ITT " obviously wants a new image as a growth company and needs the cash . " ITT stock now will sell on the basis of earnings rather than yield , he said . " It ' s a shock that ITT , which has paid a higher dividend for 20 consecutive years , is cutting the dividend so sharply , " Mr. Edelson said . Even if the price of the stock drops six points because of this action , the yield would be only 4% , he added . " A lot of institutions , particularly state pension funds , can ' t hold a stock with a yield less than 5% , " he said . Mr. Araskog said directors approved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of investment in high technology products and services at over $2 billion annually .

But Mr. Araskog was optimistic about the company ' s automotive business , because of the end of the metalworkers strike in West Germany , where ITT has manufacturing operations . He also said earnings would improve in ITT ' s defense space business , financial services and industrial products area . Yet , in a recent interview , Mr. Araskog said , " Right now two or three of the businesses that are very important to our company as business areas aren ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited the casualty insurance , construction and forest products fields . " Right now it isn ' t upbeat . " Mr. Araskog added that ITT would sell off some companies " that do not fit long-range growth plans . " The company declined to name likely candidates for sale .

Recent divestitures include companies that make sanitary fixtures , automotive parts and housewares , an ITT spokesman said .
