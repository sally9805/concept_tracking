THE DUBLIN COAT A short story by George V. Higgins m ALOOF ARRIVED in the reception area at 9:55 for the 10:00 A.M. appointment with Sinibaldi . He declared his purpose to the receptionist behind the curved birch desk . She was about twenty and looked stupid , but she was bright enough to know that she had good breasts and wore a blouse opened to the fourth button , with a couple of gold chains dropping down into the vee to draw attention to her assets . Maloof had known a lot of girls like her , before he got married , and some women as well , since . He suspected that very few men noticed that she was stupid until afterward , when she found it necessary to speak . She told Maloof to sit down  --  she did not invite him to sit down  --  and she plugged the right place on the switchboard on the first try . She told Sinibaldi that Maloof had arrived . She said to Maloof : " He 'll be right out . " Maloof sat in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin in 1974 from a storekeeper who had not been able to find any large Irishmen who had $150 , the build for the coat or the liking for it , in the two years since he had made it . It was a very fine coat , as the shopkeeper had assured Maloof . It had fasted through five New England winters of snow , sleet , and freezing rain without losing its shape or fraying , or doing anything else that would have made a liar of the shopkeeper . As far as Maloof knew , the only disappointment attending the transaction had occurred at the outset , when the Jewish tailor had sought to soften up Maloof by inquiring whether Maloof had come to Ireland to visit the homes of his ancestors . Maloof , who had been in a cheery mood that day . had advised him that to visit the homes of his ancestors he would have to take another plane to Beirut . The shopkeeper suffered this ; he was a craftsman who wanted his work to be worn and appreciated if it pained him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a pain that he was determined to overcome , so that the beautiful coat would at last have an owner . Sinibaldi came out the door to Maloof 's left , behind the receptionist , who turned slightly in her chair and displayed her breasts to Sinibaldi . " Mister Maloof is here to see you , " she said , as she had said to him when she called him on the telephone . Sinibaldi was polite enough to glance at her offerings . Then he said : " Come on in , Eugene . " Maloof , beginning to feel warm in the Dublin coat , followed Sinibaldi back through the door and down the corridor . On his right there were light , airy offices with relaxing views of Boston City Hall and downtown office buildings , and small rooms on his left : windowless rooms where no more than three people could confer around small rectangular gray metal tables , while sitting on gray metal chairs and sharing large glass ashtrays . Sinibaldi walked slightly ahead of Maloof. and Maloof removed his Dublin coat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carr , Ltd. , underneath . " I tried to get in touch with you . Eugene , " Sinibaldi said . Sinibaldi was the only man Maloof knew well who called him Eugene . Everyone else started calling Maloof Gene the second time they saw him . Maloof 's classmates of twenty years ago at Holy Cross called him Alley Oop , because they had started off calling him AU , and then a record called " Alley Oop , " after the cartoon character , had come out while he was in college . so they had changed it . In The Crusader , Maloof 's exploits as a fullback had been reported as those of All Oop . Maloof with no need of an expensive legal secretary . This was a theory that worked better in the head than it did in the office , because Dolan kept hiring kids on the cheap , training them for six months , and accepting their resignations when they got enough experience to go to better-paying jobs with the John Hancock . But Dolan had no other quirks that Maloof knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolan could stand it . Anyway , Sinibaldi had talked either to Dolan or to Judy that morning , because nobody else was in the office , and Sinibaldi was well-acquainted with both of them , having spent hours in Maloof 's office examining papers . But Sinibaldi would never disclose which of them , unless directly interrogated , and maybe not even then . Maloof said : " I was going to go into the office after I dropped the kids off at school . They were late with breakfast again and missed the bus . But then I got stuck in that goddamned traffic , so I came directly here . " " Well , " Sinibaldi said , " no harm done , I suppose . Except that Reilly called and said the case he 's trying went longer'n he expected and the judge 's charging the jury at ten and sending them out , so it 'll be at least eleven before he can see us . " Maloof looked at his watch . It was a gold Rolex President that he had bought in the Bahamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen priced the same model at more than $5,000 . " Eleven , huh ? " he said . " Probably later , you want my opinion , " Sinibaldi said . " You know how Judge Maclver is when he gets a captive audience . " Sinibaldi had a law degree that he had got nights at the New England School of Law . He did not do anything with it , but neither did he wish anyone else with a law degree to forget that he had one , too . " I was thinking about that , " Maloof said . " Probably be closer to eleven-thirty , quarter of twelve , Reilly gets out of there . " " If you want to , " Sinibaldi said , " you could go over to your office and I could call you there when Reilly gets out and we could meet in his office . Or we could just sit here and shoot the shit for a while and see what develops . Maybe Maclver 's got a sore throat or something , and he shuts up early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of his suit jacket and brought out a box of English Oval cigarettes . Maloof allowed himself six English Ovals a day , except when he wanted time to think and permitted himself an extra one . From the lower right pocket of his vest he produced a gold Dunhill lighter . He held the lighter in his left hand and tapped the cigarette down on Sinibaldi 's desk . He put the cigarette in his mouth and lit it . He put the box back in his coat pocket and the lighter back in his vest pocket . There were two things to think about . At least two , Maloof decided . The first was that Sinibaldi had almost certainly known since shortly after 4:00 P.M. the previous day that Reilly had not finished his case , and would not be available until well after the ten o'clock appointment . Maloof had been in his office until nearly 6:30 . Sinibaldi had not called . Sinibaldi therefore wanted to have Maloof wait around in his office for an hour and a half or two , during which time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he obviously lacked . The second thing was that Sinibaldi was not stupid . He was ponderous and slow , like an overweight frog on a lily pad sagging dangerously under its bulk , needing smaller , lighter , more impetuous frogs to jump at flies within range and by missing them call Sinibaldi 's attention to them . But he was not stupid . Sinibaldi was just smart enough to know that he had to wait for somebody else to make a mistake . Maloof had had a tennis partner like that , John Benson . Benson could manage only one thing in the game  --  he almost always got the ball back over the net . He fell down and he scraped his knees and he had no more form than a sanitation worker heaving ashcans , but he almost always got the ball back over the net . Maloof and Benson won a lot of men 's doubles competitions on the strength of that one skill of Benson 's . Maloof smoked and thought about whether he would lose more by showing that he knew what Sinibaldi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know what Sinibaldi was up to . " I think , Steve , " Maloof said , having made up his mind , " I think what I better do is go back to the office and wait for your call . I 've got a hell of a lot of stuff backed up , and if I can get some of it out of the way , I probably should . How long you figure this is gon na take with Reilly , anyway ? " " Do n't really know , " Sinibaldi said , with just a slight smile . " Might take a couple hours , might take more . " " Which means , it pretty much shoots the rest of the day , then , " Maloof said . " They go out to lunch at one , they 're back at two , Reilly does n't know when that jury 's gon na come hack in , which he 'll have to interrupt to take the verdict for . Well , he wo n't have to , but Reilly 's never let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least . So we 'll interrupt for that . . . . Yeah , the rest of the day . If I 'm gon na get anything else done at all today , I 'd better go back . " Sinibaldi said : ' ' You heard anything from him ? " " From Reilly , " Maloof said . " No . I 've been going through you . " " Not Reilly , " Sinihaldi said . " Oh , " Maloof said . " No , no , I have n't heard from him . Nothing . " " You 're sure of that , " Sinibaldi said . " I think I 'd know , " Maloof said . He got up and started to put the Dublin coat on . " You know , Eugene , " Sinibaldi said . " I ca n't figure you . I 've never been able to figure you out . " " Be of good cheer , Steve , " Maloof said , leaving . " Nobody else can , either . " Reilly 's call was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Mall . The judge had completed his charge quickly , having started at 9:30 instead of 10:00 , and Reilly was free to talk . Dolan had not taken the call transferred from Judith . He looked inquiringly at Maloof . Maloof said : " Tell him I have n't come in yet , and you 'll give me the message as soon as I come in . " Dolan punched the button : " Hiyah , Peter , " he said . " Gene 's not here yet . Tell him as soon 's he gets in . Yup . " m ALOOF TOOK OFF the Dublin coat and his suit jacket . He accepted an offer of a cup of coffee from Judith . " Any other calls , Eddie ? " " Jeannine , " Dolan said . " Nobody else im-portant . " " Himself did n't call ? " Maloof said . Dolan shook his head . " Son of a bitch , " Maloof said . " The hell 's the man think I 'm supposed to do ? They got me between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got papers , Eddie , for Christ 's sake . I drew those papers up . My handwriting 's all over them . I ca n't sit there like Mickey the Dunce and claim I did n't know what 's in them , I 'm some kind of dummy that just wrote down what people told me and did n't know whether it was true or not . I certified it was true , under pains and penalties of perjury . I say I did n't know , they 've got me for perjury already , and do n't give me that shit about the statute of limitations ' run . Me and Simon 'll be competing as insurance adjusters in a week , the Bar Association gets ahold of that . Which they will do before the ink 's dry on the grand jury transcript , because Reilly is after the man 's hide . Fraudulent subscription to official 57 document ? Who cares , they ca n't prosecute ? They do n't need to , far as our happy little family 's concerned . And if I say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me , except that way I wo n't get disbarred  --  I 'll just have to testify in front of the Senate Ethics Committee about some things that the next Chairman of the Armed Services Committee did that were n't exactly legal , and I helped him do them . " " You want me to call him ? " Dolan said . " Yeah , " Maloof said . " No , on second thought , the minute he finds out I 'm calling , he 'll be in some kind of damned fool executive session which is not going on , and he 'll duck me again . Call Dickie Manning and tell him the time is rapidly approaching when I am going to have to empty my bowels , and what I want to know is whether he would like me to vomit on the floor or shit in the pot . No , do n't tell him that . Tell Dickie I want to talk to him . " Judy . " Maloof said , " call Reilly and tell him I came in and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I can . We did have these phones swept again , did n't we , Eddie ? " " Yup , " Dolan said . " Okay , " Maloof said , " get me Manning . I 'm gon na call Jeannine . " Jeannine did not waste time with greetings . " The FBI called right after you left , " she said . " I know , " he said . " I went right to their office . Sinibaldi 's office . He just wanted to tell me the meeting was delayed . " " Have you heard from the Great Man ? " she said . Maloof pictured her in the big yellow colonial with the white blinds , the house barely visible from the road behind the stone wall in Weston , the pool covered and frozen in the backyard , the tennis court swept against a possible warm day in January , her 450SL coupe in the garage , the maid 's Country Squire in the driveway , the whole establishment orderly and serene perhaps until the end of February . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " what are you going to do ? What does the man expect from you ? Are you supposed to ruin our lives because you got a legal fee for drawing up some papers for him ? " Maloof had not got a fee for drawing up the papers . He had done it as a favor to a mutual friend , who did not wish his own name to appear as attorney of record for the corporation . At the time Maloof had assumed the friend feared complications in a difficult divorce proceeding against him . He had never told Jeannine about the fee . " I do n't knowwhat to do , " he said . " Can you believe that ? I 'm forty-one years old . I came out of the bushes and here I am . I have always known what to do . I am completely baffled . I have no idea whatsoever of what to do . " " Well , Honey , " she said , " I think you 'd better think of something . " " Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed himself . In the next life , he decided , he would come back as a woman . A woman , confronted with the choice of ruining a U.S. senator or ruining herself , would be able to see how one choice was better than the other , and proceed efficiently to make it . " Dickie , " Maloof said , " Gene here . " Manning seemed able to contain his enthusiasm in taking the call . " Dickie , " Maloof said , " the skillet is hot and the fat is smoking . The fire do n't look much more inviting than the frying pan , and they are planning on doing some cooking this morning , starting with me . Got any new recipes ? " " Ali , " Manning said , " I do n't . I wished I did . He wo n't talk to me about it . He says he 'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . " " Dickie , " Maloof said , " he is not at the bridge . I am the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of shaky to me . Does n't he tell you anything ? " " Just that he knows he can count on you , " Manning said . " He can count on me ? " Maloof said . " Is that what he says ? " " Yup , " Manning said . " For Danbury , maybe ? " Maloof said . " Does the son of a bitch think I 'll go to Danbury for him ? Is that what he thinks ? That I 'll ruin my life and family for him ? " " Ali , " Manning said , " the last time I spoke to him about it , he got this big grin on his face and said : Ah , shit . Gene Maloof ? The kid I took to Ireland with me ? The kid I sent all that business to ? Gene 's a nice boy , a fine boy , and he 's loyal . Gene 's never hurt me . You told me that yourself , Dickie . Old classmate of yours ? Did n't you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried . Dickie 's friend Gene 'll think of something . ' " " And that 's it , " Maloof said . " That 's it , " Manning said . " He even told me how he bought you that coat . ' Finest coat in Dublin town , ' he said . ' Took him in to see this little Jew tailor I know there , got him the finest coat you ever saw . Gene 'll be all right . ' " " I bought that fucking coat with my own goddamned money , " Maloof said . " You know that . I paid for my own goddamned trip . You know that , too . " " And you know , Gene , " Manning said softly , " that you asked me to get you invited on 58 that trip because they 've got a lot of defense contractors up around Boston . and you did n't think it would do you any harm if your name was in the papers on the senator 's trip to Ireland . Do n't you , Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it did n't do you any harm , did it , Gene ? " Manning said . " No , " Maloof said , " it did me a lot of good . " " Well , " Manning said , " that 's what he 's counting on . He did n't buy you the coat , maybe , although by now he thinks he did , but he got you what you wanted and you took it . I guess what he expects is for you to be loyal . " I ATE IN THE cold afternoon , Maloof emerged from the room where the fed- eral grand jury holds its sessions on Jthe eleventh floor of the Post Office and Courthouse Building in Boston . Peter Reilly , looking very annoyed , pushed by the reporters and said , " No comment , " though he had just won a significant jury case in front of Judge Mather that day . The reporters were not interested in that . Reilly was very short with Steve Sinibaldi of the FBI , who was waiting in his office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maloof . " Ladies and gentlemen , " Maloof said , " I will give you a statement , but it will be brief , and I wo n't answer any questions . Fair enough ? " No one objected to this proposal . " I appeared before the grand jury today at the invitation of the U.S. Attorney . I was invited . I was not under subpoena . I appeared voluntarily . Mr. Reilly showed me certain documents having to do with articles of incorporation of three businesses in Massachusetts . Those papers were drawn up in my office . I was the attorney of record . " Among those with interest in those businesses , and I emphasize that there were no fewer than twenty-three people involved as shareholders , was Sen. John Cobb of Maryland . I was aware that Senator Cobb was a party in interest , although to he sure it was a minor interest . At least I believe I was  --  those companies were formed more than six years ago , and my recollection is a little hazy . " As I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Cobb 's participation in the enterprises . The businesses were perfectly open and aboveboard . There was , then , no prohibition against a U.S. senator investing in a private business . Indeed , I am not sure that there is even now . Or if there was a prohibition , I was not aware of it , and neither , I am sure , was Senator Cobb . " Technically , " Maloof said , " there may have been an offense . Actually , none was intended , and when government loan guarantees were obtained for those businesses later on , it was done in the same innocent purpose . Those loans have all been repaid . The government never lost a dime . That 's what I told the grand jury , and that 's what I 'm telling you . And that 's all I 'm telling you . " Maloof repeated his statement for the television reporters on the street outside , where cameras were allowed . He refused further comment . But around seven that night , after the story had been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's third drink , and congratulated him . " Ali , " he said , " I did n't think you could pull it off . " " Dickie , " Maloof said , " let us have no more cheap discussion about how somebody bought me a coat that I paid for with my own money , because I am tired of it . Let us talk instead of more important things . " " Such as what ? " Manning said . " Oh , I do n't know , " Maloof said . " Cabbages , kings , the other stuff the walrus mentioned . " " He can not put you on the Supreme Court , " Manning said . " No , " Maloof said , " he ca n't . And if he could , that would give me another reason to hate him , because I do n't want to he on the Supreme Court and I will kill any son of a bitch that nominates me . " On the other hand , " Maloof said , " I can put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time that will get him rehabilitated . But I can put him in there , and I am almost mad enough to do it , and it will not improve his political career if I get a little madder . " " Gene , " Manning said , " you are not talking sense . " " Dickie , " Maloof said , " I will try to be precise , so that even you and John Cobb can understand my meaning . This is not my last call . It probably is not my next-to-last call . But from now on , every call I make to you will be answered or returned by you , and every call I make to him will be answered or returned by him . Is that reasonably clear ? " " Yes , " Manning said . " Good , " Maloof said . " Now that we have that out of the way , let us reflect upon the fact that my coat is wearing out . and Cobb has obtained better access than God to the weapons makers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning said . " No , " Maloof said , " you were not . What scared you was what I might say about financing agreements , when the grand jury was listening .
