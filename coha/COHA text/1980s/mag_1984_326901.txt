An accident in Mexico exposes scores of people to radiation <P> Victims are not usually culprits , but Vincente Sotelo is both . Sotelo , 29 , unwittingly caused what some U.S. scientists are calling the worst nuclear accident ever in North America . As a result , he and 200 other residents of Ciudad Jurez , a Mexican town just across the Rio Grande from El Paso , are undergoing long-term tests for possible radiation poisoning , a condition that could result in genetic damage or cancer . Although Mexican authorities have been playing down the crisis , the people of Ciudad Jurez are the potential victims of exposure to dangerous levels of radiation . <P> The sequence of events that led to the disaster began last November . Sotelo , then a $35-a-week hospital electrician with a family of three , took a milk bottle-size , stainless-steel canister from the hospital 's warehouse . Sotelo says hospital administrators had given him permission to sell leftover utensils for scrap . He heaved the canister into the back of a hospital truck and hauled it to a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , Sotelo and the dealer were unaware that the canister was part of a radiography machine and contained a capsule that held approximately 6,000 pinhead pellets of cobalt 60 , a powerful isotope used in the treatment of cancer . Later , at some undetermined point , the capsule in the canister broke open ; hundreds of pellets were subsequently scattered throughout the truck and the junkyard . Even the junkyard 's paperwork later proved to be radioactive . Many of the pellets in the dusty lot were pulverized and mixed up with the heaps of metal scrap . <P> Over the next two months , 20 junkyard workers were exposed to various levels of radiation . According to doctors , at least four of these men received very high doses . Two of the four absorbed 100 times the maximum amount of gamma rays that U.S. nuclear workers are allowed to receive in an entire year . One of the pair has sore gums ; the other suffered nosebleeds . Says one investigating doctor : " Their chances of developing cancer are probably pretty good . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heavily contaminated truck that Sotelo had driven sat idle for two months on a narrow street in the town 's crowded Bellavista neighborhood . ( The vehicle was later removed to a compound near Jurez , and then to an isolated area 20 miles from the city . ) " Children played on the truck , " says Sotelo . " People would stand beside it , talking , and lean back on it . " <P> The area of hazard grew even wider as radioactive scrap from the junkyard was transported to two Mexican foundries , one in Ciudad Jurez , the other 220 miles south in Chihuahua . According to Jos Antonio Rotonda of the Mexican Nuclear Commission , radioactive pellets that had adhered to scraps in the truck fell off en route to Chihuahua , and eight pockets of contamination have been discovered between the two cities .
