Among the hundreds of journalists present at last week 's ill-fated launch of the space shuttle Challenger were two veteran TIME space watchers : Correspondent Jerry Hannifin and Photographer Ralph Morse . Between them they have logged nearly six decades covering the U.S. space program . As Morse peered through his telephoto lens at the swiftly rising Challenger , he remarked that the lift-off appeared sluggish . " Do n't kid yourself , " said Morse . " They 're in trouble up there . " <P> As the eerily silent orange-yellow blossom of flame suddenly appeared above them , Morse frantically searched through his lens for the speck that might be the separating shuttle , headed for an emergency landing or ditching in the ocean . " Get over to the landing site , " he shouted at his assistant . But it was apparent from the cobweb-like streamers filling the sky after the explosion that there was little hope the astronauts had survived . <P> Hannifin headed for the phone to alert TIME 's editors to the worst space disaster in U.S. history , the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Ajemian promptly left for Concord , N.H. , the home of Teacher Christa McAuliffe . Houston Bureau Chief David Jackson monitored developments at the Johnson Space Center . Washington Correspondent Jay Branegan pored over the tragedy with NASA experts in the nation 's capital . In New York City , Senior Writer Ed Magnuson , who wrote the main story , and a 31- member editorial team awaited their telexed reports . <P> Morse , who photographed the launching of the first U.S. satellite , Explorer I , from Cape Canaveral in 1958 , and has been on hand for nearly every manned flight since , vividly recalls the only previous tragedy in the U.S. space program . It occurred in 1967 , when an Apollo capsule caught fire on the launch pad , and Astronauts Virgil ( " Gus " ) Grissom , Edward White and Roger Chaffee perished in the inferno . Only the day before , Morse had been shooting aboard their spacecraft , and his photos of the three men lying strapped in their seats were used by NASA to study the accident that killed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeronautics and space from the heyday of the 1950s , when daring test pilots were attempting to fly fixed- wing aircraft into space . A longtime aviator , Hannifin was quick to apply to be the first journalist in space . Says he : " When shuttle operations resume  --  and I have no doubt that they will , after the Challenger 's problem is analyzed and fixed  --  I want to go . "
