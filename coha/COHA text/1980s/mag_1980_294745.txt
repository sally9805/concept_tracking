Reagan struggles to form a Cabinet able-and willing-to serve <P> Early in the evening , a yellow Ford pulled up to the southwest entrance of the White House . Transition boss Edwin Meese and Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt piled out and proceeded to the Situation Room in the basement . They were about to make their nightly call to Ronald Reagan at his Pacific Palisades home and now they felt it necessary to use the most tap-proof telephones in the nation to discuss the most top-secret political topic in town : Who would be members of his new Cabinet ? <P> Meese , Laxalt , a few other aides and Reagan were about the only people in the country who knew for sure last week what was going on . Outside Reagan 's home , reporters stood long vigils waiting vainly for scraps of information . When Reagan emerged from conferences with his lieutenants to attend a series of private dinners , he merely smiled away correspondents ' questions . In Washington rumors and speculation buzzed louder every day , reproducing a touch of the he's-down , he's-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's radio-announcing days . <P> Long lists of " all-but-certain " Cabinet members appeared daily in the nation 's press , only to change with the next edition . Like Kremlinologists , Washington 's mighty attempted to read vast significance into who was placed next to whom at dinners . Meese created a stir at one by sitting next to the wife of former NATO Commander Alexander Haig . But Haig , who was also present , would say nothing , and Meese kept repeating his favorite line : " Those who know are n't talking , and those who are talking do n't know . " <P> There was much more to the hubbub than deliberate mystification . Meese insisted that the selection process was proceeding on schedule , and at least the first appointments are expected to be announced this week , about the time incoming Presidents generally disclose their choices . But there were strong indications that the " Reaganauts , " as the transition aides have taken to calling themselves , were having unexpected trouble making some of their boss 's first choices stick . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient business-management techniques to Government . But it was even more surprising because Reagan was known to have decided on his initial top choices at meetings with his California kitchen cabinet before Thanksgiving , providing ample time to notify and check out the chosen . <P> One problem that turned out to be severe was the danger that a nominee would have a conflict of interest-or the appearance of it-between his private affairs and his Government job . Reagan is the first President-elect to staff a full Cabinet under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act , which tightens financial reporting for top Government officers and sets up elaborate rules to guard against a clash between their federal and private lives . Says Meese : " A President-elect used to call up a prospective Cabinet member . He would consult with his wife , call back in 24 hours and the deed was done . Now he has to sit down with a lawyer from the transition team , his own lawyer , his accountant and a number of others . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
