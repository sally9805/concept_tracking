Misty Lima , with its quaint colonial architecture and pleasant neighborhoods , is being squeezed by invading slums . Running along a seaside road , a jogger sees servants and municipal workers dumping garbage on the cliffs . In his latest novel , Peru 's Mario Vargas Llosa supersedes this real present with a likely future . In the provinces , government forces supported by U.S. Marines battle insurgents backed by the Soviet Union , Cuba and Bolivia . But it is the past that is central to the book . Its narrator is a Vargas Llosa-like writer in search of information for a novel about his former Marxist classmate Alejandro Mayta . Was he a hero or just a " forty-year-old man with flat feet , who 's spent his life in the catacombs of theoretical revolution ? " <P> Alejandro is an illusive character because his friends and enemies tell contradictory stories about him , but more important because the narrator repeatedly reminds the reader that his investigations are a preparation for lying , for conjuring a fiction . Such modernist hugger-mugger has great potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts allow him to toy with uncertainty and shuffle time with deceptive ease . A good deal of Peru 's mournful history and wretched present are economically conveyed . Leaving the Museum of the Inquisition , the narrator is confronted by a score of beggars . " They constitute a sort of grotesque royal court of tatters , grime , and scabs , " he observes . " As soon as they see me , they stretch out their black-nailed hands and beg . Violence behind me and hunger in front of me . Here , on these stairs , my country summarized . " <P> This and similarly graphic scenes serve to frame the novel 's artfully related subjects : the fiction writer 's need to acknowledge the deceitful nature of his craft , and the political activist 's need to convince himself that his ideology is the only truth . The tragedy of Alejandro Mayta is that the give-and-take of public affairs is too perplexing for his blind faith . Like the narrator , he can not escape the comic ironies that respect no certitudes . When free as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imprisoned , he is a revolutionary whose zeal leads to reforming the convicts ' commissary and a modest career in capitalism .
