Beirut 's dwellers refuse to surrender to despair <P> For the past two months Beirut has again been rocked by artillery duels between competing militia groups . The latest outburst of violence reached its climax last week on a warm Sunday afternoon when the Mediterranean was a deep , shadowy blue , with only a suggestion of surf , and the beaches were crowded . Suddenly , unaccountably , the Christians and Muslims both began to shell the area . The carnage : 20 dead and 270 wounded . How have the 1 million Beirutis been coping with the relentless destruction of their once beautiful city and the periodic slaughter of their people ? Reports TIME Middle East Bureau Chief William Stewart : <P> <P> It is a measure of Beirut 's battle-hardened toughness that only two days after the attacks , stores reopened , trade flourished and the bars and restaurants were once again jammed with pleasure-seekers . The flower shops that proliferate in almost every quarter of the city were filled with carnations and snapdragons that spilled over onto the sidewalk in elegant displays . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best fresh food in the Middle East were doing a thriving business . All the city 's 86 banks - more numerous than before the civil war-were open for business . The British embassy went ahead with a reception for David Roberts , Her Majesty 's new Ambassador . Shrugged one bejeweled Beirut partygoer : " What else can we do ? <P> One has to go out . " <P> Only a block from the site of the shelling on the beach , construction workers were back on the job building a 14-story luxury apartment house . All of Beirut 's six universities remained open . At the Commodore Hotel 's famed circular bar , bankers , businessmen , armed security guards , militiamen , spies and a few tourists were talking about land values . Indeed all over Beirut , the wheeling and dealing for which the city is celebrated had resumed . With land scarce and money plentiful because hardly anyone pays taxes , the Beirutis continue to invest heavily in property that has risen astronomically in price despite the destruction . Said one businessman : " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while those who had them are rebuilding . I know a family whose home has been destroyed three times , and they have rebuilt three times . You ca n't kill hope . " <P> Hope is conspicuously alive at Summerland , the $25 million seaside resort built during the civil war . Though many of its 151 rooms are empty , the hotel has kept on a staff of more than 300 , in the expectation that better days must surely follow . Summerland 's bar , restaurant and two outdoor pools are still crowded . Said Sheik Khaled Saab , Summerland 's part owner and general manager : " We Beirutis have the will to live . We 've become immune to many things . We know if the artillery is ' incoming ' or ' outgoing . ' We can even tell the caliber . We 're all optimists . Keeping this place open is an act of faith in the country . " <P>
