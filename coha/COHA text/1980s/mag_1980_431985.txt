Carter 's Anti-In$ . President Carter 's anti-inflation program is another in a long series of cosmetic measures designed more to quiet public outcry than to resolve our serious economic problem . That problem has two faces : inflation and declining productivity . Inflation has discouraged productive investment and fostered economic inefficiency . Declining productivity has contributed to inflation . We badly need a coordinated attack on both inflation and declining productivity . The obstacle to launching such an attack is not a lack of knowledge of what to do . The obstacle is a lack of political will and leadership to do what has to be done . Any effective attack must have three key ingredients : 1 . Monetary Restraint . A gradual reduction over a period of three to five years in the rate of growth of the quantity of money to a level consistent with stable prices . Such a policy was announced by the Federal Reserve System on Oct. 6 , 1979 . However , performance has been uneven . In view of the wide difference in the past between what the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be persistently met before any policy can attain credibility and thereby have maximum impact . 2 . Fiscal Restraint . A drastic cut in taxes ? not just visible taxes but also invisible taxes ? and thoroughgoing reform of the tax structure . The true tax burden on the American people is what government spends , not what the accountants label " tax receipts . " If the government spends more than it receives in visible taxes , who do you suppose pays for the difference ? You and I do , through the hidden tax of inflation or the even more subtle hidden tax involved in government borrowing from the public . And the true tax burden has been exploding . President Carter proposes to cut projected spending for fiscal 1980 ( ending Sept. 30 , 19800 ) by an unspecified amount and for fiscal 1981 by $13 billion to $14 billion . That is sending an infant to do an adult 's job . Consider the figures in the accompanying table . Projected spending for fiscal 1980 was revised upward by $32 billion between January 1979 and January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actual spending will almost surely be still higher . Compare the proposed $14 billion " cut " for fiscal 1981 with the $38 billion upward revision in projected spending for that year , or with the $52 billion increase in projected spending from fiscal 1980 to fiscal 1981 . President Carter may talk about ending inflation but his own budget numbers assume continued high inflation . Which is the surer guide ? President Carter has not proposed a meaningful cut in spending . He has simply proposed a slightly smaller increase . We should be considering cuts of $60 billion to $100 billion in fiscal 1981 projected spending , not $14 billion . President Carter stressed the need for a balanced budget . He has been able to promise a balanced budget , despite the small cuts in spending , only because there is already in train a $50 billion to $75 billion increase in recorded taxes as a result of measures already passed and of inflation . As further assurance , he pointed to receipts from a " conservation fee " he is levying on imported oil . ( We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense does it make to subsidize with the left hand and tax with the right ? ) Balancing the bookkeeping budget is not the real problem . The easiest way to do that would be to accelerate the inflation . That would raise recorded tax receipts faster than recorded spending . The real problem is the explosive growth in government @# spending . Government outlays of $400 billion with a $100 billion book deficit would be far healthier for the economy than government spending of $600 billion with a balanced budget ? and would be easier to accommodate without inflation . 3 . Curbing Regulations and Controls . The tidal wave of regulation during the past decade has been counterproductive . It is a major source of declining productivity . We should eliminate price controls on natural gas , crude oil and other petroleum products and , along with that , the incredibly complicated entitlements system . These are the major sources of the energy crisis . We should end the mislabeled " voluntary " price and wage controls and abolish the Council on Wage and Price Stability . Return Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he has demonstrated great competence . Instead , President Carter proposes more regulation and more controls : controls on credit ; more reliance on " voluntary " price and wage controls and a tripling of the staff of the Council on Wage and Price Stability ; more regulations of energy ? all harmful evasions of the basic problem . In my opinion , the American public is far ahead of Washington . It will recognize cosmetics and political opportunism for what they are . It is ready to be told the truth . We are reaping the accumulated harvest of mismanagement of the economy over the past several decades , by Republican and Democratic administrations alike . There is no quick fix for the resulting economic ills . Even the best policies will take time and involve a difficult transition . But we simply have no good options . So let us get to it and put our house in order . Inflation rates on a month-to-month basis will be coming down almost regardless of government policy , simply because recent very high rates reflect transitory shocks . The basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as high as the nearly 20 per cent rate of recent months . President Carter will both take credit for and be given credit for any improvement . That is perhaps the greatest danger from his cosmetic proposals . We may be lulled into postponing still longer an effective attack on our fundamental problem . 33
