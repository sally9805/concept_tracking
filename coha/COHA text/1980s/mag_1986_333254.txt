Beauty pageants are supposed to be Cinderella tales , where at the grand finale the queen sobs tears of joy while the losers hug her valiantly . Last week the Miss Thailand World contest ended up in a guerrilla-style skirmish that looked more like a nasty palace coup . While TV cameras recorded the scene , Newly Crowned Saengravee Asavarak , 22 , was beaming before a Bangkok audience of 2,000 when someone grabbed her tiara and put it on the head of the sobbing first runner-up . Then another hand attempted to pull off her winner 's sash . Saengravee was popular with the audience , but hardly with other contestants . Some accused her of having her makeup done outside ( rather than using Avon cosmetics like everyone else ) , wearing false eyelashes and having had her nose fixed . When the melee died down , Saengravee wore her crown and sash and was smiling bravely .
