Iraq said its warplanes had successfully attacked " two very large naval targets " - the phrase it usually uses to designate a tanker . The sources could confirm only that one ship was hit . Iraq also warned that it planned to step up strikes against ships calling at Kharg Island , the only point in the Persian Gulf where Iran can still deliver oil to its customers. // Early this morning the 260 , 000-ton Swiss-owned and Liberian-registered tanker Tiburon put out a distress call , saying its engine room was on fire and several crewmen were injured . Shipping sources in Bahrain and in Zurich said they believed the ship had been hit by an Exocet missile fired from an Iraqi warplane . A salvage tug was on its way from Bahrain to give assistance. // Iran ' s Islamic leadership immediately vowed revenge for the attack. // After a Cabinet meeting in Teheran , Iran ' s Prime Minister , Mir Hussein Moussavi , said , " We will deliver a blow for every blow we receive . " He also warned that Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Security in the gulf must apply to all or to none . " <> <> Lull Ended Sunday // The attack on the Tiburon was reported to have occurred about 100 miles south of Kharg Island , where several other ships have been hit by Iraqi planes this year . The attack came three days after Iraq first broke a two- week lull in attacks on gulf shipping . On Sunday an Iraqi plane damaged the Greek-owned tanker Alexander the Great with an Exocet missile while the vessel was loading oil at Kharg Island . Some oil-loading installations at the terminal were also reportedly damaged in the attack. // An Iraqi military spokesman said today on the Baghdad radio that the latest attacks showed " Iraq is tightening its blockade of Kharg Island and other Iranian ports on the gulf. " // He called the strike " further proof of Iraq ' s resolve to carry out its previous warnings to all shipping companies to end their dealings with the Iranian regime . " The spokesman said future attacks would be " even more severe. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Iran since September 1980 , is trying to weaken the Iranians by cutting off their oil sales , which Teheran relies on to pay for arms and munitions . <> <> Backing for Iraq // The leaders of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and other gulf nations are backing Iraq , contributing billions of dollars to its war effort , because they fear the destabilizing effect of an outright victory for Iran ' s revolutionary regime. // Iran ' s leaders have responded to the attempt to blockade Kharg Island by launching several air strikes against tankers carrying Saudi and Kuwaiti oil . They have also made a vague threat to blockade the gulf by closing the Strait of Hormuz , through which 17 percent of the non-Communist world ' s oil supplies pass. // Since April 18 Iraq is believed to have attacked 10 tankers moving through the gulf and Iran is believed to have attacked 5. // In the last few days Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations have sent their air forces to fly protective patrols over tankers and other ships using their ports . These fighter planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . <> <> No Response So Far // So far this protective air shield has deterred Iran from trying to retaliate for the two Iraqi attacks this week . But diplomats in Bahrain say they remain apprehensive that Iran might soon seek revenge , further heightening the war. // It is unclear whether the two latest Iraqi air attacks are deterring vessels from going to Kharg Island . Earlier this year Iran was reported to have seen its Kharg Island sales fall from the usual level , about 1. 8 million barrels a day , to under a million barrels a day as a result of the fighting. // Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suffered less , partly because they offered to replace lost oil free of charge and also because they used their own tankers to ferry supplies down the gulf to foreign vessels waiting in the safe waters of the Arabian Sea. // In the two-week lull in the fighting , Iran ' s exports were reported back to normal levels . <> <> Accord on Civilian Targets // Earlier this month Iran and Iraq accepted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing not to hit civilian targets . But Western intelligence has reported that about half a million Iranian soldiers are now massed along the front line with Iraq , apparently in preparation for a new offensive . After the Iraqi attack last Sunday on the Alexander the Great , the Baghdad radio warned that Iraq would destroy the Kharg Island terminal if Iran launched a new ground assault. // Further evidence of support for Iraq came today from Jordan , where the official press agency quoted King Hussein as telling King Fahd of Saudi Arabia that Jordan would " stand by its brothers in defending their lands , waters and sovereignty . " The two Kings met in Jidda on Tuesday. // // <> <> U.S. Arms Sale to Kuwait // // WASHINGTON , June 27 - The Defense Department notified Congress today that it plans to sell Kuwait improved antiaircraft equipment worth $82 million. // The sale would provide Kuwait , a Persian Gulf nation that says it believes it is threatened by possible attack from Iran , with improvements in its Hawk antiaiacraft mnissiles and its radar equipment. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stinger antiaircraft missiles sold last month to Saudi Arabia . Congressional critics of the Stinger sale have argued that the Stingers could fall into the hands of terrorists for use against civilian planes. // In another development , the White House said that Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the Saudi Arabian Ambassador , met for 15 minutes with President Reagan and conveyed a message from King Fahd about the situation in the Persian Gulf. // Afterward , Prince Bandar said the Saudis were hoping that " common sense will prevail " in the region and prevent the war from escalating. // //
