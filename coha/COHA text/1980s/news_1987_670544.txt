Randy Travis , Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle , the Young Turks of what has been called the " new traditionalist " movement , each scored substantial commercial successes last year with their debut albums . And their follow-up records , all released within the last month , are at least as impressive as their predecessors. // One of the healthiest aspects of the new traditionalism is that it is not a specific sound but a highly adaptable purist esthetic . Whereas in mainstream urban pop , the latest sensations , from Prince to Madonna to Anita Baker to Janet Jackson , are quickly cloned into studio formulas featuring inferior sound-alike voices , the sparsely textured records of the new traditionalists are as different from one another as the idiosyncratic sensibilities of the composer-performers themselves . If they share one trait in common , it is their rejection of the homogenized studio opulence and ad-copy homilies of Alabama , Kenny Rogers , Barbara Mandrell , Lee Greenwood and other acts from the broadloom school of country. // Randy Travis , the young North Carolinian whose debut album , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million copies , is the preeminent singer among the new traditionalists . Mr. Travis possesses a once-in-a-generation country twang that seems to quiver perpetually on the edge of an emotional precipice while maintaining a secure technical footing . His extreme delicacy and perfect control suggest a blending of the young James Taylor ( also a North Carolinian ) with Merle Haggard , but without the former ' s lurking neurasthenia or the latter ' s hard-boiled machismo . His refined country phrasing , with its exquisite half-yodeled melismas inspired by the slippery whine of traditional steel guitar , are the marks of a meticulous craftsman whose respect for the formal conventions of classic honky-tonk singing verges on reverence. // Mr. Travis ' s new album , " Always &; Forever " ( Warner Bros. 25568 ; LP , cassette , compact disk ) , like " Storms of Life , " was produced by Kyle Lehning , who has lovingly woven the record ' s predominantly acoustic textures around the singer ' s remarkable voice . The most striking cut , " My House , " is a hymnlike country waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bliss . Twining around Mark O ' Connor ' s country fiddle , Mr. Travis ' s sweetly astringent voice imparts a fervent prayerful intensity to a line like " My house is filled with the things that I love. " // Where other new traditionalists bring a contemporary , autobiographical perspective to their albums , Mr. Travis is a country classicist not only in his delivery but in his material , which describes love and life in relatively abstract terms . Gene Pistilli ' s " Too Gone Too Long " is a jaunty generic 30 ' s country-swing tune by a contemporary writer . And Mr. Travis ' s best original songs , " Good Intentions " and " I Told You So , " present stock country scenarios - a wastrel ' s lament and a lover ' s repentance described in fairly general terms . It is Mr. Travis ' s gently keening voice that transforms familiar sentiments into starkly poignant reveries . Unlike Mr. Travis , Dwight Yoakam , a Kentuckian now living in California , is knowingly " postmodern " both in his presentation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flashy dude-ranch jacket and wide-brimmed hat , Mr. Yoakam suggests a latter-day singing cowboy . And his music freely interweaves 50 ' s and early 60 ' s rock-and-roll influences with the rough-and-tumble side of country honky-tonk. // The opposite of a perfectionist vocal technician like Mr. Travis , Mr. Yoakam has a stringy , sullen delivery with a droll undercurrent that comes to the fore in his slightly exaggerated yodel . Historically , the singer touches two very different bases on his new album , " Hillbilly Deluxe " ( Reprise 25567 ; LP , cassette , compact disk ) . His surly update of the 1951 Lefty Frizzell hit , " Always Late With Your Kisses , " more or less re-creates the roadhouse honky-tonk sound of country music ' s golden age , while the vintage Elvis Presley hit " Little Sister " has the informal good humor of a country bar-band jam. // Of the album ' s seven original songs , the most powerful is " Readin ' , Rightin ' , Rt. 23 , " the saga of a Kentucky coal mining family whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better life in the city . " They ' d learned readin ' , rightin , ' Route 23/ To the jobs that laid waiting in those cities ' factories/ They didn ' t know that old highway could lead them to a world of misery , " the singer reflects wryly . A thread of Gothic melodrama also runs through several Yoakam songs that describe , among other phenomena , a love that literally refuses to die and a suicidal drinking spree. // The new traditionalist who has advanced the farthest and who shows the strongest potential to win a mainstream rock audience is a Texan country-rocker , Steve Earle , whose debut album , " Guitar Town , " won wide critical acclaim last year . Its successor , " Exit O " ( MCA 5998 ; LP , cassette , compact disk ) , is only marginally more rural in flavor than the open-road anthems of Creedence Clearwater Revival , the Eagles or the late-60 ' s Bob Dylan . And Mr. Earle ' s yowling buzzsaw voice , so reminiscent at times of Mr. Dylan ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twang. // Mr. Earle ' s sardonically fatalistic song lyrics express a much broader and more pointed social outlook than country music has traditionally allowed . " The Rain Came Down , " a sprawling rock ballad in the style of Creedence Clearwater Revival , is a biting , anguished mini-epic that traces three generations of farmers from an idealistic past to a despairing present . " Angry Young Man " and " I Ain ' t Never Satisfied " are disturbing first-person dramatic monologues that depict a bohemian blue-collar angst that has no specific cause or cure. // " Angry Young Man " is especially wrenching , because it is a son ' s confession to his mother : " Mama if you could see me right now/ You ' d be so sure you failed me somehow/ Mama you never could understand/ There ain ' t no peace for an angry young man . " Born on the wrong side of the tracks , the protagonist of " I Ain ' t Never Satisfied " was brought up by his mother after his father abandoned the family . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I had me a woman she was my world/ But I ran off with my back street girl . " At the end of the song , the singer dies and acerbically refuses an invitation to heaven. // " Exit 0 " is not all dark . The novelty " Sweet Little ' 66 " describes the narrator ' s fetishistic attachment to an old Chevrolet , and " 29 , " a memoir of high school football days , expresses the same bittersweet grown-up resignation as Bruce Springsteen ' s " Glory Days . " " Exit 0 " is framed by two songs that evoke an overriding intimation of the absurd . " The keeper of the gate is blind , " reflects the narrator of the metaphysical highway song , " Nowhere Road , " that opens the record . " Exit 0 ' s " finale , " It ' s All Up to You , " is an existential shot in the dark whose message of self-reliance is only superficially upbeat . " Ain ' t no candle in no window/ You ' ve got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song ' s harshest lines . This exhilarating , troubling album , which could help spark a country-rock revival , challenges the intransigent provincialism of country music with a compelling insistency. //
