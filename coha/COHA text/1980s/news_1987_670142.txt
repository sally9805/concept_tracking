The boss ' s raise seems to be getting smaller and smaller . Proxy statements this spring are expected to show that increases in senior executives ' 1986 compensation , including base salaries and bonuses , were the smallest since the 1983 recession : about 6. 5% compared with almost 11% in 1985 . Middle managers fared even worse , and neither group , compensation consultants say , should expect much improvement in 1987 . But don ' t cry for the boss just yet . Although companies are becoming stingier with salaries , many firms are creating new , if complicated , long-term compensation plans that account for an increasingly large percentage of senior executives ' pay . Those plans ( see glossary below ) are designed to reward strategic gains rather than short-term contributions to profit and can be highly lucrative . Meanwhile , pay policies for middle managers are changing , too . Takeovers and restructurings have decimated middle-management ranks , and some employers are changing their salary structures to benefit remaining workers . The complexities and idiosyncrasies of all these plans , which vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall change in executive compensation . But most compensation professionals agree that executives aren ' t being penalized by the emphasis on the long term . " The end game is that people get a little bit more money than they did before , " says Gary Hourihan , president of Management Compensation Group . In 1986 , senior executives actually fared pretty well in increases in base salaries alone . According to Sibson &; Co. , a compensation consultant , base salaries rose by about 5. 9% after inflation , compared with 3. 8% in 1985 . ( Senior executives are defined as heads of major divisions , vice presidents in charge of such functions as law , human resources , marketing or finance , and all higher executives . ) They typically earned between $100 , 000 and $300 , 000 in base salary last year . Some 86% received salary increases last year , down from 90% in 1985 . But the executives got hit when it came to bonuses . Counting bonuses awarded last year for 1985 performance , total 1986 compensation among senior executives rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 6. 9% in 1985 . Bonuses in 1986 were smaller , reflecting 1985 ' s unimpressive corporate earnings , which for the 500 largest U.S. companies fell by 19% . For chief executives , 1986 salaries plus bonuses rose by 6. 9% after inflation , compared with 10. 9% in 1985 . But many executives may have actually gained far more . Tax-law changes and a strong stock market encouraged many to exercise stock options and sell the stock they acquired . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 358. 22 points last year , and the tax law was changed to eliminate favorable capital-gains rates after 1986 , providing an incentive for executives to take their gains . This year , Sibson expects a 6% increase in senior executive salaries , before inflation . Including bonuses , compensation should rise about 7% . But salaries and bonuses comprise a smaller part of total executive compensation than in years past . Mr. Hourihan of Management Compensation Group says long-term compensation now accounts for as much as 30% of the total , up from perhaps 20% a few years ago . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation as incentives , companies can more easily hold down the pay of poorer performers while rewarding corporate stars . At Xerox Corp. , for example , base salaries for comparable positions may vary by only 3% to 6% , says Douglas Reid , a senior vice president . But bonuses may increase the variation from base salary as much as 50% . He says Xerox is using bonuses , rather than salary increases , to help keep executive salaries in line with those paid by competitors . Such a system also helps control costs , he says , so that in a deep recession the employer won ' t get stuck paying unduly high salaries . Moreover , says Mr. Reid , " We think it ' s important to put more " of a person ' s compensation at risk . " Maybe one year a person stumbles , and then the next year the person who stumbles hits a home run . " For the highest-paid executives , long-term compensation is increasingly being geared to achieving strategic goals . Such plans have customarily relied on stock options , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed price some time in the future . More than 90% of the nation ' s largest companies now offer some type of stock option to their employees . Those options can produce enormous windfalls . One compensation consultant has identified nearly a dozen companies that have made what he calls " mega " option awards during the past few years . These are options or awards of restricted stock worth from $1 million to more than $20 million at the time they are granted . Walt Disney Co. , for example , has given Chairman Michael Eisner options on 816 , 000 shares of company stock at $14. 36 . With Walt Disney stock closing yesterday at $64 , Mr. Eisner has an unrealized gain of about $40. 5 million . He joined the company less than three years ago . " What ( the companies ) are really saying is , ' My CEO is really great , and I want to lock him in . No amount of money is worth losing this guy , ' " says Jude Rich , president of Sibson . But such plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than recognizing individual or corporate performance . Compensation consultants say that other benchmarks for determining long-term payouts , such as gains in per-share earnings or return on equity , are also flawed . " You can milk the company and maximize return on equity but not grow the business , " says Mr. Hourihan , " and I can slash costs and improve earnings per share and not grow the business . " Are there better measures of executive performance ? Alfred Rappoport , a consultant and professor at Northwestern University , thinks he has one : rewarding increases in cash flow . Hillenbrand Industries Inc. , a diversified casket maker in Batesville , Ind. , with annual sales of $641 million , switched to such a measure three years ago . " We think it puts executives in the same ball game with shareholders , " says Tim Layton , vice president of corporate planning . " Divisions that didn ' t contribute to cash-flow growth didn ' t get any long-term compensation , and divisions that did got tremendous long-term compensation . " Over the past four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13% while after-tax cash flow from operations has risen by 22. 5% . In 1985 , when earnings declined by 15% , executives were still happy ; cash flow increased by 16. 5% . Perhaps the biggest resistance to using such measures of performance come from executives themselves . Tying compensation in the form of options to gains in stock price is the most familiar  --  and popular  --  incentive plan among executives . But the process of weaning individuals from their preference for stock options may be helped along by changes in the tax law and proposed regulations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board . With capital-gains treatment eliminated under the new tax law , executives ' gains from incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options will be taxed at the same rate as income . Employers will probably prefer to award nonqualified options ; those permit a company tax deduction , while incentive options , which had been taxed at the lower capital-gains rate , don ' t . Meanwhile , proposed regulations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board , which are expected to be completed this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right now , stock options are accounted for only as stock outstanding with no charge made to earnings . The board ' s regulations would make companies charge to earnings some value for the options when they are given out . No one expects stock options to be abandoned . But the change " levels the playing field " between stock options and other types of long-term compensation , says Mr. Hourihan.  --  - A Glossary of Long-Term Incentive Plans Incentive stock options ( ISO )  --  Executive receives right to purchase stock at stipulated price over specific period of time , in conformance with Internal Revenue Code .
