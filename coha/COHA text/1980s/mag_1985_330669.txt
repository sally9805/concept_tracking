TIME 's cover story this week examines the widespread changes that are taking place in China as it undergoes a " second revolution " under aging , pragmatic Deng Xiaoping . The story was the work of Staff Writer Pico Iyer , aided by Reporter-Researchers Oscar Chiang and Edward Gomez . Reporting for the cover was shared by three men , each of whom brought a very different perspective to the events he observed . <P> Peking Bureau Chief Richard Hornik found particularly valuable his five years of experience as a journalist in the Soviet bloc , including an assignment as TIME 's Eastern Europe bureau chief ( 1981-83 ) . Says Hornik : " That background was really useful as I tried to discern how far its economic reforms have taken China from orthodox Marxism-Leninism . " Stationed in Peking since April , Hornik has traveled widely : to Shanghai twice , to Canton and to Shenzhen , one of China 's foreign trade and export zones . Perhaps his most absorbing trip was to the huge heartland province of Sichuan . Says Hornik : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region that I have been to . Until you see the ageless rice paddies of Sichuan , you can not begin to understand how far China has come , or how far it has to go . " <P> Coping with the bewildering succession of Chinese shifts and reversals has provided some light moments for Peking Reporter Jaime FlorCruz , a Filipino who has lived in China since 1971 . Take dancing : " When I arrived , " he says , " social dancing was taboo . Then in 1978-79 , it was pronounced ' healthy , ' and I found myself waltzing with Chinese women . After that , disco became the craze , and I was often urged to demonstrate it , until last year when it was banned as ' spiritual pollution . ' Now it is In again , but not all the time in all places . Rules here , it seems , are made to be changed . " <P> For Correspondent David Aikman , Peking bureau chief from 1982 until early this year and now a member of TIME 's Washington bureau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country last spring to help report the cover story , Aikman drew on observations that go back to his first visit for TIME in 1972 , as well as on two other lengthy reporting trips in the 1970s . " Like all students of China 's culture , society and politics , I have been at times fascinated , at times saddened by what I have witnessed , " says Aikman . " For me , the most exciting aspect of China 's modernization , despite all the fits and starts , is the intellectual reawakening that has been bubbling away below the surface . It is real testimony to the inherent vigor of the Chinese sense of self . "
