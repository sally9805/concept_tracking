Out of the current political turmoil there is emerging something that seems like a rebuke from the voters to the professional handlers of candidates . The emergence of Loner John Anderson , the firing of Reagan Manager John Sears , the general pruning and realignment of other staffs suggest an effort by candidates to regain some control of themselves in response to mounting skepticism from the folks out there . <P> As they say in the trade , there may have been a little overpackaging . It is no wonder , since the handlers have swelled into the thousands , many of them coming out of the sales and advertising world , where the abiding faith is that almost anything can be sold . Candidates are commodities . <P> In becoming a permanent segment of the service economy , the handlers have naturally acquired many of the traits of any other bureaucracy . As they get more sophisticated , they move from product to product , campaign to campaign . The special sense of mission diminishes , the sense of omnipotence increases , and ultimately a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now include the organizers , fund raisers , pollsters , television counselors , speechwriters and idea men . In the ambitious campaigns , exotic species like voice therapists and hair stylists have joined the ranks . The media members are separate , of course , but necessary to make it all run . The handlers and journalists thus enhance each other . <P> So it was when Sears was cashiered . He came back and held a press conference in the National Press Club , perhaps the first time a campaign factotum was elevated to such status . He had been judged until then almost as much a part of Reagan as Reagan . <P> There always has been a little after-hours jesting among the campaign operatives about their candidates ( " Does he know where he is ? ... Get him his speech ... Ask him to try not to scratch himself in front of the cameras " ) , but in today 's world of intense scrutiny , when a tiny glitch can sink a campaigner , the candidates have become frightened and more dependent than ever on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty years ago , when John Kennedy introduced many of today 's practices , the handlers were a good deal more humble . None of them ever dominated Kennedy , who probably knew more and was tougher than the lot . <P> The experts like Richard Scammon , of the Elections Research Center , fault the decline of the party system for the rising influence of the handlers . The bosses used to pick the candidates , and the party apparatus did the rest . There was established through the party a direction and meaning . Now the contenders have to make their own approach , so they go shopping for the consultants . <P> Austin Ranney , a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , believes that as long as the parties remain weak , the handlers will multiply and as they move from candidate to candidate , they may develop ever more the attitude of horse trainers . <P> There are ominous overtones as we enter the age , at least in the presidency , of what Author Sidney Blumenthal calls the permanent campaign . The men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing , but they are whizzes at campaigning , and so they do it from election to election . Carter 's U.N . vote fumble undoubtedly was enlarged by the panic of political manipulators and Carter 's reliance on them .
