He preaches regularly from the pulpit of a Philadelphia church , but his most noted sermon is a code of conduct for Americans doing business in South Africa . A decade ago , the Rev. Leon Sullivan , a Baptist clergyman and civil rights leader , formulated a set of antiapartheid principles that came to be adopted by a majority of U.S. companies operating in that troubled land . Last week Sullivan called a press conference in Washington to announce a dramatic change in strategy . Because the so-called Sullivan Principles had failed to bring an end to apartheid , he declared , he had concluded that all American firms should leave South Africa and that the Reagan Administration should break its remaining trade and diplomatic ties with that country . <P> Sullivan 's original view had been that U.S. firms were justified in remaining if they stressed desegregation in the workplace , strengthened the training and promotion of black employees and pressed for improvement in black health care , housing and education . Today 127 of the nearly 200 U.S. companies still in business in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe those guidelines have had a major influence on South African society . <P> Sullivan does not . Discouraged by the results of the recent whites-only elections that produced a sharp turn to the right , he concluded that more drastic measures were needed . In addition to demanding the withdrawal of U.S. firms , Sullivan maintained that American companies should stop supplying South Africa with components and should end licensing agreements in that country . The only exceptions , he continued , should be for the news media , philanthropic and education programs and black-owned businesses . <P> In Pretoria , Foreign Minister Roelof ( " Pik " ) Botha declared that South Africa could not " allow itself to be threatened in this way . " The Reagan Administration took milder exception to Sullivan 's announcement , saying that " it is now more important than ever for U.S. firms to stay and work for an end of apartheid . " Several U.S. companies suggested they would continue to follow the Sullivan Principles . Asked whether the guidelines could endure without Sullivan , the clergyman quipped , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sullivan is convinced the government of State President P.W . Botha is " pushing back even the reforms that have been made . " But last week Botha made a symbolic effort to gain black support by visiting the district of Lekoa , whose precincts include the township of Sharpeville . In 1960 police gunned down 69 blacks in Sharpeville when they staged a peaceful demonstration against the pass laws , which were repealed last year . The mayor of Lekoa , Esau Mahlatsi , urged Botha to allow blacks to enter Parliament , while the President in turn asked townspeople to resist " the influence of radicals and fanatics . " Though Botha drew cheers from black crowds during his visit , other blacks were furious at Mahlatsi for letting the white leader in the door . Referring to the mayor 's presentation of " the freedom of Lekoa " to his distinguished visitor , the Sowetan demanded in an editorial , " Does it not strike you as odd that black councilors should be giving away something they do not have  --  freedom ?
