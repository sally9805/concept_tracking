Tucked beneath its belly will be a 2 , 700-pound missile that the United States hopes will smash an Earth-orbiting satellite to smithereens. // As the F-15 streaks more than 11 miles high , it will release the rocket on an intercept course toward an aging US scientific satellite nearing the coast of California . A direct hit would add new fuel to the superpower arms race in space. // // Should the launch take place , it will be the toughest test yet for America ' s new antisatellite , or ASAT , weapon . Some analysts worry the rocket won ' t be up to the job . There have been technical glitches. // Yet a failure would delight many critics . American doves and hawks are clawing one another over the controversial ASAT . Some members of Congress would like to see the whole program scratched , or at least slowed down . President Reagan and the Pentagon , however , have brushed aside criticism and pushed ahead with ASAT at top speed. // Critics charge that a successful ASAT program could launch a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growing array of US and Soviet arms , such as space mines , high-flying interceptor rockets , and laser platforms , will fill the skies. // ASAT supporters counter these concerns by pointing to two stark facts that they consider overriding : ( 1 ) The Soviet Union has an operational , proven ASAT system that could destroy just about any US satellite in low-Earth orbit ; ( 2 ) the US has no such capability. // The situation is intolerable , and the balance must be restored , US officials say. // This is not the first White House to worry about the Soviets ' antisatellite weaponry . President Carter in 1977 first ordered the Air Force to develop the US missile being tested today . The Carter White House explained that a US ASAT was needed to deter the Soviets from using theirs . It was also needed to prod the Soviets into reaching an ASAT treaty with the US . The Reagan White House makes similar points. // But critics charge that Mr. Reagan does not really want a treaty . And they disagree with Pentagon claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty . The Pentagon points to problems with verification and the danger that the Soviets could suddenly pull ahead in technology unless the US kept testing. // The public is watching this dispute through a hazy lens , for the ASAT dispute is shrouded in secrecy . The Soviets don ' t make announcements about their ASAT weapons . And the Pentagon gives out only limited information about the US program . Even so , enough has become public for the man in the street to understand what the experts are fighting about. // At stake are scores of satellites on which the United States and the Soviet Union rely for vital information . The US currently has about 50 military-intelligence satellites on orbit , the Soviets about 100. // Although the US has fewer satellites , it is more dependent on them . For one thing , the US satellites are better . They last far longer than the Soviet models and are much more capable , so the US doesn ' t need as many . Furthermore , the US operates a global military system , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military , centered in the Eurasian landmass , relies more on land-based systems . So satellites are not quite so critical for Moscow. // Each side has satellites that fly in four kinds of orbits . These are low ( below 3 , 000 miles in altitude ) ; elliptical ( a high-low pattern ) ; semi-synchronous ( about 12 , 000 miles from Earth ) ; and geosynchronous ( 22 , 000 miles from Earth ) . Only satellites in low and elliptical orbits are within range of current ASATs. // Of the 50 US military satellites , about 26 could be hit by the Soviet ASAT system . Of the 100 Soviet satellites , between 16 and 32 may be within range of the new American ASAT system. // Some critics of Reagan policy contend that the Soviet ASAT system is a clunker . They point out that many Soviet tests have failed . The Soviet system , in fact , is less flexible than the US system under development . But experts agree that it works well in its limited way. // The Soviet ASAT ' s conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , as much as a Cadillac automobile . It is lofted into orbit by a liquid-fueled rocket based on the old SS-9 ICBM . The Soviet ASAT zooms into space along the path of an oncoming satellite . After one or two orbits , the warhead nears the target satellite and explodes . This throws thousands of pellets toward the target and destroys it. // The Soviets have run 20 ASAT tests with three different techniques . Using radar homing and a flight path that takes two orbits , seven of 10 tests succeeded ; using a pop-up method and radar , two of four tests succeeded ; using infrared homing , all six tests failed. // The US system is different . It relies on an 18-foot , two-stage rocket that is launched by a fighter aircraft . The solid-fuel rocket races toward a point in space on a one-chance intercept mission . In its final phase , it hurls a 35-pound , can-shaped object at the target . The satellite is destroyed simply by the force of the collision. // Today ' s test will determine whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hit anything. // The Soviets threaten to resume testing if the US goes ahead today . US critics of ASAT , meanwhile , would like to see this whole race stopped right now - before either side gets anything even more capable. // The heart of the current dispute lies in differing views of the current Soviet threat. // James Oberg , a spaceflight engineer and author ( six books ) who works on the US shuttle program in Houston , notes that the Soviets have demonstrated high reliability with their radar-based system. // This presents a clear danger for US satellites , he argues . The US relies on an extremely small number ( public estimates range from two to five ) of low-level photo and digital satellites to report on key aspects of Soviet activities . In a matter of a day or so , the Soviets could destroy every one of them , and ' ' blind ' ' US intelligence. // It would take months for the US to replace those satellites . The Soviets can replace theirs in days or weeks. // Critics , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter that the Soviet system is very slow , that it offers no threat to critical satellites at higher levels , and that the ASAT race should be stopped now before it gets out of hand . Further , critics note that the US is developing satellites that have their own defenses , including shields , jamming devices , and maneuverability. // But critics failed this week in their efforts to block the ASAT test with a federal court order . If today ' s test succeeds , the race could be on. // //
