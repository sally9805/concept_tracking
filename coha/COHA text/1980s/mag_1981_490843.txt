Notes and Comment " 1 WAS going through the lobby of the Forty-second Street branch of C.U.N.Y. ? a shortcut  --  when I saw the sign announcing the lecture , " a friend of ours told us . " I was on my way to work . I 'd waited for half an hour on a jam-packed subway platform for a downtown local at Eighty-first Street , then given up and taken a bus . There was an incident on the bus  --  accusations of pickpocketing , denials , tumult , delay  --  so I got off at Fifty-ninth Street and walked the remaining seventeen blocks . A man was running in and out of the traffic , laughing and gesticulating . He almost got hit . It was freezing cold ; the temperature had dropped eight degrees during the night . I had been awakened in the morning by the wind flapping the window shades in my apartment , even though the windows were shut . The night before , I was supposed to go to a movie with a friend , but the friend had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . I went alone . It was a Cinema 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . My movie had n't started . I stood waiting near the candy stand . An usher came up and demanded to know what movie I was waiting for . I told him . ' Wait in the upstairs lounge , ' he ordered . Finally , the movie started . The place was almost empty . A man a few rows ahead kept turning around throughout the movie and staring at me . The film was about how miserable life can be . I went six blocks to a Burger King , sat at a small table . A disturbed-looking youth at the next table was smoking a cigarette . ' Do you have cigarettes ? ' he called to me , as if he had n't . I went home . ' Beware  --  crime on this block is on the increase , ' said a flyer taped to the vestibule wall . I opened my mailbox and found an appalling bill from Con Ed . When I was nearly asleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screech of brakes . Then there was a terrible crash : a solid hit . In the morning , I went to get a paper . The street was full of garbage , blown by the wind . Trash cans were rolling around . The woman running the newsstand screamed at me , accusing me of messing up her stack of papers . I read Ihe paper on the crowded subway platform : toxic wastes were being discovered all over the country , and an increase in city transit fares was predicted . As I walked ( after leaving the bus ) , I passed stores full of glittery awfulness . Finally , after an hour and a half of travel , I reached the C.U.N.Y. lobby , relieved to be approaching my office , and I saw the sign about the lecture . Stressors in the Workplace , ' it said . ' Rm. 1629 . ' " ? New ROBERT HUGHES , who is the author and host of " The Shock of the New , " a public-television series that is currently exploring the subject of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ideas and opinions like a bonfire throwing off sparks . His pronouncements may he mildly unconventional ( " In the nineteenth century , God died and the artists were n't feeling too well , either " ) or illuminating ( " I do n't believe abstract painting is at a dead end , but its possibilities are shrinking at an extraordinary rate . Maybe it 's best that it should embrace its own decorativeness , but this is a long way from the kind of great utopian hopes that Kandinsky , Malevich , and Mondrian had for it " ) or impishly McLuhanesque ( " Ours is the culture of the electronic fragment " ) . His forum is an electronically fragmented series of eight programs which examines what has been happening in the fine arts during the last hundred years , and his purpose is to persuade the audience to reevaluate the rather uncritical acceptance of modern art which has been encouraged in the classroom as well as in the marketplace . We encountered Mr. Hughes the other day in the midst of a large , cheerful party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu included snippets from the programs , shown on television monitors ; a brief speech thanking Exxon , which is one of the sponsors ; and a splendid dinner of cold salmon , curried chicken , and cucumber salad  --  and can report that he is a solidly built Australian in his early forties with unruly blond hair , a round , ruddy face , penetrating green eyes , and a breezy manner . After dinner , we asked Mr. Hughes if the series had been built around an over-all theme , and he replied that the basic idea was to treat modern art as art of a finite historical period . " My feeling is that modernism is not an eternal phenomenon , like Mao 's fantasy of the perpetual revolution , but represents a closed historical period , like the Italian Renaissance , " he said . " Now , we ca n't say that the Renaissance finished at 10 A.M. on a Tuesday in December of 1546 , but we can point out that its energies petered out at about that time and that many of its forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with in much the same way . You can see the orchestra tuning up with Courbet , in the eighteen-fifties , and you can watch the original motive power run- ning out more than a hundred years later . People are still producing marvellous paintings and sculptures , but that terrific sparkling quality  --  that sense of really heroic possibilities  --  has disappeared . I remember feeling a bit nervous about this thesis at first , because modernism has become our official culture . There are colossal investments in galleries , in educational structures , in museums  --  and all this is predicated on the idea that there is a continuous historical movement into the future called modernism and that New York is leading the way . Another problem is to try to get a feeling of historical distance from the early years of modern art . Museums make us think that art inhabits a perpetual present , but remember when you look at those early Cubist Braques and Picassos that the women who saw them first were wearing hobble skirts . " We asked Mr. Hughes how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas was thematic , because so many of the things that happened in twentieth-century art happened simultaneously . " I begin with the Eiffel Tower , the most vivid and completely gratuitous social image of modernity in France at the turn of the century , " he said , " and go on to raise the question ' What did the artists of the eighteen-nineties mean when they talked about themselves as " des gems modernes " ? ' At that time , the modernist image was part of the idea of progress ; it anticipated a new heaven and a new earth , and it was indissolubly linked with the idea of the good machine that would transform all the conditions of life . There was also a strong aspect of millenarian reformism around 1900 : artists felt that if they made a different kind of building , painted a different kind of picture , conceived a new language of sculpture , grace would descend upon us . I try to explain how they felt by showing a cluster of images that explore the connections between Cubism  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroically optimistic new world . Braque and Picasso , for example , were positively enraptured by the millenarian possibilities of a new age based on flight , rapid transit , and the idea of a relativistic universe . They even thought of themselves as the Wright brothers : Picasso 's pet name for Braque was Wilbour , ' and in several of his 1911 and 1912 Cubist paintings he inscribed the phrase ' Notre avenir eat dans " " How long did this euphoria last ? " we inquired . " Until the First World War , " replied Mr. Hughes . " Which is what the second program is about . The war created a great crack in confidence for every sensitive and cultivated person in Europe . It killed the myth of the good machine , and it revealed the same catastrophic split between official language and actual experience which America later underwent in Vietnam . The results included the Weimar culture , a recoil from idealism to absolute objectivity , German Dadaism , the anarchic distrust of political structures which you get in people like Grosz and flOch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political architecture that was produced by both left and right . Program Three shows how a series of artists  --  among them Cezanne , Picasso , Matisse , the Fauves ? constructed wonderful landscapes of ordered pleasure within the master image of the Mediterranean . Four deals with the Bauhaus and the utopian strain in modern architecture  --  hopes that ended up in the rubble of Brasilia . Five concentrates on Surrealism and its effect in America . Six is the grace-and-terror one . It begins with van Gogh and Munch , deals with German Expressionism and American Abstract Expressionism , and ends with people like Francis Bacon . Seven , which is called ' Culture as Nature , ' is about the intrusion of the manufactured urban landscape into art , and deals with the effect that television and print have had on painting . It starts with the Pop element in Cubism  --  the desire to make icons of the cheap , mass-produced world  --  and goes through artists like Stuart Davis , Rauschenberg , Johns , Rosenquist , Oldenburg , and Warhol . Pop Art has completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was an attempt to bring mass culture and the high diction of art together into a sort of demotic style . Eight is a summing up and a rather pessimistic look at the future . " " Why pessimistic ? " we asked . " Because art is no longer the repository of idealism , the way it was at the beginning of the century , " Mr. Hughes replied . " We live in a deeply pessimistic society , which has pretty much Iost its faith in the ability of art to embody religious or highly philosophical states of mind . And I see no end to JANUARY 26.1981 the trivialization of works of art by the marketing process . I see no end to the fetishization of ' masterpieces ' in museums for an increasingly large public . Works of art today are judged successful in terms of their celebrity . But celebrity is not a reward for manifest deeds ; it 's a condition of being famous for being famous . What supplies the fame and primes the pump is money . The social agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a work of art  --  its ability to combine with other molecules coming in from society  --  and removes it to a plateau of imperishable and useless fantasy . It celebrates nothing . There are two ideas that are fundamental to the entire century of what we call modern art . The first is an acute consciousness of the semantics of your craft , of the formal properties of the art you 're practicing  --  which formal properties to some extent become the subject matter of the work . The second is the great modernist hope that art could revive the world , could bring justice , harmony , and reason to social transactions . It 's on the first idea that modernism really succeeded , and it 's on the second that , having produced its great works , it failed . Because it did n't give us a better world . It gave us a slightly different world . " Tableware JUST before she left the house the other morning , said Letitia Baldridge , who has revised and expanded " The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband said to her , " My God ! Who would want to hear you at this hour ? " Miss Baldridge , a large , pink-faced woman , said this with such comic skill that the whole roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers laughed extremely hard . Miss Baldridge told them that she went to Vassar , and received a B.A. , but the funny thing about going to college was that when she graduated she could n't type , she could n't take shorthand , and she could n't file . The roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers let that pass . Then , said Miss Baldridge , she went to work for Ambassador David Bruce and his wife , Evangeline , at the United States Embassy in Paris . Evangeline Bruce , she said , was an incredible woman , who could speak seven languages by the time she was seventeen , cared very much about how a THE NEW YOR.KER. table looked , and would always take care of the table setting herself . But then once , for some reason or other , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by herself . At this particular dinner , there were more men than women , so some of the men had to be seated next to each other . Well , when they all sat down , it turned out that Miss Baldridge had seated one of the top ambassadors next to his wife 's lover , and , because the ambassador and his wife and his wife 's lover were an open secret , everybody at the dinner almost passed out . And so did the roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers ; again they laughed extremely hard . When something like this happens , she said , you do n't cry about it , because then it only gets worse . After that , she told about working for Amhassadress Clare Boothe Luce , in Italy . This was soon after the Second World War , and what an experience that was ! The Italians were so baroque , the dollar was tops , and the Luces were wonderful . Miss Baldridge , on the other hand , had her problems . There was the time she introduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador . That did n't go down too well with the Pakistani Ambassador , naturally , but it got a big laugh from the roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers . And the time when , for the first dinner she organized , everything was white  --  everything : the dishes , the soup , the wine . It was n't funny then , but it got a big laugh now . And the time she served some Mormons a dinner they could n't eat : the soup had sherry in it , and the fish had been cooked in white wine , the meat in red wine , the dessert in cognac . It was n't funny then , but it was sidesplitting now . Winding up , Miss Baldridge told about working for Tiffany 's , and how once , for a display , she ordered some exotic birds , and how they escaped from their cage , causing near-havoc on the third floor , which was filled with fine crystal and china . For that , the roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers had lots of sharp intakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House for Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy , and what a great decorator and restorer Mrs. Kennedy was , and how conscious of the tableware she was . The roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers emitted some " Ales . Then Miss Baldridge said that it was a wonderful world and an affirmative world , and the roomful of tableware manufacturers and merchandisers applauded wildly , as if they were surprised and grateful that someone could feel that way after a life filled with table settings . Bookstore T only bookstore in New York specializing in architectural subjects opened several weeks ago in the north wing of the Villard Houses , on Madison Avenue between Fiftieth and Fifty-first Streets , and it would be difficult to think of a more appropriate spot . The Houses , which date from 1882 , were designed by the firm of McKim , Mead &; White for the railroad entrepreneur Henry Villard , and they are among the finest examples of nineteenth-century Italianate architecture anywhere . Over the years , the Houses have had many functions , and most recently have been incorporated into the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , meeting rooms , part of the lobby , and the main entrance . The bulk of the hotel is a tall dark-brown tower just east of the Houses . There were originally six Villard Houses ( only three remain , because the interiors of two were merged in the nineteen-twenties , and the interiors of two more were dismantled when the hotel was built ) , and they were joined so that the entire structure would appear from the outside to be a seamless Renaissance palazzo . After the Houses had been used as private residences for many years , they became at various times the headquarters of the Women 's Military Service Club Center , of the Friends of Free France , of Random House , of Capital Cities Communications , and of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York . ( The Archdiocese has leased the Houses to the Helmsley organization on a long-term basis . ) In 1968 , the Villard Houses were declared a New York City landmark . The structure consists of a central section and two wings , bordering a three-sided courtyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the south wing are both being used for hotel purposes , the north wing has now been designated the Urban Center  --  a brand-new creation of the Municipal Art Society ( which has subleased that wing from the Helmsley people ) . In this new role , the north wing will serve as the headquarters not only of the Society but also of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects , the New York chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects , the Architectural League of New York , and the Parks Council . The bookstore , which is another creation of the Municipal Art Society , and is called Urban Center Books , is situated on what is known as the parlor floor , in what ? ? was once a reception room , and overlooks the courtyard . We went up to Urban Center Books the other afternoon to see how things were going . Seated at a desk just inside the room  --  it has high windows , foliate cornices , and a large mirror over a fireplace  --  was the store 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a blond mustache and a ready smile , who was formerly the manager of the bookstore in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and he spoke with enthusiasm about the new bookstore 's prospects . " So far , we 're doing a lot better than we expected , " Mr. Frazier told us . " We thought that New York could support someth ing like this , but you can never be sure until you try . The idea of a bookstore came from Joan K. Davidson , the president of the J. M. Kaplan Fund , and the fund subsequently donated something over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to help establish the store . Although Urban Center Books is being operated by the Municipal Art Society , which is nonprofit , it is expected to he self-sustaining . Anyway , we have about fourteen hundred titles on our shelves now , and we expect to add more . We see this as an issue-oriented store supporting programs and activities of the various JANUARY 26 , 1981 organizations here , but we think that our focus should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to wait on a customer  --  a woman who wanted to see something on post-modern architecture  --  and we walked over to a row of racks against a wall and glanced at some posters and maps . Then we took a look at a table covered with books . They included " Life in the English Country House , " by Mark Girouard ; " Cities of the American West , " by John W. Reps ; " Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance , " by John McAndrew ; " Architecture in the Seventies , " by Udo Kultermann ; and " Twentieth Century Furniture , " by Philippe Garner . On another table we saw some yellowing monographs , including one on doorways which had been published in New York in 1921 as part of a series on architectural subjects called the White Pine series . When Mr. Frazier returned to his desk , we asked him to what extent Urban Center Books would deal in early and out-of-print works . " That kind of thing will undoubtedly become more important as we grow , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large volume with a faded green binding . " This is a first edition of John Ruskin 's ' The Poetry of Architecture , ' published in London in 1893 . Gradually , we 'll be acquiring more things like this . So far , our major buying decisions have involved current titles , and , fortunately , we have a first-rate board of advisers helping us make our choices . And even though we 're tucked away here in the north wing , without a sign outside , a remarkable number of people have been finding the bookstore and coming in to browse . I have a hunch we 'll be getting quite a lot of international business , too . The other day , for instance , a couple from Mexico came in to look around . They were staying in the neighborhood , and they THE NEW YORKER. said they had never heard of our shop . They sort of wandered in . Well , by the time they left they had bought three hundred dollars ' worth of books . We seem to be filling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Mel Davis gave a few unsettling cries of anguish about his profession the other day while he worked  --  in his establishment , a cozy , warm , tidy place on East Forty-ninth Street near the East River  --  on a tenyear-old small miniature apricot poodle named Goldie , who stood on a grooming table as though transfixed by the shop 's windows , which were opaque with steam against the icy blasts outside . " I 'm so upset about what 's happening with dogs , " said Mr. Davis , who is , as half the poodle owners in town know , a small , faithful , puppylike man , with a small , faithful , puppylike face , who believes that every dog has the right to look naturally beautiful , and who measures all people by the way they recognize that right . Wearing pastel-green slacks and a gaudy flower-patterned sports shirt open at the collar , Mr. Davis sat on a bar stool , his heels hooked over the top rung , and clipped away at Goldie 's fluff , shaping a kind of halo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out on the street and see the way dogs look , I feel so depressed , " Mr. Davis said . " All around me , I see long , low dogs with haircuts shaped to make them look like walking coffee tables . Short-backed dogs look as though their heads were pushed up against their behinds . Has mass production reached the point now where all dogs are made to look alike , no matter what the breed , and with no artistry and no styling ? I know it 's been happening with books and with clothes and with television programs and with movies and with medical doctors and with politicians and with the faces of people . But dogs ! " Goldie gave Mr. Davis a look of sympathetic gloom . " Do n't the owners see the travesties that are made of their dogs ? " Mr. Davis asked . " Do n't they see how badly their dogs are patterned ? I feel so sorry for the dogs  --  and for the owners , too . I see so many shaved bodies , with full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog look so unbalanced , as though he came out of a barber school on the Bowery . Can you imagine schnauzers and other terriers not being made to look like the precisely tailored creatures they should be ? The other day , I met a woman whose schnauzer looked like a poodle . She did n't know how her dog should look . But the dog knew . He came to us so unhappy . Well , we did a complete restyling . The dog looked so serene , and the woman was hysterical with joy . " Goldie wagged her tail . " Who knows or cares these days about how to enhance the personality or conformation of the dog ? " Mr. Davis asked . " The trouble is , first of all , with the grooming schools . They appeal to the students to learn and to go out fast and earn a living in grooming . The students are dog lovers , and are sincere in their efforts . But how much can they learn in a crash course in a few months ? Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place ? We interview and audition quite a few of these graduates , but we rarely find anybody with real talent . We try to encourage the youngsters to start at the bottom , doing rough clipping , washing , drying , and brushing , and leave the styling to our talented groomers  --  at least , until the youngsters learn something . But no , these youngsters want to start immediately at the top . Their attitude is , once they are graduates they are immediately qualified to do it all . " " Sounds familiar , " we said . " To commercialize an artistic profession is to me an outrage , " Mr. Davis went on . " Our clients are very fussy . When we have a new client , at first we observe the animal and suggest the correct cut . Sortie of these cuts are very intricate and require more than
