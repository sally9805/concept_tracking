 | think they just might want to come back someday and find more than ashes . They did n't command us not to fire atomic weapons , by the way . I guess they knew by that time that when a god commands Do n't Eat Those Apples , or Do n't Open This Box  --  it 's the first thing men 'll do . ( And manage to blame it on a woman , too , if you 'll notice . But I digress . ) No , they just said , " We fixed that . " Maybe the Russians have found out what they did by this time . Or the Israelis . What 's left of the Pentagon is too scared to try . So , Hello , Posterity . This is about what really happened , to add to the White Book , if you ever find one  --  Oops , that was a rat . I have a Coleman lantern , and a hockey stick for the rats . Start with First Contact . First Contact took place on Mars , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had landed , that is . The command module pilot , Reverend Perry Danforth , was just flying orbits , looking down and seeing peculiar things . Meeting them on Mars confused everybody for a while . They were not Martians . The best account of the meeting is from Mission Control . I found a man who had been a boy there , sort of a gofer . In that big room with all the terminals , you 've seen it a million times on TV if you watched space stuff . So this first bit is dictated live by Kevin ( " Red " ) Blake , now aged 99.5 years . But before him I want to say a word about how everything was . So normal . Nothing sinister or dramatic going on . Like in a ship that 's slowly , very slowly listing to one side , only nobody 's mentioning it . That 's all underneath . But little things give it away , like this one Kevin told me before they landed : It was a long trip , see , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called Mars Eagle . James Aruppa , commanding , and Todd Fiske , and the Reverend Perry , who was n't going to get to land . ( Personally I 'd have broken Todd 's arm or something , if I 'd been Perry , so I could get to land . Imagine getting so close  --  and then flying circles for a week while the others are on Mars ! But he acted perfectly happy about it . He  | even made a joke about being " the most expensive valet parking service ever . " Very cooperative and one-for-all , the Reverend . I never did find out exactly what he was the Reverend of , maybe it was only a nickname . ) Anyway about five or six months out , at a time when they were supposed to be fast asleep , they called Mission Control . " Are you all right back there ? " " Sure , everything 's nominal here . What 's with you ? " Well , it turned out that they 'd seen this flash , some trick rock reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth was . And they thought it was missiles , see , World War III starting . . . anybody would 've , in those days . That 's what I mean by the feelings just underneath . But nobody ever said a gloomy word , on top . There were other things underneath , of course , different for different people , all adding up to The End . But this is no place to talk about the old days , it 's all changed now . So that 's that , and now here comes Kevin : " I can remember it like it was yesterday . All morning had been occupied with the Lander carrying Todd and Jim Aruppa , coming down and finding a flat place . I nearly got thrown out of the control room for sticking my head in people 's way to catch a glimpse of a screen while I was bringing stuff . The amount of coffee those NASA boys put away ! And some of them ate , one man ate seven egg sandwiches , they were all keyed up like crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know what you want to hear . " So by then it was coming pitch-dark on Mars , only the Lander 's lights glaring on a pebbly plain with cracks in it . The computer colored it red , I guess it was . Mission Control would n't let them get out then . They were ordered to sleep until it got full light again . Ten hours . . . imagine , sleeping your first night on Mars ! " The last thing was , Perry up in the command module reported a glow of light on the eastern horizon . It was n't a moon rising  --  we 'd already seen one of those . A little greenish crescent , going like crazy .  | " So during the night Perry was supposed to check on what might be glowing toward the east  --  a volcano , maybe ? But by the time he came around to where he could see the place again , the glow had faded to nearly nothing , and next trip there was nothing at all to see . " At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control , but every so often one of the men who were supposed to be sleeping in their quarters next door would come in and just stare at the screens for a few minutes . All you could see was a faint , jagged horizon-line , and then the stars began . " First light was supposed to be at five-fifty A.M. our time ? ( see , I even remember numbers ! ) ? and by that time the whole day crew was back in the room , everybody all mixed together , and all wanting coffee and danishes . " On the screens the sky was getting just a little lighter , so the horizon looked sharper and darker until suddenly a faint lightness came on the ground plain in front of the mountains . And then came a minute I 'll never forget . Like the whole room was holding its breath , only whispering or rustling a little around their dark screens . And then Eggy Stone yelled out loud and clear : " There 's something there ! It 's big ! Oh , man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones thought they 'd been picking up but could n't believe , and everybody was jabbering at once . And the voices of the astronauts cutting through everything , with that four-and-a-half-minute lag , about how this Thing was sitting in front of them unlit , unmoving , no indication of how it had come there , whether it crawled or flew in or bored up out of the ground . Of course , they thought it was Martians . " What it was was a great big , say fifty-meter-long , dumbbell shape lying there about a hundred meters in front of their main window . It was two huge spheroids , or hexa-somethings , connected by one big fat center bar  --  really like a dumbbell . Only in the middle of the connection was a chamber , say three meters each way . We could see right in because its whole front side was  | folded back like a big gull-wing door . It appeared to be padded inside . The computer called it light blue , with two rust-colored lumps like cushion seats back on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ends had like windows spaced all around them . " And filling the window of the end nearest us , the window we could see into , was something moving or flickering slightly , something shiny and lighter blue . It took a second or two to recognize it , because of its size  --  it was over a meter long , almost round . " It was an eye . A great , humongous , living eye , blue with a white rim . And looking at us . " Like the creature it belonged to was so big it was all curled up inside its compartment , with its eye pressed to the glass . For some reason , right from the start we knew that the creature , or being , or whatever , had only one central eye . " In addition to looking at us  --  that is , at the camera , most of the time  --  the eye was also swiveling to examine the Lander and everything around . " Now all through the excitement Todd and Jim in the Lander were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , but whenever I could get near Voice Contact I heard things like , We are not crazy ! I tell you we are not crazy , it 's talking in our heads . Yes , in English . We get two words very distinctly : Peace and Welcome . Over and over . And we are not out of our minds , if I could figure a way to get this on the caller you 'd hear ? ' " They sounded madder and madder , I guess Mission Control was giving them a hard time , especially General Streiter who was sure it was a Soviet Commie trick of some kind . And of course there was no way for them to get a mental voice on the antennae . But then the aliens apparently solved that for themselves . Just as Jim was saying for the tenth time that he was n't crazy or had n't drunk too much coffee , all our communications went blooie for a minute and then this great big quiet voice drowned everything . " PEACE . . . ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the voice , its tone , made Mission 5  | Control sound for a minute like a  --  well , like a cathedral . PEACE ! . . . WELCOME ! . . . PEACE . . . FRIENDS .. ' " And then it added , very gentle and majestic , COME . . . COME ... ' " And Mission Control became aware that Todd and Jim were preparing to go out of the Lander . " Pandemonium ! " Well , I 'll skip all this bit where Mission Control was ordering them to stay inside , on no account to even put a hand out , to unsuit  --  Jim and Todd were calmly suiting up  --  and anything else they could think of and General Streiter ordering courtmartials for everybody in sight , on Mars or Earth  --  it even went so far as getting the President out of bed to come and countermand them in person . I found out afterwards that the poor man got so mixed up he thought they were refusing to go out onto Mars , and he was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lag , and this great hushy voice blanking everything out with PEACE . . . WELCOME .. " Until finally it was obvious even to the general that nothing could be done , that forty-four million miles away two Earthmen were about to walk out onto Mars and confront The Alien . " ( This is Theodora putting in a word here , see , everyone had been so convinced that there was no life on Mars above something like lichen that absolutely no instructions had been thought up for meeting large-scale sentient life , let alone with telepathic communications . ) " Well , they evacuated the air , and as they went to go down the ladder , Jim Aruppa grabbed Todd , and we could hear him saying in his helmet , Remember , you bastard ! Count cadence , now ! ' " And nobody knew what that was until we found out there 'd been this private arrangement between the two men . After all those months together , see , Jim was n't going to take all the glory for being the First Man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the second man to step onto the Moon ? ' And Todd had to guess  | twice , and nobody else knew either . And Jim was n't going to let that happen again . So he ordered Todd to descend in synch with him and make an absolutely simultaneous first-foot-down . That was one of the little squabbles that kept Mission Control lively all those two years . Some kind of guy , Jim . " So there they were counting cadence down the ladder to Mars  --  to Mars , man ! ? with this alien Thing a hundred yards away staring at them . " And they walked over to it slowly and carefully , looking at everything , the eye following them . And there were no signs of how it had possibly moved there except by some kind of very gentle flight . But no machinery , nothing at all but these two big hexagonal spheroids with windows . And the compartment between . The first word Jim sent back was , It seems to be entirely non-metallic . Not plastic , either . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with windows set in . The frames are non-metallic too . ' " And then they got to where they could see the windows on the farther-off spheroid  --  and there was another eye looking out at them from it ! " It seemed exactly like the first eye , only slightly larger and paler . The flesh around the eyes registered blue too , by the way  --  and there was no sign of eyelashes . " And then both Jim and Todd claimed that this eye winked at them and Mission Control went back to calling them crazy . " When they got back in front , by the open compartment , they made signals as though they were hearing something . And then the voice we could hear via radio changed too . Come , ' it said in sort of grand-friendly tones . Come . . . Please come in . Come with . Say hello friends . ' " Well , that sent Mission Control into a new spasm of countercommands , in the midst of which the two men set the camera on its tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing a little on the padded floor . Then they turned around to face us , and sat down on the seat-cushionlooking things . And at that the big overhead door slid smoothly 7  | forward and down and closed them in . It had a window in it  --  in fact it was mostly window . But before anybody could think of any reaction to that , it opened up again halfway , and Todd and Jim stepped out . Four and a half minutes later we heard , They say to bring food for one day . ' " And the men went back up into the Lander to collect supplies . " Somehow the ordinariness , or what you might call considerateness , of this just took the wind out of a lot of angry lungs . " No water necessary , they say , ' Jim Aruppa told us as they climbed back out of the Lander . But we brought some just in case . I never thought I 'd be glad to see a can of Tab , ' he grinned , holding up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands in it . ' " Jeez , it 's getting like a god-forsaken picnic ! ' Eggy Stone shouted over the general uproar . " Well , the door snapped over and shut down again . We could see them through the window , waving . And then the thing simply lifted up quietly and flew like magic toward and over the camera , and over the Lander , and we could n't pick it up again . And that was absolutely all for thirty-six long hours , until " ? Say , Miz Tanton , have n't you got the tape of what they said when they came back ? I just ca n't talk one word more . " So here 's a break . All this next part I put together from Jim and Todd 's report-tapes of their trip , plus the officially cleanedup version of it that was in the Times . I found a stack of archive tape dupes in the janitor 's cubby . But before that , I should say that the Reverend Perry had been busy , up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would take orders , and they 'd told him to try to check out where the Thing had come from during the night . So he got busy with his ' scopes and sensors , and about the time Jim and Todd were going back for their chow , he had a report . A Martian building , or structure , " like a big mound of bubbles " was located in the foothills of Mount Eleuthera to the east . But as a city it was strange  --  it had no suburbs , no streets , not much  | internal differentiation , and no roads leading to or away . ( Of course not , we know now it was a ship . ) So when the flying dumbbell bearing the two Humans went off NASA 's cameras , Perry knew where to try to pick them up . And by the way , although Perry was obedient to orders , he too was acting strange . He did n't volunteer anything , but on direct questioning he admitted that he was hearing voices in his head  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears " ? and when the aliens ' voices cut in on the radio wavelength , Perry pulled himself down to his knees and NASA could see enough to realize he was trying to both pray and weep . This did n't disturb them overmuch  --  considering what else was going on  --  because the Reverend was known to indulge in short prayers whenever some special marvel of space came up , and he was addicted to brief thanksgivings at any lucky break . He was quite unself-conscious about this , and it never interfered with his efficiency , so maybe NASA figured they were covering all bets by having him along . General Streiter asked him if he was all right . " I shall say no more about this now , General , " Perry replied . " I recognize it is inappropriate to this phase of our mission . But I sincerely believe we have contacted a . . . a Higher Power , and that some very great good may come of this if we prove worthy . " Streiter took this in silence ; he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected him to see Red skulduggery in the sudden materialization of the Thing . But Perry seemed to be taking another tack ; the general respected him enough to let him be . So back to Todd and Jim who were being flown silently , magically , over the Martian landscape . They were at the big door-window . The lift-off was so gentle that Jim said he would n't have known they were moving if he had n't been looking out . This reassured them about the absence of any straps or body-holds in the padded compartment they had entered . They were of course looking for a city or town , or at least the openings of tunnels , and the " mound of bubbles " Perry was 9  | reporting took them by surprise . Near the top of the mound was an opening where a sphere or two seemed to be missing ; as they came over it , they saw that their craft exactly fitted in . Forward motion ceased quietly , and with a soft , non-metallic brushing sound the modules that carried them dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , that 's all one huge ship  --  and this is a dinghy ! " His mind had broadcast the right picture ; " Yess ! " the aliens chorused , " Our ship ! " Before they could see anything of the interior , a side window in their compartment opened , and a light-blue , leathery-looking trunk or tentacle about the size of a fire hose appeared . " Hello ! " said the voice in their heads clearly . " Hello , " they said aloud . The tentacle extended itself towards Jim 's hand . Involuntarily he drew back . " Hello ? Hello ? Friends ! " said the soundless voice . " Touch ? " Gingerly Jim extended his hand , and to his surprise , after a little confusion , the contact the alien wanted was achieved . " It wants to shake hands ! " Jim exclaimed to Todd . " Yes ! Friends ! Shake ! " And a similar window in the opposite wall opened , revealing the other alien . Its tentacle was larger , more wrinkled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic hand-shaking ensued . Then the second alien wanted something more . Its tentacle 's tip pulled clumsily but gently at Todd 's glove , and he got a confused message about taking it off and speaking . When Todd got his glove off and took the alien 's flesh bare-handed , he gasped and seemed to stagger . " What 's wrong ? Todd ? " " Okay  --  it 's okay , very  --  try it . " Jim ungloved and grasped the tip of the alien limb . Then he too gasped  --  as contact occurred , there came with it a rush of communication , both verbal and pictorial , in which he could pick out bits or sequences of past events , present communication , speculations , images  --  including a vision of himself ? plans , questions  --  he was all but inside an alien mind !  | They were both laughing , delighted at this immense novelty to explore  --  and from the other sides of their padded walls came echoing chuckles . A pleasant fragrance like cinnamon was coming through their air filters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spicy odor emitted by these aliens when excited and interested . " This is going to take practice , " Jim gasped . He tried to convey the idea to the alien whose blue tentacle he was clasping , and received a strong feeling of assent . Delicately , it moved its tentacle within his grip , so that only certain surfaces were apposed , and the rush of mindflow quieted down . Then it tapped his palm in a way that they soon came to recognize as meaning " I have something to tell/show you . " And he found himself seeing a connected , coherent " movie " of the alien 's bubble-craft approaching Earth sometime earlier , sampling the airborne communications  --  both radio and video ? and selecting the large landmass of North America to linger near . " All same language , " said the voice in his head . " Many pictures  --  teach much . " And then a sample of what they had set themselves to learn  --  recognizable segments of Dallas , All My Children , Sesame Street , newscasts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not understand . " Whew ! Jim tried to interrupt , but the flow went on . From it he gathered that the aliens had evoked a few hostile reactions from US Air Force installations . Also the aliens soon learned that great intergroup hostilities existed on Earth . They had actually been on the verge of leaving ? " Go look better planet " ? when they learned about the Mars mission . It seemed to them that this would be the ideal place and way to meet Humanity . So here they were , and here were our two astronauts  --  deep in converse , without having seen the forms or faces of their new friends . ( For from the start , there had seemed to both men no question that a friendly meeting was in progress , and friendship was growing between them every moment . ) " Now you want say Hello others , so we talk more ? " " Yes indeed . " 11  | A picture-sequence in their minds prepared them and then the whole back wall of their compartment irised open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they went to it they saw that the " mound of bubbles " was actually a shell around an open core ; all the " bubbles " gave onto a common open space , in which were a few structures whose use or meaning they could n't guess . All around the walls , ceiling , floor were the openings of compartments similar to their own , some brightly lighted , some dim , some dark , so that the whole formed a kind of grand auditorium or meeting hall . At the mouth of nearly every individual compartment was an alien , or two or more , all with their great single eyes turned eagerly in their direction . And here I have to pause , or put in asterisks or somehow prepare you before I describe what you notice I 've omitted so far  --  the aliens ' shapes . The color of course you know  --  sky-blue in the main , with here and there blues lighter or darker , from slate to peacock blue , from pale blue foam to deep marine . And the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the tentacles you have met  --  each had groups of sucker-discs which were apparently quiescent unless the owner wished to cling . It is their general shape you do n't yet know . There is one , and only one , earthly animal that they resembled , and they resembled it very closely . To put it bluntly , the aliens looked like gigantic cerulean octopuses . Image-wise , of course , it was terrible . In addition to being unspellable ( octopuses , octopusses , octopoi , octopi , octopodes ? ) , it conjured up every old horror cliche . And it was undeniable  --  they were in fact simply big air-breathing octopuses ; we all learned later that they had evolved in their planet 's oceans , and slowly adapted to land as their oceans dried . Their mantles had lost the propulsive function , and four of their back tentacles had evolved to limbs suitable for walking on land , leaving the other four to take on hand-and-arm and telepathic transmission abilities . Their heads were large and bald and shiny above the single  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , concealing their noses and mouths , or beaks , or whatever . Also to be glimpsed beneath the mantle 's rippling edges was a mass of darker blue fur-like organs , among which seemed to be some very small , delicate tentacles of unknown use . In all , had it not been for their truly lovely coloring and odor and the expressive friendliness of their large eyes , the first impression of the aliens to a Human , would have to be revulsion bordering on terror . The Earthly media of course went wild at first  --  GIANT BLUE OCTOPUSES ON MARS ! shrilled even the staidest . Octopus ! ? the name alone makes for the world 's worst PR . That 's why I 've given you all this preliminary stuff , instead of just dictating from the newsclips . The photos , when they came , made things a little better , because their postures were so versatile and graceful . And their basically radial bodies were obviously in transition to a bilaterally symmetrical form  --  the four " back " leg-tentacles were much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact if  --  as happened later  --  a small one wore a long robe with a hood to conceal the shiny bald dome above the eye , it could pass for a large , somewhat top-heavy human form . And they spent much of their time thus upright , looking rather like multiply-armed Indian deities , and smelling delightful . So that , as soon as Earth saw more of them , the original " Sci-Fi " horror images were seen to be ludicrously inappropriate , and forgotten . While Todd and Jim were taking in the nature of their audience , and vice versa , their new friends were folding back the walls of their compartments and dragging the cushions to the edge of the front . " We speak one-to-all like this . We show you . " And they motioned Todd and Jim to take seats . " No fear fall off , everybody catch . " Then they stationed themselves on each side , laid their transmission-tentacles across Jim and Todd 's shoulders , and seemed to listen . 13  | " No  --  clothes too thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So the men first gingerly lifted off their helmets  --  getting a real blast of carnation scent  --  and then started peeling down . They felt a bit odd about it in front of all those eager eyes , but what the hell , their bodies were no more to the aliens than a wombat 's to them . So they sat back down again , nude , and the tentacles came back . " Ahhh ! Good ! " And with that the two big aliens stretched their other transmitter arms out to the aliens in the compartments next door , and these did the same to those around them , so that in a minute the whole great amphitheatre was intricately laced together , with the men as foci . While this was happening , Todd felt a plucking at his shins . He looked down , and there was this dark-blue tentacle coming up at him from the compartment below . He heard , or sensed , what could only be a giggle , and next instant three big round bright eyes were staring up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fume of interest wafted up . The alien next to him emitted a reproving sound , and batted at the eyes with a spare limb . " Young ones ! " Peering down , Todd and Jim saw a cluster of smaller aliens in the chamber below , evidently trying to get in on the network by short-circuit . " It 's okay . " He grinned . " No problem to us . " So their two big friends let the little fellows sneak tendrils in to touch the men 's legs and feet . " Okay . . . You go first ? " said the one next to Jim . " Oh , wait  --  Us name Angli . An-gli , " it repeated aloud . " You name ? " " Hello , Angli ! " said Jim to them both . " Us name Hu-mans . But " ? he pointed at the other ? " You have special personal name , for you only ? " Well , that was their introduction to the one great difficulty of mind-speech  --  asking questions . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even so they were n't sure they had it right . Jim said , " The customary thing here seems to be to call up a quick flash-image of the person , or his eye , or something special about him or her . I do n't think verbal names are used  | much . But our friends seem to be something like Urizel and Azazel , for what it 's worth . We 'll try calling them that and see if it works . " Then he put his arm around Todd . " We together , Hu-mans , " he said . " But he alone " ? gesturing ? " is Todd . I  --  me , here  --  am Jim . Todd . . . Jim . Jim . . . Todd . Get it ? " " Me Jane , you Tarzan , " muttered Todd . " Shut up , you idiot , this is no time to clown . . . We 'll have to be sure somehow that they know what a joke is . . . All right . Urizel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you want to know about us Humans first ? " And so started the greatest show-and-tell anthropology class of their lives . Surprisingly soon , it got itself organized with their two friends alternately passing questions to the men . Not surprisingly , in view of their TV fare , the first queries were mainly about economics . Todd had the pleasure of trying to answer , " What is money ' ? " He managed to form a picture of a medium of exchange passing from hand to hand in the Human world . And luckily the Angli seemed to have something to relate this to ; Jim got a visual image of furry brown creatures carrying on their tails stacks of big square things with holes in them , that had to be clumsy coins . " Gosh , what does a really rich one do ? " Todd did n't expect an answer , but the Angli had picked up the drift of his query , and he got a clear mental picture of a pompous-looking brown alien followed by a formal train of specialized coin-bearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with big discs . Both Humans and Angli laughed . " What do you do with money ' ? " Azazel asked . Jim gulped and tried to visualize a bank teller , vaults , checkbooks . " I fear I 'm not doing justice to the international banking system , " he said to Todd . " But dammit , ours has to make more sense than carrying your money around on your tail ! " " I 'm beginning to wonder , " Todd muttered . " No , no , " he said to Azazel . " Not important . " It was now very apparent that the Humans were by no means  | the first new race the Angli had met . Fleeting images of many other aliens , worlds , cities , ships , crossed their perceptions from various Angli minds . These aliens seemed to have spent years jaunting about the Galaxy , meeting people and things . As to the Angli 's own home world  --  the notion that they were Martians was disposed of very early  --  they were shown an image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a GO-type sun . A view of the nearby constellations enabled the men to guess that it was near the nebula in Orion 's sword . A close-up view showed a lush , attractive landscape with a bubble-dome town . And the Angli were not alone ! Another intelligent race lived there  --  no , wait , had lived there once ? " many times ago . " The blurred image of a porpoise-like creature with legs seemed to have passed through many minds . " They go " ? but whether they had left or died off was never clear ; these Angli perhaps did n't know . The Angli were alone there now . One last fact that came out was sensational ; the " bubbles " the men were in was n't their only ship . They had maybe half a dozen ships and stuff parked on Luna , on the back side of our moon , where we could n't see them . One or more contained a lot more Angli , who wanted simply to sleep until a really promising planet was found . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Angli were also asleep there . Another one  --  or more ? contained members of another race , whose planet had been in trouble , so the Angli volunteered to find them a new one . ( In their experience , the Galaxy seemed to be full of all kinds of planets just waiting to be found . ) This particular race needed an aquatic environment , it seemed . Another ship seemed to contain assorted seeds and supplies ; despite their casual behavior , the Angli really had great practical sense about essentials . And at least two were empty  --  one had contained a race the Angli had successfully relocated . And a final one contained a spectacular cargo we on Earth were soon to get a view of . ( Of course , on learning that other ships existed , the general and others promptly began to suspect that the Angli also had  | battleships or other military capabilities parked up there , and many covert plans were laid to sneak around Luna and peek . But they all came to nothing , and nothing hostile ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the hours passed like minutes . Finally a growing emptiness in their middles forced the men to call a halt . " We eat now ? " The Angli too , it seemed , were tired and hungry , although so fascinated that they seemed ready to go on indefinitely . But at Jim 's question a cheer broke out among the young ones below . In no time they had produced great baskets of what looked like hardtack , and were carrying them around the auditorium , passing a container out to each row . Each Angli in turn helped him  --  or her  --  self to a piece , and tucked it neatly under a mantle-fold in their central bodies , where the men had surmised their mouths , or beaks , might be . " We 've got to get this gender business straightened out , " Todd said with his mouth full . " Oh , cripes . How do we do that , Tarzan ? " " Maybe we do n't , until we can produce a real Jane . " And so it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tries at describing Human sexes ? " Humans like Jim and me here " ? he indicated his genitalia ? " we call men . ' Other Humans have lumps here but not here  --  we call them women . ' And it takes both the two kinds together to make young ones , " Todd continued . " How do you make young ? " But here all impression of understanding faded , and an Angli question , " What you call Mathlon ? " stumped everybody . Mindvisions of an Angli picking things out of a puddle did n't help . ... Theodora Tanton here again , I just excerpted all that above from Jim 's long report , to give the atmosphere and show some of the problems ; I guess that some parts belong in the after-lunch session . And do n't shoot me , sisters , about the gender part and the " lumps , " that 's just what the man said . I put most dialogue as if it were ordinary speech instead of explaining 17  | whether it was telepathy or audible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of half-speech/half-thought lingo that worked well . The afternoon , or what was left of it , went as fast as the morning , and soon the sunlight that filtered through into the great central dome was visibly reddening into a typical Martian sunset . " We go back now , please , " the men said . " Our people have much fear . " " Ohh-Kayee ! " said Urizel , and they all laughed . One thing the men could n't get over was how human their laughter was  --  and they thought ours was incredibly Anglian . So they closed up the doors , the Humans suited up , the module lifted away silently from its slot , and the trip repeated itself in reverse . They tried again  --  it had come up all day  --  to understand the source of its power , but always the same answer baffled them . " We do with bodies . Like so " ? and the speaker would loft himself a few meters , apparently effortlessly , and descend again . " You no do , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find can do . " And a picture came in their minds of a large ray-like being , sailing and flapping above an alien landscape . The Angli tapped his head regretfully . " Fly pretty , but not have much brain . Come later , maybe . " Now on their return trip they could see their friends loading in , and it was obvious that they propelled their craft by simply pushing it up from inside , as a man under a table might lift it with his back  --  but with no need to press down on anything . Nor did it seem tiring . " Antigravity is the best guess we can make , " Jim told Earth later . One more item they were shown  --  in both the end compartments was a window in the floor , beside which was a bank of what turned out to be outside lights  --  including infra-red . They were powered by small batteries . " Use up fast , " Azazel said , frowning . And they did n't turn the lights on again until they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first construction of metal or wires the men had seen . It looked handmade . " We get from special people , " Azazel said , and transmitted a brief shot of some sort of aliens in an apparent workshop . " Not on our home . " " We make light too , " Urizel sent , and from under his ( or her ) mantle suddenly came a soft blue glow , which brightened to a point , then turned off . " Is work , " the big Angli said expressively . Light was evidently strictly for emergency use . They seemed to have fantastically good night vision ; the men suspected that their use of the floodlights as they neared the Lander was more for the Earthmen 's sake than their own . " You no see so good in dark . " " Maybe they were surprised when we did n't seem to see their approach last night , " Jim said . And then it was time to say goodbye and get back in their own little craft . And report to Mission Control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook for hours and hours and hours , " Todd said . And he was proved right . Kevin remembers vividly the shout that rang through Mission Control when the camera picked up their approaching lights . And then it took half the night to relay and record what I 've put down here , plus a lot of repeats and mix-ups I 've cut out . Oh  --  I 've forgotten one big thing . Just as they were leaving the dome a senior-looking Angli sent them a message through Azazel . " He say , why not we take you home to Earth ? Go quick , like maybe thirty-forty your days . We get Human now up in sky , leave your ships here , you come back and get some other time . And you help us say Hello and make friendship with Earth ? " What an offer ! " And with a soft landing at the end , " crooned Todd ecstatically . " Tell him yes , most happy , " replied Jim . " Say  --  is he your leader ? " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government . As far as we ever found out , they virtually had none . The older Angli formed a loose sort of council that anybody who wanted to could be in . Any question , like where to 19  | go next , or what to do about a specific problem , was apparently solved by informal mind-melding . People would put up ideas , and they 'd be mulled over until a consensus evolved . What happened in the event of a serious disagreement ? But there does n't seem to have been any . " Oh , we take turns , " said Azazel negligently . ... Anyway , thus it was that the great homecoming of our successful Mars mission was in an alien ship in no way under the control of NASA , although they politely accepted all our communications . And they seemed surprised at the close supervision expected from and by Mission Control . On their home world , apparently , people just wandered hither and yon , off to a moon , or whatever . One of the rites of growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were indeed gigantic dried seed-pods ) and fitting it out for long trips . With their long-range mind-speech capability there were no problems about getting lost , and their world seemed to have had few dangers . About the only mishap that seemed likely to occur to young ones jaunting about was when their presence or chatter annoyed some elder citizen who would complain to the council , and have them grounded for a week or two . Like youngsters everywhere , they prized mobility and were always putting in work improving their craft , which virtually served as alternate homes . The climate , one gathered , was very benign . It sounded idyllic ; I was n't the only one to start to wonder why , really , they had left ... . The day of their arrival on Earth has been so amply covered in schoolbooks that I have only small pieces to add , like about the riot . What went on at first was all standard  --  this great beige bubble-nest wafting down toward a cleared-off area in a sea of people , escorted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the air . It sat down resiliently and before it had finished heaving , Angli all over the top began opening doors and looking out . A group escorting the three astronauts got out  | together and flew them down to where a cordoned and carpeted way to the receiving stand was marked off . There was Urizel and Azazel , and a pair of aged senior councilors the men had persuaded to come along . Their progress was highly informal ; people could see that the men were trying to report back to their Commander-in-Chief in a stylish , military way , but the Angli were hard to keep in line . They began thought-broadcasting to the crowd in general , right over the heads of the officials . And then they hooked into the PA system with " Hello ! Peace ! Friends ! " And the press corps broke the lines by the ship and began infiltrating everywhere . Kevin was with the NASA press contingent , he passed me a few tidbits . And the aged councilors , to whom one Earthman was much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were standing , arms linked , with their backs to the ship , trying to contain the swaying crowd . And during the official party 's slow progress to the stand , Angli began coming out of the ship and making short flights over the heads of the crowd . The stage was set for trouble , and it happened  --  five or six dark-blue young Angli came out together with their arms full of something and flew over the crowd to the right , looking for a place to land and calling out " Friends ! " and laughing that Human laugh . What they had was blooms from the ship 's hydroponics , big fragrant stalks that unfortunately looked a bit like hand grenades . The crowd was too thick below them , so they began dropping the flowers onto people 's heads . At that , the Humans below started to mill , some people backing away in alarm while others pressed forward curiously . And the youngsters circled close overhead , laughing and pelting people with flowers . Suddenly someone took real fright , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing people running and feeling themselves pushed , began to run and push aimlessly too . Shouting broke out . The pushing intensified fast  --  and a woman screamed and went down . 21  | All this showed only as a confused place on the edge of the TV screens , while the astronauts and the Angli were still straggling up the cordoned pathway to the stand where the presidential party was waiting . As the sound of shouting rose from off-screen , the United States Marine Band broke into a louder march-piece , which amplified the confusion over an outbreak of real screaming and yells . Urizel , sensing what was happening , dropped Todd 's arm and flew over the tangle with the idea of shooing the youngsters back to the ship . But the arrival of this monster of much greater size frightened more people . The fallen woman was trampled and began to shriek . Urizel , spotting her , dived to the spot and sent his long tentacles down to extricate her , really scaring the people nearby . About then , police sirens started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began pressing into the scene . This excited more people outside the immediate nucleus . Some tried to gather their families and run , while others ran toward the uproar . The yelling developed a panicky , ominous beat . Meanwhile , those on the red carpet were still making their slow way to the President on the stand . Now , every telepathic race is well aware of the terrible danger of contagious panic , the threat of a mind-storm . Both inside the ship and out , the Angli became aware of what was going on , and about to get much worse . Their response was automatic . In perfect synchrony , they all stopped whatever they were doing , and sent out a united , top-power mental command : " Quiet ! Be calm ! Sleep ! . . . QUIET ! BE CALM ! SLEEP ! ! ! " It blasted the field . So powerful was this thought-command that by the first repetition the yells and shouts died in people 's throats . The uproar tapered down to a strange silence , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too were overwhelmed . Running people slowed to a walk , to a standstill ; their heads drooped , and they saw the ground looking invitingly  | comfortable , attracting them to relax down . And suddenly , all in the moments that the great command silently went out , what had been a wildly agitated mob became a field of peaceful sleepers . Some slept sitting with their heads on their knees , others sprawled full-length , their heads on any neighboring body . The police and Secret Service men were of course affected too , and after a moment 's heroic resistance , they went down in waves atop their sleeping charges . The band and the PA system were silent , and on the receiving stand the dignitaries retained presence of mind only to locate a convenient chair before collapsing into sleep . The President was already dozing ; he opened his mouth and emitted a few snorts indicative of deeper slumbers , while his lady slept decorously beside him . A stray seagull alighted on the Secretary of State , and went to sleep on one leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disturbance , floated Urizel , the woman he had rescued sleeping in his grasp . He spotted the stalled ambulance , which emanated images of physical aid . " Wake up , " he said to the crew . " Here is Human hurt . " They snapped back to consciousness rubbing their eyes , and jumped to man the stretcher . " Put her here . " A press photographer beside them also woke , reaching by reflex for his camera , and got the banner headline shots of his life  --  Urizel stooping low with the unconscious girl draped photogenically across his tentacles , his great eye luminous with compassion and concern . " ALIEN RESCUES WOMAN FROM CROWD ! ALIEN CARRYING GIRL HE SAVED TO AMBULANCE ! " ( I found out from Kevin , who had been there too and waked first , that the photographer had luckily missed an even more sensational shot . Urizel , noting that this Human he carried seemed to differ from the astronauts , had seized the opportunity to check out the locations and nature of those " lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process rearranging quite a lot of her clothes . ) The woman turned out to be a Mrs. C. P. Boynton . She was only slightly bruised , and her statements to the press were ecstatic . " I was so scared , I knew that hundreds of people would trample on me and I 'd be killed . I just prayed to God , Help me ! ' And suddenly there was this great blue being flying over me like an angel , and he just reached down and pulled me out from under all those terrible feet ! And oh , he smells so lovely ! " What I want to convey is that the Angli would be getting a very good press , right from Day One . Back at the stand , the official greetings to and by the President finally came off . Perry tactfully roused the great man by murmuring , " Sir , I believe you were about to say a few words , " and he automatically rose up into his speech  --  just in time to divert the aged councilors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , rather disjointedly  --  but it is n't true that they then or ever played " Nearer My God to Thee . " And the reception rolled off . When it came time for Todd , Jim and Perry to part company from their alien friends , with whom they 'd spent over a month of intimate travel , things got pretty emotional . During the voyage home , the Rev. Perry had been observed to attach himself to Azazel in particular . Now , up on the receiving stand , the great blue forms of the Angli were turning away , to go back to their ship and leave the Humans to their own . They were up on their back tentacles , their heads towering above everything as they bade polite farewells to the President , his lady , and the Secretary of State , now minus his seagull . Perry quietly moved closer . Suddenly he dropped to his knees and flung his long arms around the tentacles Azazel was standing on . ( Perry was a huge man . ) After a moment of confusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face laid against Azazel 's side , and weeping . He was also mumbling something that sounded so private that no one listened , except Kevin . And no  | one knew what thought-speech he was sending to his big alien friend , or receiving back from him . The strange tableau lasted only an instant . Then Perry got up with great dignity and stepped back into line with Todd and Jim . And the moment was swamped by the hand-tentacle shaking going on all round . Kevin , who had been just outside the stand , told me afterward that at the end , Perry had said clearly , " Non Angli sed angeli " ? and if you do n't place the quotation at first , listen on . Now to sum up the impression the aliens were making , I 'll give you a letter I received in response to my first appeal for eyewitnesses . It was written by one Cora-Lee Boomer , aged eighty-nine , like this : " Of course I only saw it on TV you know . Maybe I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sandy place , Dry Lake Something . And they had guards all over . But the people just filled it up . And about eleven A.M. , I remember because it was time to feed the baby , Donald , we saw it coming down in the sky . It was like a big bunch of grapes only no stems . " And it kept coming down , real slow , I guess not to hurt anything , and pretty soon a helicopter was going around it , taking pictures . It was kind of tan colored , with antennae sticking out . All these round things pressed together like something I used to see  --  honey-combs . When they sent pictures from close up you could see all these blue eyes inside looking out . So beautiful . Excuse me , I ca n't say it right . " Mostly I try not to think about it , even today I can just see it . But that man I had then , he thought he was so smart . And I was a young fool , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good . Stay away from Whitey shit , he said . Excuse me . I was so young . " But when they landed and got out with the three men and I saw their eyes close up , I had a feeling he was wrong . They looked so beautiful . Like caring and understanding . And smiling too . I should have believed my own eyes . " So I only saw things start . He came in and saw me looking  | at it and turned the set off  --  it was on all the channels , see  --  and said , Get my lunch . ' So I never saw much of them after that . And of course I never got to go . " I think now he was wrong , he was crazy . They were good , good . But I was so young and the baby kept me pretty busy , and with my job . Now I 'm old I know there 's more to life . I wonder what it be like . George , he 's long gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I cry a lot . " I hope this is what you said you wanted . Sincerely , Cora-Lee Boomer . " This is Theodora Tanton again , saying well , that was the way the Earth 's first meeting with the Angli went . I know the White Book does n't tell about the riot , and the little points Kevin saw . But they 're important , to show how people were starting to feel a certain way about the aliens , to explain part of what happened later . People could have been disappointed , see , or bored . The aliens brought no hardware . And all the films and fiction we used to see kind of assumed that our first contact with ALIENS was going to result in a lot of new fancy technology , or at least a cure for the common cold . Goodies . But as Urizel said , these people brought us only peace and friendship  --  at least on the surface people could see . Their own goodies , like antigravity and telepathy , were just in their bodies  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could hand over our sense of smell . And then more things happened to excite the press . To everyone 's surprise , the big ship simply broke up next day , with Angli flying pieces of it all over . Soon there was nothing left in NASA 's guard ring but some struts and potted plants . " ALIENS WANT TO SEE WORLD ! ALIENS TO VISIT CATHEDRALS ! ALIENS STUDY WORLD RELIGIONS ! CALL FOR LANGUAGESPEAKERS ! ALIENS DO NOT READ OR WRITE ! ALIENS WANT TO MEET EVERYBODY ON EARTH ! " ( That would be some of the youngsters chatting up the press . People had trouble sorting out the kids ' stuff , at first. )  | So Angli started turning up in little groups , or even alone , all over , at any time of day or night . Of course that gave the security forces of all the big nations total fits . It turned out they need n't have worried too much about the Angli 's safety . ( Their own security was another matter . ) But it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them long before the thinker could act . I do n't know if this is in the White Book or not , but just to show you : One afternoon some Angli were in Libya , chatting with people at a market by a highway where cars were whizzing by like mad amongst the livestock and all . Suddenly every Angli grabbed a nearby Human or two and shot straight up in the air , maybe twenty meters . At the same time , two more Angli grabbed a certain car , and flying with it , simply flipped it tail-over into the empty space they 'd made . Next second there was an explosion as a bomb went off inside the car , and a few people got cuts . The would-be bombers were dead . It all happened so fast people were totally bewildered , they had to piece together afterwards that some crazies had been going to blow the Angli up . And the Angli had taken defensive steps both for themselves and nearby people . That part of it was what stuck in people 's minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Then there was another big episode that may be in the White Book . It was when an Angli named Gavril was being taken on a scenic drive down the great road called the Corniche , in France . Gavril got tired of looking at the dirty Mediterranean  --  I guess he could hear the thoughts of dying fish and seabirds  --  and started casting about . Next thing , he had flashed up onto the air from the open convertible , paced the car briefly , and then come to rest on a railway overpass . A rail line ran below the road . By the time his hosts got back to him , he was standing with closed eye , so evidently deep in concentration that they just waited . Then train hootings began in the distance and Gavril opened his eye .  | " Is O-kayee now , " he said . " People see people . " And he lofted back into the car , offering no explanation . Of course his hosts began questioning , especially as there seemed to be some excitement starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it transpired , is that Gavril had picked up the thoughts of two trainloads of people approaching each other at terrific speed in the tunnels below . Happening to notice that the line was single-track , he became concerned and hopped off to check . Yes , he realized . They were heading for a frightful crash . Gavril shot strong mental blasts at the trains ' engineers  --  it was hard work aiming simultaneously at targets speeding opposite ways ? " Danger ! STOP ! " As I said , it was difficult . When he finally brought them to a stop , the headlight of each train was just visible to the other . Well , when his hosts realized what he 'd done , they called in the press , and hundreds of grateful passengers besieged the scene . A photo of Gavril hovering over a locomotive , captioned " ANGE DE MERCI , " appeared in all the big French papers that night . Apparently about six hundred people would have died without his intervention ; somebody , presumably terrorists , had buggered the automatic switch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the media after that , and scads of episodes , true and concocted , were headlined . There grew up a feeling that Angli were symbols of benevolence or good fortune and that it was lucky to be in the presence of one . People actually began plucking at them , hoping to tear off a little scrap of " armor " to carry with them like rabbit 's feet , I guess . But of course they were n't wearing armour , they were in their skins . The situation would have been dangerous and painful had it not been for their telepathic warnings . As it was , a couple of youngsters got scratched , and they all took to wearing flowing scarves they could cut up and pass out . " Is a little cra-zee , people your world , " Todd said Urizel told him . Of course profuse apologies were extended by all authorities , but there is no  | controlling mobs . And the Angli began drawing mobs , crowds of very emotionally wrought-up people , quite different from merely the curious or sensation-seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should know and tell you , because for sure they 're not in the White Book , but you know , I never completed my research  --  never began it really . To do so I 'd have had to go to what 's left of a dozen countries , and get into the USSR and even find certain hospitals . For the Angli were visiting places and talking to people they never saw fit to mention to NASA or anybody here , even to Todd , Jim and Perry who had become their more or less official escorts . Well , you may ask , what kind of inside story do I have , if I never did the research ? Oh , the research was just an ornament I envisioned , to the real tale that fell into my hands  --  wait ! And that aside about the hospitals is a guess , by the way . It could have been university labs , or even private industry facilities . The gist of it is that somehow some Angli found the means to do a spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an instinct for places where the press was strictly controlled , but that only came out later . What came out then were two things of overpowering interest . First was their plans to leave . To leave ? To leave ? ? To just go jaunting off somewhere out in the Galaxy  --  and maybe never come back ? This was a jolt . Maybe some higher-ups somewhere had done some serious thinking about how all this would end , but it had n't reached the public . In fiction and films there was always some sort of permanence after the great Earth/Alien meeting ; either the aliens were trying to take over , or Earthmen had beaten a path to their planetary doorstep , or something implied that there would be more contact , or at least some permanent effects . Not just this , " Hello , Nice-to-meet-you , Bye-bye " business the aliens seemed to have in mind . A visit . Was that all this was ? 29  | The answer seemed to be , Yes . Why ? Not that anyone had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why leave so soon ? Answer : They had things to attend to . There were all those beavers , or crocodiles , or whatever , sleeping up on the moon , waiting for the Angli to find them a water-world . And there were  --  God , there were all those other Angli up there , waiting to wake up when they found a real planet ! And of course Earth would n't do . Here the Angli tried to be tactful , but it soon came out  --  Earth was to them a sort of planetary slum , too dirty and polluted and used up and overcrowded to live in . " An interesting place to visit , but ? " Not , of course , that any government had actually extended them an offer of real estate . ( Some private citizens , especially those from Texas and Australia who seemed to own extraordinary amounts of the Earth 's surface , did make some offers to " interested Angli families . " ) What would be really nice , people thought , would be if the Angli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . What about Venus or Mars ? Could n't they remake one , with some magical planet-shaping devices ? And stay around ? Answer : Too bad , but we really have n't any magical planetshaping tools , and everything else in your particular solar system is quite , quite uninhabitable . Sorry again . As all this went on at an accelerating tempo , various people extended to the Angli some truly remarkable job offers , or suggested ways that they could make a living on Earth . Even the Mafia turned out to be very interested in their possibilities as security guards , with that telepathic alarm system . Strange Arabs called upon them at night . Several large churches even offered them substantial sums to stay and lead services . And a great many national intelligence or security agencies tendered proffers . All of these the Angli listened to with good-humored mystification . One evening when Earthly economics were being discussed , an Angli pulled out a coconut-sized pod filled with what appeared to be five- to ten-carat diamonds of exquisite  | color . " Like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over there " ? waving a tentacle in the general direction of Alpha Centauri . " Go get quick . " By the time the matter was explained the bottom had fallen out of the diamond market from Pretoria to Zurich . And it was intimated that they had resources of gold , or anything you cared to name , cached about . What they really liked , personally , was flowers . Particularly dandelions of large size . Private applications to the Angli took on a distinctly different tone after this . But it did not affect the public 's emotional view of them as simply benevolent miracle-workers , angels of mercy  --  or , now that we are getting nearer the point , simply angels . Clearly a great outcry of mourning , a great weeping lay ahead . The day they would leave would be so black . People could n't think about it . And then came the second event , or shock . The Angli seemed to be completing their study of our cultures and especially our religions  --  if " study " is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply to ask questions . They were very interested in anything we were doing , whether it was running a paint factory or conducting a service in Notre Dame . But they always asked people about their beliefs , or rather , about their god or gods . And one question which never failed to come up was , " Where is your god ? " After they had received an inventory or description of , say , the Hindu pantheon , they always wound things up by asking , " Where are they ? Where are they now ? " They got strange answers , of course . People pointed to the sky , or Westminster Abbey , or the Golden Pavilion ; one man took them to the Grand Canyon . But when it came to seeing a given god or gods  --  well , we had to struggle with terms like " immaterial " or " transcendent " or " immanent . " And they seemed , not exactly disappointed , but very serious . Finally one day Todd turned the tables on them . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes . Many . " 31  | " And where are your gods ? " They were talking on a balcony overlooking the moonlit Great Pagoda of Moulmein . Azazel waved a tentacle moonwards . " Up there . " " Your gods are up there with your ships ? In spirit , you mean ? " " No . Gods  --  there ! Many . Most medium , some very old , one new big one , the greatest now . In ship . " Well , everybody figured they were sculptures , or images , or sacred relics of some sort . But the Angli assured us they were alive , very much alive . Only sleeping , like the other Angli . Well , uh , er . . . could they be seen ? Could we go there and see some ? But they were asleep , Azazel repeated . Then he and Urizel conferred . " Maybe is good they wake up one time , " Urizel concluded . " Travel sleep long . You want we bring them here , show you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE REAL GODS . ASLEEP ON MOON . " " ANGLI GODS TO VISIT EARTH ! " And so an Angli delegation took off for Luna , to prepare their gods . And USA officialdom prepared to receive a supernatural visitation . Of course they did n't believe , then , that they 'd be getting anything supernatural ; their thinking ran to imagining Angli dressed up in costumes . But the Angli seemed to be taking this very seriously . They returned from all over Earth , and their original ship reconstituted itself . Seeing this , the Reception Committee decided they had best take it more seriously too , and a committee of Earth 's religious heads was convened to be in the reception stand . The Pope at that time was a great traveler , and very with-it ; he insisted on being present . Of course , this threw official ecclesiastical circles into turmoil , as sanctioning a pagan religion . But he said , " Nonsense . All of us better come , to see what they 've got . " And the Patriarch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Archbishops were naturally eager . And the Protestant denominations joined in . So , seeing this unprecedentedly ecumenical gathering of Christians , the heads of other faiths were stimulated to attend , and what started as a simple showing of alien idols , or something of the sort , grew into the full-scale world-wide summit meeting of every religious affiliation that we all saw on TV . It all required a special super-committee , and the protocol was a nightmare . What it was really like , by the end of a few days , was a sort of confrontation of all Earth 's religions with their alien counterparts . But it was a confrontation we 'd lost from the start : while we had Human officials in all kinds of fancy garb and ceremonial ways , they had  --  gods . As we soon saw , when , that night a week or so later  --  another great bubble-ship came drifting , moth-quiet into the searchlights ' glare , and settled into its cleared landing-spot . ( The officials had learned from the first fiasco ; there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the ship where informal Angli excursions might take place was cleared too . And the crowd was held well back , behind some temporary banks of seats to which admission was charged . Great video screens hung over the field , so all who came could see . ) And they came ! The stands were soon overfull , with people crammed in everywhere . As the ship settled , it could be seen that this was a larger craft , with bigger " bubbles , " and a huge central bubble or dome . All the Angli were now present , lined up in a cordon around the perimeter in an unusually orderly fashion . And with them was a troop of Earth children , their arms full of flowers to present to the visiting divinities . An outer door opened , and out shambled a huge , somewhat decrepit Angli figure , his great eye watering and blinking in the glare . He was festooned all over with what appeared to be animal remains , especially fish-heads and tails , and his head bore the gigantic mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totem of early days , " said the announcer 's 33  | voice . " Surprisingly long-lived . " Angli attendants handed the tribal godlet a dripping morsel to eat , and led it to a roped-off area of resting couches . It sprawled on tentacles rather than walking upright , being evidently from a time when the Angli were still semi-aquatic . Next to emerge was a swathed barrel-shape , obese and possibly somewhat senile . Its eye rolled in what appeared to be malevolent confusion , as it was led away waddling , leaving a wet slimy trail . " An early fertility-deity " the announcer  --  a hastilysummoned anthropologist  --  explained . " The next to appear will be avatars of this early form . You will note the increasing cultural complexity . " ( The more alert members of the press , seeing the trend of events , were sending out emergency calls for anthropologists , ethnologists , and anyone who might interpret matters . ) " This , " said one of these , as the file of ever-taller and more impressive Angli divinities made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Earthly level of Astarte or Ishtar . " The Angli goddess , a veiled form undulating past him , turned her huge eye and sent him a look that made him drop his note-pad . By this time it was evident , from the height and demeanor of the newcomers , that they were not ordinary Angli dressed in costumes , let alone statuary or mobile idols . No ; this was another order of beings , coming into view before them in the night , and the crowd grew strangely silent . Even today , we do n't know what they were . We only know we saw gods . The last in this first group struck even Earthly eyes as a radiant figure , and she alone appeared conscious of the dignitaries ' stand . The dazzling lights , her sparkling , shimmering form and veils , made her  --  for it was to all earthly eyes a " she " ? at one moment a bizarrely seductive alien , at the next a surpassing Earthly beauty . As she paced gracefully down the carpet , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark overhead a  | nighthawk dropped to it and perched there . From somewhere strange music played . With a slight air of disdain she let her attendants turn her into the roped-off waiting area , and as she turned , her painted eye shot straight at the Papal Eminence an unmistakable wink . Then she stooped to accept an armful of flowers from a bedazzled child , proceeded into the reserved area , and stretched out upon an oversized , scroll-ended divan . It needed no commentator to tell the viewers that great Aphrodite had passed by . Behind her came a vast grizzled figure who limped , as had the Earthly Vulcan . And after a little space , a towering , commanding figure who glittered with menace , as he strode contemptuously down the way , alien weapons held high . Yet his eye seemed clear and boyish , though all else spoke of war and wrath ; even so had Mars appeared to his mother . Then came troops and bevies of bewilderingly decked and jewelled figures , some carrying emblematic instruments  --  minor deities , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dryads of the Greek pantheon , or Peris and Algerits and Indus of others . These danced along under rainbows , piping or singing , to herald the advent of a grand , hoary elder figure , the inevitable old male of unlimited power and authority , whether Zeus , Jove , Wotan or Jehovah . Although the night was perfectly clear , the rumble of far-off thunder accompanied them . Singing had broken out among the Angli as they all passed by ; it was the first time Humans had heard the Angli sing , and they found the chants both strange and pleasing . And on and on they came , deities resembling nothing familiar to Western eyes but more familiar to Persian , Indian or Chinese ; some in weird built-out costumes and serpentine decorations , great curled and feathered headpieces representing frowning grins , or elongations of the eye to dreamlike proportions . In hieratic poses , they made their ways to the appointed spot , and attendant heraldic animals came with them . Also in the air were random sparks , or flames , that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but seemed to have a life of their own as they danced and clustered here and there . Finally , in the midst of what appeared to be a throng of patriarchal tribal or national divinities , there stood out one of seemingly great power , draped in long white robes . He was oddly attended by what looked at first like small mechanical toys in the shapes of alien children , with sweet luminous eyes . But they were alive . " A culminant patristic deity , " the announcer explained . " He repeatedly reincarnated himself in his own son . Evidently he still has a few believers left . And now ? " He went into a huddle with his Angli consultants . In the pause that followed , all could see that one of the small son-figures had slowed to a stop , and seemed disoriented or ill . But a nearby Angli stooped and patted it solicitously , and it soon revived and ran on . The somewhat shaken commentator was asking the Angli , " Why do you carry with you these  --  uh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that your one real god or gods would be enough ? " " Ah , " said the Angli ( some of whom could now speak several Earth languages quite well ) , " but you see , the minds and spirits of those who worshipped those gods are still in us , under the surface of civilization . And civilization can fail . When we notice that one of those old divinities is growing in vigor , in vitality , yes ? it gives us warning . Too many among us are unknowingly worshipping those qualities again . So " ? he made stamping motions ? " like small fires , we put out quick . You see ? But now The singing had fallen silent , and for a few breaths no one moved ; there was a feeling of Something impending . Into the silence there stepped , or materialized , a tall , robed and veiled figure twice the height of any that had gone before . It was definably female . As she came down the way , her face turned toward the dignitaries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | was a concerted indrawing of breaths , almost a gasp . Across her single eye was a domino mask ; in the depths of its opening could be seen a deep spark of smoldering red-gold . But where the rest of her face and head should be was only black emptiness under the hood . Her garments moved as though covering a gaunt figure , but no feet or hands revealed themselves . Where she passed , children hid their faces in their flowers . And the line of Angli bowed like willows in a silent wind . Beside her paced an alien animal that she seemed to be restraining on a choke-chain ; one of her long sleeves descended to its head , but no hand could be seen . Below the creature 's eye was a tangle of tusks and cruel fangs ; its limbs were coarsely padded and savagely spurred , and its expression was a blend of coldness and hate . Once , as she moved , her beast lifted its head and gave out a long-drawn baying sound , and the distant thunder growled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a great single regal seat was placed for her apart from the others . In this she seated herself impassively . The surrounding Angli had dropped to what would have been a kneeling position in Humans , and the nearby Humans involuntarily turned their eyes away , and dropped their heads low . " This is she whom we now worship , " the Angli by the announcer said . " She has many names but only one essence . Here you might call her The Law of Cause and Effect . " " What is the . . . the animal ? " " That is her instrument of vengeance of all who violate her commandments . Either knowing or unknowingly . Listen ! " From all around the horizon came the echo of a baying sound . " Alas , my poor friends on your Earth  --  you do not worship her , but I fear your race has done violence to her Law . It may be that some terrible punishment is readying itself for you innocent ones . Bravely , the Human commentator asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37  | " No . That is just what I do not mean . That might have fretted only one of our tribal gods . The Law of Cause and Effect has no objection to inquiry , and she will always answer . Her vengeance is reserved for those who activate a Cause without desiring its Effect . Like the failure to anticipate the result of accelerated multiplication upon a finite surface . " " But ? " " Hush . " To the crowds , who had heard little of this complex interchange and were becoming restless , he spoke out : " Please do not rise now . There is one more to pass . " But nothing seemed to come from the great ship . Only those nearest to it suddenly shivered , as though a cold wind had passed , though nothing stirred . It reached the stairs to the reception stand , and apparently flowed upwards ; several dignitaries were seen to hug their elbows to their sides and shudder . Far away , lightning flashed , once . Then all was over . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcer said clearly . " Though what it will be we know no more than you ... Did you see the Pope cross himself ? Well , the rest you all must have seen ; they took the ropes down and invited everyone who wanted to to mingle with the gods . ( Luckily the security forces had been prepared for some such Angli-type informality , and got things organized in time . ) " In their present incarnate form , our gods are quite harmless , " the announcer said . " But they do have a habit , when bored or restless , of dematerializing into pure energy  --  if I grasp your language correctly  --  and in that form they can be very dangerous indeed . " Even as he spoke , there came a high tinkling crash like expensive crystal breaking , from the direction of Aphrodite 's couch , and it was seen that the Goddess had vanished , leaving only a cloud of white particles like doves or long-finned white fishes , who danced in Brownian motion before dispersing . A moment later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , with a minor boom , and the dancing of a few unidentifiable particles in the air where he had been . But all this you have seen , and seen also the preparation of the Angli for immediate departure , after they took their refreshed gods back to Luna in the morning . Their preparations also were highly informal , consisting merely of getting into their bubbles and reconstituting their ship with what souvenirs they had picked up . ( They were partial to postcards of cathedrals and bathing-beaches , and dried flowers . ) Aghast at the suddenness of all this , the Earth prepared to mourn the departure of these wonderful visitors . And then the great announcement came . That you must remember . A senior Angli simply asked , " Anybody want come with us ? We find good place . " Yes , they meant it . Would Humans care to come a-roving with them ? Not to be parted , but instead to find , with their dear new friends , a pristine Earth of clear sky and blue waters ? A whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WOULD THEY ? They would ! ! ! ? In such numbers that the Angli had to announce a limit of a million , to be accommodated asleep in their empty bubble-ships . There would be , by the way , no aging or death while in cold-sleep . Their selection process , like everything else , was simple and informal . In the US , Angli simply asked for room in parking lots ( every shopping mall owner in the land offered one ) and stationed themselves in any convenient place , holding a footballsize pod that had an open end . Applicants were invited to hold one hand in the pod for a minute or two , while the Angli stared at it . The pod felt empty inside . Applicants could wiggle their fingers , hold still , or feel the sides ; it seemed to make no difference , and the pod did not appear to change . After an instant or so the Angli simply said Yes or No , and that was that . Those accepted were told to go out to the ship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suggested wear 39  | ? this got printed on a slip  --  was one comfortable exercise suit , work gloves , sun visor , and sneakers . What basis were they chosen on , for this momentous voyage ? " They take the ones they like , " Waefyel told me . " But what does the pod do ? " " That way no arguments . " I remembered these people were telepaths . An Angli could investigate a mind in depth while its owner was holding his hand in a pod . But who is Waefyel ? Well , I forgot to tell you about meeting my own special Angli friend . Most of the rest of this comes from him . I met him , like so much else , through Kevin . Waefyel was acting as gofer for one of the aged councilors , who turned out to enjoy meeting Humans at those big receptions . The aged councilor would run out of water , or that hardtack stuff , which was all they ate , and Waefyel would get it for him . He met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waefyel was a young adult , male  --  question mark  --  we NEVER got that straightened out  --  and as nice as an Angli could be , which was very sweet indeed . But nice as he was , he could n't get me accepted to go after I flunked the pod test . I tried again  --  they had no objection  --  and again and again , but it was always No  --  and then they were over their million . " What 's the matter with me , Waefyel ? " He shrugged , an impressive gesture in an octopus . " Maybe know too much . " " Me ? But do n't you people like one to be smart ? " " No , we like . Only some kinds smart get killed by other Humans . " " Oh . " . . . But I knew what he meant . However , the Anglis did n't take a million boneheads , or a million anything . The group , what I saw of it , when I went out to the ship , was as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One selector had a weakness for redheads . ) However , they did appear to eliminate obvious no-goods , junkies , the badly  | crippled  --  I tell you , everybody tried , before it was over ! ? and a lot of people I personally did n't like the looks of either . The ones who got to go had a stamper pressed to their foreheads . It did n't leave any detectable mark , and they were told they could wash the place , or whatever . ( That had to be printed too , the Angli got tired of answering . ) At the ship , an Angli just glanced at the spot . I asked Waefyel if it was a thought-imprint , and he laughed . " No need . " I kicked myself mentally  --  of course , if a telepath looked there , the person 's thoughts would automatically tell whether he 'd been stamped or not . Oh  --  one more thing about the selectees : at the ship , the men got misted with an aerosol and were given an injection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For fertility . You make too many young ones , no can educate . " " You mean they 'll all be infertile ? Wo n't they die out ? " " For twenty of your years only . Then another twenty . Then another . " The concept in his mind was cycle . " Yes , ? that way no spoil everything , until learn better . " " How do they do it ? " And here 's where I learned about the sophisticated research . Apparently some Angli who like fussing with bio-science had found an opportunity to gene-splice a bacterium that would cause a Human male 's immune system to destroy , or rather inactivate , his own sperm . The antibodies , or whatever , wore out after about twenty years , thus allowing the man a couple of fertile ejaculations ; but the system was self-renewing , and it kicked back in and the infertility closed down for another two decades . And so on . It was also dominant-inheritable . Neat , no ? It seems there was an argument about the twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were persuaded that they were overreacting from revulsion at the state of our affairs .  | And of course you know all about the rest . I remarked to Waefyel , a pity they could n't do it to all Earth . But the men 's objections would be violent . He giggled again . " You no see sunsets ? Pretty green lights , no ? " " Well , yes , but they 've been explaining that ? " " We do it already , " he said . " Coming down in air now . Trouble , whew ! To make so much . Good your bacteria breed fast too . " What ? ? ? " Well , as I say , you know all about that . I was just the first to happen to know . Lord , I remember all the to-do , the fertility clinics besieged  --  of course it was blamed on women first . But finally it became too clear to ignore , especially as it affected a few related primates in a partial way . And the men had symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of active sperm were getting killed . But you know all that ; how we have an oldest generation of mixed ages , like me and older , and after that one generation all aged about forty , and then another about twenty . And then nobody , but some women are just getting pregnant now . ( " MOTHERHOOD AGAIN ! " " HUMAN BIRTHS RESUME ! " " WILL IT LAST THIS TIME ? " . . . It wo n't , I promise you . ) This was their going-away present to us , see . " We do good thing you , " as Waefyel put it . " Now maybe bad trouble coming not so bad . " And it has n't , has it ? We did just tiptoe by the worst of the war scares , but everyone worldwide was so preoccupied with trying to make babies that things quieted down fast . Of course it was hell on economies that were based on the asinine idea of endless growth , but that 's a lot better than being exterminated . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty billion people standing on top of each other were disappointed . But all the ecological stuff , the poisoning and wastage and sewage and erosion , all became soluble , once the steady thunder of newborn Humans cascading from ever-fertile bellies eased to a sprinkle every twenty years .  | People would have had to face the idea of a static economy sooner or later ; it was the Angli 's gift to let us do it while there were still living oceans left . But that 's all beside the point . When I got over the trauma of not being selected to go  --  no , I only sound like I 'm crying  --  I was still worrying that little old question : Why , really , did the Angli leave that paradise planet they came from ? Why ? " We want go see new places , " Waefyel said . " We bored . " But he did n't say it right . Maybe telepaths transmit whether they want to or not . " Waefyel  --  what really happened to those other people who were living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , or they die . I think they die . " That sounded sincere . " Your people did n't kill them off , by any chance ? " " Oh , no ! NO ! ! " You ca n't fake shock like that  --  I think . " So you just left , bringing your gods with you . . . What about the Angli that are still there , what 'll they do with no gods ? " " No Angli stay , is all here . Up on moon . " " H'mm . Small race , are n't you ? " " Three , four million . Is enough . " " And your gods . Hey , those gods were really alive , were n't they ? " We were lying on a little beach on one of the Virgin Islands , where Waefyel had flown us . ( If I could only live on hardtack , what journeys we could have made ! I did try the stuff , but it tasted like dried galoshes . ) " Of course they live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All gods do . " " Ours do n't , " I said lazily . " Hey , do other peoples have live gods ? " " Yes . " His big eye looked sad . " Except you . You first we find . No live gods here . " " Hey , you mean it . . . I thought gods were just an idea . " 43  | " Oh no , is real . Look out , you getting too hot . " " Yeah , thanks . . . Why did your gods want to leave that lovely planet ? " " Go with us . " " You mean a god has to go where its people go ? ... Hey , what happened to the other people 's gods , the ones that died off ? What happens to gods when their people die ? " " Usually  --  new word , see ? Usually , gods go too . Lost in air , finish . Sometimes . . . not . " His big eye was looking somber again . Not sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . " " Dead peoples ' gods just evaporate . How sad . H'mm . But sometimes not , eh ? What happens to a bunch of gods who live on with no people ? " " I do n't know . " He sat up . " Look , is too hot for you here . I listen your skin burning . " " Sorry . I did n't mean to fry audibly . " But I picked it up . What ? Just something . Time to change the subject , for Waefyel . Well , maybe it bored him . But I did n't think it was that . In my bones , I felt I was poking into something hidden . Something the Angli wanted hidden . " I hope your gods will like the new planet you find . You 'll be there , with the Humans , wo n't you ? " " Oh yes ! " He smiled . " We find nice big one , lots of room . Lots of flowers . " He touched a neck-chain of dandelion flowers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dandelions and crabgrass even on the Virgin Islands . ) " I bet our people will go back to the Stone Age , " I said idly . ( I did n't care if they went back to the Paleocene , if only I could have gone with them . ) " Hey , maybe they 'll start worshipping that old totem-animal of yours . " " Maybe . " As though involuntarily , his eye took on a dreamy smile . " And then when they get more advanced , they can worship that old fertility symbol . I guess they 'll be in the mood . And work up to the lovelies . You know , that 's neat ! Here we do n't have any gods of our own , and you provide us with a complete set , 44  | ready-to-go , carry-out gods ! Why do you suppose we do n't have gods of our own , Waefyel ? Is something wrong with us ? People make their gods , really , do n't they ? " " I think so . Yes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you have poison , maybe you kill gods ! " He laughed and fussed at my hair  --  I had pretty hair then  --  with his tentacle tip . " But I do n't think so . . . Some of the wise ones think you made a bad pattern of gods , some kind missing , see , so they could n't go on and make more . A defective series , ' that 's right ? " " That 's wrong , apparently . . . I wonder what we left out . Do you know ? " " No . . . but I think you got too many war gods . Not enough ones who take care . " " That sounds right . " I was about falling asleep , there in the beauty with the lapping little waves on the pink sand , and this lovely friend beside me .. . " I think we go inside now . Look Tee-Vee . I carry you . " " Oh , Waefyel . " ( Do n't expect me to tell you about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially then . It 's not what you 'd guess , either . ) Now there was a man staying at the hotel there . A serious older man , a sort of student . That evening we all got chatting , out on the terrace looking at the sunset . It did show the most lovely , weird green light . Beautiful infertility , drifting down . The uproar about that had n't started yet . Anyway , this older man started talking about angels . Rather pointedly , too . Funny topic , I thought . " Did you know that angels were the lowest order of divine beings ? " he asked me . " If there was something to be done , a flaming sword to be brandished , somebody to be admonished , or a message delivered  --  particularly a message  --  they called in an angel . They were the workhorses and message-bearers . " " Yes , " said Waefyel , unguardedly . I wonder what interest ancient myths about angels could possibly have for him . Probably he just enjoyed practicing his English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " The gofers of the gods . " 45  | So of course I had to explain gofers . ( He was an older man . ) Waefyel was delighted too . His first English pun , if that 's what it is . " How did angels get born ? " I asked . " What about those little ones , cherubs , cherubim ? Were they little angels ? " " No , " said the man . " The connection of cherubs with infants is a late degradation . As to how angels got born , I wonder . I 've never heard of an angel 's mother or father . " " From the energy in the air , " said Waefyel unexpectedly . " Elementals . " " Is there energy in the air ? " I asked . " You saw it . When gods dematerialize , a lot of it is around . Elementals , " he repeated . And then suddenly frowned as if he were mad at himself , and shut up . Next day we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day after was the twenty-fourth . And even you must know what happened then : They left . Do n't expect me to tell you a word about that , either . Me just standing there , looking up at a vanishing point that reflected sunlight for one last instant . . . Me and a couple of million , no , more than that  --  just standing there with eyes streaming our hearts out , looking up at a sky that would be empty forever .. . But at least I know , for all the good it does me , what had held me in its arms . Waefyel let out just enough so it had to be true . You get the picture , do n't you ? Or do I have to explain it ? I put it to Waefyel once , at the end . " You 're not an animal , like me , are you ? You 're something created out of energy , out of the minds of that race that died . You Angli are just pretending to be people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , Waefyel ! " " No . Symbiotes  --  I know word . You good for us , we good for you .  | " But you 've trapped a million Humans to go with you and keep you alive ! " " They need us . They happy . " Surely you see . There they were , when that other race who had made them died off  --  a whole complete pantheon-ofpantheons , all those gods from earliest to last , from highest to the lowest " workhorses . " As good as dead , doomed to live forever on an empty planet with no living energy to need them or support them . So what did they do ? I mean , what did the higher-ups , the l really big gods , do ? This whole evolution of orphaned , unemployed gods , doomed with no people ? Why , they ordered their faithful workhorses , their lowest order of functionaries , their angeli ? ( the sound of that name was just one of those cosmic coincidences , by the way ; it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angeli to build ships and take them somewhere . To find a race that needed gods and take them there ! And eventually they got here and found a people with no gods ... ? And now some of our people will have gods again . And the gods will have people . Let them ; I 'm not jealous . All I want is one of the gofers back . My gofer of the gods . 47  | When God died , the Devil survived him awhile . The obsequies were impressive , and not unduly long . Out of respect for his old Adversary , Satan ordered that the more flamboyant fires of Hell be banked , and the noisiest sinners muffled ; he also decreed a half-holiday for senior staff  --  a purely arbitrary usage of antiquity , since Hell has neither night nor day . As the last elegiac choirs of cherubim faded through the empyrean , so clear as to be heard even in Hell , Lucifer felt an odd disquiet in his brazen heart . It was almost as though some unaccountable new responsibility had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange new epoch . Might it not be fitting , now that it was presumably possible , for him to pay his last respects in person ? But the flight upward would be a long one . He had come down express , but even so , morn had changed to noon , and noon to dewy eve , en route . He shuddered , causing a small thunderclap , as he recalled how his once-snowy pinions had changed to ebon bat-wings , his feet to taloned hooves , and his  | bright angelic features to the grim ( but , he always considered , distinguished ) features he now bore , as he fell . A long way .. . and he was older now . Surely it would be only sensible to have a medical check-up first ? He whistled up a posse of work-goblins to scour the pits for viable physicians , and leant upon a forward battlement of his dread castle to wait . High above the Purgatorial Plain , the view always soothed him . Here and there through the middle distance sparkled the flares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molten metal ran hissing to the Sea of Torment . Charred barracks and camps for the lower orders of fiends marked the ashy plain , while behind all towered the black abutments of the Mountains of Hell , each with its special horror . And looming above the center of the range he had had the fancy to install a great snow-clad peak , where he could arrange suitable punishments for those exceptional sinners who could endure heat . Its topmost spires were lost in the low-hanging gray clouds that scudded perpetually , mockingly , above the parching Plain . In the foreground of this spectacular view yawned the Pit of Hell proper , whose seven levels had been besung by poets . From sentiment , Satan had n't changed things there much of recent centuries . Down below the seventh level lay the fearful Gulf of Silence . Not even he knew what was in its deeps . Every now and then he would cause some especially vociferous evildoer to be flung down there , and listen attentively to the long-dwindling ululations . But none ever returned to tell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated devising some chain of bodies by which the gulf might be plumbed , but he had as usual been kept too busy with the interminable adjudications and squabblings of the hierarchy of Hell . Once , one of the modern breed of scientists , condemned to a short stay for excessive media exposure , had said that it might be a black hole in the making , since energy and matter here  | conformed to other laws ; but he overestimated the Satanic attention-span , and was himself pitched in before he 'd worked out half his theory . Remembering this , Lucifer leaned far out , to send his dark gaze into the darker depths . Might this be a gateway through which some new phenomena appropriate to this new age would come ? But darkness met only darkness , with no change so far as he could tell . . . . Or , were there the faintest strange phosphorescent gleamings , as of something in slow stir , deep down there ? He stared his hardest , still unable to be sure . And the doctors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricked pomposities and singed Feelgoods , all yapped and nipped on by the younger trolls . Lucifer turned and raked them with his terrible orbs , opening for the occasion his third one , which sees only fact . He thus detected one doctor whose qualifications were genuine  --  a sorry wight who had come under ecclesiastical displeasure for some forgotten crime , such as administering anaesthetic to women in childbirth . When Satan explained what was wanted , this man left off his groaning and agreed that a check-up was a sound idea . But he held up the stumps which were all that the Holy Office had left of his erring hands . " You shall have them back  --  when I return safely , " Satan told him ; the flare of desperate hope in the man 's eyes made the goblins snicker . " The heart would be your problem , " the doctor said . " But , er , Your Majesty  --  do you have one ? " " I do , " snapped Satan . " Examine it instanter ! " So instruments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the doctor went to work . Although he had a little difficulty in persuading the Lord of Hell to submit to a stress-test  --  several bystanding demons were inadvertently incinerated  --  everything proved out satisfactorily , and soon his mighty patient was pronounced fit for an extended upward flight . " Your respiratory-vascular systems are as sound as a young tiger 's , " the doctor told Satan . " But even so , I can not guarantee 50  | against the effects of , er , psychic trauma . Stresses of , ah , supernatural origin , such ? " " You take care of the flapping , and I 'll take care of the flaps , " Satan replied , and waved them all back to their respective torments . Noting that some of his higher-ranking subordinates seemed to be evincing an undue cheer , he gave them all a short but pungent lecture on the folly of ambition in Hell . Then he strode to his tower for takeoff , the imps he had delegated to put up refreshments scampering in his wake with the pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his great black wings , and was soon riding the massive thermals of Hell , circling ever higher above his domains . Only he knew which of the tiny flecks of lesser darkness contained the promise of true light above . As the smog thickened below him , and the faint glow of the sky slowly brightened around , he found himself in a sphere where there seemed neither up nor down , nor anything to mark his way . The thermals faded out . Disorienting ; but his instincts guided him true and he knew that he would soon emerge . But as his powerful wingbeats carried him higher , he could not help but wonder uneasily what his reception would be , and whether all that he assumed were so . That God was dead or at least seriously disabled , he knew ; if only because he had been able to lay hands , or claws , upon the distraught messenger . The poor celestial was so overcome that he could only squeal helplessly as he was taken , and the Devil himself had been so surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wring the truth from him , he had contented himself with jerking out a fistful of wing-feathers before he let him go , still shrieking futilely for Divine Help . By this Satan was quite sure of the truth of his message , for had his Opponent yet lived , even a failed attempt on His minion would have brought pyrotechnic displays of His displeasure . But what else went on up there ? Odd things had happened before . Take the whole business of 51  | the Son and his fate . Flapping steadily , Satan shook his head ; the metaphysics of all that had been too much for his pragmatic mind . The Father of a virgin 's son ? The crucifixion as a triumph ? And the whole Resurrection hoopla  --  Noli me tangere , **28;755;TOOLONG  --  either you 're resurrected , or you 're not , was Satan 's opinion . He respected the man Jesus as a sincere fanatic  --  he himself had made a tiring , good-faith effort at the Temptation ; but the rest was all too much . To Satan , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotence . Was something more in this line going on up there ? Would he arrive to find some cockamamie Reincarnation , perhaps , in league with a borrowed deity ? That Vishnu chap , for instance , had some vitality left . Omniscience can change to nulliscience , or omnisenility ; he hoped he was n't spending all this effort to meet with some metaphysical rodomontade . Almost , he turned back . But then the sky cleared abruptly , and his misgivings vanished as he saw a familiar marker . He was passing it from below this time , but he knew what it read : ALL HOPE ABANDON YE WHO ENTER HERE . It was about when he fell past this that the last of his halo had gone skittering away lightless in a scorching blast from Hell . Death , what a day that had been ! Now he took a quick scan about , just to make sure that all was in order , and no guardians who had n't got the Word were there to contend his way . All clear . He continued mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bluest of blue skies , set with tiny pearled clouds . Far below , a faint smudge concealed his own immense dominions , but no sulfuric scent of them reached here to comfort his nose . How quickly he had come ! Was he much stronger than he 'd believed , or had Space itself shrunk ? Who could say ? And yes , high under the celestial vault he could now make out a shining , a thickening island of something more than cloud . Why , Heaven itself was in view  --  he had already come halfway ! It was definitely time for a snack . 52  | A little cloudlet was passing him . " Like to like in the empty air , " he told it , " The Lord of Matter desires a chair . " A gesture , and the thing condensed gratifyingly into a sumptuous airborne couch . Things had changed , all right , he told himself . No simple black spell would function here if his Enemy still lived . He found that the imps had packed a proper lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tongues ( in which one of the smallest imps seemed to have become entrapped , so that he had to pluck it out and fling it away screeching . Little cannibals ! ) And a flask of raped virgins ' tears , yes  --  and some pickled bikers ' parts , a nice contemporary touch . He must remember to commend them on his return , he thought , munching pleasurably . Perhaps they 'd like a plump politician all to themselves to torment ? Gratitude was of course unheard-of in Hell ; but a good administrator knows how to keep the help functioning . Lifting the flask of tears , he reflected that he had indeed passed his point of no return : it was the sight of the Heavenly City that marked the limits of his banishment . Well , he would see it again now , the place he had so nearly come to rule , and where he had refused to serve . Not for an instant had he regretted his choice ; but now an odd melancholy , almost a nostalgia , stole into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilled , he 'd forgotten how blessed cold it was up here . " Fire ! Your Prince commands you , glow ! My resting-place alluming . Come warm me for an hour or so  --  but burn without consuming . " And at his cabalistic sign , a border of flame like Elmo 's fire sprang out around the couch and himself , creating a cozy little inferno . He finished his repast in a cheerier mood , then rose and grandly stretched his fiery form . As he turned he noticed that he 'd left quite a mess ; a wave of the hand abolished it . No need to act like an orc ! And with a mighty wing-buffet to the air , he was on his way upward again , his eyes on the growing splendor above . In what seemed a very short time , the flame-edged shadow of his dark wings fell upon the drawbridge leading to the Gates of 53  | the City . The bridge was down , the great gates stood ajar . No one was in sight . As he hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter rose sleepily from the flowery greensward beside the gates . " Avast ! " cried Peter , rubbing his eyes . " Away with ye , black scum ! What do ye here ? ? Oh , sorry , " Peter interrupted himself . " For a moment I f-forgot . " And the poor saint looked so woebegone that Satan checked his retort . " Well , so you 've come too  --  you might as well come in . " But when Peter went to push the Gates wider , the task seemed so far beyond his strength that Lucifer gave him a hand , being careful not to scorch the beautiful pearl-work . " Did you not receive my condolences ? " he asked . " Oh , yes  --  I meant to tell you , we did appreciate your note . And the lovely wrought flowers . Of course the wreath was a little warm " ? here Peter glanced at a burn-mark on his palm ? " we had to quench it a little first . But it 's nice to know folks stick together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his throat . " just thought I 'd come up and see how you all were fixed . " Then , as the full view of the Heavenly City opened to him , he halted . " My word ! It  --  it certainly has held up well ! You 've done a splendid job of maintenance , ca n't have been easy . . . It 's been so long , but do n't I see a few new features ? Additions and enhancements ? " " Oh yes . " Peter revived a bit . " One must keep up with the centuries , you know . And we get so many fine artists up here . Although , I must confess , some of the very recent stuff  --  ah well , I 'm no art critic . " " I thought I recognized that Calder . " Satan pointed to a vast luminous mobile . " But that one , frankly ? " he indicated a giant cow 's skull against a blue sky . " An original O'Keeffe , " Peter said , a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Would  --  would you care to have me show you about ? " " I would indeed , " Satan replied . " But where are all your 54  | people ? I should have thought you 'd be quite crowded with the Blessed by now . " " Oh , everyone 's gone for the day . Uriel  --  he 's so practical ? he decided they had to do something to lift the atmosphere . So he and Rafe and the rest organized a picnic excursion to the Elysian Fields . Some of the old shades can still talk a bit , you know . It 's very interesting . So they 've all gone  --  that is , the ones who still have enough individuality left . " " Individuality ? How do you mean ? " " Do n't you find that ? Oh well , it 's that so many of ours seem to just melt away into grand abstraction , after a time . I expect it 's the pure air , or something . And with all that singing , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , as it were ? " " No , I ca n't say they do . Mine stay all too identifiable . Although now you mention it I do seem to have noticed a rather shapeless vortex developing around one or two of my chaps . Fellow named Hinckel , or Hittle . Or was it Nickerson ? Or Failwell ? " Peter nodded . " That 's how it starts . And then more and more get sucked in till you get a kind of critical mass , and Blooie ! ? There 's nothing left but a radiance . " " In this case it 'd be more like a bad smell , I imagine , " Lucifer commented . " But seriously , perhaps we have less merging because there 's so many different ways to sin , but only one way to , ah , enter here ? " " That could be it ! " exclaimed Peter ; he seemed quite happy now . Peter loved a good theological argument , Satan remembered . " Although it has been said that evil is monotone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-et-lumiere . I never can pronounce that right . It 's all computerized , " he added with shy pride . " And that 's our sports palace . " They were strolling by an impressive amphitheatre . Satan could see the scoreboard rising above the stands , but the format puzzled him  --  it seemed to show nothing but winners . " Oh , it would n't do to have people lose , " Peter told him . " The aim is to achieve a perfect draw at the highest possible 55  | score . You 'd be surprised what thrilling games we have , when each team has to help the other avoid a win . " " I would indeed , " Lucifer agreed politely . And then they fell silent , for they were entering the Avenue of the Blessed , the grand colonnade from which the risen spirits had their first view of the Divine Radiance . It was still radiant , and as they proceeded along , Lucifer was quite touched to see that the old barbaric Throne was still quite visible under the Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolt when he raised his gaze and perceived that Throne and dais were completely empty . " Watch . " Peter whistled , and a passing dove alighted on his hand . The saint pressed what seemed to be a small set of buttons on the dove 's breast . At once the radiance increased tenfold , in a great upspringing fan-work of colored lights , which seemed to elevate dais and all into a sunrise of coruscating brilliance , wheeling and changing as they watched , until the mind was quite bewildered . At the same time , music played , now sinking to a murmur , now rising in crescendo  --  a totally stunning effect . " Marvellous ! " the Devil murmured . " Bravo ! " " If only you could have seen it when  --  when ? " But the poor saint broke down in weeping and could not continue . Satan turned away considerately , and found his own throat constricted . The nostalgia which had touched him earlier was back again , stronger than before . It all seemed such a shame . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Instead of asking the questions he had intended , having to do with the details of the Lord 's demise and the complications of the Trinity , he found himself saying consolingly , " There , there , old friend . Always remember what a splendid career was his , starting from a simple nomadic desert deity . " " Y-yes , that 's t-true , " sobbed Peter . " You must forgive me . It 's just that  --  ohhhh . " And he wept again briefly . " No need , " said the Devil gruffly . " I assure you , I sympathize . " Then seeing that the old saint seemed quite disori-56  | ented , he asked in gentle tones , " But tell me , what are you going to do with all of this ? " Peter gulped and blew his nose . " Well , at first we were just intending to maintain it as it is . After all , there is always the p-possibility that  --  the p-p-possibility  --  forgive me . Yes , main- tain it as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-ups have had word that the space is going to be needed . We do n't know what for . But after all , we have had the lion 's share , so to speak , so perhaps it 's fair . So we 're having a kind of , of greensward sale , you might say . " The Allah people have a bid in for the sound system  --  they do a lot of praying , and it seems they 're having quite a revival . " He nodded . " Yes , and they want some of the plantings , too . They are quite fond of flowers , I believe . And there 's a Shinto sect who 's asking for time , I think they 're interested in the topiary . And of course the pavements , that 's no problem . But all the rest  --  and the  --  oh , I do n't know what we shall do , it all seems so horrid  --  and some of the cherubim are quite incapable of maintaining themselves in any other en-environment ... " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved by the old saint 's grief , he had absently clawed a divot from the flowery turf . He replaced it carefully , considering . " It does seem a dreadful shame to have it all broken up , " he said . " Let 's see ; I have some figures in my head . . . but how much is a cubit , in metric ? No matter  --  I know it 'll do . Look , my old friend , it happens that I have a lot of spare room in my foregrounds . Not that there 's been any shortage of sinners . But do you recall the Doctrine of Infant Damnation ? Well , I had to set up a vast sort of nursery area for that  --  and then , thank , ah , Fate , they discontinued it . So I have some very nice real estate quite vacant , not too hot at all , and the air has nothing wrong with it that a good set of scrubbers would n't fix . But the thing is , what with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptations , my cash-flow position is n't too good . I could n't begin to pay you ? " 57  | " Oh , my goodness , " Peter interrupted him , " The price is n't the problem at all . Why , we 'd give it to someone who 'd keep it all together ! " " Well , now , that was what I rather hoped . And I do have an abundance of labor , if they can keep their smudgy little hands where they belong . " For an instant he looked quite fierce and his tail lashed . " What I 'm getting at is that if your people agreed , we could ship this whole thing down and set it up very attractively , just as if it 'd never been moved . Certain elements of the view outside might not be quite right ; but do n't I recall something about the Blessed regaling themselves by looking over the wall and watching the damned fry , was n't it ? " " Oh yes , in primitive times  --  very primitive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid ! Do you actually mean you would ? I 'm just sure the Powers and Dominions would be delighted . They 've been quite broken up about the sale . Oh , I ca n't tell you what this would mean ! " " And you could all come down for long visits , and check on our maintenance . " " Oh , yes  --  oh , I 'm quite sure ? " " Of course , " said the Devil thoughtfully , " there may be some of the newly Blessed who will be a bit confused by finding themselves headed downwards , to Hell . " " You do n't mean those evangelist chaps ? We are n't expecting them . " " You may not be , " said Satan with relish . " No , I was thinking of the people you normally get . Perhaps if we made it clear that it 's more of a museum  --  no , that would n't do either . Oh well , you 'll think of something . " " Yes , I 'm sure we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , " Satan inquired as they turned away , and the far-off light show rolled to its finale , " what 's that curious area near the Throne , where the light seems so  --  so ? " " I know what you mean , " Peter responded . " Do n't you recall ? That was the Holy Virgin 's place . And the Magdalene's. 58  | But things there have been undergoing some very puzzling changes lately . I mean they had been , before  --  b-before ? " " There , there , " said Satan . " Do n't tear yourself apart , old comrade , after we 've got one major problem solved . And I have a hunch what might be going on in the ladies ' quarter  --  we 've had a few problems ourselves .. . " But to return to practical matters . Let 's see , " he added thoughtfully , " if all goes well , my boys could start as soon as you give the word . But do n't you think someone should stay on permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do about the Book  --  or have you automated that , too ? " " Oh goodness , no ! " said the old saint emphatically . " Or rather , yes ! ? we tried it . Now that almost everyone has numbers it seemed quite promising . So we had one installed for testing ? just a few million names at first . And there were a few little  --  is bugs ' the word ? ? to unravel , things that would have been simple for any mere angel . Such as a person having more than one Social Security number . Would you believe we found one saintly lady with seventeen ? She 'd been feeding half a township . And , conversely , numbers that were attached to more than one name  --  several writers and , ah , show-biz people had dozens . But we soon got those ironed out . And in the process we discovered that quite a number of our very youngest people seemed to be most adept at such devices . So we organized them into record-keeping squads . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making music , you know . And things were wonderfully restful for me  --  for awhile . " He smiled reminiscently . " But I gather something happened ? " " Well , yes .... We began receiving the most surprising people . There seemed to be a rash of petty disasters on Earth , theatre fires and so on ; and I recall we got the entire complement of the Takewara Japanese Girls ' Volleyball Team . That was no great problem  --  but then we received the whole staff and r inmates of a Women 's Correctional Facility near Tehachapi , 59  | California . And then  --  are you familiar with an institution called the Pentagon , in the United States ? " " I am . " Satan licked his lips . " Well , it seemed that our , ah , computer had somehow made contact with its personnel records , as well as other data , and the most extraordinary things began to go wrong . It turned out that our young geniuses had grown a bit , ah , restless . And the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under congressional investigation .... " He sighed . " In the end we had to scrub the whole thing and go back to our old hand methods . " " I see , " nodded Satan . " Well , I 'm glad to know all this . I believe it might account for a period of confusion that plagued us , too . " " You did ? Oh dear  --  yes , that might well be it . Our sincere apologies . . . . And now " ? he waved toward the open Gates ? " here come our returning picnickers . I do hope the outing cheered them ! " A radiant procession of the Blessed was advancing across the outer bridge , guided by corps of seraphs and Celestial Girl Scouts . Behind them could be glimpsed a wild confusion of wings , as swan boats , riding-gryphons , hippogriffs , and other work-creatures of the air disentangled themselves from their heavenly harnesses . In the rear towered the Archangelic Presences , Michael in the lead . " They do seem a little more normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tingle the air . " Now to communicate your wonderful offer . Oy ! Sirs ! Lord Michael , look who 's here ! " The great angel turned his face toward them , and they saw his features change as he recognized the visitor . " He came to pay his respects , " Peter explained hastily . " And he 's thought of the most marvellous plan ? " " I have heard of your plans before , sir , " commented Michael stiffly . But the others gathered round , prepared to listen . " It concerns the disposition of your  --  of all this wonderful creation . " Satan gestured . " Peter tells me you 're thinking of 60  | letting it go piecemeal , and the thought gives me much pain . " As he went on to explain his proposal , he found that he felt quite strongly about it  --  so much so that he thought of another argument . " And after all , " he wound up , " think of your future incoming clientele ! They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? Who knows where they 'd end up ? " " That 's a point , Mike , " Raphael said . " I hear that Valhalla is resuming limited operations . " " H'mm , " said the great archangel , no longer so hostile . " But still , what , when they enter and find the Throne  --  as it is ? " " Well , I do have a suggestion there , though it 's more in my line than yours . Some of my younger succubi are splendid girls ; if I clean them up they 'd look really quite acceptable . I could have the best of them put it about among the Blessed , while they waited outside , of course , that He is on a difficult Creation job and got tied up . Such rumors spread fast and would satisfy people . In fact they 'd be pleased with a little inside information , as it were . It 's the not knowing . And afterward  --  well , maybe most of them will go abstract , or whatever . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son et lumiere dingus ? " Some of the younger angels gasped at that , and Michael said haughtily , " As you say , that is more in your line than ours . " But Uriel , the practical one , nodded . " Really , Mike , this might allay a great deal of natural anxiety . " " And perhaps ? " murmured Gabriel , fingering his Trump , " I know I sound foolishly optimistic , but , well , perhaps . A Return ? And then think how awful it would be if we 'd ? " Michael nodded again , and sighed a grave assent . And so it was decided . As they walked toward the Gates , Lucifer was reminded of something . " I could n't help noticing , " he remarked , shooting a glance at Peter , " that the area outside is remarkably lush and pretty . But the ground beyond your walls in my domain would be , I fear , quite dark and bare at best . Not favorable for photosynthesis . So what do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they 've been shockingly idle lately  --  and had them station themselves along the outer crevices in the wall ? That would give quite enough light to grow things , especially if someone went round now and again to remind them forcefully of their duties . They have n't a brain amongst them , and it would be a nice suitable job . With a very attractive end-result . What do you say ? Of course I would n't think of stationing any of my personnel in actual contact without your assent . " " Nicely put , " remarked Raphael . " I think it 's a very good idea ; we certainly do n't want the City just sitting on a blasted plain . " " So then we 're agreed ! " exclaimed Satan , feeling remarkably elated . He stepped to the gate , inhaling mightily . " I 'll have the first work crews up here before you know it . And of course I 'll be with them to oversee everything . . . . Do I take it that you 'd like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure all set up and waiting for  --  for the more delicate artifacts ? I imagine you can guard the perimeter yourselves for the short time required ? " " Oh , we will ! " chorused a seraphic band . " How do you plan to move whole walls ? " Uriel asked curiously . " Work-dragons . Under proper control they can cut out a portion at a time as neat as you please , and fly it down . Of course , getting it back up here would be a different story . " Satan chuckled genially . " But even so , we could probably come up with something , " he added , as he saw a shadow cross a couple of angelic visages . " Well ! " He spread his huge black wings , stepping to the sill . " D' you know , it feels fine to have a project again ! Maybe I could persuade you all to help , by selecting and gathering your favorite flower-seeds , for instance . " Daring , he added confidingly , " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to go down well ; several older angels chuckled . And with a " Farewell , all ! " he was off in a great leap through the pearly little clouds . " I hope we 've done the right thing , " said Gabe , the worrier. 62  | " Think of the alternative , " Uriel observed . They all sighed . And as they turned to go back in , Raphael was heard to mutter , " All those Moslems mucking about with my Excury azaleas . . . I just hope those dragons are careful . " " They will be , I 'm sure , " said Peter . Lucifer 's great leap outward carried him to a part of the sky where the cloudlets were few . He was feeling remarkably well , and , reminding himself that the way home was all downhill , he decided it would be pleasant to make one last flight upward , to where he could view all Heaven from above . His Heaven now , he reflected as he soared . Had he been crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be problems , of course . . . . Really , the times were growing so strange that he could scarcely trust his own motives . . . . But surely some solid evil would come of this . His old instincts for mischief were still strong . " If you ca n't beat ' em and you ca n't join ' em  --  outlive ' em ! " He chuckled in his old , nasty way , melting a small rainbow that had come too near . He mounted steadily , until , seeing a solid-looking anvil cloud above , he zoomed up over it and landed on the rim . Ah , yes  --  indeed a superb vista ! The glorious golden glitter of the thoroughfares , the jeweled park , and the great profusion of splendid mansions , from large to small , in the residential sections . He lost himself for a moment in the sheer magic of contemplation . Then he began recasting his earlier estimates , to make sure everything could be suitably installed , with enough terrain to set it off becomingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too  --  Peter had told him there was quite a queue in times of war or natural disasters . . . . The idea of poor old Peter handling a computer bank distracted him by its comicality . But there was a warning in it too , in case he himself were ever tempted to automate . Yes , there would be room enough and to spare , he concluded . 63  | He owed that to that mathematician-wallah who had calculated and impressed exponential birth-rates on him . He had cleared his infant-reception area on the fellow 's figures . . . . Maybe he 'd have him sent a cup of water , no matter what his staff thought of that . They 'd soon see his trip to Heaven had n't made him soft ! " What are you doing in my nursery ? " The clear little voice behind him startled him so that he had to shoot out his pinions for balance as he whirled . A naked girl-child stood staring at him , quite incuriously , Satan saw . What was this , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ; she wore no halo  --  and needed none , for she was radiant all over . And the cold serenity of her smile , the icy chill in her light-gray eyes , told him that he looked on something quite other than any mere celestial spirit . " You 'll have to speak louder , " the child said , although he had n't spoken . " I 'm nearly deaf . . . . You 're one of my old dreams , are n't you ? Have they told you you 'll have to move ? All this is to be mine , soon , you know . As soon as I 'm completely deaf  --  and a few other things . " " My apologies , I did n't mean to intrude . " Lucifer fairly shouted , so that the cloud began to resonate worryingly . " This is your nursery , you say ? " " Yes . But I 'm growing very fast now . Am I not , Mother ? " She glanced back at a figure so veiled and still that Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , child , you are . But I 've told you , you have to be deaf , yes , but there are also other things before you 're ready . " The child was studying Satan . " I know who you are , " she said . " And who you 're going to be . You 're Murphy ! " She giggled . It was long since the Lord of Evil had been addressed so lightly . Yet he was sure that this was no supernal innocence that mocked him . Rather it must be something new in the line of demons . Another Kali ? He shivered slightly , his tail , usually so 64  | jaunty , thrust out at an awkward , nervous angle . Kali had been relatively nothing compared to this , he felt . " And I know what you 're planning to do with that place . " She pointed down . " That 's neat . . . but Mother says I must get over liking neatness , too . I bet you do n't know who I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lucifer . " But I gather you are  --  or think you are  --  one of the people for whom space is being made . " " Not one of the people , " she giggled , then was suddenly and coldly mature . " I am the people . Tell him , Mother . " " Men used to call her Physis , ' the veiled woman said . " Now it 's Nature . ' Mother Nature . ' " She uttered a single-syllable laugh as cold as a gull 's cry . " What it will be in the future we neither know nor care . . . she made you all , you see . In her dreams . It is when she can create consciously that she will take over . The girl , abruptly a child again , made a moue . " All I 've done so far is sleep and dream and grow , " she said . " It 's very boring . " Her eyes took on a look so pale and fixed that she appeared not only deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rift opened in the cloud , so near that Satan involuntarily put out an arm to steady her , forgetting the heat of his flesh . Her little breast came against him as she straightened . He was appalled to feel a coldness quenching his very bones  --  and something else , too . " You  --  she has no heart-beat ! " he exclaimed to the veiled figure . " Naturally . She has no heart , " the woman replied indifferently . " Only her dreams have hearts . " Satan shook his head , massaging his chilled shoulder . " Evidently things will be very different , in the new order to come , " he managed to say . The figure nodded silently . Satan felt he was getting into very deep waters , but he persisted still . This might be his only chance . " And may one inquire your name , too , Ma'am ? "  | " I have n't a suitable one . Once men called my favor Tyche . Now I am called Chance . I too am powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps later I will dream again . " She stirred . " And now it is time for you to go . " " Of course . " Satan bowed his most courtly bow , making his tail curl normally . " I count myself privileged . But may I inquire about one more happening which just could concern you ? " The women inclined her veiled head . " In my , ah , humble realms there is a pit so deep that none know what lies within it . Yet recently I seemed to observe a stirring in its depths . Is it possible that one of your new order is arriving in my small province too ? " " I did n't dream that , Mother , I know , " the child exclaimed . " Arriving , you ask ? " said the woman . " Manifesting would be the better word , since if this is what I think , he is everywhere . Yes , it is possible that this is some incarnation of Entropy , my lord and spouse . He has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your realms would be a fitting place for it , if this be his whim . " " I see . . . . And , and could you tell me what I am to expect from him , if it be he ? " " Nothing new , " she returned coldly . Satan did n't like the sound of this . " Is it possible that he will wish to make use of my  --  my space as well ? " " Oh , no , Mother ! " the child interrupted . " Why , I 'd thought of moving your place to Earth , remember , Mother ? " " And you had best remember to think twice about that plan , if you wish any toys left to play with , " her mother returned . " But , " said Satan desperately , " wo n't Your Majesty have need of some place and services like mine ? Some source of final punishment for those who break your laws or commit crimes ? " " Oh , I made all that much too complicated last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I have power it will all be simple . My laws will be unbreakable . And there will be only one crime , for which everyone must pay . " 66  | " By my tail , " exclaimed Satan , impressed by the small being 's air of command . " Unbreakable laws ! That will be certainly a novelty . And only one crime , of which everyone is guilty . What could that be ? " " Being born . " The child 's icy eyes turned full on him , freezingly . Behind her the tall figure stirred significantly , reminding him that he had been dismissed . He bowed again , but received no acknowledgement . The girl was murmuring something to her mother , who listened attentively . His very presence had been forgotten . As he opened his wings and stepped off the cloud-edge , he thought he heard the child say , " Oh , I do hope that 's Daddy coming ! So I can meet him at last . " To which her mother seemed to reply , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much of him in you . " Her tone was the bleakest Satan had ever heard . To get away from them he made a great flap which bent the air to his pinions , and went hurtling , almost with his former speed , toward the familiar comfort below . Never had Hell seemed so truly homelike . Ah , he thought , checking his speed slightly to avoid vaporizing the clouds , it would be good to smell real Hellfire again . And as for whatever might be coming , or thinking of coming , out of that doubly-damned pit , well , he 'd see how it liked a few loads of lava . Better yet , divert a reliable volcano . And meanwhile he had his Heavenly affairs to see to . As the first trace of brimstone reached his nostrils , his heart warmed , though his shoulder still ached . Thinking of which , it occurred to him that he had come through this whole effort in fine shape ; that doctor was evidently a capable man . Why not surprise everyone and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , after all . Let 's see  --  what was a suitable catch ? Oh yes  --  and whirling downward in all his dark splendor , he muttered to himself : " Hands in the sands of time , Pat and putter and play ; Hands that committed crime  --  Return to him today . " There , that would teach those smart-ass goblins to be so sure 67  | they knew what the boss was going to do . And if any of them made the mistake of thinking that Heaven had softened him up , they 'd soon learn their error . Whether or not those frigid , Graecophile oneiromaniacs up there spoke truth , if they had indeed created him and all this cycle , Hell was still his , and his powers were still real . ... While they lasted , a cold echo wailed . 68  | Cold , drizzle . Dark coming on . Trucker Hagen is barrelling up the interstate in his eighteen-wheeler , trying to make time . He 's bound for Bohemia Club North , and after Carlisle the road will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The north end of the interstate has only been finished this year ; Hagen hopes they got as far as Carlisle . Darker . He switches on his lights . A mile or so behind him another pair of lights comes on . That green Celica Supra is still hanging on his ass . But a glare on the road takes his mind off it : the drizzle is freezing in the dips . Yeah , and his brakes are n't all that good . He eases down a few clicks . The lights behind him brighten briefly , then fade back again . Pacing him , all right . Hijackers , maybe , waiting to move in ? ... But the same thing had happened on other runs up here , he remembers . And nothing had come of it , nothing at all . Probably just part of the general Bohemia Club weirdness . It has a funny atmosphere , that place , he muses . All men , 69  | most of them old . Not fags , no way . But not a woman there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , some kind of shorts and badges too  --  almost like a bunch of senile Boy Scouts . Not Scouts , though  --  the place stinks of money . Very big money , if Hagen is any judge . Has its own airport ; he glimpsed several private jets . And some of the cars by the main lodge made his eyes pop . The kind of money that 's so big it hides , Hagen thinks . Hides out on uncharted islands , or like here in the mountains behind God knows how much private club property . The unmarked gate , with its gatehouse and dog patrol , is ten kilometers out from the lodge . Rich old boys pretending to be kids again , camping out in a fake wilderness . Pathetic . But they want their city luxuries  --  oh , yes . The Bohemia fridge modules that fill most of the trailer behind him are full of steaks , chops , roasts  --  meat , for God 's sake . At forty bucks a pound . Since the droughts and grain diseases finished off most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted anything resembling beef in five years . Vegburgers . Soya everything  --  and that one rotten little so-called steak he and Milly had for their anniversary ; fifty whole dollars . Even poultry got wiped out by that epidemic , and decent fish is hard to find . Hagen hates fish . But those old boys have their beef regularly . Hagen spends a minute purely loathing them . But then he remembers that the supply boss he delivers to is okay . If he 's still there , chances are he 'll bed Hagen down for the night in the help 's compound . And maybe he 'll even get a piece of real bacon with breakfast . That 'd be a nice start for the rest of his deliveries up here in ski-lodge country . Just then he hits the slick . A bad slick , very bad , running out on a curved bridge . Damn , real ice on that bridge . The clear air has momentarily fooled him . And now he sees the roadbed is graded wrong , it cants outward to a right-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gears down , down , braking all he dares . The big rig is halfway round the curve when he feels the cab wheels start to follow that outward grade . Jesus , Jesus  --  can he 70  | possibly go with it and make the turn into the interchange road ? Too sharp , no way . He 's fighting to get her off that slide , to get back on the high inside of the curve . Too late  --  too late ; the tonnage behind him is tracking the cab , with that sickening greasy feel of ice . And a big concrete divider is coming up dead ahead . Panicking , he wrenches the wheel too hard , brakes screaming ? and feels nightmares coming true . The rig is going to jackknife over him . There comes a forever minute of ghastliness  --  slow toppling , crashing , grinding  --  an impossible tilt . The wheel is in his gut , his forehead is wedged on the icy windshield . And then the beast behind him takes control of the cab , flinging it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thunder of clanging and monstrous rips-They are down . And Hagen is still alive . From somewhere below he hears the crackle start . Fire ! He gets one leg braced and heaves up at the cab door with all his might . Brokenness is all down his other side and arm . The door gives . In a pain beyond pain he crawls up and out onto the cab side , trying to see ground . The trailer has ridden partly up over the cab , split open , and from the broken fridge module a rack of cold slippery things is hanging around his head confusing everything . He bats at them , trying to see . Light is coming from somewhere now  --  that following car , he thinks dimly . It 's slowing . They have to see him . And the fire noises are getting louder  --  he has to get down out of there , has to . As he pushes through the cold things , he gets a look at them in the stranger 's headlights , and despite his agony he twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy  --  but then he sees they have little curly ends . Tails  --  pig-tails . Frozen piglet carcasses , is all . He goes sliding , scrambling down the cab side , lunging for the big front wheel . He hits it , steadies himself , sees a clear path to the ground and falls down it , crumpling as he hits . 71  | The broken oil-pan has sluiced all over his head , but he can move . Through the oil he makes out the green Supra , stopped in the ring of firelight . Two men are getting out . Hagen crawls toward them , hitching his broken side along the ground . Why do n't the men help pull him away ? Do n't they know that rig behind him is about to blow to kingdom come , do n't they know they 're in danger too ? He writhes , crawls , trying and trying to call to them for help . They 'll help him , when they understand ; they have to . Earlier that same day , in the city far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds to the L9 bus-stop , on the unfamiliar uptown side . She 's sixteen years old and her name is Maylene ; a small , zaftig , very dark black girl who moves tiredly . It has been a hard day at the K-Mart complaints terminal , a long trip home to fix up the baby and get her here . The bus as usual is very late . Maylene watches two L9s go by without stopping . By the curb is a clutter of streetpeople 's box homes . The authorities do n't bother bringing the fire-engines around here much . Maylene feels sorry for the streetpeople , but she 's afraid of them too . She hates to see them burned out . The last time there 'd been an old woman back in one of the shelters who could n't get out . The wind is icy cold . Maylene moves further back , into the shelter of the Drug Fair entrance . A gilt light falls on her from a display for PainGone . The light puts gold tints around her soft hair , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair she has painstakingly corn-rowed and tied with a yellow ribbon . The Drug Fair assistant manager , coming out to disperse the waiters , catches a look at her , and looks again . Something in the light on her narrow shoulders , the hollows under her cheekbones that came from trying to feed two on wages that barely sustain one , maybe the very large brown eyes that seem to be 72  | seeing a crazy hope invisible to the others , jogs his memory . His Aisle Nine Christmas creche display has to be finished tonight . At that moment an L9 arrives . It 's crowded , but the driver stops . Maylene squeezes aboard , last as usual . She has the right notes in her cold hand . The baby , small as it is , weighs her down ; she braces both legs , leaning against a seat-corner . She 'll have to watch carefully , she tells herself ; she 's never been this way before . Into white territory . Is that good ? Maylene ca n't tell , but closes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And luck . Then she has a feeling she should n't petition the greatness of a male God for a trivial thing like her luck . Maybe His mother will understand better , she thinks , and changes her prayer . The woman whose seat she 's leaning on suddenly jumps up and ducks away through the aisle . A black lady sitting by the window reaches for Maylene 's arm and gently pulls her down into the empty seat before the man beside them can take it . The seat feels warm . Involuntarily Maylene sighs , smiles with the comfort . " How old 's she ? " The lady is smiling at Maylene 's baby , who opens her own huge eyes and smiles her unearthly smile . " Two months . " Maylene hopes the lady wo n't go on . As if catching the thought  --  or perhaps just too tired  --  the lady sits back up and rides to her stop with no more than a " Good luck , clear . " Now they were coming into an odd part of the city  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings , that sprang up after the bulldozers knocked down people 's homes . What they called slum-clearance . Maylene unfolded the paper clenched in her hand and peered out . 7005 . . . 7100 .. . the next block would be it , 7205 . Yes , there 's the sign , gold on white like an expensive candybox . The Center is on the ground floor of one of the little office buildings , with a big car park at the side . It is about half full . Just as Maylene gets out and starts towards the Center 's doors , there 's a snarl of truck gears and a man 's voice cursing . A huge 73  | truck comes backing out of the car park and turns heedlessly across the walk . Maylene glances across the cars and sees his trouble : a big fat pipe runs from the second storey of 7205 to the small manufacturing plant next door , with a sign saying CAUTION , 13 FEET 7 INCHES . Steam , or something , Maylene thinks absently , all her mind on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , she scurries up the pathway . The double-doors say in gold script , " Come in ! Come in ! Welcome ! For Blessed are they that give Life . " And then , in the lower corner , " RIGHT-TO-LIFE ADOPTION CENTER NO. 7 . " Maylene stops , her baby held so tightly that it murmurs . She ca n't go in . But there 's another woman coming behind her . This gives Maylene strength to pull open the door and hold it for the other , a gray-haired , drawn-faced , white woman lugging a large , angry-looking infant wearing an engineer 's cap . Behind her Maylene sees other figures converging on the Center . Most carry babies , but there 's a childless couple  --  no , two . People looking to adopt babies ? Maylene sighs and goes on in , wondering if one of those couples will take her baby away . She 's in a warm , bright room , facing a plastic-padded counter , behind which white-clad nurses are coming and going . But she has time only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals in dresses  --  mice , maybe  --  and that there 's a row of empty high-chairs by the counter , before a nurse is beside her and the other mother . " You 've come in the wrong side , my dears . " The nurse ? she 's white , like everyone Maylene can see here  --  urges them back . " Unless you 'd like to adopt another pretty little baby ? " No smiles from Maylene and the other . The child in the cap lets out a loud squall . The door marked " Baby Reception " is next to the one they 'd come in . Inside is also warm and bright , with another padded counter . The walls are papered with foreign-looking flowers . Several mothers are ahead of Maylene , talking about their babies to the nurses behind the counter . Each place at the 74  | counter has little side-walls for privacy , like in a bank . The nurses seem kindly and patient . But Maylene is wondering if her little one will be expected to eat sitting in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms ; Maylene could never have afforded a high-chair in any event . Will her baby be frightened , or cold ? Her baby  --  oh , how she dreads to give her up . She 's the only thing Maylene has ever had all to herself ; the love between them is like a living current . She does n't dare even think about the ( lays ahead , alone .. . Whoever had given it to her she will never know . One of her brothers had found out where she lived , and suddenly he showed up at her room one night with bottles and what seemed at least a dozen wild young men ; one or two of them looked white . He 'd forced the drink down her , holding her neck and nose until she gagged it in . After that she recalled less and less , and finally nothing . . . but only came to in the morning alone and naked and sick , in a torn-up room . She 'd used no precautions , of course . She had no men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't been quite a virgin ; there 'd been that terrible afternoon with her uncle when she was eight . And of course she knew what it meant when she started throwing up . But quite soon she discovered that she very much wanted this baby . Even before she was born Maylene felt she knew her . The birth was n't too bad , and after that their weeks together had given her all the joy she 'd ever really known . But then she started fainting at work , and the doctor at K-Mart laid down the law . She could n't buy the baby 's supplements and feed herself , too . And she might harm her child . " People who adopt children take the very best care of them , " the doctor told her . " They want them so much . " So here she is , feeling like death . Suddenly these thoughts are sent flying  --  a white girl waiting behind Maylene stamps past her up to the counter , dumps her 75  | baby on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You made me have him . Take him ! He 's yours . " She whirls and heads for the doors . " Oh  --  but . Oh , Miss  --  Missus  --  you ca n't ! You have to sign a release ! " A nurse darts around the end of the counter to intercept the girl . But the girl is big , and determined . " Release ? " she mimicks . " Hell ! " She slams out the doors . An older nurse in the background is calling at an intercom : " Doctor Gridley ? Oh , Doctor Gridley ! " From outside comes the racket of a car starting roughly . It accelerates away . A tall man in doctor 's whites comes out through a door in the back wall . " Another dumper ? " " I 'm afraid so , doctor . We were a little crowded here for a few minutes . " " Well , just stick an X ' on an orange label and I 'll doublecheck it . " He sighs . " Damn . " Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Now it begins to gurgle softly and turns its face toward Maylene . Something is wrong with it , she sees . Dreadfully wrong . It seems to have no upper lip , and there 's what looks like part of another mouth , or face , merged into its cheek . And its legs and one arm are all short and twisted , too , and it 's wearing a smeared bandage-thing instead of a little jacket . But it gurgles and slobbers happily enough while a nurse bundles a baby-blanket around it and lays it in a crib-cart . She ties a big orange label on the cart handle , and holds it up for the older nurse to mark . " Doctor wo n't have to do much checking on this one , " the nurse smirks . The older woman , who seems to be the Head here , shakes her head crossly at the girl . Maylene sees that all the newly-filled crib-carts have colored labels tied on them . Some have big letters : " CS , " " DF , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wheel them into the back room . The girl ahead of her turns away sharply , bumping Maylene . Oh-h-h  --  it 's her turn . She slowly steps up to the counter , but her arms wo n't loosen .  | Unable to do anything at all , she stares mutely up into the face of the head nurse . She looks down at Maylene 's delicate little figure with its buttoned bodice , and understanding comes . " I bet your baby is breast-fed . " " Uh ? Oh , yes , " whispers Maylene . " What will ... " " Not to worry . We have two grand wet-nurses here . " The nurse turns to the back . " Oh , Mrs. Jackson ! Are you free ? " " Coming ! " Mrs. Jackson is a large , gloriously endowed , Indian-red , warmly-smiling lady . In no time Maylene finds herself releasing her precious armload into the other 's friendly , capacious grasp . Mrs. Jackson 's bodice falls open and the little corn-rowed head burrows greedily into the source of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have much milk ... " " Poor little creature , " Mrs. Jackson croons impartially . " We just slip a warm bottle to her one day when she 's feeding , and she 'll learn so fast you would n't believe it , " the head nurse tells Maylene . " Now , dear , there 's only this little paper to sign , right here . You take my pen . " As Maylene goes out , numb , empty-armed , several pairs of hopeful parents are crowding in across the way . An idea comes to her : if she can just find a spot to wait out of the wind , maybe she 'll see who takes her baby . She can see that bright yellow bow a long way away . The six middle-aged people coming up the Center pathway are clearly not prospective parents , although they turn to the Adoptions door . They are , in fact , the Right-to-Life Committee , or rather one of those few remnants of the Right-to-Life movement whose interest in other people 's babies had persisted after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . They come shivering into the bright room , hugging coats about them and exclaiming about the cold , to find six easy-chairs ranged invitingly along the lefthand wall . Head Nurse Tilley 77  | hurries out through the small crowd around the counter to welcome them . They can see the high-chairs , now occupied , and several white plastic baby-baskets on the counter , almost hidden by three sets of excited parents-to-be . Occasional glimpses of waving pink toes appear from the baskets ; the future parents coo . The Committee comprises four women and two men , who seem well acquainted with Nurse Tilley . When they 're settled down , and a nurse 's aide has offered hot coffee , cocoa or tea , Nurse Tilley produces her accounts file and presents it on a lapboard for the group 's accountant , Mrs. Pillbee , to examine . The other members turn beaming smiles on the infants and the adoptions in progress . In the high-chairs are picture-pretty babies , all dressed in the Center 's white teddy-suits with different-coloured bows on their baby forelocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an enchanting brunette in a gorgeous cornflower-blue hair-bow who is so pale it 's impossible to be sure of its race . " Just to think , " says Mrs. Dunthorne , the Committee 's leader , " if it had n't been for our work , all these lovely , lovable little people would have been murdered . Murdered in the womb by unnatural mothers ! " Her voice becomes choked , she dabs at her eyes with a scrap of lace . " A Constitutional Amendment , " she says reverently . " To think that the terrible crime of abortion is forbidden forever now ! Oh , we owe so much to you , Mr. Seymour . No one could have fought harder against those cold , heartless people . " She sneezes , and gets up to take a closer look at the babies in the baskets . A moment later she 's joined by the lady who was sitting on Mr. Seymour 's other side . " If only he 'd have it cleaned , " Mrs. Dunthorne whispers to her friend . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful odor of formaldehyde . Her friend nods , also dabbing her nose . " I expect he 's not too well off . " " But is he going to spend the winter in it ? I mean , no one  | could be a nobler soul  --  Oh , you cunning wee thing , " Mrs. Dunthorne says hastily as a nurse goes by . Head Nurse Tilley is also glancing curiously at Mr. Seymour . She has long known him as the flaming figure of outrage who produced trimester fetuses in bottles at legislative hearings , and thrust them full at the TV cameras so the little faces and fingers showed , demanding to know who in the audience could kill or deliberately tear apart this " beautiful little person ? " The TV had not , however , shown the last Alabama ratification hearing , when Mr. Seymour had manipulated his bottles with so much emotion that one broke in his pocket , and he had bolted for the corridor crying , " Get this thing off me ! " Mrs. Dunthorne and others had surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it is becoming clear that someone  --  perhaps their new male member , Mr. George ? ? must tactfully raise the question of coat-cleaning . Mr. George , at the moment , is questioning Nurse Tilley . He seems to have more interest in figures and details than Mrs. Pillbee . Nurse Tilley is all smiles ; she has never been sure how far the Committee was clued into the Center 's total operations ? the operations that made the Center possible  --  so she played it safe . These people might still be under the illusion that the trickle of adoptions and voluntary contributions could do it all . " That 's right , " she says . " All one hundred and thirty-four infants cleared for adoption have found parents since your last visit . Plus six in long-term hospital care . I 'm happy to say we even found a home for one mild case of Down 's syndrome . The mother had been told that hers would be a Down 's baby , and when she found she could n't obtain an abortion , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat until her life was threatened so she had to be forcibly fed . But the child survived all this and came to us . The adoptive father is a child psychologist who believes Down 's babies can be greatly helped . " Murmurs of gratification . " Oh , my , " Mrs. Dunthorne exclaims , " Mr. Seymour , we  | simply must get more publicity for the work our Centers are doing ! Would n't that help you , my dear ? " Nurse Tilley assents a trifle dubiously , as Mr. George breaks in . " Now tell me , Nurse . You show the adoption rate of babies that are cleared . But I do n't see your total intake , your holding of babies both cleared and uncleared . " Nurse Tilley smiles harder . " Oh , that figure can be reconstructed for any day , even any hour you choose . " She shuffles papers expertly . " But frankly we have n't found it useful , because , among other things , times vary so wildly . It can happen that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in two hours , while another one with a case of the sniffles is held for two weeks . And if a baby is suspected of a communicable childhood disease , it can mean holding quarantine for a large group . You know how some mothers are about vaccinations . . . " Her tone is pointed and there are responsive sighs , as if she had held up a cue card saying " Black Welfare Mothers . " " And weekends  --  the labs are closed , you see , but people come anyway ; even the time of day makes a difference ? " She chats on automatically , trying to dispel the image behind her eyes that haunts her life  --  the vision of babies , babies , babies inexorably being born , unrelentingly flooding down over Center Seven and the rest . Sometimes she felt she would drown in surplus babies , babies at first individual , tragic , then finally only figures . Figures which bore no relation to the hundred and thirty-four she had cited to the Committee . Numbers which her job depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? and people holding responsible jobs tend to come in to adopt quite late in the day , even at night . We never close . So our population fluctuates . " Big smile . She hopes it will quiet Mr. George . But he has one more question . " Do I understand that you keep them all on these premises ? " " Oh , yes . We have plenty of room back there , and luckily we 've been able to obtain some holding space upstairs too . Of  | course , we have a full pediatric staff , a cook , and two wet-nurses for infants that need weaning . Excuse me , is something wrong , Miss Fowler ? " While she was speaking , several couples have made their selections , checked in at the legal desk , and gone . But one couple is upset . The woman 's voice is loud , touched with hysteria . " But there must be one , Nurse . We called . " The nurse at the counter explains . " They had their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone in our family , " the woman cried , " everyone has golden hair and blue eyes . Show them , Hugo ! " Rather sheepishly , the man pulls off his fur cap , revealing a crest of ruddy gold . His eyes , like the woman 's , are bright blue . " I know this is a darling baby " ? the woman gestures at a basket ? " but her eyes are hazel . It 's no use , Hugo . Let 's get out of here . " " Oh wait , please , " says Nurse Tilley . " I see we must let you in on our little secret . First , please , can I count on you to keep something really confidential ? " Puzzled , the couple nod . " Very well . Miss Fowler , would you bring in the blue-ticket basket in the reserved ? " her voice drops to a murmur . Miss Fowler nods and goes . While they wait , Nurse Tilley explains . " You see , my dears , there 's such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we displayed them normally , the others who may be lovelier and better in their own right would n't he looked at . And people would even quarrel over them ? dreadful . So we reserve these few for people like you , with a special need . By the way , the baby I have in mind is a girl . Does that make a difference ? " " Oh , no ! Oh  --  that 's what we ? " Smiling , Nurse Tilley holds a finger to her lips and they fall silent . In a moment Miss Fowler comes back in , carrying a white baby-basket . Nurse Tilley glances over and nods her head , Yes . The basket is placed before the waiting blond couple . Miss 81  | Fowler opens a dimity flap to display the infant . The Committee , staring frankly , see them both gasp a long breath , and then explode together in almost incoherent expressions of delight . Miss Dunthorne and Mrs. Pillbee edge closer to look . In the Center 's white blanket lies a peaches-and-cream baby ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little green bow , and her large eyes look up with the deepest gentian-blue gaze the ladies have ever seen . In the gaze is a beguiling hint of curiosity , and she smiles with great sweetness . " She 's just been fed , she does n't feel too active , " Nurse Tilley tells the enraptured future parents . The brilliant blue gaze hides as the baby 's eyelids droop . She yawns like a kitten , then looks up again at the huge faces pressing lovingly toward her . Nurse Tilley continues smiling automatically as the papers are filled out , the deliriously happy adopters dropping pens in their reluctance to free hands of their treasure . The nurse 's work over the years has taught her much about infant development , and she has carefully observed this angelic-looking child . What she has been watching is a trace of  --  call it slowness . Perhaps it will wear off . But in her heart of hearts , Nurse Tilley has a prevision . That wonderful blue , blue , faintly questioning stare , that smile , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development will probably be okay . But by the time she 's about ten the smile will begin to lose its charm , and the little problems with reading and math will begin to loom larger . With puberty , the reactions will begin to change from exasperation to tragedy . And then . . . Nurse Tilley 's vision ends in the unchanging light of an institutional day-room , where a graying blonde woman will look up from the picture magazine with that same bright blank wondering smile . And the peaches-and-cream forehead will wrinkle as she wonders why the kind people who 'd taught her to say " Mummy " and " Daddy " do n't come around any more . . . Nurse Tilley shakes herself . She could be wrong  --  she has to be wrong . And the couple had asked for a blue-eyed blond . Which was what they had , no more , no less . From outside comes  | the quiet starting of a big , expensive car . Nurse Tilley has checked enough to know that money at least will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden away back there ? " one of the ladies is asking . " Oh , no  --  just when we get an unusual type someone might ask for . Oh ! Oh , Mister George ! We do n't go back there , if you please . " But the quiet Mr. George has quietly vanished through the doors to the back room , with Nurse Tilley in hot pursuit . She has him back in a moment . " I should have explained . We do try to keep conditions as near sterile as possible . Of course they 're not truly sterile , but for instance we wear different shoes from our counter ones . And feeding is just over . If one baby gets frightened of a stranger you could have the whole place yelling and losing their dinners . And the doctors are doing their rounds . If you 'd care to watch , I should have opened this for you ? " She draws back a vertical blind to reveal a big plate-glass viewport in the back wall . Long lines of crib-carts can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paper shoe-covers , if you 'd be so good . " As the group gets shod and shuffles to the glass , Mr. George says drily , " That fellow in the red cap and bloody sheet does n't look very sterile to me . " " No , he does n't . And I 'm going back there right now to find out what 's going on . If you 'll excuse me ? " She leaves the party clustered around the viewport . Through it they can see Doctor Gridley and his two colleagues working down a line of cribs quite near . The babies ' temperatures are being taken . Mrs. Pillbee turns away , slightly pink around the nose . In the middle distance Nurse Tilley has intercepted the strange figure , a man in workman 's clothes covered with a blood-stained sheet worn like a cape . He 's holding one forearm with the other . Doctor Gridley goes over to 83  | speak to Nurse Tilley . He gestures to the man 's feet , and the watching group sees the man is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling , comes back out to them . " An emergency , " she explains . " Really life or death . One of the workmen in the plant next door got his hand caught under a blade and nearly severed it . Bleeding terribly , of course . They made a tourniquet and took him to the back door here because they knew we had a doctor . He even had the sense to kick off his boots before he came in . Poor fellow . There 's a good chance he 'll keep the use of his fingers because the doctor got to it so quickly . But if he 'd had to wait for an ambulance he might well have died from loss of blood . I can assure you , Mr. George , that this sort of thing does n't happen often ! Well ! Is there anything else you 'd like to look over ? " " Lots of black kids over on the far side there , " remarks Mr. George , still peering . " I suppose you quarantine them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure chance tonight . See , there 're whites among them if you look . " Eyes followed Mr. George 's gaze to the right side of the big room , where crib after crib holds a small black head ; several of them wear colored bows . The back wall of the room turns into an offset , where a medical station might be , and the group of crib-carts is lined up as if awaiting treatment . A medico carrying a trayful of little syringes is at the line . " What 's he going to do ? " asked Mrs. Pillbee . " Vaccina-tions ? " " No , I think not , that 's usually done individually . I think that 's the evening shot . Vitamins , and an infant tranquilizer . One of our worries is that a restless baby might start the whole roomful howling just before bedtime . " She glances at her watch . " I think that 's what 's going on now  --  he 's putting them to sleep . " " What does DF mean ? " another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . DF ... D' you know I ca n't remember ! I know BF means Breast-Feed ' , and CS means Cleared for Show ' and an orange tag means all data missing  --  the mother just dropped it  | and ran away . DF . . . must be something to do with vaccinations . " " Are there really that many black families wanting to adopt a baby ? " asks a lady who has n't spoken before . " Looks like it ! " Nurse Tilley laughs . " Of course , they may all give out suddenly . But we absolutely discourage cross-racial adoptions , " she adds soberly . " It 's not fair to the child . One thing about black adoption , you see much more of parents who already have two , three , even four kids adopting another , or even two . With whites it 's your childless couples who adopt . Anything more ? No ? " Coats and scarves are retrieved . " Of course , you can always go over and watch the receiving side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've seen the happy endings of a few little stories , but at the input you get a steady diet of depressing scenes . Of course you might be interested in the unobtrusive methods we have for keeping new babies quarantined , and I 'm very proud of the staff over there , they do a wonderfully sympathetic job at high speed . If one dawdles about sympathizing too much , you know , people break down and lose their resolution to do the right thing . Takes quite a knack . I 'm proud of those girls . But there does n't seem much point in your depressing yourselves after you 've seen how well most things turn out , does there ? " The Committee could n't agree with her more . Outside , the wind has grown even colder . Maylene ca n't find a sheltered spot where she can see the doorway well enough . The plant next door is working on night shift , but when Maylene goes close to it her view is blocked by two big trucks . Finally a Burger King trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which she can keep watch on the Adoptions door . She 's right under that pipe from the plant to the Center , it should shed some heat . But just as she 's getting warm , a guard comes and shouts at her . She ca n't hear what he 's saying because of a rumbling , 85  | scratching sound in the pipe overheard , more like a conveyor belt than steam . But his gestures are unmistakable  --  he wants her away from there . Maybe he thinks she 's a streetwoman . But she has to go . And anyway , the vent and the rubbish smell bad . So she just keeps walking fast , to and fro in front of the Center . As she 's about to freeze , a girl 's voice calls softly , " You watching the door ? " " Uh  --  yes . " " Not there . Round here . They come out the side . " The girl ducks back into the car park and Maylene follows to the shelter of an old van . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a light over it . At that moment a couple come out with a baby in a plastic shell-basket . Maylene gets a good look at the baby 's head . No bow . " You fix a ribbon on your baby ? " " Yeah . Red , with some gold stuff in it . " " Mine 's yellow . " " I wonder , do they take them off ? " " Do n't say it . " They have to step back for a white couple coming out with a baby in one of the shell-like plastic baskets ; the Center must give them away . The baby has pale straw-colored hair . The woman is carrying him , and as they go round the van , Maylene hears her say , " That 's weather , darling . This is cold weather . Oh you 'll get to love it , you 'll have a little sled  --  Oh , Charles , is n't he adorable ? Just exactly what we dreamed of . " The man halts to look . " Yeah , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . we better get him in the car before we freeze his little nuts off . " " Charles ! " she giggles . A weary-looking older white woman comes walking slowly around the corner from the main door . She halts by the van 's driver 's side and starts fumbling with keys . Then she sees them . " Oh  --  I 'm so s-sorry ? " And then she 's crying openly , leaning her head on the van . Uncertainly , the girls go around to her .  | " Oh , I 'm sorry . . . D-do n't mind me , it 's j-just a mistake , it 's all a terrible mistake . " She 's crying so hard , silently , that her body shakes the van . " Ma'am , you should n't drive like this , " says Maylene 's new acquaintance , whose name is Neola . " Is there something we can do for you ? " " N-no . " The woman 's head swings from side to side , despairingly . " A mistake  --  look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I was through with all that , I thought there was n't any danger , and we did n't take any  --  and then the doctor took another test and told me the baby was defective . Bad defective . And it would cost like thirty thousand dollars so it could even walk . We do n't have any thirty thousand dollars , all we have is just the money for our girl 's college . And so I decided to have an abortion , but they said that was illegal now . I had to h-have it . And it tore me all up inside , when you 're older , you 're not flexible like a girl . " She lifts her head and stares at them despairingly , adding in a low voice , " When you looked at her from a certain angle she did n't look defective , you know . Just for a second she 'd look really pretty . Like she might have been if I had n't been so old . Oh-h-h . . . oh dear , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough . When I was in the hospital first there was a little girl who 'd been raped by four men including her own father  --  and they would n't help her . I heard later she tried somewhere illegal and died . That 's trouble , I should n't boo-hoo . " She looks around disorientedly , then at the keys in her hand . " My dears , I have to take this junk-pile out . Where can you stand ? You 're watching the door , right ? " " Yeah . Oh , we 'll find a place . " " Easier said . It 's colder'n a bitch . " Hearing her own words she laughs jeeringly . But there just is no shelter . The cars beyond the van are all knee-high compacts , except one truck at the far end . " We 'll go down there . " " Where you ca n't see the door . Oh , dear . " The woman looks 87  | across the mid-lane to the row of cars opposite . " Could you see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all jump as a horn taps melodiously right opposite . A car door opens , and a formidably chic , young , pale-skinned black woman leans out . " You watching for your kids ? " Her accent is markedly " white . " " Yes . " Maylene is intimidated by this spectacular creature . " So am I. I was going to ask if you want to sit in here with me where it 's warm . You can see perfectly . " " Oh , yes thank you . " " Well that solves the problem , " says the white mother of the defective child , getting laboriously into the van . She drives away , and Maylene and her new acquaintance climb timidly into the warm velour interior of the fanciest car they 've ever been in . The light-skinned woman says , " Only one problem . If I see someone with my son I 'm going to follow them . That 's why I have the car facing out . You may have to get out in kind of a hurry  --  but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Follow them ? " Maylene asks , surprised . " Yes . I want to see who they are and where and how they live . Oh , I 'm not going to make trouble or anything . They 'll never know I know  --  but I want to keep track as long as I can . " " Oh , I wish I 'd thought of that , " said Maylene wistfully . " But of course I do n't have a car . " " Hmm . . . " The strange young woman is evidently turning this over in her mind , trying to figure some way to help , but there seems no way . " A taxi , maybe ? " Maylene laughs . The stranger picks up her real leather purse . " Look ? " " Oh , I could n't , I just could n't , " Maylene protests . Reluctantly , the young woman puts the purse away . " Did you bring your baby in ? " " Yes . . . and she 's , uh , breast-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other says relievedly , " I hate to tell you , but she wo n't be coming out today . They wean them first . " " Have you been waiting long ? " asks Neola . " Six hours . I do n't know why . It 's crazy , but I have this hunch ... " " Did you put a ribbon or something so you can be sure ? " " Yes . A big blue headband . " " Mine 's red and gold , and hers is yellow , " said Neola . " We were wondering , do they take them off ? " The girl sighs . " Yes . That 's another trouble . I guess they leave them on if they 're going to show them right away , but they probably come off tonight . The first day must be the only time you really have a chance , unless you get close enough to see its face . I s'pose that 's all my hunch is , really  --  just a last chance . " There 's a silence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but none of the babies wears a bow . " God , you hear some stories , " the pale woman says reflectively . " Yeah . " " Are you one of the tragic ones ? Do n't mind my asking , I 'm kind of a reporter . I 'm going to do a piece on this , believe it . " " No , " says Maylene sadly , " I just could n't feed us both . I 'm a K-Mart Company trainee , and they take so much out of the pay they said we 'd get . " " Me too , " says Neola . " Only I 'm at an airline , learning computerized reservations . They say , when you get good and are due for your full salary , they fire you and hire other trainees because it 's cheaper and the new girls are almost as good because they try so hard , see ? " " Sweethearts , " the reporter girl says acidly . She pulls out a notebook and asks them for some facts and numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Why did you have to give up your baby ? " she asks daringly when the strange girl puts her pad away . " I did n't exactly have to . I wanted to because I hate his 89  | damned father . I thought he was my friend , see , not to marry , but like a real deep friendship that would last . . . and he 's great , politically . " She notices their blank expressions . " I mean , he seemed to be all for women , and ERA , and real equality , etcetera , etcetera . Yak-yak . One afternoon I happened to pick up the extension while he was chatting with a man chum , and I learned a whole lot in a big hurry . Among other points his advice was , always keep your women pregnant : a little bit pregnant . ' Notice that women , ' too . Plural . He was n't just talking macho , he meant it , he was giving real advice to a pal on how to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . And then I tried the abortion route , I guess you know all about that . . . " She sighs . " I 'd imagined we could sort of raise the baby together , you know  --  Oh , I did n't expect him to do housework , we were n't living together . But I thought he 'd be  --  like  --  there . Now it seems he has kids all over town he 's never seen . The great revolutionary . Keep ' em barefoot and pregnant . " She laughs the strangest , hardest laugh Maylene has ever heard . " Oh , " say the other two girls together , not understanding much except the pain . " But you could keep your baby ? " Maylene asks . " Correction . His baby . His little pregnancy . You know how he did it ? He punches pinholes in his condoms . And I thought he was so nice and considerate , wearing them . Because my doctor says the pill is bad for my heart . Pinholes ! And I think once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want the pinhole baby , thank you . " Maylene can sort of not quite almost understand . At that moment the front seat fairly leaps under them as the strange girl jerks upright to see better . " It 's him ! It 's him ! They 've got my baby ! " Across the street , a light tan couple are laughing over a white baby basket out of which sticks a little head with a big blue bow . The girl is quietly turning the motor on . " Listen kids , I 'm sorry but this is as far as we go . Oh God ,  | they 're getting into that Mercedes . Look , here 's what you do . Go straight in that side door and look around hard and fast at the babies on show . Then sit down as if you 're expecting somebody . Make up a name , say anything  --  Mrs. Howard Jellicoe . Tell ' em she told you to wait . Get it ? They 'll let you stay long enough to be sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  I hate to say it  --  I 'm afraid you 've had it . It 's getting late . Of course , you could always try tracking them legally , claim there 's an inheritance or something . " The girls are out now . She pulls the brake off . Down the row , a silver-colored car is quietly backing out towards them . " Goodbye , kids . Good luck . Remember , walk straight in ! " The silver car is pulling out of the far exit . Their temporary benefactrix accelerates smoothly after it . " You know , " says Neola , " I do n't think she hates that baby so bad . " Maylene nods . Their own plight strikes home on a blast of icy wind . " I 'm scared , " Maylene says . " So 'm I. But we 're together , the worst they can do is tell us to leave . We are n't breaking any law . Come on now . Come on . " They go up to the Adoptions door and enter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frisking on the walls . In her panic , she forgets all about Mrs. Howard Jellicoe . But Nurse Tilley , guessing their trouble and knowing how cold it is outside , lets them stay quite a long while , and even look through the window to the back . The long lines of cribs bewilder and discourage them . Just as they 're about to turn away , they see a nurse pick up something from the floor by the cribs  --  a full plastic bag . " That poor man from the plant must have dropped this , " they hear her say , holding it up . " But whatever is it ? " One of the doctor-looking men comes over and looks . " Pigtails ! " He snorts . " Piggy-wigs ' tails ! " He shakes his head and goes away . " Yech , " says the nurse , going to a side door .  | After one last despairing look , Maylene and Neola turn away . It 's clear that no red or yellow ribbons are waiting to be shown this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange men who are looking silently at his crashed truck . " Help ! " With his good hand he paws a leg , tries to pull himself up . The crackling noises behind him sound bad . What 's the matter with these guys ? he wonders foggily . Do n't they know they 're in danger ? When that tank blows " Help ! " he moans . " Danger . . . fire ! Pull me back ! Please , help ... " The man whose leg he clutches neither helps nor resists , but says something to his companion that Hagen ca n't hear . Then Hagen has an idea . These men must be hijackers , watching their target going up in smoke . With tremendous effort he tells them , " Meat . Only meat . Do n't die for meat . " He coughs , agonized . By his face on the ground is something peculiar . A bloody , white pig 's tail with thread hanging out of the frozen end where it had been knocked off . Some kind of blurry realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Vomit shoots out of his mouth and nose onto the strange man 's shoes . The shoes back away  --  Oh , God , are they leaving him ? Oh , no " Listen , " he gasps with all his fading strength . " I know where the safe is . The safe  --  money . Help me and I 'll show you . After it blows . But for Christ 's sake get me out of here now ! " At last the man above him bends down . " Okay . We 'll help you , but you have to look over here . " He snaps his fingers beyond Hagen 's ear . " Try . " Too confused to wonder , in very bad pain , Hagen turns his head towards the man 's snapping fingers . He never sees the crowbar as it swings down and ends his life . Alive , Hagen would have recognized what had happened to  | his head . He had seen skulls crushed in just such a pattern before . No doctor who 'd ever worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulch in Hagen 's skull now : roll-bar impact . He has barely slumped in death before the strange men begin hauling his body up over the bottom of the truck and jamming it into the cab . Hup  --  Hup  --  Slam  --  and they 're off the truck , legging it for the Celica Supra yet managing to avoid the gushing oil . Cool types . The Supra backs across the bridge like a rocket , just as ? Whomp ! The whole crumpled nine-axle rig leaps at the sky and collapses in a sea of blue and red flames . But instead of heading out of there , the Supra pulls over , headlights off , and waits while the flames roar orange and yellow , sending a stench down the cold wet wind . Presently they 're only isolated pyres around the great tangled skeleton . No other cars come by . As soon as they can , the Supra moves back to the wreck and the men get out with handlights . The stink is now ferocious . One man begins walking methodically around the wreckage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other goes up to the charred cab , handkerchiefs wound around his hands against the heat , and satisfies himself that the contents of Hagen 's metal-jacketed pad of invoices for his coming deliveries are charred into black powder . He sweeps his torch around to make sure that any papers which Hagen might have stashed in niches in the cab are beyond recognition . Neither man makes any effort to search for the safe . Suddenly the man on the ground grunts and holds up part of a freezer module on which can be read the letters " BOHEMIA CL . " It 's a freakish accident caused by melting ice-lumps . It might interest prying eyes . Prying eyes are very much disliked by aging oligarchs , who consider it none of the public 's business what they choose to do or eat . It was to prevent just such a one-in-a-million mishap that 93  | men like those in the Supra are employed to escort certain sensitive loads . Their job is to remove any potentially embarrassing leads to the Bohemia Club . So the printed board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames , along with a few organic bits and pieces which survived the blast in recognizable form . Soon they 're satisfied . They return to the Supra , obliterating the footsteps behind them with scraps of insulation , which go in the Supra 's trunk . As the driver gets in , there comes a flash over the low hills in the highway ahead . It 's the lights of a police patrol car , appearing and disappearing in the dips at a dawdling pace . It will accelerate when the driver spots the wreck 's glow . Briefly , the men squint ahead . They wo n't need lights . The moon 's now showing through ragged , racing clouds , light enough to get them to that wooded side turning they can wait in till the cop goes by . Then they can ease back onto the interstate , and hit the Supra 's speed . Their employers must be promptly informed that the expected supplies wo n't be arriving , and have to be reordered . The car gets into motion while the man beside the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked lump of muck on his heel . " Hold it . " The lump is rapidly knocked off  --  unburned wet sawdust around something that curls shiny yellow , as if it were nasty life . The man hits it to the ground outside with his torch , and takes a closer look . It 's only a muddy tag-end of yellow cloth . Nothing at all . Cursing himself for getting jittery , he slams the car door . Next instant they 're gone . Nothing at all . Except of course to a zaftig little girl who 'd prayed to God 's mother for luck . She was right to pray so ; her official God has long been growing increasingly gerontomorphic . From the smooth-faced idealistic young God who had driven the money-changers from the Temple , He has become a heavybrowed , bull-necked deity , more concerned with the effects of  | currency rates on national economies in the light of the IMF 's commitments , and His diplomatic and territorial relations with other similar gods ; in short , a more civilized version of His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to the higher , softer voices of women and children . It is a millennium now since He has heard a bird sing , and sparrows have been falling unheeded for a very long time indeed . His Mother , of course , can hear such voices , and is often thereby greatly moved . But , like all female deities when the Bull Gods take over , She has almost no powers left . Small things like Maylene 's luck she can sometimes help with . And who shall say that it was n't luck which , by improbable stages , moved a torn , bloodied , yellow ribbon from the meat-packing plant rubbish pile where Maylene might see it , to a burning truck hundreds of miles away , thereby retaining , in Maylene 's huge brown eyes , the wholly unrealistic light of hope ? 95  | There is a tale that is recounted to young children , as the family gathers round the Heat-O'Stat on a chilly night . When one of the boys has displayed too firm an intention to have his cake and eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remember the crown prince 's wedding night ! " Here is the story . To appreciate it , we need to set the stage . We have first a small nation named Ecologia-Bella , which is perfectly charming . All the men are hardy and handsome and considerate , all the women are talented and delightful and exactly five feet three inches tall , which was determined ( by popular vote ) to be the ideal height for love . This populace is not all of one race , but is of the same culture ; a satisfying place has been made available for everyone , and all preventable misfortune is disallowed . The scenery of Ecologia-Bella is sumptuous , running from snow-capped mountains through rich forests and lakes and flower-strewn meadows to long tropic beaches of pink-white sand with a wondrous coral reef to play in.  | Ecologia-Bella has industries , which are by design highly labor-intensive ( which is why places can be found for all ) . Most of the women make exquisite embroidered gossamer wool cloths , which are so much valued in other countries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one . And they are paid for in gold . International fashion-setters have their favorite designers , and pounce on everything that comes from their looms . And the women of Ecologia prudently change the colorings and styles every year or so , that no one may collect them all . The men of Ecologia-Bella grow woodlots , which they cut in rotation to make the finest , acid-free , beautifully watermarked paper , much sought after by wealthy letter-writers , and primarily used for documents of state and the recorded sayings of titled nonentities so cherished by other governments . For this paper , payment is in pure silver . And when a woodlot is to be cut , rattlers and clappers are installed in it to discourage birds and small animals from nesting there until all is safe again . For those men and women who do n't choose to weave or make paper , a wealth of other occupations is open , such as making music in the streets , sweeping chimneys , raising sheep , composting the trash , and running the government . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . All this requires energy , which Ecologia-Bella has in plenty . Its rivers cascade from the heights , and the less scenic of these falls have been harnessed for clean electric power . Some of the electricity is used to extract hydrogen from the sea-water ; the hydrogen is then mixed with a finely-powdered metal , which forms a non-explosive hydride . The hydride flows , so it can be pumped through pipelines or canned and trucked to filling stations all over the country , much as we do with petroleum products . When a traveler has exhausted the hydrogen from his container of hydride , he returns the spent metal powder for a new box and drives away , emitting only pure water-vapor from his hydrogen-powered vehicle , while the metal powder is returned to the plant for recharging.  | The cost of this whole operation is very low , since the chief ingredients  --  sea-water and electricity  --  are in bountiful supply ; and hydrogen power is used for every need . All the plumes of white smoke puffing from factories or locomotives are composed , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning , or oxidation , of hydrogen has water as its sole by-product . A traffic snarl in Ecologia-Bella smells like a sweet spring day , and flowers and shade trees grow lushly on the highway verges . Children playing in the cities ' streets absorb no carbon monoxide or lead , but only moisture which makes their hair curl and keeps down various viruses . Turning now to the darker side , Ecologia-Bella has of course an Integrated Armed Force , which wears white-and-gold uniforms with plumes on Sundays . On work-days they wear highly efficient camouflage , and practice maneuvers with their violently lethal equipment , which they have purchased with the silver and gold . Typically , they buy only a prototype or two of each item , which they promptly copy with improvements . Every soldier knows not only how to read the instructions on his gunship or whatever , but how to write them if necessary . As a fighting force they are formidable beyond all proportion to their numbers ; their individual strength is as the strength of ten because their heads are well-furnished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in Ecologia-Bella 's method of manufacturing some of their war machines and other mechanical devices . It is well known that many teen-age youths love nothing better than to take apart and reassemble some form of locomotion . Thus , at high-school age , instead of allowing this energy to go to waste in the restructuring of jeeps , vans , and motorcycles , all the boys and girls who wish to are introduced to the task of assembling , say , an attack plane or a tank , after classes . And great is the pride of the young artisans when their own bomber rolls out of the hangar and takes to the air . This does of course result in some rather odd names for deadly machinery , but the sight of " Wildflower Junior High " 98  | painted on his rocket-launcher serves to remind the operator what he is preparing to fight for . This same youthful interest is also harnessed in the fabrication of the I.A.F. 's computers and telecommunications equipment . And many are the youngsters ' innovations that are judged worthy of incorporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced upon EcologiaBella by the character of its neighboring nations , in particular the large state beyond its mountainous side , Pluvio-Acida . Pluvio-Acida 's landscape is said to be low and hilly , but no one has seen it for many generations because of the peculiar opacity of the air . It is also rumored to have once had topsoil and live trees , but the ground is now so eroded and churned up by people digging holes to mine whatever the previous hole-diggers did n't find , that , except for stretches of pavement cracked by subsidence , to step upon open ground is to fall into a kind of dry sludge scented with hydrogen sulphide . 11 The Pluvio-Acidans , like all sensible people , use fossil fuels , i.e. , petroleum , for energy , with the usual results . They have a rich but limited fauna consisting of brown rats , cockroaches , and two kinds of house-fly , and a species of crabgrass still grows wild . 11 The very rich , of which Pluvio-Acida has many , landscape their sludgy holdings with cleverly-made plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other class , the poor , or proletariat , of whom the nation has far more , look at the landscapes of the rich on state TV , which also tells them what to spend their wages on . Pluvio-Acida enjoys a very high rate of employment of able-bodied males between twenty and thirty-five ; the current figure is 105 percent . ( The extra percentage points were caused by some census takers ' failing to distinguish certain workers from robots . ) The unemployed cause no problem , since on the average day they can not be seen . All these workers toil like mad in smelters , machine-shops , mines , forges , rolling-mills , chemical plants , and so on , and the national product is extremely gross . 99  | The typical breakfast of a Pluvio-Acida worker consists of a sugar do-nut dunked in raw alcohol ; for lunch they omit the do-nut . The birthrate is high , but overpopulation is kept down by a series of unavoidable industrial accidents , called Oops , which are believed to be totally unrelated to the births of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spina bifida , or openskull . Pluvio-Acida has a heavy schedule of exports . Its smelters and forges , etc. , export melts , ingots , pig-iron , chunks , groockers , and slurp ; these are paid for in diamond tiaras , blood , and organs for transplant to those who can afford them . Its armed forces are strong , if unorthodox ; there is a small cadre of technicians who can operate the complex war-machines and a large mass of those who ca n't , who are issued Kalashnikovs . Their hearts not being very pure , their individual strength is not that of ten . But unfortunately there are eleven of them for every Ecologia-Bella soldier . Pluvio-Acida has a flourishing nuclear industry , despite its having occasioned a good many Oops . And in the most desolate corner of the least-enlightened province , mushroom-shaped clouds can occasionally be seen to arise . That is as far as it goes , however , for the Pluvio-Acidan Information Transmission Service , or P.I.T.S. , which is as ubiquitous as the house-flies , has reported some curious cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always under strict security and particularly when the jet-stream blows south . ( To the south is the land of Numbia , whose inhabitants have been through so much they do n't care whether they are radioactive or not . ) These clouds are studied by experts , and the dread word " fusion " is whispered about . So PluvioAcida 's Deep Strategic Thinkers are playing it safe . However , if P.I.T.S . had been a little more thorough , they might have found that the islet has been leased by a Mr. and Mrs. Fusion , makers of ceremonial fireworks , who are using it to work up their ever-more-splendid secret surprise programs for the royal festivities of Ecologia-Bella ; the island is safe from the  | prying eyes of their competitors , for the fireworks business is a cut-throat one . But it is now time for our story . We start with a handsome young crown prince in the nation of Pluvio-Acida , where royalty is determined by a simple count of wealth . And as he attains the age of eighteen , just next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful fifteen-year-old daughter is crowned queen . Amoretta , the little queen , is orphaned by a typical EcologiaBella accident . Her parents , having been married fourteen years and being very much in love , decide to go for a ride in the royal swan-boat . This boat  --  really a sort of sea-going double bed  --  is drawn by seventeen tame white swans , who put their necks in gold harnesses to obtain corn from a pan in front , and thus propel the royal barge . As the couple reach the far end of the lake they are fondly talking over the events of their life together , and wondering how fourteen years could have gone by , and assuring each other that they are totally unchanged  --  which they are . And presently , noting that they have reached the most private part of the lagoon , it comes to them to celebrate their anniversary and their love in the most natural way . Which they do . And then the swans , who have always wondered about people , get the idea too , and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some beavers on the bank , affected by the general outbreak of love , join in with even more rocking and tail-whacks . And somehow , in the midst of this riot of love , the boat is pushed , or pulled , over the low falls at the end of the lake , and overturned . And alas , when the royal couple go under , they are so warmly embraced that they neglect to swim . When Amoretta is told of the tragedy she is overcome with grief , for she loves her parents , as does all the population of Ecologia-Bella ; even her infant brother Truhart , who is as yet incommunicado , begins to weep . The grounds-keeper , in a fit of tearful revenge , determines  | that no such thing will ever occur again ; he carts all the cobs , or male swans  --  save one  --  to the veterinary 's . From whence they return honking soprano . The solitary intact cob he encloses in a golden pen so built that lady swans may go in , but he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cruel because swans mate for life ; but after a little observation she is compelled to admit that so long as the ladies are allowed regular visits to the golden pen , they seem perfectly happy with their soprano spouses . And they raise fine cygnets without the usual territorial strife . The deaths of Queen Rhapsodia and King Uxor come in due course to the ears of the rulers of Pluvio-Acida , who are of course the richest couple in that land . They have two sons . The eldest , Crown Prince Adolesco , is a throwback to some nobler stock  --  a handsome , blue-eyed , virile young man with a face as open as springtime , and  --  which is what panics his parents  --  a heart full of lofty ideals . He is often heard to utter the most unthinkable criticisms of the land he is to rule , and to intimate that there might come a time when changes would be made . The Pluvio-Acida Stock Exchange average falls fifteen points when Adolesco 's father catches a head-cold . The younger brother , Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squat and vaguely fungoid , with a face like a ferret and a mind to match . He stands in Pluvio-Acidan eyes for a fine young man , and much the better of the two . It is not , however , clear what should or could be done about this ; the elder brother seems to bear a charmed life , and none of the irresolute efforts at changing the succession have worked . His horse sees and jumps trip-wires ; he gives the cyanide-laced soup to a beggar ; and the hired sharp-shooter has an off week . As our story opens , we find the young crown prince in a traveling mood . Two points motivate him to travel to EcologiaBella . Firstly , he became aware of a steadily increasing traffic of eligible  --  or self-declared eligible  --  royal bachelors in that direc-  | tion . News of a beautiful virgin heiress to an attractive throne is getting about . Dowager queens escort their immature male offspring across Pluvio-Acida , heading for Ecologia-Bella . Doddering noblemen tighten their corset-stays and set out upon the matrimonial road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bold young king of a rich , if frozen northern country ; the handsome heir to a tropical paradise in the south ; and the suave , fatherly monarch of an eastern empire , who knows how to make his harem sound attractive to western ears . . . . Adolesco frowns , currying his best cross-country hack , a great snow-white gelding . What do these suitors have that he does n't ? How dare they come courting one who is his  --  his  --  own neighbor ? The second factor impelling him is parental . Our young prince has reached the age where the converse pressure is impinging on him . Holographs of stunning heiresses appear mysteriously upon his bureau . His parents give a grand party for the second and third richest couples , with their charming daughters . Scented letters , enclosing miniatures , float in from far-away courts . It begins to dawn on Adolesco that if he does n't take a hand in this , his parents will have somehow got him committed to he knows not whom . . . And is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said to be a darling vision , in her toy kingdom , has been produced ? He asks . And discovers that Ecologia-Bella not only is not taken seriously , it is positively disliked . 1 1 " That 's where our people get all those communist ideas , " his father growls . " Dreadfully ignorant people , " his mother adds . " Why , they do n't even understand capital gains . " She rolls up her protruding eyes , a daunting sight . Two weeks later , preceded by a courtly letter requesting to be received , young Adolesco sets off alone for Ecologia-Bella . ( His horse is shipped by oxygenated container to the mountain border . ) Here he books passage for himself and his horse on the Ecologia-Bella Overnight Express through the mountain passes 103  | and tunnels , not unobserved by the Ecologia-Bella Observation Service , and disembarks to ride down through the fantastic forests and other charms , where he meets many mild but pleasing adventures . He arrives at the palace on a beautiful and chilly spring evening , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sunset is casting a golden nimbus around horse and golden-haired rider  --  and seated at his pommel is the palace cook 's littlest daughter , whom he had found trudging home through the chill . At a grove of scarlet maples by the barge-landing his mount suddenly halts and stands stock-still ; there is a silver figure among the rosy maple blooms . It is a young girl , so absorbed in feeding the baby swans that she does n't hear his approach . He has a moment to observe her perfections  --  then she turns , startled , as the child calls her royal name . " Oh , " she cries , " I wanted to be alone ! So many people have come . He wheels to leave instanter , but in the business of setting the child down it seems he must dismount , and she has time to notice that he wears no spurs , unlike the Prince of Paradisio , and uses only a snaffle , not the cruel curb of the north . So presently , with the cygnets full-fed , two golden-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sunset intensifies its mellow splendor around them both . ... There really is no need for us to follow in detail the ensuing course of events . So let us briefly drop the curtain .. . When it rises again , a few months later , there are revealed two beautiful young persons who are deliriously , enchantedly , calamitously , in love . " He is different , " says the young queen to her advisors . " He really wants to change things , and make peace and do good . " " She is intoxicating , " the young prince writes to his best friend . " And the country is really a revelation . Why , if we were one nation , you could buy an estate here . " ( Ecologia-Bella prohibits the sale of land to other than third-generation  | nationals . ) The prince is so taken with Ecologia-Bella , which embodies many of his more impractical ideals , that his first thought is to save it intact as a sort of Disneyland annex to Pluvio-Acida , changing nothing except perhaps some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen 's advisors . These constitute the Council of Ecologia-Bella , a small , poorly-paid , selfinstituted group of older men and women , who come together now and then when some new factor or emergency threatens the stability of the country . It is clear that the present situation calls not only for watching , but perhaps for action . So a lady whom the queen likes very much points out to her , " If you wed Prince Adolesco , our nation will become a part of Pluvio-Acida and subject to its laws . They will start mining and clear-cutting and dredging and drilling for oil all over EcologiaBella . " " Oh , no , " replies Amoretta , dreamily but positively . " He swears he would change nothing . It will be mine to rule . " The lady looks at her and sees that there is no use discussing the changes that may take place in a man 's resolves between eighteen and thirty . " He will be your lawful king , " she only observes . " How will you like being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought of that . " Amoretta is braiding a flower into her yellow hair . " I would n't like it at all from King Boris or Prince Raoul . But my dear Adolesco is different . He truly loves me . I am sure he would never go against my wishes . " The lady sighs , and retires to report to the others that nothing can be done with sweet reason . The queen has been infected with a sweeter poison . At the same time , Adolesco is having his troubles with his own parents and advisors . But they are not so severe . The idea of peacefully annexing their old irritant , Ecologia-Bella , has charms . And as the king 's advisors point out , if this marriage is forbidden , only Mammon knows what wild idea the prince will have next . At least this may be expected to settle him down while  | keeping him near home  --  and occupy him with something other than tinkering with Pluvio-Acida 's economy . And some of the nobility look out at their plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estate in Ecologia-Bella . The advisors of the younger brother , Prince Slimoldi , draft up a cunning document which has the effect of giving Slimoldi certain powers over Pluvio-Acida  --  when Adolesco shall have inherited the kingdom  --  in the event that the new king devotes more than a certain percentage of time to the affairs of Ecologia-Bella . Such is the crown prince 's bedazzlement with love , and so dense is this prose , that he signs it without demur . Thus the way is clear for the grand **30;785;TOOLONG nuptials . Out on their rocky islet , the Fusions envision a rocketry display unparalleled in history . And the people of Ecologia-Bella , seeing only the handsome , young , idealistic crown prince , and the radiant joy of their young queen , rejoice in the match . But the Ecologia-Bella Council are not so easily contravened . A plainly-dressed older man , of whom the queen has always been just a little in awe , comes to see her , bearing a large volume in which the laws of Ecologia-Bella are inscribed on the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear , " he begins , after accepting a cup of scented wine , " it may have escaped your notice that there are certain legal aspects to the marriage of our sovereign  --  namely , you . " She looks up with a face that would melt a stone lion ; he hardens his heart . " Oh , I know about that , " she tells him . " The people must approve . Do you want me to call a referendum ? " " No need , no need . " He waves the referendum away . " I am satisfied that the people , particularly the younger ones , have taken your plans to their hearts . But there is another consideration , which must be invoked in view of your youth . " " What 's that ? Do you wish me to wait till I 'm old and wrinkled ? "  | " You may be only slightly wrinkled at , say , sixteen , " smiles the councilor . " Sixteen ? That 's a whole year away . " " Precisely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ruler is less than sixteen years of age , the council is empowered to defer his or her nuptials to that date , unless some emergency dictate otherwise . . . . There is no , ah , emergency , is there , my dear ? " " Emergency ? ? " " No , ah , royal heir in view ? " Little Queen Amoretta draws herself up to her full five-feetthree . " The Queen of Ecologia-Bella is not an animal ! " " Splendid , " the councilor approves . But to himself he wonders ; a royal bastard would of course create difficulties , but if that could be avoided , his experiences have indicated that there is nothing like a spell of unchecked intimacy to cool love 's first ardors . He clears his throat . " There is another point in our laws , my child . I 'm sorry to have to tell you this . But our ancestors , who devised the code that has served us so well , were familiar with the course of love . They laid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would imperil the independence of Ecologia-Bella , the assent of the full council is required before it can take place . Moreover , the determination that the independence of Ecologia-Bella is in jeopardy is to be made , not by the monarch , or by popular vote , but by the full council itself . " And it is my sad duty to tell you that the council has determined that this match of yours would indeed imperil the independence of your nation , and our recommendation is that it not take place . " " You mean that you can  --  you will  --  forbid my marrying Adolesco ? Forbid me the joy of my life ? " Her eyes blazing , the little queen actually stamps . " Never ! Who passed this law ? I 'll change it ! " " Not so fast , my dear . " The old councilor remains seated , 107  | waving his hand soothingly . " Not so fast . I have not said we will forbid it . But you must accept the idea that we can . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amoretta is pacing . " I know ! " she flings out . " I 'll abdicate ! That 's it , I 'll just abdicate . Then you ca n't forbid me doing anything ! " " Ah , my dear , assuming that the prince would still find himself able to wed a commoner ? " " He would ! I 'm sure of it , " she declares , and then adds , for she is an honest girl , " I 'm pretty sure . " Her face is a trifle thoughtful . " Yes . Assuming that , my dear , would the people of EcologiaBella let you ? And we could n't let you do anything which would cause such convulsions . Think . They have just lost your beloved parents . Your brother is but an infant . Will you now desert them  --  and for purely selfish ends ? " " Well . . . N-no . " " Spoken like a queen . " " Oh ! " Amoretta collapses into her chair , suddenly more child than queen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ... I 'd rather die ! " " Do you mean that ? Come , think . " She does think for a moment . Then , " Yes , " she says slowly , surprising him a little . " I think I would rather die than never marry my love . There 'd be nothing to live for , then . . . Are you empowered ' to kill your queen ? " she asks bitterly . He does n't take the bait , but merely says gently , " Very well , my dear . But first let us see what time can do . You will agree to set your nuptials for one year hence , when you will be sixteen ? " " On my birthday , " she says firmly . " If I must . " ... That next year passes in a whirl of pleasures  --  all pleasures save one , that is , for the little queen is serious . Adolesco , who has other resources , submits . But to the council 's dismayed eyes , the passage of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion . Now and again the elderly councilor drops by to inquire formally .  | " You still feel that you could not endure a life without young Adolesco , my dear ? " " I still do , " she replies ; and sometimes she smiles . However , the year does accomplish something . Various council members find occasion to consult with their queen on diverse problems , economic and social , of EcologiaBella ; they are small , soluble problems , to be sure , but enlightening to Amoretta , who had always assumed that her state somehow ran itself . Now she perceives that there is a subtle ongoing process whereby a quiet push here , a tug-back there , a plan within a plan , are required to keep her nation on course . She is impressed by the length of foresight employed , the keen eye for socio-demographic changes , the seriousness with which any unusual manifestation  --  for instance , an outbreak of minimalist art among the weavers of a province  --  is viewed . And , most enlightening of all , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to Pluvio-Acida . " Your brother is very . . . different from you , " she says lovingly to Adolesco . " Slimie 's a nerd . " " I think he is worse than that . He is cruel . I see it in his eyes . " Then she sees something new in the eyes of her young lover  --  a flash of anger , gone as soon as perceived , but unmistakably there . It 's all right for him to call his brother a nerd , but it 's something else to have his family criticized by outsiders . Amoretta says no more , but soothes the kitten-scratch with a kiss . " I love you so ! " " And I you Oh Godlet 's run away " . ? . " Queens do not run away  --  nor kings , " she adds hastily . " Besides , it 's only a month now , my darling . Thirty little days ! " " Thirty eternities . " His eyes devour her . ... And so at last the great day dawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born on Midsummer 's Eve . The explosions , heard faintly through the mountain passes , 108  | are caused by the Pluvio-Acida border guards on the far side , attempting to halt the hordes of their fellow citizens who have been encamped nearby , waiting for the moment when PluvioAcida and Ecologia-Bella would become one . In the vanguard is a cortege of Pluvio-Acidan nobility , checkbooks clasped , determined to have first choice of Ecologia-Bellan real estate . The sunrise detonations are also augmented by the popping of an air gun in the palace park ( air guns being the only ballistic weapon allowed out of Armed Force hands ) . Prince Adolesco , dressed for the chase , is popping away at a congregation of fat stags and several plump pheasants , who are crowding about him in expectation of treats . The air-gun pellets , being of local manufacture , annoy them only slightly . " Damn and bedevil them ! " the prince cries out in anger to the sky , and follows this with far stronger imprecations at a particularly obese deer who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hastily modulates down again as Amoretta and a group of special friends come in sight , taking a farewell sunrise stroll . The prince had hoped to work off far stronger tensions by stronger means . The queen runs to him . " What 's wrong , my darling ? Are you hurt ? " " Why in  --  why wo n't they run ? Move , you godlost bird ! Fly away ! These animals , they 're hopeless cowards , Amy , that 's what they are ! Why wo n't they run ? " " Never mind , darling Adol  --  we 'll train one to run ! Fast as lightning ! " The prince utters a groan of complex frustration and flings the air gun far . Recovering himself , he salutes the company , kisses his beloved 's hand and stalks away . Amoretta gazes after him , smiling fondly . A senior lady among her friends observes that smile , and feels her heart chill , for it seals Amoretta 's fate . It is not the mere open radiance of an infatuated girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year past has developed  --  the undauntable spark of the maternal drive . Amoretta knows her lover now ; she is aware of so much that 110  | many think her heedless . But instead of dimming her passion , this has done just the opposite . Adolesco has become in part her son , of whom all is forgiven . She sees his faults and counts them as nothing , with a mother 's unshakable conviction that he will outgrow them under her care . The lady sighs at the dilemma : this misdirection of the flooding drive to mother things might have been aborted had Amoretta had a real babe to coddle ; but it is too late now . Yes , alas ; we see that even in Ecologia-Bella a girl may take to her too-motherly heart some scapegrace , who will usurp the place of her later , rightful children . Not that Adolesco is a scapegrace ; he is only very young and formless , and the shape into which he will later crystallize may not be so attractive . But we must return to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial brunch , attended by Prince Adolesco 's parents , the rulers of Pluvio-Acida . They arrive in the morning in their royal jet-liner , which is of course conventionally fueled . A respectable crowd is assembled to view the arrival of King Puerco Volante , Queen Porcellana , and Prince Slimoldi , although there is a good deal of discreet sneezing and holding of noses . Queen Porcellana reciprocates . " What is this terrible smell ? " she demands of Adolesco , who has bounded up the ramp to meet them . " It 's like poison gas . My God ! Do you suppose ? ? " " Cool it , mother dear . It 's only fresh air . Affects some people like that at first . " The queen sniffs . " No wonder I see people wearing nosemasks . It 's those dreadful trees . The first thing you must do is have them all cut down . I 've been told they cause pollution . " And by the time King Puerco Volante and his family reach the palace where little Queen Amoretta is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they say nothing worth relating . Their participation at the brunch is cut short by Queen Porcellana 's feeling faint , and they gratefully retire to the royal guest suite . 111  | Shortly the rest of the party retires too , to rest and prepare for the festivities ahead . The wedding is scheduled for the early evening , that having been the hour of Amoretta 's birth , but the summer sun is still high . And now the elder councilor pays his last visits . He finds the little queen en deshabille , dreamily perfecting a bridesmaid 's wreath of flowers . " My dear , " he says with great solemnity , " are you ready for the hour when your wishes  --  all of them  --  come true ? " She starts to reply gaily , then checks ; this is no ordinary conversation . " Yes . . . I mean , yes . " " Then you will come with me . That hour is very near . " He unfolds a great gauzy veiling cloak he has carried on his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her mirror and brush and begins to work feverishly . " Oh , but my  --  and my nose  --  wait ! " " No need for that . It will all be attended to . " He nods toward an elder lady and the ladies ' maid , who have silently entered behind him and started to select things from her closets and dressing-table , and place them in a great plain bag . " You will meet all these again shortly . Now put this on  --  that 's right , it must cover your face  --  and come with me . Speak to no one . We must hope that you pass unrecognized . " She follows him out and through the back ways of the palace , which she knows well , but where so many strangers have been coming and going on unexplained errands that one more is scarcely remarked . In a small courtyard is a long , low , inconspicuous auto with a driver in mufti , into which he hands her . When they are settled and moving , he clears his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must learn that there is a certain hour , loosely speaking , which is out of history and is not timed on Ecologia-Bella 's clocks . I put this metaphorically , to convey that actions taken or deeds done during this hour do not count . They have no official existence . And that hour is the time just before a royal ceremony of marriage , where we are now . "  | " But what ? ! " she asks , for during the past weeks she has become ever more puzzled . She has been told that she can not , she will not marry Adolesco , yet every sign seems to say that she will . She has not been so foolish as to hope  --  and yet she has , a little . But what she has been vaguely expecting is something more official , or even catastrophic , not this strange speech . " I know  --  I 'm being kidnapped ! " The councilor holds up his hand . " No . Permit me to continue . The reason for the existence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the parades , speeches , hours of formalities and convivialities , and the other turmoil of a long wedding day are not conducive to the happiest outcome , that night , for the newly wedded pair . Both will be exhausted , keyed up , over-fed , over-speechified , and who knows what , when they are finally left alone in a glare of public attention . Do you follow me ? " " Oh , yes ! In fact ? " His hand goes up again . " So it has been arranged for them to be alone , whilst they are fresh , in an hour which does not exist , in a place which is in no guide-book , to do whatever their hearts desire , in total privacy , as befits one of the most tender moments of their lives . Where I am taking you , the queenly and maidenly scruples which you have upheld so well may be relaxed , for this is an old tradition . All details have long been worked out . You have nothing to fret about , nothing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place you before the altar in plenty of time . The populace will have had their ceremonial parades and viewings , and all things proper done , as they were when your maiden mother took this path before you . Do you still follow me ? " " Oh , yes ! Oh , yes indeed ! How wonderful ! But ? " " But in your case , my dear , " he goes on firmly , " there is a difference . I have said that all your wishes will come true . You have seen how you will have your heart 's desire , your Adolesco , at the best hour of his life . But you have also wished to die if you 113  | can not marry him . That , my dear , is still true . You may not and will not . And therefore this will be not only the happiest hour of your life , but the last . " When the time arrives you will be given two vials to drink , one bitter and one sweet . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed totally happy , without any of the little physical tensions and drawbacks that often minimize a maiden 's first experience of physical love . That is the bitter cup . The sweet one will ensure that after your total mortal fulfillment , a slight and painless chill will come over your body . That will be all you feel before you faint away . But that faint is fatal ; you , Queen Amoretta , will never awaken . To put it bluntly , after your love-tryst you will die . Are you still prepared ? " " Yes . " The little queen lifts her chin , her sweet lips set . " Good . Then there is one small thing you must do . Your prince , having seen you die in his arms , would naturally be inconsolable , distraught , and quite unready for certain things he must do . Therefore , at some point during the , ah , proceedings , you must tell him  --  and convince him ! ? that you are your own double . That the queen found herself unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead  --  as indeed , is both parties ' right . You can see the need for this , and your ingenuity will know how to do it , I think ? " " Oh , yes  --  but will he never know ? Will he marry someone else ? Oh , that  --  no , no ! " " Calm yourself . The deception is just for an hour . And he will marry nobody  --  unless it be many years hence , back in Pluvio-Acida . And he will very soon know that the tale of a double is poppycock ; that he spent this hour with the Queen herself . " " Very well . Is that all ? Now I must think . . . Why , are we going to the cathedral ? " The wedding is to take place before the grand altar of the Goddess of Restrained Fertility , one of the great architectural ornaments of the capital . " Yes , but to a part of it that few know of . "  | " I suppose my body will lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , for a day . In the Cathedral of the All . " " Then will you see , please , that Donna does my hair ? " " Certainly . " The elder pulls out his jot-pad and carefully notes this . There was silence for a block or two . " My poor people , " the queen muses at length . " I do think they liked me , do n't you ? And I tried to do little things . . . but I was so young . " " More than liked . They will have to get to know the sterling qualities of your brother before their grief abates . . . . And now it is my official injunction to you to think only of the joy immediately ahead . Think how you will soon feel when your prince appears with open arms and you are free to respond . " " Ohhh . Yes . " And she thinks of nothing else , until they draw up at the rear of the cathedral , beside an inconspicuous old service door . Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the maid , with the bag . " This is Lady Verdant , my dear . I believe you know her . She will take care of everything , and be within sound of your call at every moment . " With that , the councilor departs . A suitable time later he knocks at the prince 's door . " Oh , come in . " He enters to find the prince drying off from his seventh shower of the day in a pair of shorts emblazoned with the arms of Pluvio-Acida . He is fretfully trying to sharpen the ceremonial sword which his parents brought him , along with the other necessary accoutrements of the wedding . He is also glancing frequently at an ormolu clock which he suspects of having stopped , so slowly does the afternoon pass for him . " This thing will not take an edge , " he exclaims . " Absolute tinware . That 's another thing I love about Ecologia-Bella  --  all your stuff is such fine quality . I wish I knew what you do to your work-force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the councilor smiles . " And 115  | now , my dear young Prince , you are about to participate in an old Ecologia-Bella custom which I fancy will please you more than anything on earth . " " Oh , god , do I have to get dressed ? " " Absolutely not . " The councilor shakes out another great gauzy robe . " Oh , perhaps you might take a nice-looking dressing gown  --  that gold one over there will do . " He motions to the valet who is entering behind him . " And a pair of slippers . Old stones are cold . " " And that 's not the only thing that is , " mutters the prince , but his curiosity is roused , particularly when the valet selects a bottle of scent and a brush among the items he is putting in a bag . " I think your complaints in that quarter will soon cease , " beams the councilor , helping him into the all-disguising cloak . " Now just come with me and try to look unnoticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the auto , and the councilor 's explanation , omitting that part specific to Queen Amoretta . The prince 's response is everything the councilor could wish . " What a wonderful country ! " Adolesco exclaims over and over , nervously crossing his legs . " What an enlightened land ! ? You really mean this ? She 'll be there ? It 's not some joke ? " " On my honor . Why , look ? " he picks up a flower Amoretta had caught in her veiling . " She has just made this trip before you . " " Oh my god ! What a country ! " The prince clutches the blossom as if it were the keys to Heaven , and recrosses his legs . From the sunny afternoon in the parking area , they enter the inconspicuous door of the cathedral , and find themselves in a cool , dim , ancient corridor . On its left wall are tall marble abutments , which form the rear of the massive pedestal of the Goddess ' great seated statue . In a recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal a polished walnut door under a softly glowing lamp . The councilor motions Adolesco to stop . " Inside that door is an apartment , furnished with all things desirable to lovers . There are several rooms ; your valet will be in  | a back chamber , ready to dress you later for the official ceremony , for which you will be called in ample time . " In the first room you come to is a bed . And in the bed will be a young , virgin queen , who has never seen the nude body of a living man . Nor has hers been seen by male eyes , nor touched by a male hand  --  not even a doctor 's since her birth . And , mark well , she is also a queen , of a long line of sovereign blood . Your behavior will require your utmost sensitivity . I know you have it ; I have closely watched your talent for avoiding anger or alarm in a blooded horse . This is not to imply that the queen is an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same sensitivity runs through all , does it not ? " I leave you now . Compose yourself , and knock . If there be no answer  --  no answer  --  enter . But if the answer be No , ' you must on no account dare to enter ; call me and I will get you hence . But I doubt this mischance will occur . Now goodbye . May you have all the happiness your love deserves . " The councilor takes the disguising cloak and leaves him . Adolesco inhales deeply , and approaches the charmed door . When he knocks , it sounds to him like gunfire , though his hand had been as gentle as he could make it . Involuntarily he holds his breath , listening . No sound , certainly no voice , comes from behind the door . His throat full of panic , he turns the latch and opens it . The room that meets his gaze is a blur of soft light and color . He looks blindly round once till his gaze is stopped at a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can clearly trace as a young girl 's small body , and over the held-up top edge , under a mass of gold hair , are the two largest eyes he has ever seen in his life , seeking his . Their eyes lock together . Tentatively he takes a step forward ... then another ... " Amy ? ? " ? But it is needless to follow in detail the drama that has played as long as the human race , though seldom at such intensity . 117  | Enough to report that all goes well , very well  --  even the storm toward the end , when Amoretta confesses to being her own double . " It all happened at the last minute  --  the poor little queen was so torn up between her idea of propriety and her love for you that she got sick  --  I mean , really sick . And she knew she could n't go through with it right , she would n't be any good for you . But she could n't bear the idea of calling out No ' and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  in fact , maybe I suggested it . I 'm not so strict on this virginity business as she is  --  I mean , I 'm a virgin  --  I mean , I was ? " She laughs enchantingly , so like a jollier Amoretta that his heart twinges . ( In fact , Amoretta , little mischief , is thoroughly enjoying her role . ) " But I kept on just for her , see , because we should be alike . I 've always taken my job very seriously , I study her . You 'd be surprised at some of the things I 've done ! Big long ceremonials of course  --  and some close work , too . Nobody 's ever suspected . I went with her to your country in fact  --  did you ever suspect when I was with you on the stand reviewing the Pluvio-Acida Army , Navy , Air Force , and what-all ? " " That was you ? " The storm has long since melted away . " It certainly was . She knew it would take forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does . My , you have a huge Armed Force . And oh , my , you were so handsome ! " " And you were very beautiful . . . But do you mean you 've been around the palace ? Why have n't I met you ? " " Oh , you have . It was a tremendous thrill for me . But you never gave me another glance , no one does . I have different hair and eyes and all , and a piece of pink tape on my jaw that changes my whole face . Oh , and a bit of padding here and there . I call it my Uniform ' B. ' When I 'm being her it 's Uniform A. ' " His eyes go over her , caressingly , astounded . " But you 're so alike . . . it 's unbelievable. ? Look here , how do I know you two wo n't play more tricks on me ? "  | " Oh , we could n't . Not now . But I 'll tell you a secret  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her peachbloom bottom . " See that great brown spot on my left , uh ? " Suddenly remembering who he is and what 's been happening , she blushes rosy all over the peaches and makes to hide . He holds her firmly , laughing and peering . " You mean this teeny little beauty-spot I can barely see ? " " Well , yes . But the queen is perfect , see . That 's my mark . So you can always tell . " " That might present a problem at an official function . " And between giggles and struggling they are soon entwined in the classic reconciliation . The whole thing now seems to the prince rather more titillating than disappointing . What excessively healthy young man can be truly insulted by having a beautiful extra virgin to initiate on his wedding day ? Nothing is amiss that a splendid Ecologia-Bella seafood salad wo n't cure , and that has thoughtfully been provided . So he is asleep , and she nearly so , when she feels the final , fatal chill gently taking her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too faint to wake him . Not until the councilor is standing over him with the dressing-gown does Adolesco come groggily to his feet  --  and he might have been hustled away without knowing anything is amiss did he not stoop to kiss her farewell . Then the coolness of her flesh and the stillness of her body strikes him to full , frightened wakefulness . " Oh my god  --  what  --  Help ! " " Help is here . We have always been afraid of this , " the councilor tells him , pulling him back so that two white-coated strangers may get at her . " She has a heart condition . But these are our best cardiologists , they will do everything possible . Now you have other matters to concern you . Come , leave this charming lady to her doctors  --  you have a queen to marry ! " So the prince reluctantly finds himself in another chamber , being bathed and dressed in his most beautiful crimson uniform , 119  | and when he would have returned to the bedroom he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows him splendid in scarlet and gold lightens his mood , and since , after all , he can do nothing , and this is a different story , he turns his rising spirits to his duties immediately ahead . He is , it seems , a trifle late . " You must hurry now , " says the councilor , guiding him to a winding passageway . " Just follow this , quickly  --  there will be people at the end to tell you what to do . " And now our single tale becomes complex , for it takes place in three arenas at once . Let us look first at what has been happening outside the cathedral : The wedding parade from the palace is splendid beyond compare . Leading off is the first band , and never has music been gayer or more stimulating , never have uniforms glittered and instruments gleamed so brightly in a summer 's sinking sun . Behind their marching band comes a phalanx of the people of Ecologia-Bella , all in their national dress , which runs heavily to snowy ruffles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . These are the winners of the contests which have been held all year  --  contests of tree-felling , tapestrybroidering , chess-matches , gymnastics , welding , flower-growing , chimney-sweeping , computer-building , and **29;817;TOOLONG winners , all prancing gaily along tossing flowers , together with some that have won no contests at all , but are merely beloved . And then comes a splendid float , signifying everything noble and free and delightful , in a wondrous confection of so many flowers that their perfume pervades the whole air . After it begins the long line of carriages , all beflagged , each drawn by matched teams of different breeds of horses , shining sorrel and ivory and ebony and spotted and red . The first carriages convey parties of visiting notables , and elder folk  --  and never have horses strode so stirringly , never have harness and head-plumes so sparkled and tossed . At this point comes a steam-calliope drawn by ponies , to keep up the beat , and right  | behind is the royal marching band from Pluvio-Acida , braying out their country 's anthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reason of the steam-calliope . Following their band come two coaches of the royal family of Pluvio-Acida , nervously clutching the handholds of this unfamiliar vehicle , between perfunctory waves at the crowds . And then comes  --  Ahh ! ? the first of the bridal party 's carriages , in scarlet and gold , carrying the young nobles who will serve as Prince Adolesco 's ushers . And behind them , in pastel colors , come three open victorias like huge floral bouquets of Queen Amoretta 's bridesmaids and special friends . And finally , finally , passes a great white-and-gold landau like a wedding-cake , in which , totally veiled in gossamer and flowers , sits the queen . ( Or so it is believed , for Amoretta really does have a double . ) She is accompanied only by her senior maid of honor and a beribboned nurse holding an equally beribboned Prince Truhart , and she waves warmly , but not frivolously , to the adoring crowd , since this is a solemn day . And behind her comes the cause of it all , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curvets and prances like Bucephalus . The Prince 's handsomeness is sensed rather than seen , because the plumes of his dress-uniform casque are so gorgeous that only glimpses of his face can be seen . But his heroic figure and horsemanship are ample proofs of royalty . Behind him comes a mounted contingent of the Palace Guard in gold and white and more plumes , their magnificent horses keeping step . After them follows a final band , whose tootling and booming pace the horses . The last element is a large troop of the prize-winning animals raised this year , with their proud and largely juvenile owners , all led by a great black bull . And the whole is followed by a melodious rabble of streetsingers , jugglers , and stilt dancers ; while the end is brought up by a highly functional squad of debris-collecting trucks in whiteand-gold . And from start to finish of the line of march , at the sides of the way are people releasing ( and handing out ) balloons , and white  | doves who have been trained to circle becomingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floral streamers and whistle-pipes and confetti  --  and also a sprinkling of dressuniformed police men and women , whose main task is to retrieve mislaid children who have temporarily joined one of the bands . And inasmuch as the prince is from where he unfortunately is , the crowd contains more than a sprinkling of emphatically non-uniformed palace guards , who happily have no cause that day to display their special talents . The parade ends in front of the cathedral , where there is a fine grassy square onto which the popular elements of the parade disperse and find their places in a reasonably orderly way , while the carriage passengers draw up to disembark on the cathedral 's main steps to enter the huge nave , which is already well filled . The bridal party proper disappears around the corner to debouch at the official side door , which opens into a large corridor of antechambers and retiring rooms , where a procession may prepare and form up . And here we leave them for a moment . In the main hall , the organ , a famous beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it voices several grand chords , and all fall still . Into the silence rises the music of a single flute from overhead  --  a delicately enchanting yet solemn solo , symbolizing the tenderness and depth of the impending event . The flautist is world-class ; even the Pluvio-Acidan contingent cease rustling and complaining to listen . Following this , according to Ecologia-Bella custom , a veiled priestess of the Goddess of Restrained Fertility advances to the flower-flanked altar , and beautifully chants a prayer for all the appropriate blessings , and in only their appropriate number . As she completes her chant , the archbishop of all Ecologia-Bella advances to her place before the altar . But at that moment the priestess notices that a certain small green light amid the flowers has not come on , signifying a delay . With long experience in ceremonial matters , she adds a prepared  | coda to the prayer proper , plus a moment of silent meditation , and the light is on . She turns and is walking away  --  when there occurs an extraordinary event for whose inception we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them entering the corridor of antechambers which are at the side separated from the nave by a heavy baize double door . The various parties vanish into their respective retiring-rooms to effect those inevitable small repairs and recuperations required after a long , tiring ride . The royalty of Pluvio-Acida are offered light refreshments , which the Puerco Volantes have never been known to refuse , and restoratives are presented in the chambers of the gentlemen ushers and the bridesmaids and friends of the queen . But the figures of Queen Amoretta and Prince Adolesco quickly disappear into separate royal apartments where they may be alone . These are set in this side of the pedestal of the great goddess-statue , where , unknown to most , they communicate privately to the even more private apartment on the far side , which we have already met . Thus , when the young lady who has ridden in the queen 's carriage enters the queen 's retiring-room , she is quickly relieved of the royal crown and robe and veiling , and turned loose to mingle and enjoy herself among the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret door is opened , and a small , cold figure is carried in . Lady Verdant alone remains , to attire the recently so-vividly alive little body in the irony of her wedding clothes . Next door , a happier exchange is being made . The temporary prince enters , gratefully relieving himself of the overly plumose casque and Adolesco 's sword and other accoutrements . He is in fact a handsome blond groom from the royal stables , who has thoroughly enjoyed himself  --  save for the feathers  --  on the prince 's splendid white horse . As he reverts to groomhood , there enters in haste Adolesco himself from the secret corridor , who still has barely presence of mind to thank his impersonator , and they might have got into a 123  | discussion of the gelding 's off rear pastern problem , but for an elderly man  --  whom neither the prince nor many others have ever seen before , or since  --  who hurriedly enters and grasps the prince 's arm . " Quick ! You are late ! Your queen stands alone before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown functionary hustles the prince into the main corridor , which to his eyes looks ominously deserted , and they rush to the great baize doors . The prince 's escort takes a peek out . " Hurry ! She is becoming impatient ! Oh , Heaven  --  she is turning away . This is no time for explanations , young man ? Are you strong enough to carry her ? " " Yes ! But ? " " Then dash out there , pick her up and carry her back to the altar and marry her , " the elder exhorts him . " Go ! " And such is the profound disorientation of the young prince , after a day fraught with emotional events , in which he has obeyed strange commands with even stranger outcomes  --  that he dashes forthwith out the baize doors into the cathedral aisle , where a veiled girl is walking away  --  picks her up bodily and carries her back to the altar , where the archbishop , being a trifle near-sighted , automatically begins to intone the wedding service . And any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead , who burst incontinently into song . The congregation is frozen dumb with shock . But at the first moment of relative quiet from the choir , the priestess throws off her veil and cries , " Release me this instant , you imbecile ! I am not your queen ! " And indeed , all see that she could not be , for she is as beautiful as Sheba , and as black . This moment of cosmic embarrassment is ended by the arrival of a posse headed by the council and Prince Slimoldi , who between them manage to get Adolesco back behind the baize doors , having urged the audience to remain calm . The antechamber events which then begin to ensue can be  | imagined , for the discovery of the queen 's body is imminent , but we must pause a moment to inquire how this bit of what can only be called buffoonery comes about on tragedy 's eve . First , the identity of the elder who gave Adolesco the idiotic commands is never satisfactorily resolved , and he has disappeared . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Slimoldi 's advisors . Others take the view that he was simply an over-age cathedral retainer whose wits had been overcome by excitement so that he misinterpreted matters . The populace in general tend to believe that Adolesco was temporarily deranged by the news of his queen 's death , and , ignorant of the country 's customs , saw what he thought was his lost love waiting . Whatever the explanation , the episode effectively quenched the gathering glow of the young prince 's charisma in EcologiaBella . To have reacted to the death of his beloved by rushing out and attempting to wed the priestess , simply could n't be seen in any very favorable light . The Ecologia-Bellans relate it with guffaws and giggles between their sighs . But is this not an outcome which the more foresighted members of the council may have wished ? Is there not an element of danger to a small country whose people begin to sentimentalize the ruler of a neighboring , hostile state ? And , finally , is not the removal of latent dangers the council 's business ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cui Bono ? that the council itself may not have been so very surprised by the prince 's actions ; it simply went off better than their hopes . Even the kindest of Ecologia-Bellans agree that a youth who could behave so is n't ideally suited to be their king . But we must return now to the antechambers of the cathedral , where word is starting to run that something dreadful has happened to the queen . As the members of the procession emerge to form in line , a white-coated man stations himself beside the queen 's door , and from outside come the unmistakable sounds of an ambulance arriving . 125  | " The queen is gravely ill . The wedding is . . . postponed . " " Vehicles are coming to convey you back to the palace , or wherever you may wish to go , " the councilor tells them . Attendants materialize , ready to help . But the prince pushes his way into the chamber where his queen 's body lies . One look at the idle equipment dismays him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctors with Lady Verdant . " Revive her , damn you ! Let me by  --  I will ! " He is restrained , but not before his fingers have brushed the stony coldness that convinces more than words . He stares down , heart-stricken . But one wild hope remains . There has been too much confusion today . " Leave me alone with her for five minutes ! I demand it as my right . " " Very well , Your Majesty , " replies the Lady Verdant , motioning the others from the room . But as she turns to follow , she says to him quietly and sadly , " Do not concern yourself with moles , or beauty-spots or such , my poor young prince . I removed the one you saw , as I put it on . You see , the queen conceived her tale of a double to protect a little of her modesty . It was the queen herself you were with . " He looks at her in silence , his last hope gone . He has , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than now .... Let us leave him to the few moments ' privacy allowed to royalty and grief . When they are over , the councilor comes in . He has a proposal . " I wo n't intrude on you with my condolences . Death has touched me too . But there remain practical matters . I imagine you would prefer to spend some time now in your homeland ? you will appreciate that at the moment your , ah , image here is rather mixed . "  | When the Prince frowns at him uncomprehendingly , the old man adds , " Ms. Victoria Ntutu . " " Who ? " " The priestess you , ah , partially wedded . " " Ohhh . " He clasps his hand to his forehead . " What shall I do ? I do n't want the family ? " " Listen . The Ecologia-Bella International Overnight Express will be departing shortly . I remembered that you enjoyed your trip in her , and I have taken the liberty of having the royal coach attached to the first section . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Your things will meet you there . By tomorrow noon you will be at your capital , having had a long night and morning of peace and calm . What do you say ? " The prince 's assent is never in doubt . So that is where young Prince Adolesco spends his wedding night , and it is as soothing and pleasant as  --  under the circumstances  --  can be . And curiously , this is his last night as prince . By a chance which not even the Ecologia-Bella Council could have improved on , his mother , Queen Porcellana , is now actually quite ill from an excess of oxygen combined with the deprivation of certain food additives one can become quite dependent on . She demands to leave this dreadful place at once . So King Puerco Volante orders up the royal jet , undeterred by the fact that the weather has broken at the queen 's death , and storms are in the mountains . Moreover , the pilot has been celebrating a little prematurely . When the mountain passes turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains the sense to rise high above the ranges . But when a massive cloud-to-cloud lightning bolt strikes the plane and takes out the electrical systems , he can not recall in time which of the six hundred and eighty-five switches will solve matters  --  and orders the party to bail out . And alas , it is discovered too late that the last surviving family of porcupines in Pluvio-Acida , escapees from the local zoo , have 127  | been nesting in the royal parachutes . The multiply-punctured silk ruptures above two thousand meters . And poor King Puerco Volante belies his name : he can in no way volar , nor can Queen Porcellana or Prince Slimoldi . So Adolesco arrives refreshed in his capital to find himself the King of Pluvio-Acida , and for the next years has a great deal to do . Thus when a youngster grasps at too much , and is told to " Remember the crown prince 's wedding , " he may reply , " Yes  --  but he ended up king ! " To which may be given such answer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which no man alive today in Ecologia-Bella may know : A few days after the tragic death of Queen Amoretta , in an ancient , rambling , stone-and-mortar nunnery high up in the wooded mountains , a brown-haired girl opens her brown eyes and speaks for the first time , slow and soft . " Am . . . I . . . alive ? " The old man who is bending over her says , " You are . Queen Amoretta is not . " " How . . . sad . " " Yes and no . Would you take something to drink ? You 've been unconscious for several days . " " Yes . . . . An accident ? " She is more alert . " No . A rare new hypothermic drug we are testing for certain conditions . Including difficult rescues . " " Oh . . . " She smiles , and soon has soup to occupy her . And we can fill in the tale from here on . Sister Inconnue , as she is called until she shall choose her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been studying . They have started her on the knowledge of all the flora and fauna of Ecologia-Bella . The nuns are a teaching order , and its best pupils finish at universities all over the world , before returning to enrich their country .  | " It all seems like a dream , " she says to the councilor on one of his periodic visits . " Very sad and rather silly . But why ? " she asks earnestly . " Please tell me , just why ? Could n't you have done it , well , differently ? " " No way , " says the Lady Verdant , and bites her embroiderythread . " You see , my dear , " the councilor explains , " after very earnest thought by the full council , we came to two conclusions . The first was that a small country as vulnerable as ours simply can not afford a beautiful young virgin queen . You saw what was already arriving at the palace ; there would have been no end to it . Jealousies , conflicts , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's freedom would have been imperiled . That is n't true for your brother , he ca n't bring home a ruler . The international succession laws are archaic , of course ; a crime . But we ca n't change that . " One other  --  and equally important  --  discovery was that somewhere under those golden curls was a brain , which it would have been a sin to destroy , and a shame to waste upon the symbolic activities of queenship . This way , if you study hard , you can make yourself perhaps into a councilor of Ecologia-Bella , and that , as you may have noticed ? " " Is the real power in what I thought was my land , " she says mischievously . " Exactly . A dangerous system , but the best we have found . " " I see . . . " She looks away reflectively . " I wonder . Maybe , when I am old and very wise . . . would it surprise you if I proposed another ? "  | Of course they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But which hospital ? Not a big base hospital , but not a front-line station either  --  Congressional Armed Service Committee members are too precious to go where real iron is flying . Not to mention the value of the half-dozen generals escorting the fact-finding tour of the Bodeguan front . A perfect hospital is found . The town of San Izquierda , just inside the Bodeguan border , has finally been liberated by American troops after the Libras had nibbled at it several times , and each time been run out by the Guevaristas . After the sixth loss the GIs were sent in to take it conclusively  --  what was left of it . Now the front has rolled forward twenty-five or fifty kilometers  --  depending on whose maps you used  --  and a big mansion formerly owned by one of the dictator 's pals has been converted into an Intermediate Rehab Unit . The patients are a mix of GIs who would go back on duty , with some whose condition was bad enough to invalid them back to base , or even home . 130  | So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make time . This is the last event of the senators ' day , and they 've been delayed at Hona Base . There was an obstacle course demonstration by US field instructors , and a parade of Libra troops in training , and speeches . That caused the trouble ; even General Sternhagen had been moved to say more than a few words . Senator Biller , the ranking committee member , sits in the rear of the stretch Mercedes with two American flags on the fenders . Behind him come two new ' 98 Caddies with the rest of the committee and some more generals , similarly beflagged . All the other escort vehicles bear twin flags , one American , the other the official Libra flag , which had been somewhat hastily designed and is not everywhere recognized with confidence . The senator sits between General Schehl and the interpreter . She is a neat and sultry-looking young lady , whose grasp of such fundamental phrases as " founding fathers " is , Senator Biller feels , a trifle shaky . He is wishing he could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States  --  history . He is also musing on the Libra troops he had spoken with after their parade . The Freedom Fighters . The average Freedom Fighter had a distressing tendency to look like any fifteen-yearold greaser embracing an M-18 . " What did the Guevaristas do to you ? " he had asked one youth . " Why are you here ? " The youth looks at the ground , then into space . " Gueyas very bad , " he says to the interpreter , who amplifies , " Much oppression . " Biller persists . " What did they do to you ? How did they oppress you ? " The boy says something angry . " They wanted to recruit him for the Army , " the interpreter explains . " But you 're in the Army now , " Biller says against his better judgment . " Gue army very bad ! " The interpreter smiles ravishingly . " Here is more better .
