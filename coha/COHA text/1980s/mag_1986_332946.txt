" Your assignment is to find that it was an intruder , " a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister told Seymour Hersh when he arrived in Moscow in 1984 . The dogged reporter was beginning his investigation into Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , which the Soviets shot down in their airspace on its way from Anchorage to Seoul , killing all 269 aboard . Had Hersh indeed uncovered proof that the plane was on a spy mission , he would have scored one of the scoops of the century . Instead he has done something no less impressive : followed where the facts led him and produced a gripping account undistorted by preordained conclusions . " I spent the next two years investigating , " he writes in the September issue of the Atlantic , " and found that Flight 007 was not on an intelligence-gathering mission for the CIA or any other agency of the United States or South Korea . " <P> That conclusion is convincing coming from Hersh , who has written a string of notable exposes of the CIA for the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the My Lai massacre and published a scathing book on Henry Kissinger , The Price of Power . His Atlantic article is excerpted from his book on Flight 007 , The Target Is Destroyed , which will be published next month by Random House . <P> Hersh does not completely exonerate Washington . American intelligence officials , he says , quickly learned from intercepts of internal Soviet communications that panicky Soviet air-defense officials had not realized their target was a civilian airliner . Yet the U.S. continued to insist in public that the shootdown was a callous act of murder . President Reagan and his top advisers , Hersh argues , " chose to look the other way when better information became available . " Attributing the wayward course of Flight 007 to the " ordinary human failings of the Korean Air Lines crew , " Hersh presents new evidence that supports a scenario first posited by Harold Ewing , a commercial pilot from South Carolina who conducted his own investigation . It is a sophisticated version of the theory that the flight engineer made critical mistakes in entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hersh concludes that to save time and fuel , the pilot intentionally skipped one navigation way point and , while over the ocean , left the cockpit to sit with some important passengers . <P> The most intriguing aspects of Hersh 's account are the details he has unearthed about how U.S. spy planes in the North Pacific observe Soviet missile tests and intercept communications . One of these missions was under way the night of the disaster . The U.S. electronically monitored the path of + the KAL jet , but the information , says Hersh , " was not understood , or ' analyzed , ' in time to warn Flight 007 . " Later , Hersh says , U.S. data confirmed that the Soviets had thought the passenger plane was one of the spy flights . Secret intercepts by the National Security Agency , which were described to Hersh , reveal that the Soviet officials in the region had trouble getting a secure voice link to Moscow that night , initially had to use an open line and were put on hold waiting for authorization to shoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Soviets were unsure what they had downed.
