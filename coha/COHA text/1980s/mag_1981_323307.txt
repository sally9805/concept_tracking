A year later , lethal Mount St. Helens blossoms with life <P> One of the wonders-and blessings-of the world is the immense power of nature to regenerate itself , the tenacity that all life shows as it tries to heal its wounds and survive . Nowhere is this capacity more evident today than in southwestern Washington . It is just a year since Mount St. Helens exploded with a blast releasing 500 times as much energy as the bomb that leveled Hiroshima , and sending a cubic mile of earth into the air . Torrents of hot mud went coursing down the mountainside , flattening trees for miles around and turning the Toutle River into a flood of sludge that swept away several bridges . The eruption killed 34 people , demolished 178 homes and devastated hundreds of thousands of acres , much of it rich timber land . By the time the dust cleared , 150 sq . mi. of once green countryside lay lifeless , under what looked like a heavy fall of gray snow . <P> Those who witnessed the devastation thought the land would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will ever see in my life , " recalls Logger Carl McCrary . " It was gray everywhere , no sign of green . " Yet today animals and plants are re-establishing themselves all over the ash-blanketed countryside . Residents of the region are putting their own lives back together too . <P> Evidence of the volcano 's power remains abundant . The high slopes are still covered with tree trunks , some more than 400 years old , some a mere seven , their roots pointing back toward the source of the shock wave that flattened them . Just below the mountain stands Coldwater Lake . A year ago , it was the highly scenic source of a creek that fed the Toutle River . Now the valley through which the Toutle flowed is blocked by a 600-ft. - tall wall of volcanic mud and debris . The lake has been slowly filling with dirty water , threatening to overflow eventually and send a torrent of mud downstream . <P> Above this devastation towers the still threatening mountain itself . Because the explosion literally blew the top off Mount St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8,300 . Its shape has changed from a symmetrical , Fujiyama-like cone to a lopsided pyramid that resembles a broken tooth . Occasionally it still puffs smoke and steam . <P> Only two months after the eruption , small green parsley ferns and skunk cabbage were found pushing through the volcanic ash in sheltered areas along a creek on the mountain slope . Now the pink flowers of fireweed , a low-growing bush that is traditionally one of the first plants to colonize disturbed areas , have begun to add a touch of color to slopes and clear areas , still covered with ash and mud . Lupines are beginning to grow along erosion channels . Tiny fir trees , freed from competition with their fallen parents , are expected to take advantage of the extra sunlight and make a quick comeback . Scientists say that nutrients from the volcanic ash-such as phosphorus and potassium-could actually enhance their growth . As if to prove the point , some farm areas that were dusted with ash had record harvests of wheat and apples last year .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
