 | Some women seem to have everything , till a closer look reveals otherwise . Anna Murdoch , however , even under very close scrutiny , does appear to have it all . At 43 , she is blonde and beautiful , with big light-blue eyes and thick pale hair swinging around her shoulders . Wellknown in her own right as the best-selling author of two novels , In Her Own Image and currently Family Business , she is also the wife of one of the richest and most controversial men in America , media mogul Rupert Murdoch . She has three teenage children ? Elisabeth , 19 , and sons Lachlan , 16 , and James , 15 ? and six homes in various parts of the world , including a mansion in Beverly Hills , a Colorado ski-house with a huge indoor swimming pool , and a New York City penthouse whose terrace overlooks Central Park . In short , she leads a life that might come straight out of the pages of a book ? perhaps one of hers . Yet things were n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born into a high-powered , glamorous life-style . In fact , such a life would have seemed like a crazy dream even when she married Rupert Murdoch 21 years ago . She was born Anna Maria Torv , in Glasgow , Scotland , the eldest of four children . Her mother was Scottish , her father Estonian . When she was nine , her family sold their business , a dry cleaners , and left Scotland for Sydney , Australia . There they borrowed money to buy land which they turned into a picnic and sports area . However , it was not a success . " My mother worked even harder at it than my father , " Anna remembers now . But eventually the place was repossessed by the bank . My mother developed tuberculosis and had a complete breakdown . " She sighs . " Losing all your money makes you stronger , I think . But it 's very , very hard at the time . " After this disaster , her parents divorced . " We four children remained with my father , who 'd gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I became the mother for the younger ones , who were nine , six , and two . " The family was Catholic , and Anna attended a convent school . She had only one dress to wear , so every night she washed it . and every morning ironed it . Even on Sundays , when she went with her family to Mass , she had to wear the same dress , freshly ironed . She longed to write , but there was no money available for her to go to college . At 19 , she was beautiful , but very shy and unsure of herself . " I had to get a job , " she says . " I applied for one at the Sydney Daily Mirror and got it . " The publisher of the Mirror was Rupert Murdoch . Not surprisingly , it was months before the new " cadet " reporter met him . When she finally did , they were mutually impressed . He thought , " Wow ! " She thought he was vital , tense , handsome . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was married . Within four years , Murdoch would acquire ownership of his first three Australian newspapers , get a divorce , and fall in love with the beautiful blonde reporter . " We came from completely different backgrounds , " says Anna . " The Murdochs were a famous Australian family . I 'm sure they thought I was a girl from the wrong side of the tracks . " Still , when the pair married , Murdoch 's mother and his daughter by his first marriage came to the wedding . After a honeymoon in Jamaica , the newlyweds settled down in Sydney , where daughter Elisabeth was born . Immediately after , however , Murdoch bought his first two English newspapers , and the family moved to London . " We settled down in England for the next six years , " Anna says . " Both our sons were born there . But because I was pregnant a lot of the time , and because I was homesick for Australia , I was never happy there . Not the way I am here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought his first American property , the Star , and the family left England for America , where today the Murdoch empire includes newspapers , magazines , books , TV stations , and 20th Century-Fox film studios . Anna devoted herself to being a wife and mother . But when her youngest son started school , she decided to fulfill her own lifelong dream of going to college . " I was especially interested in writing courses . " she said . Because of her family , she attended classes only between six and eight at night . " That way , the household was normal all day . And at night Rupert got used to eating his dinner after eight , " she says , laughing . She got her Bachelor of Arts degree  | from New York University in 1979 , and her Master 's degree in 1984 . " Rupert and our three children came to see Mommy graduate , " she remembers . " They sat in the broiling sun for three hours watching the graduation exercise . . . then we had a champagne lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was basically developed from essays written for her NYU courses . " But everything written is developed from unexpected sources , " says Anna . " We writers are all magpies ? picking up whatever intriguing tidbit we find to carry off with us . " She is a packrat about what she has already written . When the original manuscript for Family Business was half written ( a bulky 300 pages ) , she carried it with her on trips wherever she went . " Rupert thought I was mad because I always hid it someplace in the hotel room when we went out for dinner , " she says . " But what if someone had thrown it out while we were gone ? " At home in New York , her day starts at 6:30 A.M. when she gets out of her king-size bed to awaken her youngest , James , the only Murdoch child still attending a Manhattan school . After a breakfast of orange juice , toast , and coffee , shared with James and her husband ? if he is not away on business ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing by 9:00 A.M. and friends are requested not to telephone until after one . At four o'clock every day , she has tea . If she is in New York , it is served in her bedroom with its panoramic view of Central Park . If the day is chilly , she sits before a crackling fire . Above the mantelpiece is a large portrait of herself painted in England about 15 years ago . It shows her standing barefoot on a beach , wearing a long , flowing green gown . Two-thirds of the huge picture is empty beach . " One friend says that the empty space represents Rupert because he 's never around , " she says . Because of Murdoch 's endless absences on business trips , his family often carries on without him . Some nine years ago , for instance , Anna decided to return to the Catholic faith after a long lapse . " I 'd had a teenage fallingout with the Church , " she says . " But finally I began missing the strength it gives one in a crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were baptized and then confirmed as well . A few years later , she took the children on a trip to Estonia in search of their roots . They met Estonian relatives , but she has rarely mentioned the trip since . " Very depressing , very sad , " she remarked to friends . Anna Murdoch has become almost a symbol of " having it all . " In addition to her writing career , she has successfully guided three teenage children through today 's perilous environment . " None is on drugs , " she says , smiling . " But one son went through a three-earring period with pierced ears . " She has many firm friends , and maintains a happy marriage under high-pressure circumstances . Says her husband , " I 'm sure I 'd have been a lesser person if I had n't had her beside me . " " I guess I lead a number of different lives ? you give parts of yourself to all these houses and projects and people , " she sums up . " But I really enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . It 's a waste of one 's energy and time to worry about things you ca n't fix . "
