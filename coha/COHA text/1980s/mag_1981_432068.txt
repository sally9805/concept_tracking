 | So many Japanese tourists are crowding into the Grand Canyon that the National Park Service has hired a ranger from Japan to help with language problems . Arab patrons are so numerous at California 's Beverly Hilton : that the hotel has dropped pork from its menu and extended room service to 2:30 a.m. to accommodate Middle Easterners ' eating habits . Those are just two examples of how the American tourism industry is adjusting to the rush of foreign visitors to the United States , a surge that continues despite worldwide economic problems , higher air fares and a strong dollar that reduces the values of other currencies . " We keep getting foreign visitors in record numbers because , even though our prices are higher than before , we 're still a bargain , " says Eldon MacEachern , a foreign-visitor specialist at the U.S. Travel Service . USTS , a Commerce Department agency , predicts that 24 million tourists from abroad will come to the U.S. this year , up 7 percent from the 22.5 million who came last year . Though the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue spending heavily . Paul G. Hall , market analyst at USTS , predicts that they will spend 14.5 billion dollars here this year , up about 19 percent from last year . While delighted with the extra money , the American travel industry is scrambling to cope with the added difficulties caused by an influx of travelers less familiar than those in the past with U.S. speech and customs . Special recruit . " We had to do something , " says Roger Giddings of the National Park Service at the Grand Canyon . " Last year , our Japanese visitors numbered about 300,000 , or 60 percent of all our foreign tourists . Most of them came on tours with bilingual guides , but a large number did not , and those people probably received an inadequate explanation of the canyon . " To help the Park Service cope , Masahiro Ohta , 40 , a ranger from Japan , will join the Grand Canyon staff in early July to give lectures , translate brochures into Japanese and aid travelers in distress . At the Hilton in Beverly Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all rooms for July are taken by foreign guests . " So we just accept the challenge , " says General Manager Charles Bolla . " We used to close room service at 12:30 in the morning , but we added 2 hours because we found so many Middle Eastern guests eat late . " For those guests , mostly Saudis and Kuwaitis , the hotel has a chef in charge of room service who speaks Arabic and a gourmet menu that includes roast leg of lamb and a special rice . The front-desk staff can handle 13 languages . Bolla explains : " Many of our foreign visitors are affluent and speak English , but they find it comforting to know that we take the trouble to accommodate them . It 's a nice gesture ? it shows we care . " Bill Edwards , Hilton Hotels president , says that virtually all of the chain 's 46 owned or operated hotels in the U.S. print menus and signs in several languages , hire bilingual or trilingual staffers and change foreign currency at cashier windows . Other large hotels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Waldorf-Astoria , which greeted its first foreign guests , the King and Queen of Siam ? now Thailand ? in 1931 . The Waldorf staff speaks 27 languages , operates 24-hour room service and in the last year has installed an international desk in the main lobby that operates 14 hours a day seven days a week . When foreign VIP 's visit , says Frances Borden , public-relations director , the Waldorf " will call their embassies and find out what their favorite beverages are and whether they like soft or hard pillows and mattresses . " Starting September 1 , the hotel will print menus in six languages , adding German and Italian to its current reper- toire of English , Spanish , French and Japanese . Multilingual menus are gradually finding their way into restaurants outside hotels . A pioneer with such listings has been Victoria Station , a nationwide chain of 100 restaurants . Some airlines have extra planes available to cope with special baggage needs of wealthy overseas travelers , especially those from Latin America , " who come here in droves and buy everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transport Association . Gorson and others tell of South American visitors ' going to discount stores in New York and Miami , buying huge televisions and refrigerators , filling footlockers with transistor radios and clothing , and asking airlines to ship the appliances and trunks home . To alleviate the space problem last year , Eastern Air Lines chartered some small C-46 cargo planes , and Pan American World Airways used its own cargo jumbo jets to fly extra loads of purchases to Latin America . In a variety of other ways , the nation is responding to the challenges of added foreign tourists : The federal government will start a one-stop inspection experiment in midsummer to speed the airport-entry process for foreign travelers coming to Miami and Los Angeles . They will undergo visa , customs and agriculturalproducts checks all at one time . Gray Line Sightseeing affiliates in New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco and Washington have started regularly scheduled tours twice a day in Spanish , German , French and Japanese . American Telephone &; Telegraph has dispatched 18-page brochures called " Getting Around the U.S.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . In addition , many businesses are springing up around the country to make foreign visitors feel at home . Example : Responding to the surge in British tourism in Miami , two English-style pubs have opened in the Sunny Isles section of Miami Beach ? complete with dart boards and British beer . Cultural puzzles . Many of the adjustments are being made to accommodate the changing nature of foreign tourists . Until a few years ago , they came overwhelmingly from Canada and , to a lesser extent , Mexico and Europe . Now , they come from most continents , and growing numbers of tourists find they are puzzled as much by American culture as language . The Park Service is one organization that is devoting increasing attention to coping with strangers . Rangers are being trained to understand that some peoples from Northern and Eastern Africa are offended if touched by the left hand , which in their societies is considered unclean . Park officials also offer information about American antilittering laws to people from countries such as Japan and Venezuela that do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom strayed from traditional attractions such as New York City , Niagara Falls and Los Angeles . Now , however , they visit virtually all regions of the country . Douglas C. Frechtling , director of the U.S. Travel Data Center , says Canadians , who used to flock mainly to the West Coast , " are now stretching themselves out on the Jersey , Texas and Florida shores as well . " Japanese , who once stayed mainly in Guam or Hawaii , are now all over the country ? as likely to be in a Las Vegas nightclub as in a Rodeo Drive shop in Beverly Hills . Although the language barrier is a growing problem for foreign tourists , many find Americans willing to go to great lengths to help them . Last fall , two German women who spoke no English ran out of money while visiting Yellowstone National Park . They needed funds for gasoline to get to Denver to catch a plane for their return trip to Berlin . Park official Joan Anzelmo , who speaks some German , was able to help them secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and later , through a relative , sent her a thank-you letter with a small toy bear , which they noted was a symbol of Berlin as well as Yellowstone . A decade of growth in foreign tourism has made more travel experts aware of what visitors want , but occasionally even veteran agents are surprised ? especially by the extravagance of some travelers . Recently , for example , two South American couples traveling together entered the gift shop at Sea World in Orlando , Fla . The wives simultaneously spied pearl necklaces , one costing $3,400 and the other $3,000 . Both wanted the more expensive item . One woman grabbed her purse , plucked out $3,400 in cash and bought it . Undaunted , the other woman pulled $3,000 in cash from her purse and took the other necklace ? all taking place within 30 seconds . Reasons William D. Toohey , president of the Travel Industry Association of America : " Foreign tourists are still flocking here , despite higher prices , because their perception is that the U.S. is on sale . " Nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. visits , some have such serious problems that their dream holidays turn into nightmares . In early May , a Swiss woman who spoke no English was killed while walking near her Washington , D.C. , hotel . Police speculated that she might have been slain because she could not understand the robber who stole her purse . Crime against tourists also has been reported in various resorts such as Hawaii , where travelers have been victims of rapes , beatings and robberies . For the most part , foreign tourists ' problems are not violent . This year the most common headache is the declining value of foreign currency and rising prices for hotels , restaurants and transportation here . Other persisting problems : Language and cultural difficulties . Some visitors in Florida could not read the words " men " and " women " on restroom doors . In Houston , a Londoner left his laundry outside his room one night , expecting , according to European custom , that it would be cleaned and returned . Instead , it was stolen . " We ca n't prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president , Travel Industry Association of America . " But with better understanding of languages and lifestyles , we can solve a lot of them .
