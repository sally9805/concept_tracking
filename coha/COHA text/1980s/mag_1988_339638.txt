It is one of the least publicized achievements of the computer revolution : a huge , arching communications network connecting 60,000 computers by high-speed data links and ordinary telephone lines . Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s , Arpanet , as the information grid is called , has carried everything from unclassified military data to electronic love notes sent from one lonely researcher to another . But last week it became the conduit for something much more dramatic : one of the most sophisticated and infectious computer viruses the world has yet seen . <P> The trouble surfaced in computer centers at two institutions that serve as major network links : M.I.T. and the University of California , Berkeley . Last Wednesday night computers at both centers started furiously generating unwanted electronic files , clogging up their storage systems and slowing operations to a crawl . Almost immediately , similar problems began turning up at other centers throughout the network , from the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington to New Mexico 's Los Alamos National Laboratory . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to quarantine them , severing their connections to other computers and rendering productive work all but impossible . <P> Last week 's infection was the latest manifestation of an epidemic of viruses that has struck the U.S. in the past year . Similar to its biological counterpart , an electronic virus is a program that copies itself by taking control of a computer 's internal machinery . Unlike more malicious versions , the new virus did not destroy data stored in computers , but it did disrupt the work of tens of thousands of researchers hooked into Arpanet . It also penetrated unclassified branches of a second , more secure network called Milnet , which is used by military researchers . Said a Government computer expert : " The kid simply put us out of action . " <P> " The kid , " according to the New York Times , turned out to be Robert T. Morris Jr. , a 23-year-old graduate student at Cornell University . His father is Robert Morris Sr. , chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in Maryland . The center , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government computers from outside attack . The elder Morris , who was one of the first researchers to experiment with viruses at AT &T's; Bell Laboratories in the early 1960s , when they were still considered a game , is a top expert on combating the kind of sabotage in which his son allegedly engaged . The father would not discuss the case in detail , but admitted that his son was " very well trained in computer science " and said the episode sounded like " the work of a bored graduate student .
