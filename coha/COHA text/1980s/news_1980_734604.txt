txt THE NEXT President of the United Staten will he Jimmy Carter . This prediction will please some of you and anger others , but put it down In your memory book , folks . And remember , you heard it from Andy the Greek , the same ' man who thought the New York Giants would win the Super Bowl this year . I am not a political pundit . I 'm just a person , but it does n't look to me as though anyone can beat him . You look at the primary results and read the polls and you can see all of us scanning the horizon for shmeone wonderful to vote for . Most of us do n't see anything out there but haze , Some Republicans have grasped at John Anderson because he has sounded moderately intelligent and different , but he is only different from other Republi- cans . SOME DEMOCRATS see Edward Kennedy as their savior . If Teddy Kennedy were John F. Kennedy or even if he were George or Hubert Humphrey , he might have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two people who look very good to me as potential Presidents right now are Howard Baker and John Connally . The minute they dropped out of the race I said to myself , " Now , here are two guys smart enough to be President . " On the other hand , I would n't dream of voting for Ted Kennedy because he has n't been smart enough to drop out yet . It is obvious now , though , that the two teams that have made the finals are the Reagan team and the Carter team . If you have a chance to bet on who finishes in second place , bet on Reagan . Reagan Is obviously going to be Carter 's opponent . HO a bright , charming candidate with governing experience in California that his opponents ca n't deny . He 's had the same experience for the job in California that Carter had in Georgia . Ronald Reagan is no longer a movie actor any more than Byron White of the Supreme Court is a football player he-cause he was once All American . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . There Is a strange phenomenon work- ing in Carter 's favor In this campaign and it Is hate . There are large numbers of people who hate Ronald Reagan with the same fervor that they hated Richard Nixon . On the other side , there are hordes of Americans who detest Teddy Kennedy with an intensity usually reserved for people like Hitler . No one hates Jimmy Carter . There are people who do n't like him , there are people who think he 's an inadequate bumbler , and there are people who think he 's leading the country to ruin . But they do n't hate him . Most recent polls show that Carter 's popularity Is sharply down . People are saying he 's not doing a good job . Inflation , Iran , and the Olympics are all damaging issues in the polls but when it comes down to the vote , people seem more willing that they once were to accept the fact that being President is a tough job . CARTER IS probably even lucky to have those issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam . They either thought we should stay in the war and win it or they thought we shout get out . Things are different now . Amer cans do n't have any clear opinion abot whether raising the lending rate is goin to help or hurt inflation . They do n't Imp , what steps should be taken to free tt hostages and they could n't locate A ghanistan on a map in anything short r 20 minutes . They may . not like President Cartel but they are willing to trust him in they matters . " He 's doing a lousy job , they 're saying , " But he 's honest and he trying . " This is absolutely fabulous high prah from the public for any politician office . We do n't ever say anything nice than that about one of them . A foreign would n't understand that but it 's true . 1 Russia you 're apt to disappear in th middle of the night if you 're too critic ' of the leaders . We do things different ) here . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying nie things about politicians . There is n't much doubt about It . Th incumbent will be cumbent again .
