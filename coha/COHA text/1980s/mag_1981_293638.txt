COLLECTED STORIES by Frank O'Connor Knopf ; 702 pages ; $20 <P> Frank O'Connor ( 1903-1966 ) once described the short story as " the literature of submerged population groups . " It is a regional definition with an old-fashioned thump of authenticity . O'Connor , born Michael O'Donovan in Cork , was no innovator . His stories lowered the reader directly into the weedy , half-lit world of Irish town life . <P> O'Connor 's literary roots owed much to small-town gossip . His father was a laborer who measured his days in pints . But the future writer had a strong mother figure in Minnie O'Donovan . She put bread on the table by working as a domestic , and acquired a taste for the classics by reading her employers ' books . Minnie passed the love of Shakespeare and poetry on to her son . He later returned the love by publishing under her maiden name . <P> O'Connor , too , was largely self-taught . In 1923 he filled the gaps in his education while imprisoned for republican activities during the Irish civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers like Sean O'Faolain and Liam O'Flaherty . In 1931 O'Connor made his name with a book of stories entitled Guests of the Nation . <P> The title story of that collection leads off this regathering of many of the author 's best-known works , including The Long Road to Ummera , The Bridal Night and My Oedipus Complex , one of the most amusing pieces ever written about a small boy 's anger over having to share his mother with her husband . Guests of the Nation suppresses anger with a disillusionment that teeters on mawkishness . Belcher and Awkins are two British soldiers who have become rather friendly with their Irish nationalist captors . The order to execute the pair is carried out with misgivings , especially since the condemned men remain amiable to the end . It is not quite believable , and the use of dialect is stagy . Yet the story retains power because O'Connor 's honesty as an observer survives his most melodramatic techniques . <P> The author 's " submerged population " swims through an eternity of Irish religion , poverty and social riches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trouble and comedy . The tumultuous courtship in The Masculine Principle is as psychologically complex as a Henry James relationship , though more lively . Another character , who forgets that his wife is having a baby and buys fish instead of fetching a doctor , is a man to remember . <P> It is a horseplaying priest , however , who best expresses O'Connor 's unhappy but indissoluble Gaelic family . " O Lord , " he prays , " a man gives up the whole world for You ... his friends and his job , and goes off to a bare mountain where he ca n't even tell his troubles to the man alongside him ; and still he keeps something back , some little thing to remind him of what he gave up . With me ' t was the horses and with this man ' t was the sup of beer , and I dare say there are fellows inside who have a bit of a girl 's hair hidden somewhere they can go and look at it now and again . I suppose we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as small as it is , the whole world is in it , and bit by bit it grows on us again till the day You find us out . " Frank O'Connor always got there between the hiding and the finding . - ByR.Z . Sheppard
