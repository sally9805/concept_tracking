WASHINGTON  --  The House Democratic leadership panel recommended that Rep. Charles Bennett of Florida replace the repudiated chairman of the Armed Services Committee Les Aspin , but Texas Rep. Marvin Leath remains the favorite to win the position . Yesterday ' s decision by the Steering and Policy Committee came on a secret 16-11 vote and marks the second time the 76-year-old Democrat from Jacksonville has been endorsed for the chairmanship . But even with the support of that panel , Mr. Bennett was defeated two years ago by Rep. Aspin of Wisconsin , who failed to win a vote of confidence from his colleagues on Wednesday . The unusually bitter and complex battle for the powerful chairmanship was swiftly transformed into a four-way race yesterday , with Mr. Aspin vowing to reclaim the chairmanship and Rep. Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts joining the challengers . The endorsement of Mr. Bennett by the Democratic panel , a polite but perhaps empty bow to seniority , opened a two-week campaign for the chairmanship . The matter is to be decided by a series of ballots in which the candidate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ' s time , the character of the battle seemed to shift from a referendum on the politics and personality of Mr. Aspin , who courted liberals two years ago and then alienated them by siding with the administration on important votes , to a test of the loyalty and strength that Mr. Leath has built during his campaign for the chairmanship over the past several months . " I can ' t see how Aspin can get any stronger than he was Wednesday , " said Mr. Mavroules , a former mayor of Peabody , Mass. , who is stressing his efforts on overhauling the Pentagon ' s procurement operations and his opposition to the MX missile , which Mr. Aspin advocated . " I ' m the liberal who can be trusted , " Mr. Mavroules said . Mr. Bennett , who has served in Congress for three dozen years , is basing his claim to the chairmanship largely on seniority , the very principle fractured when Mr. Aspin ascended to the chairmanship in 1985 . But the momentum remains with Mr. Leath , 55 , a conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year . " In the last two years I ' ve had reason to move ( my positions ) , " said Mr. Leath . " When you have reason to move and when it ' s beneficial for you to move , you do it . " It was Mr. Aspin ' s proclivity to change his position , principally on supporting the MX and aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels , that got him in trouble in the first place . Questions were raised among his colleagues about his trustworthiness . Mr. Leath ' s allies seized on this discontent , with some of them suggesting that Mr. Aspin ' s inflated expectations about retaining the chairmanship grew out of false assurances from colleages who considered themselves betrayed . " Say you ' re with Les , " Mr. Leath ' s supporters acidly advised colleagues in the days before he was repudiated . " He said he was with you . " With Mr. Aspin still in the race , Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado , a potential contender for the position and an Aspin supporter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he ' s in , " she said , " I can ' t get in .
