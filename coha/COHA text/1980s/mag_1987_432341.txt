The Spanish are hot blooded , the French make love , the Germans fight , the English carry on , the Irish drink . If that does n't offend you , how about : the Jews make money and the blacks got rhythm ? National and ethnic stereotyping is stupid and dangerous , so an exhibit like " Hispanic Art in the United States " sets off some alarms . Is a generalization about such art ? for example , that it 's passionate ? a compliment or is it racist ? Does the show confine Hispanic artists to a cultural ghetto or does it introduce them to the mainstream ? Is it an exhibit of art or a making of amends ? The curators of the exhibit , John Beardsley and Jane Livingston , understand such questions . Their answers therefore deserve attention . After seeing this richly varied show , for example , cheap stereotyping becomes more difficult . The result of more than 100 studio visits , the exhibit , which was organized by Houston 's Museum of Fine Arts , includes 180 works by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are well known to the art world . Most are not . Having opened in Houston , the exhibit goes to the Corcoran Gallery in Washington in October and then to Miami , Santa Fe , Mexico City , Los Angeles and Brooklyn . Together with the Indianapolis Museum 's " Art of the Fantastic : Latin America , 1920-1987 " ( part of which travels to Queens , Miami and Mexico City ) , the effusion of Hispanic culture ought to snap open a few eyes . It 's about time , too . Nothing has more powerful implications for American culture than the influx of Hispanics into the United States . Much of the southern rim has a Spanish accent ; eventually Hispanics will be the largest American minority . Their influence is less a matter of numbers , however , than of outlook . While not monolithic ( Cuba is very different from Mexico ) , Hispanic culture differs markedly from the Waspy individualism of North America . As the Mexican writer Octavio Paz says in the catalog , Hispanic culture derives from the Counter-Reformation .

Unlike North American artists , Paz says , Hispanics almost never describe the human image " but rather exalt it or mutilate it ? in either case , transfiguring it . " Hispanic art often resembles neoexpres- sionism but with less irony , more passion . Hispanic artists are often isolated . Even those who exhibit fairly abstract work , such as Carlos Alfonzo or Roberto Juarez , seem to reach toward something beyond the ordinary . Hispanic artists generally twist , force and exaggerate their images , striving for a " too much " quality that lifts the viewer past conventional reality into a realm of phantoms . Many Hispanics use religious images and forms . Some continue traditional Catholic practices , such as the retablo painting ( usually pictures of saints on wooden panels ) of the American Southwest . Others turn religion toward more contemporary concerns . In " God , " for example , Pedro Perez has fashioned an opu-@#  | lent reliquary cross out of gold leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the relic is usually located , is an impish little king with a mad grin . The image sends a chill down the spine , even as it raises a smile to the lips . Still others draw upon Caribbean and pre-Columbian religions . Paul Sierra 's painting has a tropical , almost voodoo charge . The stone blocks of Jesus Bautista Moroles ? at first reminiscent of minimalist sculpture ? also have the stern grandeur of Mayan architecture . Often the fantasy is nightmarish . In " Howl , " Luis Jimenez has created a coyote that ripples like a heat mirage on the horizon . Carlos Almaraz 's " Greed " shows two dogs fighting over a bone in a desert landscape . The animals themselves are frightening : evocative blue-black blurs that seem to spit paint ; the screeching color and slashing paint stroke heighten the terror . What makes Almaraz an artist , however , is the inclusion of an orderly line of three plants : they serve as witness and foil to the mayhem .

Very often the stiffness of the wood has a bowstring tautness , as if the energy in the animal might snap free in our dreams . Even the softer work , such as the Edenic painting of Patricia Gonzalez , contains intimations of death . And the more classical art harbors something decidedly unclassical . The gentlest objects in the show are Lidya Buzio 's pots , yet their curves and the holes cut in the clay distort the Italianate buildings painted on the surface ; under pressure of earth and sky , the buildings yield into fantasy . Robert Graham 's nudes are usually viewed as purely classical , a Hispanic anomaly . Yet his sculpture is so classical , so balanced , so polished ( much as his name is so Anglo ) that it grows strange to the eye . The hard clarity appears necessary to contain something wilder . It is that something ? the contained and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Hispanic artists exaggerate their imagery , they also put their formal devices under great pressure . They abuse traditional color harmonies , fracture line , distort space . They violate canons of taste , working the energetic line between good and bad . As devotees of the fantastic and impatient with the merely material , they often gob on so much of whatever they 're working with ? whether paint or costume jewelry or tinfoil ? that the stuff becomes something more than itself , a kind of material dream . Thickly applied paint , in particular , often seems a kind of magic soil in which the painter can grow his art . When a Hispanic artist with a high-@#  | strung sense of fantasy confronts mainstream American culture , the results are often surprising . Hispanics are particularly good with American pop . They know how to bring out the dream in the material . Roberto Gil de Montes has developed a dark , folklike style , very Mexican in spirit , which nicely evokes the dreams of Hollywood .

In " Our Family Car , " Gilbert Lujan transformed a mere car ? if a ' 50 Chevy can be called " mere " ? into a chariot of the barrio . Hispanics also respond powerfully to the fractured quality of American society . In Paz 's view , Latin culture has never reconciled itself to the modern world ; Hispanics are " fugitives from history . " Certainly an emigrant from a society that stresses communal and religious values will have something important to say about modern America . Many Hispanic artists ? among them Gronk , Lujan and Frank Romero ? came of age when painting communal , politically inspired murals in East Los Angeles was important . Other artists have movingly evoked the isolations of modern life . In the paintings of Arnaldo Roche , the figures appear trapped in the material of the ; painting : in both the paint and the formal figure-ground relationships .

Ramirez unites the Hispanic passions in a bizarrely beautiful world of dreams . He invokes the wanderings and isolation , the expansive inward journeys , the love for animals and feeling for grandeur , the religion that mingles rapture and pain , which characterize Hispanic life in America . The spiked crown and bracelets of his great " Madonna " are at once threatening and starlike . In the fine catalog , the curators have stressed their commitment to the values of art ? to making an exhibit that is more than politics . They were wise to do so , but perhaps worried too much about the show 's purity of purpose . It 's inevitable that values cross . This is both a survey and an act of connoisseurship ; it confines Hispanic artists to their background even as it helps integrate them into American culture . The meeting of Latin and Anglo America in the South has an almost geological character , as of great cultural and historical masses slowly colliding .
