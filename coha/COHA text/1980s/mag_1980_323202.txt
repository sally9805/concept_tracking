El Asnam buries its dead <P> " The hospital walls suddenly split open in front of me . I saw the hole and I jumped through it . " <P> Abdelkader Mayouf , 24 , a medical technician in the Algerian town of El Asnam , recalled his escape as he gazed upon the ruins of the modern , four-story hospital where he had worked . Mayouf had been luckier than the 300 patients who were trapped in their beds when the earthquake struck . <P> Rescue teams continued to search for other possible survivors in the tangled debris of El Asnam last week , but with dwindling chances of finding life . Instead , with increasing frequency , they found more bodies . The killer quake , which created an initial shock of 7.5 on the Richter scale and a rapid succession of 20 other tremors , left fully 80% of the town destroyed . The initial estimate of 25,000 deaths was later reduced by more than half . Still , with the toll already at 6,000 , the El Asnam quake was far worse than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Many bodies of victims were wrapped in white sheets for burial in hillside cemeteries ; others were hastily placed in communal graves . The 80,000 homeless were sheltered in makeshift camps , 30 to a tent , at locations on the outskirts of El Asnam . The quake also opened up 12-ft. - wide fissures in the countryside as much as 30 miles away , destroying scores of villages and leaving an estimated 325,000 rural inhabitants destitute . <P> The tragedy was compounded by the chaos of the first rescue efforts . " People were fighting for a chance to dig out the survivors , " said a Danish journalist . As more help arrived from 30 countries , bringing some $1.5 million worth of aid and equipment , rescuers were often at cross-purposes . Swiss and French avalanche dogs , trained to sniff out buried bodies , were thrown off the scent by powerful disinfectants that were sprayed on buildings to keep decaying bodies from spreading disease . French microphonic devices , flown in to monitor buildings for faint sounds of breathing , were useless in the din of bulldozers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonetheless managed to rescue many of the living . On Wednesday , five days after the quake , a ten-month-old baby girl was found hungry but unhurt . Unlike so many children wandering the streets , she was reunited with older sisters and brothers . By then , with water in short supply , sanitation hazards were increasing , and Algerian officials had begun worrying not only about epidemics but about civil disorder . One convoy was raided by villagers , angry that truckloads of food and medicine were constantly passing them by . Armed soldiers were forced to mount patrols to guard against mass looting of tottering buildings . <P> The Algerian government plans to expand the tent city to house the crowded survivors for three or four months until prefabricated housing can be erected . Meanwhile , the city itself is to be sealed off and leveled to the ground . Surviving residents surveyed their demolished homes and wondered if the fertile Chliff River valley town was even worth rebuilding .
