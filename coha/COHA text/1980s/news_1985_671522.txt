Convinced that you not only can , but also should , take it with you , air passengers eager to avoid waits and lost or damaged baggage are stretching the concept of carry-on luggage to epic proportions , according to a Government inspection and testimony to the Federal Aviation Administration. // // Situation ' Out of Control ' // " Nobody wants to check anything anymore , " said Shirley Campbell , a United Airlines flight attendant . Seeing passengers struggling aboard with paintings , vases and overstuffed garment bags , she recalled , " I often say , ' What are you doing , moving ? I mean , what did you leave at home ? ' " // " Passengers want to carry on luggage - that ' s a fact of life these days , " said Thomas Tripp , manager of technical information for the Air Transport Association . But he said the industry group regarded the existing stowage rule as sufficient and the complaints as exaggerated. // Yet when a national air transportation inspection team surveyed the situation last year as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that airline employees " readily admitted that carry-on baggage is out of control. " // The inspection team estimated that 60 percent of all passengers carried two bags aboard and that an additional 15 percent carried three or more. // Excess carry-on items , it said , frequently inhibit access to emergency equipment and may dislodge in an emergency . Moreover , the extra baggage can throw off calculations of takeoff weight by up to 2 , 500 pounds. // " Passengers aggravate the carry-on baggage problem by trying to trick or sneak items on board , " the inspection report said . " Ladies have been found trying to hide dogs under their hats and in garment bags to avoid buying a carrying case. " // The team further noted , " Through observations and reports during this study , garment bags have been found containing bicycles , typewriters , bowling balls , golf clubs and even an embalmed human body . " <> <> New Rule Under Study // Fred Farrar , a spokesman for the F.A.A. in Washington , said efforts to verify the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible new rule that would for the first time restrict the size of a carry-on bag to 20 inches by 16 inches by 9 inches and perhaps the number of items allowed each passenger. // The only requirement now is that carry-on items must be securely stowed in overhead bins or closets or beneath the seat . But the restriction does not necessarily rule out a surfboard , Christmas tree , auto battery , stained-glass window , television set , statue , antique furniture , stuffed animal or 40 pounds of barbecue , all of which the Association of Flight Attendants says have been carried aboard at one time or another. // The group cited cases in which emergency evacuations were impeded by passengers who tried to slide down escape chutes with their arms full of carry-on bags , and instances when passengers were knocked unconscious by heavy items falling out of the overhead bins. // " Tales of dead bodies and surfboards and dogs under hats - it sounds almost apocryphal , " said Mr. Tripp of the Air Transport Association . " I can ' t believe any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversize and overweight carry-on lug-gage is not new , but it has taken on new significance with today ' s intensified competition and speeded-up boarding procedures that often eliminate check-ins at counters . <> <> Fear of Losing Business // According to the Association of Flight Attendants , which has been most vocal in demanding a crackdown , the airlines have been reluctant to enforce existing limitations for fear of driving passengers to a more permissive rival. // Many airlines have seemingly encouraged passengers to carry more aloft by greatly expanding the size of the overhead compartments. // Mr. Tripp said it was " a chicken and egg " question whether the larger bins brought forth the increased carry-on luggage , or the other way around. // New boarding procedures also work against close supervision of carry-on luggage . In the past , passengers had to check in at an airline counter , giving ticket agents a chance to look over the luggage and insist that oversize or excess pieces be checked in. // Today , however , many airlines , in an effort to streamline procedures , assign seats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go directly to the departure gates if they want. // The security people who X-ray all carry-on baggage are not concerned about the number of pieces . So the first airline employee to screen the carry-on luggage is often the flight attendant on the plane. // By then it is too late , and arguments often ensue . <> <> Passengers ' Complaints // " I once had this lady who had so much stuff I kept taking pieces away , " recalled Jana McLeland , chairman of the safety committee of the flight attendants group in New York . " During the flight I heard a noise in the closet and looked in and there she was , with her bags . She said she wouldn ' t be separated from them. " // The passengers have their own side of the story. // " If I can ' t carry it with me , I don ' t take it , " said Paul M. Klein , who staggered off an Eastern Air Lines jet at La Guardia with a garment bag slung over one shoulder , a duffel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mr. Klein , director of a tourism research institute at St. Thomas of Villanova University in Miami , said the time he would have wasted waiting at airport baggage carousels easily outweighed the load on his back. // Ann Bisenius and Frieda Braun of Brookfield , Conn. , arrived for their flight to Hilton Head Island , S.C. , clutching garment bags and suitcases that they were determined to hold onto , along with their remembrance of luggage lost on trips past. // Some passengers have special concerns . Rick Bodelle , an application engineer for the West German FAG bearings corporation , said he was not about to entrust to checked baggage the 3 1/2-foot-long Geiger counter on a metal pole that he was delivering to a customer in Florida. // " Stewardesses sometimes ask me what it is , but in a nice way , " he said . He said he liked to show them how the radiation level at 35 , 000 feet could be 100 times that on Earth. // Baggage mishaps make up the second biggest catagory of passenger complaints , after flight problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board. // Last year , 1 , 816 passengers were dissatisfied enough to take their baggage complaints to the Government , up from 1 , 430 in 1983 . There is no way of knowing , officials said , how many other problems were resolved by the airlines. //
