Junior Great Books give kids the classy and the classic <P> Say " Great Books , " and most people think of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas , not Jack and the Beanstalk . But Jack has won a place , along with Winnie-the-Pooh , The Jungle Books and excerpts from James Thurber , in a respected and fast-growing reading program called Junior Great Books . Created for elementary and secondary schoolchildren by the Chicago-based Great Books Foundation , the reading-discussion program does not aim to " teach " the classics . It tries , instead , to teach young people to enjoy good books and to understand better whatever they read . Explains Edwin P. Moldof , the foundation 's vice president : " A great story is one with inexhaustible implications . " <P> Currently , some 400,000 U.S. youngsters are Junior Great Bookies , up from 200,000 just two years ago . They get their own paperbound copies of a dozen carefully selected readings and meet to discuss them , usually once a week in a 45-minute session , with the foundation-trained leaders . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are teachers . <P> J.G.B. 's success is based on an intelligently demanding choice of texts , a discussion method called " shared inquiry , " and on precise , literate questions calculated to unlock the pleasures and mysteries in each story 's heart . For both students and discussion leaders there are some unusual rules . Program leaders ask questions about the readings but , unlike traditional teachers , are not permitted to give answers . Their questions , many of them suggested by accompanying instrucion booklets , are supposed to have more than one answer . Sample suggestion for Kipling 's Jungle Books : " Why do the wolves feel they need a leader in order to be free ? " Students are permitted to answer only if they have actually read the selection . Each selection is supposed to be read twice , and answers must be based only on specific evidence from the text . Nobody can get away with the kind of book review snow jobs that everyone remembers , such as " really exciting " or " kind of boring . " <P> In Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded rather than punished for taking objects from the giant ? ( A possible answer : Jack paid with his mother 's cow for the beans that grew into the giant 's beanstalk . Possible comeback : But he did n't pay the giant . ) Does Jack succeed because of magic , good luck or his own efforts ? ( The story includes some evidence of all three . ) The students also mull over different characterizations of Jack and the giant in two different versions of the story . <P> In theory , the application of shared inquiry techniques to Jack sounds a bit like breaking a butterfly on a wheel . But in practice teachers find the method leads to sharp debate , not hot air . Says Moldof , who , along with Great Books Foundation President Richard P. Dennis , first dreamed up the program : " Kids do n't have to worry about searching for the answer the teacher already knows . They just have to back up what they say . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
