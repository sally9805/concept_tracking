 | Thomas Jefferson called the lottery " a wonderful thing ; it lays taxation only on the willing . " All over New York state last week the willing lined up to pay , drawn by a chance at a $41 million dream , the largest jackpot in North American history . The queues snaked around street corners in . rain-soaked New York City and stretched along rural roads upstate . " It 's got hold of me like a fever ? I ca n't shake it , " said 73-year-old Gerald Williams in Harlem , who spent $75 of his monthly pension check on tickets ? and fought the urge to run home for the $50 he keeps for emergencies . In midtown Manhattan , executives lined up on their lunch hour ? and discussed strategies for maximizing their fantasy returns . In tiny Amenia , N.Y. , one Connecticut septuagenarian waited five hours in line ? only to collapse when he finally got to the counter , taking a rack of newspapers with him to the floor . His first words after being revived : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee decided to play just a few hours before the drawing ? and got 20 of his colleagues at a printing-press factory in Mt . Vernon to join him . Most were immigrants , hailing from faraway places like China and Poland ; each put up $1 and signed a contract in broken English promising to share any winnings " equally and fairly to each other . " Some did n't know they 'd hit the big one until they showed up for work the next morning and found pandemonium in the shop . Sharing their prize with a Brooklyn man and an Albany woman who also held winning tickets , the " lucky 21 " will receive about $24,000 each per year in 21 payments over the next 20 years ? probably not enough to retire on but more than sufficient to restore faith in fairy tales . Said Celso Manuel Garcete from Paraguay , who selected the winning numbers : " I 'm excited . I ca n't believe it . " Millions share his excitement , if not his luck . Seventeen states and the District of Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netting more than $3 billion in profits for state coffers and creating one new lucky millionaire , on average , every day . Revenues are expected to jump another 20 percent this year , with more states anteing in . Last week Iowa kicked off its first lottery ? an instant game ? with a " mass scratch-off " at the Iowa State Fair . Next week Maine , Vermont and New Hampshire will inaugurate the first TriState Megabucks , pooling resources to keep state residents from playing neighboring Massachusetts 's game . California 's lottery , set to start this fall , is expected to be the biggest in the world , grossing $6.8 million a day ( page 19 ) . These fiscal fortunes have not gone unnoticed in Washington . Three bills are pending in the House of Representatives to create a national lottery to help shore up social security , Medicare or retire the federal deficit . " It captures the imagination , " says Rep. Thomas Luken of Ohio , who estimates that a national game could bring in $10 billion a year . Slim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too does debate over whether lotteries are an appropriate way for governments to raise revenue . Critics charge that state-sponsored gambling erodes the work ethic and abets " undesirable elements . " Lottery ads also mislead players about the size of possible winnings after taxes and inflation ( chart ) and downplay the sky-high odds . " They are always promoted with the idea that you 're going to win , when in fact your chances are slim to none , " says Minnesota state Rep. Gil Gutknecht . What 's more , states are becoming dangerously addicted to gaming revenues , forcing lottery officials into a constant search for ways to lure players at a time when multimillion-dollar jackpots have become routine . New York 's buying frenzy last week came after a threemonth slump in Lotto sales ? and the jackpot reached $41 million in part because officials had lengthened the odds of winning to 1 in 6.1 million . " We were victims of our own success , " concedes New York lottery director John Quinn . Chief among the concerns is that lotteries amount to a regressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Maryland study found that the poorest one-third of state houseolds bought half of all weekly lottery tickets ? and 60 percent of daily-game tickets . " Seventy percent of those who buy my tickets are poor , black or Hispanic , " says newsstand mogul Rasik Patel , New York 's busiest lottery agent . Some critics have accused lottery officials of deliberately targeting minority players in inner-city neighborhoods ? particularly for daily games patterned after the illegal numbers rackets . " A lottery is the sale of an illusion to poor people who view it as the only possibility for breaking out of the cycle of poverty they live in , " says Weston Ware of the Baptist Christian Life Commission in Texas . " It 's bad public policy , bad social policy and bad moral policy for the state to huck-@#  | ster or be its own bookie for its people . " Lottery officials counter that most ticket buyers are middle class . ( And at least one community ? the near-broke borough of West Homestead , Pa. ? is a regular player . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BMW crowd , " says Connecticut lottery chief J. Blaine Lewis Jr . Proponents also say the argument that the poor need to be protected from themselves smacks of elitist paternalism ? and most players agree . " They did n't walk me down here and force me to stand in line . It 's my choice , " said Gerald Williams in Harlem last week . " The big difference between Lotto and life is that in this game , everyone has the same chance . " Other players know all too well how addictive the games can be . " It 's all subconscious , " says Bert Romano of Coney Island . " If people put the same $4 or $5 they spend each day on the lottery in a drawer for a year and realized how much they 'd spent , they 'd blow their brains out . " One New Jersey woman embezzled $38,000 from a bank to play the lottery ; an Erie , Pa. , youth was so distraught after gambling $6,000 for a $2.5 million jackpot that he tried to commit suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote gambling , they have a responsibility to take care of the casualties , " says Arnold Wexler , a former $300-a-week lottery player who is now vice president of the National Council on Compulsive Gambling . Yet New Jersey , one of the few states to fund such programs at all , spends less than .0007 percent of its annual gaming revenues on programs to combat compulsive gambling . Lotteries have grown in part because they are a godsend to lawmakers facing dwindling federal revenue sharing and taxpayer rebellions . But critics say the public is deluding itself if it thinks lottery revenues are anything but a shell game . Like other states , New York earmarks lottery revenues for education ? but last week 's burgeoning sales did not increase overall state spending for education ; they merely freed up other funds in the state budget . What 's more , says Notre Dame law Prof. G. Robert Blakey , " if a certain portion of citizens ' dollars are collected in the lottery , it means it did n't get collected in liquor or sales tax . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " Nor have lotteries dented illegal numbers rackets in inner-city areas ? in part because the rackets offer better odds , extend credit and do n't withhold taxes . Bible Belt : For all the raps , lotteries remain popular with the voting public ? to the point that opposition can be hazardous to political health . After vetoing two lottery bills , Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad watched his popularity ratings plummet and was booed at football games before he finally said he would no longer stand in the way . ( Branstad did boycott last week 's opening ceremony , however , and vowed he would never buy a ticket . ) Even in the Bible belt there are signs that longtime fundamentalist opposition to lotteries is grad-  | ually giving way to fiscal necessity and popular demand . " The resistance to gambling is increasingly counterbalanced by the desire not to pay more taxes , " says Emory University history Prof. Dan Carter . Lotteries ? and controversy over them are hardly new to the republic . Lotteries were launched to support Colonial soldiers , build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof under which the first regular U.S. Congress held its sessions . Widespread corruption prompted Congress and states to outlaw them during the19th century ? and ever since New Hampshire began the first modern lottery in 1964 , officials have been preoccupied with trying to keep them aboveboard . It has n't always been easy , what with billions of dollars in contracts , commissions and prize money at stake . The most notorious incident was the Pennsylvania PingPong-ball scandal of 1980 : four people went to jail for fixing the state 's lottery game by injecting latex paint into all the balls except those bearing the numbers four and six , making them pop up most often in the televised drawing . In June the U.S. Postal Service reprimanded Maryland , New Hampshire , Michigan , New York , Rhode ad Island and Massachusetts for violating federal laws by allowing out-of-state gamblers to play by mail . Another chronic problem is attempted forgeries of winning tickets . Last week New York lottery officials were besieged by calls from as far away as England from people falsely claiming they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meanwhile , never do step forward . Last April , after one $5.6 million jackpot had gone unclaimed for a year , Pennsylvania officials simply rolled the money back into the treasury . Coming into the limelight has caused problems for other winners . Last summer the Immigration and Naturalization Service threatened to start deportation proceedings against a Washington , D.C. , lottery winner from Egypt who had violated his student visa . Another winner from Washington turned out to be a deep-cover government agent stationed in Africa on a classified mission . Lottery officials insisted he present his ticket in person , and the State Department was forced to let him come in from the cold to collect his $1 million . Indeed , privacy seems to be the one thing lottery riches ca n't buy . Most winners find themselves harassed by reporters , strangers with sob stories and hucksters hawking everything from Rolls-Royces to investment schemes . " Suddenly I had people coming up to me and saying , Your sister told me you won ' or Your brother told me to look you up ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deloise Singletary , who won $5.5 million in the Maryland lottery last year . Michael Wittkowski , who won $40 million in the Illinois lottery last year , hoped that a single winner would claim the $41 million New York prize so he could lose his title as the largest single jackpot winner ever and become " Mike I ? i ssu ' Kicking off Oregon 's lottery : New gimmicks  | Who ? " Wittkowski 's advice to winners : " Get a good lawyer . " For some winners , of course , the lottery has brought happy endings . Richard Ames , a laid-off coal miner , was running out of unemployment benefits ; his wife , Rose , was n't earning enough in a sewing factory to pay for his cataract surgery and they had told their 10 grandchildren there 'd be no money for Christmas when Rose hit the Maryland $5.8 million jackpot in 1983 . Since then Richard has had his operation and Rose got a Monte Carlo SS , a threebedroom house ? and the peace of mind that her family 's future is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness ? particularly when it 's doled out in extended payments . Raymond Lenox spent the first two installments of his $4.4 million Pennsylvania Lotto prize buying two bars ? and was later convicted on four counts of passing bad checks for furniture and supplies . A pot of gold " can lure you into feeling that you have more money than you do , " says Jana Page , Washington state 's first $1 million winner , who found the pressure so great that she dipped into the drug supply at the convalescent home where she worked . Balloons : State legislators , too , find lottery riches do n't always meet their rising expectations . " No matter how much it generates , it 's not going to be enough , " says Tom Kennedy , Oregon 's director of economic development . Furious that lottery revenues were earmarked for such projects as bringing the Magna Charta to Portland rather than pave roads , rural Oregonians boycotted the start-up of the state 's second game this month ? and symbolically released 40 helium balloons carrying dollar bills to illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring in more and more lottery funds has pushed many lottery officials to push the outside of the technical envelope ? not always with success . Experiments with video lottery terminals ? played like Pac-Man for cash prizes ? in Chicagoarea bars-were ended last spring after they failed to produce expected revenues . Bellevue , Neb. ( population : 30,000 ) , also tried video lotteries ? and was so delighted with its $1.4 million take that town fathers contemplated repealing the property tax . Bowing to complaints that they were little more than one-armed bandits , the state legislature outlawed the machines ? leaving Bellevue officials seething . " They pushed us back into the 18th century , " said city councilman John Deegan . More gimmicks are in the works to keep lottery dollars flowing . New York and Ohio recently set up automatic terminals , where players can buy tickets without the aid of a cashier . Arizona lottery officials dream of someday selling tickets through cable TV ; players would punch in selected numbers ? and receive a bill from the cable company for their purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up the excitement is to create ever-larger jackpots ? a trend that worries some experts , since it means lengthening the odds of winning . " Each state is trying to one-up the other ? all this is going to kill the golden goose , " says Gail Howard , lottery editor of Gambling Times Magazine , who advised her readers to boycott New York Lotto last week . Howard fears that ever-growing odds will discourage regular players and ultimately decrease ticket sales . " The question is ? where does it stop ? " agrees former New Jersey lottery director Hazel Gluck . " No matter how hard you push it , the market will flatten out . " But will it ? Even though losing tickets outnumbered winners 72 million to 3 in New York 's Lotto frenzy , lines for the next round began forming immediately . " It gives you something to look forward to besides coming to work every day , " explained Marla Sperling , 23 . Lyn Cook , who lost $60 in the big drawing , did n't waste time thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $11 more . He said simply , " I figure one day they 'll make a mistake and I 'm gon na win .
