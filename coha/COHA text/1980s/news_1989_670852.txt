People assume he writes in Japanese . He writes in English . They assume that his spare , elliptical style is in the tradition of Japanese poetry . It isn ' t. // " Publicity for me has to a large extent been fighting the urge to be stereotyped by people , " Mr. Ishiguro said the other day . " Some reviews of my first book said , ' You can only tell now and again that it ' s a translation. ' " // Mr. Ishiguro , who is 34 years old , was in New York to promote his third novel , " The Remains of the Day , " ( Alfred A. Knopf ) , which won the Booker Prize on Thursday for the best novel published this year in Britain . Mr. Ishiguro was indeed born in Japan but has not lived there since he was 5 years old . In 1960 , his father , a scientist , moved his family to England for what he thought would be a short stay . Mr. Ishiguro grew up in England attending British schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always expected to return to Japan . He now lives in England with his wife and says he is used to being instantly labeled as different . <> <> The Costs of Restraint // Frustrating as he has found these interminable incorrect assumptions , they ended up influencing " The Remains of the Day , " an alternately funny and heartbreaking account of an English butler who reflects on his life as a gentleman ' s gentleman during a trip through the English countryside in 1956 . Stevens , the butler , has spent a life denying ugly truths and personal ties in the name of dignity and duty . The book explores the emotional and moral costs of a life of restraint and denial , ideals that are championed by both of Mr. Ishiguro ' s cultures , the Japanese and the British. // " The tendency to keep a calm surface , the tendency toward understatement of feeling and emotion , these were qualities that were attributed to my early writing , " Mr. Ishiguro said . " But I wrote my first two books not very conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to me . I wasn ' t trying to write them in an understated way , a Japanese way . It just turned out to be my voice . I couldn ' t help noticing that review after review remarked upon the unusual extent to which it was a language that suppressed emotion , that said things elliptically . For a while I said this is simply a play on my Japanese name , it has nothing to do with you. " // Eventually , however , Mr. Ishiguro said , he was forced to conclude that he did not write the way he did by accident , and he decided to explore those issues in his next book . <> <> Questioning His Approach // " By the time I came to the third book , that was the first time I questioned what are the merits and demerits of this approach to emotion , right down to where does the idea come from that understatement of that sort is elegant or beautiful , even esthetic , " he said. // These questions intersected with a continuing preoccupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-deception and self-justification . In quiet prose , Mr. Ishiguro writes about the illusion of memory , the intrusion of reality and the painful attempt to come to terms with both. // In his first novel , " A Pale View of Hills , " a Japanese woman who has married an Englishman is haunted by her conviction that she is responsible for her daughter ' s suicide . The suicide forces her memories back to the early days of her pregnancy and her disturbing encounter with a woman and her unhappy child in Nagasaki , a city still tormented by the psychological aftershocks of the atomic bombing that led to Japan ' s unconditional surrender. // A Japanese artist who compromised his art by embracing military propaganda is the subject of Mr. Ishiguro ' s second novel , " An Artist of the Floating World . " His cause disgraced , his reputation ruined , the artist rails at the changes that have left him behind . <> <> Relationships and Struggle // Mr. Ishiguro chose a butler as the protagonist for his third novel , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the relationship of ordinary people to power and the struggle to keep emotions and feelings hidden. " // Critics have marveled at how accurately Mr. Ishiguro portrayed Japan , a country he has not known since he was a child , just as they have pressed him on how he could write about a butler when he knew no butlers and about an England that had largely disappeared before Mr. Ishiguro arrived in 1960 . They are both responses that puzzle the writer , who contests another wrong assumption that people make about his work - that novelists must write directly from their own experience. // " I am writing entirely out of my experience ; it ' s just that I don ' t see any reason to be literal about it , " Mr. Ishiguro said . " I don ' t see why I have to write about a guy in his 30 ' s living in England who ' s a writer , and the things that happen to him . These books are autobiographical in the sense that I spend a lot of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I feel the world works . " <> <> Observing From a Corner // The experience of growing up in England as a Japanese , participating in the society but remaining an outsider , also informs his work . " That stance , if you like , of sitting in a corner of the room and looking at everyone else although you ' re part of the room has always come naturally to me , " Mr. Ishiguro said. // Both his Japanese and English friends have told him that neither of his last two novels could have been written by someone who had lived only in England or Japan . A Japanese could not have written of the issues of war guilt with such coolness , nor could an Englishman have written about a butler without touching upon class tensions , an issue Mr. Ishiguro said does not particularly concern him. // He is already thinking about his next novel . In the spirit of bucking stereotypes , he is playing with a very different approach . " What I don ' t want to do is to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I do well , " Mr. Ishiguro said . " I ' d maybe like to write a messy , jagged , loud kind of book . " Advance Publicationsd ( Alfred A. Knopf ) //
