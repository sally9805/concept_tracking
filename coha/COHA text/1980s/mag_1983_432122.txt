I was a little past midnight at the large New York City hospital . A young registered nurse sat behind the desk at the nurses ' station , crying quietly . Her patient , a middleaged woman in Room 6A , had just died , after suffering four strokes in two days . The nurse 's work shift was over , but she had stayed late to finish the paperwork on the case ? and comfort the family of the woman she had tried to save . Although she knew that the hospital staff had done everything they possibly could for the patient , a feeling of helplessness and exhaustion overwhelmed her . As she wiped her eyes , a staff physician , whom we 'll call Dr. Smith , approached the nurses ' station . " Get me Gardner 's chart ! " he ordered the young nurse , even though the chart was right in front of him . No one would have known that just a short while ago the two of them had struggled side by side in the futile effort to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to shout , " Get the chart yourself . I 'm not your servant ! " Instead she swallowed her anger and pretended she had n't heard . Just then the head nurse returned to the desk , and Dr. Smith turned to her , again demanding , " Where 's the chart on Gardner ? " " Right in front of you , doctor , " the head nurse replied evenly . Dr. Smith frowned as he pulled the chart from the rack and walked down the hall . " He 's a cold fish ? ice through and through , " the young nurse said to her superior . " He did n't spend even a few minutes with the family of the woman in 6A ? let alone show any interest in what I might be feeling . He 's the kind of doctor who could make me give up nursing ! " Dr. Smith had turned the corner of the corridor , and then stopped to listen to the nurses ' conversation . He was stung by the strong criticisms because he felt he had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings to a woman colleague who admitted that she too was having trouble with the staff nurses . " Last week , " she said , " I had two prescriptions in my hand and accidentally gave the wrong one to a nurse . She immediately accused me of writing a wrong prescription and practicing bad medicine . " All she had to do was tell me it was wrong ? or ask for the other one ? she did n't have to insult me ! " complained the doctor . Tragically , bitter confrontations between doctors and nurses such as these are all too typical at many hospitals across the country . At Dr.  | Naylor 's hospital , the hostility had grown so intense that patient care had deteriorated . That was why the department chief decided to try an experiment to bring the two sides together ? group therapy sessions . Ten staff members , including the young nurse and Dr. Smith , participated . Therapist Jacques Chammah , M.S.W. , began the session by explaining that he hoped to help them overcome their difficulties in communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly moving experience from childhood . The doctors and nurses took turns sharing an acute emotional moment from their lives . As the hostile co-workers began to see each other as human beings sharing common emotions and experiences ? not just as " doctors " and " nurses " ? Chammah began to draw them out on their work-related problems . He asked each one to pretend he or she was writing a letter to someone in the room , then to speak the letter aloud . The person who received the letter would then speak a response . The young nurse addressed her communication to Dr. Smith . " I admire your skills as a physician , " she said , " but sometimes I feel that when patients get worse or they die , you walk away from them and their families ? and me too ? as if you do not care about any of us . " Dr. Smith answered her : " 1 know you think I am cold , and that hurts me . You see , when a patient dies , I feel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been some way to stop death . I feel you do n't understand the pressure I 'm under . " The members of the group then went on to discuss their problems in detail . Gradually they began to better understand each other 's points of view . The group sessions continued , and even though all grievances did n't disappear overnight , it was n't long before patient care in the department noticeably improved . There are many grievances besides doctors that nurses have in common ? some of these are salaries , which do not adequately reflect nurses ' levels of training or the irregular hours they must work , and paperwork that interferes with the direct patient care nurses really want to give . A nurse knows that the only way she can advance professionally is to leave the  | bedside and become a teacher or administrator . And if she stays on the hospital floor , does it make sense to demand better working conditions when many people ? including doctors ? seem to see nurses as less-than-bright " handmaidens " whose main duty is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession that the war between doctors and nurses has contributed to the shortage of qualified nurses . Nurses accuse doctors of being rude and arrogant more interested in money than in their patients . Doctors they say , wo n't listen to them even when they can offer valuable information about their patients . Doctors accuse nurses of wanting to practice medicine without getting the qualifications to do so . They charge that nurses want the doctors ' power ? but none of the lifeand-death responsibility . The situation resembles a family that is coming apart . And the patient ? like the child in a divorce ? is caught in the middle . The result in many hospitals has been an alarming deterioration of care . Entire wards have been closed , and hospitals have had to turn people away . At times , patients ring for help and a nurse does n't respond . Sometimes , too , potentially dangerous procedures have been delegated to aides and orderlies who are not qualified to perform them . The crisis prompted the American Hospital Association to call for " peace talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed to study the troubled doctor-nurse relationship . Alice Kamm , a Portland . Ore. , nurse , had alwats assumed that the doctor-nurse relationship meant teamwork ? two professionals working side by side . She got her first glimpse of what , in the doctor 's estimation , a nurse 's real place was when she worked in an emergency room . " I was stunned at how the doctors treated me , " Alice recalls . " Ordering me about like a servant . Do this ; do that ; get out of here . ' In front of the patients . " Polly Young , M.D. , a Berkeley , Calif. , family practitioner , relates this story about a former nurse who went back to school to become a doctor . " She told me she would never forget the day ? the very moment ? that she decided to quit nursing and apply to medical school , " Dr. Young says . " She was assisting a doctor in a surgical procedure . Afterward , he ordered her to get him a towel . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skirt . " While many doctors do not deny these stories , they do feel that this kind of demeaning behavior is much less common than it used to be . " I think it 's mostly the older doctors who are the probLem , " says a young internist whom we 'll call Dr. Jones , who practices with the Harvard Community Health Plan in Cambridge , Mass . " They still expect to be treated like gods . When they come on the wards , they do n't even ask for a status report from the nurse who has been with a patient all day long . And if a nurse disagrees with a doctor 's decisions , some simply turn a deaf ear . " When a nurse is not allowed to question , or the information she provides is not taken seriously , there can be tragic consequences . Ginger Dodd , R.N. , a former intensive-care nurse in a San Diego hospital , will never forget the night seven years ago when her patient , a 14-year-old  | boy , died unnecessarily . The youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine appendectomy . When the boy did not respond to the measures the surgeon was taking , the nurses in the unit , including Ginger , all recommended that the surgeon call in an infection specialist . " He accused us of ' overreacting , ' " says Ginger , her hands trembling as she tells the story . The boy died ; soon after . Ginger decided to leave nursing . In its preliminary report , the National Commission on Nursing identified the number-one grievance among nurses as the lack of recognition of their worth . The report also noted that although doctors depend on nurses to take care of their patients , most do not understand what nurses actually do for eight hours every day . " Nurses do many jobs , " says a nurse at a suburban Chicago hospital . " But doctors think we just clean up after our patients , and to a doctor , that is demeaning work . Well , it is important to help patients maintain their dignity , especially in the most undignified situations ? such as when a very sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because we 're saints , but because a person who can maintain human dignity in the face of disease has more of a reason to live . " Cleaning up is hardly all nurses do . At the most basic level , they are responsible for a patient 's total care while in the hospital . This includes administering the drugs and treatments the doctor orders , and coordinating the many services ? from X-rays to inhalation therapy to consultations with social workers ? that a hospitalized patient may require . Many nurses have technical responsibilities , from starting intravenous feedings to operating kidney-dialysis machines . In addition , nurses do all the record-keepingmuch of it documentation required by the hospital to protect itself in the event of a lawsuit . While in training , nurses take some courses identical to those given to medical students . In four-year training programs ( see box , page 172 ) , nurses are trained in pathophysiology ? the disease process . As a result , they are extremely skilled at recognizing signs of disease in their patients , and at noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ? or busy ? doctor . Dr. Polly Young admits that not once in all the years of her medical training did a professor ever discuss how important nursing care is to the recovery of a patient . As far as Dr. Young knew , nurses were there to fetch the charts ,  | roll up the bed , and hand out the pills . Doctors , she assumed , did the real work . Now she feels that " if two people are working on the same patient , and the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing , the care is almost certainly not the most efficient . " B y law , only a doctor may prescribe medication or treatment for a patient . It is the nurse 's job to carry out the orders ? and she 'd better carry -r correctly . Because no matter the orders , the nurse is , e for every drug or treatadministers . Nurses can be , ued for malpractice . As a arses are well versed in the iosages and effects of a multimedications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nurse is instructed that her first duty is to the patient , not the staff . That means she is supposed to question any order that she feels is not in the best interests of the patient . Doctors and nurses have come to near blows over this issue . While everyone can make a mistake , nurses feel caught in some situations . " If a doctor writes an order , " says Alice Kamm , " and you fail to follow it correctly , you 're liable . But if the doctor has prescribed the wrong dosage or the wrong drug , you are expected to know this and if you go ahead and administer it , you 're also liable . Sometimes the nurse is the only one who is blamed , while the doctor goes scot-free . " The suburban Chicago nurse says , " We often know when a doctor has made a mistake , but many doctors behave very aggressively if we challenge them . And when a patient 's private physician is involved , the hospital administration will not back you up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Kansas School of Nursing , explains that there is an economic reason behind a hospital 's reluctance to support a nurse in a dispute with an outside physician . Hospitals need patients ? paying customers ? in order to survive . Outside physicians admit these patients to the hospital . " So , if you confront a physician with his error , " says Professor Dayani , " and you expose him , he can have you fired . " Many doctors deny the charge that they refuse to stand corrected . And in a recent survey , RN magazine reported : " Eighty-one percent of respondents said that doctors do take corrections in a professional manner . " However , " the nurse who comes right out and accuses a doctor of not knowing his business usually gets nowhere , except on the doctor 's bad side . " Nurses admit to having faults of their own ? in particular , a syndrome known as " passive-aggressive behavior . " It is a method nurses have long used to punish physicians who they feel are disre- spectful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of confronting the doctors directly , which they often feel powerless to do , they slow down , pretend not to hear orders , or insist on going strictly by the rules . " It 's unfortunate to have to resort to subterfuge , " says Dr. Polly Young , " but it is really an expression of nurses ' powerlessness because they are not being dealt with as adult professionals . " If a nurse wishes to make life difficult for a doctor , or a doctor wants to make a nurse uncomfortable , that 's easy . Working out the differences is harder ? but there are encouraging signs that things are changing for the better . A new breed of nurse , the clinicalnurse specialist , is being trained in various specialties , taking some courses side by side with doctors . And , in its preliminary report , the National Commission on Nursing recommended that hospitals set up official joint practices between doctors and nurses . In this setup , doctors and nurses work together from the moment the patient is admitted to the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nurses should be included in the clinical decision-making process , " the report stated . It also warned doctors that it was their responsibility to promote the respect and recognition of nurses among their colleagues . Joint-practice pilot programs have been highly successful in hospitals in California , Maine , Oklahoma , and New York . The system is monitored by joint-practice committees . " We have resolved an awful lot of things in the joint-practice committee , " comments one of the doctors in the program . " We even have more arguing , but that 's good . . . . some physicians would n't have bothered to get into arguments with nurses before . " Arguments erupt between equals . As equals , nurses in joint-practice units take on more responsibility ? causing some doctors to worry about " nurses practicing medicine . " Experience has proven their fears groundless . Dr. Jones , the Cambridge , Mass. , internist , works with nurse practitioners who perform physical examinations unless the patient specifically requests a doctor . " The nurses do n't proceed beyond what they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has already been adopted into the hospital system is " primary nursing . " Instead of a patient 's having one physician and many nurses , she is attended by one physician and one nurse . The primary nurse becomes responsible for all nursing care to just a few patients at a time , instead of covering many patients . Primary nursing is increasingly appreciat-. ed in cancer units , where one-on-one nursing can supply a more thoroughgoing care , including emotional understanding , home-care planning , and family and bereavement counseling . Life in a hospital will never resemble TV 's General Hospital , where the only trouble doctors and nurses ever seem to have is with their personal relationships . But today 's real-life nurses do not want that kind of peace . They want involvement . Lately they have been staking out new territory for themselves by enrolling in " high tech " specialty programs . Now it 's frequently the nurse who knows more than the doctor about operating and interpreting complicated and futuristic machinery . Medical technology has already grown too complex for doctors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary nursing , clinical-nurse specialists ? all suggest an encouraging future in which staff and patients alike will benefit . Doctors do not know everything . Nurses do not know everything . Nobody knows everything . But when doctors and nurses work in harmony , they can deliver better health care than ever before possible . " It 's as though the medical profession has been looking through just one eye at a time , " says nurse Alice Kamm " Open both eyes ? and it 's amazing how much more you can see . "
