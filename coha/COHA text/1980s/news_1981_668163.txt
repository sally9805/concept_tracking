As I write this , there is snow on the ground and in the weather forecast , grins on the lips of skiers , and smiles on the faces of ski area operators . It is too early tell whether or not New England will have a really good ski season , but at least it will be a season - something which couldn ' t be said of last year . Christmas week traditionally gets the ski season rolling and the juices of skiers running . Thanks to an early snow storm , tradition was joyfully observed at most New England ski areas . Northern New England ski resorts reported lift ticket sales running normally over the holidays - and some even reported records . At Yuletide in 1979 , you will recall it was practically possible to pick daisies on the slopes in what was supposed to be Snow Country . In recent years , all major - and many minor - ski areas have beefed up their snow-making equipment and thanks to the recent cold snap most have been able to supplement natural snow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , areas like Mount Tom and Brodie Mountain in the Berkshires had as much as two-feet of mostly artificial snow on some trails . " Nobody has all their trails open yet - but everybody was so gun shy after last year there is considerable relief , " said Mill Moore , a spokesman for the New England Ski Area Council . Because last season was a meteorological bummer and a financial disaster and money is tight and high priced at the moment , only a few New England ski areas have done much in the way of major expansion or improvement . Among the exceptions , however , is Cannon Mountain - the old neighbor of the Old Man of the Mountain - has replaced its venerable , 42-year-old tramway with a new 80-passenger model at a cost of over $4 million . Loon has added a $450,000 double chair lift - its fifth - and improved snow making and parcing . Bousquet , in the Berkshires , has added a triple chairlift . Both Sugarbush and Stratton-Bromley ( the two areas merged in 1979 ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile . Stratton has invested about $l million in improvements in the last year , but virtually all of that went for condominium construction and access road improvement rather than onto the slopes . Until New England gets at least one normal ski season behind it , Moore noted , " You just aren ' t going to see any huge changes . " Grateful just to have a place to ski , most skiers are not really clamoring for growth and novelty - although the cost of the status quo continues to climb . A weekend day ticket at Stratton , for instance is now $20 - up $2 from last season and highest in the nation . Other top areas are not far behind : Sugarbush charges $l9 for an adult day ticket - a hike of $3 . In Vail , Colo. you can get a day ticket and Rocky Mountain powder for $l8 . But , as local ski operators are quick to point out , Colorado is a long and pricey plane ride away . And , this year , while we have been getting sub-zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing for snow conditions . High prices are an unavoidable fact of New England ski life these days but they become more manageable in package form - particularly mid-week packages . For approximately $225 per person , double occupancy , it ' s still possible to get a five day package that includes motel-type accommodations , breakfast and dinner , and lift tickets . By contrast , a typical two-day weekend package - using accommodation withing five miles of a major ski area - would probably cost an average of about $120 per person . Priced in between the week and the weekend package , and a popular compromise is the three-day weekend . Three day weekend packages , some offerning three meals a day , can be had for around $100 per person . For a lot of skiers these days the modern version of the old fashioned ski house is the condominium , which while it usually costs a lot more than a re- modeled barn as a rule offers superior amenities and considerable convenience - such as being only a short ski from the lifts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slopes can be rented for five days for $238 per person , double occupancy . Condos have full kitchens , but in resort developments have the additional advantage of being only a few minutes away from restaurants and local apres ski activity . There are even a few bargains to be had on the slopes this season . If you have any old Canadian money hanging around your wallet , you might consider taking it to Jay Peak , Vt . Jay , which draws a lot of its skiers from Montreal , is accepting Canadian dollars at par with the US variety . Since the Canadiandollar is officially worth less than 85 US cents , this amounts to a 15 percent bonus . Attitash , N.H. , which does not have snow-making equipment , was virtually wiped out last season . As a gesture of appreciation to those loyal and optimistic skiers who bought season passes , but often didn ' t even get the bottoms of their skis wet , Attish is offering holders of last year ' s season passes a 90 percent discount on this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators of ski touring centers the winter of 1979-80 was a disaster in northern New England , most of which didn ' t see a substantial snowfall until March ; and a catastrophe in the southern part of the region - which saw virtually no snow at all . About all the up-country centers are open and operating nearly normally and most touring centers around the region have had at least some skiing this season - in contrast to last year . More snow would certainly help the touring centers by making all trails skiable and reviving public enthusiasm . The sport is still growing , but the rate of growth has been slowed by poor skiing conditions . The lackluster performance of US nordic skiers at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics and President Carter ' s recent mishap on the touring trail haven ' t helped much , either . Ski tourers are a determined lot and manage to ski not only where ever there is snow but whenever as well . Many touring centers have become extremely skilled at " snow farming , " which means making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Weston Ski Track , for example , has offered skiing for a month - missing only a couple of days - by plowing snow off the MDC golf course where it ' s located and onto the touring track . Last season , one of the few places to offer all-winter cross country skiing was the Jackson Ski Touring Foundation in Jackson , N.H. " We kept a l.2 kilometer trail open all season by hand shoveling snow onto it , " said foundation executive director Thom Perkins , " it cost us 80 cents a foot - but we have a commitment to skiing . " The Jackson Foundation was in far better shape last week than at the same time last year with a good base and six kilometers of tracked trail open . The foundation is part of the Ski the White Mountain Assn. which offers a five-day reciprocal pass for $16 ( $8 for children under 12 ) good at five New Hampshire and Maine areas : Jackson , Waterville Valley , Bretton Woods , Balsams- Wilderness , Bethel Inn , and Sunday River . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free sport and a good form of exercise for healthy older persons . To encourage Americans over 50 to get out on the touring trails the US Ski Assn. , the Ski Touring Council , the National Ski Operators Assn. and other skiing organizations , with funding from Travelers Insurance , are sponsoring a series of Senior Pep League clinics to teach cross country to senior citizens and other middle age plus would-be skiers .
