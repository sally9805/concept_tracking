The President sends U.S. military forces into an area where they come under enemy fire . Congressmen denounce him for dragging the nation into battle " unconstitutionally . " But it is too late ; war has begun , and Congress has no choice except to let it continue . <P> A description of how the U.S. got into war in Viet Nam in 1965 ? Or how it might become embroiled in the Persian Gulf conflict the day after tomorrow ? Not quite : this war began in 1846 , when President James K. Polk sent troops to occupy a disputed border area between Mexico and the new state of Texas , touching off fighting that Congress reluctantly formalized with a declaration of war . Otherwise , though , Polk 's action might have been a dress rehearsal for the bloody undeclared wars the U.S. has fought in the past four decades . It illustrates a conflict between congressional and presidential powers that is built into the Constitution . <P> The framers , determined never to give one man the authority of the European kings of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole power to declare war . But they recognized that unity of command was essential , and so made the President Commander in Chief , thus giving him at least potential authority to order troops into situations where war might become inevitable . As early as 1801 , Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton were disputing the division of power . President Jefferson told Congress that without a declaration of war , he could order only defensive action , even against enemy attack . No , said Hamilton , an attack on U.S. forces creates a state of war and makes " any declaration on the part of Congress . . . unnecessary . " <P> Later Presidents took a far less restrictive view of their authority than Jefferson did . Congress has declared war only five times , embroiling the U.S. in the War of 1812 , the Mexican War , the Spanish-American War and World Wars I and II . Even in the 19th century , declared wars were far outnumbered by military actions begun at a President 's command . <P> When Chief Executives involved the nation in serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their actions , usually after the fact . And when Presidents did get the U.S. into wars that had the potential of being unpopular , no constitutional crisis occurred because the U.S. always won . <P> After World War II , however , conflicts over warmaking authority could no longer be suppressed . The U.S. emerged as a global superpower , committed to the defense of allies against another superpower , the Soviet Union , and its clients . The chances of shooting incidents multiplied greatly . The terrible power of modern weapons increased the premium on fast action , which could not wait for an old-fashioned declaration of war . The threat of nuclear holocaust dictated the need to limit whatever wars did start . That also worked against declarations of war and simultaneously made difficult , if not impossible , a clean-cut victory .
