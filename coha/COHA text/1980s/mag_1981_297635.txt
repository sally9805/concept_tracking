Hunting for the hitmen <P> The initial but unconfirmed reports that a Libyan hit squad had been dispatched to the U.S. by Muammar Gaddafi to assassinate President Reagan and other high federal officials took a more ominous turn last week . Intelligence officials grilling an informant about the plot are now impressed by the amount of detail he provided about the training and equipping of Libyan assassination teams . The informant claimed that five Libyan hitmen had already entered the U.S. <P> While corroboration of the informant 's disclosures has not yet been established , FBI , Secret Service and CIA agents questioning him were worried enough to urge a nationwide search for the would-be assassins . The plotters were reportedly working on a number of options , including firing a surface-to-air missile at the President 's plane , Air Force One ; shooting rockets at his limousine ; and attacking him with handguns .

" Said he : " There is no such hit team working under orders from the Libyan government . " <P> Beyond the man hunt , which involved FBI and Secret Service interviews with many Americans who may have had recent links with Libya , security precautions continued to be tightened around the President , Vice President George Bush , Secretary of State Alexander Haig and members of the Reagan family . In addition , Secret Service protection was extended for the first time to the President 's top aides , James Baker , Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese . White House officials , however , were understood to be extremely concerned about disclosures of specific security addafi measures . <P> One U.S. intelligence official summed up the situation as " a very serious threat . " Said a high law-enforcement officer about the terrorists : " They want to make a sensation . If they ca n't get the President , they are apparently under instructions to kill anyone close to him . " Said Reagan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the record , you ca n't dismiss them out of hand . " Nevertheless , the President added , " they 're not going to change my life much .
