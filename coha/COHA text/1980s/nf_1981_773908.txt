Some users could browse through vast quantities of information or instruct the machines to search for the data they need . Time-sharing services , in which many users could share one machine by telecommunications , developed . When computer networks developed , a user had access to not one machine , but large numbers of machines in different parts of the country connected by a data network . In the 1970s microcomputers developed , so that time-shared links were no longer needed to do most calculations . These could be done on a pocket calculator or a small local machine . Telecommunications links to computers were needed to provide information or perform activities not possible on the small local machines . In many of its applications the computer has become a new communications medium , providing information and carrying out a dialogue with its users . As this capability improves , vast networks interlinking many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the answers to his or her requests are coming from as computers flash messages around the network to obtain the required data or services . In our society the production of services is much less highly developed than the production of manufactured goods . Many professionals of great skill pool their talents to create the production lines that turn out cars or television sets . This combining of skills to mass-produce goods has resulted both in much more elaborate and better products than would otherwise have been possible and at much lower prices . In contrast , many services involve the skill of only one person ? a physician , a news reporter , a repairperson , or a teacher . An amazing quantity of different knowledge and skill goes into the production of a jet aircraft . Computer networks will eventually make possible services that incorporate a similarly vast quantity of different people 's knowledge and skill . Services will be in short supply as long as they are in the artisan stage , but computer networks can mass-produce information resources of the highest quality , making them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ householders . A network for teaching will have far more skill built into it as a jet aircraft now has . Computers act as a storage battery for human intellect , and data networks provide the means of distributing the resource . As time goes by , more and more human intellect will be stored in the machines . It will become unnecessary , for example , to do many forms of mathematics by hind ; a machine can integrate , differentiate , and solve the // most complex equations . Mathematicians will go on to more creative pursuits , and as they do so the machines will become still more capable . Computer networks will take over the routine work of doctors , generals , architects , and scientists , providing them with better information and allowing them to concentrate on the more creative or human parts of their jobs . In research laboratories a variety of disciplines classed as " artificial intelligence " are steadily developing . Various types of intelligent behavior will be built into the computers and networks to assist users in finding information they want or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and more capability to manipulate it . The word " symbiosis " is being used in a new way in connection with computers . " Symbiosis " is generally defined as the coexistence in intimate association or close union of two dissimilar organisms . In the new use of the word , one of the " organisms " becomes a computer with its associated equipment . People communicate with the machine by means of whatever " terminal " device gives them the closest relationship . This might be a machine with a screen , possibly a domestic television , on which the computer flashes diagrams , text , equations , or numbers . People give the machine information with a keyboard or with a " light pen , " with which they can , in effect , draw on the face of the screen or in other ways indicate their wishes to the computer . The potential of human intelligence combined with the best capabilities of computer networks will take decades to understand fully , let alone exploit , but of all technological advances it may be that combination which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an age when intelligent people in all walks of life will need and constantly use their computer terminals ; this will be a symbiotic age when the limited human brain is supplemented by the vast data banks and logic power of distant machines . Probably all the professions will have their own data banks and possibly their own languages . The nonprofessional will use home terminals for education , working out tax returns , computer dating , planning vacations , and just for sheer entertainment . Before long this technology will reach a critical point in growth when it achieves mass acceptance and masses of people will contribute . Vast numbers of computer hobbyists will have access to vast networks of program and data libraries . The systems will grow , multiply , and interlink . A worldwide network of computers will be available to us . We will find enthusiastic users in many fields adding programs and data to files for public use . Dedicated amateurs are increasingly writing programs and collecting royalties on them . The most popular programs will earn massive royalties more than best-selling hooks do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow vast , like libraries of books and literature . Mass participation in programming will cause an ever-growing chain reaction . Computer-assisted instruction will employ thousands of talented teachers with professional technical assistance . And this is equally true in other fields . Technology is bringing the computer to the general public . People everywhere will be able to participate in using and building up an enormous quantity of computerized information and logic . To an increasing extent the computers themselves will be used to create programs , automating the development process . Already , many applications are being created without programming . The reader might consider the technical progress that humankind has made in the last hundred years and reflect on the accomplishments of the next hundred years , with hundreds of millions of people adding to the noosphere and linking millions of computers , which are growing explosively in power and intelligence . As mentioned in Chapter 4 , dialogue between a terminal and a computer does not generally need continuous transmission as in a telephone conversation . Instead , bursts of data pass backward and forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmits at a reasonably high bit rate , the bursts will be brief . In a typical dialogue with a computer the bursts range from a few bits to several thousand bits each . The pauses between transmissions from an operator are often half a minute or so , whereas the burst is transmitted in a small fraction of a second . The reader might think of a data network as being rather like a railroad network with engines running on it carrying bursts of data . The switches must be designed to switch the tracks fast for individual engines . Engines from many different sources and going to many different locations will be intermingled on the tracks . Many of the physical transmission links that form part of the telephone system operate at 1.544 million bits per second , and the network might be built from these links . A typical burst of data would traverse such a link in less than one thousandth of a second , and the switching would take place at about that speed . This may be contrasted with telephone switching , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so while they talk . If the gap between the bursts of data from one person operating a terminal is twenty seconds , it will he seen that the transmissions from thousands of persons can be interleaved . Such a network will provide a very low cost per user if thousands of users share it . The bursts of data are sometimes referred to as " packets , " and one technique of switching the tracks for each arriving packet is called " packet switching . " Packet-switching networks have been built in many countries but do not yet use the fastest digital circuits ( many millions of bits per second ) . Several extensions to packet-switching networks have been demonstrated ; these include packet radio , with which data can be sent and received by radio devices , including portable terminals , which could be built as small as pocket calculators . Packet-switching networks have also sent packets via communications satellites . Sometimes , it is necessary to send long messages over packetswitching networks . These may be sent as strings of packets which are reassembled after transmission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaply will become very widespread in some countries during the next ten years . After a decade of pioneering in packet switching , the years ahead will be a period of mass production , with data networks growing rapidly until they reach all major towns in many countries and are interlinked worldwide . In the future it may become possible to connect a packet device to any telephone extension . There are now several inexpensive devices on the market that could act as cheap terminals to send and receive packets . One massive application for such devices is for machines that deal with monetary transactions in stores and restaurants . These are discussed in Chapter 10 . It is possible that the home television set may become the most common interface to the data networks as viewdata systems drop in cost . The networks will grow and interlink worldwide . They will use much-higher-capacity transmission links , such as satellite circuits and the AT &T; trunks , which transmit 274 million bits per second . The information and programs will be provided by thousands of entrepreneurs everywhere , ranging from ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers will assist the public to find what they want , and many highly specialized resources will be made available to users everywhere . Money is merely information , and as such can reside in computer storage with payments consisting of data transfers between one machine and another . // One of the most intriguing new uses of telecommunications will change the way we make monetary payments . Today most major money transfers are in the form of paper ? bills , checks , or the paperwork associated with a credit card transaction . The new method is called electronic funds transfer ( EFT ) . Thomas J. Watson , Jr. , the president of IBM , foresaw the revolution in money in 1965 as follows : In our lifetime we may see electronic transactions virtually eliminate the need for cash . Giant computers in banks , with massive memories , will contain individual customer accounts . To draw from or add to his balance , the customer in a store , office , or filling station will do two things : insert an identification into the terminal located there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantaneously , the amount he punches out will move out of his account and enter another . Consider this same process repeated thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions of times each day ; billions upon billions of dollars changing hands without the use of one pen , one piece of paper , one check , or one green dollar bill . Finally , consider the extension of such a network of terminals and memories ? an extension across city and state lines , spanning our whole country . The money is in the form of bits passing unseen between one machine and another . Electronic money can be transmitted over a telephone line , relayed via satellite , delivered to a computer on a magnetic tape , or transferred in any other way computers handle information . Needless to say , such systems must he designed with a high level of security so that the invisible money can not he accidentally lost or changed if // machines break down or errors occur in transmission . The money must be protected from ingenious new forms of electronic embezzlement . Bankers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when a major EFT crime does occur it could be massive , because vast sums are transferred between banks . The sums are so large that one or two transactions could disrupt the economy of a small country . Over the next ten , years the nature of the payments mechanism in some countries will swing from being predominantly paper-oriented to being electronic , at least in part , with vast quantities of financial transactions traveling over data networks . Some large banks are now planning private networks with tens of thousands of terminals . There are more than a thousand banks in the United States , and eventually they will be interlinked into nationwide networks for transferring money electronically . Many institutions other than banks handle money , hold deposits , and offer credit ; the financial data networks affect all such institutions and present sudden new opportunities that will generate fierce competition in the money-handling business . Eventually , many millions of transactions per day will be passing over the financial networks . Before societies used money , trade was carried out by means of barter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities became standards of value against which all others were measured . In early societies these commodities had intrinsic usable value , such as wheat , cattle , or wives . Later , gold became a standard . Gold was rare , divisible , unattacked by rust and lichen , and beautiful enough to inspire poets . For millennia it has been the world 's standard of value ? fought over , traded , ornamented , stolen , and worshipped . Only in recent years have we gathered the effrontery to question the necessity of its role . Paper money was invented in 1694 , and at first it was regarded by many as a sinister banker 's trick . Until this century paper money seemed respectable only if it was backed by an equivalent amount of gold in some banker 's vault . Today , the currency note is no longer convertible into gold . Currency bills used to say that a central bank " promised to pay the bearer on demand " in gold the value represented by the bill . Today we merely say " In God We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into common use by the average person , replacing the need to pay with currency . In the late 1960s check and currency usage began to give way to credit cards , removing the payments still further from hacking by gold or conl76 Invisible Money Chap . 10 modities . Today , what may be the ultimate payments mechanism ? electronic bits flowing between computers ? is gaining momentum . EFT recognizes that money is merely a form of information . The dollar bills that pass from pocket to pocket have become merely a demonstration of one 's ability to pay . If money is information , then that information can reside in computer storage and payments can consist of data transfers between one machine and another . EFT enthusiasts began to talk of a cashless , checkless society . In reality , society will be neither cashless nor checkless for the foreseeable future . Rather , what has worried bankers is that the amount of paperwork associated with checks and credit cards is growing by leaps and bounds . One hundred million checks a day are written in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double in the next ten years . While checks are expensive because of the paperwork costs , credit card transactions are even more so ; their cost is over $0.50 per transaction and rising . Electronic funds transfer offers a way to slow , and later reverse , the growth of paperwork . The replacements of gold by paper money and of paper money by checks were each revolutionary in their day . Now we must become used to financial transfers occurring in the form of electronic pulses on a data link . The paperwork associated with the transaction will now merely inform us about the transaction , rather than represent the transaction itself . It will not have to be keyed into a computer . The eventual consequences of the simple idea of automatic credit transfer will be enormous . Vast random-access computer files in banks will hold full details of all accounts . As a transaction is entered into the system , transmitted data will cause the appropriate amount to be deducted from an account in one computer and added to an account in another . Eventually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with data links carrying information between them.There are four main types of electronic funds transfer representing successive steps toward an EFT society . The first involves transfers of money between banks , to carry out clearing operations . Second , there are transfers between the computers of other organizations and the bank computers . A corporation may pay its salaries , for example , by giving a tape or transmitting salary information to a bank clearing center , which distributes the money to the appropriate accounts . Third , the general public use terminals to obtain banking services . These terminals include cash-dispensing machines in the streets . There are a variety of such terminals with different functions . To operate // the terminals , customers are equipped with machine-readable bank cards . In the fourth and ultimate phase of electronic funds transfer , consumers pay for goods and services in restaurants and stores by using their bank cards or similar cards provided by American Express , large retail chains , petroleum companies , and other organizations . Today 's credit card devices ( which create paperwork ) will be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large numbers of such machines are already in use . " EFT " thus refers to a wide variety of different computer systems , but in general the term has become synonymous with advanced new technical directions in banking . Present techniques for making payments require much human labor . Credit cards have increased , not decreased , the quantity of paperwork and manual operations . Labor costs are rising , and it is becoming more difficult to obtain workers for dull , boring , but high-accuracy tasks . It has been estimated that the credit card cost of over $0.50 per transaction could be lowered to $0.07 by the use of equiva-lent EFT transactions . Electronic funds transfer can make cash available to bankers faster , and time is money , especially with today 's interest rates . About 30 billion checks per year are written in the United States , representing $20 trillion per year . An electronic funds transfer network could speed up the average clearing time for checks by at least one day and probably more . One day represents a float of savable by electronic check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $4.38 billion . Often several days ' float will be saved . The number of credit card transactions is also high , and instantaneous handling could again give a massive potential saving to the credit card companies . The total transmission capacity needed is very low compared to today 's usage of telephone circuits and satellites . A typical transaction can be sent in less than 500 bits . A bank clearing house takes checks drawn against many banks and allocates the funds appropriately . The automated clearing house movement in the banking industry is an attempt to create and electronic infrastructure that can reduce the labor in check clearing . This will both lower the cost of ' check clearing and speed it up . It will also enable banks to offer new services to their customers . For example , computers in some // corporations deliver the payroll in electronic form to a clearing house , and from there the money is moved into the banks where the employees have accounts . There is then no need to print and read payroll checks . In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these centers a telecommunications network operates , transmitting many millions of transactions per day . The National Automated Clearing House Association coordinates the development of the clearing house facilities , which must remain neutral to the competitive banking industry . The automated clearing houses and their network will have a vital role to play as EFT systems spread to the consumer level . Many of the payments that are made by check are repetitive payments , the same sum being paid at regular intervals , or at least a sum that can be calculated well in advance . Such payments include rents , mortgages , local taxes , society dues , and interest payments . Much work can be saved if these payments are made by preauthorization ( the term standing order is used in British parlance ) . Once an instruction to make the payment repetitively is given to a bank computer , the payment is made without further paperwork . The U.S. government handles some military payroll and many social security payments in this way . Some labor unions have discussed having workers paid daily by electronic means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house or by a suitably prepared bank . Many bank customers would welcome a bank service that pays their rent , mortgages , society dues , and so on , without involving them in further paperwork . The situation is slightly more complicated if the payments vary each time they are made . Dividends , like wages , can be paid automatically into customer accounts , and most customers , once they are used to it , welcome rather than resist this form of computer-to-computer payment . In a similar way , telephone companies and other utilities could send their bills directly to the bank clearing system . This , however , is a much more drastic step , because money is being taken from the accounts of individuals rather than being added to them . Many consumers feel that they should have the option of not paying their telephone bills ! Nevertheless , the majority would probably welcome an automatic bill-paying service . If preauthorized payments of these types were fully used , the total volume in the United States would exceed 5 billion transactions per year . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what transactions had been made . The paperChap. // work would be statements about the transactions , not the transactions themselves . There would be no writing or processing of checks , no rooms of keyboard operators laboriously and sometimes erroneously entering details of transactions . If money is deducted from customer accounts by electronic funds transfer , some of these accounts are likely to go into the red periodically . The consumers do not have quite the same control as when they can add up every payment they make with their checkbooks ( although few today do so ) . An essential aspect of EFT , therefore , is the ability for customers to have negative balances in their banks . The magnitude of the permissible negative balance would be set by a bank officer ( or possibly by computers ) . The customer would be automatically charged interest on a negative balance . There are various forms of automatic negative balance in operation today . Automated credit offers a constant temptation to overdraw . This might have great appeal to banks , which would make money on the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resent losing the time delay on the transactions or losing their ease of refusing to pay . A wide variety of incentives have been devised for making EFT appealing to customers ; these include discounts , cash-dispensing terminals in corporate offices , EFT terminals in corporate cafeterias , lower bank charges , and general ease of obtaining money . Systems for transferring funds between banks electronically are coming into operation not only on a national scale but also internationally . The first major international network is the SWIFT system . SWIFT , the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Transactions , is a non-profit-making organization set up and wholly owned by banks in Europe , Canada , and the United States . SWIFT operates a worldwide network , the purpose of which is to send money , messages , and bank statements at high speed between banks . The participating banks financed the system , and a tariff structure charges for its use on a per message basis plus a fixed connection charge and an annual charge based on traffic volumes . The banks range from very small ones to hanks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions per day between hanks . In the mid-1970s a new wave of banking automation swept across America , triggered by the advent of machine-readable bank cards . These plastic cards have the size and appearance of a credit card , but unlike conventional credit cards they carry invisible data that can be read by a terminal . Previously , such cards carried data encoded on two magnetic strips . Now a third magnetic strip is used on which data can be written by the terminal as well as read . There are some exceptions to the magnetic-strip technology , notably New York 's Citibank cards , which contain a strip read with ultraviolet light . Using a bank card at an appropriate terminal , bank customers can inquire about the status of their accounts . They can deposit or withdraw cash , borrow money if it is not in their accounts , or transfer money between different types of accounts . In fact , they can do virtually everything that they would previously have done by going to a branch of the bank , standing in a queue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a bank 's customers used bank cards and terminals , would the bank need tellers ? Its operations could be designed so that it needed only officers , who deal with situations needing human interaction and decisions . A bank could close some of its branches in expensive city streets and yet give its customers more convenient service , because the automated teller terminals are becoming located in stores , shopping plazas , airports , factory cafeterias , and office buildings . Furthermore , the customers could obtain cash or other banking services when the bank was closed . Many people in New York now completely rely on automated banking , which allows them to obtain cash whenever they need it . Some customers have an initial hostility to banking by machine , but once used to its convenience , few want to go back to queuing in marble-pillared branches . The prospect of doing away with the bank teller is revolutionary enough , but another implication of automated teller terminals threatens to play havoc with the entire structure of banking . Banking in the United States has traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank may have its branches . In 1974 , the Comptroller of the Currency , who regulates banking activity , made the ruling that a remote terminal which customers use does not constitute a bank " branch . " Following this ruling , banks rapidly started to spread their tentacles into geographic areas from which they had earlier been excluded . The controversial ruling was then challenged in the courts , but now it seems certain that the structure of American banking will change fundamentally . // A landmark court case ruled that the bank terminals in tie Hinky Dinky supermarkets in Nebraska were legal and did not constitute branches . In a Nebraska supermarket an individual can elect to pay for $25 of groceries by switching the $25 from a savings account to his or her account with the supermarket . The transaction is completed without the use of currency or checks . Automated teller terminals can be operated by organizations other than banks . Several savings and loan associations operate them . Consumer finance companies , large chain stores , gasoline companies , credit unions , and other organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of these operate credit-checking terminals , and some have applied for permission to hold customers ' balances , in which case their terminals could have most of the functions of a banking terminal . The banks , in other words , could face electronic competition from a variety of other organizations . The 1974 ruling that a banking terminal was not a branch opened up the possibility of large banks developing nationwide terminal networks . Bank customers who have become used to electronic banking certainly want to have its facilities nationwide . A New Yorker wants to be able to use a New York bank card across the river in New Jersey and across the country in California . The customer not only wants to be able to use the card in stores and restaurants but also wants to be able to obtain cash from cash-dispensing terminals . Nationwide networks for checking a customer 's credit already exist . Nationwide networks for transferring consumer funds and accepting the bank cards will be built . Hooking together many local systems of banking terminals is a problem not unlike hooking together many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be national standards for the terminals that are used . A nationwide network may develop to serve many different banks . A small-town bank , like an American small-town telephone company , will be able to say to its customers : " We can hook you into the world . " The simplest customer-activated terminal is the telephone . Some banks offer services that enable customers to make payments by telephone . There have been experiments in which some banks have attempted to automate banking from the home by using a pushbutton telephone and computer which responds with spoken words . One of the costliest operations in the use of computers is the preparation or keyboard entry of data . To reduce costs it is desirable // to persuade customers to enter transactions themselves in an electronic form . This can be done at customer-activated terminals in banks or in the street . It could also very conveniently be done from the home on a seven-day , almost twenty-four-hour basis . Paying one 's bills at home with a pushbutton telephone could be very convenient and appealing to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient method of accessing bank records and making transactions . The system needs to have good security controls . The home or personal terminal can have a unique number wired into it which it transmits so that it is identifiable . Some American banking authorities believe that banking from the home will become commonplace . Catalog or mail-order shipping could be done from the home telephone , using EFT . This is done today without EFT by one large store in Canada , using a computer system that speaks responses . Television selling may enable viewers to purchase goods and pay for them using a keyboard . It will form a particularly powerful means of advertising because customers can be instructed to take action immediately on the keyboard linked to the television set . Electronic banking greatly reduces paperwork . It is one further aspect of the move to a paperless society . In the home of the future people will be able to display their bank statements and transactions , perhaps on viewdata-like screens . They will be able to make payments and balance their checkbooks on the same facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the payments made by consumers in large stores and restaurants are entered directly into the banking systems instead of being made by credit cards or checks . The rapidly spreading bank cards are the vehicles for such transactions , and consumers have demonstrated in a few early systems that they like the convenience of paying with bank cards . The term applied to extension of financial services to large stores and restaurants is point-of-sale systems . Eventually , there are likely to be 50 billion electronic point-of-sale transactions made per year in the United States . Much of the initial use of point-of-sale terminals is not for funds transfer , but for checking the consumer 's bank balance so that checks can be cashed . The cost of networks needed for point-of-sale funds transfers and similar uses are , as elsewhere in telecommunications , highly sensitive to traffic volume . If there are few transactions , the cost per transaction will be high : if there are many transactions , the cost per transaction will be low . The initial systems may therefore he difficult to cost-justify , but once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly economical and will probably spread very rapidly , as did the use of credit cards . One essential to the future of point-of-sale EFT is the availability of mass-produced , inexpensive terminals . Some terminals now in use are simple and low in cost . It is interesting to reflect that a bill-paying terminal for the home could be very inexpensive . Such a terminal could identify itself to the bank computer and have no need for a bank-card reader ? only for a keyboard that sends signals like a pushbutton telephone . Manufactured in quantity , such terminals could cost as little as pocket calculators . Because of the volume sensitivity , point-of-sale linkage to banks is coming either from the very large banks or from corporative bank card groups . In many cases , however , it is not the commercial banks that are providing point-of-sale terminals . The banks face potential competition in this area from credit card companies , savings and loan associations , finance companies , and particularly from the large stores themselves . Large stores see point-of-sale terminals as carrying out functions other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and sales analysis , tighter credit control , improved cash flow , shorter checkout time , and hence less checkout staff . A factor that will make the area highly competitive in some countries is what organizations handle the sums of money , gigantic in total , that consumers deposit and that are extended as consumer credit . The battle for these funds , each running into hundreds of billions of dollars , will be fierce and is very much related to what credit cards or banks consumers use . Eventually , a high proportion of society 's payments will be made with machine-readable cards . If appropriate security procedures are built into the systems , a criminal would be able to gain nothing by stealing a bank card . They could be made much safer than today 's credit cards ( and in some systems have been ) . One of the subsidiary benefits of an EFT society could be a great reduction in street robberies because pedestrians would no longer carry much money or credit cards . Major costs are loaded onto today 's economy from robbery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of insurance , the reluctance of big-city police to investigate minor robberies , the fear of walking on city streets after dark , the inability to obtain some types of insurance . ( Insurance is impossible to obtain on many welfare check payments due to the risk , for example . ) Electronic payments systems with tight security controls could do much to lessen this burden of crime . The EFT networks themselves offer new opportunities for inge84 Invisible Money Chap . 10 nious computer crime , and tight security controls need to be built into the systems . The only way to make the transmissions safe from wiretapping is to use cryptography , just as intelligence agencies send coded messages that can not be deciphered . The technology does exist for making EFT networks sufficiently secure , although on some systems it may not be used adequately . Successful crime in a computerized society will probably require , like other activities , longer training and a higher IQ . A cause of concern with electronic funds transfer , as in other advanced uses of teleprocessing , is that individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be laid bare to government authorities . Some doctors rebelled against using on-line services for billing patients , presumably because they revealed too much to the IRS . The on-line terminal services , accepted with delight by some , are regarded with distrust by others . There is still a fear , if not always consciously stated , that the remote machine will lose information , make mistakes , or print out one 's financial details for other people to see . However , the computers can be made trustworthy , superbly accurate , and secure . The computer files can be made private , but it will take time for these facts to be understood by the public , and it may require new privacy legislation . Once we are able to have messages delivered almost instantaneously , the way we utilize them changes completely . // The total cost of mail delivery is gigantic , especially in North America . Americans are not only the most communicative people by telephone ; they also receive the most mail . More mail is sent in New York City than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the world 's largest nonmilitary employer . It spends almost $20 billion per year and is heavily subsidized by taxpayers . Manual mail delivery does not pay for itself . Much mail could be sent by telecommunications , and with large enough volumes the cost would be a small fraction of that for manual delivery . Amazingly , 70 percent of all first-class mail in the United States is generated by computers . Much of this is destined for other computers . It is printed , split into separate sheets , fed into envelopes , sent to a mail room , stamped , carried manually to a post office , sorted , delivered to planes and sent to another post office , sorted again , delivered to a mail room , sorted , distributed , and then laboriously keyed for entry into another computer . All this ought to take place electronically . Much noncomputer mail , including handwritten letters , can also be sent electronically . Once we use electronics , we should ask : What is the best form for a message ? Does it need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages delivered almost instantaneously. the way we utilize them changes completely . Instant mail will be fundamentally different from mail delivery by weary postmen . A typical telegraph message can be represented with less than 1000 bits . In the early days of telegraphy it was expensive to transmit 1000 hits . Today , speech is transmitted on digital telephone circuits at 64,000 hits per second . ' A // typical telephone conversation lasts around four minutes and hence requires about 15 million bits . Thus , a telephone conversation is equivalent to about 15,000 telegrams . Compared with the telephone , messages sent by telegraphy ought to be cheap with today 's technology . A copper-wire pair such as those that exist by the thousands under the streets of a city can carry 2 million bits per second . ' It could carry 2000 telegraph messages per second . In 1975 , slightly less than 1 million telegraph messages were sent per day throughout the world . A simple pair of copper telephone wires , therefore , could be made to carry all the world 's telegraph messages in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable system could transmit them in one second . ' Telephone traffic has to be transmitted in real time ; that is , when a person speaks , the speech must be transmitted almost immediately . To achieve a good grade of service ( i.e. , low probability of a caller encountering a busy signal ) , there must be idle channels ready for immediate use . No real-time systems achieve 100 percent utilization of their facilities . Statistical calculations determine how much idle capacity is needed to provide a given grade of service . Furthermore , the transmission capacity must be designed for the peak telephone traffic . The traffic during the peak hour of the day is several times higher than the average traffic ; the peak day is substantially busier than that of the average day . On a typical network the channels are idle 80 percent of the total time . Such is the nature of telephone traffic . On any network with idle capacity , mail or messages could be transmitted . On a telephone network , whether a public network or a private corporate network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone calls . As new facilities such as satellite systems are designed , they should be designed to handle a mix of telephone , video , mail , and message traffic . If a mechanism exists for handling non-real-time traffic in the gaps between telephone messages , a remarkably large capacity for mail and messages is available on today 's transmission links . It is worth looking closely at society 's non-real-time uses of information to see how the unused transmission capacity could be employed . If sufficiently large volumes were sent , electronic mail would be much cheaper than manual mail . The cost of electronic mail will drop substantially , whereas the costs of typing , addressing , delivering , receiving , opening , distributing , and filing paper mail are rising . Mail delivery is not real-time : We are happy if it is delivered an hour , or a day , later . We write letters , leave messages , send telegrams , order catalogs , transmit batches of computer data , and request books from libraries . This information transmission has two important characteristics . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone or other real-time traffic . Second , it can be interrupted in the // middle of transmission provided that the interruption is done in such a way that no information is lost . It is possible to convert any type of message into a digital form for transmission . Different messages require different numbers of bits . Table 11.1 gives some examples of approximate message lengths when mes sages are converted to bits and compressed , ready for transmission or storage . We could send photographs of various levels of quality , black and-white documents such as the output of a copying machine , voice messages such as those we leave on telephone-answering machines , typed memos , telegraph messages , computer transactions , bank checks , and so on . The brief spoken telephone message can be relayed , stored , delivered to its recipient , and filed , like a telegraph message . Unlike a telegraph message , it needs no special equipment ; it can be sent from and received by an ordinary telephone . It needs far more bits than a telegraph message if encoded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encoding the message for transmission is a more complex fashion to reduce the number of bits required by 90 percent . Devices that transmit documents are called facsimile machines . Many of them are in use today for transmitting documents over ordinary telephone lines . The good ones give a document quality comparable to // that of a xerographic copier and take between 1 ? and 6 minutes to transmit the document . Documents exist which digitize the facsimile transmission and encode a page into about 200,000 bits . The page can then be manipulated and stored by computers . Such devices will be employed in electronic mail systems . A page of text and numbers encoded like a telegraph message needs about one-tenth as many bits as a page sent in digitized facsimile form , but it can not contain signatures , handwriting , corporate letterheads , or diagrams , which can be sent in facsimile form . Messages can thus be sent in a large or small number of bits . Take your choice . As satellites and other digital facilities spread , the choice will increasingly relate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic it is desirable to have a priority system . Some traffic has a higher priority or rank than others . A message for a five-star general might be sent ahead of a message for a corporal even if the latter arrived first . In the simplest form there could be two priorities : real-time and non-real-time . However , there are different degrees of urgency in the non-real-time traffic , so several priority levels may be used to help ensure fast delivery for messages that require it . The system organization may be designed to permit the following categories of endto-end delivery time : I. Almost immediate ( as with telephone speech ) 2 . A few seconds ( as with interactive use of computers ) 3 . Several minutes 4 . Several hours 5 . Delivery the following morning When more than one message is waiting for transmission at any point , the higher-priority messages will be sent first . The fact that much of the traffic is not in the highest-priority category will make it possible to achieve a high loading of the transmission facilities . Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asterisks indicate which mail could be sent by electronic means , and hence potentially by digital channels . A single asterisk refers to mail that could he delivered electronically to the end user . Individual households may not send nor receive electronic mail . They may have neither the equipment nor the // desire to change their mail-sending habits . At some time in the future electronic mail will reach into consumers ' homes , but this case is not included in Table 11.2 . When government and business send mail to households , this mail could be delivered to the local post offices already sorted for delivery . All local post offices could have a receive-only satellite antenna on the roof and a high-speed facsimile printer . Advertising letters and promotion material have not been included as potential electronic mail , because they may contain glossy or high-quality reproductions . Some advertising letters could be sent by facsimile machines . Newspapers and magazines also have not been included , although there has been much discussion of customized news sheets being electronically delivered to homes . On the basis of Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end users by telecommunications , and 22.8 percent is potentially deliverable to post offices . By 1980 this had reached a total of about 50 billion pieces of transmittable mail per year in the United States . Some would require 200,000 bits each to encode ; most would require less because alphanumeric encoding rather than facsimile would be used . The daily total would be roughly 3 million bits , the capacity of 543 digital telephone circuits ' ? a small fraction of the capacity of one of today 's satellites . If only 1 percent of such mail were transmitted , it would pay for a large satellite system . The practicality of satellite mail is aided by the fact that three-fourths of all U.S. mail originates in only seventy-five cities , and only 20.2 percent of all mail originates from individuals , the rest coming from business and government . Today , message delivery that is faster than mail costs substantially more than mail . Bulk use of digital circuits ' offers the prospect of instant mail being lower in cost than any form of manual mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate communication users will probably still use the telephone because of its convenience , friendliness , and the cheapness of the instrument . The total number of telephone calls in North America is far higher than the total number of written communications . However , here is another provocative statistic . In the United States only 68 percent of long-distance calls and about 70 percent of local calls are completed . ' The rest encounter busy signals , no answer , or equipment failures . On the completed calls , the called party is reached only 35 percent of the time . In other words , less than 25 percent of calls attempted reach their desired party . II is estimated that this wastes // 200,000 person-years of callers ' time , which at $10,000 per year is equivalent to $2 billion . Telephone-switching computers can be designed so that callers can leave a telephone message , which would be stored and sent when the person dialed becomes available . The system may ring the called party periodically until it can speak the message . The called party could use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give confirmation of its receipt , or dial a response . The called party 's telephone may blink a light to indicate that messages are waiting to be delivered . The user may be able to dial the stored-message queue from a telephone other than his or her own , key in a security code , and receive the messages that have been left . If 10 percent of all business callers who failed to reach the individual they telephoned also left such a message , that would be several billion messages per year . Corporate executives , who can not afford the time , play telephone tag . A calls B and says " call me back . " B returns the call and A is not in , and so on . One-way telephone message systems avoid this , and save time by eliminating social chit-chat . Verbal telephone messages designed for machine delivery in a form rather like telegrams are referred to as voicegrams . Voicegram service could be valuable and widely used . Telecommunications facilities , appropriately organized , would give us the ability to send many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , automatic communication between typewriters or copying machines , data sent between computers , and so on . New technology satellites could make the cost of such messages very low . A single satellite could carry all such messages in its continent . They could be sent on the unused channel capacity of a telephone satellite . They could also be relayed over any other transmission facility , such as the telephone network , cable television , CB radio , or other mobile radio facilities . When mail or messages can be sent in seconds rather than in a day or two , the service is likely to be used in new ways . Documents or diagrams can be exchanged by two persons while they are on the telephone to one another . On the other hand , they may not telephone at all ; they may converse on a typewriter-like terminal if this costs less than a longdistance telephone call . Callers may prefer sending messages to talking // on the telephone when there is difficulty in making telephone contact with busy people . Some users of data networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . Communities of users have grown up bound by the ease with which they can interchange messages . As data networks become more widespread , this capability to send a message cheaply to another person 's terminal will become more popular . Most offices and many homes will have terminals for sending and receiving messages . Such a terminal could be derived by a cheap addition to an already existing electric typewriter . In viewdata systems the television set can be a means of receiving instant mail . When a message is sent to a subscriber a light glows on a television set , at home or in the office . The subscriber can then display the message . A guest late for dinner could send a message . Parents could send a bedtime message to children every night . A firm could broadcast messages to all employees . When mail is instantaneous it can become a dialogue . Two viewdata subscribers could talk back and forth via their television sets . With computers the system can put categories of persons in com munication . You might be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasts ( of the Third Kind ) . Cheap , fast message networks make it possible to hold meetings at which the participants are scattered across the world in their offices or homes . The participants send message in a formal fashion instead of making speeches . Not only are the participants in different towns or different countries ; they may not all be attending at the same time . Each has a terminal that logs what the participants have said , giving a serial number to each statement . An attender can wander into his or her office , read what has been contributed during the last few hours , and make a contribution if so inclined . A meeting between world authorities , all busy doing something else at the same time , could continue for days . The following is an extract from the minutes of a conference sponsored by Bell Canada with participants in various parts of the United States , Canada , and Great Britain . Each entry has a serial num ber , which participants can use to refer to it . It has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origination ( Eastern Standard Time ) , and then the message . It can be seen that sometimes hours may pass between one contribution and the next . The speakers in this extract were , respectively , in London ; Montreal ; Menlo Park , California ; and Washington , D.C. ' Our cultural heritage is increasingly being recorded on video media . We do not yet have the means to make this accessible . // Certain libraries throughout the world , often university libraries , have prided themselves on keeping a copy of every book published . A few still do , but they can not continue to do so much longer . It has been estimated that by the year 2040 there will be 200 million different books . To store these would require 5000 miles of shelves . The cost of storage and cataloging could be awesome . A card catalog like those used today would require 750,000 drawers . Even if such a library could be built and operated , it would be of limited value to its users . A user would have to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , and then the book might have been borrowed by another user . Clearly , the information deluge of our age needs electronic media to manage it . The volume of papers , journals , reports , and other information is far greater than the volume of books and presents even more difficult organization problems . The quantity of recorded information that people create began to grow after the invention of the printing press . It grew slowly at first . The Gutenberg press did not encourage new authorship , since it took years to set an existing book into print . Science and scholarship consisted of the study and restudy of ancient texts . However , the Renaissance brought new ways of thinking about the world , and slowly people began to acquire new knowledge . The first scientific journal appeared in the 1660s , more than two centuries after Gutenberg 's invention . By 1750 there were 10 scientific journals , and from then the number was multiplied by ten every fifty years , the approximate numbers being as follows : // 10 scientific journals in 1750 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific journals in 1900 100,000 scientific journals in 1950 By the 1950s the growth of recorded information was referred to as an information explosion . The term may not have been apt , because an explosion quickly ends its violent growth . The electronic media of the 1960s and beyond were to multiply the recording of information in a way unimagined in earlier eras . The number of scientific papers is increasing at a greater rate than the number of journals . The sum total of human knowledge was estimated to be doubling every ten years by 1950 and doubling every five years by 1970 . In most fields of research , even one as old as medicine , more papers have been published since World War II than in all prior human history . Computers in 1960 had one instruction manual ; by 1965 they had ten ; by the 1970s more than one hundred . The total engineers ' drawings of a jet plane weigh more than the plane . The new technology of information processing and transmission has turned up just in time for the needs of scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observes a number of fundamental inventions that arrived in one field of research just when they were needed to permit progress elsewhere . The thermionic vacuum tube , for example , arrived just in time to allow development in telecommunications . The first moon landing depended on a variety of newly developed technologies such as computers , and if any one of them had not been developed until a few decades later , the landing probably would have been impossible . We have reached a state now in human learning when the quantity of information being generated in industry , in government , and in the academic world would be entirely unmanageable without computers . The growth of information has no end in view , only greater growth . Automated means of filing and indexing research papers , engineering drawings , and other types of documents is becoming essential and must be coupled with means of searching for and retrieving the required information . Telecommunications links will enable people needing information to search with computer assistance through what is available . In searching for reports on a given topic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the distant computer . The computer might suggest more precise categorizations of what the user is seeking . The user might browse through many data indexes , titles , and // abstracts before finding what is wanted . Library systems will be made " public " so that a large number of people can use them , and a large variety of people can contribute to building up the data in the system . Banks of data on many subjects will grow in the years to come . The biochemist will be enabled to check what reports have been written on a particular topic ; the lawyer will have the mass of required literature electronically available ; and the patent agent will be enabled to carry out a search in " real time . " The New York Times morgue has been computerized so that writers may explore what articles on a given subject have appeared in that and other news media . Eventually , all manner of information sources will be connected to data networks , making them available to researchers and other users throughout the world . Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles electronically . Users will browse by means of a screen and a telecommunications link . Many users could have access to the same book at the same time , and they could have pages of it printed if they wished . There will be no card catalog . Instead , the computer will maintain indexes that will permit rapid searching for items , using the terminal screens . Such libraries will contain any matter that today appears in print , and much that does not . Electronic libraries can be accessible from anywhere with appropriate communications links . They can be used from offices where fast printing machines exist or from homes that have a device for displaying pages on the home screen . The card catalog of many libraries is very simple . You can look up an author or a book title . A user wanting to find books that relate to a given subject probably will not know the title of all such books , nor their authors . Computer systems now exist that enable users to search for the information they want . To make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book must be described in an abstract or set of subject headings or key words . This coding and classification is being done on much new literature . With its help , the user can search at a screen for reports that have been written on a particular topic . Large corporations use vast computerized information systems for accessing documents and reports . Similarly , huge systems of legal information and cases are in use . Computerized information retrieval is not limited to searching books and professional papers . Writers and historians often want to search past copies of newspapers . On some newspapers today the morgue ( so called because it is usually dismal and in a basement ) is microfilmed , and computers can automate the search for reports relating to given subjects . As we mentioned earlier , such systems as the // New York Times information retrieval system could provide access not only to published news but also to reporters ' original copy , most of which is not printed . This automated morgue uses techniques similar to systems for searching libraries , legal documents , patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accessible from around the world via data networks , can place vast quantities of information at our fingertips . They will not replace books . One of the joys of life for many people will still be to curl up with a good book . The new media will increase the c/irersity of information sources . If all worthwhile information were in printed form , the data networks now coming into existence could provide access to it . Computers would enable researchers , reporters , civil servants , lawmakers , and ordinary people at home to find whatever information they needed . Unfortunately , even such powerful facilities will not be enough , because a further information deluge of immense proportions is growing . McLuhanites insist that video information is in many ways becoming more important than print . The world produces several hundred hours of new television per day . By the year 2000 it will produce several thousand hours per day . In addition , there are movies and an increasing quantity of educational courses on videotape or film . Much of this is being preserved for posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is huge . The medium used to record a typical movie could record several thousand books . How much of the world 's video output ought to be made accessible via society 's library systems ? Certainly , much of it can be forgotten , as can much that is printed . However , some of each day 's output is worth preserving and should be indexed and made accessible , like books . The quality of video education is steadily improving , but many works that should be regarded ( and treated ) as classics are locked up , entirely inaccessible , in the archives of broadcasting or film companies . To mention only one such case , a colleague of mine made a brilliant film on Michael Faraday for the BBC . It was shown once ; one copy now exists , and even its maker can not gain access to it . It will probably never be shown again until some means of access to video libraries comes into existence . Great drama , the best films and comedy , and moments on television that achieve greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not yet have the means to make them accessible . History is being recorded on video media . Events , politicians , ordinary people , and the characters of future history hooks are being // filmed every day . You have a vague idea of what life was like in Victorian England , but your image of it is probably different from mine , because you have read different books and interpreted them differently . Similarly , you may have a vague idea of why the United States declared war on England in 1812 , but you probably have very little information about the mood of the times that led to the declaration . Persons in the future who want to know about our era will have available video images of the people , television shows that reveal their attitudes , interviews with politicians , documentaries , and programs of news commentary and argument . History can never be the same again . History can , however , be distorted , and film is an extraordinarily powerful and persuasive means of distortion . Clips of film taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false impression . A film can show the atrocities of one side in a war without showing the atrocities of the other . Freedom from distortion will require freedom of access to original films or programs . We have a tradition of freedom of access to books ; the burning of books is a cardinal offense associated with only the most disreputable of authoritarian regimes . Film destruction does not yet carry the same stigma as book burning , but it could be more potent in distorting the knowledge of the past . The burning of films will be easier to accomplish , because there are fewer copies . Using film , distortion of truth can be vivid and thorough . Information-retrieval computers for film libraries could operate in a way similar to those for book libraries . In the future , libraries could be automated so that films or video tapes could be automatically loaded and transmitted . Persons searching the library might then view segments of tapes that meet the search criteria and could check to see whether these segments meet their needs . Persons assembling documentaries or history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and might be able to record and edit directly from the library transmissions . It will be possible to build video networks linking film libraries , production studios , universities , or research organizations . The cost of such networks would be very high today , but it will drop to a reasonable figure with appropriate satellite systems . With appropriate technology , the television cable systems that are used in schools could be linked to video libraries as well . Some are so linked today , with manual library operation . Local town libraries may have screens linkable to a national video network . Eventually , the television cables into homes may be switchable to video libraries , although this would require a much greater total channel capacity than exists today . In discussing books , films , television , and libraries , we are concerned with society 's access to its information sources and records . As the information deluge increases , society will increasingly need techChap. // niques to select , edit , screen , and intelligently search the vast quantities of information . There are many types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the viewer has a very low level of selection . There is a wider choice with print . Access can be improved by the use of video libraries . It can be improved further by linking such libraries into a video network that can be accessed from many locations , and eventually from the home . As the trend from print to video information continues , society will increasingly need improved video channels . Small is beautiful if the pieces are in communication . // The lacing of the world together will be made more complete with portable radio devices . These add another aspect to the society change portended by new telecommunications . For many years science fiction has been full of small , portable , radio-operated devices like Dick Tracy wristwatch intercoms and paging devices that find James Bond no matter what he is up to . With the transistor , portable radio receivers suddenly become a reality  --  often a menace . Now , with mass-produced microminiature circuitry , more elaborate portable devices are possible . A miniaturized telephone keyboard could be worn on the wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazingly clear and strong signal . Devices small enough to be worn on the wrist can contain more than 10,000 transistors today . ( Transistor radios often contain 6 transistors . ) Semiconductor experts estimate that in the late 1980s a device that small could contain 1 million transistors . In the mid-1970s the sales of citizens ' band ( CB ) radio took off in the United States at a rate that took everyone by surprise , not least of all the regulatory authorities . CB is a service intended for short-distance personal or business radio communication , radio signaling , and the control of remote objects and devices . It is used by the public in large quantities for car and home radio-telephones and walkie-talkies . Prior to 1974 most CB radios were used by truckers . Now most of them are used in private cars for chit-chat between vehicles , emergency communications , avoidance of police speed traps , and pursuit of the opposite sex . CB users have a vocabulary of their own , with words like smokey // bear ( police ) , picture taker ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaky city ( Los Angeles ) , pumpkin ( flat tire ) , lettuce ( money ) , and Uncle Charlie ( the Federal Communications Commission , which regulates its use ) . The range of a typical unit is about 3 to 20 miles , depending on the geography . It is possible to place conventional telephone calls from a CB radio by means of a special telephone adaptor at the base station . Suitably equipped CB sets have a telephone dial or keyboard . Regulations restrict any one conversation to five minutes ; however , because of the crowded channels , most people limit themselves to much shorter bursts of speech . CB radio can not be used for advertising , soliciting sales , music , or entertainment . Most countries of the world have no CB radio . In Australia a substantial proportion of the public had CB radio when it was still illegal . In North America its popularity will probably cause its use to expand still further and have widespread use of interconnections to the telephone network . All the CB channels in use together occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that used by one broadcast television channel . The television broadcasting frequencies could be used for CB . The explosive growth of CB is an illustration of what can occur when a new use of telecommunications suddenly becomes fashionable . In 1974 , few U.S. families had heard of CB . By the end of 1976 , one in every sixteen families had a family license to use it , and new license applications were flooding in at the rate of half a million each month . Television had a similar explosive growth in the early 1950s . CB is only one of several mechanisms for speaking by radio . Dispatching systems are used mainly for communication between fleets of vehicles . The public is familiar with the radios used by taxi drivers . Many vehicles share in the radio channel . An operator controls the fleet and can hear the messages from all drivers . In many systems , a driver can hear the operator 's messages to all other drivers , although more elaborate addressing schemes can prevent this . Dispatching systems are used for controlling delivery trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles , and so on . Portable transceivers can be used in a similar fashion and are employed by police and security guards . Radio telephones provide a switched two-way channel between two conversing parties , like a conventional telephone . The radio telephone channel is connected to the facilities of the public telephone network . Calls can therefore be placed to any telephone subscriber from a telephone in a car , and if the car is in a suitable location it can hr called from a conventional telephone . Because of the shortage of // radio channels , few people can have radio telephones today . In some cities there are more persons on the waiting list than subscribers . The few who use radio telephones are plagued with busy signals because often no channel is free . There is a major new technology for radio telephones ' that enables any one radio frequency to be reused many times and gives excellent sound quality even when the user is in a car speeding through city streets . Portable telephones that could be carried in a pocket or briefcase have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Communications Commission allocated a large block of frequencies for mobile radio use . It is therefore possible now to provide a radio telephone system that would allow hundreds of thousands of people in a large city to have excellent service . Such facilities will be built in some cities during the next few years . Radio paging systems provide one-way channels to wandering users . The user carries a small unit clipped to a belt or in a pocket . Many such units share the same radio channel . Each unit reacts only to signals addressed to it , ignoring those to other units . The unit makes a beep to attract the attention of its wearer . Some units receive a voice message following the beep ; some can only receive beeps . A paging user receiving only a beep goes to a nearby telephone . He may dial a paging operator who has a message for him or who connects him to another caller . Some private-branch telephone exchanges handle paging so that the person receiving a beep dials his own number with a paging code and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivers can be small ; one is designed to be worn on the wrist . Some paging systems are connected to the public telephone network so that a person may be paged from any telephone . Paging systems are used for locating executives , sending duty calls to volunteer firefighters , and sending messages to representatives , newspaper reporters , doctors , and traveling staff . One of the most common uses is for maintenance and service personnel . When an office copier or computer breaks down , the local repair worker is contacted quickly by paging . Some such systems operate over geographic areas of 50 or 100 miles . When paging transmitters are coupled to a nationwide network , it is possible to page a person anywhere in that nation . The big problem with mobile radio devices is that the radio bands are overcrowded . The new micro-miniature electronics will permit devices with much more complex control mechanisms that can automatically search for free channels . The same radio frequencies will he used by many devices in different areas at the same // time . This technique and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile radio devices in the United States . In some other countries there is little or no activity in this field . AT &T; and others have commented that the techniques they have developed can make the quality , operation , and grade of service of mobile telephones similar to that of conventional telephones . Motorola has demonstrated the ability to make portable telephones not much larger than pocket calculators . The public normally thinks of radio as transmitting speech , music , and television , It can also transmit data . Transmission of data is much more economical than transmission of other information , and a large amount of information can be sent in a short time . The entire text of the Bible can be transmitted over one television channel in four seconds ? much quicker than when Charlton Heston does it . Data radio devices can be designed so that they only receive data or so that they both receive and transmit . Receive-only sets are cheaper and generally cause less problem with frequency allocation , because there is one powerful transmitter in an area rather than many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives , on the other hand , is capable of more versatile computer usage . It is now possible to build inexpensive computer terminals which can be held in the hand and which connect to computer networks via radio links . The potential uses of such devices are endless . Simple pocket transistor radios are now very inexpensive . In many ways it is easier to design a pocket device to receive data than to receive music . Various types of data could be broadcast , possibly from the same transmitters that broadcast sound radio . These data could be received by pocket calculators or other small devices . A digital wristwatch could be made to display the time , date , and stock market prices . Its alarm could be set to alert its owner if the price of a given stock fell below such-and-such a value . The market for such a device would be huge . Any rapidly changing data could be broadcast to pocket devices that could be set to display one item at a time or to scan the data stream for various conditions . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investing , or any application where changing data needs to be monitored . A car receiver could receive data about traffic conditions and data giving the exact position of the car . Luxury cars may display maps on a // screen showing the car 's location . Less expensive hand maps could be designed to be used in conjunction with the information received . A sound radio channel can be modulated to carry data and could operate inexpensive printers in the home or business and perhaps carry such information as Reuters news , the stock market ticker tape , sports reports , and weather forecasts . A television channel can carry far more information than a sound radio channel . With equipment of reasonable cost it can be made to carry several million bits per second . A terminal might receive blocks of a few hundred or a few thousand bits at a time , depending on the application . The channel could therefore either transmit different blocks to many different users or transmit a large number of blocks to every user , offering them a choice . Of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data at the same time as broadcasting television . A system developed by Hazeltine Research superimposes the data on the television lines without significantly degrading the picture quality . If one bit is imposed on each line , that gives a data rate of 15,750 bits per second . Other systems transmit data in the gap between the television frames . A television signal transmits the even lines on the screen , pauses while the scanning of the screen flies back to the top left-hand corner , then transmits the odd lines , pauses again , and repeats the process . The pauses are referred to as the vertical blanking intervals . There are sixty intervals per second in North American television and fifty in European . In Britain a standard exists for the transmission of data in the vertical blanking intervals . In each interval 720 bits are transmitted . The transmission of data superimposed on a television signal is known as teletext . In Britain the BBC developed a service called Ceefax.3 All British TV channels now broadcast teletext continuously and a similar service operates in other European countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display on the television screen . The viewer has a small keyboard that permits selection of particular pages , just as one could turn the pages of a magazine . The pages may consist of news summaries , weather forecasts , stock market information , details about television programs , or general-interest magazine pages . Teletext systems are designed to transmit up to 800 pages on one television channel without interfering with the television broadcast . This quantity of data pours through the viewer 's living room continuously . When he or she selects a page , the teletext unit grabs that page , stores it in a small memory , and displays it on the television screen . While the viewer is looking at a page , it is stored electronically in a small memory in the teletext unit . // The contents of a given page need not remain the same . It could be constantly changing , like the stock market ticker tape or the news flashed in Times Square . The user could select one page , programmed to change , and watch screen after screen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission , for example data broadcast over the air waves , can be made to appear like interactive transmission if a large quantity of data is sent . The user reads one screen and keys in a response . The response identifies another screen , which is then displayed . The response may be very short , for example , " 1 " or " 2 " meaning yes or no . The receiving device adds this response to a constant associated with the current screen to obtain the address of the next screen . In this way a user could carry out a dialogue with the receiver for such purposes as medical assistance , computer-assisted instruction , or interactive advertising . The Ceefax service employs only two lines in each vertical blanking interval ? that is , 100 lines per second . If the entire television channel were used , more than 15,000 lines per second could be employed . With more efficient page encoding , 1000 pages per second could be transmitted . If such a system were designed for an average response time of five seconds , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a total of 10,000 pages available on one television channel . This would be enough to allow highly elaborate dialogues to take place at a conventional television set equipped with an adapter . The adapter that the consumer needs to pick up a service like Ceefax is built into some expensive television sets . Teletext services of different types are in use in various countries , some employing cable television . Many of the early transmissions were oriented to businesses rather than home subscribers . Some companies plan to transmit racing results and sports news to bars and betting parlors . An adapter that enables a conventional television set to pick up broadcast data need not be expensive . It has been estimated that the Ceefax adapter could be marketed for about $300.4 If a full television channel were used instead of merely the vertical blanking intervals , the cost should not be much different . The adapter would be built into a microminiature circuitry , which is rapidly dropping in cost . With consumer acceptance the cost could drop as that of pocket calculators has . The television studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expensive . It consists of a minicomputer with a file that stores the pages . Studio staff use screen units attached to the // computer to compose , edit , and update the pages . The computer is connected to the equipment that inserts the rows of data into the vertical blanking intervals in the television signal ready for transmission . Broadcast data could be picked up by a pocket device just as broadcast sound can be picked up by a transistor radio . It is possible to design a wristwatch that tells not only the time and date but also the Dow Jones ( or other stock market ) average . The latter would be received by radio with a small antenna in the strap of the watch . The watch could receive the stock market ticker tape information . If it had a small keyboard ( like the pocket calculator watch ) , it could receive individual stock prices . Pocket machines that can transmit as well as receive data have a vast number of potential applications . One very appealing technology for this purpose is packet radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data . Packet radio devices have long been used with conventional computer terminals on some systems instead of connecting them to the telephone lines . ' Experimental terminals small enough to carry in a coat pocket have been designed using the same transmission techniques . ' Packet radio devices use radio frequencies similar to radio telephones . A radio telephone needs a channel all to itself while it is in use , because telephoners speak continuously . Packet radio devices , however , send only very brief bursts , a few thousandths of a second in duration . An active user might transmit such a burst every half minute or so . Consequently , hundreds of active devices can share the same channel . Since only a few of the existing devices will be active at any one time , thousands of devices could be allocated to one channel in the same area . Many thousands of packet radio devices might be operating in a city , sharing a hundred radio telephone channels . ( The United States Federal Communications Commission has recently allocated frequencies that could be employed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a pocket calculator , with a pull-out antenna like that on a transistor radio . When the user has entered a field , as one enters a number into a calculator , the device transmits a very brief burst of radio . Because the burst is so brief , a battery small enough for a pocket machine can power it . All over a given city these devices would he transmitting their bursts . The bursts would he relayed to different computers , possibly thousands of miles away on a data network , and the computers would respond . The reader might imagine the transmission of a burst as an instanChap. // taneous flash of intense light like that from a camera flashbulb . The light is a different color for each of the channels ? a hundred different colors . Hundreds of flashes occur every second throughout a city . If by accident two flashes of the same color occur at exactly the same instant , those transmissions might interfere with one another . If that occurs and the signals are damaged , the machines will detect this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other cities throughout the nation the same is occurring . The flashes in one city do not interfere with those in other cities , but the information in a flash can be relayed over a data network from one city to another in a fraction of a second . Thus , there can be many millions of packet machines throughout the nation intercommunicating or communicating with distant computers . The technology and frequency allocations could be such that most citizens could own such a device or every vehicle could be equipped with one . How could packet radio devices be employed ? The applications are almost as numerous as the applications of computers themselves . Individuals could send messages to one another . Pocket calculators could gain access to computer programs stored elsewhere . They could gain access to all manner of information sources and collections of data . They could be used for audience-response television , for placing bets and obtaining race results , for monitoring certain stock prices . In addition , they could be used to transmit and receive from conventional computer terminals in areas where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing nations . They could provide hand-held terminals for persons who walk around a factory , for patrolling security guards , for railroad marshaling yards , for farmers or foresters , and for doctors , nurses , or staff walking around a hospital . Contractors or users of earth-moving equipment could contact their base computer . Air travelers or commuters on tedious train rides could use their terminals for such functions as balancing their checkbooks , arranging meetings , holding network conferences , learning French , and so on . Two-thirds of a million Americans already carry personal radio receivers in the form of paging devices . There are many applications of radio paging , and its use is growing fast . It is used for calling foremen or expediters in factories , locating buyers or sales staff in large stores , calling service personnel , calling auxiliary firemen and telling them the location of a fire , requesting roving executives to come to the phone , and so on . Sonic paging systems , such as those within a hospital , are strictly local . Others cover a large area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of switching computers to locate a person almost anywhere in the country , provided that his or her transceiver is switched on and working . This situation need not necessarily constitute an invasion of privacy , because he would always be free to switch off his transceiver or leave it at home . His home area computer might store the identifications of persons who tried to reach him when his transceiver was off the air . In industry or government , key persons may be made permanently accessible by means of a transceiver they are not allowed to switch off during working hours . As with other forms of telecommunications , paging may spread from business usage to consumer usage . Packet radio could be used in utility meters for transmitting their readings periodically , or for monitoring potential earthquake or volcanic areas . Weather monitors , seismic monitors , and so on could be parachuted into forest areas . Burglar and fire alarms could use packet radio , immediately transmitting details of any violations . Individuals could be made to carry radio cartridges in high-security areas . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was not transmitting the correct code , the alarms would go off . The portable transceiver would give people a means of immediately contacting the police . This might prove very popular in a society in which the growth rate of crime rivals the growth rate of electronics . The police computers now spreading across the country would instantly pinpoint the emergency call and dispatch a patrol car . The fire and ambulance services could be contacted equally quickly . One can imagine a fleeing criminal being tracked by calls from persons near the scene of the crime as patrol cars close in . Radio devices could be used on every vehicle to identify it automatically . These could be used for automatically paying tolls or parking fees , for opening garage doors , for security control , and for enabling police to detect traffic violations or stolen cars . They could be used in mechanisms for lessening city traffic jams , or for obtaining assistance in parking . Packet radio could be used on trucks or delivery vehicles for sending messages , making inquiries , controlling the routing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation systems for controlling buses or other vehicles . People could use them for calling taxis . There are many highway safety applications , including fog and crash warnings , ambulance control , and breakdown assistance . Vehicles , buses , or accidents could be quickly located by triangulation . A keyboard in the car or in a briefcase could enable salespeople to transmit orders as soon as they were taken . Customers with problems could signal maintenance workers , who might he anywhere in a city . Maintenance workers could signal for help if they needed it . On the // way home people could signal their spouse to have dinner ready . Newspaper reporters could type and transmit their copy from their car . Uses of packet radio might be linked to automatic payment mechanisms . Automatic toll collection might be used to help regulate the flow of traffic into congested city centers . Parking fees may be similarly collected . When a packet radio signals some condition , a small payment automatically moves by telecommunications between bank accounts . The transceiver could also be used as a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own records stored in computer memory . One 's secretary or spouse could store entries on one 's shipping list or diary . If large numbers of portable transceivers come into use , new types of applications will become available . Those new functions would in turn increase the market demand . As with radio , television , and the telephone in their day , and recently CB radio in America , a snowballing effect would set in until much of the public owned such a device . They could be used in children 's toys for a wide variety of purposes . Children could have access to libraries or computer-assisted instruction . They could be invaluable for military field operations where other forms of communication are poor . They could be used in graphic applications on screens that require bursts of transmission at a speed too great for connection by telephone lines . In general , radio can extend the numerous applications of telecommunications to areas where cables can not be used ? in cars , on ships , trains , and planes , in the city streets and fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbering scheme , like telephone numbers , would be needed if subscribers carried their transceivers from one city to another . The same is true for radio telephones . In one proposed scheme each transceiver would be permanently associated with its owner , and a network of directory computers would be used to find the whereabouts of a person who was not then in his or her home area . Not all signals would immediately reach their distination . The whereabouts of the person called may not be known to the network , or the person called may have switched off his or her transceiver , not wanting to be disturbed . In such cases the stored-computer voice would inform the caller that such was the case . Like all new technology , radio transceivers have potential for ill as well as for good . Nevertheless , it seems likely that the social benefits will override or greatly outweigh the disadvantages . The world of the ubiquitous portable transceiver may be years away . It very much depends on government regulation of the radio frequencies . But in time it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . One satellite could have enough transmission capacity to provide every man , woman , and child in North America with a computer terminal . // The communications satellite is a very simple concept , as was the steam engine . When such new concepts appear , it sometimes takes a while for their potential to be understood . The potential of the satellite is so great that it will change the entire fabric of society . To make full use of this potential , we will have to launch communications satellites much larger than those of today . This could be done fairly soon , because of the availability of the space shuttle . A typical domestic satellite today is 6 or 7 feet long and weighs 400 to 500 pounds . Because the cargo bay of the space shuttle is 60 feet long and 15 feet in diameter , the shuttle could help launch communications satellites weighing many tons . Unlike today 's rockets , the space shuttle is reusable ; it can fly back to earth and land on an airfield ready for its next mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after each launch . Imagine having to throw away a 747-jumbo-jet after each flight . Although the potential of communications satellites is so great , satellite technology is entangled in legislation and politics that could prevent its potential being realized . As long as that potential is not understood by the public and by lawmakers , it is likely that the public will not gain the benefits . Unfortunately , most of the world 's lawmakers do not have a glimmering of the potential . Talking to a U.S. senator before the 1976 election , I found that he did not even know that a satellite could be used for telecommunications . A communications satellite is , in essence , a mirror in the sky : Radio signals are sent to it , and it sends them hack . It is placed in a special orbit 22,300 miles above the equator . In that position it revolves around the earth in 24 hours-exactly the time the earth takes to rotate-and hence // appears from earth to be stationary in the sky . The satellite remains in that position for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its position by firing small gas jets on board . The satellite generates the electricity it needs from sunlight ; at that height , it is always in sunlight except for brief eclipses in the spring and fall . The equatorial orbit in which communications satellites sit , apparently still , is over 160,000 miles long , so there will be many satellites above the earth , using different frequencies ( because of radio interference problems ) and forming a vast web that links together our machines , wall screens , electronic mail devices , and computers . Any one satellite is far enough away for it beams to span almost half the earth , but some worldwide transmissions will travel over two satellite hops . One satellite can handle a large quantity of information ; for example , four appropriately designed satellites could handle all today 's volume long-distance telephone and data traffic of the United States . The cost of satellite technology is dropping remarkably fast . There are three components to the cost : that of the satellite and its launch , that of the earth stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuits from the earth sation to the user . In 1965 , when the first commercial satellite was launched , the investment cost of the satellite was $23,000 per voice channel per year . By 1971 it was $618.1 By the early 1980s it will be in the region of $60 , and when the space shuttle is fully utilized it will be much lower . These figures relate only to the satellite and its launch ( referred to as the space segment ) . Earth stations ( the ground segment ) have been dropping in cost just as dramatically . The first earth station for AT &T's; Telstar satellite cost in the region of $50 million . The earth station for EARLY BIRD , the first commercial satellite , cost more than $10 million . Earth stations have dropped in cost until now a powerful transmit/receive station for the domestic satellites in North America can be purchased for about $100,000 . Stations that receive but do not transmit can cost only a fraction of this amount . NASA 's ATS-6 satellite , launched in 1974 , was moved along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thousands of villages that had never seen television before . It was designed so that the signals could be received with locally made earth stations costing $70 each . The terrestrial tail circuits represent 70 percent of the cost on many satellite systems in the United States today . This cost shrinks to zero when the early station is on the user 's premises . In general , the larger the satellite , the smaller and cheaper the // earth station . Cheap earth stations can be on user 's premises . The space shuttle will permit the launching of satellites that make earth stations cheap enough to sell in mail-order catalogs . Satellite transmission is dropping in cost as fast as pocket calculators are . We need to make sure that the public can benefit . The perception of the value of communication satellites has changed since the first satellites were launched . At first , satellites were perceived largely as a means to reach isolated places . The cost of lacing Africa and South America with conventional telephone engineering would be unthinkable , but satellites offer an alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the world . Countries with only the most primitive telecommunications put satellites on their postage stamps . As satellites dropped from their initial exorbitant cost it was realized that they could compete with the world 's suboceanic cables . Satellites then had a part to play in the industrial nations , linking the continental land masses . The owners of the suboceanic cables took political steps to protect their investment at the expense of satellites , but soon more transoceanic telephone calls were made by satellite than by cable . Television relayed across the ocean by satellite became common , because the cables of the 1960s did not have the capacity to send live television . COMSAT ( the Communications Satellite Corporation ) launched four generations of satellites in six years . EARLY BIRD , the first commercial satellite to retransmit signals from a fixed position in space , was followed by INTELSAT II in 1967 , INTELSAT III in 1968 , and INTELSAT IV in 1971 . When the first INTELSAT birds brought competition to suboceanic telephone cables , the domestic telephone networks seemed immune from the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high , and the United States Communication Satellite Act of 1962 said that only COMSAT could operate satellites and that they could be used only for international transmission . As had often happened before , technology changed more rapidly than the law . The first North American domestic satellite was launched in 1972 by Canada . It was originally thought of as a means to communicate with Canadians in the frozen North and was called ANIK , which means " brother " in Eskimo language . However , it was soon realized that the ANIK satellites would provide cheaper long distance telephone or television circuits than those of the established common carriers . The Canadians could take advantage of the harmful U.S. regulations and // market ANIK channels in the United States . Antennas were set up in the United States to use the ANIK satellites , and for their first two years in orbit these satellites earned a return on capital investment that was unprecedented in the telecommunications industry . A flurry of legislation in 1972 resulted in the U.S. Federal Communication Commission 's Open Skies Policy , encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellites . The first U.S. common carrier to take advantage of the Open Skies Policy was Western Union , which launched two WESTAR satellites in 1974 ; these were the first U.S. domestic satellites . A price war ensued for long-distance leased communication channels . A leased telephone circuit from coast to coast via WESTAR had a fraction of the cost of similar channels from the terrestrial common carriers . It seemed clear that the price could drop further with more advanced equipment . It became clear that there were major economies of scale in satellites . A big satellite could give a lower cost per channel than a small one . To take advantage of the economies of scale , satellites should be employed where the traffic volume was heaviest . Nowhere was it heavier than in U.S. domestic telecommunications , and so it began to appear , contrary to the earlier view , that there was more profit in domestic satellites than in international satellites . Nowhere was this perceived more clearly than in Bell Laboratories , the research organization of AT &T,; the world 's biggest telephone company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TELSTAR . A Bell Laboratories study gave the alarming conclusion that a few powerful satellites of advanced design could handle far more traffic than the entire AT &T; long distance network . ' The cost of these satellites would have been a fraction of the cost of equivalent terrestrial facilities . However , government regulations prevented AT &T; from developing the satellites which it , more than anyone else , could make good use of . The field was left open for competition . A number of corporations , at first small ones , announced that they would operate satellites , and AT &T; proceeded to spend many billions of dollars per year on expanding its terrestrial facilities . For WESTAR users the perception of satellites had now become that of communication pipelines linking five earth stations in one country . A further perceptual change was to follow . While corporations and computer users thought of the satellite as providing two-way channels between the relatively few earth stations , broadcasters or would-be broadcasters saw it as a potentially ideal way to distribute one-way signals . Television or music sent up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a portion of the satellite capacity were used for sound channels for education or news , a very large num114 Satellite Age Chap . 14 ber of channels could be broadcast . The transmitting earth stations would be large and expensive , but the receiving antennas could be small and numerous . The Musak Corporation envisioned 3-foot receiving antennas on the roofs of their subscribers ' buildings . Satellites offer the possibility of broadcasting television to vast areas of the world that have no television today . If more powerful satellites could be developed and launched , television could be broadcast directly to the hundreds of millions of homes in industrial countries . Even with satellites of today 's power , television could be distributed in hundreds of regional stations for rebroadcasting over today 's transmitters or cable television systems . In the United States various new television networks are spreading nationwide using satellite relays . One is the Public Broadcasting Network ; another is a cable television network that distributes Home Box Office for an extra monthly charge . Both are noncommercial networks that promise a major programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans and has a satellite designed specifically for television broadcasting . This will permit the use of inexpensive receiving stations that can be installed in individual offices and homes . It is easy to imagine Japanese satellite television receivers , employing a larger satellite , spreading across the world in the 1980s as Japanese transistor radios did in the 1960s . Broadcasting is usually thought of as having one transmitter and many receivers . However , when a satellite is used for two-way signals , a form of broadcasting is taking place in which there are many transmitters . Each earth station is , in effect , a broadcasting transmitter , because its signal reaches all other earth stations , whether they want it or not . Each earth station , like a radio set , tunes in only to the signal it wants to receive . Because of this broadcasting nature of satellites , it is limiting to think of a satellite as a " cable in the sky . " It is much more than that . A signal sent up to the satellite comes down everywhere over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telecommunications , any user in that area should be able to request a small portion of the vast satellite capacity at any time and have it allocated to him or her ( if at that moment there is any capacity free ) . Just as with a telephone network , any user should be able to call any other user when he or she wants . In contrast to the telephone network , it should also be possible to request different types of channels ? television , high-speed data channels , bursts for electronic mail , and so on . To enable many users to share satellite channels in this way , ingenious control mechanisms have been built which allocate the channel capacity to users when they request it . For the first decade of communications satellite operation , most // of the capacity of the satellites was used for telephone traffic and television . The technology has evolved , however , so that in a sense satellites are much more powerful for the transmission of data . It now appears desirable for technical reasons to carry satellite telephone traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the telephone voice is digitized in a simple manner , it becomes 64,000 bits per second . When it is digitized in a more compressed fashion , 24,000 bits per second is a typical bit rate . A typical satellite contains many separate relays ( called transponders ) , each of which transmits a channel of many million of bits per second . Many telephone calls can occupy one such channel . The satellites launched by Satellite Business Systems ( SBS ) will transmit many channels of 48 million bits per second each . ' This transmission rate can carry one television signal . A vast quantity of data can be sent using these bit rates . Such bit rates make telephone voice appear expensive by comparison with data transmission as a means of transmitting information . The potential power of satellites for the computer industry can be illustrated by means of a simple calculation . When a person uses a computer terminal , he or she does not transmit continuously at the full speed of the channel . As we described in Chapter 9 , the transmis sion consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most dialogues with computers result in not more than 1.0 bits per second passing back and forth on the average , although at certain instants a much higher rate is being sent . The RCA GLOBECOM satellite , launched in 1976 , has 24 channels ( transponders ) . Each channel can transmit 50 million bits per second . This gives a total possible throughput of 1200 million bits per second through one satellite ; however , it would not be possible to achieve 100 percent utilization of this bit rate . A conservative assumption is that 20 percent efficiency could be achieved ( much lower than today 's equivalent on well organized terres trial lines ) . Even this efficiency would give a usable capacity of 240 million bits per second . The combined population of the United States and Canada is about 240 million . Let us suppose , for the sake of this illustration , that every person makes substantial use of computer terminals . If the average working person uses them one hour per day and the average nonworking person one half hour per day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day . Let us suppose that in the peak hour of the day the usage is three times the daily average . The total data rate in the peak hour is then // In other words , one satellite could have enough transmission capacity to provide every man , woman , and child in the United States and Canada with a computer terminal . In addition ( as we have done the calculation for the peak traffic hour ) , twice as much non-real-time data ( such as electronic mail ) could be sent over the same satellite at times other than the peak hour . This calculation assumes , as does any such discussion of the power of satellites , that it is possible to organize terrestrial facilities for the satellite channels appropriately . In this case , how does one enable an extremely large number of users to share the same channel without interfering with one another excessively ? Technology that would make this possible has been demonstrated , but in addition to the technology , appropriate structuring of the corporations or organizations that provide the facilities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data transmission , it would not be a sound business operation to launch a satellite solely for use with computers . A relatively small proportion of all the traffic that might be sent by satellite is computer traffic . To maximize its potential profit a satellite should be capable of carrying many different types of signals : real-time and non-real-time , voice , data , electronic mail , and video . For all these signals , the satellite should be regarded as a broadcasting medium accessible from anywhere beneath it , not as a set of cables in the sky . To summarize , the perception of what a communication satellite is has changed , and different perceptions have been : 1 . A means to reach isolated places on earth 2 . An alternative to suboceanic cables 3 . Long-distance domestic telephone and television links 4 . Television and music broadcasting facilities 5 . A data facility capable of interlinking computer terminals everywhere 6 . A multiple-access facility capable of carrying all types of signals on a demand basis The changing perception of satellite potential has been related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future will have small dish-shaped antennas on their rook or near their buildings , pointing at the satellite . In some cases these will he small ( say , 4 feet in diameter ) for receiving signals only ; in other cases they will be larger ( say , 15 to 20 feet in diameter ) for // receiving and transmitting . By the end of the 1980s North America will have hundreds of thousands of satellite earth stations . To deploy vast quantities of satellite antennas in this way , it is necessary to ensure that the transmission does not interfere with exist ing radio links on earth . Unfortunately , today 's commercial satellites operate at the same frequencies as the telephone companies ' microwave radio links . Therefore , a new generation of satellites is planned , operat ing at higher frequencies which are not used by any earth-bound facilities . Many different corporations share the same satellite channel . Satellite transmissions can be picked up over a much wider area than the telephone companies ' microwave radio transmissions . It is necessary to maintain a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received only by the party they are sent to . Extremely tight security can be achieved by enciphering the signals as wartime spies do with their transmissions ; however , now the enciphering would be incomparably safer because it would be done by computer-like devices and the codes are virtually uncrackable . A computer can scramble the bits in such a formidable fashion that no cryptanalyst could unscramble them . Today 's satellites are an elementary beginning , like the first steam engine . One day we will look back at WESTAR , the first U.S. domestic satellite , which we use today , with the amused but admiring sense of history that we have when we look at Explorer I , America 's first , grapefruit-sized response to Sputnik . The circular orbit 22,300 miles above the equator will contain masses of hardware . Beams of higher frequency and higher information-carrying capacity , possibly laser beams , will eventually be used by the satellites . A major factor in satellite design is weight . If the satellite is heavy , it can have more power and more capability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper . The power of the satellite depends on how much electricity it generates from sunlight . Typical domestic satellites today generate 150 to 300 watts ? enough to light two or three household light bulbs . With larger solar panels ( like those of the Skylab manned orbital laboratory used by the astronauts in 1975 ) , many thousand watts of electricity will be generated . There is no practical restriction other than cost to the amount of energy that could be generated in geosynchronous orbit . The total solar energy intercepted by a strip 10 miles wide at the geosynchronous position is hundreds of times greater than the total amount of electricit consumed on earth . Indeed , there have been serious proposals from NASA4 nd Arthur I ) . I.ittle5 for building in the communications satellite orbit a solar power station generating , Lout 10.000 megawatts enough power to supply the whole of New York City . 1 // To project this further , a dozen such stations would generate energy equivalent to half the current U.S. energy consumption . The biggest problem would be getting the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause harm . The total cost of power generation in orbit could be lower if it is done on a large enough scale . Nuclear generators in orbit have also been proposed . A second important factor in satellite design is the diameter of the dish-shaped antenna on the satellite , which points to earth . The power the satellite can relay is proportional ( within limits ) to the fourth power of the diameter of the antenna . For example , a 10-foot antenna will relay sixteen times as much power as a 5-foot antenna . Five feet is a typical diameter for today 's satellites . However , in the utter stillness of space , with no gravitational force or breath of wind , a large antenna can be a fine gossamer-like structure , impossible on earth . The 100-foot-diameter aluminized Mylar sphere of the Pageos satellite weighed only 120 pounds . NASA design studies have described antennas for astronomical telescopes 10 miles in diameter , deployed in orbit as a fine spinning mesh pulled into position by centrifugal force . FUTURE The satellite uses described in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been launched . Satellites launched with the space shuttle in the 1980s can have more advanced uses , because they can have much greater weight , power , and antenna size . Unlike today 's communications satellites , they might be assembled with the help of astronauts . Some future satellites will contain computers for switching and control purposes . A design study done by the Aerospace Corporation for NASA describes wrist radio telephones that could place and receive telephone calls via the conventional telephone network . ' They would not be much larger than today 's digital wristwatches and would sell for about the same price . ( The cheapest walkie-talkies today retail for $8.95 a pair . ) They would use batteries that are recharged every night , and as with today 's watches , all their electronics would be on one microcircuit " chi " P ? The wrist telephone would transmit directly to and receive from a satellite . In this proposed design the satellite weighs 7.3 tons and uses an antenna 200 feet in diameter . This can be of lightweight construction , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibration , no rain , frost , or corrosion ? just the utter stillness of space . The satellite power requirement is 21 kilowatts , which is less than that used aboard the Skylab satellite in N75 . It is estimated that erne such satellite could // serve 2.5 million wrist telephones across the United States and that the cost would be $300 million . ' The total value of the terrestrial U.S. telephone plant at the time will be over $100,000 million . The same study describes even more ambitious satellite uses , made possible by more complex satellites , some with antennas 2 miles long . Satellites could be used for thorough surveillance of national borders , for aiding in more complete weather forecasting , pollution control , and energy use monitoring , for keeping track of radioactive materials , for tracking vehicles , railroad cars , or packages . They could provide wristwatch navigation aids that would tell the wearer 's exact location and calculate the distance and direction of any given map reference ; how accurately they did this would depend on the size and cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between pocket calculators . Owners of such calculators could send messages to one another , use each other 's programs , obtain stock market results , or retrieve information from large numbers of data banks . Satellites are already providing secure worldwide communications for the military . They could give the police much better facilities than today and offer a means of tracking criminals across state or national borders . They could provide wristwatch emergency and rescue aids , burglar and fire alarms , or diplomatic hot lines between all heads of state . Some time during this century a vast industry will grow up , placing massive hardware in orbit in a ring around the earth 22,300 miles above the equator . Eventually , it will become economical to have service vehicles in this orbit , repairing , refueling , or assisting in the development of the satellite equipment . That an immensely powerful communications technology is within our grasp seems beyond doubt . There remains the question of cost . Where will the money for the new thrusts that are now technically possible come from ? The total investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is huge . AT &T; alone is spending $9 to $10 billion per year on capital improvement of the Bell System . AT &T's; top management have indicated that they intend this level of expenditure to continue . The annual revenue from telecommunications in the United States is over $40 billion and is growing by about $5 billion per year . Much of the capital expenditure in the telecommunications industry is going into the trunks and trunk switching that satellites and demand-assignment equipment could replace . Six ATS-6 satellites with appropriate transponders ( 1974 technology ) could carry as much traffic as the peak traffic on the Bell System toll network ( i.e. , not including local telephone calls ) . If earth stations were associated with the toll offices in the 500 most // populous cities , such a satellite network would cost less than S2 billion . If it had a lifetime of ten years , the cost would be 5200 million per year . ( Most telecommunications equipment has a forty-year lifetime . ) Nobody is suggesting that satellites should replace the telephone network . They can economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between user locations , and very high speed data transmission . The next major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of scale that today 's technology offers . This can be done only by a large organization with abundant funds . We will not see the low cost per channel that is now possible if we continue to launch small satellites such as ANIK , WESTAR , and SYMPHONIE . Government regulation , however , is constraining AT &T; from moving freely into the satellite business . NASA , which always launched the most advanced satellites , is being prevented from designing successors to ATS-6 . The European administrations , while singing the praises of SYMPHONIE , are unlikely to put up American-launched satellites that would constitute major competition to European telephone trunks . The barrier to acquiring low-cost satellite channels is thus not technological but political . The telecommunications society will require far more creative people than today . 15 HOME In the early computerized television games , bouncing balls or match= stick figures and spaceships moved across the screen and responded to the player 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become film sequences , and when the player shoots down a spaceship it explodes in vivid color across the 7-foot screen with flaming chunks of metal spinning past the player . Samurai warriors race across the screen and , if the player wins , die spectacularly . Kamikaze planes hurtle at the player or shoot-outs take place on jetport runways with quadraphonic sound . These spectacular playthings use two synchronized film sequences compressed so that they are transmitted together over a single television channel . The player sees only one at a time . His or her game-playing responses cause a microcomputer to display text or still images on the screen and to cut at appropriate moments to one or another film track . Videodisc machines are much more versatile . With these a computer can switch to 54,000 different video tracks on each side of today 's video discs , and can display on the television screen moving television , still pictures , or frames of computer data . A wide diversity of such games will be produced and recorded on video machines . These machines may be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with games transmitted on the television cables , where there can be endless variety . The machine that receives games con also receive utterly captivating education programs which the viewer interacts with . On the Saturday afternoon of the future while the children play Star Wars on the screen , the head of the household may be immersed in sport . I Ie watches one game on the big screen while a printer at his side spatters out news of other games . With his keyboard he can request the // results of other games to be displayed on the screen . He can freeze a frame of the televized play at any moment and examine it . While displaying one game , the more affluent viewer may be recording a different one . With the recorder he can replay exciting moments . The teenager of the family may receive messages via the television set from a video dating service . These tell him to watch the dating program on the local cable at a certain time when two of the potential dates the computer selected for him will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can watch them being interviewed in the studio before committing himself . The wife plays a computerized organ . It can synthesize a great diversity of sounds , making the keyed notes sound like a piano , a piccolo , a church organ , and all manner of other instruments . If it is set to play like a clarinet it can play a 9-inch clarinet , an 18-inch clarinet , and so on , up to a 30-foot clarinet which exists only in the mathematics of the computer . A similar diversity of percussion sounds is available , and the machine can be set to automatically play rhythm backgrounds ? many different rhythms . The player can play tunes against the rhythm background , or can compose or store tunes which the machine plays . When the machine stores a theme it can play it without the operator , with the selected rhythm background . The machine can be connected by telephone to a service computer which can transmit the coded themes of the latest pop tunes . A suitable arrangement of any such theme can then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuitry is leading to many new consumer devices . Electronic calculators , television games , and wristwatches are a start . Microcomputers the size of a wristwatch can be mass-produced for less than $2 . These , in combination with new communications networks , make possible all manner of new items for the home . In the advertiser 's paradise of America , all kinds of highly colored catalogs can become available on new telecommunications media , and there will be varied enticements for exploring them . Very elaborate presentations of products will become possible . The Sears Roebuck catalog , for example , might include film sequences , although the user will still be free to " turn the pages , " to use the index , to select and reject . As with American television today , advertising would help to pay for the new medium . Perhaps critical consumer guides will also become automated to aid product exploration . Having scanned the relevant catalogs and inspected pictures of the goods in detail , the shopper could then use the same terminals to order items , perhaps with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The telephone line , in addition to its normal use , could be used // for activating household appliances . A family driving home after a few days ' vacation or a person about to return from work may telephone home and then key some digits on the pushbutton telephone that switch on the heat or air-conditioning unit . This would save fuel costs . Before leaving for work a person will preprogram the kitchen equipment to cook a meal . He or she will then telephone at the appropriate time and have the meal prepared . Cookers with built-in microprocessors will become very elaborate , capable of accepting lengthy sequences of instructions such as " heat the oven to 450 ? F to cook the roast that has been placed in it ; one hour later move some vegetables out of the freezer compartment ; leave them to thaw for one hour ; lower the oven temperature to 300 ? F ; heat the vegetables in their aluminum foil to 3 00 ? F ; switch on the dish warmer ; heat the soup .... " An intelligent cooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three types : one at room temperature , one refrigerated , and one deep-frozen . Food would be specially packaged for recognition and use by such a machine . The machine would be programmed to access its food compartments and prepare a meal . It could automatically reorder the stocks it needed . Once such machines become widely sold and drop in cost , the main concern , as with computers , videodiscs , and other such devices , will be software . The world 's great chefs will be hired to make the automated cookers produce gourmet meals . Packages sold for use with the cooker will include exotic herbs , spices , and sauces . Just as manufacturers of chess-playing machines enter their devices in world chess championships , so cooker manufacturers will aspire to have their machines earn three Michelin stars . More expensive models may be able to telephone for instructions . This will greatly increase their versatility and be appealing to the cooker owner . For the food packager it will be a means of selling more products . The device may display suggested menus based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display menus of dishes it could produce if it extended its inventory . It may be designed so that , using telecommunications , it can advertise to its owner the latest gourmet meals available that it can cook . The early attempts to take the work out of the cooking produced pretty awful food , such as TV dinners . With today 's electronics , automated cooking could be made superb . Once automated cooking establishes a marketplace , the cooking units will increase in complexity and the prepackaged food industry will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on creating new foods , mixes , and flavors for the automated gourmet cooks . One of the great fears at the start of the microcomputer age was that automation would cause mass unemployment . In reality it can // create such a vast and rich array of products that whole new industries are needed . These new industries are limited mainly by the shortage of trained people . People who are prepared to learn can find work , earn money , and find endless ways to spend it . Various think tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern telecommunications could provide in the home . Some experimental systems have set about providing them , proving that at least the technology can work . The following is a list of some of the possible home services , omitting ones that seem particularly dubious economically , such as menu selection and shopping list management . All the items on this list could be carried out using today 's telephone system and multichannel television cables , preferably with reverse channels . Many additional applications would be possible if there were better video channels ? an individual channel into each home , switched channels , or video channels from the home . As these would be sub-stantially more costly , their existence is not assumed in this chapter , but again we may note the need for a society wired with channels of higher capacity then telephone . 125 Chap . 15 Home // // Widespread use of home terminals may be sponsored by employers who expect to benefit from them . What would they use them for ? The most obvious is work connected with the computer industry ? writing programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , design , or other work , using complex design techniques programmed in distant computers , obtaining technical documents , looking up facts , running teaching programs , and exercising newly learned skills . They or their children may decide they need to learn a new computer language . For several evenings they must spend an hour with a manual and at a terminal using a teaching program . The only way really to learn a computer language is to program in it . So they will dial up a computer that enables them to program with a given language and then spend a period each evening developing their ability to use the new tool . Given the right telecommunications almost any white-collar work could be done at home . Secretaries can type there or answer telephones . Typing pools can be distributed . Accountants can work with terminals at home . In writing a report , a group of authors can type the text directly into their respective home terminals . The report resides in the memory of a distant machine . They can then modify it , edit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's work , add to each other 's ideas , and instruct the terminal to type clean copies when they were ready . Magazine editing will be done with such aids in the future . If the facilities are available , it seems logical for some employees to spend at least part of their time working at home rather than at an office . The overhead cost of providing staff with offices and desks is very high , especially in large cities ; some of this cost will therefore be saved by the use of home terminals . A manager can see what remote members are doing by telephoning them , dialing up the computer they are using and examining their work , and sending them instructions on their home terminals . Some companies have almost no offices . Some software companies for producing programs have cut costs significantly by havint. ' most of ' their staff work at hone . Parents who must be at // home to care for their children could also benefit from such a scheme ; child rearing would no longer exclude them from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other organizations place word-processing machines in the homes of part-time secretaries . This has been done in cities where secretaries are in short supply , such as Chicago . An extension of this is to place office-of-the-future terminals in the home . Some executives and professionals like to have the same terminal facilities at home that they have in their office . They can then work late at night or early in the morning if they feel like it . They can process their mail and send work items to other employees . Working at home can be very productive for people who have tasks to complete , such as writing reports . It is away from the endless distractions of the office and its telephones . To work effectively at home needs a spouse-proof , child-proof , tax-deductible office . As working at home spreads , it may change the architecture of homes . The growth of computerized teaching will need a tremendous amount of human thought and development of programs . It is possible that automated education ( using videodisc , videotape , broadcast television , and computer techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of intellectual craftsmanship needed to create this industry is staggering . Much of this endeavor may take place in the home , just as books are written at home today . Step by step , a teacher can build up lessons on a home terminal . Occasionally , he or she may dial a colleague to ask him to use his terminal to try out the lessons . When the work is near completion , the teacher may try it out in a classroom , study the reactions of students , and return home to make appropriate modifications . Homes of course creators will be equipped with video editing machines for assembling tapes and interactive video material . Where suitable cables exist the course creators can develop superb programs with relative ease . These courses can then be made available to all the world 's libraries . This is possible not only for teaching programs but also for many other computer uses now within our grasp . Electronic magazines , advertising catalogues , legal data banks , medical data banks , data banks for all types of professional users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take an enormous amount of intelligent effort to build up . Much of this work is likely to he done with terminals , probably terminals that impose standafdired formals on the // data being entered . We have to rewrite all our textbooks , courses , and reference documents in a form that gives terminal users access to the data with computerized and video material . Here we see the beginning of a return to a form of " cottage industry . " While some people are employed by corporations to work at home , others will do so on their own initiative , creating new teaching programs or software for us on the ubiquitous computer networks . Enormous quantities of ingenuity and programming are essential to this new era ? not the work of geniuses but ordinary step-by-step construction and testing . The work requires a high order of craftsmanship . In general , it is creative , enjoyable work , work that persons at home can do , work that disabled and blind people are now doing . Some spastics are wonderful programmers and software architects . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to make money in his or her spare time will contribute enormously . It is vital that the products of such work be covered by copyright laws , so that these individuals can earn appropriate royalties . Like the authors of bestselling books , the authors of programs or data files that come into widespread use make big money from them . If the right financial reward structure exists , the growth will be explosive . People with this talent can make much more money doing their own work than working for a big corporation . A major function of corporate personnel departments is to obtain cheap , intellectual labor . They are concerned that employees do not find how much they would be worth on their own . They create incentives for not leaving , such as pension and medical schemes , and an ethic of employee loyalty . Many such employees caught in the organization trap are far less creative than they would be on their own . One of the most rapidly growing pastimes is hobby computing . Computer hobby stores are flourishing in cities around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be bought and it is rapidly becoming much more powerful . Magazines for computer amateurs are rapidly growing in sales and symposia held for them attract massive crowds . Before long many schoolchildren will have their own computers , and young people will bring a new level of creativity to computing . From this mass of young enthusiasts many computer geniuses will emerge . Computer hobbyists have more reason to communicate than other hobbyists . It is enormously fascinating to try out other people 's programs . News about a particularly interesting program spreads rapidly
