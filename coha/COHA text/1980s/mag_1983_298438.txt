" While serving as head of the Gestapo in Lyon from 1942 to 1944 , Barbie ordered the execution of more than 4,000 people and the deportation of 7,000 French Jews to concentration camps . His hands were also stained with the blood of Jean Moulin , France 's most revered Resistance leader , who is believed to have died under torture in 1943 . Twice Barbie was tried in absentia for his crimes and sentenced to death by French tribunals . But for more than three decades the Nazi managed to escape punishment and , indeed , prospered in Bolivia under the alias Klaus Altmann . <P> Last week Barbie , 69 , was back in Lyon , locked away in Montluc , the prison where he tortured and jailed thousands .

Barbie immediately repaid the debt , plus interest , but it did him little good . Instead of releasing him , Bolivian officials put him on a plane bound for Cayenne , the capital of French Guiana . When told he had been handed over to French authorities , the Butcher of Lyon made a gesture , as if slitting his throat . <P> The French government did everything it could to ensure that Barbie was hustled out of Latin America without incident . The Elyse dispatched a presidential DC-8 jet to Cayenne to fly him back to France . West Germany had also sought Barbie 's extradition , but the Bonn government decided to let the French have him .
