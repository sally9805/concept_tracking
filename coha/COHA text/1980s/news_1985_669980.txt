EL IMPOSIBLE , El Salvador  --  Most people here remember 1981 as a nightmarish year in this troubled land ' s civil war . But Daniel Burgos says it was a great year for iguanas . Over the past decade or so , El Salvador ' s iguana population has fallen to alarmingly low levels  --  because the lizards are popular menu items , among other things  --  and Mr. Burgos heads a Salvadoran National Parks and Wildlife Service project that is trying to reverse the trend . Its first big victory came in 1981 , when two underground iguana nests were dug up and the 50 eggs artificially incubated , with 38 of them eventually hatching . In the years since , the " iguaneros , " as iguana people are called , have overseen the hatching of nearly 20 , 000 iguanas in captivity . Most have been released to the wild , and the population is starting to recover . With war still fracturing this country , the iguana emergency isn ' t . But to those involved , that makes it no less urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe in 10 years , if nobody does anything , " says Dagmar Werner , a West German scientist heading an ambitious Iguana Repopulation Project in Panama , where there also are problems . Iguanas , of course , aren ' t absolutely necessary . But as the largest lizards in the Americas they are nice to have around . Besides , they have an ecological niche as eaters of plants and insects and as a source of food for man . Most iguanas dwell in the American tropics . Many people find their looks menacing , but experts say they are exceedingly shy . They can grow to four or five feet long , with at least half the length being their whip-like tail . " Maybe their physical attributes don ' t help people to like them , " Mr. Burgos says . " But physical attributes are one thing . The animal itself is another . " He adds : " Iguanas have survived for thousands and thousands of years . They are very special , very ' simpaticas . ' " And very tasty , to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which supposedly tastes like chicken , and their eggs , which are said to boost one ' s sexual prowess . Iguanas also suffer from the leveling of tropical forests for agricultural and other uses and from pesticides . And with few exceptions , meaningful environmental laws don ' t exist in the Third World , where human survival is more the issue . It isn ' t iguanas that win Mr. Burgos his $50 , 000 or so a year in government financing ( some of it in the past including money from the U.S. Agency for International Development ) ; it ' s that his project creates about 40 jobs for humans , most of them dirt-poor campesinos . The project ' s first camp was set up in a national park in troubled San Miguel province , long a center of guerrilla activity . The government hoped to defuse political tensions there by creating jobs . To emphasize their peaceful intentions , the iguaneros soon stopped carrying guns or radio equipment  --  a reasonable precaution , for the camp regularly gets overrun . " It ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the night , " says Manuel Benitez Arias , head of the parks service . Both sides leave the iguana people alone . Three other camps subsequently were set up in more peaceful parts of the country , including this park near the Guatemalan border . Jose Antonio Gomex Ventura , who oversees all the threatened-species programs of the parks service , thinks the iguana population could recover fully in five years , if all goes well . But it probably won ' t , he says , given such things as the continuing human appetite for iguanas . Still , he notes that most roadside vendors are selling local iguanas these days  --  a change from a few years ago , when the local lizards were so scarce that people were importing iguanas from neighboring Honduras and Nicaragua . " That ' s bad , " Mr. Gomex Venura says of the sales . " But it ' s a sign that our iguana population is recuperating .
