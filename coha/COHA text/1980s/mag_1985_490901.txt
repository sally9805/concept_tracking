THE TAM OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment DURING the first few weeks after the kidnapping and assassination of the Reverend Terzy Popieluszko , Poland 's Jaruzelski regime seemed to move quickly and decisively in investigating the crime , apprehending at least some of the perpetrators , and launching their prosecution . The public trial of four security policemen accused in the crime was itself an unprecedented event in a Communist country , and it afforded an unprecedented view of some of the inner workings of the security apparatus upon which this particular regime relies for much of its stability . It was not a pretty picture , but there was a certain moral authority to be claimed from the regime 's decision to expose it at all , and especially in such a public fashion . Whatever moral capital the regime might he said to have amassed through its initial conduct of the investigation , however , it seemed hellbent on squandering last week during the final days of the trial . For one thing , it became increasingly unclear just who was on trial , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges allowed testimony blackening the memory of the young priest . As perhaps the most popular of the group of parish priests who used their sermons as occasions for ongoing moral witness throughout the period following the imposition of martial law , Father Popieluszko had been subject to repeated police harassment . At one point , in a sudden search of his modest flat the police claimed to have uncovered a cache of explosive devices  --  an obviously bogus claim , based on a fairly transparent planting of evidence . Armed resistance and violent hatred were exactly the responses that Popieluszko repeatedly counselled against in his monthly " Masses for the Homeland . " For example , on August 26 , 1984 , less than two months before his assassination , he said , " The Polish nation does not know hatred , and because of this it is capable of forgiveness . But it will forgive only in exchange for truth . Only the truth can be a condition for our trust . " The regime eventually abandoned its misguided attempt to frame Popieluszko for the explosives , or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the entire case against him was dropped as part of the general amnesty declared in July , 1984 . But here they were once again , the unproved , unsubstantiated , sordid charges , resurfacing at the trial of the priest 's murderers , right alongside the harrowing details of his autopsy  --  as if these were equivalent bits of data . By the end of the trial , the chief prosecutor , while demanding the death penalty for one of the defendants and long prison sentences for the three others , was virtually insisting that the priest had had his murder coming . " The extremist attitude of Popieluszko gave birth to an equally harmful extremism which produced the crime , " he said . The imputation of equivalence between the calm authority of Popieluszko 's witness-hearing and the frenzied , feverish violence of his murderers ' actions ended up draining the trial of the last vestiges of moral authority . According to the Washington Post 's reporter on the scene , many Poles " suspect that the attacks on Popieluszko 's memory reflect an attempt by the communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoing in the ... public prosecution of four of its own . " This may indeed be the case , but then the Jaruzelski regime has to make up its mind : either it is trying to overcome and reform the most blatant recidivist tendencies of its security apparatus or it is pandering to those veil tendencies for fear of alienating that apparatus . If the latter is what it is doing , the regime is well on its way to sacrificing any distance it might like to claim from the most thuggish methods of the security police , no matter what the immediate outcome of the trial in terms of sentences for the perpetrators . For in the final analysis it is neither Popieluszko nor his assassins who are in the docket in this case but , rather , the Jaruzelski regime itself . In this context , the bankruptcy of the proceedings was emphasized by the judges ' persistent refusal to follow up any of the threads of conspiracy beyond the four initial defendants . The basic scenario advanced by the prosecutors and accepted by the judges consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate superior , and that superior denying blame and turning it back onto the captain : a nice closed system , with no one else involved . And so everybody should get a twenty-year prison term except the captain , who , after all , was being blamed by all three of his co-defendants ; he should be given a death sentence . ( Interestingly , it was the lawyers for Popie- Iuszko 's family who pleaded for leniency for the condemned captain , noting that , contrary to the portrait being painted by the prosecutors , the murdered priest would himself have abhorred the taking of a human life . ) The trouble with that neat , clean version was that the testimony in the trial kept threatening to break free of its arbitrary contours  --  there were all kinds of loose ends pointing further up the chain of command . To give but one example , a secretary in the Interior Ministry testified to having had coffee with the captain shortly after the priest 's abduction and before the captain 's arrest , and quoted him as saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand in it but I did n't kill him . I tell you , though , I would not do it again . I do n't like inconsequential superiors who when things are going well say Do it , boys , ' but when things start to turn had say ' You are on your own . ' " Note the plural " superiors . " Several superiors were in fact referred to in the initial depositions of at least three of the defendants , but each retracted those specific references during the trial  --  a move that led some Poles to wonder if a backstage deal had been struck with the defendants before the ? trial started . One must n't be surprised if these prisoners find themselves released as part of a magnanimous general amnesty on the far side of the next series of uprisings and suppressions . As for the probable death sentence , Dawid Warszawski , one of the most perceptive of the columnists for the underground journal EDS , has noted that " there will be no way of knowing whether the sentence has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Various government spokesmen have insisted all along that the verdict in this trial would not constitute an end to the investigation of the case , but these claims were mocked in the chief prosecutor 's summation last week when he suggested that ongoing investigation might yet implicate Western " centers of subversion " in the priest 's death . He observed that such groups had benefitted from the tragedy , which had rocked Poland like no other event since the imposition of martial law . ( The indictment of the four defendants had included some farfetched conjectures along these lines . Thus , the captain was said to have once assisted in the procuring of passports for one man who ended up in West Germany and for a family that was related to someone who sixteen years ago had emigrated to Israel , although that emigre now lives in Sweden . This sort of innuendo , summoning up the perversely linked twin bogeymen of German revanchism and Zionist cosmopolitanism , has been a standard , somewhat bizarre , and decidedly ugly recurring theme in Polish Communist propaganda over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of further link in the conspiracy which most Poles were waiting to hear about . But detailed information concerning the relations of the four defendants with their superiors in the security apparatus or their patrons among hard-liners in the Polish Communist Party was precisely , the sort of revelation that the trial was designed to prevent from seeping out . So for the time being , at any rate , Jaruzelski 's regime may have succeeded in closing the books on this matter . The spreading stain of corruption has been stemmed . In some ways , Jaruzelski 's associates in the trial faced a version of the dilemma that President Nixon and his aides faced when the Watergate burglars were first brought to trial , back in January , 1973 . In both cases , government officials worked furiously to control the damage  --  to limit the scandal to its lowest possible reaches . The Polish crime was , of course , more serious , but there were other differences as well . One of them is embodied in the extraordinary rectitude and stubborn independence of Judge John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Polish counterparts . ( According to a piece in this week 's Der Spiegel , closed-circuit live television monitoring of the ongoing proceedings at the Polish trial was being piped into the nearby town hall , and then on to Party headquarters in Warsaw , with specific instructions on the conduct of the case being relayed back to the judges at each lunch break . ) Another major difference lies in the existence in the United States of an independent press with the capacity ( if not always the will ) for fierce , dogged investigative reporting  --  the kind of reporting that was championed at the time by the Washington Post . That paper 's reporters picked up just the sort of loose ends that this Polish trial has now generated in such quantity , followed those threads , and were eventually led all the way to the highest FEDKUARY 11,1985 seats of power . Such an independent and inquiring press is , naturally , absent in Poland today , but a great and troubling irony for us here in the United States is that it is just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the various libel suits  --  notably Sharon 's and Westmoreland 's  --  filling our federal dockets . The farcically outrageous denouement of the trial now concluding in Poland should not only alert us to the mendacity of certain claims advanced by Polish leaders but also warn us of the sort of stultification we could witness in our own system of justice if we choose to chill and hobble the investigative initiative of our press . ? DARRELL CABEY , nineteen , paralyzed from the waist down , and in a coma , is connected to life by a respirator . Even before he was shot by Bernhard Goetz , Darrell Cabey 's connections to life were tenuous at best so tenuous that when reports about the shooting appeared and reappeared in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , Darrell Cabey , like each of his three confederates , who were shot at the same time , though were not so critically wounded , existed only as a grim statistic . Al that one could find out about the four was that they were eighteen and nineteen years old , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived near each other in public housing in the South Bronx , and that each had a history of minor crimes , one of which  --  breaking into video games for the change  --  probably explained the screwdrivers that the police found before the four young men were taken to hospitals to be treated for their bullet wounds . Darrell Cabey had the most serious offense pending against him when he was shot  --  a charge that he had committed armed robbery . A charge and a plea of not guilty , but no disposition of the case . The public learned a lot about Bernhard Goetz : about his troubled childhood after his wealthy father pleaded guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct following the overturn of his conviction in a case involving child molesting ; about his first mugging in New York City , in which he was thrown against a glass door and suffered torn cartilage and tissue in his chest ; about his efforts to rid his Greenwich Village neighborhood of dope dealers , junkies , and assorted THE NEW YORKER other criminals . Everything that helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been victimized in one way or another all his life . The four young men he shot never really emerged as human beings , yet from the scanty information available one can infer that they , too , were victimized . High-school dropouts . Unemployed . For the most part , petty crimes . Headed for trouble of one kind or another . At least , that 's the impression that one is left with . Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward , who , like the four young men , is black , and who himself has lately been fending off critics , also did some inferring , based on his own life experience . " Having come out of the same neighborhoods that they came out of  --  and perhaps worse , since I think most of them live in housing projects , and I lived in tenement houses , and maybe in tougher neighhorhoods than theirs  --  now that I understand it , I do n't condone it , or excuse it , either , but I can understand the frustration , " he recently said to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in school with large numbers of disruptive kids and maybe running into occasional teachers who have given up and feel that the large part of their student body is unteachable , and therefore do not teach . And even when they try to teach , with the great number of disruptive students they ca n't get their message across . All of the social problems that exist in the areas where they live . Mainly the lack of jobs , and particularly the lack of jobs for teen-agers . I was a shoeshine boy after school and worked on trucks as a delivery boy for a dollar a day . Those kinds of jobs are not available for teen-agers today . A dollar  --  maybe that 's twenty dollars in today 's dollars . Maybe even more . " We asked if such things constituted the difference between somebody like him , growing up in the same circumstances and becoming Police Commissioner , and somebody like these kids , becoming perpetually involved in crime . " I think it 's more than that  --  and probably the TV camera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and did n't know I was poor . Everybody around me was poor . And I was never hopeless . My mother always worked . She was a domestic , but she always had work . There was always a job available to me after school . And everybody was in the same condition . Today , I think that what we have is ? particularly in the last four years , under this Administration in Washington , we have people who if they 're doing well probably are doing better in the last four years . And those who are doing bad  --  they 're probably doing worse . And when they look ahead they do n't see any signs of doing better . I did n't have a TV camera to know that you were doing O.K. uptown or someplace else . I guess I thought the whole world was like me . We did n't have cars . We played stickball in the street , because the cars were n't lined up in the street . We were n't as mobile as the youth are today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera and he can see that , gee , a lot of people are doing fine . They 're doin ' real good . And me  --  look at me : I got nothin ' . And they 're on the street . And if you go to the Harlems and the East New Yorks and Bed-Stuys and Bushwicks and the inner-city areas of this city , and the South Bronx , you see these young men standing on the street . Tell you another place to go and to get a shock is to go to a state prison and look down into the yard in Attica , and you see the prime of America inside of prison yards , as many as thirty-four thousand strong . Most of them under thirty years of age . Well , they 've committed crimes , and we deal with them ; we 're dealing with our social problems , with increased prison space . I opened ten prisons in the state of New York , and I think you have to have them . But it has to be a balanced approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a state prison that we might have caught at an early age and put into a training program that would have funnelled him into a job . " Darrell Cabey wo n't be funnelled into anything now , since he is connected to life only by a respirator . And the others  --  their connections to life remain as tenuous as ever , if not more so . ? ? Pageant OUR Special Inauguration Correspondent , back from several frigid days of pomp and circumstance in the nation 's capital , and now thoroughly thawed , has filed the following dispatch : Must have heard " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " at least forty-seven times . Deeply love the piece , and always get a lump in my throat ( visions of Honest Abe ) , but wish it were played with somewhat more discretion . Arrived on Friday ( two days before private swearing-in at the White 2fisea , K- House , three days before official swearing-in at the Capitol ) and settled into hotel room overlooking White House and Lafayette Park . Stunning view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Washington Monument behind . Lafayette Park another matter : chockablock with huge motor vans containing television equipment and temporary offices for broadcasting people ; a truck marked " Parst ; " a truck marked " GOURMET PRODUCTIONS  --  THE ROLLING FEAST ; " and signs reading " Liva THE BOMB , DIE BY THE BOMB , " " LOVE IS THE WAY TO WIN , " and " WANTED : WISDOM AND HONESTY . " Brief walk through eerily quiet streets . Gridlock worse than in New York . Impossible for anything to move in any direction . Heimlich maneuver obviously required . Stood for a moment at dusk outside Russian Embassy and watched stolid-looking man in dark suit sticking head out of first one Embassy window and then another , methodically closing metal shutters on windows . Embassy a huge mansion , but great metal gate in front gives one the feeling it 's an impenetrable fortress . Strange sensation , heightened by fact that Polish Solidarity flag flies directly across from Embassy , in front of headquarters of International Union of Electronic , Electrical , Technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much colder , and time to head for Ellipse and the first official Inauguration function  --  a Prelude Pageant set in the packed snow of icy park behind White House . Rigid security . Had to pass through airport-type detectors ; nearby woman 's handbag subjected to intense scrutiny  --  every item removed and examined , Bitter , biting winds as a hardy band of spectators faced a garish stage topped by an immense red-whiteand-blue eagle that bore an unkind resemblance to a Thanksgiving turkey . Many police with dogs on leashes . Sudden stir behind stage as long , dark motor cavalcade , punctuated by red motorcycle lights , swept up , having silently wheeled around from the White House . Vice-President and Mrs. Bush appeared , waved briefly , and entered glass booth to one side of stage . A moment later , President and Mrs. Reagan walked out onto stage , he bundled up in long , dark greatcoat , with white scarf , she in vivid-red coat . He has a distinctive walk  --  a rolling lope of great vigor  --  and an easy wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , was warm . I was cold , but I 'm not President . Reagan and company listened to pageant narration delivered by Fess Parker ( Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett of television ) , who left few notes in American history untouched , with heavy emphasis on Valley Forge , Bull Run , Gettysburg , settling of the West ( " Trappers and traders . Much like the films we used to make , Mr. President " ) . Clich  --  s danced in the bone-chilling night : " Storm clouds were gathering on the horizon " ( this was the Civil War ) , " The country was looking for a man in shining armor " ( this was the Depression , and the man , who has become an anomalous folk hero to the incumbent , was Franklin Delano Roosevelt ) . Songs and dancing by courageous young performers jumping up and down in red-white-and-blue costumes . Then fireworks , an immense display of sound and light , completely illuminating capital 's sky , and the President and his party , silently , almost mysteriously , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellipse . ON Saturday , hotel took on air of almost imperial importance . Security people everywhere , presumably guarding unidentified prominent guests . I noticed outside several rooms along my corridor men 's knee-length embroidered alligator boots , Texas-style , waiting to be shined . Buzz in lobby became noticeably higher . Many tall , well-turned-out , tanned men and tall , well-turned-out women waiting for stretch limousines to appear in hotel driveway . Many women garnished with wide variety of deceased animals , often floor length . Down to Capitol for vital credentials , past more of same intense security , and into cozy office of Roy L. McGhee , genial superintendent of Senate Periodical Press Gallery . Splendid credentials issued for prime seat facing Inaugural stand at west end of Capitol . Had afternoon to wander through beauties of horizontal Washington ( low buildings , vast spaces , sense of history ) . The National Gallery an extraordinary spot : so FEBRUARY 11 , 1985 many mothers wheeling children in strollers , atmosphere of accessibility so much stronger than in many museums I will not mention . Saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only one of Washington , Martha , and his stepgrandchildren painted from life , it also included , in the background , his hunting companion and Revolutionary War attendant , William ( Billy ) Lee , a black man . Washington is seated at a table examining a map of the city of Washington , and is elegant , composed , and utterly superior in appearance . Out again into cold , and followed my instinct to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial , not far from the Lincoln Memorial . My first experience of this , and a sobering , shattering one . Memorial is a triumph of abstract art , one polished black granite wall of vertical slabs sloping gently downward to form an angle with another wall , which slopes gently up again . The walls ( designed by Maya Ying Lin , of Athens , Ohio , a Yale student ) are inscribed with fifty-eight thousand and seven names of those killed in the war , and the cumulative effect of the tiny , neat etched names  --  each slab reflecting the living observers with mirror-like clarity  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many placing small floral arrangements or American flags in front of a name here , a name there . Quiet National Park Rangers and volunteers holding thick paperbound directories of the names , to facilitate locating particular persons . Many young people , bundled up against the cold , and many older people , most of them simply dressed , and always that strange silence of questing people , seeking comfort in the snow . ON Sunday , President and Vice- President sworn in at private ceremony in White House . Gave me a neighborly feeling to watch ceremony on a set in my room and , at the same time , look out upon White House itself . Distinctive feeling of reality intermingled with make-believe . President and Vice-President were to make a brief appearance outside , on North Portico ( the one I was facing ) , a moment after the swearing-in , but a large white wall had been erected in front of portico , so there were the two men on the portico on the set , but no sight of them when I glanced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formations , temperature in low teens . THE . NEW YOR.KEK Streets deserted . Down to National Air and Space Museum to hear Red Clay Ramblers in an Inaugural concert . Ramblers an Appalachian string band with banjo , guitar , harmonica , fiddle , bass , piano . Museum totally jammed ( over ten million visit it each year ) , mostly with young people carrying packs , many of whom were curled in corners , their packs beside them . Outside , through huge windows , snow swirling madly across Mall , Almost every young person 's jacket had a legend on the back : " Avengers , " " Crusaders , " " Percussion . " To one side of Ramblers , stretching vertically into upper reaches of museum , rose grim reminders of past , Hitler 's V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket ; next to them were two space capsules joined nose to nose  --  the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project , common docking system of 1975 exchange in space between the two superpowers ( quiet symbols of hope ) . " Oh , how I wish 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls in Peoria , " sang Ramblers . MONDAY , day of official outdoor swearing-in . Early-morning temperature four degrees below zero , Fahrenheit . All outdoor tickets declared invalid . Disappointing . Went outside hotel to watch President Reagan arrive for prayer service at St. John 's Church , across from Lafayette Park . Most elaborate security . Handheld metal detector pressed against my coat and under my arms as I stood and watched Presidential party arrive : motorcycles , police cars , long black limousines , then limousine with Presidential seal , then open Secret Service car , then more motorcycles and police , and an ambulance . The President , hatless , strode into church . " I 'm glad lie 's praying , " said man next to me . Sudden word from friend McGhee that a ticket available for me in the Rotunda . Wild taxi ride to Capitol . Was stopped by police and Secret Service near foot of Capitol Hill , stopped by police and Secret Service at top of Capitol Hill , but tightly clutched tickets previously issued got me inside building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly a sight . Rotunda is enormous  --  nearly a hundred feet across , more than a hundred and eighty feet high  --  with sandstone walls , sandstone floor , classic frieze circling entire room high up , and , higher still , at tip-top , an allegorical painting depicting General Washington ( dim in the distance ) seated between Liberty and Victory and in close proximity to Arts , ? Sciences , Commerce , and Agriculture . Sun streamed in through windows in huge dome . Floor of Rotunda solidly packed with members of Congress , diplomats , Supreme Court , Marine Band ( blazing-red jackets ) , Cabinet members . A small platform had been erected near center of Rotunda , with a lectern for use of the President . At very center of Rotunda , over a white marble disc in the floor , twenty-six Americans have lain in state , including Abraham Lincoln , the Unknown Soldier , John F. Kennedy , and Hubert H. Humphrey . Did n't have much chance to think about past , although past was everywhere . Hand of Marine Band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , his hand moved , and " Hail to the Chief " boomed through the hall . The acoustics were perfect , the moment solemn . The President entered with his usual brisk walk . Dressed in a dark-blue ? suit , the inevitable white handkerchief in his jacket pocket . The oath of office was quietly administered by a dark-robed and intensely white-maned Chief Justice Burger . The President , without a teleprompter , and in subdued , almost intimate tones , began his address . Behind him were his family and Cabinet , before him the representatives of the people . Facing him were huge murals of Washington resigning his commission , Cornwallis surrendering at Yorktown . The President seemed deeply affected by the unexpected indoor surroundings . He spoke conversationally , unpretentiously . He talked of " the American sound  --  hopeful , bighearted , idealistic , daring , decent , and fair . " Prayers , " Hail to the Chief , " and the President was gone  --  to lunch and four more years . I , too , said a small prayer  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
