Fortunately , the guest pretended to take no notice of what Qing had said ; the yellow wintersweet in a large vase seemed to have attracted her attention . Qing was not discouraged at all . As the only child of the family , she thought it very exciting to have a visitor to talk to. // ' ' That is my grandma ' s favorite flow-er , ' ' she went on , not giving me an opportunity to show my hospitality. // // ' ' My grandma likes beautiful things . She used to be very beautiful herself . Would you like to see her pictures ? ' ' Without waiting for an answer , my daughter ran out of the living room and returned with a photograph album in her arms . The guest was delighted to see my daughter ' s eagerness . She took the album and turned to the first page , to my mother ' s wedding picture. // ' ' Doesn ' t she look like a film star ! ' ' Qing exclaimed . Since it was a black-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture could not show . ' ' My grandma was wearing a red silk dress . Her wedding cloak was made of white transparent gauze . Look at her pearl necklace . She used to have many jewels. ' ' // Qing began to turn over the leaves of the album rapidly , trying to show the guest the various jewels my mother was wearing in those pictures - gold ear-rings , jade bracelets , silver hairpins , and diamond rings . Qing was always proud of the beauty of my mother in the pictures taken in her early years. // Qing was very familiar with the pictures , which were arranged in chrono-logical order . She stopped halfway through the album and said disappoint-edly , ' ' Now from this page on , you will not see her wearing jewels anymore . ' ' The picture on this page was taken in 1962 . In the picture my father and mother were surrounded by their seven children. // ' ' My grandma ' s eyes look smaller . Her face is smaller , too . She ' s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewels , ' ' Qing continued explaining , but this time she was unable to explain what the picture could not show . She turned to me , ' ' Mom , why didn ' t Grandma wear her jewels in this picture ? ' ' // ' ' Because she was old , ' ' I answered. // ' ' Then why didn ' t she give them to you ? ' ' // ' ' She did. ' ' // Excited , Qing asked , ' ' Where are they ? ' ' // I did not answer her question , although I knew where the jewels were ; they were here , in my body , in my blood. // Staring at the picture , I let my thoughts run back to the years from 1959 to 1962 , when the whole of China suffered from serious natural disasters . I lived with my mother and my younger brother at our home in Shanghai . My father was away teaching in the suburbs of Shanghai , and all of my elder brothers and sisters were living elsewhere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after having graduated from college. // At that time everything was rationed , from matches to soap , from sugar to rice . Extra food was available only at very high prices , sometimes 10 times higher than normal . One day , my mother was in the kitchen , staring at a cabbage that looked stale . I thought she was going to fix our supper. // ' ' Yen , ' ' she said , turning to me , ' ' why don ' t you go to the Russian restaurant to eat ? ' ' // What a good idea , I thought . We had not been in a restaurant for a long time . In those days , dining out was a luxury to most people. // ' ' OK , ' ' I answered , ' ' let ' s go. ' ' // ' ' Oh , no . I ' m not going , ' ' Mother said gently . ' ' You know ' The Red Chamber ' will be on the Peking Opera radio broadcast at 6 . I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was a keen radio listener . So I took my younger brother to dine in the restaurant at the corner of the street . The beef soup with onions and potatoes smelled good , and the brown steak with red tomato sauce on a white plate was a pleasant sight to look at. // When we returned home , both my brother and I gave Mother a glowing report . ' ' It was so delicious ! ' ' I declared . Mother smiled happily at our detailed description of the food. // ' ' What did you have for supper , Mom ? ' ' I asked // ' ' Something delicious , ' ' she quickly answered , then immediately started telling us about the opera broadcast over the radio : how the people in power in Jia ' s family played a trick on Bao Yu to impose an unwanted marriage on him . Mother ' s vivid description of the story , her admiration of the excellent wording of the lines of the play , and her praise of the touching music took us into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my intense interest in food. // For a whole week , the smell of cabbage soup hung in the air of our apartment during our lunch and supper times . But the smell was not so unbearable because of my mother ' s pleasant talk at the table . I felt grateful to have rice to go with cabbage soup when my mother told us that in some places people had nothing to eat at all . Once in a while Mother would fry eggs for us , but at such times she would always be too busy in the kitchen to eat with us. // One day my brother asked , ' ' Mom , when can we have dinner in the Russian restaurant again ? ' ' // ' ' It is too much to dine out once a week , ' ' I said , giving him a warning glance . He was too young to understand the situation , I thought . Mother drew me to her and held me tight . After a little while , she raised her eyes and said , ' ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that. ' ' // I looked at Mother carefully ; now she was smiling , and I was convinced . Then Mother patted my brother on the head and said , ' ' Go to the restaurant with your sister tonight . ' ' My brother was delighted and so was I. Again , Mother could not go with us because of her radio program. // From that time on , my brother and I would go once a week , under the tall trees standing along the roadside , to the restaurant at the corner to have dinner . Mother never went with us ; I assumed that she enjoyed art more than food . I can not remember how many times I saw new green leaves break forth from old trunks when we went to the restaurant , and I can not remember how many times I saw Mother bending over her needlework when we got home from the restaurant. // Mother was always busy tailoring her clothes to fit , always taking them in ; year after year everything looked large on her. // In 1962 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That summer I passed the national university exam and was accepted by the East China Normal University . The whole family was proud of me because the number of students the universities were allowed to accept had never been so low . More important , my composition for the exam was published in the major Shanghai newspaper . So Mother decided to take the whole family to the photographic studio to have a formal picture taken . Humming happily , I went to one of her trunks , where she used to keep her jewelry box . Since all of our social activities had been reduced to the minimum , I had not seen Mother wear jewels for years . But on this occasion , I was sure she would like to wear something special. // At the bottom of the trunk lay the pretty jewelry box , a black lacquerware inlaid with golden flowers . ' ' I ' ll choose that gem brooch , ' ' I thought . I remembered how beautiful my mother looked when she wore it . Delightedly I opened the box . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box was empty ! And all of a sudden , the brown steak , the beef soup , and the fried eggs came to my mind . My eyes blurred . I could see nothing but my mother ' s figure bending over her clothes , sewing. // With a heavy heart , I went to the photographic studio with my family . While the photographer was directing lights on us , I turned around to see my mother . Although her eyes were sunken and her chin had sharpened , her smile was still beautiful , the same beautiful smile I saw on her face when she sent us to the restaurant , when she gave my brothers their tuition , and when she paid for my sisters ' winter coats . I turned back to the camera and smiled . I smiled for the beauty of my mother. // ' ' Mom , where are Grandma ' s jewels ? ' ' My daughter ' s voice awakened me from my reverie . To answer her question , I moved my finger to the picture , touching the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Here they are. ' ' // Qing was amused . ' ' My uncles and aunts and you are Grandma ' s jewels ? ' ' She giggled and turned to the guest . ' ' Isn ' t my mom funny ? ' ' // The guest gave me an understanding smile and took Qing on her knees . I did not follow the guest ' s eyes to the beautiful wintersweet in the large vase . I heard my mother ' s approaching footsteps . The living room was filled with a sweet fragrance. // //
