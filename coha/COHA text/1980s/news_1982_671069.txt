While call-in shows have been around for a long time , " Hotline , " on WRKO ( AM 68 ) , is addressed to a specific audience - the listener who is single . Callers go on the air , live but anonymously , to talk about themselves , their interests and the sort of person they would like to meet . Other callers may ask for the given names and telephone numbers. // In its first week last October " Hotline " received some 6 , 000 calls . Now , it routinely gets 40 , 000 calls in four hours , from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. every Saturday , when the show is on the air , although the station can handle only about 1 percent of them . " Hotline " has been featured on local television shows and in the newspapers , the subject of grudging admiration for the tasteful fashion in which it handles a potentially controversial topic. // According to Dick Syatt , the " Hotline " host ; Robert Fish , vice president and general manager of WRKO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received were from participants asking to be removed from the list because they had been deluged with calls. // " Boston is a rare city with so many young people and colleges , " observed Jerry del Coliano , editor and publisher of Inside Radio , the radio trade publication . " Elsewhere there may be more risks . It ' s difficult to do such a show because it might offend the community . " The single population aged 20 years and over in Massachussets is roughly similar to that in New York , about 47 percent of the total. // The format is the creation of Mr. Syatt , a fast-talking man who pioneered the program in Dallas five years ago . He then took it to Providence , R.I. , where it still runs . " At first I thought it was just a cute idea , " he said . " Now I think it really fills a need.

" Of course , we have no way of knowing , " Mr. Syatt acknowledged . " But I ' m not a yenta and we ' re not a dating service . We don ' t match people . We just give out phone numbers that have been given us of people ' s own free will. " // On a recent Saturday one caller was a 34-year-old woman in " human services " who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and confessed to being 15 pounds overweight . " Being tall ' s a problem , " she told Mr. Syatt , adding that she wanted someone with a sense of humor ready to make a commitment .

" Everyone wants someone honest and sincere , " Mr. Syatt reported , " and because everyone wants it I assume no one has found it. " // Most callers say they shun bars and singles clubs , noting that a long telephone conversation can be revealing while diminishing risks . " If you do get a weirdo I think it would show up on the phone , " said Val , a 34-year-old freelance writer . " You talk about your interests and things you like around the city , and you ' ve got a pretty good idea of where the person comes from.

" I ' m considering asking to be taken off the list , " said Christine , a 28-year-old bookkeeper who has had " tons " of calls , including an obscene one and calls from a pest . " Of the gentlemen I did meet a few were very nice , " she said . " One I ' ve developed a serious relationship with.

" // Newly single himself after seven years of marriage , Mr. Syatt says he would never date someone from the show for fear of possible criticism . " Perhaps some of the appeal comes from the fact I ' m single myself , " he said . " Now I really relate to how difficult it is to meet people . " What differentiates the show from dating services , he added , is that he has no direct personal or financial involvement . " I ' m a talk-show host , " he insisted. // " When I started there were a lot of skeptics , " he recalled . " I guess it sounds bizarre , but people are calling back because it works.

" This program serves a need and that ' s the essence of good broadcasting. " //
