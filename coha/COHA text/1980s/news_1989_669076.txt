Kim Long wears a pink button-down-collar shirt , which might be trendy if it were pressed . But as it is , it ' s rumpled . It looks as if he fell asleep on one side of his chest and creased in a line to his waist . His blue jeans are faded from too much wear-not the more stylish stonewash . As for his lifestyle : " The only thing I do now that ' s a bona fide trend is fly fishing , " he says . " But I ' ve been doing it most of my life , so it doesn ' t count . " Long might as well be Billy Graham declaring he ' s not into religion or Famous Amos saying he hates chocolate chip cookies . As the author of American Forecaster Almanac , it ' s his job to spot trends . Will hats make a comeback ? Will soft cookies disappear ? Will " thirtysomething " tune in or turn off Baby Boomers everywhere ? Every year , Long makes predictions like these . Over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent accurate . In the process , he ' s become hot himself . " One newspaper called me the guru of trends , " says Long . " The National Enquirer claimed I was the foremost trend watcher in the United States . " He chuckles at the dubious distinction . He ' s been on " Today " and " Geraldo . " He ' s been interviewed by so many radio talk-show hosts he can pick up the phone from his bed at 4 a. m . , East Coast drive time , make his predictions and go right back to sleep . " I rarely even remember doing them , " he says . " I ' ve created this monster , " he chuckles . " But it ' s a benevolent monster . " Somehow , it computes Long , 40 , lives and works behind a rundown door on Denver ' s Ogden Street , marked only with a number , a peephole and a mail slot . Inside , two computers are his only concession to trendy gadgetry . An old 10-speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A couple of " Nobody for President " bumper stickers-remnants of his hippie days-decorate another . When he talks , he sounds more like a sociology professor than hipster . Mention housing , for instance , and he ' ll go into a long monologue about shrinking lot sizes and the growing use of exercise equipment in bedrooms . When he calls himself a cynic , he adds : " That ' s a trend . The David Letterman syndrome . " His informal lessons are based on hours of research . Long spends most of his time reading . He regularly browses through the Statistical Abstract of the United States or trade publications such as American Handyman , which often talk about industry plans for the future . When necessary , he also does grueling original research-analyzing pin-up calendars , for example , to study the American blond . " Nine girls out of 12 ( on the pin-up calendars ) tend to be blond , " he says . " Since only 15 percent of women in the U.S. are naturally blond , some of these women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long calls himself a journalist , not a futurist . For years , he co-authored the successful Daily Planet Almanac , a counterculture alternative to the Farmer ' s Almanac that included such items as how to cook soybeans or make LSD . The almanac doubled circulation every year for the first four years , peaking at 100 , 000 copies sold in 1984 . But " people change ; we changed , " says Long of the now-defunct book . The American Forecaster , in its seventh year , takes its place as Long ' s yearly task . Long also writes a chapter for the Farmer ' s Almanac each year . He ' s produced a moon calendar , which shows the moon ' s fullness every day of the year ; a trout almanac , with seasonal information about trout fishing ; a book called " Kicking the Bucket , " about the strange ways people die . In addition , he pens a trend column for a magazine in Japan called Spy , no relation to the trendy New York publication . He ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to fax his first article , for example , he demurred . He didn ' t have a fax machine , he explained . " She said , But you trend watcher ! You very trendy guy . " He said no , he was old-fashioned . Even so , the day of his deadline , he borrowed a friend ' s fax machine . " She thought that was hysterical , " he says . " She said , Oh-ho , now you fax ! ' " He ' s just not interested in following the crowd , he says . In his job , he says , " it helps to be somewhat non-biased to flash . " But many people can ' t resist . Last year , if his predictions were correct , Americans suffered midlife crises en masse , bought lullaby tapes en masse , jumped on snowboards en masse . " I don ' t think we ' re raised to be sheep , " he says . There ' s simply a sheepish component to living in a large society in groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help occasionally poking fun at that fact . During the filming of one TV show , his interviewer asked him to reveal a trend to the audience . " I told him I couldn ' t think of anything new and different , but if he didn ' t mind , I ' d make one up , " says Long with a grin . He thought up something outrageous . Health nuts in California , he said , were jogging backward . It wasn ' t long before his off-the-wall fantasy became off-the-wall fact , with its own trendy label : " retro-running . " The man who doesn ' t own a microwave oven , drives a Ford truck and recently bought a VCR but hasn ' t used it yet , grins knowingly . It was bound to happen . " You really can ' t come up with something the consumer isn ' t going to do , " he says . " The more ironic you try to be , the weirder you get , the more likely it is to come true .
