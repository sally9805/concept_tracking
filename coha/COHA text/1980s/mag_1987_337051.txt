" There 's gunfire on board . . . We 're going down . " <P> The distress call came from Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 halfway on its run from Los Angeles to San Francisco , flying at 22,000 ft . Two minutes later , the British Aerospace commuter jet shrieked toward earth in a nearly vertical dive and disintegrated as it slammed into a hill near Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County . All 43 aboard were killed , including four executives of Chevron Corp . From that baffling beginning , other messages gradually unraveled the mystery of what had happened . <P> " Jackie , this is David . I 'm on my way to San Francisco , Flight 1771 . I love you . I really wish I could say more , but I do love you . " <P> The message on the answering machine of USAir Ticket Agent Jacqueline Camacho in Los Angeles was from her estranged boyfriend . David Burke , 35 , was also a USAir agent , who had been fired on Nov. 19 after he was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Born in Britain of Jamaican parents , Burke had never married but had fathered seven children by four women . After his dismissal , he turned moody and violent . He had held Camacho and her six-year-old daughter at gunpoint on a forced six-hour auto drive the previous Friday , and he seemed particularly bitter toward the boss who fired him : Raymond Thomson , 48 , the USAir customer-service manager in Los Angeles . Thomson commuted regularly by air from his Tiburon home in San Francisco Bay . <P> " David Burke had been allowed to bypass security screening as a familiar airlines employee . " <P> That was how an FBI affidavit described Burke 's boarding of Flight 1771 after purchasing a one-way ticket . Thomson , heading home , got on the same plane . <P> " We 've got a problem here , " said a voice on the cockpit tape recorder recovered at the crash site . Then came other , more ominous sounds . <P> The tape had recorded gunshots , then the sound of pounding on the cockpit door and what the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was followed by scuffling and shouts in what one investigator described as " a terrible commotion . " Finally came a high whine , presumably created by air rushing out of the pressurized cockpit through a bullet hole in a window or wall . Patricia Goldman , head of the National Transportation Safety Board 's on-site investigators , said they could find " no apparent problems with the aircraft , frame , structure or engines " that would have led to the crash . Other investigators suggested that both the pilot and copilot had probably been shot . An inert body , slumped against the controls , could throw the plane into a dive . <P> " There is evidence to believe that David Burke was involved in the destruction of PSA Flight 1771 . " <P> That statement from the FBI affidavit was based on evidence found by the probers who picked over the muddy hillside . The grisly discoveries : one of Burke 's thumbs , identified by its print , proving he had boarded the flight , and a Smith and Wesson .44 magnum revolver with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said Burke had borrowed the gun from him last month . Most incriminating was a note , written in Burke 's hand , on the outside of an air-sickness bag . It read : <P> " Hi , Ray . I think it 's sort of ironical that we end up like this . I asked for some leniency for my family , remember . Well I got none . And you 'll get none . "
