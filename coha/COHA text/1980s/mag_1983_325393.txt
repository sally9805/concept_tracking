With the 1984 elections still 19 months away , the quadrennial chorus of complaints about the ever earlier start of presidential campaigns again fills the air . But short campaigns are no longer possible , in the view of Washington Bureau Chief Robert Ajemian , who has reported on presidential politicking since 1956 , first for LIFE , then for TIME . " Since 1972 , " he says , " we have reformed the electoral process , opened it up to more voters . For the candidate , this means in-person , retail politics , drawing voters in , confronting them in primaries , winning over delegates . That takes time . For the voter , sizing up the candidates also takes time : figuring out how they think and decide , their intelligence , temperament , imagination . " At the same time , notes Ajemian , " because public life is so battering these days , a candidate 's psychological armor has to be very thick . As a result , political image making has reached new levels of skill and manipulation , emphasizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to identify both the candidate and the real person . We ca n't learn too much about future Presidents . " <P> To that end , TIME this week begins a series of profiles on the leading presidential candidates , declared and not yet announced . " Our aim , " says Ajemian , " is not to tell how they stack up , one vs. another , but to learn what motivates them , to try to peer through the psychological cover that politicians wear so well and sense , as best we can , the essence of these men . " <P> TIME will attempt to uncover and explain these facets of the candidates , beginning in this issue with the current Democratic front runner , former Vice President Walter Mondale . Ajemian followed Mondale around the capital and on the road , listening to his speeches and interviewing him several times on the move and at Mondale 's home in Washington . He talked with dozens of people who had known and worked with Mondale , some as far back as 25 years ago in Minnesota . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former Vice President was his willingness to take unpopular stands . <P> Says Ajemian : " People would invariably tell me , ' Fritz is a beautiful human being , but I really do n't know if he 's tough enough for that job . ' " Ajemian 's assessment of Mondale 's strengths and weaknesses offers TIME 'S readers an early opportunity to begin that essential citizen responsibility of making up their own minds .
