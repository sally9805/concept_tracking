John Block confirmed Friday on his last day as secretary of agriculture that he has accepted a job as president of the National-American Wholesale Grocers Association , a trade group based in suburban Falls Church , Va . Speaking to reporters at a news conference here , Block said : " I ' m happy to stay in Washington and I ' m happy to be going into a job that will , I believe , give me a chance to continue to work with a lot of the contacts I ' ve already established . " Block announced his resignation from the Cabinet last month but said at the time that he was undecided on which job offer to accept . As president of the 80-year-old trade group , Block will be in charge of an organization of 300 wholesalers with distribution centers at 750 points . In addition to supplying grocery stores , the association provides food for such outlets as restaurants , hospitals and schools as well as lobbying for legislation on Capitol Hill . Block said he would not be involved in lobbying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in tax legislation and obtaining what he called reasonable transportation rates for wholesalers . He said he will begin his new job Monday , which is observed by federal employees as George Washington ' s birthday . " Now that I ' ve done a little review , I find that we work Monday in the new job and the government doesn ' t , " Block joked . " The first mistake I made was starting Monday . " As secretary of agriculture for five years , Block presided over one of the worst farm crises since the Depression , with land values collapsing , exports falling and the federal government reducing large farm subsidies and financing to farmers . In one of his last acts after helping win passage of a new farm bill , Block slashed federal price supports for the 1986 corn and wheat crops by 25 to 30 percent , the maximum allowable under the new law . President Reagan , in accepting Block ' s resignation last month , said , " Yours has been a challenging assignment and you ' ve handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he felt the farm crisis had about bottomed out , but made no prediction about when there will be an upturn . He also said that his designated successor and former deputy , Richard Lyng , will continue many of his farm policies . Lyng , who is awaiting Senate confirmation , served as director of agriculture in California when Reagan was governor . Although Block ' s new salary was not announced , his move to the private sector is expected to provide considerably more than his $86 , 200 annual federal income . After experiencing farm losses as a result of some of the very programs he presided over as a Cabinet member , Block announced last year that his assets had declined by 50 percent . At his confirmation hearings in 1981 , he estimated his debts at $3 million to $5 million . Before joining the administration , Block , a hog farmer from Gilson , near Galesburg , Ill. , served as director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture . Now that he is out of office , Block said he expects to make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to leave the running of the farm to his son.
