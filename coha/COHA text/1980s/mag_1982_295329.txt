The Haig-Weinberger disputes overshadow their views in common <P> Once again President Ronald Reagan was under pressure to convince skeptics that his Administration has only one , consistent foreign policy . And the reason he needed to dispel doubts was a disturbingly familiar one : seemingly contradictory statements put forward by Secretary of State Alexander Haig , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and their spokesmen . First , the President last week dashed off a " Dear Menachem " letter to Prime Minister Begin , reassuring Israel 's leader that there had been no cooling of U.S. friendship toward his country , no matter what impression Begin might have got from Weinberger 's trip to Arab countries the week before . Two days later , at a White House press conference , Reagan complained about " overblown " reports from that tour , and insisted that " there is no difference in policy between " Weinberger and Haig . <P> Reagan was partly right-and partly wrong . While the two Cabinet Secretaries agree on certain broad policy goals , there has been a long series of disagreements between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without a strong hand at the controls of the National Security Council , the White House has allowed the competition to ripen . Indeed , Weinberger has been " committing foreign policy , " as he puts it , more vigorously than any Secretary of Defense since Robert McNamara two decades ago . The dissonance between Weinberger 's generally hawkish views and the usually more moderate approach of Haig has sown doubt about the U.S. approach toward countries ranging from El Salvador to Poland , and nowhere more so than in the ever volatile Middle East . <P> The latest dustup began when reporters aboard the Boeing 707 that flew Weinberger to Saudi Arabia , Oman and Jordan filed stories quoting a Pentagon official as saying that Weinberger wanted to " redirect " American military assistance away from Israel toward the Arabs . As soon as this appeared in print , another spokesman insisted that the message had been garbled ; Weinberger wanted only to " redirect " U.S.-assisted Arab military efforts toward countering internal subversion , as well as potential Soviet threats . But suspicion was inevitably aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an enemy " because of his alleged pro-Arab views . ( Haig , in contrast , is regarded by Israeli officials as a good friend . ) <P> Weinberger said little until his plane reached the Jordanian capital of Amman . But then he declared that he " favors " the sale of U.S. mobile Hawk antiaircraft missiles and F-16 fighters to Jordan . The Israelis were aghast at the prospect of these weapons in the hands of an unfriendly state that has rejected all overtures to join the Camp David peace process . Haig , returning to the U.S. from a trip to Portugal , Spain , Morocco , and Rumania , just as Weinberger was getting back from Amman , hastened to assert that " there was no specific request from Jordan for U.S. arms , no offer made and no decision made of any kind . " He added that " redirect " was " a very incorrect word " to describe U.S. policy toward the Middle East , however it had come to be used .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
