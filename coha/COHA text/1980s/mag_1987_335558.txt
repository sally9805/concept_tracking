Eleven years ago , when he was eight and she was turning seven , they practiced together , two West German children from the neighboring towns of Leimen and Bruehl , near Heidelberg . Playing tennis with a girl , and a younger girl at that , might have caused him the usual , expected , masculine , chauvinistic , German amount of embarrassment , except for one thing . " She could hit it , " he whistles . " I was not as good as the good boys , and so I had to practice with the best girls . She was the best girl . " Smiles come easily to Boris Becker , especially when the discussion includes Wimbledon . But he glows like a pumpkin at the recollection of those early rallies with Steffi Graf . Now they are both on the last ledge before the peak . " Two kids , " he says , " from the same area , who practiced together at twelve . . . ten . . . eight . Is n't it a little incredible ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England Lawn Tennis Club , where Becker will try to become the third-youngest singles champion of the century . Already the first and second youngest ever to do it , he points out , " I was born there , you know . " Two summers ago , unseeded and 17 , not to mention " very slow and fat , " Becker dispatched one eminent adult after another with a crashing service and a somersaulting exuberance . They all left the grounds , Henri Leconte after Tim Mayotte , predicting two things : that Becker would be a fine player one day and that he would lose in the next round . <P> " I did n't know what I was doing , " he admits . " In my mind , I was playing a little tennis tournament back in Leimen . " But he won his second Wimbledon last year with full knowledge of the benefits and the costs . " It 's no pressure coming back for the third . I ca n't promise I will win again , but I can promise I will enjoy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me there anymore . Years from now , I think I 'll walk onto the property and smile . " <P> When he won the first time , Becker was a playful puppy with huge paws . Since then he has grown 2 in. in height , to 6 ft. 3 in. , and a regimen of running has slimmed his legs and streamlined his carriage . " I have become an athlete , " he says , resembling a basketball guard . " I 'm not Dr. J , but I can dunk a basketball , just barely dunk it . Picking up a ball , any kind of ball , I always had a feeling for it . I knew how to handle it . I liked it . " As Becker has grown physically , a part of his original appeal has diminished . Last week , vaulting the net after winning the Stella Artois at Queens Club , he placed his arm about Jimmy Connors ' shoulders and positively dwarfed him . On tough points in the past , Becker has been inclined to rear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect is somehow unseemly now for the most powerful stallion in the herd .
