Although he hardly wants for honors ( three National Book Awards , the Nobel Prize for Literature ) , Saul Bellow has not always been appreciated for his comic gifts . That may be because his books and reputation can appear so intimidating . When a serious , renowned writer tosses out big ideas , the proper response seems to be a hushed , respectful concentration . But at least as far back as Herzog ( 1964 ) , Bellow began putting the act of thinking through some antic paces . Moses Herzog was the first , but not the last , of the author 's heroes to suffer the risible torments of the hypereducated man . Notable among these is the discovery that life in 20th century America has a few tricks up its sleeve that are not covered by the grand panoply of Western culture . It is possible , in such cases , to know nearly everything and nothing at all . <P> Despite its cheerless title , More Die of Heartbreak is a consistently funny variation on the theme of intellectual haplessness .

Raised in Paris by expatriate American parents , Kenneth has come back to the U.S. to be near his maternal uncle Benn Crader , a man in his 50s and an eminent botanist , revered by fellow specialists for his work on Arctic lichens . Kenneth 's obsession with Benn stems from a conviction that " you have no reason to exist unless you believe you can make your life a turning point . A turning point for everybody  --  for humankind . " The nephew feels his uncle has single-mindedly pursued such a path and might be an appropriate guide : " I thought , Would it be possible to bring to the human world what Uncle brought to plant life ?

But Benn has assets he has absentmindedly forgotten : an uncle of his , a notable crook in the disintegrating local Democratic machine , once bilked him and Kenneth 's mother out of huge proceeds from the sale of family property . Dr. Layamon tells Benn man to man : " Well , as you will have figured , with a brain like yours , the object is to recover money from Uncle Harold . That 's the overall game plan . " From the sidelines , Kenneth comments bitterly , " Basically , he did n't even want what they wanted  --  the money . As many dollar bills as it would take to fill the Grand Canyon would n't have been enough for them . Plant morphology satisfied him . So how were they to understand one another ?
