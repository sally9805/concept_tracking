Arrests made in Sentry heist <P> Like many New Yorkers tired of winter , Cristos Potamitis , 25 , a former security guard for the Bronx-based Sentry Armored Car Courier Co. , went to Puerto Rico late last month for a vacation . What he got instead was a surprise . While sunning himself by the pool at the Holiday Inn in San Juan last week , he was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly stealing $11 million-widely regarded as the largest cash heist in U.S. history-from his former employer . Potamitis , who was on duty at Sentry on Dec. 12 , 1982 , the night of the robbery , claimed he had been overpowered by two men in ski masks during the heist . His alleged accomplices , George Legakis , 21 , a part-time cook in a Queens diner , Demetrios Popadakos , 35 , and Eddie Argitakos , 24 , were also arrested and charged with bank larceny . The $11 million is still missing , but authorities said they were " optimistic " about recovering it .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
