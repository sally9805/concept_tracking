Charging into a crowd of several thousand protesting students one night last week in the huge square in front of the Bank of Korea , a unit of 80 riot police suddenly found themselves cut off from reinforcements . A sea of chanting demonstrators quickly surrounded the police , who had already used up their supplies of pepper gas , a concentrated and particularly painful form of tear gas . Outnumbered and overwhelmed , the police , many of them young conscripts , knelt in terror behind their riot shields , trying to fend off a torrent of rocks and gas canisters thrown by the students . The protesters began beating the police , then confiscating shields , helmets and other equipment . As the police were finally escorted to safety by student leaders , the crowd set fire to two piles of the collected gear . <P> The scene was rich in symbolism : instruments of authoritarian control put to the torch , while their former wielders cowered in fear . Was it , spectators may have wondered , a preview of South Korea 's future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy of defiant marches and demonstrations to protest the six-year rule of President Chun Doo Hwan . Night after night they battled with tens of thousands of police , militia and plainclothes officers , who sought to break up the crowds with judo punches , shields and the virulent pepper gas , whose acrid fumes lingered for hours over the scenes of combat . <P> As the week of violence wore on , more than two dozen police outposts were reportedly destroyed or damaged , and hundreds of people on both sides were injured . On Friday a policeman died after being run over by a commandeered bus in the central city of Taejon . A student in Seoul was in a coma , near death , after being struck in the head by a rifle-fired gas canister . In a country where student-led protests have become a tradition , last week 's disturbances were the most serious in seven years . <P> The latest wave of demonstrations broke out two weeks ago to protest the selection of Roh Tae Woo , chairman of the ruling Democratic Justice Party , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later this year . But in contrast to the first disturbances , which involved only a few thousand students and were primarily limited to Seoul , the capital , last week 's demonstrations drew crowds as large as 50,000 and flared in more than two dozen cities . In the southern port of Pusan , according to some reports , protesters burned five municipal buses and seized a garbage truck as a makeshift barricade . In Taejon a crowd of 6,000 marchers fire-bombed two police stations . On Wednesday night alone , crowds laid siege to 17 police outposts , two Democratic Justice Party district offices , and two buildings of the state-run Korean Broadcasting System .
