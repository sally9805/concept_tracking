Jurors at the trial of Victor Lopez were troubled by a major discrepancy . Lopez , charged with sexually assaulting three New York women , is a light- skinned Hispanic , yet each of the women had told police that her assailant was black . Was he , as his attorney insisted , a victim of mistaken identity ? No , concluded a jury in Queens , N.Y. , last week ; it found Lopez guilty of all three attacks . <P> Billy Lewis Glover Jr . had been tried twice for rape , but both Dallas proceedings had ended in mistrials . Earlier this month a third jury took just 22 min. to return the verdict  --  guilty . <P> The pivotal evidence was the same in both cases : results from a new forensic test , known as DNA , or genetic , " fingerprinting , " which can specifically match a suspect to genetic material in blood , hair or semen left at the scene of a crime . Hailed as the single greatest forensic breakthrough since the advent of fingerprinting at the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with growing frequency in the nation 's courtrooms . Orlando prosecutors scored the first conviction in the U.S. based on DNA typing just last November in a rape trial ; since then it has figured prominently in more than 150 cases in eleven states . <P> Advocates claim the test will revolutionize the investigation of violent crimes , from rapes and homicides to armed robberies . It also promises to resolve questions of kinship , a matter of import in child-support and immigration disputes , and will provide a reliable new means of identifying human remains . <P> In more than 1 million criminal incidents each year , suspects are not even arrested because evidence is too weak . " With DNA printing , " boasts Robert Shaler of Lifecodes in Valhalla , N.Y. , one of three U.S. companies that offer the analysis , " police will now be able to say with certainty , ' That 's the guy , ' instead of ' That could be the guy . ' " <P> Older biochemical tools , which have progressed from simple blood typing to analyzing specific enzymes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of such methods , the chance of making a matching error is one in 1,000 . DNA , however , is unique for each individual , and a matchup between a crime-scene sample and material obtained from the accused ( usually in a blood sample ) is virtually unassailable , say experts . Declares John Huss of Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown , Md. , another DNA-testing firm : " Except for identical twins , one in 4 trillion or 5 trillion people might share the same genetic fingerprint . " <P> The technique not only helps place the suspect at the scene of the crime , but can also suggest what he or she was doing there . " One may have some plausible explanation for fingerprints , " explains Timothy Berry , a prosecutor in Orlando . " But blood , semen , uprooted hair , skin under the fingernails of the victim are something else . " The information can be so damning that it precipitates a confession . In Tacoma last December , a bus driver pleaded guilty to rape , although the victim , a 57-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . DNA analysis established that semen on the woman 's undergarments belonged to the accused . On the other hand , genetic fingerprinting can be equally powerful in establishing a suspect 's innocence .
