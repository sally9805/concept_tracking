Congress may shoot it down , but Reagan sends ft up <P> When the Reagan Administration proposed selling some $5 billion worth of air weaponry , including five highly sophisticated Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) aircraft , to Saudi Arabia last April , there was little doubt that opposition might be strong enough in Congress to veto the deal . Republican Senators Howard Baker of Tennessee and Paul Laxalt of Nevada advised the President to delay official notification of his intent to make the sale until he had enough votes lined up to support the package . Reagan waited , and last week sent that notification to Congress . <P> Does that mean that he can win , that opposition to the deal-expressed last June in a letter signed by 54 Senators ( including 20 Republicans ) and a House resolution co-sponsored by 252 Representatives-has faded ? Some members of Congress did assume that the White House must have made a head count and found enough backing , at least in the Republican-dominated Senate , to avoid rejection of the Saudi deal . To block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it by Oct. 30 . " He would n't have sent this up here unless he felt sure he was going to win , " said one Senate aide about the President . However , the Administration has so far not even decided on any specific plan to gain congressional support . Conceded one White House aide : " The legislative strategy group has not focused on the issue yet . " <P> Reagan clearly wants to push the Saudi package while his legislative record still looks invincible and while his popularity is high . His advisers also want to get the initial headlines on the controversial package behind them before Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin 's visit to the White House next week . Despite predictions by Senate Majority Leader Baker that the Senate , at least , will not vote to block the sale , a close fight looms . The outcome could depend on how strenuously Reagan personally joins the battle . Conceded Republican Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon , a leading opponent of the sale : " If this is a no-holds-barred fight , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unveiled last week , the price of the Saudi arms package totaled $8.5 billion . The five AWACS , whose advanced radar enables them to detect aircraft at a distance of 250 miles to 350 miles , and their support facilities account for $5.8 billion of that , and have attracted the most attention . Yet the proposal also includes 101 sets of fuel tanks to extend the range of the Saudis ' fleet of 62 F-15 Eagles . Probably the world 's best jet fighters , the F-15s will be sent to the Saudis in a sale that former President Jimmy Carter pushed through a skeptical Congress on the promise that they would not be given any longer-range capability than their present 2,878 miles . The new sale also includes 1,177 Sidewinder missiles for the F-15s , the same deadly weapon that U.S. F-14 fighters used to shoot down two Libyan aircraft two weeks ago. * To refuel both the fighters and the AWACS , the Administration also proposes to throw in eight KC-707 tankers . Delivery of the package would not start until 1985.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
