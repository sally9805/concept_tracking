Crack a Peter De Vries novel at random and you are likely to find a Midwesterner trying just a little too hard to keep from making a fool of himself among the sophisticates of the Northeast . The journey from Pocock , Ill. , to Decency , Conn. , has been played forward , backward and sideways , sometimes strictly for laughs and often , as in The Blood of the Lamb , to illustrate that comedy is not the opposite of tragedy but its Siamese twin . <P> The serious side of De Vries has been subject to considerable analysis , most of it attempts to align the author 's dour Dutch Calvinist upbringing with his development as a comic writer . To borrow a De Vriesian analogy , such treatment is like putting the reader into a diving bell and taking him down 3 ft . His latest novel counters that effect by granting his fans a chance to wet their feet once again in the forbidding shallows of sex , money and social class . <P> There is , of course , the usual danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your socks and sintillate " ; " Tending a cemetery is a grave responsibility . " " It Midas well be spring , " says a man fixing his car muffler . The book 's conspicuous title can have a number of meanings , all socially redeemed because the line is Shakespeare 's ( " The bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon , " Romeo and Juliet , Act II , Scene 4 ) . But there are no star-crossed lovers , only heavenly bodies tumbling from orbit to bounce in the bed of Eddie Teeters , a producer and sometime actor in pornographic videocassettes piously merchandised as sex-education films . <P> Teeters , recently transplanted to Merrymount , Conn. , is from Backbone , Ark. , where a scarcity of cultural opportunity has sharpened perceptions of social reality . " The trouble with treating people as equals , " he says , " is that the first thing you know they may be doing the same thing to you . Such reprisals seriously disrupt the pecking order , especially in a democracy where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other systems . " <P> In short , Teeters walks the tightrope between the egalitarian ideal and the reality of status . Merrymount society allows him to play the game , though it does not spell out the regulations . Rule 1 is that friendliness and even sexual intimacy do not automatically confer acceptance . Rule 2 is that the home team gets to suspend Rule 1 whenever it wants to flaunt its self- assurance . Cynthia Pickles , local ice princess and founder of Overview ( " a journal of opinion for all sides " ) , coolly sleeps with Teeters , accepts his nuptial propositions but marries smooth , rich Jerry Chirouble . Pickles ' underclass equivalent is Toby Snapper , a waitress whose services to Teeters include imitations of a pliant Cockney maid . <P> De Vries relies on literary parody , verbal burlesque and a baleful eye for " life-styles . " The result is a deftly improvised confusion in which the suburbs become the stage for fragments of Elizabethan comedy , bits of Wodehouse farce and a generalized send-up of The Great Gatsby . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend himself against charges of smut peddling . Unfortunately , he has arrived in Merrymount one beat behind the conservative backlash and can not convince a jury that his cassettes are the visual equivalent of The Joy of Sex .
