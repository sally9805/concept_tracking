More than half of the 180 residents of Saragosa , a tiny farm town in West Texas , were in the community hall Friday night attending a graduation ceremony for preschool children enrolled in a Government Head Start program . About 8 p.m. , some heard a whistling sound . " Someone yelled a tornado was coming , and parents started grabbing their kids from the stage , " recalls Elodia Garcia , 26 . A number shoved their children under tables and benches . <P> For many , it was already too late . The twister demolished not only the community hall but virtually every other building in Saragosa . At least 28 people were killed and more than 100 injured . In the predawn darkness Saturday , rescuers were still digging away at the wreckage of homes illuminated only by the lamps on the workers ' mining helmets . Bodies were laid out in a school bus converted into a makeshift morgue . Said Reeves County Jailer Janie Rodriguez : " The town is completely gone . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
