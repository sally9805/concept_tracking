Surveying the damage from the Drysdale default <P> To all appearances , it seemed pretty much business as usual in the Government securities trading rooms of Wall Street last week . But behind the scenes there was a mood of uncertainty in the once stodgy business of buying and selling U.S. Treasury bonds , bills and notes . For the brokers and dealers in the $700 billion market , the task at hand was to sort out the implications of the default two weeks ago by Drysdale Government Securities Inc. on more than $189 million worth of obligations to Chase Manhattan Bank and other major banks . Meanwhile in Washington , probes of the Drysdale affair were opened by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee . <P> For Chase Manhattan , the impact of the default was plain enough . After an impressive five-year string of earnings gains , the third largest commercial bank in the U.S. was confronting the biggest single loss in its history . Still unable to explain fully how the bank 's bond trading department had stumbled into its costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase had no choice but to swallow hard and announce a onetime write-off of perhaps $135 million after taxes , or more than what the bank had expected to earn in the second quarter . Another big commercial lender , Manufacturers Hanover Trust , was also hit , though its initial announcement of a likely $29 million write-off was later pared back to only about $9 million after taxes . <P> Bankers and brokers spent much of last week trying to nail down how Drysdale pulled off its caper . Though the nearly four-month-old company employed about 30 securities traders and operated with little more than $20 million in capital of its own , it had managed to put together a $6.5 billion portfolio of U.S. Government bonds , bills and notes . More than $4 billion of that was borrowed . Said a top Wall Street bond trader of the bewilderingly complex financial structure of the upstart firm 's activities : " It was the most astonishingly leveraged operation that I have ever seen . " <P> Basically , Drysdale 's traders , headed by President Richard Taaffe and Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury securities are valued in so-called repurchase deals . These are short-term transactions in which a bank or brokerage house raises cash by selling a Treasury security to another dealer on a promise to buy it back when the deal expires . Since typical repos last for only a few days , traders normally do not take account of the accrued interest on a bond , bill or note when valuing it in the transaction . Instead , when the interest is paid by the Treasury to the current holder , the money is automatically passed back to the original owner of the security .
