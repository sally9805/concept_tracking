This town , the busiest port for oceangoing vessels during colonial times other than Yorktown , Va. , is now but a freckle on the long arm of the Chesapeake Bay . This river , cutting through the little-known back half of the nation ' s capital , is all but forgotten by most Washingtonians. // // Four docks , built here in the late 1950s , are unused , rickety and rotting . Paper cups , hamburger wrappers , a diaper , and old tires hug the pilings - at least those that are not buried in silt. // ' ' If you ever wondered what happens to the salt and sand they put on the roads all winter , ' ' says Doug Green , who sells boats from a parking lot next to the abandoned marina , ' ' it ends up right here. ' ' // It all ends up here : sand and salt and motor oil and antifreeze and fertilizer and animal waste and countless other substances . The residue washed by rains and melting snow from city streets , lawns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anacostia through perhaps a dozen streams in the suburban counties north of Washington. // The Anacostia , long in the shadow of its majestic neighbor the Potomac - which it joins just south of the Jefferson Memorial in the middle of the District of Columbia - suffers the plight of many urban rivers . Massive development along its banks has ruined its recreational value , and inadequate public access has bred ignorance of its trouble , say government officials and environmentalists. // ' ' It would be a great source of recreation if it were only cleaned up , ' ' says Mr. Green , who grew up near here. // City , county , and state officials in the Anacostia watershed agree. // An accord signed by authorities in Maryland and the District in 1987 pledged regional cooperation in cleaning up the waterway . Under the agreement , the activities of state , county , and local officials are coordinated by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments ( MWCOG ) . Another interagency group , the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin ( ICPRB ) , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plight. // That has not always been easy , says Beverly Bandler of ICPRB . And encouraging local newspapers and television stations to cover a recent cleanup effort by the Maryland National Guard proved fruitless . ' ' You drop the name Potomac and they show up there . You say Anacostia and they don ' t , ' ' Ms. Bandler says . ( The Potomac River cleanup began in earnest only after record pollution in the summer of 1966 drew the attention of President Lyndon Johnson , some Anacostia-watchers say. ) // Whereas the Potomac flows past Washington ' s prestigious Georgetown section and alongside major tourist areas , at points the Anacostia passes by tenements with the windows boarded up . Officials acknowledge that the low visibility and socioeconomic stress of the Anacostia community have , in some measure , put the river cleanup on a slow track. // Robert Boone , a stream coordinator with ICPRB , says there ' s a great task in simply changing the attitudes of residents and developers toward the river . For a long time , Mr. Boone says , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' But slowly , he says , that is changing. // One sign of change : A developer has offered seed money to start a private organization to preserve the Anacostia . In January , Boone says , he will leave his government job to create Save the Anacostia River - the first conservation organization to be devoted exclusively to the Anacostia River Basin. // Cleaning up the 100-mile tidal portion of the Potomac took more than a decade and over $1 billion . Restoring the 12-mile Anacostia is expected to take longer and cost more . The reason : a diffuse source of pollution. // ' ' In the Potomac , pollution sources were easily identifiable point sources , ' ' says Wendy Chittenden , an environmental planner with MWCOG . ' ' All that was needed was to go into sewage-treatment plants and upgrade them. // ' ' In the Anacostia , there is no single identified source , ' ' she says . ' ' The pollution comes from general urbanization. ' ' // An explosion of development - gobbling up the countryside between Washington and Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such impermeable surfaces not only harbor the sediments that end up in the Anacostia , but also speed the flow of storm waters . And often , the fast-moving water will further erode unpaved lands and stream banks - compounding the sediment problem . In addition , experts say , toxic contaminants and dangerous nutrients tend to bond to silt particles - further concentrating pollution in the river . Such contamination may deplete the oxygen in the water , reduce or eliminate plant growth , and so destroy the habitat for aquatic life. // Furthermore , experts say , the pressure of tidal waters pushing up from the Chesapeake Bay into the Anacostia serves to trap much of the river ' s pollution at its mouth. // Increasingly , developers are required to mitigate the effects of development - by minimizing the impact of storm-water runoff at developed sites and by monitoring soil erosion on construction sites . But unfortunately , officials say , attention to such environmental details has not kept pace with development. // ' ' Maryland has some fairly good laws dealing with sediment control , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' The problem is , they don ' t have enough people to go out and monitor them all the time. ' ' // In response , Mr. Varner ' s group has organized and trained volunteers to walk the streams , spot pollution problems , and report them to local authorities for enforcement action. // Citizen involvement is modest , compared with the size of the problem facing the Anacostia . But changing the attitudes of residents and developers toward the Anacostia also helps a larger , even more complicated problem : preserving the nation ' s largest estuary. // ' ' Just about anything that hits the water in Maryland is going to end up in the Chesapeake Bay , ' ' Varner says. // //
