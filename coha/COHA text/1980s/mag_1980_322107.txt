The Democrats must build a new a party base-and vision <P> Democrats wandering from the wreckage of their 1980 presidential campaign will be bitter and disconsolate for a while . But as the smoke lifts and they count their losses in the Senate and in the House , it may occur to them that in terms of the party 's future , the defeat of Jimmy Carter , for all its landslide proportions , was not necessarily a disaster . Perversely , four years of Ronald Reagan may be what the Democrats need to recover the internal discipline and philosophical coherence-the party 's " soul , " as an old time New York politician puts it-that have been bleeding away since the late 1960s . <P> In a sense , Carter was an irrelevance to his own party . He was never a Democratic leader by either blood or inclination-not really . He never sought , like Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson , to preside as paterfamilias over the great brawling Democratic coalition , rewarding and remonstrating from the head of the table while all the family factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , intellectuals ) passed around the meat and potatoes . Carter won the White House in 1976 as a sweet-psalming loner circuit riding outside the party structures . As President , owing little or nothing to the party , he practiced a cool neglect of it . His motivations were rooted in his own interests , not the party 's : a perfect ' 70s politician . He did not encourage new Democratic talent or ideas ; he neglected both the mechanism and the vision of the party , its sheer reason for being . Thus Carter 's defeat is less traumatic to the Democrats than it might have been ; it is like the end of a loveless marriage . <P> In defeat , Carter will probably cease almost at once to be a political force . One night last month , he swore : " This is my last campaign , the last political race I will ever run . " A book based on the meticulous diary he kept during his White House years probably will occupy him , along with plans for a presidential library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to pay off old political debts-to Fritz Mondale , for example-but as one Eastern Democratic leader says , " As far as the party is concerned , Carter will disappear like dew on a hot day . " <P> With Carter in power another four years , the Democrats might have been able to slide along in the self-delusion that their party remained , after all , the voice of the American majority , still something like the fractiously diverse pluralistic parade that Roosevelt organized . Now Democrats will have to face the truth : their party has been rusting and clunking along for years on only two or three cylinders . Unless they recover their partisan energies and intellectual vigor , the Democrats could enter a long historical passage of declining influence and relevance , becoming the political equivalent of some of the decaying cities of the Northeast , once flourishingly productive , the exuberant places where the modern Democratic Party originated .
