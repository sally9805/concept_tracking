" Life is such a sweet insanity , " warbles the banal theme song for NBC 's new comedy series Valerie . TV sitcoms have spent more than three decades trying to prove that adage , but never more aggressively than now . Eight sitcoms are debuting this month for midseason tryouts . One reason for the onslaught : NBC 's The Cosby Show sets a new ratings record virtually every week , and several other comedies , including Family Ties , Cheers , Who 's the Boss and Golden Girls , frequently finish in the Nielsen Top Ten . <P> Ratings , however , are not the only explanation for the sitcom 's resurgence . Half-hour comedies are becoming more attractive to the networks because of a dispute with Hollywood producers over the rising costs of hour-long action- adventure shows . Network payments do not fully cover the cost of making these series ; production companies recoup their money by selling the reruns later in syndication . But hour series are not doing well on the rerun market , and some major studios are threatening to bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cost . <P> Sitcoms , on the other hand , are cheaper to produce and almost always do well in reruns . The trouble with most of the newcomers is that they look like reruns already . You Again ( Jack Klugman as a divorced father ) and Tough Cookies ( Robby Benson as a Chicago police detective ) are about as dumb and hackneyed as the genre gets . CBS 's Fast Times , though based on a smart , funny movie about high school life , Fast Times at Ridgemont High , is nearly as lame . The problems start with the casting . As Spicoli , the spaced-out surfer played hilariously in the film by Sean Penn , Dean Cameron projects nothing more than a 5-o'clock shadow ; a baby-faced Sean Penn lookalike , Patrick Dempsey , plays Damone , the school 's cool con artist . Bummer . <P> Valerie Harper , once TV 's best-known neurotic single , is back in sitcomland as a housewife and mother of three boys in Valerie . Unfortunately , she spends more time milking gag lines than paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spills maple syrup all over the breakfast table , Mom yells convincingly but makes no move toward the table . Is there a mother on earth who would not be there with a sponge in two seconds flat ? Of course , the gooey mess must stay in place so 16-year-old David ( Jason Bateman ) can sit in it , so Mom will have to clean his pants later on , so she will find a note in the pocket written by his new 24-year-old girlfriend , so they can have a fight over his dating an " older woman " and provide a reason for the episode . But no good reason for watching Valerie . <P> The spring , however , is not without hope . The most promising seedling on the midseason schedule is NBC 's All Is Forgiven , created by Glen and Les Charles and James Burrows , the team responsible for Cheers . Last week 's initial segment , though jam-packed with jokes and characters , sweated less than most sitcom pilots . Bess Armstrong stars as Paula , a career woman who gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV soap opera on the same day . The series will apparently shuttle between conflicts at home ( her husband Matt has a punkish daughter who resents her ) and at work , where the gallery of nuts ranges from a brash receptionist to an effusive , Southern-fried head writer , played attractively by Carol Kane.
