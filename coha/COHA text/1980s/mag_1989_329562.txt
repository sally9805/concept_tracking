Bill Woodley killed his first elephant at 16 . By 19 he had shot 150 tuskers and lived as a professional ivory hunter . Today , at 60 , he is the elephant 's staunchest protector , leading the desperate war against poachers in Kenya 's Tsavo National Park . " They say once an elephant hunter , always an elephant hunter , " says Woodley . " But I 've spent the past 41 years hunting poachers . " The difference , he observes wryly , is that " poachers shoot back . " <P> Tsavo , the country 's largest wildlife reserve , was once the grandest elephant sanctuary in Kenya . Now it is a case study of what has gone wrong  --  and how the elephant may yet be saved . Tsavo stretches over 8,000 sq . mi. , an area the size of Israel . In the mid-1960s , 40,000 elephants thundered amid the scrub thorn , acacia and baobob trees . Last year 's aerial survey spotted only 5,363 live elephants in and around the park , and 2,421 carcasses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to flee at the scent of man . <P> Years ago , Wakamba tribesmen poached in Tsavo , using arrows tipped with poison . Now Somali gangs , including many former soldiers , spray whole families of elephants with automatic-weapon fire . Not all Tsavo 's poachers have been outsiders to the park . Some who are paid to protect the elephants  --  wardens and rangers  --  are also suspect . The evidence : Woodley and others have extracted .303-cal. bullets from carcasses . " The only people who use .303s are the rangers , " he says . Numerous carcasses have been found near the rangers ' headquarters . And when the park 's patrol plane is grounded for inspection , the poachers quickly appear . Someone has tipped them off . Corruption is hard to eradicate , since rangers ' salaries run as low as $90 a month . " It was policy not to interfere with departmental poaching , " says an assistant warden . <P> Now Kenya is striking back . In his breast pocket , Woodley has an envelope stuffed with 30,000 Kenyan shillings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exchanging their World War I bolt-action rifles for automatic assault weapons . Within the past year the APUs have killed 18 poachers under a shoot-to-kill order . Dozens of senior wildlife-department personnel have been interrogated , and some have been relieved of their duties . These measures seem to be working . In the past month not one fresh carcass has been found . " Everyone is keen as mustard , " says Woodley , beaming . " We 'll win for sure . " It is too early , though , to declare victory . After a similar crackdown in 1978 , the price of ivory soared and poaching resumed . <P> In July , Kenya 's President , Daniel arap Moi , set ablaze a twelve-ton mountain of illicit ivory  --  3,000 tusks worth $3 million . To those familiar with the plundering of Kenya 's herds and the corruption in its wildlife department , the fire was a kind of exorcism . " If we go wrong here , hope will be lost in many parts of this continent , " says Richard Leakey , who became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go right here , there is a chance for things to happen elsewhere much more rapidly than any of us would have dared to believe .
