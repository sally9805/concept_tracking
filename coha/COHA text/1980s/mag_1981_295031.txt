In James Baldwin 's first novel , Go Tell It on the Mountain ( 1952 ) , there is a brief early scene in which Baldwin 's 14-year-old black hero , John Grimes , takes a headlong run down a hill of melting snow : " At the bottom of the hill , where the ground abruptly leveled off onto a gravel path , he nearly knocked down an old white man with a white beard , who was walking very slowly and leaning on his cane . They both stopped , astonished , and looked at one another . John struggled to catch his breath and apologize , but the old man smiled . John smiled back . It was as though he and the old man had between them a great secret . " <P> At least part of their great secret is that they both live in the same country . White and black have shared that secret for a long time now , and have done an efficient job of keeping it from each other .

If Baldwin had been writing news instead of fiction , John might never have thought to apologize , and the old man might have swung his cane like a war club . <P> Now that would make a scene one could more easily believe in .

In the March issue of FORTUNE , Roger Wilkins sees blacks and whites separated by a widening " social chasm .

Terms like white flight and steering have become so comfortable in the national argot that one almost forgets that they are weapons . Affirmative action has helped split black and white as well , particularly black and blue collar and black and Jew , on the issue of quotas . Then too there are the white lies told daily in the universities by fainthearted , if well-meaning , professors writing false recommendations for unprepared black students for jobs in which they are bound to fail ; the professors then are lost in dismay when the students fail and resent the lie . All these things and more , including white racism , whose unredeemed resilience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scrawled above the nation 's urinals , where it belongs . <P>
