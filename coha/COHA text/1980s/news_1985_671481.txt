A huge hulk of linear forms and cubic volumes , it ' s a cleaned-up , schematic view of " Dragged Mass , " a messy outdoor piece that he did 14 years ago for the Detroit Institute of Arts , in which tractors dragged a 30-ton granite block back and forth over the ground . The movement displaced 300 tons of earth , fulfilling its mission to produce an " impressive " pile of dirt , some 8 feet high and 40 feet long . The earlier piece - no longer extant - was one of the more citified of the mammoth earth works that the multitalented Heizer has been doing since 1967 , mainly in the desert lands of California and Nevada. // " Dragged Mass Geometric " is an attempt to " engineer " - recast in the form of a three-dimensional drawing , so to speak - not only the substance but also the process of the earlier work . A temporary structure made entirely of cardboard sheets over an armature of metal trusses , and measuring 115 feet long by 16 1/2 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of the granite block itself in the act of forming its big dirt pile . Long , linear windrows represent the earth thrown up at the sides of the block by its motion . Even the hole is made evident , by cantilevering the main mass of the structure to leave under it a visible space . The cardboard surface , used by Heizer as a material similar in its " humbleness " to dirt , is silk-screened with photographic material taken from various geologic sources - rock grain , mud , minerals. // The wild and audacious result of Heizer ' s labors is not much to look at in terms of conventional sculpture . But its huge , looming bulk , with its rambling geometric forms and angles , its tight containment in the gallery ' s space ( so that the viewer can never " read " it as a whole ) , and its impressive engineering give it considerable impact as an architectural environment . At the same time , poking around and in it ( a ramp in the structure allows for a partial overview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of ruins left by androids. // For those of us who can ' t get to the far-flung sites of Heizer ' s outdoor works , the Whitney has plastered the walls of adjoining galleries with photographs , blown up to mural size , of a representative selection . Among the more formidable desert endeavors are " Double Negative , " a pair of corridors 50 feet deep and 1 , 500 feet long cut in a mesa , " Complex One , " an earth mastaba 140 feet long " banded " from a distance by vertical and horizontal columns of concrete that are actually separate elements when seen close up , and a series of large-scale line " drawings " in dry lake beds collectively titled " Nine Nevada Depressions. " // More recently , shown here as a photograph of the model , there is " Effigy Tumuli , " five earth mounds compressed into animal shapes , each up to 1 , 000 feet long and 25 feet high and deployed over a mile of land , that Heizer is doing as a coal mine reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , can ' t begin to convey the dramatic impact that the works make when seen " live , " they do give a sense of their spectacular scale and siting. // The truth is that Heizer is a master of landscape-size imagery . He ' s at his best when moving earth and rock into vast configurations whose interest comes from the tension they create between human artifact and that made by nature . But seen against his larger conceptions , his smaller works are not nearly so convincing. // His show at the Whitney , through Sept. 1 , overshadows the concurrent one around the corner at Xavier Fourcade , 36 East 75th Street ( through Sept. 14 ) , in which more portable , take-home objects are presented . There are several wonderful things here , to be sure . One , using 50 photographic prints arranged in a large circle , recapitulates the 500-foot circle Heizer imprinted on a dry Nevada lake bed in 1970 by means of motorcycle tires . Another is a pair of etchings , made from scrap-metal pieces embellished with additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Platform " commissioned by the Oakland Museum in 1980. // But most of the small-scale sculpture here looks bland in light of his larger works . Several drawings , based on silk-screen reproductions of photographs of large works , are too prettily punched up with high chromatics and tricked out with notations , scribblings , brush strokes , etc . Less gimmicky , but not too engrossing either , are " texture " paintings made by tracking rollers impregnated with black pigment over canvas . By and large , the Fourcade show tends to prove that Heizer ' s own instincts , which are to stay away from work of comfortably salable size , are quite correct . Scale is his metier . Also of interest this week : Tony Bechara ( Museo del Barrio , 1230 Fifth Avenue , at 104th Street ) : Ancient mosaics , Islamic tiles , pointillism and what he calls the " controlled chaos " of New York City ' s streets are among the sources for Tony Bechara ' s gridded paintings . Seen up close , they ' re composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quarter-inch tape , then applying pigment . Backed away from , their busy surfaces become shimmering , eloquent compositional arrangements developed by chromatic concentration of the squares to form abstract configurations . In " Night Music , " for example , a particularly beautiful work , surges of bluish reds and blacks emerge from the particolored ground to produce a kind of floral - well , vibration ; one hesitates to call it a pattern . Arhythmic intensities of black , red and blue give " Thunder " its stormy feeling . And sometimes the squares form a dense overall surface lyrically patterned by the play of light alone , as in the free-standing three-part panels of " Three Graces. " // Ranging over five years , this selection of Bechara ' s work gives the museum , devoted to the art of Caribbean peoples , its first exhibition of abstract art . It ' s a scintillating choice . ( Through Aug. 31 . ) " Social Studies " ( Barbara Gladstone Gallery , 152 Wooster Street ) : Work by six " socially involved " artists gives this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coherence . The mix is too loose , and with each artist represented by only one item , the overall impact is diffuse . Sue Coe weighs in with one of her lurid tabloids , " Vigilante , " a white hoodlum shooting down two black youths on a subway platform . Eric Fischl suburban-baits as usual in " Birth of Love , " a fleshy , sullenly lighted poolside scene in which a youth lays explorative hands on a leering woman . Bill Woodrow ' s " Call of the Wild , " made entirely from car hoods , is a savage sculptural fantasy in which a bearlike creature , beaten into a flat rug , barks into three microphones . And then there are contributions by Jenny Holzer and Leon Golub. // But the real coup is an endeavor by Tim Rollins , who works in a South Bronx public school , and K.O.S. , a group of some 40 teen-agers who collaborate with him . Their " Amerika , " made after a discussion of the Franz Kafka novel , is a jubilant mural of quirky musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , networked on a ground of pasted-up pages from the novel . It ' s explained as an allegory of " social democracy , " which doesn ' t quite account for its wonderful pizzazz . ( Through July 26 . ) " Private Gone Public " ( Soho 20 , 469 Broome Street ) : Another show of work by six " gut issue " artists - this time all women - assembled by the art critic Ellen Lubell . Two , Bonnie Lucas and Erika Rothenberg , are wits , and sly ones at that . Lucas makes clever assemblages of baby clothes and female fripperies - laces , ribbons , glitter , fake jewelery , etc. - in not-so-demure compositions that put down accepted female roles . Rothenberg ' s cartoony panels present such concepts as the " Right to Life Boutique " for men , purveying anti-abortion trinkets. // Sue Coe - again - and Howardena Pindell express their political concerns via specific events . Coe ' s painting depicts the death of Bobby Sands , the Irish hunger striker , attended by a leering cast of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of her richly textured wall pieces , into which she inserts photo transfers of maimed hands and wrecked buildings . May Stevens ' s contribution is a moving study of her mother ' s " ordinary " life , here seen in passage from youth to dazed old age . The least of these works are Nancy Spero ' s small , sketchy prints in which friezelike figures and heads of women are attitudinized in " revolutionary " poses . But overall , it ' s an eloquent little show . ( Through July 10. ) //
