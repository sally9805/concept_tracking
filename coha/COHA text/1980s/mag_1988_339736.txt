Ellesmere , a Canadian island just 500 miles south of the North Pole , is a beautiful but forbidding world where the summer sun is candlelight soft and few living things can survive . It is also one of the last places on earth where the wolf roams unthreatened by man . In 1986 two men , biologist L. David Mech and photographer Jim Brandenburg , set out for Ellesmere to do what no one had ever done : live with a wild-wolf pack . Achieving all they had hoped for and more , Mech and Brandenburg managed to set up camp next to a wolf den and , most astonishingly , accompany the pack during hunts . Sponsored by the National Geographic Society , Mech and Brandenburg went back the next year with a film crew to give the world its first close-up view of life among the Arctic wolves . <P> The story of those remarkable summers is told in a pair of picture-filled books to be published this month : Mech 's The Arctic Wolf : Living with the Pack ( Voyageur Press ; $24.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Legend ( NorthWord Press ; $40 ) . Later this fall Brandenburg 's film documentary of the second expedition will air as a National Geographic TV special . These portraits of the Arctic wolf will surprise many readers and viewers . For all its vaunted prowess as a fierce predator , the wolf leads a tough life and relies on complex social behavior to survive . <P> Despite the unforgiving conditions of the High Arctic , Mech and Brandenburg discovered that the Ellesmere wolves are secure , unlike their brethren elsewhere . Except for parts of Canada , Alaska and Minnesota , Canis lupus has all but vanished from North America . Wolves have been killed as a result of their exaggerated reputation as plunderers of livestock or just because people hate and fear them . <P> In recent years , however , a growing body of literature , notably Barry Lopez 's Of Wolves and Men and R.D. Lawrence 's In Praise of Wolves , has tried to rehabilitate the wolf 's reputation . But specialists have been forced to study shy wild animals from a distance . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs to prove it until Mech and Brandenburg traveled to Ellesmere . <P> Soon after establishing a base on the Kansas-size island , the men approached a pack . Mech immediately dropped flat on his belly and began whining loudly , both to get the wolves ' attention and to convince them that he was no threat . For the next few days Mech and Brandenburg spent much of their time groveling , trying to win the wolves ' acceptance . Eventually , the pack allowed the men to set up tents within 200 ft. of its den . <P> As Mech and Brandenburg got to know the pack , they gave each wolf a name . Among them were Scruffy , a playful yearling who was picked on by his elders , and Mom , an easygoing female . At one point , Mom calmly watched as her puffball pups scrambled over Mech 's feet , untying his shoelaces . Later , Brandenburg entered the den and photographed the babies while Mom waited outside . <P> Wolf experts have long known that a pack has a social structure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack is led by a dominant , " alpha , " male and female , and every other wolf knows its place in the chain of command . Much of wolf home life is focused on teaching the pups to be competitive , while at the same time schooling them in the social graces of the hierarchy .
