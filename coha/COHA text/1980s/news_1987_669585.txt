Cambodia ' s identity as a nation is wrapped up in the age-old drama of its classical dancers - some 90 percent of whom died or were killed in the late 1970s under the communist Khmer Rouge regime , which tried to wipe out the country ' s traditional culture. // The Cambodian dancer - who can curve her fingers back like a swan ' s neck , who can reveal story plots just by shifting her dark , almond-shaped eyes , who can hold her bare foot aloft in a graceful minuet - was as rare as a capitalist during the country ' s Maoist-like ' ' cultural revolution. ' ' // The attempted extermination of a people ' s artistic way of life might have succeeded if it were not for the Cambodians ' memory of the joy and beauty of the fairylike dancing that goes back more than a thousand years to the days of India ' s Hindu influence in Southeast Asia. // // Charming images of the female dancers are found on the stone bas-relief of the ruins of Angkor Wat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and orchestra - high-pitched nasal tones of female singers accompanied by xylophones , flutes , one-string violins , and gongs in a ragtime-style tangle of sounds - have changed little. // The highly trained , controlled Khmer dance style , even though not forgotten , was really revived after the 1979 ouster of the Khmer Rouge to serve useful political purposes for the two groups that today claim to represent Cambodia ( also known as Kampuchea ) . // If it takes two to tango , it has taken the two warring sides to bring back the country ' s classical art form. // On the one side is the Hanoi-backed communist People ' s Republic of Kampuchea ( PRK ) , which rules over most of the country and is based in the capital , Phnom Penh. // Reviving Khmer dance helps rebut the party ' s critics , who claim Vietnam , which still keeps an estimated 140 , 000 troops in Cambodia , plans to ' ' Vietnamize ' ' its neighbor. // The other side is the Western-backed Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea , a tripartite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ' s seat at the UN. // The coalition is led by exiled Prince Norodom Sihanouk , who exalted the classical court dancing during his 1941-70 rule and who claims to be the rightful protector of the Cambodian way of life . ( The former king , who abdicated the throne in 1955 to become a politician , is on a year ' s leave from the coalition . ) Ironically , the two separate dance revivals are led by two ex-dancers from the former Royal Ballet of the 1960s , who used to perform together. // One is the prince ' s daughter , Princess Norodom Bopha Devi , who returned recently from her home-in-exile in Paris to teach Khmer dance to Cambodians who have fled their country and who live in a pro-Sihanouk refugee camp known as Site B along the Thai border . She is hoping to create a professional troupe , according to a spokesman. // The other is Cheng Phon , the PRK ' s minister of culture , who has helped revive the Fine Arts School in Phnom Penh , which opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The state , the ( Communist ) Party , and the people regard dance as the soul of the Kampuchean people , ' ' he said in an interview . About 200 students are studying classical dancing full time at the school , led by about 30 surviving dance instructors . In all , the school is home to more than 500 young people studying Khmer music , opera , sculpture , goldsmithing , and other arts. // ' ' Many of my former students are in Paris . When I visited them , they say they wanted to come back but are afraid , ' ' said Mr. Phon . The coalition ' s guerrillas , which include the Khmer Rouge , claim responsibility for numerous attacks around the country , mainly against Vietnamese. // Unlike dancing during Sihanouk ' s time , today ' s dancing has a less elitist purpose than just performing for the royal court , Mr. Phon said. // Prime Minister Hun Sen told an arts festival in January that Kampuchean artists and authors should do their best to combat the ' ' debauching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more style than dancing under Sihanouk , ' ' said the culture minister . ' ' His was only for preservation of the dance and only for the king . But if people have a healthy and clear mind from watching a performance , then they can help improve the economy. ' ' // Performances given in the villages and towns are often given a ' ' nationalist ' ' aspect , the culture minister said . For instance , at one recent show in the capital , staged for the visiting Cuban foreign minister , the final number was a Cambodian folk dance showing the triumph of Vietnam over the Khmer Rouge. // ' ' The style and the music are the same , ' ' he said , ' ' but the story can show the people a new spirit that is favorable to the regime. ' ' // The cultural recovery from the Khmer Rouge devastation has been swift . By 1980 , the country had its first arts festival ; in 1981 , its first songfest . In 1982 , there was a revival of Ajai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddles and giving answers to the beat of an Ajai drum . Last year , the government sent a troupe to India for a dance contest to see who could best perform the Hindu epic , ' ' The Ramayana. ' ' // By 1984 , the fine arts school was able to present more than 300 dancers , singers , and musicians in a pagaent celebrating the ' ' work solidarity ' ' among Cambodia , Laos , and Vietnam and ' ' other fond subjects , ' ' according to an official account . The country now has more than 5 , 000 ' ' theater workers , ' ' said Phon . That ' s about one-third the number of Communist Party members. // Phon said that Cambodian dancers study Vietnamese dance movements , but that the two styles are difficult to blend . He dismisses the idea that Cambodia will lose its cultural identity to Vietnam. // ' ' The Vietnamese do not understand our culture , ' ' he said . ' ' I have talked to Princess Bopha , who said she was worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the minister of culture , she said she had confidence that the Khmer ways were safe. ' ' // Other arts , especially opera and movies , are being strongly encouraged . The government imports 100 to 120 films a year , mainly East European or Indian , which are shown in the nation ' s 29 movie houses . Earlier this year , a Czechoslovak movie crew came here to film ' ' Nine Steps to Hell , ' ' a love story set against the Khmer Rouge horrors . Filming was disrupted , however , when the actors , dressed as Khmer Rouge soldiers , were attacked by peasants who thought they were the real thing , according to one observer. // //
