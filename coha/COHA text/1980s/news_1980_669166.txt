Panmunjom is just 60 miles north of Cho Dong Village . Kwangju , four months ago the scene of South Korea ' s worst conflict since the North invaded 30 years ago , lies 130 miles south. // The threat of menace and tragedy is real . Some mornings children working in the fields bring in propaganda pamphlets , sent down from the DMZ by balloons at night . These days the leaflets hail the " just struggle for democracy " and warn of " flagrant preparations for a new war by US imperialism and the South Korean puppet clique. " // Said one in English : " Americans , you will die. " // Yet the village is about as peaceful a place as you can imagine . Its rice fields are nestled among pine-forested mountains , which cover 70 percent of the Korean peninsula . The rugged terrain , from the Mountain of Abundant Virtue in the south to the stark , barren ridges of the north , seems to enclose and protect the valley , even though North Korean bombers are only 2 1/2 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swallows , life is a mixture of modern technique and traditional custom . In the past 10 years , methods of cultivation have changed drastically with new high-yield dwarf Tongil rice , chemical fertilizers , irrigation pumps , and power tillers . Cold-resistant vinyl greenhouses are now used to grow rice seedlings , lettuce , garlic , radishes , peppers , and Chinese cabbage in early spring. // The village owes much of its prosperity to the spread of universal literacy and the extension of land ownership to South Korea ' s former sangmin tenant class in the 1950s . The social leveling left Cho Dong Kok with a lively participatory democracy , a rarity in rural Asia , where the propertied , literate " haves " usually lord it over the landless , illiterate " have-nots. " // Yet development lagged in the 1960s as most government investment was channeled into industry . Droves of young people drifted to the cities , especially to Seoul . Happily , this trend was reversed in the 1970s . The Park regime invested $4 billion in rural development , moved factories to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) movement . The latter emphasized irrigation , reforestation , the formation of credit unions , expansion of health services as well as bridge and well building. // Today the small farmer is the dominant figure in South Korean agriculture . A villager can easily adopt new techniques , seeds , and machinery , given the countrywide structure of credit , extension , and modern transport to growing urban markets . A 95 percent literacy rate now prevails in rural areas , and the farm science establishment is dominated by US-educated people with advanced degrees. // In 1977 South Korea broke the world ' s record for the average rice yield per acre . Yet average holdings are only 2. 2 acres . Remarkably , this 10-year agricultural transformation has left Cho Dong Kok ' s traditional Confucian culture , inculcated over centuries of stable rule under Korea ' s Yi dynasty ( 1392-1910 ) , almost wholly intact . The tenets of Confucianism still provide the inner compass to the rural Korean ' s mind. // To the villagers , Confucianism is a philosophic justification of government by a benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony , and communal obligations flow from the adage " Filial piety is the basis of all conduct . " Sons are subordinate to fathers , younger brothers to elder brothers , wives to husbands , and subjects to state. // These villagers worry that the political uneasiness in South Korean cities suggests a cultural breakdown among the younger urban generation. // Kim Chang Kyu and his wife , a farming couple with whom this writer stayed , were educated in classical Confucian studies , as were most members of the village ' s older generation . Indeed , Cho Dong Kok means " place of the Confucian school , " though the school closed its doors a few years ago . Kim studied law in Japan , but war kept him from practicing . When he returned home , it was to farm. // As a member of Korea ' s yangban , or old landlord-official class , Kim lost all but three acres in the land reform . Now he is prepared to make great sacrifices to educate his five children . At 32 , " elder brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed his marriage until the youngest child , 19-year-old Byung , enters a university. // Kim ' s pride and joy is his youngest daughter , Sun Mi . She is a 22-year-old student at a university in Seoul and is determined to study law . Sun Mi also is caught between two cultures . In her blue jeans and T-shirts , she voices deep respect for her father , but , without his knowledge , is conspiring to find a wife for " elder brother . " Traditionally , the father picks the bride. // At home ordinary life seems to belong to another time altogether . To Cho Dong Kok ' s people , nesting swallows are a happy omen , as they are to Shakespeare ' s Macbeth . When I left the village , the tiny birds were just migrating back , darting in and out of almost every farmhouse to remake last year ' s nests under roof beams. // Often , as the family gathered for a meal , two swallows would fly in and out , almost brushing our heads . They perched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s eaves , well within hand reach. // Kim ' s house smelled wholesomely of wood smoke , grain , and garlic-marinated kimchi pickles . When Paduga , the dog , was not barking at some passing peddler  --  anyone from an old man selling seaweed to a youth roaring up on a motorcycle with his stock of latest cassettes  --  one could hear the ticking of a grandfather clock . Men plowing in the fields could be heard calling , " Do-do-do ! " to keep a cow or ox from lurching off course . Often a newly born calf trotted alongside , tripping over the furrows. // Until five years ago , most village houses were thatched . Now , exhorted by the " self-help , cooperation , and discipline " Confucian-style slogan of the Saemaul movement , most have tile or metal roofs brightly painted in deep blue , green , orange , or red . The houses themselves stay traditional : L-shaped rooms around a teak-roofed porch , with stucco wattle-and-daub walls , sliding paper windows in woodern frames , and floors heated from below by stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken from cupboards and spread across the warm floors . Aside from cushions , cupboards , big rice chests , and a TV , there is little furniture. // There are also shrines for late ancestors . Yangban families have been known to impoverish themselves or go into debt to spend on feasts honoring forebears . Explained Kim : " If a yangban family doesn ' t prepare rich food , the neighbors will say , ' Why do you prepare such a humble table for your ancestors ? " In Cho Dong Kok , as elsewhere , " what will people say " are potent words. // The village ' s sangmin , since getting land in the 1949-to-1953 reform , tend to have grander houses . They own all six of Cho Dong Kok ' s power tillers but none have children in college , as four of the yangban families do. // Kim ' s household has an air of genteel poverty . The most valued possessions are three 17th-century scrolls inscribed with Chinese calligraphy ; they were given to Kim ' s ancestors , as members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasty court. // In May the entire family came home to help with the spring rice transplanting , a new custom in the labor-short Korean villages since most people between 17 and 35 now work in towns . Cho Dong Kok ' s fields were filled with people knee deep in cold water and backs bent to quickly thrust clumps of seedlings into the soft mud. // Despite the hard work , there was a feeling of frivolity and family reunion . Breaks for meals along the road became picnics . Kim ' s wife brought pork and chicken stews , steaming rice , spicy vegetables , fish , leathery dried squid , and kimchi. // All day boys trotted from seedbed to field with towels tied around their heads and heavy loads of green seedlings stacked on A-frames on their backs . In late afternoon Byung , in his black schoolboy ' s uniform , rolled up his trousers and joined the rest of the family , working until late dusk . In a few days the watery surface of the fields was spangled with tiny green shoots and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of reviving . South Korea ' s temperate climate means freezing snowy winters and a steamy summer monsoon , but in spring and fall the air is bracing . Apricot , cherry , and peach orchards were in bloom in Cho Dong Kok . The surrounding hills were ablaze with yellow forsythia and pink azalea , with tiny violets along the paths . The pine forests have regrown since the devastation of the Korean war , and tall Lombardy poplars line most of the country roads. // Kim ' s family , though Confucian , is also Buddhist . Buddhism is enjoying a evival among young Koreans , and up at Bright Cloud Temple a group of mostly village girls with high school educations spend their days in study and prayer . The abbess , her head shaven and wearing the immaculate gray robes of the order , is an educated woman . After lunch , she took us to see some newly painted murals adorning the outer walls of the main temple , set in a cherry orchard. // Most depicted familiar tales of Buddha ' s life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk who dreamed his soul had become a half-white , half-brown ox . " Our souls are both good and evil , " the abbess said . The dream ends with the monk happily playing a flute and riding off on his now pure-white ox . In another mural showing a misty landscape of jagged peaks , pines , and waterfalls , the monk was shown approaching a mountain monastery that looked like Bright Cloud Temple . To its villagers the Valley of the Swallows seems almost as much a haven and refuge as the temple does to the nuns . The rural dwellers cling to the Confucian concept that order and security come from a harmonious relationship between master and subject , ruler and ruled. // South Korea is a nation of valleys . What is troubling about its current political restiveness is that the Confucian culture preserved in its villages may have lost its grip in the new industrial order of the cities . Japan has evolved a successful post-Confucianist society , but industrialization came there more gradually. // Much of Asia ' s political tumult can be traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the collapse of traditional authority and customs . No culture is ever static , but usually there is time to adjust to change. // Twenty-five years ago 8 out of 10 South Koreans lived in villages like Cho Dong Kok . Today less than three do . When change comes this fast  --  no society has ever industrialized and urbanized quicker  --  a system can grow incoherent . Those caught up in it can find the old inherited solutions to problems no longer work . Political turbulence can then , without conscious intent , bring a whole society to a state of collapse. // Chances are this will not happen . But it is what an older generation back in the villages is most worried about. // //
