WE call them the Pennsylvania Dutch , and we tend to think of their culture in cliches : pretzel-making , shoofly pie , woodenware adorned with flat red hearts and flowers , the decorative calligraphy known as fraktur . Some of us even feel that we know more about it than we really want to . Yet a new and respectful exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art , properly identifying these sturdy Teutonic farm people as Pennsylvania Germans , reveals much of interest to be learned from a deeper look. // According to its organizers - Beatrice B. Garvan , associate curator of American art at the Philadelphia Museum , and Charles F. Hummel , deputy director for collections at Winterthur Museum outside Wilmington , Del. - " The Pennsylvania Germans : A Celebration of Their Arts , 1683-1850 " is the " most comprehensive " display of Pennsylvania German culture ever mounted . The exhibition , which runs through next Jan. 9 , brings together for the first time the culture ' s full visual range , they say , " from plow to fraktur poem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is surprising variety : paintings , furniture , household utensils , fabrics , needlework , tools , guns , silverware , books , documents and plates . These last are decorated with characteristic informality , including one that reads : " I cook what I can . If my pig will not eat it , my husband will. " // The show celebrates , slightly prematurely , the 300th anniversary of the first major German migration to America in 1683 and the founding that year of Germantown , now part of Philadelphia , by Francis Daniel Pastorius , a lawyer from Frankfurt . The " Germans " who came then and afterward , drawn by the promise of religious freedom and a chance to make a living , were not only from Germany , but from Austria , Holland , Switzerland , Moravia and Silesia . But regardless of their origins , they were lumped together as " Dutch " until the 19th century . The English settlers looked on them with resentment - as late as 1755 , Benjamin Franklin referred to them in writing as " Palatine boors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania colony. // Yet the Pennsylvania Germans were , so to speak , very good for the neighborhood . They brought both manual and intellectual talents to the colony ; they worked hard , cherished individuality and had a healthy respect for freedom ( they were among the first opponents of slavery ) . Their family feelings ran deep , and if they were devoutly religious , they also had a sense of fun. // Their lives were centered in the home , and there was no part of it that they didn ' t embellish with country gusto . They painted rooms brightly , covered floors with cheerful rugs and piled beds high with feather comforting . The folksy decorative motifs that we see today in @kitschy , watered-down versions are strong and appealing in early work : fat , solid hearts , flowers at peak bloom , well-fed horses , joyously singing birds. // This peasant exuberance is plainly evident in the show , whose aim , according to its two curators , is to dispel our " stereotyped " view of the Pennsylvania Germans , give a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they made to American arts and crafts in general . " They may have been the greatest producers ever of middle-class household objects , " Mr. Hummel said. // The show is divided into seven " interpretive " sections , in which objects on display are tied to a theme . Throughout these sections , the beautifully crafted furniture made by the Pennsylvania Germans is solidly present : great armoires embellished with love knots and the names of the couple who owned them ; carved and painted wedding chests ; a plank-seat chair , its back pierced by a cookie-cutter heart ; plain tables and chests made in the Moravian community . There are even examples of Chippendale and other non-Teutonic styles turned out by German craftsmen to order for the English colonists. // One of the most interesting of the interpretive sections is " The Home , " a series of room settings showing the equipage of daily life , including a kitchen cupboard of walnut and tulipwood ( 1750-75 ) ; a " betty lamp " of iron , suspended from a hook and chain , made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobe known as a Kleiderschrank , with inlaid designs , used for storing clothes and household textiles ( 1768 ) ; a bedstead of tulipwood and white pine spread with an embroidered lace-edged sheet and a woven coverlet of cotton , wool and linen. // Other household items are in the section called " From Diversity , " reflecting the settlers ' widely varied places of origin : a massive wardrobe of black walnut , made in Berks County in 1781 but evoking the late baroque style in Germany ; a wool-and-cotton Jacquard coverlet by Martin Hoke , a skilled weaver of Baden , Germany , whose prancing deer and stylized floral design reflects 18th-century German weaving traditions. // The marketplace and its prominence in Pennsylvania German affairs is the theme of another section . In it , goods made for sale and barter by the colonists - hardware , cloth , leather , glass , furniture , pottery , guns and craft objects - are shown in shoplike settings . On view here are diverse products from Lancaster County , including a sugar bowl ( 1765-74 ) of pattern-molded glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hardwood butter print , made between 1800 and 1815 , used to stamp " Elizabeth Good Fresh Butter Taste It " on bars of butter sold for table use. // A wonderful example of fraktur - the quirky calligraphy used , with folksy decorations , on ceremonial certificates recording births , baptisms , marriages and so forth - is the birth and baptismal record for Elisa Adam , displayed in a section of the show called " Pockets of Settlement . " Done in ink and watercolor on paper by an anonymous calligrapher known as " The Mount Pleasant Artist , " this handsome design of formalized elements in gold , terra cotta and brown is topped by a clock recording the time of the child ' s birth in 1833 . Other items in this section , which deals with the settlements spread across the state , include an engraved silver tureen ( 1790 ) , made by Peter Getz , a prominent silversmith of Lancaster , and 18th-century grandfather clocks made in Lebanon and York , Pa. // The folksy , informal quality of Pennsylvania German design lends itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleenex boxes strewn with hens and hearts . By presenting the original work in the flesh , so to speak , this wellresearched and beautifully installed exhibition gives us a fresh sense of its original vigor. //
