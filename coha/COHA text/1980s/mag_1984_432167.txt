 | Thursday , September 29 , 1983 I woke up earlier than my wife , Niki and went downstairs to let the dog and two cats and read the newspaper . Niki and I had lived in Washington , D.C. , for almost nine years ; we had met in this city 16 years before when we were student interns ? Niki for an investment banking firm and I for a congressman . Now I was a United States senator from Massachusetts and Niki was a law-school student on extended leave to bring up our family . I had won six elections ? the first to the Lowell , Mass. , City Council , the last to the U.S. Senate . WouId there be a next step up the political ladder ? As I started reading the paper Molly , our two year old , began wailing in her crib , and I went upstairs . Niki was already with her , but the clamor had awakened Ashley , nine , and Katina , six . As Niki presided over the bedlam I went to shower and shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the polls for me were good , you never take any election lightly . It was while showering that I felt the lump in my groin . " Damn . " The last thing I needed at this point was a hernia . I had become a runner in the mid-1960s , and I knew a hernia would kill my hopes for running in the 1984 Boston Marathon . I got out of the shower , shaved , dressed , and went downstairs . I told Niki about the hernia on the way out of the house . It 's not fair , I thought . How did I acquire a hernia with all my exercising ? I got in the car and drove to my office at the Capitol . Later that morning I went to see the Capitol physician , Admiral Freeman Cary . He felt the lump , then examined me all over . He did not know what the lump was , he said , but was sure it was not a hernia . He would have to do some tests , starting with a blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said and talked about various infections . I felt a surge of fear . " Well , what is the range of things we might be dealing with ? " I asked . The question was cool and detached . My voice was not . Dr. Cary went into a discussion that included lymph nodes and Hodgkin 's disease . When he was finished , he said he would phone me as soon as the tests came back , and I returned to my office . Dr. Cary called me that afternoon to tell me that my blood tests were negative . The easiest answers to explain the lump were not the answers . It  | would take a couple of days to test for more complicated possibilities . I thanked him , hung up , and felt the return of my original fear . What could it be ? I phoned Niki and told her everything . We decided that an infection was the only logical answer , that there was really nothing to worry about . Yet , that night I did not sleep well . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hodgkin 's disease . I did not want to read about it . I did not want to talk about it . Tuesday , October 4 , 1983 Dr. Cary called me and informed me that all the tests had come back negative . They had n't found the answer , but he wanted to see me right away . Later at his office Cary examined me again , then took a chest X-ray . " I want you to be seen by a specialist , " he said finally . He called Bethesda Naval Hospital and made an appointment the next day with a Dr. Shen . Cary made it clear that Hodgkin 's was the focus of attention . When I got home , I told Niki about the tests and the appointment with Shen . She asked me whether I planned for her to be there too . " Well , I do n't think so . I 'll let you know what he says , " I answered . That was a mistake . Niki was furious at me for wanting to cope with the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be affected as well , and for trying to brave it " like a man . " Was I embarrassed to bring my wife ? she asked . I was taken aback . That was when I realized the difference between a sympathetic ear and a partner in distress . It was a reversal of roles . Niki was now the rock . Till now our life together had pretty much flowed according to my career needs . Niki had given up law school to raise our family . She did her job well , but our society does n't really celebrate a parent who rears children with devotion . " And what do you do ? " she would often be asked in career-oriented Washington . " I 'm raising our children . " " Oh , " would come the uncomfortable reply . Somehow I had grown to accept the routine . But this new situation called for a different strength . My supply of it was deficient . Niki 's was n't . Wednesday , October 5 , 1983 Niki and I drove to the Bethesda Naval Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me there were swollen lymph nodes in my neck and my underarms . Veach also showed me my chest X-rays and the areas of concern there . My alarm escalated . It was not just one lump . They were all over my body . In Veach 's office Niki and I discussed with the doctors Hodgkin 's disease and other possibilities . I tried to ask the expected questions . Niki was more aggressive . Armed with the information she had accumulated , she was able to ask the proper clinical questions and get detailed answers . I remember looking over at this beautiful mother of my three children and thinking , " Boy , are you strong . " Dr. Veach said he wanted to perform a biopsy as soon as possible . Friday was the first available time . Thursday , October 6 , 1983 Thursday morning I opened my office drawer that contained all my personal financial records and began to calculate  | my net worth , my life insurance ( under the Senate plan ) , and what financial shape I would leave Niki and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the numbers like a starved castaway over bread crumbs . The numbers made it clear that Niki could not afford to continue living in Washington . The mortgage payments on the house were just too prohibitive . She would have to sell the D.C. house and return to the house we kept in Lowell , Mass . What would she want to do ? What about finishing law school ? It would be very tight . Friday , October 7 , 1983 Niki and I met with the surgical team who then performed the biopsy . The tests would give us some clues by the afternoon . Dr. Veach called me at my office later . The tests were just preliminary , he cautioned , and the full results would not be in until Tuesday , but he wanted to tell me what they knew at this point . His words were measured . I had nodular lymphoma . " It is not ( pause ) benign . " " It is not benign . " What an interesting way of saying " It is malignant . " They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change . Veach went on to describe the various possibilities of treatment . Much would depend upon whether the lymphoma was " indolent " or whether it had become aggressive . It was probably treatable , but not curable . I hung up the phone and sat in silence . A new part of my life had begun ? a future that would be different from the past . I called Niki at home . In a voice I thought calm , I relayed the information in clinical , detached terms . " Well , we 're just going to beat it , that 's all , " she said . " Come home . " I called Dennis Kanin ( my chief aide ) and Rich Arenberg ( a staff member ) to come into my office and close the door . I told them the news . " It is malignant . " They were absolutely lost for words . What do you say to someone in those circumstances ? There was no use in going through the pretense of normality . I cancelled appointments for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . That afternoon as Niki and I sat on our bed , waves of anger and frustration and hopelessness washed over us . All I could be thankful for was Niki and her strength and her love . While Ashley and Katina played downstairs and Molly slept in the next room , the absorption of the reality of cancer began : How long will I live ? I 'm only 42 years old . Molly wo n't even remember me . Saturday , October 8 , 1983 The first full day of the new era . Just sitting around and allowing events to swirl around my head was debilitating . We decided to take advantage of the beautiful fall day and take a picnic lunch to the Potomac River . I lay on a large rock next to the river , basking in the sun . How many sunny days would I have ? I turned and looked back to Niki and the children as they played . I watched them achingly ? not in the normal sense of observing but in the sense of devouring ? trying to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious , more memorable . It was the first time I had ever envisioned them without me . On the rock , too far away to be part of them , I watched a scene which could easily have occurred with me gone . At first I was sad . How wonderful they all were ? and how much I yearned to be there always . I realized that scenes like this ? the four of them alone ? had taken place throughout the last nine years when I was away and had not been able to partake of this magic . Not because of cancer , but because of the priority of my career . Now politics was utterly secondary . Around me were other families , some with fathers . I wondered if those fathers really appreciated the moment . Where were the fathers who were not  | there ? What could be more important than being here with their families ? Eventually my moroseness gave way to a new awareness . I was looking at a very workable unit . The children were playing and I was warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live and too much to offer to be imprisoned with prolonged grief . The realization filled me with comfort . As I stepped off the rock to return to my family I slipped into the water and got wet . Everyone roared . The fact that Niki could laugh at me so unabashedly , given what she knew , was delightful . Normalcy ? wonderful normalcy ! Sunday , October 9 , 1983 We drove to church . Niki and I found ourselves swimming in emotions . We were n't just attending services , we needed them . Afterward while the children attended Sunday school , we walked across to the National Cathedral to wander in its garden . The time had come for some decisions . We talked and talked , and when we had finished , several things were clear . First we would move back to our house in Massachusetts . That was where home and family were , a community we loved deeply . After nine years , we felt we had experienced Washington fully . Second we decided to sell the D.C. house . Third Niki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she was going to be the breadwinner some day , the law degree was essential . Finally we decided that it made no sense for me to run again for the Senate . What we were dealing with here was life ? not issues , not job satisfaction , but with the question of how long I would live . Political ambition seemed irrelevant . Another reason was purely logistical . If the family was back in Massachusetts , I would n't want to live in Washington by myself three or four nights a week . We returned to the church , retrieved the children , and went home . After we had put them to bed , Katina woke up and cried out . I went into her room to see what the matter was . It turned out to be a nightmare and she was soon asleep . But as I lay next to her on the bed , I wondered whether I should have responded . Would it have been better not to help her , to let her begin to learn to do without me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the office . The Friday findings were confirmed . I had nodular poorly differentiated lymphoma . The type was indolent . They would have to test the enlarged lymph nodes to determine treatment . There were three possibilities : no treatment , treatment , and very aggressive treatment . The lymph nodes might respond to treatment and might not . Then came the words that exploded in my head : " There is no evidence that treatment affects survival , " and " this form of lymphoma has never been cured . " Never been cured . I had to force myself to listen to the words that followed . I would be examined every month or two . When the disease became aggressive , there would be pain , swelling , fever , and chills . It would be necessary to check into Bethesda Hospital for a few days to undergo tests . We agreed that I would go the next morning . I hung up the phone and began the rapid descent into despair . What was there to fight for ? Later at home I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stoic . " I do n't really care that I wo n't live long enough to see my grandchildren , " I said , resorting to sheer falsehood in a search for solace . " Well , I do , " she came back . Of course she did . And of course I did . I wanted to live . I wanted a chance to fight for my life .  | Wednesday , October 12 , 1983 At the hospital Dr. Shen conducted tests to determine whether the disease had spread to the bone marrow . Afterward I was admitted to the hospital . After Niki left , Dr. Shen came in to report that he had not spotted any cancerous cells in the preliminary bonemarrow specimen . My God , there 's actually good news ! I was now ready to ask the question I had been unable to pose before . " How long can I expect to live ? " That was the question , of course . The question made Dr. Shen nervous , but I gave him no escape . Reluctantly he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " Eight years ! My heart leaped . Anyone at age 42 given such a prognosis would be crushed . Not me . I was elated . Eight years ! Dr. Shen explained that it was just an average , that it could be less and it could be more . I did n't care . Now I had a number to focus on . And it was higher than I had expected . He also said he would probably recommend a course of no treatment , but that was subject to further tests and discussion with other doctors . When Dr. Shen left , I called Niki with the news . Then I called Nick Rizzo , my chief fund raiser and a good friend , to tell him what was going on . When I told Nick I was not going to run for the Senate again , he strongly disagreed with the decision , arguing that I was putting myself and my family in great financial risk . " What would you do if you were n't in the Senate ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to stay in the Senate , for Niki 's sake and for the children . " The notion of leaving Niki financially strapped with three children to raise weighed heavily on me . It had never entered my mind during these two weeks that cancer was more than a dreaded disease ? it was also a stigma . Besides , I loved the Senate . Was I making an emotional decision I would later regret ? I promised to think about it and not make any decision under this kind of stress . " One decision stands , " I said .  | " We will move back to Massachusetts . " After the call I went for an X-ray , and then , back in my room , Niki said she thought I should run for the Senate again . We talked about it , and I began to want to run . But how would people respond to a senator with cancer ? By the time Niki left , we had decided that I should stand for reelection . Not because of the financial reasons but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove home . The emotional roller coaster was going up again . ored after December 31 , ferent empty house since Niki and the Saturday , October 15 , 1983 Niki was pleased that I was flying to Boston to get back on schedule . " Get out there and get back to normalcy . We 'll miss you , but we 'll be okay . " again I was struck by her strength . Whatever I had to face , I would not be alone . I attended a fund raiser in Concord , Mass. , that evening . I had assumed that being among my friends would warm me . But here in the midst of long-standing friendship , I felt alone . My secret had set me apart and made me feel " different . " Later at a dinner in Boston I experienced the same feeling of alienation . Sunday , October 16 , 1983 By 7:25 P.M. I was on a plane returning to Washington . The weekend was over . Reflecting on it , I decided that twelveand-a-half months of this kind of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home every weekend as well as some weekdays . After that , weekdays in Washington in a difchildren would move to Lowell . And if I won ? six more years of it . Some prize . Arriving home was a joy . The children normally would be in bed by 8:00 P.M. , but Niki had kept them up and had orchestrated a fond welcome . It was corny and overplayed and great . Saturday , October 22 , 1983 Niki and I flew to Boston to confer with Dr. George Canellos at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute . My tests from Bethesda had been sent to him for further evaluation . He confirmed the basic findings . The type of lymphoma I had was quite treatable . It had not been cured before , although there were rare instances of  | total remissions . Many people had the disease and lived for years without treatment . When and if it became aggressive , I would get some chemotherapy to knock it back down . And the chemotherapy would not be debilitating . Since the lymph nodes in the armpits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to be treated at this time . " What about the eight-year life expectancy ? " I asked . Eight years was only a statistical average , and indeed the more recent data would suggest twelve or more . Niki and I absorbed the information ? and the hope . " Well , what do you think I should say when I announce publicly that I have this ? " I asked . He looked at me with surprise . " I would n't announce it . The public has a right to know about the lymphoma when and if it begins to affect you or when you are receiving treatment . People look at cancer like some medieval disease and just ca n't deal with it . " He went on to describe his anger about the ignorance surrounding cancer . " And what about your children ? " he persisted . if you announce it , you 'll have to tell them . Is it fair to them when you probably will be all right for a long time ? " The idea of hiding the disease was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark , and when Niki reinforced them , the issue was decided in favor of secrecy . We thanked Canellos and went out to the car . Niki had been right all along . Right about being optimistic and right about the value of sharing all this together . It had been a hellish 24 days , but probably the closest 24 of our 14 years together . We had learned a great deal about a lot of things ? including each other . As November proceeded along , my focus returned to the campaign . Then in midNovember I noticed a discomfort in the back of my neck . It had to be a swelling lymph node . By the third day the pain had subsided . But the episode did destroy the illusion that the lymphoma was an issue on the back burner for many years . During December the various lymph nodes swelled and receded . A constant presence but nothing too frightening . My doctors were not concerned . I set aside two weeks in my schedule to spend the Christmas holidays in Lowell . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 11 months later . It was a joyous time . Dinner together every night , no rushing for airports , no schedule . At night we would put the children to sleep after baths and stories . I thought about how many of these moments I had foregone on my climb to political success and how many I would forego as I continued that climb . After the children were put to bed , Niki and I would talk about the enjoyment of being together like this . We had experienced the power and the excitement of national politics . But in the next room , asleep , were what gave us true joy . And each other . On Monday , January 2 , we drove back to Washington . The next morning I said good-bye and headed for the airport to return to Boston for three full days of campaigning . That night I returned alone to the Lowell house after a very full day . I lay in bed thinking how different a house feels when your family 's not there . The night before it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was empty and lonesome . In June the family would be here permanently . The house would be happy .  | But I would be in Washington at least three nights a week . We would rent our home there , and I would live in my uncle 's house . I thought about six-anda-half years ( assuming I won reelection ) of driving to his house at night and going to bed surrounded by silence , while Niki was in Lowell trying to keep the family and law school in balance . The prospect was gloomy . Friday , January 6 , 1984 I flew back to Washington . Niki had weathered the three days ' separation better than I , but not by much . That evening Niki went upstairs to put Molly to bed . Later Ashley , Katina , and I went up as well . I read Katina one of her storybooks , turned out the light , and lay there with her . She talked for a while but soon fell asleep . I put the blankets around her and left . Ashley was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . Then she nestled in my arms till she fell asleep . And I thought about the three nights alone in Lowell . I began to realize how unworkable it all was . Here , with these people , I was happy . Here was where I received my fulfillment . The idea of years of separation depressed me . The family 's staying in Washington was no better a solution . Niki had a year invested in law school at Boston University ; it would not be transferable . And we could n't afford to stay here . I got up from the bed , tucked Ashley into the blankets , and walked into the bedroom , where Niki lay awake in the darkness . I lay down on the bed and stared up at the ceiling . " I think we 're going to have to think about not running again . " " What did you say ? " Niki and I talked at length . It was a discussion , but in a strange way the conclusion had been settled before we began . A need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the Senate , not just Washington . We had to go home in the truest sense of going home . The decision seemed so natural , so right . Odd was the fact that the cancer itself had no serious part in the decision . The cancer had only caused me to understand what truly made me happy . What counted were Paul and Niki and Ashley and Katina and Molly . Everything else was secondary . Saturday , January 7 , 1984 We gathered the children around us to tell them I was not going to run again for the Senate . " I want to spend more time with all of you , " I said . " But , Daddy , " Ashley said , " we 've gotten used to your being away . " My heart sank . That was not a response I expected . It would take time to get her accustomed to my not being away ? and I was now determined to invest that time . Dennis Kanin came over that morning to help work out the details of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce publicly . We decided I 'd mention " health concerns " but not be specific . Thursday , January 12 , 1984 Niki , Nick Rizzo , and I drove to the State House in Boston , where I was to announce my retirement from politics ? my last hurrah . I tried to figure out how to control my emotions during the press conference . Gardner Auditorium was packed ? friends , campaign supporters , staff , State House politicos , reporters . I felt a sense of grateful comradeship for their covering me all these years . I reached the bank of microphones and was surrounded by what seemed a dozen TV cameras . I read my prepared statement , and when it was over , I answered questions ? a lot of softball questions from sympathetic reporters .  | Then it came . " Senator , what kind of illness do you have ? " The question shattered the illusion that the matter of my health would evaporate . I answered by saying that the story was a " political one , not a medical one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if anyone even cares about it . " But I knew this was not the end . The truth would be discovered once reporters were assigned to the task . And I knew that if the story came out , I wanted it to be the whole truth . As Niki and I left the auditorium , people were crying and hugging us . We got on the plane for Washington feeling very good about what had happened . It was the right decision . The children had been staying with friends , and we drove to their house . Ashley ran up to greet me . " Daddy , they 're talking about you in school ! They 're saying you 're sick . " Our hearts dropped . They had heard the news from outside after all . Damn ! Once home , we put Molly to bed and then sat down with Katina and Ashley and outlined the entire story . As Niki referred to the cancer , they reacted with great concern , but as she explained the details they began to feel less threatened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . A few days later I sat down with reporters from the Boston Globe and gave them an interview . The story of my illness was complicated and I did n't want the whole point of why I was leaving the Senate to be lost . The following Sunday I awoke with the knowledge that people were reading the details of my cancer . What would they think ? The phone began to ring . Call after call . The article was all we could have hoped for . By going public I had taken away some of the mystery and stigma of cancer . The mail I would later receive from cancer victims made me certain I had taken the right course . For Niki and me it was liberating . By the time a month had passed , I was talking to several universities about teaching positions , had arranged to meet with several Boston law firms , and had begun to establish a realestate-development partnership in Lowell . I recalled my earlier fears about being unemployable . The cancer was significant , but my mind and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manageable . Strange about the cancer . It caused me to face up to the fact that I will die some day . It made me think about wanting to look back without regret whenever that happened . It made me appreciate Niki 's strengths as I had never quite done before . I am blessed with a marriage that provides meaning . I would now look at my wife and " see " her in a way one does not in the rush of everyday life . The lymphoma made me realize the preciousness of the moments in a child 's development . I would have spent too much time away from my daughters had I continued my career . I would not have helped Ashley on her science project or been with Katina on her Brownie weekend camping trip or had Molly fall asleep in my arms in the hammock . Life is a search for balance . We all have to bring the scales back to center . These changes ? or more accurately reinforcements ? are a precious gift . The cancer gave them to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Every day I know the fragility of my health and my mortality . But , in truth , my great worry is that I will lose my current sense of values and perspective as the nightmare of October 1983 fades from memory . If I 'm symptom-free for a long time , will I go back to the mind set I had before the " hernia " ? I pray not . I want always to feel as I do now .
