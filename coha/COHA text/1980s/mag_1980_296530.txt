HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT Directed by James Caan Screenplay by Spencer Eastman <P> It is easy to think of James Caan as just another pretty face : a pleasant , inoffensive actor who is just right for light entertainments like Chapter Two . It is brave enough for him to play the leading role &shy; that of an inarticulate factory worker &shy; in Hide in Plain Sight , since it is the kind of small , sober film no agent would regard as a good career move . " But this is also Caan 's debut as a director . To choose this true story of a man trying to find and then recover his children , who have been abducted by no less an institution than the U.S. Government , shows real courage . Both Caan 's performance , which is low-key and well observed , and his direction , which is similar in spirit , more than justify his choice . This is a consistently engrossing film on several levels . <P> It enters a milieu , that of working-class life , that the movies often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tire factory . His car is dilapidated , and the house his wife and kids inhabit ( he is divorced ) is , at best , humble . Life for him is a few beers with the boys after work , a Saturday-night dance at the union hall and a little amateur baseball on Sunday afternoon . As director , Caan reveals the character with a sympathy that never patronizes . As an actor , he shows him as a good-natured fellow sustained by simple loyalties . Hacklin had uncomplainingly done his time in the service , just as he now uncomplainingly does his time at the factory , sustained by an unexamined trust in family , friends and country . He is a victim benignly unaware of his victimization . <P> Then his ex-wife marries a small-time Mafia hood who is persuaded by the Justice Department to inform on his colleagues . He is promised a new life and identity in return for his testimony . One night the crook , his bride and Hacklin 's children ( Heather Bicknell , Andrew Fenwick ) are spirited away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his children , it blocks his efforts to find them . The conspiracy is expensive and sophisticated ; Hacklin is poor and simple . But Caan refuses to heighten this classic confrontation between soulless bureaucracy and the individual who has no weapons on his side . Dramatically , the underplaying of Hacklin 's frustrations may be a mistake ; one yearns for a scene in which Caan busts loose , gives full vent to his pain and anger . Yet there is something touching in his patience , his refusal to generalize his case into an indictment of society . The discontinuity between the care the Government is willing to lavish on a helpful hood and its indifference to a good but anonymous citizen who is impeding one of its grand designs comes across more strongly through understatement . So does the point that a father , when threatened , can be as fierce in his love for his children as any mother . <P> The picture is very well played at every level . Jill Eikenberry as Hacklin 's second wife manages to make an impact playing an essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of this film . It tugs gently at one 's sleeve . There is not a more satisfactory moment to be seen now on any screen than Hacklin 's reunion with his children . One does not cheer , but one leaves the theater feeling just fine .
