A buyer for Lehman Brothers <P> In its no-pictures , print-only television commercials , Shearson/American Express calls itself the stockbroker for the " serious investor . " Last week the firm did some serious investing of its own . Only ten days after he had read in FORTUNE that Wall Street 's Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb might be for sale , Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen , 37 , signed an agreement to buy the old-line investment banker for $360 million . The combined companies will be known as Shearson Lehman/American Express . <P> The deal adds some important new aisles to the financial supermarket that American Express is assembling and brings an abrupt end to the 134-year-old history of Lehman Brothers as an independent investment banker . Founded in Montgomery , Ala. , in 1850 by three immigrant brothers from Bavaria , Lehman Brothers moved its main office to New York City after the Civil War and soon established itself as a major investment firm . It helped finance such struggling young companies as Sears , Roebuck and Pan American World Airways , and one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State and in the U.S. Senate . <P> During the past few months , however , Lehman Brothers has been roiling . A split over management and pay policies developed between its investment bankers , who manage the firm 's traditional corporate business , and its traders , who buy and sell stocks and bonds . Three key banking partners have left , and others have reportedly been threatening to pull out . The remaining partners feared that more defections might be on the way . <P> The turmoil at Lehman Brothers was caused by Chairman Lewis Glucksman , 58 . Glucksman is an uncompromising competitor who gets to the office each day before 6 a.m . He joined the firm in 1963 after working as an arbitrager with A.G. Becker , a stock brokerage . Eventually , he moved into securities trading and built it into one of Lehman 's most profitable areas , at the same time making a reputation for himself as a sharp , shrewd analyst of financial markets . <P> Last May Glucksman was appointed co-chief executive with Chairman Peter Peterson , 57 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peterson was well respected on Wall Street , but Glucksman hankered for his job . Said he : " This firm has been my life , and I had just one ambition to run it . " In July Glucksman went to Peterson and told him that he wanted the top job for himself . Publicly denying that there was any friction between the two men , Peterson obligingly stepped aside and took with him a financial settlement estimated to be $15 million . Glucksman 's nervy initiative was accepted by the Lehman board after the fact . <P> Glucksman then set about recasting Lehman Brothers in his own image . He appointed as president another trader , Robert Rubin . The two handed out higher year-end bonuses to other traders than to investment bankers . When partners began pulling out and trading profits suddenly shrank , the board voted to put the firm up for sale .
