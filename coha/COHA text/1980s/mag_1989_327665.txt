It seemed a mad gamble : a $12 million epic about an eccentric English adventurer on the fringe of World War I , set in the sere deserts of the Middle East . It was hell to shoot : 18 months in the singeing sun of Jordan , Morocco and Spain . It had an obscure actor in the title role and no speaking parts for women . When it opened in New York City during the 1962 newspaper strike , one of the film 's few reviewers , Andrew Sarris , called it " dull , overlong and coldly impersonal . . . hatefully calculating and condescending . " <P> How sweet the balm of history . Like its half-mad hero , Lawrence of Arabia defied the odds and won  --  seven Oscars , to be exact . And like T.E . Lawrence , the Oxford-bred English lieutenant who led a Bedouin revolt against the colonial Turks , David Lean 's film has grown in legend . Critics revere it as the cinema 's greatest epic , and a young generation of filmmakers fondly cite its achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful films ever made , " says Martin Scorsese , whose Last Temptation of Christ was a Lawrence on the cheap . " The day before I saw it , " says Steven Spielberg , who was 15 at the time , " I thought I wanted to be a surgeon . The day after , I knew I wanted to be a director . Whenever I want to see what great films used to be like , I watch Lawrence . " <P> Now moviegoers can see Lawrence in its pristine splendor . One more movie hero , film archivist Robert A. Harris , spent years sifting through 3 1/2 tons of film to reconstruct Lean 's film , which , like the stone monuments of the Sahara , had been eroded by time . On this gorgeous Lawrence , with its sparkling 65-mm prints and crisp Dolby sound , Harris was the producer and the chief surgeon . Next week the film has gala premieres before opening in New York City , Washington and Los Angeles . <P> Robert Bolt 's eloquent , epigrammatic script traces Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters to masterminding Arab nationalism . In Peter O'Toole 's pensive , swashbuckling incarnation , Lawrence makes for a curious messiah . With his skin like a mandarin orange dipped in sand , his voice intimate and cryptic , his haunted eyes staring from inside his burnoose , O'Toole creates a towering , tragic , high-camp sheik of Araby . <P> In 1962 Lawrence was the ultimate epic  --  cinema at the apex of its ambition and intelligence . Lavish in visual beauty , the film also boasts economy of style : it knows how much can be shown in a shot , how much can be said in a few words . But the picture was a harbinger too . If Lawrence was the last colonial God-man , he was also the movie epic 's first moody hero , father to countless sacred screen madmen . And in the picture 's political wrangling and massacre scenes , we see hints of American history in the late ' 60s and American movies today : a preview of Viet Nam and a prequel to Platoon .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
