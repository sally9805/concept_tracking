 | Defcon one ! Defcon one ! " " Arm the platforms . " " Platforms armed . Scanners active . We have eightyfour in the envelope . " " They 're launching ! Bad guys in all sectors ... Beast says launches are confirmed . " " Turn ' em loose ! Twenty more platforms coming over the horizon . They 'll try for the strays . " Six hundred miles up , dotting the black sky from horizon to horizon above Soviet intercontinental missile fields , 84 U.S. satellites ? space-based interceptor platforms ? prepare to disgorge their loads of five-foot-long missile killers . Data streaming down from a geostationary boost surveillance and tracking satellite ( BSTS , or " beast " ) feed target coordinates and trajectories to each platform 's battlemanagement computer . Seconds later , with climbing Soviet missiles in their sights , the interceptors fire their smal and extraordinarily powerful rocket engines . Now the chase is underway . It wo n't last long . Each interceptor is a multi-stage missile topped by a " smart rock , " or kinetickill vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the first stage probably goes from zero relative velocity to more than 6,000 mph in under 30 seconds ? the missiles race downward . Centered in an interceptor 's advanced sensor eyes , the fiery exhaust plume of a climbing ICBM ( intercontinental ballistic missile ) glows intensely . The interceptor 's second stage kicks in and the gap between killer and target shrinks dramatically as closing velocity now approaches seven miles per second . Smaller " divert " rockets bristling from the kill vehicle fire in bursts like machine guns , nudging the interceptor 's trajectory as its sensors discriminate the target 's hard body from its plume . With only moments left until hit or miss , the second stage separates , and the oddly shaped smart rock is on its own . There 's barely time for the divert rockets to execute their final corrections before the diving space bullet and the climbing ICBM reach a common point at the edge of the atmosphere . Then it 's over . The kinetic-kill vehicle carries no explosives . But even if it only grazes an ICBM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . A rage of exploding fuel and shredded  | metal blossoms in the thin atmosphere high over Soviet territory . Among the debris , undetonated nuclear warheads tumble back to Earth . Elapsed time since the war began : four minutes . But some ICBMs have escaped and released their nuclearwarhead reentry vehicles . In the next four minutes more interceptor platforms come into range and attempt to engage those individual warheads coasting through their midcourse phase on the way to the continental United States . If the system works as planned most of them do their jobs . But even the most optimistic supporters of the interceptor program assume that about 10 percent of the nuclear weapons would elude the interceptors and need to be tackled by other Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) systems . Missile shield or pipe dream ? Is this scenario wishful thinking ? Something dreamed up by the Reagan administration and the aerospace industry to funnel more than $550 million worth of research into an impractical element of SDI ? Or are space-based interceptors a realistic possibility ? an anti-missile system that might prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ever gets to the war-alert status of defense condition ( defcon ) one ? If they are , interceptors could become the earliest operational phase of SDI , while research and development continues on other systems . These include laser and particle-beam weapons and last-ditch high-energy missiles aimed at warheads that slipped through the net . To find out , I talked with SDI officials in their basement headquarters at the Pentagon , and with engineers at the Martin Marietta Corp . near Denver and at Rockwell International Corp . in Southern California , where competing designs for kinetic-kill vehicles are taking shape . The program is a costly one , regardless of whose numbers you accept . Rockwell estimates the system 's 10-year operational cost at $20 billion , while Aviation Week &; Space Technology reports the U.S. Air Force thinks it will cost $80 billion . I also talked with leading SDI critics , who view the program with strong skepticism and say that the Pentagon 's push to deploy missile interceptors by the mid-1990s is the wrong way to go . One surprising fact emerged : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere threat of its existence is enough to help negotiate appropriate peace treaties ? everyone ( including the contractors , who would rather explore space than fight in it ) will be happy . " The job of the American military is not to win wars , but to prevent them , " said Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson , director of SDI , at a press briefing last year in Los Angeles . " But right now we ca n't stop one incoming missile . Not one . " That makes space-based interceptors key power pieces in the ongoing strategic chess game . Behind closed doors and with no advance notice , the United States moved anti-missile weapons onto the playing board during last December 's Washington summit meeting . Less than 48 hours before Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev , chief of the Soviet general staff , made an unprecedented visit to the Pentagon , Abrahamson asked Rockwell and Martin Marietta to rush their full-scale interceptor models to the capital . No mention of the models was made in briefings to reporters , but they were in prominent view during Akhro- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adm . William J. Crowe , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff . The marshal 's reaction ? " He just stared at them , " a Pentagon spokesman told me . " He did n't say a thing " But he probably got the message . Even so , if missile interceptors are to serve as an effective bargaining chip , they must be real . A little-known SDI test in space in September 1986 gave Abrahamson and his team the confidence to bet more than half a billion dollars that they can work . In that test SDI launched a specially modified and instrumented Delta rocket into low orbit . The Delta 's second and third stages separated and then moved nearly 140 miles apart . Both stages carried packages of sensors taken from operational weapons systems . As the stages crossed the Pacific , controllers turned them to face each other , then fired their main engines . One stage mimicked an enemy ICBM . The other played the role of kinetic killer , picking up the rocket flare in a sensor eye from a Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accelerating stage in the night sky over Kwajalein Atoll . The high-speed collision shredded both stages . For SDI , the spectacular explosion proved to be a promising demonstration . It also was enough to prove to Abrahamson , if not to SDI 's vocal critics , that intercepting a rocket in space was possible . But an operational system would be much different from the Delta test ; it would have as many as 300 platforms in orbit , each containing 10 to 20 miniature interceptors That would be a complex undertaking that some say would still not be up to the task . For example , a recent study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory concluded that about 100,000 orbiting interceptors would be required to destroy 90 percent of the 14,000 strategic nuclear warheads the Soviet Union is expected to be capable of launching in a massive strike in the mid-1990s . " We 're trying to do something in space that 's never been done before , " said Lloyd Stoessell , manager of space-based kinetic-kill vehicles at SDI 's Pentagon headquarters . The large number of platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only one-third or so of them would be in an imaginary " envelope " over Soviet missile fields at any moment . Others would be on the way , but that 's not good enough when ICBMs are climbing through the clouds . Exactly nine months after the Delta test SDI issued matching four-year $150-million contracts to industry teams headed by Martin Marietta and Rockwell to develop interceptor systems . Rockwell got an additional $250 million to stage a flight test from Kwajalein late next year . It will launch a test-bed vehicle loaded with newly developed sensors , then turn it around to intercept a secand rocket during its boost phase . Yet another space test was launched last February atop a Delta rocket . It carried a mixed payload of sensors , detoys , and simulated Soviet missiles . The mission gathered information on what warheads might look like after separating from their ICBM booster . Much of that data will be used for SDI elements that would attempt to knock @#  | out targets that the interceptors missed . Some of the sensors tracked the plumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readings on both Earth and sky . That information would feed directly into the space-based interceptor system . These tests have not been popular with SDI critics . " When you commit prematurely to large demonstrations in space you distort the research program , " said accelerator physicist Dr. Sidney Drell , co-director of Stanford University 's Center for International Security and Arms Control . " You freeze the design too soon . Big demonstrations carried out prematurely are good for public relations , but are not good for a research program . " SDI insiders disagree . The space tests are a vital part of their research , they say , providing data that ca n't be simulated accurately in the laboratory . Drell is not opposed to SDI 's long-range goal . " We need a serious research program to determine if it is even feasible , " he told me . " But I 'm worried about the trend that 's concentrating more on near-term deployment than longterm technologies . SDI should be a balanced program . " SDI spokesmen counter by saying that the threat of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate seriously and already has led to significant arms reductions . Of all the SDI elements being considered , only the interceptors have the potential for early deployment . " There are two pieces to the system , " Stoessell told me . " First there are the satellite platforms . Each will have a fixed number of interceptors , communications equipment , power , something to deal with the heat that 's generated , and the ability to move around a bit in orbit . There also will be some other survivability things that are classified " Stoessell envisions Martin Marietta and Rockwell proposing a simple solar-powered platform designed with replaceable modules for in-orbit servicing , perhaps by an automated satellite making periodic rounds . Except for its communications system and its battle-management computer and software ? certain to be among the most expensive and sophisticated components ? a platform 's major feature would be the tubes containing interceptors . With hundreds of identical satellites to be built and orbited , SDI managers recognize that they 're asking the aerospace industry to enter a new phase : mass manufacturing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite program where they build one or two at a time , " Stoessell said . The competing companies are taking sharply different design approaches . Both have created an oddly shaped kinetic-kill vehicle ? the small ungainly smart rock that would actually hit an ICBM ? with space flight in mind . Like the Apollo lunar module , which never had to fly in Earth 's drag-inducing atmosphere , it does n't need to be sleek or curvy . So each design bristles with small rockets and projections , boxy modules , and a forward-looking sensor tube ? like some sort of killer space porcupine . But Dr. Richard L. Garwin , IBM fellow at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center , adjunct professor of physics at Columbia University , and a government consultant on defense technology since the 1950s , has little hope that either Martin Marietta or Rockwell will succeed in creating useful systems . " Anything we know how to build wo n't be cost effective and will be war provoking , " he says . " One of the main reasons is that the interceptor platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Marietta design the kill vehicle sits atop two miniaturized rocket stages . I looked at the full-scale model at a company facility south of Denver and marveled at its compact size ? barely five feet long , 16 inches in diameter , and weighing 150 pounds . The two-foot first stage has a 4,000-pound thrust rocket and enough solid fuel for 10 to 12 seconds of brute-force acceleration . The liquid-fueled second stage is six inches shorter but carries a 600-pound thrust rocket . Both engines , being developed by the U.S. Air Force Astronautics Laboratory in Palmdale , Calif. , are physically small but have unusually high thrust-to-weight ratios that give them faster acceleration while burning less fuel . The engines are likely to find applications in other space programs as well . both military and civilian . The second-stage engine can be stopped then restarted after brief periods of coasting . while an on-board computer refines the intercept trajectory . When the kinetic-kill vehicle , also 18 inches long , separates for the final few seconds of track-and-smash flight , it will be traveling at a speed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaporize itself , " said Martin Marietta 's program director , Richard W. VandeKoppel . " There is no need for ex plosives . " Rockwell 's interceptor package might be called " Michelin Man goes to space . " It looks like a pyramid of doughnuts " Those are toroidal fuel tanks said Dr. John B. Peller , vice president and program director , as he showed me a full-scale interceptor model . " It 's a stage-and-a-half vehicle , with one main engine and two sets of tanks . " Rockwell 's preliminary platform design calls for stuffing the interceptors nose first into storage tubes . Interceptors would pop out backward , then spend several seconds turning around and finding targets before the main engine fired This engine is the same restartable rocket Martin Marietta uses in its second stage . Rockwell hides the engine inside the bottom layer of doughnuts , which are discarded when their fuel runs out . That 's the half stage . Smaller doughnuts carry fuel for mid-flight operations and for the course-correcting divert engines . Barely more than a minute into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinetic-kill vehicle hurtling toward an oncoming ICBM One final fuel ring girdles the kinetic-kill vehicle itself . That ring has just enough fuel for the little machine 's own divert engines to rapidly fire a few final corrections of its aiming point . " By that time you could have closing velocities of up to eight miles per second , " Peller told me . " So your aim had better be right on . " @#  | That 's the hard part . Everyone agrees that hitting an ICBM with an 18-inch smart rock fired from 1,000 miles away will require a variety of technology advances . Many of them are already coming out of development laboratories . " The engines are a good example , " Peller said . " They 're smaller and more powerful than ever . " Rockwell 's Rocketdyne Division has already test-fired both divert engines and attitude-control thrusters for the interceptors . " Fifteen years ago the engine on a Mariner spacecraft weighed 19.4 pounds and had 314 pounds of thrust , " he recalled . " The divert engine weighs 1.7 pounds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five pounds of thrust , weighs less than four ounces . " Much of the improvement comes from using new lightweight alloys and other materials that did n't exist in the 1970s , and from more-efficient designs . Electronics are changing fast too . " Our guidance computer for the flight test does two million calculations a second , but weighs only about one pound , " Peller said . " That will be down to half a pound for an operational system that will be faster . " Divert engines themselves constitute a new technology . The engines are fixed in place and ca n't be swiveled or gimbaled . This makes them simpler . Then how can they make course corrections that may measure a fraction of a degree ? Attitude-control thrusters reposition the entire vehicle before the divert engines fire . It all happens quickly . Needed : powerful software Making the whole system work together is forcing other advances in software . Experts from Logicon , Inc. , developed a battle-management scenario for Rockwell that solved the potential problem of separate platforms firing interceptors at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of calculations that looks at the global picture , assigns values to targets , then sends its own interceptors to the highest values , " said Logicon 's project manager , Allen Atkinson . " There 's an element of autonomy , but you still have complete coordination . " If any platform is destroyed by an anti-satellite weapon , the others record a lost communications link and expand their own coverage to fill the gap . Once it leaves the platform each interceptor will get updates on its target 's location . But its own computer will calculate trajectories and course changes . " The interceptor 's range of target acquisition should be some-@#  | where between fifty and two hundred miles , " VandeKoppel explained . " After that , it 's completely on its own . " To spot targets , both the platforms and the kill vehicles will use highly accurate **25;1015;TOOLONG sensors developed " for other reasons , " Stoessell said , that see across a wide range of the infrared spectrum . Arrayed in a 32-by-64-element focal plane , the sensors provide masses of data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the primary breakthroughs that makes a space-based interceptor possible , " said VandeKoppel . " We actually develop images on board . First we get the ICBM plume , and then , as it comes into view , the hard body . " The processing is handled by a tiny computer called a GAP-based image processor ( for geometric arithmetic parallel ) , which handles 80 billion calculations per second . Despite all the new hardware and software , program critics remain unconvinced that any system will be good enough to intercept an ICBM . At present the program 's primary focus is on catching a liquid-fueled Soviet rocket during its first five minutes of boost . " By the time you have such a thing , " IBM 's Garwin said , " it can be defeated by the Soviets going to solid-fueled rockets with shorter burn times . " Such ICBMs already exist in the Soviet inventory . They accelerate faster than liquid-fueled rockets and burn out after about three minutes . Catching them will be harder , Rockwell and Martin Marietta officials told me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the Soviets might have is an integral part of the job , they say . The debate will continue With the interceptor program less than two years old , both contractors are confident that it will work . But the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment is equally confident that the program will be unable to guarantee protection against missile attack . In a recently released study , it concluded that the system 's complex computer programs would be dangerously failure prone in a nuclear war . The final form of this immensely complex project may not emerge for a number of years . Even if the administration and Congress give SDI 's first phase the go-ahead , it looks as if the original goal of having intercept platforms in orbit by the middle of the next decade is receding toward the millennium . And in the intervening years many technical , budgetary , and diplomatic debates will take place that will affect the outcome . @#
