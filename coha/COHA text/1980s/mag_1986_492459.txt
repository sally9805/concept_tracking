that company , and many of the senior personnel have become remarkably successful in their own right . I had just met an outstanding example : 52-year-old Lloyd Tomer , who recently became one of the A.L . Williams Company 's 27 national sales directors . For most of his life , Lloyd , who looks a bit like the actor Hal Holbrook , had been a pastor in Benton , Illinois . Benton was not a big town , but Lloyd had ministered there to an average congregation of more than 500 . Then , in 1979 , his wife died of cancer , and the grief-stricken pastor watched his flock wither away . By Easter 1980 , he was out of a job and unable to get another church , no matter how hard he tried . In fact , he was discovering that at his age , it was exceedingly difficult to find any kind of steady employment . Lloyd knew he had reached bottom . It was then that he heard of Al . Williams . He took the training course , earned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 5,000 representatives for whom he was responsible . Best of all , his two sons , Scott and Frank , were included among them . " Art Williams encourages us to Live the Dream , ' as he puts it , " Lloyd said , beaming , " and last year my top 20 people averaged earning $100,000 apiece . " He paused . " But you know , the best thing about this job is not the money . It 's the opportunity it gives you to help people . I am helping more people now than I ever was able to help as a minister . " Down on the auditorium stage , a short , balding man in a yellow blazer appeared , and everyone around me stood up and began applauding . For the moment , though , the extraordinary demonstration of affection was not reciprocated . Art Williams was ripping mad . He had just heard that a few of his RVPs had left the rally the night before to smoke cigarettes in the foyer and that they had been rude to an usher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the doors shut ? " he asked . " We 're just family in here ? Good . Because I have something to say to the family . Dadgummit ! " he exploded . " You 're representing the A.L . Williams Company ! You want to smoke during our meeting ? Get off the team ! And if any one of you does n't like the way I 'm talking to you right now , do n't let the doorbang your butt on the way out ! " I could readily appreciate why he had once been named coach of the year . I looked around ; his family understood . I began to understand why they had such respect for him , and why this gathering really did feel more like that of a family than of an executive corps . He had gotten it out of his system , and now he had some electrifying news : Effective immediately , the A.L . Williams Company was offering dramatic increases in coverage to all nonsmoking policyholders . He was , in short , putting his money where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invest the difference " philosophy occupies the major portion of his life , Art Williams is also committed to health and fitness . I visited him at his home in Atlanta a few weeks later . My own high-school football coach once told us that if we were going to win , we had to live , eat , drink , and sleep football . Well , Art Williams lives , eats , drinks , and sleeps the A.L . Williams insurance company . But if he is a bit fixated on the subject , he fortunately has a self-deprecating sense of humor to go with it , one that invariably makes the listener laugh . At the same time , there is no mistaking that he is a fighter inthe " Rocky " mold  --  an underdog who simply refuses to be beaten . " We believe we are doing something good for the families out there , " he exclaimed . " We got a mission , and buddy , we 've got one tough bunch of dudes competing insurance companies to defeat . " I grinned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach Williams stays fit by either walking an hour or running an hour on alternate days , and at the end of my visit , he invited me to join him . I agreed , provided that it was a walking day ; bumper-to-bumper deadlines had curtailed my own fitness program . In a few minutes , he reappeared in shorts , sweat shirt , and running shoes , and I began to have misgivings about what I had gotten myself into . We set off , and within half a mile , I was sweating profusely . Art hardly seemed to be breathing deeply as he expressed his concern for where our country appears to be drifting . His solution : strengthened family ties and a reaffirmation of traditional American values . We must have covered more than five miles in the space of an hour , and I tried not to show my relief as we finally turned into the driveway of the ante-bellum home he and his wife , Angela , have lovingly restored . Conscious of new blisters underfoot , I congratulated him on the personal example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get myself back into shape . Angela later told me she and Art feel strongly about health and nutrition . " We have made two trips to Pritikin clinics , " she said , " one to the West Coast and one in Florida , and we learned a lot about nutrition and diet and exercise . " But neither of them is on a diet , " although Art struggles with it , " she said . This leads to meatless meals  --  lots of vegetables , grains , and fruit . " We leave out eggs and the fried stuff . He 's very happy with potatoes , squash , beans , steamed cabbage , and corn bread  --  and no meat , " Angela said . She even gave me copies of some of her favorite recipes . ( See end of article . ) Angela was the real surprise of that visit . I was astonished at her grasp of the finer points of insurance . And as she related the history of their company  --  of the hard times they had come through and the seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prayer going for them  --  I could see what a support office and introduced me to her staff of five . From the beginning , Angela has endeavored to get out a monthly newsletter to Partners ; it has become a major operation  --  the last mailing had topped 35,000 . In addition , she receives several hundred personal letters a week and makes a point of answering each one with care . A family-counseling service for employees and agents has been a major focus of Art and Angela Williams for the past year and a half . " They 've put together one of the most unique programs in the industry , " a company spokesperson told me . " And it has been a fantastic success . " She explained that sales people on commission work crazy hours , which is not only stressful but a strain on any marriage . So the Al Williams Company has made a major commitment to " what we call our family-and-marriage program . " " Art and Angela personally fund the major cost of the program , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . We have a family-and-marriage counseling session for every meeting . At 8:00 a.m. at all of our conventions , we offer a one-hour family-and-marriage seminar . " The program is optional , she said . The families are free to attend or not , " but you 'd be surprised at the number who choose to do so , " she added . In addition , there is a number the Williams people can call anytime for counseling service . The staff puts them in touch with local counselors . " But the main focus of this counseling , " the spokesperson added , " is on prevention . " My conclusion , after having met Art and Angela , is : If the A.L . Williams Company does succeed in selling 590 billion worth of life insurance , as projected for this year of 1986 , it will not be Williams ' only great accomplishment . In his company as well as in his own life , Art Williams practices what he preaches  --  that good health and good living go hand-in-hand with a healthy financial future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely al- , ' legorical fiction , set in the haze of a mythological past and brimming with magical portent , suggests that its author barricaded herself from the world and chose to live only in the precincts of her imagination . Nothing could be further from the truth . A member of the Danish upper classes , the Baroness Karen Blixen had traveled through worlds both literary and artistic before her wanderlust brought her to a marriage of convenience and a huge coffee plantation in Kenya . She farmed it with little success for 15 years , hosted the Prince of Wales , contracted a lifetime case of syphilis from her husband , got a divorce , fell in love with a classic British adventurer , returned to Denmark , and ( under the pseudonym lsak Dinesen ) became a famous writer . Wracked with pain from the syphilis , she nonetheless kept writing and became the spiritual mother of an entire school of Danish intellectuals . She came to know virtually everyone of importance in the world . And when she died at the age of 77 in 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful , and instantly recognizable figures . She led one of the great lives of the 20th century , and that she chose to make relatively little of it in her own work makes her beautifully composed , somewhat bloodless prose something of a disappointment . For example , her memoir Out of Africa is certainly an amazing piece of work . But if you read Out of Africa after completing Judith Thurman 's exemplary biography , lsak Dinesen : The Life of a Storyteller , you are bound to feel a bit short-changed , as though Dinesen had removed much of the drama from her experience in Kenya to focus instead on her seemingly random observations of life in the wild . There has been much talk during the past two decades about a film based on Out of Africa , but this quintessentially literary work resisted any efforts to translate it to celluloid . Not until Thurman 's book appeared in 1982 could narrative shape be given to the story . And Sydney Pollack'sfilm version of Out of Africa , featuring Meryl Streep in yet another unforgettable performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way she was surprisingly incapable of herself . This film is not biographical in the usual sense ; much of it is fictionalized and many of the real-life characters populating Out of Africa are nowhere in evidence . But if the subject of Dinesen 's Out of Africa was Africa itself , the subject of Pollack 's Out of Africa is what the experience of living in Africa meant to Karen Blixen . And as such , it is always true to its subject and in some ways truer to her experience in Africa than she herself was in her book . We see her first at a desk in Denmark after her return , as the famous opening sentence of the book comes to her " I had a farm in Africa , at the foot of the Ngong Hills . " With a subtlety typical of the film as a whole , Pollack and the screenwriter , Kurt Luedtke , make it clear that the memories we are about to share with her will in some ways lessen the sense of loss that resonates in Streep 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recites that sentence . What follows is a vivid , leisurely retelling of her experience , beginning with 0 her impetuous proposal of marriage to Baron Bror Blixen , the brother of her first great love , and her arrival in Africa in 1913 . The fatally charming Bror ( played by the Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer ) and most of the other Europeans populating Kenya are not looking for a living or for money . They are searching for extremes , suffused with a kind of mad passion for danger and freedom . Outside their homes in Kenya , lions run free and Masai warriors lie in wait . The birds Bror and Karen shot at during the sedate Danish hunting party at which she proposed to him are not the kind of game he wants . He hungers for the exhilarating danger of the safari . Karen is also looking for freedom ? freedom from her stifling Victorian family  --  but she is quite conventional as well . Her family has put up a great deal of money for the farm , and she intends to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakening : Upon her arrival she discovers that Bror has decided to go for coffee instead of cattle and learns that coffee has never been successfully farmed at so high an altitude . " 1 do n't want to live around cows , " he tells her . But the truth is that he does n't want to live around a farm at all . The hunt is in Bror 's blood , and he is ever taking off for a safari , Karen must go it alone , surrounded by the china , crystal , cuckoo clocks , and various homely appurtenances more appropriate for a European manse than a Kenyan coffee plantation . But gradually the intoxications of the wild begin to affect Karen as well . When Bror is off in the British army , fighting the Germans on the African front in World War 1 , Karen is asked to send some provisions to him through the treacherous countryside . She decides to deliver them herself , aided only by a few native Kikuyu . The journey features Masai warriors , charging lions , and blistering heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the soldiers gawking at the appearance of this woman , she has become a native of Africa . On this journey she first comes into extended contact with the great hunter Denys Finch-Hatton ( Robert Redford ) , and their love affair takes up most of the film 's second half . Like Bror , Denys is a European transfixed by the freedom Africa offers ? " We 're just passing through , " he says  --  and his very bohemian view of his relationship with Karen is agonizing to her . He comes and goes as he pleases , a resolutely unreliable partner . Their deliriously romantic liaison is rather like Karen 's entire relationship with Africa itself : It brings meaning and value to her life , but she can never be in possession of it . But she can experience its great beauty . In the film 's most transfixing scene , Denys takes her flying for the first time . In the book , she describes it thus : In the air you are taken into the full freedom of the three dimensions ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into the arms of space . . . Every time that I have gone up in an aeroplane and looking down have realized that I was free of the ground , I have had the consciousness of a great new discovery . " I see , " I have thought , " this was the idea . And now I understand everything . " The movie shows them flying over gorges and caverns and waterfalls , and above a great lake where hundreds of flamingos cover the surface . The transporting beauty of the sight causes Karen to give her hand to Denys . He takes it and squeezes it , and the moment is captured forever in time . The glory of life , Out of Africa tells us , is in moments like these . And the glory of the movie itself is that it captures the magical quality of these moments : the luckless-at-love Karen advising a lively young woman about what love really is ; Karen and Denys sitting at a makeshift table in the clearing of a campsite , eating a good dinner , drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Karen acting Scheherazade and constructing elaborate stories for Denys and his fellow hunter , Berkeley Cole ; Karen saying good-by to her faithful servant , Farah , after 15 years by asking him to call her by her first name . Though Karen does suffer many hardships , though she comes to write a book pregnant with loss , these experiences will be with her always . And that message is at the core of the film version of Out of Africa , which has the courage to tell a story more faithful to the real-life experience of Isak Dinesen than Isak Dinesen 's own version .
