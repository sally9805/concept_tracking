Reagan 's START concessions revive the MX missile <P> When Congress last year killed the dense pack basing plan for the MX , the 96-ton ten-warhead missile seemed permanently grounded . Then the blue-ribbon Scowcroft Commission recommended last month that the U.S. develop a smaller , possibly mobile , single-warhead Midgetman missile . In the meantime , the commission suggested , the U.S. should demonstrate its political will by placing 100 MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos , even though these sites might be vulnerable to attack . Key members of Congress wanted the Midgetman , as well as a more flexible approach to arms control . President Reagan wanted the MX and was willing to make concessions to get it . The result : the MX rose from the ashes last week , while the Midgetman be came part of Reagan 's arms-control equation . <P> The revival of the MX was shrewdly engineered by the President . Reagan lobbied hard in public , declaring on a political foray into Ohio that " if Congress rejects these Scowcroft proposals , it will have dealt a blow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to accomplish . " Then he met privately with legislators who remained skeptical about the MX . He also sent accommodating notes to lawmakers who had asked for changes in the Administration 's negotiating position in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks with the Soviet Union , which are scheduled to resume in Geneva on June 8 . <P> One letter went to nine House Democrats who wanted both super powers gradually to reduce reliance on multiple independently targetable ( MIRVed ) missiles . These missiles are considered destabilizing because they are tempting first-strike targets . The reason : it takes only one incoming warhead to knock out a Hydraheaded missile on the ground . If each side deployed only single-warhead missiles , there would be more targets , and each incoming warhead could hit only one enemy warhead at a time . <P> In his reply , Reagan said he " wholeheartedly " endorsed the single-warhead concept , but he was vague about how he planned to incorporate it into his arms-control policy . He wrote : " We are conducting a review of our START proposal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission 's approach . " <P> A second letter went to Senators Charles Percy and William Cohen , both Republicans , and Sam Nunn , who carries considerable clout on military matters with his Democratic colleagues . Their major interest was to get the President to endorse the idea of a " build-down " in nuclear missiles . As outlined by Cohen in a newspaper article last January , this plan would have each side dismantle two existing warheads every time it deployed a new one . Reagan liked the idea so much that he called the surprised Cohen to suggest that the concept be refined .
