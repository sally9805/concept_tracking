BLOOMINGTON , Minn. - The temptation is to panic . Desperate times require desperate moves and the Bruins ' masterminds , coach Gerry Cheevers and general manager Harry Sinden , are surely thinking and talking a " change in tactics . " Said Sinden yesterday , " You have to hang your hat on something . You can ' t go out back and say , we went with our method and see you next year . ' There are three or four things running around my head - and Cheevers ' too . You might get your head knocked off trying something new and you might win . I ' m not saying we ' ll try anything different , but it ' s worth talking about . " The danger is that when you try something different , to change the way the team plays , you ' re taking it out of what it has done best . A change in the makeup of the lines is a possibility . One change forced on the Bruins is a defense squad of five instead of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no change in goal ; Rogie Vachon will be in there . This is the Bruins ' position : They are down two games to none in a series that requires three wins . And the next two games are in the other team ' s building , here tonight ( 9 p.m. ) and maybe tomorrow night ( 8:30 ) . Both games are slated for Ch. 38 and WITS radio . The Bruins have been outplayed by the Minnesota North Stars , " and maybe we ' ve seen the real Minnesota North Stars , " is Sinden ' s opinion . What Boston saw on Wednesday and Thursday at the Garden was a Minnesota team that lost its innocence of youth in the playoffs last season , and found its maturity in Boston in February . " We made men out of them , " said Sinden . " No one is going to beat us unless they stand up to us . You can ' t run away and hide , and they ' re not running away . They ' ve taken the hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t forget we played two pretty darned good games . " A facet of Minnesota ' s new character became visible in Thursday ' s game when Brad Park and Bobby Smith had a fight . When it ended ( the North Stars had scored ) Smith went to the penalty box gate and hugged Steve Payne . The Boston style is to forecheck aggressively , which puts pressure on its defensemen if all the forwards are in deep and don ' t get the puck . And Boston ' s defensemen are offensive players , which puts pressure on the goalies if the opponents break out quickly . Those are among the reasons for 24 goals in two games . The reason Minnesota has 14 goals is that the North Stars have made the most of their scoring chances . " They ' re a hot-shooting team , " said Sinden . They have given the Bruins more scoring opportunities than coach Glen Sonmor likes and the Bruins haven ' t made the most of them . " We ' ve missed too many tap-ins , " said Sinden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net and our defensemen arebumping into each other up at the blue line and a lot of unusual things are happening . They go your way when you ' re skating well . The North Stars are skating well and shooting well . " The Bruins also have taken too many penalties . " We end up with three penalties to one , whether deserved or undeserved , and if we take 40 shots and get nine penalties , we ' re shorthanded for 18 minutes . We ' ve lost 18 minutes out of our offense and what have we done ? " Lost again . The Bruins ' approach has to be based on positive thinking . It ' s a one- game-at-a-time approach . " We don ' t start the game two goals behind , " said Sinden . " We have to play as though this were the fifth game . For us it is the fifth game . It ' s the elimination game . " The North Stars have taken their two victories in Boston quite professionally . " The games don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Al MacAdam . The line of MacAdam , Tim Young and Payne ( five goals ) has figured in nine of Minnesota ' s 14 goals . " We don ' t want to come back to Boston , " said Young . " We want to finish it ( the series ) at home , " said Payne . " We ' d be cheating ourselves and everybody who wants us to win if we didn ' t finish them off in Minnesota . It would be inexcusble to let them win three in a row . " Said Jack Carlson , " We ' ll end it in three . They ' ll never be able to skate with us in our building . " The North Stars will come back with Gilles Meloche in goal tonight , and they too have to cut down on the scoring opportunities they have been giving the Bruins . " I didn ' t like the six goals they scored , " said Sonmor . He loved the two victories his team took out of Boston .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
