Charter Co. ' s hopes to emerge from bankruptcy-law reorganization proceedings are tied to the fortunes of its oil marketing operations . Under a five-year business plan presented to creditor and shareholder representatives , the Jacksonville , Fla. - based company said it would retain a core group of seven business units . They include Charter ' s gasoline marketing and distributing businesses , and a chain of convenience-store and gasoline outlets . Over the next five years , the plan projects total earnings of $141 million . But it doesn ' t discuss how Charter will pay the $741 million in debt that has been deferred under its filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code . The plan also assumes that Charter will be able to sell its oil refineries and other assets , which may prove difficult because of the current glut of oil and refining capacity . Alexander P. Zechella , Charter ' s president and chief executive officer , said in an interview that the plan is a " point of departure " for developing a reorganization plan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn ' t in a " fire-sale mode , " and has retained outside assistance to help dispose of the units in an orderly fashion . Separately , the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday publicly accused Charter of inflating its earnings from insurance operations by a total of $28. 7 million in 1981 , 1982 and 1983 . Charter , which yesterday completed the sale of its insurance units to Metropolitan Life Insurance Co . , New York , for $52 million , settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt . The agency didn ' t compel the company to restate its earnings . Instead , Charter agreed to file a copy of the agency ' s administrative order , attached to its current annual report , with the SEC . It also agreed to summarize the SEC ' s case in its next quarterly and annual reports . Charter ' s five-year plan projects that annual revenue will decline from $4. 13 billion in 1985 to $2. 5 billion in 1986 , then increase again to $3. 07 billion in 1989 . The document isn ' t the reorganization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t , for example , address creditor claims . It is an analysis of the prospects for Charter ' s businesses , and a statement of management ' s decision about which businesses should be retained and which should be disposed of . The plan projects annual earnings of $43 million this year , $27 million in both 1986 and 1987 , and $22 million in both 1988 and 1989 . Earnings in the early years would reflect proceeds from asset sales . The projections also assume that $20 million of working capital would be available . Under the plan , Charter would divest its Houston refinery and its 50% interest in a large refinery in the Bahamas , although the company said it hasn ' t had firm offers for either property . Charter also would shed the gasoline and distillate wholesale marketing business of its Northeast Petroleum Corp. unit , and liquidate Charter Savings Corp. and all other assets that are not part of any business unit . Among the businesses Charter would retain , according to the plan , are Charter Coal Co . ; New England Petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern ; Northeast Petroleum ' s branded gasoline distribution business and its residual fuel-oil sales business ; Charter ' s oil-production concession in Abu Dhabi ; and Charter Oil Eastern Corp . Mr. Zechella said the reaction to the plan from creditor and shareholder groups " generally has been very good . " Members of those groups have posed a number of questions " none of which has been fatal to the plan , " he said . Representatives of creditor and shareholder groups who could be reached yesterday declined to discuss their reactions to the plan . One analyst said the plan is a " sensible concept " because Charter is planning to get rid of capital-intensive businesses . In its five-year plan , Charter said its interest in the Abu Dhabi concession , which markets crude oil produced from an offshore oil field , can ' t be sold for an amount equal to the net current value of projected cash flows . It said the government of Abu Dhabi has said that the economic benefits associated with the concession aren ' t transferable . In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products sales operation , should be retained because it requires minimal working capital , generates profits and cash flow and provides market intelligence and advisory services to the entire Charter organization . In its administrative proceeding against Charter , the SEC contended that the company should have accounted for single-premium deferred annuities as investment contracts or certificates of deposit rather than as insurance products . Charter sold about $3. 7 billion of the annuities during 1981 , 1982 and 1983 . As a result of its accounting approach , Charter recorded about 35% of its anticipated profit at the time of the annuity sales , the SEC said . Had Charter treated its annuities , which have a typical life of 10 years , as investment contracts , it would have booked profits only as they were earned each year . Charter ' s accounting method inflated 1981 earnings by $6. 2 million , 1982 earnings by $16 million and 1983 earnings by $6. 5 million , the SEC said . Charter reported earnings of $7. 7 million in 1981 , $35. 3 million in 1982 , and $53. 9 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure requirements . The charge related to Charter ' s method of accounting for annuity contracts that were cashed in during 1981 for contracts paying higher interest rates . Had Charter properly accounted for the so-called rollovers , the SEC said , it would have reduced Charter ' s pre-tax 1981 income by $7 million . Under the settlement , the company agreed to comply with SEC rules that require management to explain its decisions and actions fully to shareholders .
