U.S. torpedoes test-ban talks <P> In Geneva , one team of U.S. negotiators has been bargaining with its Soviet counterpart to limit each side 's medium-range nuclear missiles . In meetings that started last month , another team aims to reduce the arsenals of intercontinental nuclear missiles . But the White House last week sent out a different , dissonant signal concerning arms control . President Reagan and his National Security Council decided against resuming negotiations , suspended for almost two years , toward a comprehensive ban on testing nuclear warheads . The Administration said that it is not opposed to the test ban , and only wants first to make compliance with earlier , partial bans more " verifiable " technically . In fact , the most plausible motive for the decision is simply that the Administration wants to keep on testing America 's nuclear warheads . <P> The verification procedures that the Administration says it wants to " strengthen " before negotiating a comprehensive ban are in two treaties . The 1974 Threshold Test-Ban Treaty ( TTBT ) outlaws all underground detonations of warheads having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground or under sea are prohibited by a previous treaty . ) The 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty ( PNE ) provides for the same explosive limits if nuclear blasting should ever be used in such enterprises as mining or canal digging . TTBT requires a U.S.-Soviet exchange of relevant data , which can then be checked against seismic sensor readings . PNE goes even further : U.S. negotiators persuaded the Soviets to allow U.S. inspectors to watch and measure any blasts . ( Of course , the Soviets in turn could observe U.S. detonations . ) <P> " At present , " says one senior White House official , " we can not effectively verify " explosions carried out under the two treaties . Yet a catch-22 is at work : the elaborate verification procedures become operative only when the Senate ratifies the treaties , which it has not done , although both countries have agreed to abide by the treaties ' other provisions . While the Soviets have apparently committed violations by exploding warheads as large as 300 kilotons , there is no evidence that the treaties ' still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The comprehensive test ban would eliminate all nuclear blasts and thus prevent test-firing of warheads for the next generation of U.S. missiles . Apparently Reagan believes those tests are essential , even if for political reasons he is unwilling to say so . As for the Soviets , the official news agency TASS commented that Reagan 's stated dissatisfaction with verification was " no more than a pretext for sabotaging the test-ban talks .
