The TV season may be limping to a premature end , courtesy of the seven-week- old writers ' strike , but fans of Hooperman and L.A. Law can hardly say they did n't get their money 's worth . Police Detective Harry Hooperman talked a couple of potential suicides down from building ledges , negotiated a clutch of hostage crises and got his on-again , off-again girlfriend ( and downstairs neighbor ) pregnant . Over at L.A. Law , a mob boss was gunned down across a restaurant table from Attorney Grace Van Owen ; Michael Kuzak , a partner in the firm of McKenzie , Brackman , watched a client get shot to death outside the courtroom after being acquitted of murder ; and Senior Partner Douglas Brackman had surprise reunions with no fewer than two long-lost halfbrothers  --  as well as his dead father 's mistress . He is now sleeping with the latter . <P> It has been , in other words , business as usual in the world of Producer Steven Bochco . And that business has been awfully good . Bochco , 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shatter TV 's familiar formulas , is on a roll . L.A. Law , his designer drama about life in the legal fast lane , is about to end its second season on NBC as the highest- rated dramatic show on TV 's highest-rated network . Hooperman , starring John Ritter as a sensitive San Francisco cop , is one of the season 's top-rated new series and an ambitious pioneer of TV 's newest form , the " dramedy . " A potential spin-off is already in the works , focusing on a dwarf private eye named Nick Derringer , to be introduced in a segment next week . In addition , Bochco has signed a development deal with ABC that calls for him to create ten more series over the next nine years . Even if only two or three of the shows make it , Bochco 's stamp will be on a sizable chunk of the prime-time schedule for much of the next decade . <P> That stamp , first seen in his groundbreaking police show Hill Street Blues , has changed the face of TV . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature a medley of interwoven plots and characters . They grapple with tough social issues , yet leap from scenes of intense drama to raucous comedy . They relentlessly push network standards of good taste , often with a schoolboy penchant for gross-out humor and sexual fetishes . " Steve has . always been one to break the rules , " says former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker . " He does it more cleverly , even diabolically , than anyone else . He rocks the boat as a hobby . " <P> Most important , Bochco has demonstrated that boat-rocking can win an audience  --  one , moreover , made up of the sort of young , upscale viewers that advertisers prize most . Bochco creates TV shows for people who do n't watch TV . No producer of the 1980s has been more influential . " He 's shown that there 's an audience for excellence , " says David Milch , a former Hill Street writer and now an executive producer of Beverly Hills Buntz . " In so doing , he has increased the possibilities for everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the collaborative medium of network TV , Bochco is known as a tough and sometimes abrasive battler for his standards . Colleagues describe him as cool and self-confident , stubborn when dealing with superiors and direct with underlings who do not deliver the goods . " I know I can be difficult , " Bochco concedes . " But you ca n't do work at this level without being demanding of yourself and others . "
