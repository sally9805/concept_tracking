Rejected job applicants will get a second chance <P> During the past six years , about 8,000 members of minority groups were turned down for jobs at Prudential Insurance , in part because they could not meet minimal standards for reading or math . Though most were high school graduates , scores of 3 or lower were common on math-competency tests , where the scale runs to 9 . Last week Prudential revealed that it was going into the business of remedial education . In a precedent-setting agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor , the company promised to spend an estimated $3 million to offer 260 classroom hours of training to the same people it had rejected for jobs . At least 600 graduates will be offered full-time employment . <P> Newark-based Prudential 's endeavor , which could have a wide-ranging impact on affirmative-action programs in many industries , followed a five-year Labor Department investigation of the company 's hiring practices .

The findings suggested that Prudential was rejecting a disproportionate number of minority applicants . <P> Prudential at first refused to release detailed employment information to the Government , claiming that to do so would violate employee confidentiality . The Labor Department retaliated by threatening to bar Prudential from further Government insurance business . The company relented after being served with a court order .

Participants will be paid the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour while learning , and some of the classes will be at night so that trainees now working elsewhere can attend . At the same time , those employment tests that gave the applicants such a hard time will be reviewed with an eye to making them more job related . <P> The settlement will also aid the company 's female employees . It calls for the firm to take a hard look at how new women agents are paid to determine if they are being discriminated against . Prudential , it seems , is moving to make life on the Rock a little more equitable for everyone .
