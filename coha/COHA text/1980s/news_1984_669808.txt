MIAMI  --  Air Florida said it agreed to give its principal lender , InterFirst Bank , 15% of its common stock and $6. 5 million cash in exchange for having the bank wipe out a $33 million debt . The Dallas-based bank consequently lifted the default notice it imposed last week on the financially troubled carrier . Donald Lloyd-Jones , Air Florida ' s chairman and chief executive officer , also indicated the company had been far closer to ceasing operations last week than it acknowledged publicly at the time . Mr. Lloyd-Jones said Air Florida is continuing its talks with an investor who is considering making a large capital injection in return for " a controlling , although not a majority , " interest in the company . As reported , the investor , whose identity hasn ' t been announced , is considering giving Air Florida $15 million to $25 million in return for at least 30% of Air Florida ' s stock . The interested investor is said to be General Electric Credit Corp. , a unit of General Electric Co . , Fairfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Florida $6 million of the $6. 5 million the carrier is paying its bank , but neither would say whether the financing concern is also the interested investor . Partly as a result of the InterFirst transaction , Mr. Lloyd-Jones said Air Florida , which has been in the red since the 1981 fourth quarter , will return to profitability in the current quarter , and will remain in the black throughout the year . Mr. Lloyd-Jones has proven over-optimistic in the past . In late 1982 , for example , he said the airline would become profitable by the beginning of last year . But for the 1983 nine months , Air Florida reported a net loss of $21. 6 million on revenue of $164. 3 million . Without the equity-for-debt swap announced yesterday , Mr. Lloyd-Jones said Air Florida would have ceased operations within days . After InterFirst , the lead bank of InterFirst Corp. , a Dallas bank holding company , declared the carrier in default last week and moved to seize its accounts receivable , he said , " We operated for five days with almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s statement last week that it had made arrangements to ensure that it would be able " to continue normal operations . " Mr. Lloyd-Jones said also he had been told by InterFirst that the equity-for-debt transaction " wouldn ' t have any effect on their profit-loss statement . " He said he assumed the bank wrote off its loans to Air Florida in its third quarter , when it reported a net loss of $194 million , the largest quarterly deficit in U.S. banking history . Mr. Lloyd-Jones said the actual number of shares to be issued to InterFirst hasn ' t been determined . The pact calls for the bank to hold 15% of the carrier ' s common , he said , but the number of shares issued will depend on the amount issued to the interested investor . Air Florida currently has about 17. 3 million shares outstanding , a spokeswoman said . Air Florida ' s shares were quoted at $2. 6875 bid , in over-the-counter trading . Mr. Lloyd-Jones said he didn ' t expect InterFirst to lend money again to Air Florida . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a bank once the investment has been made , " he said . He said he is certain that the capital injection being discussed will occur . The $6 million that General Electric Credit is lending the carrier is secured by a lien on four of Air Florida ' s Boeing Co. 737200s . Mr. Lloyd-Jones said the company expects to sell the aircraft within two weeks to GPA Group Ltd. , the U.S. unit of Guinness Peat Aviation Group Ltd. , a Shannon , Ireland , aircraft brokerage concern , for between $40 million and $50 million . Completion of the sale will allow Air Florida to repay General Electric Credit , the carrier said . Liens on the aircraft have been held by the Federal Aviation Administration , which Air Florida currently owes about $80 million , Mr. Lloyd-Jones said . He said the agency gave up the liens in exchange for the right in the event of default to foreclose on Air Florida ' s accounts receivable . The FAA became a creditor because it guaranteed Air Florida ' s purchases of certain aircraft and paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the proceeds of the expected sale of the Boeing 737s will be used to reduce the carrier ' s debt to the FAA by about half , Mr. Lloyd-Jones said.  --  - In Dallas , Robert H. Stewart , InterFirst Bank ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said that as a result of the receipt of the $6. 5 million , there wouldn ' t be any additional charge-offs on the bank ' s books in connection with Air Florida ' s loans . " The bank hasn ' t assigned on its books any value to the common stock of Air Florida it is to receive upon completion of the settlement , " he said , adding , " Therefore , there will be no negative impact upon the future earnings of the bank resulting from these arrangements .
