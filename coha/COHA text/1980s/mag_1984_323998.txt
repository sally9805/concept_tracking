The Meese investigation leaves a vacuum at the department <P> Can the Justice Department function effectively without a full-fledged Attorney General ? Americans may soon find out . William French Smith insists that he plans to leave the post to return to his California law practice this month , and President Reagan has not pressed him to reconsider . Edwin Meese , Reagan 's nominee as Smith 's replacement , can not be confirmed until a special prosecutor finishes investigating Meese 's sloppy financial dealings , a process likely to take at least six months . Nor is there officially a Deputy Attorney General to fill in during the interim ; Edward Schmults , who had been handling the daily operations of the Justice Department , quit that post last February and has not been replaced . <P> The White House last week toyed with the idea of finding a temporary fillin , then discovered that it could not bypass the department 's internal succession rules but must go through confirmation hearings for a permanent replacement . So unless Meese decides to step aside or Smith agrees not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 election year will be , by default , the department 's third-ranking official , Associate Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen . <P> White House advisers have no personal objection to Jensen , 55 , a former district attorney of Alameda County , Calif , who had earlier ( 1958-66 ) been an assistant D.A . there when Meese was a deputy in the same office . Jensen helped organize the mass arrests of Berkeley students during the Free Speech Movement of the mid- ' 60s and prosecuted radicals such as Huey Newton and the kidnapers of Patty Hearst . Jensen does not need Senate confirmation , but his tenuous status could be an election-year liability , reminding voters of the disarray at the department and the ethical quandaries that have plagued Reagan 's Administration . Lamented a top White House adviser : " We are just going to have to live with it . " <P> At Meese 's request , Smith last week asked a select panel of three senior federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor with a wide latitude to look into charges that Meese was helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report one loan and a stock purchase , got special treatment in shifting his Army Reserve status and knew more than he has admitted about documents from the 1980 Carter campaign that ended up in his own files . The prosecutor is expected to be named this week . Even if the investigation is completed within six months and Meese is cleared , White House aides think it unlikely he could be confirmed before the elections , if at all .
