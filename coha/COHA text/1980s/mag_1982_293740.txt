THE COLLECTED STORIES by Isaac Bashevis Singer Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 610 pages ; $19.95 <P> A hallmark of literary modernism is the notion that readers must earn their places at the feet of the masters .

" The narrator of The Cafeteria meets a woman who claims to have seen Adolf Hitler on upper Broadway . Her confidant is ultimately inclined to believe her : " Esther did n't sound insane . She had seen a piece of reality that the heavenly censorship prohibits as a rule . She had caught a glimpse behind the curtain of phenomena . "
