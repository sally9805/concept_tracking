Nearly as big as the U.S. , this plateau is literally out of the world-on Venus . Though the perpetual cloud cover of the earth 's nearest planetary neighbor has kept its surface tantalizingly hidden , Venus ' veil is being lifted by a gifted robot . The Pioneer-Venus Or biter spacecraft has been circling the planet since December 1978 , analyzing its atmosphere and scanning and rescanning its surface with radar .
