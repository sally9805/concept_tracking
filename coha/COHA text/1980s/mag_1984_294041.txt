After a generation of independence , Africa faces harsh facts and hard choices <P> Our ancient continent is now on the brink of disaster , hurtling towards the abyss of confrontation , caught in the grip of violence . Gone are the smiles , the joys of life . <P> <P> - Edem Kodjo , former <P> Secretary-General of the Organization for <P> African Unity <P> A quarter of a century after the nations of sub-Saharan Africa began to gain their independence , that bleak view is shared by increasing numbers of Africans and non-Africans alike . The New Year 's Eve coup in Nigeria was only the most recent recurrence of a pattern of failure that has gripped the continent . Black-ruled Africa is suffering today from a political and economic malaise that few could have imagined when British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan spoke eloquently in 1960 of the " wind of change " then sweeping the continent . <P> Uhuru ! , the Swahili clarion call for freedom from the European colonial powers , has brought independence but little liberty for millions of black Africans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been transformed into reality , but it has suffered an ironic distortion . Many Africans now have one vote , but often it can be cast for only one man . Zambia 's President Kenneth Kaunda was the sole candidate in his nation 's presidential elections last October , when he was elected to a fifth four-year term . In Kenya , long a showplace of African democracy , President Daniel Arap Moi faced no challenger in elections last September . <P> All too frequently , fledgling African democracies have become hostage to leaders intent solely on gaining and holding power . In the past 25 years , more than 70 leaders in 29 African nations have been deposed by assassination , purges or coups . Among the 41 major independent black African nations , only seven allow opposition political parties . Seventeen are single-party states . Another 17 are ruled by military regimes . <P> Economically , the picture is no brighter . In nation after nation , independence has been followed by a steady decrease in per capita food production .

In the meantime , sub-Saharan Africa 's population of 210 million in 1960 has grown to 393 million . It continues to increase by 2.9% annually , the fastest growth rate in the world . <P> Almost without exception , African governments have allowed a crucial part of their colonial inheritance-the infrastructure of roads , railways , cities and towns built by Europeans-to deteriorate . In Dar es Salaam , the once attractive capital of Tanzania , years of post-colonial neglect have left their ravages . Pavements are cracked and unrepaired . Manhole covers have disappeared and not been replaced . Buildings are unpainted and grimy . In many areas , garbage is no longer collected ; thin wisps of pungent smoke curl up through the palm trees from burning piles of refuse . <P> Roads built by European engineers are being gradually swallowed up by the bush .
