DASHIELL HAMMETT : A LIFE <P> by Diane Johnson <P> Random House ; 344 pages ; $17.95 <P> He was a Pinkerton operative in his 20s . In 1921 he shadowed Comedian Fatty Arbuckle , implicated in the death of a starlet , and noted : " His eyes were the eyes of a man who expected to be regarded as a monster ... I made my gaze as contemptuous as I could . " It could have been the stuff of hard-boiled detective literature ; instead it was the stuff of hard-boiled detective life : the life lived by Dashiell Hammett , creator of The Thin Man and The Maltese Falcon . A voracious reader of Henry James , before he switched to the school of hard knocks , Hammett wrote four novels in a single burst of creativity from 1927 to 1930 . He found himself hailed by Andr Gide and Andr Malraux , and invited to work in Hollywood . <P> There he discovered familiar diversions , among them prostitutes and Scotch . His great affair with Lillian Hellman did not spur him to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novelist Diane Johnson ( Lying Low ) , did it change his habits . Despite his proclaimed affection for Hellman , he continued to patronize ladies of the evening and once asked her to join in a threesome ( she declined ) . Hammett admired Marxism more than the U.S. Communist Party but joined a celebrity cell where he indulged in what Budd Schulberg called " dialectical materialism by the pool . " In 1951 , long after most film radicals had fled the cause , he spent six months in prison for refusing to divulge names in a Communist-hunting case . <P> The tight-lipped code of honor was another manifestation of the literary silence , posing as bravery , that lasted until his death of lung cancer in 1961 . The act convinced no one , least of all his biographer . Johnson regards her subject without illusion . She knows that inspiration can arrive and vanish without cause and that Hammett 's chief tragedy was in holding himself accountable for something beyond his gifts or character . Even so , as she sees it , he showed a streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " the long blank years that prove the spirit . " That kind of exit line is equal to the worst of Hammett 's life-and the best of his work . <P> <P> DEADLY FORCE <P> by Lawrence O'Donnell Jr . <P> Morrow ; 384 pages ; $16.95 <P> On a January afternoon in 1975 , while James Bowden was at his job cleaning floors at Boston City Hospital , a store in nearby Cambridge was robbed . Hours later , two Boston policemen spotted Bowden 's parked car , which looked like the robbers ' and had a similar license-plate number . The police waited , and when they saw Bowden get into the car , leaped out and shot him dead-within " three to five seconds , " according to a reporter who was with the police . But the car was not the getaway car . Bowden had no criminal record . And at 5 ft. 4 in. and 180 Ibs. , he fitted the description of the tall , lean robbers in only one way : he was black . Despite the reluctance of citizens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a criminal , an all-white jury found the killing to be a " wrongful death , " and awarded his widow Patricia a judgment , still unpaid , that with interest exceeds $750,000.
