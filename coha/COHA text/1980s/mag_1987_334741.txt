I discovered one of the more pleasant aspects of my job last week when I met with a select group of young men and women on the 48th floor of our New York City headquarters for the second annual presentation of TIME 's College Achievement Awards . They were 18 of the 20 winners of $2,500 scholarships and more than half of the 80 finalists , who each received $250 , in an intense competition to select this year 's outstanding U.S. college juniors . After joining me in congratulating them , TIME Managing Editor Jason McManus warned them of the challenges ahead . " Competent or not , ready or not , you will end up in charge , " he said . " It is you , in your time , and those like you of your generation , who will make America work . Or falter . " <P> Judging from the quality of last year 's awardees , five of whom were among the nation 's 32 Rhodes scholars named in 1986 , this year 's contingent promises much in terms of that crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer scanner , a part-time Washington lobbyist against federal deficits and a professional ballerina turned budget analyst . Diversity is the rule . Eric Gaidos plots schemes for the exploration of Mars at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology . Martha McSally , a biology major and triathlete , helps oversee basic training at the U.S. Air Force Academy . And there is William Anton , who , when not earning straight A 's at Princeton 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs , is in the ring training for a shot at the U.S. Olympic boxing team . <P> Despite their varied interests , the winners seem to have one quality in common : a social conscience . That trait is perhaps best summed up by Louisa Smith , a student of public policy at Harvard-Radcliffe College . Before leaving for Washington with her fellow achievers to meet Vice President George Bush , who had expressed interest in chatting with this year 's winners , Smith talked about her commitment to the inmates of the prisons and mental hospitals she has been visiting since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems I have seen , " said Smith , " but I can not walk away from them .
