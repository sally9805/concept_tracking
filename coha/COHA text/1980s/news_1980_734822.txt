txt MONTGOMERY , Ala . ? The leaders of 15 black-oriented organizations will meet with President-elect Ronald Reagan Thursday in Washington , D.C. My concern is not what they will tell Reagan , but what they will do for black people over the next 12 months . The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery , president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , alluded to the forthcoming meeting here in the final session last Friday of a week-long observance of the 25th anniversary of the Montgomery bus boycott . I liked just about everything the Rev. Dr. Lowery said in his moving , incisive The Methodist minister urged blacks not to believe that Reagan had been given a mandate to turn back the civil rights clock . interpretation of the state of the nation In regard to race relations . He said that black people should n't " care who the President is , if we get ourselves together . " The Rev. Dr. Lowery , of Atlanta , was a close associate of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . and was a founder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged black people to steer clear of the strategy ? or rather the non-strategy ? of " hopscotching around according to who is running the big store . " Instead , he urged that black Americans " come back home " to the principles of collective action and unified concern symbolized by the Montgomery bus boycott launched on Dec. 5 , 1955 . THE REV . DR . Lowery Is one of this to his predominantly black audience here at Old Ship African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church about the election of Reagan and all the dire predictions of things to come after he is sworn in . ' " What happened ( during the presidential campaign ) is that the forces of the right-wing were organized and better mobilized than the forces of progress , " he declared . " While you and I were off on our paths of invidious individualism , while you and I were off on our excursions of accepting something less than the best , of what ' 1 can get for myself , ' the so-called Moral Majority and the tar-right-wing political and religious groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that lengthy paragraph and they responded with " Have mercy , Lord , " " Amen , brother , - and " Tell the truth . " They also interpreted that statement to apply principally to black leaders and other professionals who have profited most since Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a city bus here 25 years ago . THE REV . DR . Lowery is one of this country 's , most effective pulpit speakers . He is a master at expressing profound thoughts with an emotional appeal that black audiences appreciate . " Do n't let other folks analyze this election ? for you , " he declared . " Analyze it for yourself . " There were a few " Amens " but the focus was on his next words . The Methodist minister urged blacks not to believe that Reagan had been given a mandate to turn back the civil rights clock . In fact , the Rev. Dr. Lowery contended that Reagan had not been given anything close to a mandate by a popular vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 51 per cent of the popular vote . Only six other Presidents were ever elected with a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Reagan had , the Rev. Dr. Lowery continued . " The truth is that in 19 states , where Reagan won the electoral vote , he did not receive the majority of the popular vote ? only a plurality , " he declared . The Rev. Dr. Lowery suggested that the progressive forces in this country , particularly blacks , recognize that the conservatives in the last election " beat us at our own game . " THE NEW conservative slogan " power to the people " started in the black ghettos during the 19fi0s , he declared . " They are singing the right song but to the wrong tulle , " the Rev. Dr. Lowery declared . The conservatives ' demand for a return of power to the people is being sung to the tune of " Look Away , Look Away , Look Away , Dixieland , " he added . There was an outburst of laughter throughout the church . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " come back home " and mobilize as they once did . Many who stood and cheered last Friday bight remembered . Unfortunately , too many millions of their brothers and sisters have forgotten .
