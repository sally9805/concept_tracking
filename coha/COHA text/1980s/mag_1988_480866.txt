The late great journalist Al . Liebling , who imagined the city of New Orleans with the intensity of a true lover , once described it as a combination of Paterson , New Jersey , and Port-au-Prince . Liebling was conjuring up the city before 1960 , in most of which Stanley Kowalski would still have been comfortable without a shirr . The high life and the low life were curiously turned and very restricted . It was a poor , peculiar , happy place , where the fateful gaiety of carnival really did last all year long ? an antic spirit that savored very much of mortality and the imperfectness of things . Only local black people and a handful of hipsters knew to call it the Big Easy . With the oil boom , New Orleans acquired a belt of Chiclet suburbs where alligators fled the new white middle class that fled the inner city , divided , ironically , by integration . Million-dollar condominiums were nailed together everywhere in the Vieux Cane . Until 1960 a French Quarter address still carried with it more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only big hotel actually in the Quarter .

He is at work on new novel . simulated essence of magnolia , with menu prose that implied they had been stand-ing at least since Kate Chopin 's day . One of them , the Bourbon Orleans , occupied the shell of the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Family , The Sisters were small brown Creole ladies of an ineffable delicacy , and I have often wondered whither they were removed . The convent , as I remember , had fewer stories than the hotel has , although the hotel is no higher . Above Canal Street , the city acquired several brutal square skyscrapers of the sort that seem to require a rooftop sign reading BULLSHIT WALKSthey manage to be tall and squat at the same time .

I seem to remember chimes that sounded " Abide With Me " over the rattle of the St. Charles streetcar and the newsie 's cry and the police whistles . I 'll never be sure how much of what I remember is imagined , so readily does this city lend itself to dreams . Memory is subverted , tainted by fantasies that thrive in the languid shadows . People who grew up here tell me it is the same for them , that the way in which they recall lining up for frozen Sno Balls or going to parochial school takes on a certain spin . At the same time , reality has always been relentless in New Orleans . My daughter was born in Huey Long 's Charity Hospital under legal segregation , which meant that everything was done twice , separately , often cheerfully and in theoretical equality but under circumstances that are horrible to contemplate today . There was nothing insubstantial about the poverty , violence , and general squalor that poor people , white or black , endured in the land of dreams . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . In the waiting room outside the maternity ward , I fell into conversation with a Cajun farmer who assured me that St. Joseph took special care of firstborn children . It was good to hear a friendly word in that hard-boiled but unsanitary place . Politics had a way of coming to you in Louisiana , circa 1960 , even of coming at you , no matter how you tried to hide . For one thing , the desegregation battles were being fought in the streets and in the small towns of the Deep South . About the time I showed up , other young people from the North were appearing all over the South to help in the struggle for black civil rights , I was not among them ; instead I was ingloriously supporting my new career as a beatnik , selling encyclopedias door-to-door in towns such as Bogalusa and Picayune . By some perverse synchronicity I always seemed to appear with my cheap suit and dissembling sales pitch at the very moment when the townsfolk had sworn unspeakable violence against the next fast-talking scut of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern accents were instantly detected and explanations urgently required . In several places I was rescued by the police ; in others , I was not . I got to see the inside of a couple of Mississippi and northeast Louisiana jails . To this day , when people from the movement tell war stories and talk Southern prisons , I 'm tempted to casually put in my observations on the St. Tammany Parish lockup compared with the jail in Pearl River County . But at the time I was a subscriber to art for art 's sake , wanting to be left alone . The last thing Louisiana needed in 1960 was a few more beatniks , but there we were . It was existential . We got by with odd jobs and passing the goblet after poetry readings . There was a bar on Burgundy Street that featured hunches of bananas as part of its decor ; on evenings when the paying customers found our performance insufficiently stirring , they would toss bananas at us to indicate their displeasure . A poet I know would take the bananas home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days , the vie de bottrne was undertaken without state assistance . The only thing forthcoming from the municipal welfare authorities , should we have been rash enough to approach them in our penury , would have been a couple of expletives and the advice to get out of town . We went from day to day , eating when we worked , fasting otherwise . Our poverty was not a game ; there were no rich relatives back home to bail us out . On the other hand we always felt just on the edge of vision , an available cop-out , shameful but perhaps eventually necessary . One could always go home , get a steady job , maybe save enough to go to college . Our style , if not our lack of means , was voluntary . But around us in those years another kind of poverty ruled , one that afforded its subjects no redeeming posture . The timeless poverty of the Deep South had not been relieved at that time , if indeed it has since . For all that things had improved since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark enchantment over that part of the country , laving the edges of the city and flourishing well inside it . Its victims were more often black than white ( although plenty were white ) . This poverty was deathly mean and formidable ; it embittered people and made them dangerous ; it stunted hope and destroyed even the imagination . Because I was young and male , the aspect of the poor South that most arrested my attention then was its anger and violence . I was looking for experience , wanting to learn . I got it and I learned . Eventually , I saw that poverty and the culture it promotes have a political dimension . Politics , it turned out , was not something I could ignore . Of course it would have been hard to ignore politics in New Orleans in any case , if in a definition of politics one chooses to include the caperings and adventures of Louisiana politicians . When I first came to the city , Huey Long 's younger brother Earl was at the end of his long career , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over town . When I came to write my first novel , which like all first novelists I made the receptacle of every single thing 1 knew , I found Louisiana and its politics inevitable . I thought A Hall of Mirrors was quite fair to America in important ways , although probably unfair to New Orleans in unimportant ones . I tried never to let on how in love I was with the big soupy city , but it came through anyway . The idea of the Republicans convening in the Superdome aroused in my breast a fierce possessiveness to which I was not in the least entitled . The town the Republicans came to was a 58 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / NOVEMBER recall . Preservation has always been a little difficult in New Orleans , where politicians have traditionally been available for a good time . The old breed of shady white politician had been replaced by a new breed of shady black politician , but money was still green . Subsequently , however , oil rook its downturn and the city went back to living off the out-of-towners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vieux Carre , the old walls looked patched and peeled now , and balconies were sagging . The Times-Picayune ran a story on the " demolition by neglect " of some of the older buildings . The owners of these buildings , the story said , " either did n't want to spend the money or hoped to let an old building decay so badly that the city would finally allow the owner to tear it down and put the property to more profitable use , such as turning it into a hotel or a parking lot . " My personal standard of measure is the building my wife and I lived in on St. Philip ; ten years ago it had been newly renovated , but this August it looked worse than it did when we moved in . Some New Orleans residents I talked to say that the hard times have at least served to maintain the Quarter 's character ? which depends somewhat on its characters , many of whom may be priced out when the boom comes back . But in the quiet streets away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung timeless and fragrant and it might have been long ago . You could hear children playing on some of the patios , and caged canaries sang in the balcony windows . All over town the ironwork was dressed in patriotic bunting as the city got itself up for the convention , the old soul sister never more herself than when getting ready for a party . Even good-time girls have their authenticity . The Louisiana Superdome , the actual site of the four-day convention , is a wonder of the modern age . If the purpose of the vaulted Gothic cathedrals was to remind humanity that God was above , the Superdome serves to remind us that what yawns eternally overhead today is space . Together with the Hyatt Regency and an adjoining shopping mall , to which it is attached by a concrete caul , the Superdome forms an air-conditioned island of spic-and-span order right in the middle of funk 's own hometown . Within this bastion you can watch the NFL Saints , go to bed , or sip an aperitif at a sidewalk caf ? the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire complex was as busy as a hive , with delegates , guests , and journalists lining up for food and drink . In the shopping mall , the outer reaches of the Hyatt , and all around the Superdome itself , hucksters were selling Ollie North videotapes , Ronald Reagan masks , political chachkas of every kind . It would not betoo much to say that a carnival atmosphere prevailed . Strolling this enormous carnival , I saw ghosts . 1 took the 1960 census here . Yes , right here , house-to-house in the summer heat , I carried my census hook , knocking on doors when there were doors to knock on , yoo-hooing into shanties , poking my nose into people 's kitchens . The people endured my questions : Place of birth ? Estimated yearly income ? Mother 's full name ? Father 's ? Condition of residence ? We did n't ask that one ; the answer was always " dilapidated , " and we checked the appropriate square . Where the counter dispensing Libertarian Republican literature stood was once a row of shacks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of the campaign-button boutique was a storefront church , the Sanctified Temple of the Lord God , in whose window was the painted text : " Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . " ( When I first saw that text in the church window I did n't understand what it meant , though I 've since learned . ) Under the dome itself , where the hand played " Happy Days Are Here Again , " was a kind of hotel , unlike the Hyatt Regency , in which solitary people lived in rooms divided at the top by chicken wire , and with candles for light . Where the podium was erected ? of course I exaggerate here , but not by much , a block or two ? was the house in which I apprehended one of the very few political truths I know . Let me describe the scene . It is July 1960 and I am alone , deep in the heart of the black slum where many years later the Superdome will rise . I am not , as I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact . I 've been coming back here for weeks and everybody knows my white face by now . Some people are rather short with me , but many others sit me down with a cool drink and tell me the story of their lives . Never have I known heat like this . Never have I seen such poverty . I am Tail-end Charlie for the census , I get the hard cases ? the brothels , skid row , the B-girl dorms , the transvestites who scared the last census taker away . It 's an aspiring young novelist 's dream . I 'm also assigned to the poorest black areas back-of-town to get people the regulars missed . The fact is , I 'm having rather a good time of it . I have taken to the South in a big way . I feel very romantically about it . I 've also fallen hard for black-ness , in the mindless old-time hipper-than-thou beatnik way . In the weeks I 've been in this back-of-town , I 've been listening to black speech and watching black moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young literary bells . It 's got something all right , the rhythms and the raps are sounding in my dreams ; I think I 'm ready to signify . Late one afternoon , up against the Illinois Central yards , I check out a ramshackle wooden house suspected of being a household . No one , over the summer , has responded to the bureau 's attempts at communication . So I knock . .. and this time there 's an answer , a female voice asks me in . Inside , half a dozen people are gathered around a bed . Beside it , a single candle burns at the feet of a plaster Virgin . Cloth blinds have been drawn over the windows to keep back the killing sun , and the candle provides the only light in the room . I advance on the bed . The people in the room have turned to watch me . Looking over their shoulders , I see that lying there , with clean white sheets drawn almost up to her chin , is a very old woman . Her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles . Her toothless face is like an old turtle 's . She breathes slowly and with difficulty . She 's clearly dying . I am delighted to learn that the folks in the room are attendant relatives from two different households , an overwhelming tactical coup , census-wise . In my brisk impatience to record the statistical details of everyone 's life , it takes me a moment to register the fact that these people are strangely unforthcoming . Looking up from my forms , I confront their eyes , Their eyes are calmly questioning , almost humorous . I stand and stare and return to my jottings , and then suddenly it hits me : someone is dying here . These people have come to attend a death . Perhaps this is not the best of times for census taking ? . After this death-defying leap of understanding , the rest follows unbidden . That had this been a white middle-class household I would never have been allowed past the door . That had this been a white middle-class household I would never have dreamed of entering a sickroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had come to mourn and pray . That what has happened here is entirely determined by the politics of race and class ? how blinding it can he , how dehumanizing , how denying of basic human dignity . So I left , and walking along Dryades Street in the paralyzing glare , the rest of the wave hit me . The question of why I , a white person from out of town , should have been taking the census here . That there were no black census takers . So the voice of God was in that wave . A poor thing , a less than dazzling exercise of the social sensibilities , but mine nevertheless . In the many ' years since then , I have tried to keep that frail candle of insight flickering . Through the absurdity and bloody-mindedness of Race Relations in America , a subject so double-dipped in hype , phoniness , hustling , hypocrisy , lies , stu pidity , malice , blind ambition , ignorance , groveling , sniveling , and foolishness that it defies coherence , I 've tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow us a moment of common sense . Watching the Republicans convene among the ghosts , I tried to hold it to my heart . he hotel in which I stayed was beside a freeway and of a singular crumminess . Unluckily for the management , the New York delegation was housed there , and in no time at all , a media blitz of ridicule descended on the unfortunate place . A block the other side of Canal stood the Iberville Housing Project , another place I remembered from long ago . In my memory , the Iberville project had both black and white tenants , the officially segregated housing blocks alternating racially , so that passersby could see poor Southern kids , black and white , playing together . Now the project was officially integrated ? and all black . Unemployment in the project ran up to 70 percent . Late one night , in a welter of blue lights visible from the hotel bar , the police picked up the body of an unidentified black male in his twenties . He had been shot through the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me that I might have counted him back in 1960 ; he might have been one of the babies . There were so many . At the Calliope Street houses , a project that stands in what 's left of the slum the Superdome replaced , residents had their usual route to Canal Street blocked by chain-link fences installed around the Dome for security purposes . Forced to walk the long way round , they were able to see the limousines scooting past , creating a significant juxtaposition no self-respecting reporter could resist . To Calliope Street went the working press , eliciting forlorn quotes . These are from the Times-Picayune ; " Ask the politicians if they can cut out the shooting out here , " said Mayola Brumfield , 40 , cradling her granddaughter on a porch step . " Tell them I need a job ? bad , " said Brenda Sumling , 26 . To all of which the unwritten coda was Good luck . A few hundred yards and a world away from Calliope Street , the President was now speaking . I missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk from the hotel to the Superdome and cover some of the old ground . This foolish exercise in nostalgia soon found me wandering through Fritz Lang 's worst movie , a godforsaken wilderness of cement over which whirled a vortex of ascending and descending freeway ramps . Ghostly figures darted at the edge of the open spaces . I hurried , sweating mightily in the heat , feeling whiter than Moby-Dick and equally pursued . Imagine my relief , then , when I gained admission to the great stadium and heard the dear , familiar voice . It is not entirely facetious to speak of the President 's voice as dear and familiar . Ronald Reagan is one of the most interesting phenomena this country affords , and no examination of contemporary American reality should be undertaken without reference to him . In the Superdome on August 15 , he was giving the assembled delegates and their guests enormous pleasure , making them laugh , bringing them to their feet with fierce patriotic cries , and occasionally reducing them to tears . " Twilight ? Not in America . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreams to build . " One had the feeling he might have gone on and on and on . What could be dearer or more familiar , a happy mating of Ursprache and muzak , the refined essence of every sunlit daydream crooned in a reassuring , cheery baritone . Where have we heard it before ? But where have we not heard it ? It 's the primal voice of the electronic age , the medium and the message , the voice that never sleeps , that cajoles , inspires , and commands wherever cathodes glow . We can no more resist it than oncoming night . For just about as long as Ronald Reagan has been alive , this voice has whispered in our dreams , a manifestation of American reality . Flick a switch and there it is , unresponding but constant , everywhere , every hour . It seems to emanate from some invisible consensus , the voice we have all agreed to hear . It is not the voice of a man ; its name is legion . It is inside us . Our consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the moon . Hearing it , we mistake it for our own . Dutch Reagan , the man on the radio , is speaking in the voice of American popular culture . No one does it better . One of American popular culture 's principal artifacts is a sentimentalized view of America , touched by the dreams of the immigrants , rubes , and carnies who created it . Its media are semaphores , not much good for conveying subtleties . In the language of American popular culture , words cast no shadows . The land to which it speaks is a land without irony , a land without contradictions , a land in fact that does n't exist and never did . All the same , it 's the real thing , the McCoy . That 's a paradox , the only paradox you have to know in Ronald Reagan 's business . He was a poor kid , his old man drank . God knows what he 's really like . But now he 's American popular culture 's greatest creation since the Wizard of Oz , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , as a voice or an image on a screen , he 's always been the agent of someone else 's agenda . Part of America 's willingness to forgive him for the disasters of his administration may relate to the sense he gives of having been dragged in arsy-varsy , a secondary figure in his own career , along for the ride . His most effective public gesture is that humorous shrug of incomprehension , a mannerism that appears strangely genuine . To see him do it is to laugh with him , to share his amused befuddlement at the mess the world 's in . It 's also reassuring . If things are this bad and he 's not worried , why should we be ? Inside the Superdome on that Monday night , he was breaking their hearts for a while . And why not ? He had perfected his routine before a lot of them were born . Then a balloon popped . For a fraction of a second his rhythm broke , he seemed to lose forward motion . He misspoke a word or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the man himself was too far away , a tiny figure . It 's difficult not to speculate on his inner life . Everybody has one . What resides at the core ? What does he mean , " It 's morning again in America " ! Why should it be morning ? Suddenly , he regains his timing and I have the answer to that . I have only to look at him on the monitor and 1 know . It 's because morning is time for brunch . Brunch is what he 's making me think of . Maybe everyone in the audience all across America is listening and thinking of something equally scrumptious . I see it shining plain : it 's 11:00 A.M. and we 're in Pacific Palisades and the sun is sparkling on Santa Monica Bay . There will be croissants and honeydew . It 's brunch , the California Eucharist , the sustaining reality at the President 's core . It makes me feel like cheering , but when the monitors fade , he 's gone . jority . Falwell was dapper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bakkers and Jimmy Swaggart had " hurt the cause of Christ . " He said he found the fall of the Bakkers unremarkable ; he had been detecting a materialist element in their theology for a long time . In response to a question , he hinted , as he has several times lately , that he was about to undertake a program of civil disobedience . He compared Roe v. Wade with the Dred Scott decision . He sounded less like the leader of any " majority " than like the organizer of a major pressure group setting out to make trouble for the misguided . Generally the convention was short on conflict . One of its minor dramas was the public fall of Falwell 's fellow preacher , Pat Robertson . Robertson 's camp had harbored the only organized disgruntlement left alive by convention time . Over the course of the year his delegates in states such as Michigan and Georgia managed to threaten the seamless fabric of Republican good fellowship . But in the end , Robertson simply failed to gather the money or the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention found him in the position of a man who had thrown a roundhouse right at the bouncer and connected with the incorporeal air . A muted anti-clericalism prevailed among the party pros . On Tuesday night , Robertson took his wages in the form of an opportunity to address the convention . He was less than electrifying . As his speech progressed , it was possible to stand at the exits and watch the crowds streaming out into the night , hound for Antoine 's and Mahogany Hall . His press conference the next morning at the Intercontinental Hotel had a somber penitential tone . Barely a dozen reporters were present . These were equally divided between the Old Sweats , who had followed Robertson through the primaries , and the Marginals , who included this writer and an amiably nerdish young man in a baseball hat inscribed with the words ATHEIST AND PROUD . The young man described himself as " Chicago bureau chief " for the American Atheist Press . A beefy front-page type from USA Today asked him if there are also Rome and Jerusalem bureau chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau chief , who recounted for them the variety of insults , threats , and put-downs visited upon him over the previous two days by godly Republicans . Presently Robertson arrived , smiling his smile and looking philosophical . He and the atheist were old pals ; indeed , Robertson looked grateful for the company . Most of the reporters wanted to know about Robertson 's plans for the future ; they were assured that he would carry on . It was hard to believe , though . As Robertson left the room , the Chicago bureau chief of 62 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE ! NOVEMBER the American Atheist Press was pursuing his press secretary , Barbara Gattullo . " Barbara , can Pat he on my radio show ? " Iowa was long gone . It was deepest Palookaville . On the very same morning that Pat Robertson was facing the music , a state judge on the other side of the Mississippi was writing a footnote to another American religious career . Debra Arleen Murphree , the temptress before whose allure the redoubtable Jimmy Swaggart 's Christian resolve did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months , having copped a misdemeanor for prostitution . This timely retribution at the height of the convention may have preserved the career of some anonymous Republican state committeeman , who , atremble with self-destructive lust , might have flung himself on her scented settee down there on the Airline Highway . As the convention opened , the Republia running mate . Bush himself had said that he would not announce a choice until Thursday , whereupon , it was thought , the selection might be dramatized at the anointing ceremony that evening . But as early as Sunday , rumors began to fly , and their flap and flutter was distracting . It was also believed that the notables on Bush 's shortlist were not happy about having to spend the week standing around in their bathing suits . Robert Dole , who seemed to move through the convention in a storm of smiling , saturnine rage , made his displeasure public . Finally the rumors began to hint that Bush had not made up his own mind , a notion which invited mental images of the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plucking daisy petals . So on Tuesday , when the mighty paddle wheeler Natchez brought Bush down from Belle Chasse Naval Station to Spanish Plaza , Bush introduced Dan Quayle to the welcoming crowd and the word spread around town . Not all delegates , to say the least , were pleased with Bush 's decision . Some of Jack Kemp 's supporters , who were young , energetic , and numerous , cried real tears . But the blow fell hardest on the remnants of what used to be called the Eastern Republican Establishment , now reduced to a grim band of conversos practicing their ancient faith in secret . For at least the last four years , they had been sporting kelly green slacks and white loafers , trying to pass as right-to-lifing Holy Rollers , while stealthily sipping scotch and dreaming that Nelson Rockefeller is alive in the heart of a mountain somewhere . Throughout the convention they had been buttonholing media acquaintances with assurances about George Bush 's personal excellence . At any moment , they held , Bush would come into his own and reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What they got was Quayle . On Wednesday , while Pat Robertson was sparring with the Chicago bureau chief of the American Atheist Press , the conventional press was slapping Quayle around the grand ballroom of the Marriott . He was then hustled over to the Sheraton for a friendly session with the California Republican Caucus . Outside , party flacks were pointing out Quayle 's valor in choosing to help defend Indianapolis from the San Francisco Mime Troupe . Inside all was groovy . Jack Kemp , a native Californian , signed on enthusiastically , prompting a few more tears from the young surfers . Senator Pete Wilson spoke . Quayle declared his ferocious impatience to campaign against Dukakis and Bentsen . The press joke about the selection of Quayle was that " George Bush wanted a George Bush , " but that was n't it . Quayle had none of Bush 's Washington experience . According to Ger54 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE /NOVEMBER Photograph by Costa Maws / Magnum mond and Witcover 's piece in the National Journal 's Convention Daily , Quayle 's name did not appear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kentucky . Many people at the convention attributed the choice of Quayle to Roger Ailes , George Bush 's media consultant , who happens also to be a consultant for Quayle . A dream deal in the Hollywood mode , a media fix so pure it could almost be called non-political . The following day , Thursday , the Republican Mainstream Committee met at the Howard Johnson Downtown . The Mainstream Republicans were many , but the room in which they met was very small indeed . The chairman of the meeting was Congressman Jim Leach from the First District of Iowa . The press attendance was meager , featuring those birds of ill omen , Harper 's Magazine and the American Atheist Press . Many present at the Mainstream meeting were young , and they seemed idealistic in an old-fashioned , innocent way . Discussion tended to be rather abstract ; there was talk of a struggle for the soul of the party , and of the necessity for a Republican party with some social responsibility , There were general expressions of support for the ticket and attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common ground expressed was an opposition to taxes . The Libertarian tendency seemed to predominate . One of the Republicans at the meeting was Harriet Stinson of the California Republicans for Choice . The CRC had prepared a flyer it intended to distribute arguing a pro-choice position on the abortion issue . The flyers bore a few signatures that had once meant something in the Republican party ? Barry Goldwater , Charles H. Percy , S. I. Hayakawa , and Rebecca Q. Morgan of the California State Senate . Harriet Stinson had Federal Expressed her flyers to a convention hotel , where the entire consignment disappeared . Asked if she believed that the consignment had been hijacked by an anti-abortionist faction , she replied that , indeed , she suspected that was the case . Celeste King of the California Black Republican Council pointed out that when Vice President Bush landed at Spanish Plaza the only black on the platform was a high school kid playing the trumpet . King called the situation unacceptable . So the Mainstream Republicans got nothing from George Bush 's post-Reaganite Republican party . Black Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King in Bush 's gallery , where she and the candidate acknowledged the applause of the convention . The Wall Street conversos got to hear the languid upscale tones of Governor Tom Kean'skeynote address . Regarding the platform and the vice presidency , the Right had everything its own way , and with the candidate 's enthusiastic blessing . The moderates could lump it . " The damn thing is , " remarked one Main-streamer , an alternate at the convention , " those people never could stand George Bush . " She meant the religious Right and ultraconservatives . " He was always our man . " By " our " she meant what the Robertson people liked to call the country-club set . She was watching " her man " being borne forward on the shields of the barbarians . Later in the week , Mainstreamers were speculating that everything might be different when Bush won election . he delegates , alternates , and guests present in the Superdome performed a function somewhere between that of a studio audience and a laugh track . The audience could hardly behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each speaker was a tiny figure unrecognizable across the Superdome 's great spaces . Huge Orwellian monitors displayed talking heads at various points around the arena so that , in the stands and on the floor , people faced in different directions , watching different screens . As a result , there was little sense of unity , no true crowd to become a single animal with a single voice in the grand old style . There were milling , isolated groups . The sound system that carried the speeches was particularly poor . In some parts of the Dome the speaker 's remarks were absolutely inaudible , For this reason , the prepared tapes that introduced the President on Monday night and George Bush on Thursday provoked a more emotional reaction than their remarks . Television speaks to isolation , and the 1988 Republican National Convention was television and little else . Being in the Super-dome was a little like being on a movie set or behind the scenes at a television studio . Late one night , CNN showed some footage of the 1952 Republican Convention , at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orotund , the general 's style was not well suited to a " cool medium . " The cameras saved him from absurdity only by keeping their distance . The world that this footage evoked seemed hard to imagine . It appeared to be a grayer , riskier , and somehow more serious place , more than a little frightening . The Republicans in New Orleans thirty-six years later were trying hard not to affright a soul . As noted earlier , it was morning ? all week , around the clock . The background colors on the monitors could adjust themselves as if by magic to tones complementary to the flesh and apparel of the speaker . The effect sought was similar to ognize their own social superiors can be said to have lost its innocence . So the convention , like the country , continued to puzzle over George Bush 's attempts to be a regular guy . Most of the week , the press eyeballed him like so many shrinks at a lunacy hearing , watching for popped synapses , spasms , and false moves . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of slightly hysterical finger-pointing when he referred to his grandchildren as ' ' the little brown ones " ; fortunately , it soon stopped . Eventually , to the relief and disappointment of many , he more or less made it through . By the time he stepped away from the podium on Thursday night he appeared to have weathered the passage from goofy diffidence to button-eyed vulgarity . The speech he made was of the sort generally described as " effective . " Bush delivered it convincingly and it was extremely optimistic , from a certain point of view . It described America as a rising nation and predicted a second American Century . That is certainly a sort of patriotism , although not necessarily the sort we require at this period in our history . At one point , in summing up our country 's achievements , he said we had " lit the world with our culture . " I thought " lit " sounded a trifle electric . Later in his text , the Vice President was made to describe himself as a " quiet man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiet " is not entirely the word for the way George Bush appears , but it is an extremely sympathetic way of describing it . " You are history , " said George Bush to " the drug dealers , " those swart banditos of American political song and legend . " Read my lips , " hedeclared to any who might doubt his resolve to hold the line on taxes . This colorful lingo was a property of the new Bush , the one with the common touch , capable of exchanging the idiom of the country day school for that of the regional junior high . So who is this George Bush ? You have to believe he 's a man who does good by stealth . No one in American public life is surrounded by so many favorable rumors and benign innuendos . Almost everyone who knows him personally says he 's wonderful . Yet publicly he appears ... " quiet . " The real point is that in order to become the Republican candidate for the presidency the Vice President has embraced some very intolerant and retrograde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , as he says of his stand on abortion , he has " changed his mind " on various issues . Bush may well ride his successful convention appearances all the way to the White House . Then , perhaps , the inner excellence he 's said to have will emerge in the fullness of time , expressed in policy . Perhaps not . And if George Bush does n't care what he 's really like , why should anyone else ? In August of 1988 , Bush took charge of a Reagan-enchanted party , rigid with complacency . Against the backdrop of contemporary New Orleans , the party 's convention looked even more unreal than its media specialists sought to make it . There are many other American landscapes upon which it would have appeared ephemeral and fantastic , not because of the lights and the music but because of what Bush might be induced to call ' ' the vision thing . " Again and again at this convention , speaker after Republican speaker affirmed that his party would carry this country into the future , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact they were promising to keep the future at bay . The future does not require the Republicans ; it will come . As the convention drew to a close , Bush left the podium and they released the balloons . It was a moment we 'd all been waiting for , and it was quite amusing to watch the balloons and confetti drift down past the cold ironical smiles of the foreign press corps . Not all of them looked ready for another American Century . Guests , the press , the delegates , and alternates began filing toward the exits . Outside , the air was heavy with impending rain , smelling of history . People went in groups , searching for the buses or peering anxiously up Loyola Avenue for a taxi . The future we 'd heard so much about was gathering in the darkness . The evening was ending as so many contemporary evenings do , in the search for a safe way home .
