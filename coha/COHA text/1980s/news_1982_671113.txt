The World Cup of soccer can only look better after last Friday ' s disgraceful business in Gijon , where West Germany waltzed to a 1-0 decision over Austria that helped both teams qualify for the second round and totally skewered tiny Algeria. // This tournament , held every four years , may yet produce the great moments that fans in front of television sets in all 24 time zones anticipate . In Spain , the tournament has not produced the amount of tourism that promoters had expected , but Spanish fans should fill stadiums in the two major cities for the second stage. // In the inland capital of Madrid , Austria will try to remember how to advance the ball in its game against France at 10 : 15 A.M. ( Eastern daylight time ) . In Barcelona , the lovely Catalan city of harbor and mountains , which has strong resemblances to both Paris and San Francisco , yellow and red banners hang everywhere to note the world festival here . Poland and Belgium will meet in the opening game in Barcelona today at 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 5 , when Brazil and Argentina are likely to clash in the small Sarria Stadium here . The winner of that game would go to the semifinals and would probably be the favorite to win the tournament , which Argentina won at home last year. // The World Cup badly needs an epic game to fumigate the aftermath of the Austria-West Germany duet last Friday , which had all the precision of professional waltzers performing in a Vienna park . The performance has touched off hundreds of calls of protest to television stations in West Germany and prompted some coaches in West Germany to wire apologies to Algerian officials. // For American fans to understand the slowdown , picture North Carolina ' s basketball team going into its four-corner stall after 10 minutes of a game , and helping the other team to advance also. // Almost all American playoffs are single-elimination or head-to-head competition . But in the first round of the World Cup , four teams play in a round robin , with two teams advancing. // This year the World Cup expanded from 16 to 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny a place to an unheralded third world team . One can only guess if Austria and West Germany would have played the same game if a major Western power were waiting with hopes to qualify . It is impossible to prove that the two teams worked in tandem - one can only look at the game. // If Austria won , West Germany was out . But if West Germany beat Austria by three goals or more , Austria was out . Either way , tiny Algeria , which , by beating West Germany , 2-1 , earlier , had already scored the greatest upset in the World Cup since North Korea beat Italy in 1966 , would advance to the second stage. // However , West Germany took a lead early and neither team tried to score after that . In the game , seen on English television during rain-plagued Wimbledon , West Germany made more kicks backward than forward after its goal . Austria , having nothing to lose by a 1-0 defeat - except pride - sacrificed all of that by not attempting to penetrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alli Sekkel , president of the Algerian Soccer Federation , demanded that both teams be barred for " scandalous behavior " and that the handful of Algerian fans tried to storm the field . But those were not Algerians who were screaming " Fuera ! Fuera ! " ( " Get out , get out " ) . Those were Spanish fans inflamed by injustice. // Sekkel later said : " It is an honor for Algeria that Germans and Austrians had to form a pact to be able to eliminate us. " // A prediction of how the Federation Internationale de Football Association ( F.I.F.A. ) will handle the incident is in the remarks by Hermann Neuberger , president of the West Germany Football Federation and also a vice president of F.I.F.A. He said : " The German team has the right to play slowly and defensively , with security . " Both coaches said they resented the charges of collusion . Jupp Derwall , the coach of the West German team , said : " We had the perfect right to be careful in this game in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But his defensiveness on the field and off touched off protests back home and a public outcry in the host country . Spanish fans are likely to establish Austria and West Germany as the two least favorites in the Madrid group. // The biggest surprise among the 12 surviving teams is Northern Ireland , which had not qualified for the World Cup since it was a surprise semifinalist in 1958 . Before the tournament , Jimmy Nicholl , who plays for the Toronto Blizzard in the North American Soccer League , said he remembered watching tiny North Korea beat Italy and scare Portugal before losing , 5-3 , in 1966 . He said he wanted his Northern Ireland team to be the North Korea of this year. // Northern Ireland did better , even though its managers had booked the team on a return flight to Belfast after the first round and neglected to make hotel reservations for the second round . Needing a victory over Spain to advance , it beat the host team , 1-0 , last Friday. // The Spaniards knew they could edge Yugoslavia for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unlike Austria , they did not play defensively and fought their hearts out in an attempt to tie Northern Ireland . ( To celebrate the extension of their tournament , two Northern Ireland players staged a street brawl with each other at 6 A.M. after the big game. ) // That game was one of the roughest of the tournament , and it proved once again how hard it is to be objective in sports . While Spanish fans screamed at the aggressiveness of the visitors , the commentators on English television noted only the aggressiveness of the Spaniards. // When Juanito ( Juan Gomez ) of Spain was given a yellow card as a warning by the officials , the British commentator was sure the Spanish player had tried to pull the hair of a Northern Ireland player. // By watching the body language over the television , this observer was sure Juanito had merely given the Northern Ireland player a rough pat on the back as if to say : " Sorry - let ' s keep playing . " But Juanito got a yellow card. // Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes saw Donaghy crash into the back of a Spanish player long after the ball had gone out of bounds , but the commentators felt it was only a bit of unavoidable roughness . Violence , like beauty , is in the eye of the beholder. // No sporting event - not the so-called " World Series " of North American baseball , not the Olympics - stirs up nationalistic emotions the way the World Cup does . Now Madrid and Barcelona are pulsing with fans from a dozen nations and proud Spanish and Catalan hosts are going out of their way to provide a warm welcome . They know that for the next two weeks the world ' s eyes will be on Spain. //
