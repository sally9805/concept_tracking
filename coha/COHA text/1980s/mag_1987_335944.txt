She is the daughter of the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , once the Prime Minister of Pakistan . While still in her 20s , she rallied the supporters of her Western-educated father after he was overthrown in a 1977 military coup and hanged two years later . She became the official opposition leader in 1986 and a strong challenger to her father 's nemesis , President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq . Last week the articulate Benazir Bhutto , 34 , a graduate of Harvard and Oxford , astonished friends and foes alike by announcing that she had agreed to an arranged marriage to a wealthy Pakistani businessman whom she had met only twice before . <P> The prospective bridegroom is Asif Ali Zardari , 34 , a handlebar-mustached building contractor and polo player . Like Bhutto , he is a member of a landowning family from Sind province . His father , once a supporter of Prime Minister Bhutto , remains active in opposition politics . The Zardari family reportedly broached the subject of marriage to Benazir 's mother and aunt last year . Benazir and Asif subsequently met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together again until two weeks ago , in London . Five days later the marriage plans were announced . <P> ( Bhutto explained that her decision had been based on " religious obligation and family duty , " as well as political considerations . " My brothers and my sister had love marriages , so I 'm the only one in the family not to have one , " she said in an interview with the New York Times . Ordinary Western- style dating had seemed out of the question in Pakistan . " For me , as leader of a Muslim party , it would just not do , " she said . After meeting Zardari , she decided that he was " nice and had a sense of humor and seemed to be a tolerant person ( ( who ) ) could handle having a wife who had an independent career of her own . " The wedding will probably not take place until winter , by which time her followers  --  and Benazir  --  should have grown accustomed to the idea .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
