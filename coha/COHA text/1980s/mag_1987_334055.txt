The cruel Catch-22 of welfare is that it often punishes recipients who try to work their way out of poverty . By taking away benefits from the poor when their income starts to climb , welfare discourages incentive . A novel program in Washington State proposes to turn that problem on its head by offering bonuses as well as benefits to welfare recipients who work or undergo job training . In effect , Washington wants to tell the poor : Whatever you earn ( up to a point ) , you can keep  --  and we 'll add to it . <P> Under the Family Independence Program proposed last November by Governor Booth Gardner , the incentives for working are substantial . A woman with two children earning close to minimum wage might take home as much as $10,464 a year : $7,752 in salary and government benefits , plus an additional $2,712 in bonuses . That is 15% above the current poverty level for a family of three . As the wages of a participant increase , the bonuses and benefits gradually decrease . The enrollee loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> FIP 's sponsors must first guide it through a vote in the state legislature , then ask the U.S. Congress for permission to replace such long-standard outlays as Aid to Families with Dependent Children , food stamps and Medicaid . The federal money earmarked for those programs would be matched with state grants and poured into new benefits , bonuses , job training and family-planning courses , as well as subsidies for the private employers who are expected to absorb two-thirds of the FIP graduates . <P> Olympia 's approach may well find support in Congress . Last week a study by the Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate recommended that federal officials consider replacing traditional benefits with so-called workfare subsidies that pay welfare recipients to undergo job training . The report proposes that states be allowed to experiment more freely with welfare . <P> If approved , the Family Independence Program will be stringently applied . All families on welfare , including women with infants as young as six months , would be enrolled within two years . Other states ' workfare programs exempt mothers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to disability or who must care for an infirm family member will continue to receive regular benefits . Those who can work yet refuse to do so will have their grants cut by 20% . <P> Critics are apprehensive about the program 's goal of full employment for the indigent . Says Phil Kaplan , a Washington State welfare-rights advocate : " The pressure on women to leave their children and go to work could increase the chances of abuse or neglect . The program puts infants and toddlers on the firing line . " Some members of the legislature also doubt that the state economy can create the 72,000 jobs required to absorb FIP trainees and others entering the market by 1990 . <P> Gardner replies that the state can solve both the employment and infant-care problems by putting welfare mothers to work in day-care centers , which are expected to grow through state subsidies from an $8 million-a-year business to $116 million a year . FIP , he says , " wo n't cost more than the current welfare program , and it wo n't save money either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers and families . "
