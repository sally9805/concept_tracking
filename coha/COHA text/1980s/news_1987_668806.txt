Ten years after the mini-series " Roots " changed accepted notions of prime-time TV programming and four years after ABC confronted the issue of a nuclear holocaust with " The Day After , " network entertainment chief Brandon Stoddard , who played a role in both of those productions , is gambling on " Amerika . " The controversial 14 1/2-hour mini-series , which airs on Channel 7 beginning Sunday night and continues nightly through Friday before concluding on Feb. 22 , has produced wails from the political left , an abandonment by Chrysler Corp. as a sponsor , consternation at some affiliate stations , the threat of lawsuits by the United Nations , official protests from the Soviet Union , nasty letters from three former U.S. ambassadors to the U.N. and a pervasive sense that " Amerika , " with its $35 million budget , could be a risky business indeed for a struggling network . Briefly , " Amerika " is a fictional account of life in the United States 10 years after a Soviet occupation . Performers include Kris Kristofferson , Robert Urich , Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Amerika " came from Stoddard , the mini-series itself from one Donald Wrye , who is listed as executive producer , writer and director . Richard L. O ' Connor is the producer . As the production of " Amerika " raced to a conclusion earlier this month , O ' Connor addressed the firestorm of criticism and the fleeing of sponsors that has dogged the ABC Circle Films effort . " We ' ve been thunderstruck by some of what we ' ve heard and seen , " he said in a telephone interview . " In one very real sense this is a television show , a piece of entertainment . " If people want to watch it and say it stinks , that ' s fine . But when people in Moscow threaten to expel the ABC News bureau chief if the network airs it , and when you ' re confronted with the sort of commercial pre-censorship that you have to read into what Chrysler did , it ' s hard to fathom the tremendous opposition to this theme . " The theme , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community than world politics , turns on the life and times of Milford , Neb. , a decade after a Soviet takeover of the U.S. Devin Milford ( Kristofferson ) is a former presidential candidate just out of American gulag in Texas after six years of confinement . Placed in internal exile , he is confined to a 25-mile radius of Milford and denied permission to visit his ex-wife and children . What he finds is an America without freedom , a nation of food lines and rationing , of travel restrictions and censorship and propaganda . A group called the United Nations Special Services Unit administers the country for the Soviets . Peter Bradford ( Robert Urich ) is Milford ' s former roommate , a politician caught up in the occupation , a pragmatist or a collaborator , depending on your perspective . His wife , Amanda ( Cindy Pickett ) , is Devin Milford ' s former lover , a woman who grows to hate the occupation and her husband ' s role in it . Set down in this community is Col. Andrei Denisov ( Sam Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-state " Heartland " region but a man torn by his own fascination with and love for the America he knew before the occupation . Rebellion is inevitable , of course , led by Devin Milford and his sister , Alethea ( Christine Lahti ) , once a collaborator . In an interview with TV critics recently Donald Wrye explained his " parable " this way : " ( The program ) deals with rather fundamental American principles which should be , in my view , of common agreement  --  the nature of the individual in a free society and the responsibility of that individual in maintaining a viable democratic society . It ' s not even about socialism versus capitalism . It ' s about democracy versus totalitarianism . " Objection to " Amerika " primarily has come from the political left . Wrye and company have been accused of poisoning the well of U.S.-Soviet relations , of characterizing the U.N. as a tool of the Soviets and , in the words of former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union George Kennan , committing " a serious disservice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " On different occasions Wrye has called his handiwork " a fable , " " a parable " and " an apolitical work . " Such semantic maneuverings have not helped clear the air , nor have confusing statements like : " ' Amerika ' is trying to deal with the nature of who we are as a people today , not a hypothetical possibility of a Soviet takeover . " Even four hours of viewing make it obvious that , yes , " Amerika " is about the hypothetical possibility of a Soviet takeover . Interestingly , the earliest criticism of " Amerika " came on the basis of rumors , leaks from ABC and a shooting script . At this writing , only four hours of the mini-series have been made available to the press , and Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca saw only six hours before pulling his ads , to the tune of nearly $7 million . According to a spokesman for Chrysler , the company ' s objections centered on the " downbeat " nature of the program . The vision of " Amerika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Pride Is Back  --  Born in America " theme of the current Chrysler pitch . " The network has been under tremendous pressure , " O ' Connor said , " but we ' ve been told to go ahead and finish our work . There hasn ' t been any real modification of the script , though we are going to offer a disclaimer about the role of the U.N. as it ' s portrayed here . " ABC offered a 30-minute show to its affiliates , " The Storm Over Amerika , " which contained interviews and a discussion of the issues in the controversy ( it was to air last Friday on WLS-Ch. 7 ) . Many of the show ' s most fervent critics , wary of the censor ' s label , are calling for ABC and local stations to offer " balanced " viewing , such as panel discussions and forums on U.S.-Soviet relations and other matters . A few similar programs were aired following " The Day After " in 1983 . ABC ' s " Nightline " will devote part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but at this writing no other network format for " balancing " had been offered . O ' Connor points out that for all the hoopla , " Amerika " remains just a television program , if a ludicrously long one . " I told people here that in a few weeks we ' ll be on the air , " he said . " And a week later we ' ll be off . " Chances are that about as many people will be offended by " Amerika " as were offended by " The Day After . " Politically , of course , they won ' t be the same group . In 1983 , right-wing objections to " The Day After " accused ABC of taking a pro-nuclear freeze position . Now the same network is being charged with pandering to right-wingers and militarists . Ultimately , the first principle of television viewing stands : If you don ' t like what you ' re seeing , turn it off .
