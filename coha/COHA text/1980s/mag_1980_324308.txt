For journalists , caught up in the swirl of fast-breaking events , it is sometimes easy to neglect the longer view , to forget the lessons of history . At TIME , we try to make the past a frequent companion . Every so often the magazine does a cover story on a figure of both historical significance and current concern : Adam Smith ( the future of capitalism , 1975 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( the nation 's Bicentennial , 1975 ) and , this week , the American past . Our subject , on the eve of Independence Day , is history itself , specifically the growing reappraisal by historians and ordinary citizens alike of the civics-book homilies that once passed for U.S. history . <P> The story was written by Senior Writer Lance Morrow , whose distinctive TIME Essays have attracted something of a following among readers . Columnist William F. Buckley has described Morrow 's style as a blend of " pyrotechnics and lyricism . " Says Senior Editor Otto Friedrich , who edited this week 's story : <P> " Since Lance wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S Bicentennial issue and on the Bill of Rights for our follow-up issue a year later , he seemed the inescapable choice for this journey into history . He was there . " <P> For the past four years , Morrow has been a principal writer of the TIME Essay , which he calls " a combination of editorial , crank letter and private meditation . " A onetime U.S. Senate page and Harvard English major , he came to the magazine in 1965 from the Washington Star . He has a bit of family history on his office wall : an old photo of Great-Grandfather Albert Morrow , a 19th century U.S. Cavalry officer . The younger Morrow 's meditation on the rediscovery of America appears in the Nation section , but he brings to the subject the same subtlety , wit and fascination with new concepts that animate his Essays . Says Morrow : " For me , ideas possess both drama and real , physical , palpable force . " <P> Morrow was assisted by Reporter-Researcher Peggy Berman , who dug into more than 60 history books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American students . The subject is not foreign to her . Though a science major at Smith College , she spent part of her student days reading history and attending lectures on the subject . " I think I have always been drawn to history for the same reason I majored in biological sciences , " she says . " Both subjects tie people into the infinitely longer scheme of life . When you integrate all the pieces , that 's the fun of it . History is a good story . " <P> John A. Meyers
