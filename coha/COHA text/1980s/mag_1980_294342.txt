Unlike Europe , where land and climate suitable for noble vines are very limited and the great wine estates are centuries old , California has a vast amount of hospitable acreage and an ever increasing number of nouveaux wineries . While the state has a dozen long-established firms that annually produce more than 2 million cases ( 4.5 million gal. ) each , some of the most interesting wines are being made by comparatively small estates that have started up in the past two decades . They are owned by engineers and airline pilots , big businessmen and corporations . Most of the bottles shipped by such wineries as Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars , Chappellet , Santa Ynez , Burgess , Joseph Swan , Sanford &; Benedict , J. Lohr , Keenan , Heitz and Chateau St. Jean are instant sellouts-often at higher prices than comparable French , Italian or German vintages . A tasting : <P> Sterling Vineyards . One of the biggest of the smallest , Coca-Cola-owned Sterling is the largest winery in the U.S. to produce only estate-bottled wines , European style . Opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Napa is Indian for " plenty " ) , Sterling is best known for its reds , notably a subtle Cabernet Sauvignon that sells for up to $20 a bottle . Under Dutch-born Winemaster Theo Rosenbrand , Sterling plans to increase production from 65,000 cases a year to 90,000 by 1985 , at the same time narrowing its range of varietals to concentrate on Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot , Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc . Its 1976 Cabernets and Pinots Noirs will be released this month , but should be put down for at least two years before they are uncorked . Sterling is probably the only winery in the world where visitors board an aerial tramway en route to the sampling room ; they get an intoxicating view of the vine-dappled valley below and Mount St. Helena beyond . <P> Joseph Phelps Vineyard . A medium-size winery ( 170 acres ) with an annual crush of some 45,000 cases , Phelps is known for its fruity , aromatic Riesling . Winemaster Walter Schug , who came to California from Germany , plans to keep production at the present level while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction tycoon , planted his first vines in 1973 on the slopes of Napa 's Spring Valley area . The winery is made of lumber from century-old railroad bridges ; its vineyards range from 200 ft. above sea level to 660 ft. , where mists and cool breezes are ideal for noble whites . Phelps also makes Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot , some of which are sold under the label Le Fleuron at a sensible price ( around $5.75 ) . In another of its several microclimates , at Yountville , Phelps grows Gewurztraminer , whose sweetish , slightly musky flavor is comparable to the famed white from its ancestral vines in Alsace and Germany . Says Schug : " The grape comes first . We do n't aim for a certain market . If you make fine wine , there are always people who will buy it . "
