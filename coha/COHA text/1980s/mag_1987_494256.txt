It is election eve , 1988 . Rebellious Democrats call upon their candidate , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , to remove Edward Kennedy from the ticket . Provoked by new revelations about Marilyn Monroe , Congress debates a Bill of Exclusion that would bar any member of the Kennedy family from succeeding to the presidency . The Dissenter 's Party , founded by loyalists of the seven candidates eliminated by scandal , declares a nationwide strike against the media . Meanwhile , the Republican candidate , Pat Robertson , has committed his party to a Test Act , requiring mandatory testing of every public official for drugs , AIDS , and atheism . Opinion polls reveal that 90 percent of the American people believe the great Santa Barbara quake to have been an act of divine retribution on sinful California . Now Maj. Titus Tonge , a former supporter of Lyndon LaRouche , claims to have proof that the quake was actually an underground nuclear explosion intended to assassinate the president . He implicates the pope and Fidel Castro . At first reporters laugh off this plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , subpoenas are slapped on Mario Cuomo and leading Latinos . A new comet is discovered . The Constitution is stolen . Iran makes peace with Iraq . Fifty banks default . Oliver North flees to the Soviet Union . And the most famous American poet writes a great poem comparing the current state of affairs to certain events in 17th-century England . Everybody reads it . This is , of course , a very improbable story . Strange things may happen in America ? but nothing quite so strange as that stuff about the poem . American poets do not write works like Absalom and Achifophel , and the American public does not read them . It can not be that material is lacking . The Popish Plot and the Earl of Shaftesbury are not inherently more interesting than the Iran-contra scandal and Robert Bork , nor do they offer richer models for satire or heroic tragedy . We live in fabulous times . Yet poets do not rise to the occasion . Where is John Dryden now that we need him ? He seems very distant . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what a poet is supposed to be . He does not seem to care much for the outdoors or the Self ; he pays more attention to the news of the day than to the mystery of things . He thinks of the poet as a social being , and of poetry as a social activity . He is not even ashamed to bepoet laureate . Worse yet , he actually gets along with people in power . In more romantic ages , many critics have found it hard to believe that such a being could be a poet at all . Yet this public figure , this man of the world , is not only one of the great poets in English ; he is probably the writer who has most influenced the language that everyone uses , the common style in which we write and think . This bears some thinking about . If Dryden is not what a poet is supposed to be , then perhaps it is our image of the poet , not Dryden , that needs refurbishing . Perhaps we can learn from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dryden " without any doubt , the Greatest Occasional Poet in English . " This is high praise from one pro to another . Only someone who has tried the public manner , voicing what is on everyone 's mind without insulting anyone 's intelligence , can appreciate the difficulty of the performance . Auden himself had mixed success as an occasional poet ; embarrassed at finding himself on stage , he worried about the temptation to lie and to charm , and his verse shows the strain . But others have not done it better . Ever since Dryden , the laureateship has been a running joke . Nor has there ever been a Great American Occasional Pbet . At their best our poets make themselves into a world , but they are not worldly . Just how does Dryden do it ? To begin with , he has a very firm sense of occasion . This sounds simpler than it is . Dryden 's poems seldom arise from an undefined situation , a subconscious urge , a spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings ; indeed , they are seldom voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface to a play , a song for St. Cecilia . Or perhaps some public event calls for notice : a king is crowned or overthrown , London is racked by fire and plague , an enemy attacks him , a promising young poet dies , a century comes to an end . It is the poet 's job to make those moments live forever . But first he has to understand the special character of the moment ? not only its meaning for him , but its place in history , politics , and society . Not even the grave is a private place for Dryden , because each death sets off ripples among family and the larger circle of acquaintance , stretching to posterity . Occasions matter to him . He cares about genealogy and succession ( apparently far more than he ever cared about his wife ) , and he never lets the precise circumstances of the event dissolve into poetic generalities . This poet lives full time in the here and now . Yet he also superimposes some other time and place on them . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real until it has happened twice , Thus Absalom and Achilophel is situated not in ancient Israel or in 17th-century England , but somewhere between them , in a state of surmise ( like my account of Election ' 88 ) . Dryden is a master of the higher doublethink , of that fusion of incongruities that blends two independent stories or characters into one timeless type ? not King David or Charles 11 , but the set that consists of both : He is not now , as when on Jordan 's sand The joyful people thronged to see him land , Covering the beach , and blackening all the strand ; But , like the Prince of Angels from his height , Comes tumbling downward with diminished light . Such effects come naturally to poets raised on Latin and Greek and the Bible . For Centuries British schoolboys were trained to inhabit an imaginary Rome or Jerusalem that was somehow more real than this rapidly passing London . But Dryden 's genius for allusicin especiallysuited his age . Restoration England was obsessed with finding historical parallels for itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deja vu . Perhaps at a time of such violent changes , when Britain threatened to tear itself apart , people took comfort in remarking that such things had all happened before , that they were in fact not alarming but strangely familiar . Dryden gives his public that reassurance . That is to say , he knows his audience . Many of his poems were aimed at specific people , and as a leading London playwright he could predict who would be in the theater . The usefulness of this keen , exact sense of audience is a third lesson that Dryden can teach . Like Timotheus in " Alexander 's Feast , " he knows just what strings to pull in order to make the puppets dance to his tune . But unlike Timotheus , he does not merely manipulate his audience ; he includes himself in it . As James Winn frequently points out in his fine new biography , Dryden 's favorite pronoun is " we . " This poet belongs to a group , or to a series of groups : family , party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom indulges the singular , personal " I. " Hence reading Dryden means reading Dryden'sworld . Part of his strength consists of the hosts that he summons around him , the friends who support him , the public he civilly asks to share his concerns . Nor does he forget what company his enemies keep . Even his archrival Shadwell is dissected , in " Mac : knoe , " not as a freak , but as the monarch of a mob of dunces . In an odd way the attack is hardly personal . It only nudges Shadwell to another world . In the last resort , however , a poet 's world is language , and it is in his language that Dryden lives . It seems so easy , so effortless a style because he worked so hard on it . According to Samuel Johnson 's famous formulation , Dryden found English poetry brick and left it marble . But the smoothness of the image is deceptive . The emperor Augustus could turn Rome to marble ( in the epigram of Suetonius that Johnson is adapting ) as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph of a one-party state ; but Dryden had to negotiate his language . He found English a political battlefield , and left it a common ground where different parties could meet . Even grace and wit of style were controversial in the mid-17th century ; the Cavaliers had used them as weapons against their sober , homespun foes . Many good words , such as " conscience " and " the people , " had been tarnished . The British had learned to hate one an-other 's accents . A French phrase , a biblical " thee , " a Latinate construction , a casual use of slang , a series of short , blunt words : each could declare an uncompromising political and religious allegiance . A poet devoted to peace and harmony would have to mold a new style . Such crises of language are far from uncommon . They occur whenever political feelings run high and poets feel an urgent need to address the public . The language , too long neglected , may not be there when they need it . During the Vietnam War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading at anti-war rallies , they realized that their usual styles were not loud enough . Some tried to sound like Whitman or Blake ; some like translations of Neruda . But these styles did not really suit the occasion ( Whitman was not only too long-winded , but too private , and not good at outrage ) . Folk music worked better . Moreover , some poets discovered that the anti-war style committed them , linguistically as well as politically , to positions that were not their own , as if they might have to turn into Allen Ginsberg against their will . American English itself , like postwar German , began to seem contaminated . It may not have recovered yet . Most of the poetry of that time has been mercifully forgotten , but the crisis in language was never resolved . No poet emerged who caught just the right public voice , and the style of American poetry soon returned to its private musings . Election ' 88 will have no bard . D RYDEN WAS different . Poets in his day were closer to power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , he worked for the government , perhaps in the same office where Milton and Marvell were employed ( though no record survives of how they got on together ) . More important , through both background and education he grew up acquainted with two distinct styles ? the plainspoken Puritan line of his family , and the more florid and classical Royalist manner he learned at Westminster School . Much of his art may be viewed as a reconciliation of those two modes . The nostalgia for the martyred king and the England that had passed , and the apocalyptic sense of a covenant renewed , join in his earliest work and survive to the end , when the poet himself had fallen from political favor . To make them join , Dryden had to find a common thread , and he found it in the energy and clarity of argument that the warring parties had used against each other : Thus have I made my own opinions clear , Yet neither praise expect , nor censure Fear ; And this unpolished , rugged verse , I chose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a style that is equal to many occasions . Capable of extreme aristocratic finesse , as in Dryden 's famous remark that the best satire disdains " the slovenly butchering of a man " and prefers " the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body , and leaves it standing in its place , " it is also capable of unaffected directness . Anyone who knows English can understand it , Dryden , one of the least democratic of poets , developed the most democratic of styles . It was also a style made to last . In the late 17th century ? when the language was changing so rapidly that Shakespeare began to seem antique , as if he might need translation ( like Chaucer ) into modern English ? many writersfeared that the next generation would not be able to read them . That did not happen . Three hundred years later , Dryden remains easier to read than many of our contemporaries . This is a remarkable fact . We live in a world where English has been scattered all over the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the language of that vanished time and place , that little court and church . The reasons for this peculiar equilibrium are massive and complex . No one author can be given much of the credit . But Dryden played his part . He wrote for empires yet unborn , and honed a style so sharp and clear that time could not obscure it . Yet even the best occasional verse does run into one problem : the reader has to know something in order to get the point . Who is this Achitophel , this milk-white hind , this Robert Howard , this Flecknoe ? Who will know Pat Robertson 's name a few years from now ? Above all , who will care ? Occasional verse can seem as monumentally boring as the local news in a foreign paper , or as a ball game in which no one keeps score . Dryden has to have footnotes ? not for the sake of scholarship , just to make basic sense . In this respect Winn 's book performs a valuable service . Informative , wide-ranging , accessibly written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then some . Many details of Dryden 's poetry take on a new life . For instance , any reader who has been horrified by Alexander 's " zeal to destroy " the homes and temples of his conquered enemies ought to know what Dryden thought about King William 's militarism . Winn charts the tangled course of the poet 's religious and political alliances , and does not neglect to note who paid his bills . No previous biography has been so rich , or placed this man of the world so firmly in the world around him . What remains elusive , however , is the man himself . What was Dryden like in private ? Surprisingly little is known , and much of that little comes from the scandalous gossip that his enemies spread . We owe them the hint that Dryden had an affair with an actress , Anne Reeves ; and Winn has been wonderfully thorough in tracking down every scrap of fact about her ( she had good legs and may have become a nun ) . But hard evidence tends to be lacking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang of hired thugs , the precise motives for the beating never came out . Winn does what he can . He works especially hard at showing how intimate Dryden could be with his public , how deftly he managed to draw the audience in . Something like a personality does in fact emerge . Yet we still do not know much about who Dryden was when he was at home . Perhaps that is just as well . For Dryden satisfies a different need . There are plenty of marvelous anti-establishment poets , plenty of poets who tell us about their intense inner lives , plenty of poets who cherish a wish to be offered a government laurel so that they could turn it down , and more than enough poetic selves to go around . But not many poets since Dryden have known how to func- intion in public , or possibly even be among the acknowledged legislators of the world . Dryden gives us back a sense of what it means to live in a particular time and place , to feel oneself a part of history even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath him to influence opinion or sway a jury , even by making it laugh . Above all he enjoys the world for what it is . Not everything a modern reader wants from poetry is to be found in Dryden . He is not a romantic figure . But no other poet can tell us more about the next election .
