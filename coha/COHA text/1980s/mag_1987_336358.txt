It should have been the best of times , but it was the worst of times for Joseph Biden . For months it had been a truth universally acknowledged : that the Senator in want of the presidency could revive his flagging candidacy as he presided over the Robert Bork confirmation hearings . But , oh , the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune . Before Bork even took the witness stand , Biden learned the hard way that 1988 presidential politics has become a school for scandal . Now many believe that Biden 's beleaguered candidacy has almost certainly shuffled off its mortal coil . But the defiant candidate still insists that the whole flap is " much ado about nothing . " <P> One thing is for sure : Joe Biden has surmounted his name-recognition problem . In fact , he received more exposure last week than he may be able to bear . Serious students of public affairs probably noticed that he performed competently , but far from memorably , at the Bork hearings . But what most voters are more likely to remember was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign trail juxtaposed with almost identical oratory coming from the mouth of Robert Kennedy , Hubert Humphrey and British Labor Party Leader Neil Kinnock . English teachers in New Hampshire high schools were soon using Biden as the bad example in lessons on the evils of plagiarism . <P> What might be called the Glib Crib Crisis began when the New York Times revealed that Biden had been guilty of rhetorical shoplifting . Biden 's passionate and seemingly personal closing statement in a Democratic debate in Iowa in late August had been swiped without attribution and almost word for word from a Kinnock TV commercial designed to evoke memories of the British class struggle . Where Kinnock 's coal-mining ancestors worked " eight hours underground , " Biden 's somewhat mythical forebears " would come up after twelve hours . " Biden in the past had given credit to Kinnock , but in Iowa he introduced the fiery rhetoric by deceptively claiming , " I started thinking as I was coming over here . . . " To make matters worse , Biden repeated the offense in a tape he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was clearly folly for Biden to expropriate Kinnock 's family tree as he conjured up coal-mining ancestors " who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse . " But hitherto , politics has been far more tolerant of borrowings from Bartlett 's than of monkey business in Bimini . In fact , some of the most famous lines of modern oratory have questionable paternity . Winston Churchill 's " blood , toil , tears and sweat " was inspired by John Donne ; John Kennedy 's " Ask not what your country can do for you " echoed Oliver Wendell Holmes ; and Ronald Reagan 's 1980 debate cry , " I am paying for this microphone , " was apparently lifted from a 1948 movie , State of the Union . <P> Why , then , has Biden become a modern-day Jean Valjean , condemned to suffer permanently for the political equivalent of stealing a loaf of bread ? Biden is more than a hapless victim , since his Gatling-gun rhetoric certainly compounded the problem . Still , the Biden brouhaha illustrates the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A Pre-Existing Subtext . " The basic rap against Biden , " explains Democratic Pollster Geoff Garin , " is that he 's a candidate of style , not substance . "
