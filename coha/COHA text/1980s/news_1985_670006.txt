Some analysts have considered Eckerd an attractive takeover target since early last summer , when it accumulated about $200 million in cash from the sale of two units , its J. Byrons department stores and American Home Video Corp . A spokesman for the drugstore chain said the company opted for a buyout because " there has been a lot of uncertainty surrounding the company ' s future . " In mid-July Eckerd bought back a 5% stake held in it by one potential suitor , the Dart Group Corp. of Landover , Md . Investment banking sources close to Eckerd said Jack Eckerd , the company ' s founder , was jolted by the unsolicited interest shown by Dart , and was afraid that another hostile suitor might materialize . " You have to remember that the company is his life ' s work , " one investment banker said . " And it would mean a lot for him to see it continue as a stable , independent entity , " he added .

Reached at a private office , Mr. Eckerd said the management buyout " was the best of all the options we considered . " He wouldn ' t elaborate . Since Dart displayed and then dropped an interest in Eckerd , the Eckerd spokesman said , " We ' ve had a lot of inquiries and we ' ve had discussions with a number of them . " However , the spokesman said , none of the outside inquiries resulted in firm bids . Stewart Turley , chairman , said in a press release that the board had determined since July that a management buyout " would be in the best interests of the company , our shareholders and our employees , " because it would permit the company to continue " as an independent entity . " " People have been talking $30 to $35 a share , so I would say $33 is a fair price , assuming the debenture is really worth $5 present value , " says William Smith , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris , Upham &; Co .
