The Dutch crew of two men and one woman waited anxiously in Newfoundland for a month before conditions finally allowed them to launch their 46-meter-tall balloon . But at last they caught the weather just right . After a flawless flight across the Atlantic , Pilot Henk Brink , 42 , his wife Evelien , 31 , and Fighter Pilot Willem Hageman , 39 , last week became the first Europeans to accomplish the balloon voyage and , with a time of 51 hrs. 14 min. , shaved more than a day off the old record . " A piece of cake , " said Hageman . The only hitch in their speedy journey ( up to 76 m.p.h. ) was when the Dutch Viking touched down a little fast in a wheatfield twelve miles east of Amsterdam ; Brink was thrown out of the gondola and slightly injured his hip . The $2 million trip 's highlight ? Evelien loved " sitting on the afterdeck at night and enjoying the constellation ( while ) the balloon turned continually . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
