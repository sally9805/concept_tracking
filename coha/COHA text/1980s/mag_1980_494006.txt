The Scapegoat by Mary Lee Settle ( Random House , $11,95 ) In The Scapegoat , Mary Lee Settle illuminates a moment in the American past , a West Virginia coal miners ' strike in 1912 , so exhaustively , so au thoritative /y , that her technique ? a dozen voices speaking out of their own involvement ? convinces us that it is the only plausible way to pay honor to the complexities of social history . We hear these speakers in passionate antagonm , each representing the force of his orisher own kind : the impatient , vindictive detectives hired to keep the peace ( or to coerce 3 ) ; a pathetic crew of foreign scabs called " transportation , " who have no idea what they 've been imported to do and who aoved about like herds , silent withoure t a mcommon language ; the striking miners , especially a group of Italians who always will be foreigners , even in this permanent home ; Beverley Lacey , one of the few mine owners who want to negotiate but who , nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strikers for the protection of his girls and his wife in their white dresses ; those girls themselves , each ambitious i a different way ; Jake Catlett , strike len ader and friend of Lacey 's who is not eager to oppose him but whose integrity compels him to ; and a marvelous , not at all voiceless contingent of women whose anger the real Mother Jones ( whose speeches are adapted from transcripts ) arrives to orchestrate into a demonstration that changes nothing but their internal sense of power : " These women would n't forget , and they would n't let their children forget . " And there is Mother Jones herself , in her bombazine , dressed like a Victorian lady on her way to church , a passionate cynic beyond intimidation , who plays her crowd with tiny variations in pitch and rhythm , forgetting for an instant that they are women who wo n't dare laugh out loud when she pleases herself by calling Governor Glasscock " Crystal Peter , " stirring up incidents to use as bait when she needs to stir them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much moved as enlightened by these voices . The Scapegoat is not an angry or disillusioned book so much as an unillusioned one . From its opening " testimony " by the mine owner 's adolescent daughter hid- ing behind the rambler roses , who is certain she " did n't miss a thing " during the strike , we see Settle 's people locked into their places in the intricate schemes of class . A few flail and heave in their traces and one even escapes and begins the long climb from faceless labor , literally rides out of town before the mob in borrowed clothes . But for the most part , on this one long day at the climax of the strike ( with a few short , privileged asides from the future ) , they are doomed to play out their roles earnestly and narrowly .

These characters are only another generation , an instant , in the life of the land . As the issues turn complex , and Indian wars and epidemics seem straightforward w comparison , Settle 's multifaceted narrative bears witness to the change . The most pathetic of these descendants is Beverley Lacey ( last of the male line of the Jonathan Lacey who figured largely in 0 Beulah bad ) , now owner of one of the mines , who wants to negotiate with the union but is too weak to prevail . His father , who had opened a coalfield , made money and lost it , been to war and back , stays on into his middle age as a haunting voice reminding Beverley of all the things he will never be A paternalist , a man of outmoded convictions , he had taken Beverley into the mines as a young man in spite of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had .

" When a man 's fate has already been decided for 50 million years because his land happens o be over a seam of coal he 's licked before he starts , " is the way Beverley ays it , putting a very different emphais on the legacy of the mountains .

If he is not the one they 'd intended , they all look alike ; he is hardly worth the weeping . Of Lacey 's three talkative daughters , two rake a self-absorbed and apolitical view of the struggle . It is the third , Lily , who stands closest to the center of the book , though she is not an easily likable heroine . Lily has been to Vassar , where she has learned about life ( or at least discovered socialism and women 's suffrage ) . According to her sister she has " an ironing board body and a critical soul ? she has always refused to let us not notice things " As such Lily is a perfect character for Settle to have placed in the midst of the action as an unwitting catalyst for the forces of violence ? she is yearning , confused , strong-willed , desperate to be of use in changing the world , but dangerously innocent .

Right to the end , when Lily sees the miners ' wi in their aprons , to her " they moved ves like animals .... Bacchante , she thought and was pleased at that . She liked classic references .... It was education they needed . " At which point , since , alas , not everyone can go to Vassar , she forgives them . Settle gives Lily a chance at redemption the others in the book never have . We see here few years later , in a section set during the war when she is working as a nurse in France . By now , minister- ing to the victims of a far uglier battle than the miners , she has some perspective on the events of 1912 , " the pathos of her family 's innoce ce , n " and the smallness of the scale on which that drama played itself out .

The , are moments of surpassingly lovely writing and a fine feeling for the geography of these hillsides . There is a startling moment when a warning is sung in code ? in Italian ? to the strikrs . There are the lyrical meanderings of Lacey 's worn , lonely wife , Ann Eldridge , a deadly , conventional woman to her daughter but an isolated , unhappy wife whose dreams for herself are much less alienating from our perspective . There are also lapses . One , whom we get at length , is the black-dressed figure of the Italian mother , whose passions and peasant 's fortitude make her too familiar , however many of her kind may have existed at this time , in this place .

But such flaws amount to little in this absorbing and ambitious book . The Scapegoat is a lively and bitter demonstration that most ( but not all of or will never overcome the limitations of our own and our family 's partisan vision but will live out our lives where we have , indifferently , been placed in the order of doer and done-to . That is no rigid Hardyan determinism , it is only a realistic reading of the record .
