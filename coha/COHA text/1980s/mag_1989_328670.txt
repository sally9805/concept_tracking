The horrible story had circulated in the halls of Glen Ridge ( N.J. ) High School for months . Last week the scandal broke into the open when police arrested five teenagers and charged them with sexually attacking a mentally impaired 17-year-old girl . According to investigators , the girl was invited to the home of two of the youths on March 1 , where she was forced by the five suspects to perform sexual acts and violated with a broomstick and miniature baseball bat while eight other young men watched . <P> The crime has convulsed Glen Ridge , a well-off community of 7,700 that likes to think of itself as a large family . The girl has known at least two of the youths since grammar school ; she and the accused are white . The alleged assailants are among the town 's favored sons : Kyle and Kevin Scherzer , 18- year-old twins , and Peter Quigley , also 18 , are stars of the football team . The two other youths who were arrested were under 18 at the time of the attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight onlookers : the 18-year-old son of a local police lieutenant . <P> The news of the assault comes less than two months after the entire nation was shocked by the gang rape and near fatal beating of a white jogger in New York City 's Central Park , allegedly by six black and Hispanic youths . Taken together , the two cases brutally demonstrate that sexual violence by adolescents transcends racial and class lines . Such attacks are now increasingly common across the U.S. According to the FBI , the number of arrests for rape committed by boys 18 years old or younger rose by 14.6% between 1983 and 1987 . <P> In Los Angeles last April , a twelve-year-old girl was kidnaped and assaulted over the next four days by dozens of teenage members of the Rolling 40s Crips gang . Five months ago in Columbia , S.C. , two boys ages 13 and 14 were charged with raping an eleven-year-old girl in school . In Houston last October , three youths ages 14 , 15 and 16 abducted and raped a 26-year-old woman during a three-day crime spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippling pool of fear . Some teachers now send little girls to the bathroom in pairs . Young women say they are afraid to take a shower or run the hair dryer ; the noise could mask an assailant 's approach . At college parties , many coeds clutch their cocktail glasses , worried that knockout drops could be slipped into their drinks . <P> Many people fear gang rapes or being the random target of a sociopath . In fact , say many experts , the offending youth most often acts alone , is a respectable member of the community and knows the victim . So-called date rape is one of the most common adolescent sexual crimes . <P> What leads young men to commit such deeds ? It has become a truism to say that rape is an act of violence , not of sex . But experts insist that sexual gratification is a factor in attacks by adolescents . The teen years are ones of intense sexual stirrings and strong aggressive impulses . And many youths are simply socially inept and unable to woo female affection . Frustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
