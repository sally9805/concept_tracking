GALAS at the Ridiculous Theatrical Company <P> Such are the demands of art that great performers must often display their power and grace in the most outlandish haberdashery . Watch Julius Erving in short pants , Mikhail Baryshnikov in tights-or Charles Ludlam in a turquoise-and-orange evening dress . It is true that Ludlam , the founder , artistic director , playwright-in-residence , director and shining star of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company , can often be seen striding the tiny stage of his Greenwich Village theater in trousers . He has trod these boards as the satyric Bluebeard , as Ebenezer Scrooge , as a neurotic shrink in Reverse Psychology , even as Rufus Foufas , a bamboozled patron of the arts in Le Bourgeois Avant-Garde . But nothing brings out a farceur 's spirit of adventure like a cunning little Empire nightgown . It was as a delicately audacious Marguerite Gautier in his 1973 Camille that Ludlam first broke out of the circle of his off-off-Broadway camp followers and into more general acclaim . Ten years later he is packing them into the Ridiculous with his impersonation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludlam traces every seismic bump in the career of Maria Magdalena Galas : her fierce determination to be a star ( " I am a musician , I am a musical instrument , I am music ! " ) ; her marriage to the millionaire brickmaker Giovanni Baptista Mercanteggini ( " Bricks , of all things , " Maria demurely deadpans on learning of his trade ) ; her dalliance with the Greek tycoon Aristotle Plato Socrates Odysseus ( who admits that he finds Maria " a suitable object for worship " ) ; her sparring with Pope Sixtus VII over matters musical ( " I 'm Greek Orthodox , " she explains to a friend . " To me he 's just another bishop " ) ; her triumphs and decline ( " Where is my voice ? I call it and call it and it will not answer " ) ; her tragic early death as she ascends into delirium and stabs herself with a stiletto concealed in the ribbing of her Tosca fan . Then Ludlam brings his audience back to earth with a deliciously silly curtain call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which include burlesques of Wagner , sci-fi movies , high fashion , sexual fads and children 's puppet shows ) , Galas means to be , well , ridiculous . And this diva is frequently a figure of bawdy fun . Crossing her legs , smoothing her hair , blowing a kiss , myopically eyeing a newspaper story , waving a black-gloved finger under the Pope 's nose , manipulating that goofy face into a thousand contortions of hauteur and despair , Ludlam 's Galas pushes the mannerisms of every grandi ose superstar from Traubel to Tallulah one octave higher to achieve parody in perfect pitch . <P> By the climax , Ludlam has moved from funny halfway to sublime . He does not keep the satirist 's distance from Galas ; he inhabits her , and turns ram shackle farce into full-throated melodrama . <P> Leading a band of faithful players who dare only to flirt with competence , producing his extravaganzas on shoestring budgets , Ludlam is a star in the vanishing tradition of the actor-manager . The Ludlam line may go back even further , to the capering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wickedly contemporary show-biz savvy , this clown prince is putting the art back in commedia dell ' arte . <P> <P> - By Richard Corliss
