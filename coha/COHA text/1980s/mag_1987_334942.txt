At the Ouadi-Doum air base , the stench of death was overpowering . Inside the onetime Libyan stronghold , which was overrun by Chadian troops in March , the unburied bodies of five Libyan pilots lay in a pit . Nearby , some 30 Soviet and Czech jet fighters , half of them unscathed , glittered in the sun . The aircraft were a small part of the advanced Soviet bloc weaponry that the forces of Libya 's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi left behind as they fled . The value of the abandoned materiel , along with the base itself and Libyan armaments lost in other desert battles , was estimated at nearly $1 billion . <P> The victory at Ouadi-Doum capped a remarkable Chadian drive that has all but ended 3 1/2 years of Libyan occupation of the north . When Western reporters toured battle sites recently , they found evidence that Gaddafi 's fleeing troops had in some places laid down their arms without firing a shot . Near the oasis town of Faya-Largeau , the Libyans abandoned a column of Soviet- made T-55 tanks with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonanza for Chadian forces , which routed the enemy by attacking aboard Toyota pickup trucks mounted with light machine guns . Among the haul were more than 200 tanks and armored personnel carriers , countless rounds of ammunition and two giant early-warning radar systems . Western intelligence experts were delighted by the capture of three batteries of Soviet-made SA-6 surface-to-air missiles complete with radar guidance systems . <P> In spite of the magnitude of his victory , Chadian President Hisene Habre still has problems to solve . Foremost among them : he must reach an accord with Rebel Leader Goukouni Oueddei , a former President of Chad himself and Gaddafi ally whose forces last year joined with Habre 's to help defeat the Libyans . But after an unproductive meeting last week between Goukouni and Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny , who is trying to mediate between the two leaders , the President and the rebel commander reportedly remain far apart on issues ranging from Chad 's provisional constitution to Goukouni 's role in a new government . <P> Gaddafi , for his part , emerged last week in Tripoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya . After stepping onto a platform before an audience of some 500 mostly foreign guests , Gaddafi inexplicably turned around and left . Aides could not account for the mercurial leader 's sudden exit , which left the four-day anti- American get-together to speakers ranging from American Indian militants to seasoned ' 60s radicals and at least one British Labor M.P .
