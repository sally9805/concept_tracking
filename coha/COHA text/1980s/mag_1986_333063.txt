" The suspense of this momentous occasion has been killing me , " confessed Prince Charles , as he addressed a crowd of 18,000 last week after waiting through 105 minutes of learned perorations celebrating Harvard University 's 350th anniversary . Not that H.R.H. had any reason to worry . No stranger to pomp and circumstance , Charles ( B.A. , Cambridge , 1970 ) was resplendent in his academic gown . He scored high marks with self-deprecating quips ( " Have no fear , ladies and gentlemen . I am used to being regarded as an anachronism " ) and a serious speech , which he wrote himself , on the dangers of allowing the teaching of technology to supersede humanistic values ( " A good man , as the Greeks would say , is a nobler work than a good technologist " ) . The American Cantabrigians were duly charmed , and while Charles went on to the rest of his brief , sans-Di U.S. visit , they resumed their four-day-long birthday party .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
