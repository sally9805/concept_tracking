txt // Schaefer-Sim-neru , visual conceptions evolve front simple to Inure complex forms of organization . Each phase of ' development is the preparation for the manifestations of the next stage ; thus there is an inherent principle of natural growth underlying the developmental sequence observed both in the development of the child 's capacity to draw and in art history . Rudolph Arnheim ( 1954/1974 ) extended the work of Gustav Britsch and Henry Schaefer-Simmern and elaborated the natural , logical sequences in the development of art from the perception of simple patterns to increasingly complex ones . For Arnheim , as Britsch and Schaefer-Simmern , the history of art reflects the struggle to achieve an orderly representation of reality . " Pictorial form grows organically according to definite rules , from the simplest to progressively more complex patterns , in a process of gradual differentiation " ( Arnheim , 1954/1974 , p. 171 ) . Along with Britsch and SchaeferSimmern , Arnheim believes that the sequences and stages in the child 's development of the capacity to draw clarifies sequences in the history of art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cultural development is more concerned with generalities than specifics , drawing a simple overall image . Initially simple and isolated , the image becomes more complex and aggregate . The pictorial forms proceed from a horizontal and vertical orientation to an inclusion of the oblique , from a simple and isolated figure to the complex and aggregate . Straight lines become right angles , providing symmetry and defining relationships between directions . The right angle is the basis for the articulation of the horizontal and vertical . All angular directions are represented initially by the right angle until obliquenes is mastered . Obliqueness creates a dynamic image because it is perceived as a deviation from the invariant dimensions of horizontal and vertical . When combined with the horizontal and vertical , obliqueness provides the third dimension of space and becomes the basis for the representation of three-dimensionality . The ability to represent volume is a late development . In children 's drawings , there is a gradual development from a primordial ball , to the one-dimensional stick , to the gradual differentiation of flat from cubic bodies , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depth proceeds from an initial representation of each view considered in isolation in horizontal stripes , one on top of the other , to an overlapping in which there is a three-dimensional stackThe // Mg , to an integration of ' the entire picture plane from front to back and side to side . Eventually , various views are integrated into a single , cohesive , continuous space . Arnheim , like Gombrich , considers the figure ? ground relationship a basic dimension in perception . Figure ? ground contours define flat two-dimensional space parallel to the frontal plane . This can give the appearance of objects at different levels of depth ? usually , however , at only two levels . Thus , figure ? ground relationships are a fundamental perceptual factor in defining levels of depth . The negative space between figures is important not only in defining the relationship between the figures but also in establishing depth . Development proceeds from the figure ? ground relationship , to a " stacking of frontal visual objects , " to overlapping and superimposition , to transparency , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to the creation of depth , volume , and threedimensionality ( Arnheim , 1954/1974 , p. 245 ) . Depth is facilitated further by the use of gradients of size , texture , shape , sharpness , and dimensions of color such as brightness , saturation , and hue . Arnheim ( 1954/1974 , p. 283 ) , however , in contrast to Gombrich ( 1960 ) , finds it paradoxical that it took so long in the history of civilization to develop perspective , since the method is suggested " most naturally to everyone by the evidence of visual experience . " The three dimensions of space define the shape and location of objects in relation to each other . At first , space is limited to a linear track , without specification of shape . Two-dimensional concepts provide limited extension into space , with a restricted capacity to create varieties of shapes and sizes and differences in direction , orientation , and placement . Eventually , in three-dimensional space , shapes can have extent , direction , and a freedom of position . The representation of changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dimension of time to the three dimensions of space . According to Arnheim ( 1954/1974 , p. 218 ) extension beyond the three dimensions of space can be achieved only by " intellectual construction " since visual imagery is insufficient . Based on Gestalt perceptual theory , Arnheim discusses the child 's development of the capacity to draw as the development or the recasting of schemata in which there is a correspondence between the progressive differentiation in the child 's perceptual world and in the child 's drawings . Progress is accomplished by further development of a vocabulary of forms and schemata . Development in the history of // art does not occur simply by drawing what is perceived , but involves instead the development of new schemata . " Though Arnheim stresses the importance of the development of new schemata , he discusses progress in art primarily in terms of concepts of visual perception . Rather than distinguishing between perception and representation , Arnheim ( 1954/1974 ; 1968 ) differentiates the perception of effect from the perception of form and concludes that it is the change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new schemata . Much of Arnheim 's formulation of development in the child and in the history of art is based upon Gestalt perceptual theory . While Arnheim discusses the differences between perception and representation , between recognition and imitation , he , like Gombrich , uses a theory of perception rather than a theory of mental representation as his basic model . Though Arnheim ( 1954/1974 , p. 170 ) does distinguish between the " perception of effect and perception of form , the latter being needed for representation , " he does not elaborate a theory of representation . Instead , he is primarily interested in perceptual processes , in dimensions of visual imagery and " visual thinking " and their role in portraying the three dimensions of ' space . Arnheim utilizes Gestalt perceptual principles ( e.g. , Kohler , 1947 ; Wertheimer , 1945 ) such as perception of good form ( pragnanz ) , figure ? ground contours , and size and shape constancy , but he does not make the leap to integrate the development of visual imagery and perceptual processes into a broader model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954/1974 , p. 218 ) term , " intellectual construction . " Arnheim , like Loewy , Britsch , Schaefer-Simmern , and others ( e.g. , Barnhart , 1942 ; Miljkovitch , 1979 ) , found the study of the child 's development of the capacity to draw particularly useful for studying the development of perceptual processes and applying them to changes in the history of art . But recent formulations of developmental psychological theorists such as Jean Piaget ( e.g. , 1937/1954 ) and others ( e.g. , Werner , 1948 ; Werner &; Kaplan , 1963 ) indicate that while perceptual processes are an important developmental process , they are only part of a more extensive and comprehensive development of intellectual constructions , representations , and symbolic forms . These recent theoretical formulations in developmental psychology can provide a more comprehensive model for understanding // the complex development of modes of representation that have occurred throughout the history of art . A Theory of Mental Representation Piaget ( 1937/1954 ) makes a fundamental distinction between perception and cognition . He defines perception as the process of clear-cut recognition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available stimuli , and he differentiates this from processes that involve constructions , operations , and transformations of absent objects . But perception and representation ( cognition ) are also closely interrelated ; perception provides the basic information for the development of cognition , and cognitive processes in turn enrich and extend perception . Though representation is clearly based on perceptual input , representation goes beyond perceptual processes . Because perception and representation are interrelated , analysis of the development of style in the history of art from a theory of perception would be consistent with insights gained from an analysis based on representational theory , but representational theory provides a broader and more comprehensive theoretical model . Perceptual theory has made important contributions to understanding the development of modes of representation in the history of art , particularly the development of linear perspective ? the process of creating the trompe l'oeil , the highly realistic representation of a three-dimensional reality on a two-dimensional surface , and the representation of the manifest appearance of objects within a unified conception of space . But perceptual theory is insufficient for understanding the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 , p. 2 ) notes that " beyond the range of recognizable and familiar subject matter lay another range of vaster proportions , but of baffling indeterminacy . " As Janson ( 1961 , p. viii ? ix ) comments in his introduction to Bernheimer 's provocative book , The Nature of Representation , abstract works of art , " whether geometric or biomorphic , " are " nonobjective " and " postrepresentational " in that they do not depict " recognizable objects , but they nevertheless refer , however obliquely , to a reality separate from that of the work of art itself . They still create an illusion , an image of some kind , and to that extent retain representational significance . " Janson ( p. ix ) calls for " a framework theory , " a " semantics of the visual arts , " that will provide a basis for art historical analysis . For Bernheimer ( p. 25 ) , a theory of // representation would be applicable to both " reproductive " art and the " higher symbolic phases " and could provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure for all of art . A theory of representation , for example , could provide understanding of the development of modes to represent manifest concrete features , the development of linear perspective , and the establishment of a unified conception of space . But a theory of representation could also provide understanding of the development of the representation of the more abstract , symbolic , internal structure of objects . A theory of representation could encompass both the " optical " and " conceptual " modes of representation and even provide a basis for understanding their interrelationship . A theory of representation allows for an extension of an analysis of the history of art based on perceptual processes of image making and image reading ( Arnheim , 1954/1974 ; Gombrich , 1960 ) to an analysis based on cognitive processes and the construction of symbols . A theory of representation would consider the different nodes of representation throughout the history of art as various expressions of symbol formation . Art historians , such as Gombrich and Arnheim , have used the term representation as an expression for artistic performance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by philosophers ( e.g. , Cassirer , 1955 ) and in genetic epistemology ( e.g. , Piaget 1937/ 1954 ) to refer to a conceptual , imagined , or internal event that lies behind behavior . Representation in philosophy refers to both the content and the structural form of an internal event . In psychology , modes of representation refer to cognitive structures ? the abstract processes that mediate between perception and construction ( Olson , 1970 ) . The development of ' new cognitive structures ( modes of- representation ) is a critical aspect of individual human development and a crucial aspect of the development of culture . The development of these cognitive structures is particularly apparent in the development of modes of representation ( construction ) in the history of art. = The // artist learns how to render nature from tradition ? from established modes of representation that must be extended and revised to create a new style . New styles and new modes of representation in art are grounded in prior modes and are the result of experiments with past and present achievements and motifs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominant in the culture and actively seek alternative interpretations and modes of representation . These revisions , however , are more than a simple rejection or revision of established modes , but involve creative extensions of prior modes of experience and representation . When viewed from this perspective , then , the history of art is a series of experiments to find new modes of representation that facilitate adding a new dimension to the experience of the reality that the artist seeks to communicate . As discussed in Chapter 2 , substantial research has been conducted on the individual 's development of modes of representation and symbolic forms . This research can provide a theoretical model for the understanding of the progressive development of symbolic forms within the history of art , a model external to art itself and with considerable validity and scope in its own right . Application of such a theoretical model allows the successive transformations in artistic representation throughout history to be considered in relation to the broad topic of the development of cognitive processes . The vocabulary of form or the system of schemata sought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optic ( e.g. , Riegl ) or optical to conceptual or schematic to perspective to impressionistic ( Fry , R. E. , cited by Gombrich , 1960 ) , can be considered as part of a general development of symbolic forms . Loewy 's formulation of progress in the history of art as the overcoming of the pressure to retain the memory of the literal object to create the illusion of reality , for example , can be considered as part of the process in which there is a change in symbol formation from concrete , literal representation to those in which there is an integration of objective and subjective dimensions . To study processes of representation in art history as forms of symbol construction shifts the focus from understanding art as an imitation of nature to an emphasis on the symbolic operations and conceptual schemata inherent in artistic representation . It diminishes the need to differentiate between imitation ( perception ) and representation ( construction ) and allows all art to be considered as conceptual . Like language , artistic styles differ in their articulation and in the : 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and types of questions they allow the artist to ask and answer ( Gombrich , 1960 ) . The study of artistic modes of representation as symbolic operations can provide a conceptualization of the grammar of forms and the schemata of representations that could facilitate the study of the longitudinal development of style ( a diachronic analysis ) and the identification of similarities in the symbolic form expressed in the multiple cognitive endeavors of the culture ? in its art , literature , mores , philosophy , religion , science , and social order ( a synchronic analysis ) ( see , e.g. , Peckham , 1965 ; Praz , 1970 ; Ruskin , 1873 ; Schapiro , 1937 ; Sypher , 1955 , 1960 ) . Erwin Panofsky ( 1924/25 ) , in his seminal contribution that considers perspective as " symbolic form , " was among the first to anticipate the importance of a theory of mental representation and symbol formation for understanding the development of style . Panofsky considered both the content and the formal dimensions of art in his formulation of style . In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the intrinsic or symbolic meaning . Apparent meaning is the primary or natural subject matter , the literal meaning of ideas , the stated facts and their interrelationships . Apparent meaning consists of the conventional subject matter , the larger themes and concepts of general cultural and historical knowledge . Yet another level of meaning , according to Panofsky ( 1955b ) , is a synthesis of the apparent meaning of the general cultural context with relevant ideas from other humanistic disciplines . On this level , evidence from other fields is integrated with the ideas expressed in art . The relationship of ideas among related fields is the intrinsic meaning of the subject . Panofsky contrasts the study of the intrinsic meaning of images ( iconology ) with the apparent and cultural meaning of art ( iconography ) . When considering the formal , or structural features of composition , Panofsky ( 1924/25 ) was particularly interested in the development of perspective as a symbolic form that reflected the general cognitive orientation of the Renaissance : Panofsky discussed the development of perspective primarily in terms of the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of artistic or aesthetic merit . He discussed the development of the representation of space as proceeding from a figure in isolation , to space as an aggregate of figures , to space as a comprehensive and coordinated system . According to his theory , the achievement of perspective during the Renaissance was only one exThe // pression of ' the developments in epistemology and science that occurred at this particular moment in history . The development of perspective in art was part of the general repudiation of an Aristotelian world view , in which the cosmos was built around the midpoint of the earth as the absolute center enclosed by outermost spheres of the heavens as an absolute limit . This conception of the universe was replaced by conceptions of infinity , defined both in terms of God and nature . Building upon Panofsky 's formulations , several art historians ( Burnham , 1971 ; Edgerton , 1975 ; Gablik , 1976 ) began to consider modes of representation in art . as a process of the development of symbolic forms and cognitive schemata . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated by Jean Piaget , as a broad theoretical basis for an analysis of the history of art . Burnham ( 1971 ) discusses the importance of concepts of structuralism in the work of Piaget and Levi-Strauss for art historical analysis . Edgerton ( 1975 ) bases his analysis of the development of linear perspective on Piaget 's formulations of the child 's development from an initially egocentric viewpoint to a growing understanding of " space structuration . " Edgerton notes clear parallels between the development of linear perspective from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance and the development of the child in learning to perceive abstract structured visual space and linear perspective ( Ginsburg &; Opper , 1969 ; cited by Edgerton , 1975 ) . In evaluating this developmental process , Edgerton stresses that one should not consider early stages in the history of Western Civilization , such as the medieval European period , as a regression but rather as " qualitatively different " and as " an entity in its own right , " not in contrast to the eventual or current level of function , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation based on Piaget 's formulations , first introduced into an analysis of the history of art by Burnham and subsequently elaborated by Edgerton , received fuller consideration in the work of Gablik ( 1976 ) . Gablik proposes that art , like the history of science , develops and progresses in a continuous , orderly process . She is particularly interested in the development of form in the history of art and how it relates to the structure of mental processes as articulated by Jean Piaget . Gablik considers developmental growth in the history of art as part of an integrated system that expresses an unfolding of structure similar to the laws of development of cognitive processes in the child . Gablik ( 1976 ) agrees // with Piaget that the child 's development of intelligence essentially defines a " genetic epistemology " ? the study of ' the genesis of systems of knowledge in many different areas . The history of art reflects a distinctive cognitive process that has evolved through stages and fundamental transformations to increasingly more complex and logical schemata . Gablik ( p. 12 ) stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development " in the history of art expressed in the " transformations of space and the elements of geometric form : flat planes , deep space , proportion , regularity , symmetry , progression and the structuring of measured relationships . " She discusses how the capacity to represent the human figure as a total volume developed as a continuous process in which new strategies continually emerged and led to a greater synthesis , proceeding from a semi-static , semicontinuous configuration to configurations that are continuous and kinetic . Basing her work on Piaget , Gablik discusses the development of cognitive structures or schemata , and how they provide the basis for the organization of knowledge progressing from relative globality and lack of differentiation to stages of increasing differentiation , articulation , and integration . Gablik delineates three stages in the development of mental schemata and demonstrates a similar sequence in the history of art . First in a preoperational stage the basic mode is enactive and the spatial concepts are topological . This stage is expressed primarily in ancient and medieval art . The second is a stage of concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space are projective and Euclidean . Gablik ( 1976 ) sees this stage of mental schemata as occurring primarily from the Renaissance to the modern period . In the third stage , one of formal operations , the mode is symbolic with an indeterminate concept of space . This stage is expressed primarily in the modern period . For Gablik , the history of art is a slow , laborious liberation of forms from content and a move away from the iconic modes of representation to the expression of formal logical systems dealing with pure abstract relations . Contemporary art moves toward formal operational thought and away from the " grip " of the concrete image . Although she discusses these separate stages , Gablik ( 1976 , p. 46 ) stresses the continuity between them ? " Each stage carries the seeds of the next phase , and each new cognitive structure includes elements of earlier structures but transforms them in such a way as to represent a more stable and extensive // equilibrium . " Spatial conceptions can not be reduced to " pure perception , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but are based on cognitive operations in which eventually there are transformations and coordinations of multiple dimensions in operational thought . Gablik , like Piaget , stresses the difference between perception and representation and notes that perception is literal , direct , and immediate , while representations involve transformation , integration , and coordination of perceptual experiences . Representation thus transcends perception . The mental image of an object is not a simple copy of the object , but rather a mental construction and representation , a series of transformations and operations that organize and integrate perceptual experiences and coordinate different dimensions and aspects of objects . In applying Piaget 's developmental concepts of representation to an analysis of art history , Gablik considers the development of art from classical to contemporary times and demonstrates the shifting and evolving schemata in three major epochs . She discusses extensively the shift from iconic to formal modes of representation and its implications for understanding modern art . The analysis of the history of art to be presented in this book is in the tradition of Panofsky , Bernheimer , Burnham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOCABULARY OF FORM The persistent call in art history for the identification of a " vocabulary of form , " " a system of schemata , " " a matrix or scale of structured relationships " is consistent with the recent attempt in a number of disciplines to define the principles and cognitive structures that underlie all human intellectual endeavors . Structuralists ( e.g. , Chomsky , 1968/1972 ; Jakobson , 1960 ; Lacan , 1977 ; Levi-Strauss , 1963 ; Piaget , 1970b ; Werner and Kaplan , 1963 ) in a variety of different disciplines have sought to identify organizational principles and structures that provide rationality and order for human behavior . This search for the underlying , unverbalized ( unconscious ) order in cognitive endeavors is a quest for the identification of the basic constructs through which individuals understand and organize their universe . Structuralists seek to identify and define the innate ( deep ) // cognitive structures and the rules through which these cognitive structures evolve and are transformed ( Lane , 1970 ) . The interest in inner form and structure rather than manifest form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures that occur in all spheres of human intellectual endeavor . The underlying hierarchical organization of forms , patterns , and structures in general systems ? the innate mechanisms and rules of transformation , the similarities in organization and origin that are below apparently similar or dissimilar surface qualities ( Overton , 1975 ) ? can provide homologies which can be applied to intellectual activity in a diversity of contexts . Basic to the identification of form , configuration , pattern , and structure is the concept of an ordered complexity governed by underlying principles that define the development and transformation of the forms of manifest shape ( Whyte , 1951 ) . The basic relationships of form and their processes of transformation , discussed as " cognitive schemata , " patterns , or gestalts , have been used to understand neurological processes ( Head , 1920 ) , memory ( Bartlett , 1958 ; Paul , 1959 ) , perception ( Koffka , 1935 ; Kohler , 1947 ; Wertheimer , 1945 ) , information processing ( e.g. , Miller , Galanter , &; Pribram , 1960 ) , linguistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 ; de Saussure , 1959 ) , social order ( e.g. , LeviStrauss , 1963 ) , and the development of children ( e.g. , Piaget , 1929/ 1965 , 1970b ; Werner &; Kaplan , 1963 ) . In psychoanalysis , Guttman ( 1973 ) has also discussed concepts of structure in personality organization ( e.g. , id , ego , superego ) as the mechanisms and processes that are relatively stable ( Hartmann , Kris , &; Loewenstein , 1946 ) or develop at a slow rate of change ( Rapaport &; Gill , 1959 ) . The definition of structures in psychoanalysis as the relatively stable organizations of mental functions is consistent with the concept of structure in contemporary theories of art and science . A structural analysis identifies the formal connections that define a system ? the elements in their own right and the relationships and interrelationships among the elements . Guttman ( 1973 ) sees the search for the concept of structure in psychoanalysis and in other areas , such as art and science , as an attempt to understand the cohesive , or organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling them to relate successfully to their environment . Cognitive organization is clearly more than a simple accumulation of individual elements of sense data , but is a function of a coordinated A Structural Analysis of a Vocabulary of Form 4 1 network of patterns determined by structural laws . Modern concepts have moved away from a simple emphasis on individual elements of sense data , to a much higher order of complexity in which elements are placed in a hierarchy of relations and interrelations . Structuralists believe that understanding the patterns of interrelationships is the key to understanding all intellectual endeavors . The understanding of structure and structural principles is more than defining independent parts . It is an understanding of the interconnections and interactions of complex elements in which parts interact with one another within a hierarchy of substructures proceeding from relatively low levels of structure to superordinate structures ( Guttman , 1973 ) . In contrast to outer form , structure is the " form seen inside , as the definitive arrangement , static or changing , of localized parts " ( Whyte , 1965 , p. 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elements and their interrelationships leads to the identification of a variety of levels of interaction within a hierarchy of substructures that continue to interact to form superstructures . The evolution of these organizing structures can be considered in all cognitive endeavors ? in art , literature , mathematics , philosophy , science , and in concepts of time , space , and causality ( Cassirer , 1946 ) . The invariant forms and their rules of transformation are regularities that specify the basic principles of organization and structure . For example , despite the apparent diversity , instability , and disorder of multiple languages , customs , and rituals in a wide range of cultures , structural anthropologists ( Durkheim , 1912/1976 ; Hertz , 1909/ 1973 ; Levi-Strauss , 1963 ; Mauss , 1950/1954 ; Needham , 1973 ) have discussed a set of invariant forms , such as binary opposition ( right ? left , up ? down , etc. ) , and transformational rules that are expressed in kinship patterns , customs , myths , and language of all cultures . They have identified some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of social organization and of the structure of the mind . They have identified " binary opposition " as a fundamental cognitive structure that appears in myth and kinship formations in primitive and civilized societies . The universal tendency to develop dichotomies and to perceive opposites suggested to Needham ( 1973 , p. xxxiii ) that " human beings all over the world tend to order themselves and their environment in remarkably similar ways , and by implicit recourse to classificatory principles so general and adaptive as to appear natural proclivities of the human mind . " In // similar investigations , linguists ( e.g. , Chomskv , Jakobson ) have also sought to identify a set of invariant forms and transformational rules that are the basic syntax of all language . Jakobson and Chomsky identified structural dimensions in linguistics and demonstrated how these structural properties in language are similar to principles in visual perception ( Tynianov &; Jakobson , 1928/1972 ) . Concepts of ' differentiation and integration , binary opposition , structured stages , and developmental progression are present in individual cognitive development and are expressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In their investigations of basic structures in individual development of cognitive processes , Piaget ( 1937/1954 , 1970 ) and other developmental psychologists ( e.g. , Werner &; Kaplan , 1963 ) define a number of levels of cognitive structures ranging from sensorimotor , to preoperational , to intuitive , to concrete and , eventually , to formal , operational thought . These structures organize and direct behavior in an increasingly comprehensive and effective fashion . Although individuals are unaware of these underlying structures , they are the basic coherent principles that determine human behavior and experience . These underlying elements of form ? their relationships and transformations ? are reflected in a multitude of overt forms in individual thought and action , and in the basic structure and organization of society ( Rosenwald , 1975 ) . In a structural analysis , the primary emphasis is upon holistic conceptions in which there are attempts to define the underlying structures , the relation and organization of elements into forms and patterns , and the transformation of these patterns into more complex levels of organization . The formal systems can be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Piaget , 1970b , p. 33 ) . Evolution of structures is a continuous process of transformation and construction . These " operational " structures are transformational and result in higher , more formal systems that allow for the testing of earlier presuppositions and propositions . A higher level of abstraction is needed to test a proposition of an earlier and lower level system ( Godol , 1965 , cited by Piaget , 19701 ) ) . A procedure , or a conceptualization , can not be used to assess its own validity ? one needs an external methodology or a higher order of generality to assess the validity of propositions within a given system . An understanding of the development of structures in one area , for example , could provide an // independent model for studying the development of structures in another area . Structuralism derives in part from Kant and from Cassirer 's neoKantian views , which stress that knowledge of nature is a function of the categories we utilize to organize experiences . Kant and Cassirer were interested in the innate capacities and structures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of a person 's cognitive constructions . Cassirer sought to unify the sciences by articulating the forms and functions of cognition into a universal order . He sought to define the symbolic forms inherent in all human endeavors that allow for the transformation of impressions into a world of knowledge . The problems of representation and the structure of consciousness , specified in various kinds of temporal , spatial , and causal relationships , are central to all symbolic activity . A system of " transcendental logic " enables individuals to construct subjective schemata that organize experience and knowledge . The schemata , in turn , influence the perceptual experiences in both the selection and processing of sensory information into systematic forms of knowledge . Thus , these schemata have an important role in constructing an understanding of nature , and they are expressed in art , literature , and science . Symbolic forms and the development of meaning are creative cognitive constructions that organize and shape understanding of , and interaction with , nature . Time , space , and causality are intuitions and symbolic constructions that order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of available symbolic forms is determined by our sensory apparatus and neurological structures , and the innate conceptual structures already available within the society . The characteristics of our sensory ap- footnote'Structuralism , of course , as a theory and a method , like all intellectual endeavors , reflects the cognitive structure ( episteme ) of our time ? the search for internal structure and organization and for abstract principles . This contemporary emphasis on underlying structure and principles of organization is like the search for subatomic particles , the interest in abstract art , and the emphasis on relativity and a holistic field . Structuralism , as a theoretical model , dominates current modes of investigation in numerous disciplines . Numerous areas search for the stable principles of internal organization that underlie variations of surface manifestations . The entire movement of structuralism is our contemporary mental construction through which we attempt to bring order and organization to our experience . // paratus and neurophysiolugical and psychological processes both facilitate and limit our conception of the universe and determine all our observations , including our scientific concepts and theories . Representations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe , organize , understand , and appreciate nature . The structural organization of these modes of representation evolves over time , both within the individual and in the history of civilization . We continually construct the cognitive schemata we apply to nature . For Kant ( 1871/1929 ) and Cassirer ( 1946 ) , the universe does not have objective properties such as finitude or infinitude . Space is not an inherent dimension of reality that must be learned in experience , but a particular construction of the human mind . Space , time , and causality do not exist as dimensions in external reality that are perceived and learned ; they are constructs imposed on experiences to establish order and organization . They serve as the basis for all understanding and knowledge . The cognitive schemata reflect the various ways experiences are processed , retained , organized , stored , and transformed ( e.g. , Falmagne , 1975 ; Miller , Galanter , &; Pribram , 1960 ; Newell &; Simon , 1972 ) . Predominant cognitive schemata indicate the range of cognitive processes available within a culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way one experiences , knows , remembers , and thinks about the world . The construction of representations is a process of establishing formats for the encoding of information and experiences so they can be retained effectively in memory . Representation , like memory , is an active , constructive process ( Loewald , 1976 ) that bears the stamp of the situation , the individual 's prior experiences , and his level of cognitive development . Modes of representation evolve within the life cycle of the individual and through the history of civilization ( Piaget , 1970b ) . Scientific conceptions of the universe , for example , illustrate how cognitive constructions and representations have evolved over time . And likewise , in the history of art , the modes of representing a threedimensional reality on a two-dimensional surface have become increasingly differentiated , articulated , and integrated . These modes of representation are not inherent in reality . Rather , they are constructions by individuals within a culture through which they attempt to bring organization to their experiences . Piaget ( 1971 ) asserts that his study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic epistemology that can be applied to the study of the development of cognitive stuctures in the history of civilization . According to Piaget , cognitive structures in the history of civilization have evolved through the same major stages of development that he observed in individuals ? stages of **26;216;TOOLONG , intuitive , and concrete and formal operational thought . ' Piaget ( 1970b ) asserts that there is a basic parallelism between the developmental processes in the individual and in the history of civilization . The study of these parallel forms in the individual can provide guidelines for understanding the development of cognitive schemata in cultural history . The fact that the development of cognitive schemata in the history of civilization parallels the development of the individual need not demean or depreciate earlier stages in the history of civilization . Rather , it only implies that people and civilizations learn from each other and , therefore , the forms of cognitive structures early in a developmental sequence will be less differentiated , articulated , integrated , and complex than cognitive structures that occur later . Symbolic constructions evolved developmentally over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in multiple ways in the culture . Panofsky ( 1924/25 ) , for example , discussed how the concepts of infinity , homogeneous space , and linear perspective were all part of the same conceptual structure that began late in the Renaissance and continued through the 17th and 18th centuries and was expressed in a variety of endeavors in art , science , literature , and theology . Impressed with the structural similarity that appears simultaneously in a large number of different disciplines , Foucault ( 1970 ) sought to characterize the nature of cognitive structures in order to construct a theory of scientific change and epistemological causality . He believes that a hidden network determines the way various areas interact ? an inherent inner law or fundamental code of a culture that governs language , schemes of perception , techniques , values , practices , mores . Foucault ( 1970 , p. xxii ) refers to this underlying order as epistemes , in which knowledge is not related to rational value or footnote'Concepts of the deity , for example , early in civilization , were primarily based on concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a personification of the deity into specific individual(s) ; later the concept became more abstract , involving something unseen and unknown , and , even later , a set of formal ideals and principles . // objective forms , but rather to " configurations within the . spare of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science , " ( Foucault 's italics ) . Piaget ( 1970b , p. 132 ) , however , is critical of Foucault for simply defining Kantian " historical apriorities " and conditions for knowledge , without adequately discussing or explaining the sequences in which they occur . Piaget comments that Foucault 's cultural epistemes are described as simply following one another in the course of history , without defining the fundamental principles or the epistemological structures of the period or how these principles relate to those of the periods that precede and follow . Also Foucault fails to define the conditions necessary for the emergence of a new episteme or to evaluate its validity . Piaget ( 1970 , p. 132 ) is also critical of Foucault 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects at the same level " and at the time , without relating this synchronic analysis to the epistemes of other periods , either developmentally or historically . Piaget ( 1970b ) goes on to argue for the importance of a diachronic analysis in the study of cognitive structures because it is only through the subsequent development of " stronger " or more comprehensive structures and systems that the validity of an earlier , more elementary structure ( Godol , 1965 ) can be ascertained . This criticism was actually inherent in the comments of Tynianov and Jakobson a number of years earlier when they noted that the distinction between diachronic and synchronic relationships may be partly illusory because each synchronic system had a past and a future , and these are essential structural elements of the system ? " the history of a system is in turn also a system ... each synchronic system contains its past and future as inseparable structural elements of the system " ( Tynianov &; Jakobson , 1928/1972 , p. 82 ) . Cultural history is often characterized by sudden and thorough reorganizations in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These changes are governed by revisions in the basic cognitive schemata or epistemes of a culture ? the set of unconscious ( unformulated ) j presuppositions about the nature of the universe . Revisions of these presuppositions reflect a fundamental change in the conception of the world and of nature . Kuhn ? ( 1962/ // 1970 ) discusses major shifts in the conceptual structure and rules of discourse in the history of science . These changes involve an entire - onstellation of related ideas in science , art , philosophy , and religion . these " paradigmatic " shifts in conceptual structure occur with a beginning awareness that some aspect of nature has been either ignored or violated in current understanding and representation . The new awareness brings with it a more or less extended exploration to correct the anomaly or inconsistency . Exploration ends when there is a paradigmatic shift in cognitive structure that , for the time , resolves the problems and inconsistencies . Subsequent research attempts to articulate the paradigm , examine its implications , and increase its precision until another inconsistency or anomaly is noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another universally recognized reorganization and the cycle repeats itself . Thus , theories in science do not develop through gradual , steady accumulation of individual discoveries and inventions , but by drastic shiftsrevolutions ? that alter the currently acceptable conceptualizations as well as the historical perspective of scientists regarding past accomplishments . The scientific revolution produces a shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and transforms the very nature of scientific inquiry . There is a reconstruction of prior theory , " an intrinsically revolutionary process that is seldom completed by a single man and never overnight " ( Kuhn , 1962/1970 , p. 7 ) . Paradigmatic shifts are " non-cumulative developmental episodes in which an older paradigm is replaced in whole or in part by an incompatible new one " ( Kuhn , 1962/1970 , p. 92 ) . These scientific revolutions are initiated by the growing awareness that an existing paradigm is no longer adequate for explaining and facilitating the exploration of nature . Successive stages in the developmental process are marked by significant shifts in t lie definition of both potential problems and possible solutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanently fixed scientific truth ( Kuhn , 1962/1970 ) .6 According to Kuhn , the succession of tradition-bound periods punctuated by discontinuous , noncumulative breaks describes not only scientific development but also the history of literature , music , // art , and political development . The history of Western Civilization is often separated into major epochs and periods iii terms of revolutionary stylistic revisions . Difficulties in the conceptualization of style in the history of art could be resolved if the development of painting could be seen in terms of paradigmatic shifts rather than abstract canons of style . Major figures in the history of art , such as Michelangelo , Leonardo , Rembrandt , and Cezanne , invented solutions for inconsistencies and anomalies they sensed in the existing modes of representation . Their revisions of the modes of representation , much like the contributions of Aristotle , Copernicus , Newton , and Einstein in science , constitute paradigmatic shifts ? revolutions in the history of art . Continuity and change in art , like in science , can be understood and conceptualized by examining the major developments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aesthetic expression of the symbolic system of a culture , and as such it is an integral part of the culture 's predominant mode of representation ? its contemporary conceptual and symbolic construction . The procedures artists invent for representing aspects of nature on a two-dimensional surface are expressions of the particular conception and organization of reality available within the society . When a new conception or level of representation is implicit within the culture , artists develop procedures for representing that conception of reality . Conversely , pressure for stability within a culture discourages the exploration of new modes of conceptualization and representation in all cognitive endeavors including art . Thus changes in modes of representation occur at a variable rate , but when changes do occur they follow a logical developmental sequence . These symbolic systems are transmitted from one culture to another and they evolve and develop as extensions of the accomplishments of prior cultures . But the artistic style of each culture expresses the culture 's predominant symbolic conception of reality and the universe . As Clark ( 1969 ) has asserted , artists have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and shape of the universe . Cognitive structures evolve in open systems such as in subject ? object and social interactions . Individuals as well as cultures establish and revise levels of cognitive schemata when inconsistencies and anomalies are encountered . The anomalies are expressions of an egocentrism and the process of " decentration " from this egocentricity is the " generator " of new structures ( Piaget , 1970b , p. 66 ) . DecentraA // tion involves establishing new coordinations and reciprocal relationships that resolve prior inconsistencies and anomalies ( Olson , 1970 ) . Fot Piaget ( 1970b ) , the construction of new cognitive structures is an unending process that proceeds by reflective abstraction from one structure to a higher , more comprehensive structure . Since structures are open systems of operational transformations , there can always be a more encompassing structure . Thus , the ascertaining of the ultimate structure of all structures is an unobtainable ideal . Mental constructions or cognitive schemata are attempts to organize the individual 's personal relationships with reality ( Bion , cited by I lone , 1966 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the culture and they are transmitted and expressed in multiple ways in the basic fabric of the culture , including its child-rearing practices . They are transmitted to the child in an interpersonal matrix , in the relationship between a child and its caring agents , and in the child 's relationship to its culture at large ( Blatt , 1974 ; Parsons &; Bales , 1955 ; Vygotsky , 1962 ) . Vygotsky ( 1962 ) discusses the ontogenesis of regulatory processes , of all specifically mediated human mental processes , and how they arise only in the course of social interaction ? in the process of cooperation and social intercourse . Psychological functions are at first shared between two people , in particular between a child and an adult , and later become the internalized psychological processes of one person ( usually the hild , but not exclusively so ) . Thus , cognitive structures are present in external social activity and are internalized by the child as the structures of mental processes . The development of language is an example of the child 's progressive internalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous theoretical perspectives , the social or interpersonal interaction between caretaking agents and the child provides the basic experience necessary for the establishment of mental structures . Structuralists ( e.g. , Lacan , 1968 ; Levi-Strauss , 1963 ; Piaget , 1937/1954 , 1970b ) stress the importance of object relationships ? the intimate experience of the other ? as essential for the development of all human cognition and mental activity . The child acquires these basic cognitive structures in direct interpersonal relationships ; structures are transmitted through language , custom , ritual , and knowledge within the culture . The development of these basic cognitive structures ( schemata ) , however , can be acquired by the child only to the highest level of cognitive structures available within the society . Members of the society can // utilize cognitive structures only as far as they have been articulated and evolved within the society . With the discovery of new knowledge or with a change in social conditions , the society may establish a new level of cognitive schemata , which will then be transmitted through the interpersonal , parent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive structures of the culture facilitate the understanding of reality , they also place limits on the capacity of the human mind to make finer differentiations and more complex integrations . While individuals possess the inherent potential to develop more complex , integrated and abstract cognitive structures , the development of new cognitive structures is dependent upon their being articulated initially within the culture at large . Recent cross-cultural research by Abel ( 1981 ) indicates that there are major cultural constraints placed upon the cognitive structures available to individuals within that culture . Abel studied the cognitive processes of Navajo and Pueblo Indian adolescent boys and girls who were 16 to 18 years old , of at least average intelligence , and enrolled in a Catholic high school . Abel 's data clearly indicate that utilization of cognitive schemata is determined by cultural traditions and not by capacities or potential of the individual . Navajo and Pueblo native art is flat and two-dimensional . In studying Indian adolescents , Abel found that when they were working with the two-dimensional mosaics of the Lowenfeld Mosaics Test , they made designs primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols , a hogan ( a native hut ) , rug designs ( Navajo ) , or implements of importance in the Pueblos and Indian reservations such as a truck . When working with threedimensional geometric forms of the Lowenfeld Kleidoblocs Test ( e.g. , cubes , rectangles , rods , and arcs ) , the Indian adolescents made themes primarily from the urban , non-Indian culture such as apartment complexes , shopping centers , oil derricks , " houses of the future . " The data indicate that while these children were capable of three-dimensional representations and constructions , items from the Indian culture were represented only in the culturally determined and approved two-dimensional structure . Thus , the utilization of particular cognitive schemata appears to be determined primarily by cultural tradition rather than individual capacities . These findings are consistent with earlier reports by Segull , Campbell , and Herskovitz ( 1963 ) and Scribner ( 1974 ) that suggest that cultural and environmental factors strongly influence learned visual habits . New and advanced cognitive structures are articulated in paradigmatic shifts . When these cognitive structures are consolidated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then can be transmitted to the developing child . Earlier phases of the child 's development reflect less developed forms of the culture 's cognitive structures , while the most advanced cognitive structures of the culture are internalized as a general mode of thought by the most able members of the culture . And it is this group of individuals who possess the potential to revise the current cognitive schemata for the culture 's next paradigmatic shift in cognitive structure . Adolescents and young adults in a society often provide the impetus for change and revision of the current , established modes of thought . Creative and talented adolescents are often those members of the society who have usually adequately internalized the cultural values and the contemporary cognitive schemata of ' the society , but are still sufficiently open and uncommitted so that they can recognize anomalies and inconsistencies and consider revisions of contemporary social norms and modes of thought . This capacity to consider revisions of the basic cognitive structures of a society is the most mature and creative expression of the more general task in which adolescents seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still retaining ties to their c ultural heritage . On an individual basis with their families , as well as on a cultural level , adolescents and young adults seek to revise , modify , and refine contemporary values and modes of thought . For this revision to be effective it must maintain , to some degree , a continuity with the past . It is this process of modification , revision , and extension of contemporary schemata that makes cultural development a progressive process with a developmental history . Obviously , we can not anticipate the next level of cognitive development until it is expressed within the cultural matrix . Once it has been articulated within the cultural context , it is communicated to the members of that culture as a new form of cognitive schemata . Thus we possess both the collective inheritance and current cognitive limitations of our culture . Every individual participates in the " cultural collective consciousness , " but the " profound collective passage " of individuals in the development of this collective consciousness is " beyond our comprehension " ( Huyghe , 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of cognitive schemata , however , may provide some guideposts to an understanding of how this process has evolved iii the past . The child 's evolving conception of reality provides a model through which we can more fully understand the formal and structural dimensions of attempts to render experiences of nature onto a two52 1 . Objects and Spare in the History of Art dimensional surface . It should be stressed , however , that this is a model of the development of the formal or structural aspects of ' the concept of the object and of space . These structures , rather than content , can contribute to establishing a basis for articulating a language and grammar of forms , the matrix or system of schemata , which many art historians consider necessary for a systematic evaluation of the modes of representation in the history of art . The child 's evolving capacity to construct mental representations of the world , particularly its spatiotemporal dimensions , provides a model that can facilitate further understanding of developments in the history of art . In both the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from concrete , literal depictions of the most dis tinctive , manifest features of objects and events , to more subjective representations of reality based on foreshortening , perspective , and subtleties of nuances of color and shading to express affect and feeling ; to representations of nature that are abstract and express the underlying , internal structure of a flexible , mobile universe in unending flux . Hauser ( 1953/1959 ) , Friedlaender ( 1958 ) , and Giedion ( 1941/1967 , 1962 ) , discuss the importance of changes in the representation of the form of objects and of space for understanding developments in the history of art . Friedlaender , for example ( 1958 , p. 8 ) , comments on " the struggle between the picture surface and the presentation of depth in space which is of such vital importance throughout the whole history of art . " For Giedion ( 1962 ) , the all-embracing quality of art is the experience of space . All artistic utterances reflect spatial conceptions and thereby conceptions of the world and nature . Space , for Giedion , portrays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period provides . . . an insight into its attitudes toward the cosmos , mankind , and external values . . . . These attitudes toward space change continually , sometimes in very small degree , sometimes basically . But there have been very few space conceptions throughout the whole development of man . Each has covered long periods of time . Within each of these epochs , however , many variations and transitions have occurred ; for man 's attitude toward space , always in a state of suspension , can shift almost infinitely within the framework of the overriding concept . ( p. 516 ) Probably the most extensive and eloquent statement about the importance of the representation of space in the history of art has been // the work of'Henri Focillon who discussed at length the life of forms in the representation of objects and of space . For Focillon , the mind seeks to create forms out of its experiences in nature , inventing new forms by revising and extending prior forms . Focillon ( 1934/1948 ) is convinced that it is possible , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method " based on the tendency of the mind to create new forms . The creation of forms is a basic aspect of human consciousness so that " even at levels far below the zone of definition and clarity , forms , measures , and relationships exist " ( p. 44 ) . Form mediates between individuals and nature ; nature is experienced in and conceived of through form . Focillon believes that a psychology of art requires a definition of " the processes whereby the life of forms in the mind . . . taking natural objects as the point of departure , makes t hem matters of imagination and memory , of sensibility and intellect " ( p. 47 ) . Forms are for Focillon , " the very substances of art ... at the crossroads of psychology and physiology . " They are " the concrete and active forces powerfully at work among the things of matter and space " ( pp. 49-50 ) . Focillon draws a parallel between the world of forms in the artist 's representation of space and matter and the world of forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " differ only in plan or , possibly , in perspective . " The activity of the artist and of the mind is to create a world of forms that are " complex , coherent , and concrete " ( p. 44 ) . Focillon stresses how each of us in our night dreams , daydreams , and memories constructs images and forms of beings and nature in a space of " illusory authenticity " ( p. 45 ) . Artists struggle to use these mental forms " to free themselves from the tyranny of the model " of prior forms , in order to construct new forms . The life of forms " in the mind is simply a preparation for its life in space " ( p. 46 ) . I'he development of forms is guided by a process of " metamorphosis " that " goes forever forward , by its own necessity , toward its own liberty " ( p. 64 ) . While the development of forms may follow a progression , the life of forms is not governed by a strict , flawless , predestined constancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form that can occur at a particular time by nature , by our minds , and by the cultural context , within these broad limitat ions , there is a wealth of alternatives that can be introduced into this order by individual artists . Focillon notes that there is a basic correspondence between certain orders of form which can define the relationship among works within // particular periods . The representation of t he form of objects in space provides the essential point of departure for the classification and definition of works of art and of individuals . " The life of forms establishes an intimate relationship " ( p. 52 ) that can exist between individuals within a culture independent of the extent of their active personal contact . Focillon emphasizes that it is critical to study " the various stages of artistic behavior in the plainest and most intelligible words " ( p. 45 ) , to build a " psychographic method " based on the tendency of the mind to create new forms , and to define the families of forms that characterize particular periods . Art historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms or a vocabulary of schemata to provide a theoretical model for the analyses of changes in the formal structure and composition of painting . A basic hypothesis of this book is that developmental psychology can provide such a theoretical model for art historical analysis ? a theoretical model that has definition and validity external to art itself and therefore can provide an objective metric for the systematic assessment of a wide range of changes in the formal or structural qualities of style . This book will explore the extent that knowledge about individual development of the capacity for mental representations can provide a model for conceptualizing and studying the development of modes of representation of the forms of objects and of space in the art of Western Civilization . As postulated by Werner and Kaplan ( 1963 ) , Brunswik ( 1959 ) and others , there is a formal parallelism between the processes of differentiation and integration observed in individual development and the development of modes of representation in the history of art . In both the individual and the history of art , changes in the modes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior modes of representation . Both in individual and cultural development , appropriate conditions at appropriate moments facilitate development of new modes of representation while untoward social conditions can produce a reversion in modes of representation . The development of modes of representation in art is an integral part of the society , and major factors can facilitate or impede the development of representations . Art is defined by a cultural norm and standard , and the artist who attempts to change the content and form of the prevailing modes of representation is , to some degree , violating the standards of the culture . Since there may be social sanctions and prohibitions against major revisions of the modes of repreA // sentation , each step in the sequence of development often has to maintain vestiges of ' prior modes of representation . Artists who contribute to major revisions in modes of representation must resist the societal pressures to maintain stability ( Riegl , Hauser ) and must find support for their creative endeavors both within themselves and in segments of the society . Significant changes in modes of representation occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inadequacy of prevailing modes of representation because they , and the society , have the psychological freedom to consider revisions and can struggle to achieve a new mode of representation . While the manifest content of art is determined by the preoccupations of each epoch and by the personality characteristics and interests of the individual artist , the structure of the composition is determined primarily by t he level of structural organization . It is this structural organization that must change if a new mode of representation is to be achieved . Creativity in art is an expression of individual spirit as well as a simultaneous expression of the basic cultural context in which the artist lives ( Huyghe , 1974 ) . A psychological theory of the individual 's development of mental representations allows us to articulate major dimensions of the underlying structural organization of visual art and the sequence through which these dimensions have evolved . A developmental psychological model enables us to systematically assess the relative contributions of different artists in different epochs to the development of modes of representation in the history of art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of cognitive processes is the understanding of the development of modes of representation , especially the construction of the concept of the object and the concept of space . Developmental psychologists ( e.g. , Piaget and Werner ) have described cognitive processes as developing through five fundamental levels of organization : sensorimotor , preoperational , intuitive , concrete operations , and formal operations . Cognitive functions , including the development of the concept of the object , space , time , and causality , all proceed through these five basic levels . From this basic theoretical model of cognitive development , Piaget and his colleagues have articulated three types of spatial concepts : topological , projective , and Euclidean . At the earliest levels of cognitive organization ( sensorimotor , preoperational , and intuitive ) the concept of space is primarily topological and involves an emphasis on features such as proximity , boundary , contour , and surround . More advanced levels of cognitive organization ( concrete and formal operations ) , beginning around the age of seven , are associated with the development of projective and Euclidean concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three basic spatial dimensions of above ? below , right ? left and be-56 // lore ? behind . While Piaget and lnhelder ( 1948 , 1967 ) have discussed at length the development of topological , projective , and Euclidean oncepts of space , contemporary physics and mathematics alert us to an even more advanced level of spatial concepts : a relativistic fourdimensional , spatiotemporal field as articulated in the contributions of Bernhard Riemann and Albert Einstein . Riemannian concepts of space serve to integrate and extend projective and Euclidean concepts of space . This chapter presents a theoretical model of cognitive development , primarily the development of modes of representing concepts of the object and of space , derived from the formulations of dean Piaget and his colleague Barbel Inhelder , and Heinz Werner and his colleague Bernard Kaplan . Subsequent research and formulations in these areas by David Olson ( 1970 ) , Jean-Marie Dolle ( 1973 , 1974 , 1975 ) , Melvin Feffer ( 1959 , 1967 ) , Howard Gardner ( 1972 ) , and Monique Laurendeau and Adrien Pinard ( 1962 , 1970 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaget and Werner . Some of the basic assumptions of this developmental model include the distinction between perception and representation , assimilation and accommodation as processes of internalization and equilibration , and their role in the development of concepts of the object and of space . The study of the development of modes of representation by developmental psychologists , particularly Jean Piaget , has been based primarily on the study of children as they interact with inanimate objects ( e.g. , toys ) in relatively neutral conditions ( Wolff , 1967 ) . Investigators of developmental processes from a psychoanalytic orientation ( e.g. , A. Freud , 1965 ; Jacobson , 1964 ; and Mahler , 1968 ) have also studied the child 's development of the concept of the object , but primarily as it evolves within an interpersonal matrix and particularly under different states of arousal . Psychoanalytic investigators have been particularly interested in the integration of affective and cognitive experiences in the development of the concept of the person including the concept of the other as well as of the self . The integration of the formulations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes affect ive as well as cognitive development and the central role that reflect ive self-awareness has in developmental processes , particularly in the phase of concrete operations and the development of projective concepts of space . // THE DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL According to cognitive developmental psychology and psychoanalytic theory , the individual , throughout psychological development , constructs increasingly differentiated and integrated cognitive schemata . Increasingly complex principles of cognitive organization enable the individual to become more effective in coping with the complexities of reality . Cognitive structures are maintained until the individual becomes aware of further complexities of the environment ? when current cognitive structures are no longer experienced as being fully effective . The individual attempts to accommodate to inconsistencies and inadequacies ( perturbations ) experienced in understanding reality . Subsequent levels of cognitive organization are developed in an attempt to resolve the contradictions inherent in less differentiated and integrated schemata . Cognitive structures change as the individual attempts to achieve more penetrating and effective understanding . When an individual encounters inconsistencies or contradictions between his modes of organizing experiences and the inherent nature of reality , he seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The individual then uses this new level of cognitive organization until subsequent contradictions are experienced and the process repeats itself once again ( Piaget , 1927/1930 , 1950 , 1937/1954 , 1968 ) . There is a constant transaction between increasingly differentiated behavior patterns and increasingly complex levels of cognitive organization . A dialectic exists between the individual and the environment ; the relationship between the individual and the environment changes as a function of this interaction , and initial forms of cognitive organization are reintegrated into higher ones . Lower levels of cognitive organization are relatively unarticulated , global , lacking in differentiation and integration , and are , therefore , relatively unstable . Higher levels of organization have greater stability . Cognitive development at the early stages proceeds relatively rapidly , while in later stages , progression and development are somewhat slower . For Piaget ( Piaget , 1956 , 1926/1963 , 1968 ; Piaget &; Inhelder , 1966/1971 ) knowledge is gained through the process of assimilation and accommodation ( integration ) , in which , through a series of transformations , knowledge about reality becomes part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is acquired through the internalization of the results ( i.e. , information ) of action and the development of operational sequences , // rather than through a more differentiated perceptual registration of reality . Werner ( 1948 ) and Werner and Kaplan ( 1963 ) also discuss the developmental progression of " genetic levels " of increasing differentiation and integration . Diffuse , global , fragmented , concrete , and unstable levels of organization become increasingly articulated , integrated , abstract , flexible , and stable . Higher levels of organization modify and integrate , rather than simply supersede , prior levels . Modes of representation proceed through normal increments in structure and organization from an initial reflexive ( sensorimotor ) level to a more reactive ( perceptual registration ) and eventually to a reflective ( conceptual ) level . Thus , there is a developmental progression from sensorimotor action , to perception , to conceptual levels of organization . An initial fusion of doing and perceiving is subsequently integrated into a concrete conception of " objective " objects in reality and eventually integrated into symbolic processes in which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signified object , the symbolic referent or signifier , and the symbolizing agent ( the self ) . In contrast to Piaget and his colleagues , who have studied cognitive development in children as they respond primarily to inanimate objects , usually while the children are in states of relative comfort and quiescence , psychoanalytic investigators ( e.g. , Anna Freud , Edith Jacobson , Selma Fraiberg , Sybil Escalona , Theresa Gouin Decarie , Margaret Mahler ) have considered the complex interplay between the child 's affective and cognitive development , primarily in interpersonal contexts and in states of affective intensity , such as pleasure , hunger , fear , or general discomfort . According to psychoanalytic theory , the primary factors in cognitive growth and development are the interactions between the child and significant people in the environment around need-gratifying experiences . In the basic caring relationship , the child learns to make significant differentiations within the environment and to integrate these differentiations into increasingly more complex conceptions of the universe . Contemporary psychoanalytic theory ( e.g. , A. Freud , 1965 ; Jacobson , 1964 ; Mahler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the mother ? child interaction , particularly around issues of pleasure and pain , as providing the most important experiences for cognitive growth and development . Just as experiences and information about reality from interaction with inanimate objects become internalized as cognitive structures // ( Piaget , 1937/1954 ) , so do experiences and in f urinal u ) n from interpersonal transactions become internalized as cognitive structures . These cognitive structures develop sequentially and achieve stability or equilibrium at different levels of organization ( Blatt , 1974 ; Fraiberg , 1969 ; Jacobson , 1964 ; Mahler , 1968 ; Mahler et al . 1975 ) . Each stage of cognitive development has particular characteristics of thought that become relatively stable and well structured . The principles of cognitive organization achieved at each of the major developmental stages serve to organize , guide , and direct behavior in both interpersonal and impersonal situations . Thus , cognitive development evolves in the child 's interactions with the animate and inanimate world , and the cognitive structures that are established as a result of these interactions are then utilized subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by the research of Ainsworth ( 1967 ) , Bell ( 1970 ) , Clarke-Stewart ( 1973 ) , and Decarie ( 1965 ) , the development of the concepts of the person and of the inanimate object are interrelated and develop simultaneously . The various levels of cognitive development are expressed in concepts of people , including the self , and inanimate objects , as well as in more general concepts about the structure of nature such as space , time , and causality . Piaget ( 1961/1969b ) makes a fundamental distinction between perception and intelligence ( i.e. , cognitive processes ) . In innate perception there is an immediate , clear-cut recognition and simple reading of " figurative aspects " of a stimulus field , while intelligence ( cognition ) involves cognitive operations such as construction , deduction , and transformation . Transformation includes operations such as order , combination , generalization , synthesis , and integration of components of objects and their actions . Piaget , like Cassirer ( 1955 ) , considers many aspects of perception a basic , primary , innate , and immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken down into different elements . But perception soon becomes integrated with cognition and they become a unified cognitiveperceptual process . Knowledge is gained in symbolic systems not immediately given in innate perception . Concepts are not copies of immediate , sensory material but are symbolic systems based only partially on concrete , perceptual data . Percepts occur in the presence of a physical stimulus , whereas cognition involves a mental image ( a representation ) in the absence of the object . The mental image is constructed on a different level than its corresponding percept ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1966/1971 ) . // Piaget ( 1937/1954 , 1927/1962a , 1961/19696 ; Piaget &; Inhelder , 19,18/1967 , 1969 , 1966/1971 ) maintains a fundamental distinction between perception ( figurative aspects ) and intelligence ( operative and constructive aspects ) throughout all levels of development . The figurative aspects of knowledge are the effects of perceptual centering , while the operative aspects of knowledge , ranging from rudimentary , sensorimotor , prerepresentational activity , to complex and formal levels of operational thought , are the effects of actions or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object . According to Piaget , cognitive structures develop out of a functional and reciprocal interaction between perception and intellectual operations . Perception provides the basic information for intellectual operations , and in turn , cognitive operations enrich and extend the flexibility of perception . Even though perception and intellectual operations are related and develop in a complementary fashion , they are also distinctly different aspects of a knowledge of reality ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 ) . ' Imitation and play make important contributions to the development of cognitive processes , ranging from sensorimotor activities to the development of representations . Both involve the introduction of symbols and the coordination of a signifier for a // signified object . In the early stages of imitation , the child mimics either immediate movements or sounds or those based on a memory of an actual recent event . In this process , the external model has been replaced by an internal one ( Werner , 1948 ; Werner &; Kaplan , 1963 ) . The sensorimotor schemata , the ways in which the infant reacts to an object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object that indicate the development of symbolic activity ( Piaget , 1945/1962b ) . Play provides the opportunity to develop different meanings for the symbolic representation of the absent object . In this process there is an increasing coordination of signifiers for the signified , absent object . Initially , in the sensorimotor stage , the signifier is a signal that is part of the action sequence ; later , the signifier is a static image ? a sign derived from a concrete , perceptual totality ? and , with the development of operational thought , the signifier becomes more abstract and symbolic . Each of the stages in the internalization of action ( or information gained from performatory acts ) corresponds to a stage in the development of the image . There is continual development and transformation of the signifier ( i.e. , the image ) and the signified ( i.e. , the information and the operations abstracted from actions performed on the object ) . Objects come to exist independently of the subject and the subject 's action , and this independent existence is revealed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partitive addition , conservation , seriation , transitivity , etc. ) that can be performed on the concept of the object . The image of the object is , however , only a way-station in the coming to know an object . Images develop through a continued assimilation of external factors , but images are an intermediate stage between perception and repre sentation ( mental construction ) . Although the image is essential as a symbol , it is only part of the conceptual relationship . Initially , the concept of the object is based solely on brief , irreversible , memory images of previously performed actions ( reproductive images ) ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1966/1971 ) . There are two major points in the development of images : at the end of the sensorimotor stage with the formation of reproductive images and , again , at the beginning of concrete operations with the emergence of anticipatory and transformational images . Images at the end of the sensorimotor period are essentially static , while anticipatory and transformational images evolve from causal ( transformational ) reactions and are involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // nervation . As the actions that the child recalls become more complex and as these actions begin to be coordinated , thought becomes increasingly independent of the image . Though the image continues to function as an " essential auxiliary , " it is replaced to a considerable degree by the coordination of action in transformational schemata . At the stage of concrete operations , and , later , at the stage of formal operations , thought is becoming sufficiently logical and precise , that isolated images play an increasingly subordinate role and are replaced by coordinated sign systems of images , language , and symbolic relationships . Thus , the image performs a different function at the various developmental levels . In the later stages of development , the image acts as an auxiliary symbol in which , for example , an entire class may be envisioned by the image of one of the members of the class ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1966/1971 ) . Stages of Cognitive Development According to Piaget ( 1937/1954 , 1962a ) and Werner ( 1948 ) , cognitive schemata develop through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first level of cognitive schemata is achieved at the end of the sensorimotor stage ( at approximately eighteen months of age ) ; higher and more complex levels of cognitive schemata are achieved in subsequent developmental sequences ( at preoperational , intuitive , and concrete and formal operational levels ) . At each developmental level , cognitive schemata are revised ; each of these revisions achieves stabilization ( " equilibration " ) in the establishment of a new level of cognitive schemata ( Piaget , 1977 ) . In " vertical decalage , " cognitive schemata are extended and reorganized at successive levels of development . According to Piaget ( 1954 , 1962a ) , the development of cognitive schemata is an actual constructive deduction that integrates current experiences with earlier cognitive schemata so that current experiences are understood in greater and fuller form . The development of cognitive schemata progresses to increasingly stable , cognitive structures that have greater stability , generality , flexibility , constancy , and complexity . Sensorimotor Level . The forms of cognitive organization are established from early childhood on through adulthood . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through approximately one and a half years of age , in a sensorimotor stage in // which the child knows the world primarily in terms of Immediate actions focused primarily around sequences of ' need gratification . The object is known only through its actions ( Elkiml , 1974 ) and primarily those actions that provide the child with experiences of pleasure and pain . The child is unable to differentiate and coordinate a number of different aspects or dimensions and consequently focuses on only one gesture at a time . Thus , the child is inordinately influenced by particularly vivid single elements in the environment . At this early stage , the child does not appreciate the totality of a situation and the interrelationships among the different parts and features . Piaget ( 1954 ) distinguishes several phases in sensorimotor development that lead to an initial grasp of the permanent existence of external objects . Initially , the child has no concept of himself or of others ; he is aware only of action sequences and sensations and does not differentiate objects from the action sequences . When an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the object was last seen . Subsequently , the infant extrapolates beyond his immediate experience and seeks to maintain contact with the object by following and anticipating the movement of the object . The infant searches for a lost object rather than immediately giving up . But the search is still an extension of the action sequence and not a conception of the object as a separate entity . The search for an object becomes more extensive in subsequent phases in sensorimotor development ; for example , the child will search for an object observed being hidden behind a screen . While the child 's conception of the object is still dependent on the action sequence in this stage , the concept of the object is becoming increasingly independent of the action sequence . The child is first able to infer visible , and later invisible , displacements behind a screen . With the capacity to infer invisible displacements , the child has become capable of representation or symbolic activity and is able to begin to appreciate that objects have stable and consistent properties and an existence , separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensorimotor stage , the child responds to the action of objects and not to the object as an independent entity . The cognitive schemata at this stage are immediate , direct , and have only minimal permanence . The cognitive schemata link perceptions and movements as if they were " static images " and there is little overall understanding of a total situation . Sensorimotor schemata are // prereprescntational and are based on activity , and ? as stressed in developmental psychoanalytic theory ? this activity occurs initially around sequences of the gratification of sensuous bodily needs and the alleviation of pain and frustration . Experiences of pleasure and pain , hunger and satiety , and apprehensions about annihilation and survival that an infant can experience when feeling abandoned by the need-gratifying object are often central to the definition and experience of the object during this early developmental phase . The cognitive schemata of the sensorimotor stage form the nuclei for subsequent constructions . Eventually the object is identified independent of its need-gratifying action . The development of symbolic processes begins in this differentiation of the object from its action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specific action sequences and single perceptual features . The child begins to consider objects through their part properties in a specific , fixed context and to have images of previously experienced actions and of objects no longer present in the physical environment . Objects begin to have an existence independent of their actions ; they are experienced as a general , global , perceptual totality with some sense of constancy and permanence beyond the immediate perceptual field and sensory experience . At this preoperational stage , the child has only a general , overall conception of substantial and permanent objects . This conception is relatively fixed , concrete , and literal . According to Piaget ( 1928/1962a , p. 282 ) , the preoperational stage ( extending from the appearance of language to the age of four ) is the " first form of conceptual thought " which , as a result of language , is superimposed on sensorimotor schemata . Initially , words are personal symbols that refer actions , not to objects . Eventually , words take on more general meaning and begin to refer to objects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 ) , gradually there is a shift from the proprioceptive , sensorimotor experience to cognitive schemata that merely signify the object by images and semi-individual verbal expressions . These cognitive schemata are representations of only momentary situations and partial elements and lack conservation and constancy beyond the immediate perceptual field . The representation of the object is relatively fixed , concrete and literal , and there is little capacity to tolerate transformations of the object or changes in the context and still maintain the identity and definition of the object . These cognitive schemata are not expressions of general // classes or relations , but are simple correspondences between pail 's or small sets of objects that still lack a differentiated conception of ' the total object and its relationship to the context ( Piaget &; Infielder , 1969 ) . Intuitive Level . The preoperational or preconceptual stage is followed by a stage of intuitive cognitive schemata ( ages four to seven ) that serve as a transition to the stages of conceptual operations . In this intermediate , intuitive phase , the static and fragmentary schemata formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intuitive stage , the child moves beyond the simple , semi-individual , cognitive schemata and begins to construct cognitive schemata of the object within a total situation or global configuration . Cognitive schemata are no longer based on a comparison between part properties or small sets of component features , but rather the schemata begin to integrate an entire series of part properties into a total configuration . At this time , mental representations and the concept of the object are primarily reproductive images . The object is represented as a concrete , fixed , idealized , perceptual totality . The basic organizational principle is external form : the concrete , manifest features of the object as a perceptual totality . The child becomes increasingly aware of the totality and the interrelationships of the isolated , specific , concrete parts of the object ; the concept of the object becomes increasingly coordinated and integrated . Knowledge of part ? whole relationships develops slowly . The representation of part ? whole relationships of the intuitive stage is quite different than the preoccupation with fragmented , isolated part properties during the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , the part is equivalent to the total object . Now , in the intuitive phase , part properties are defined in relation to the total object ; they elaborate and enrich the representation of the object and eventually come to serve as signifiers for the object . The separate part properties are integrated into a total conception of the object that is initially concrete and global but eventually become increasingly diverse , integrated , conceptual , and symbolic . In the intuitive stage , the child becomes increasingly aware of the various complementary dimensions that constitute an object and a situation . There is a coordination of several dimensions , but the cognitive schema are still linked to a particular image and context ; an // operational schemata with a capacity for reversibility and transformation is still lacking . The apprehension of the configuration and part properties of objects leads to the creation of operational schemata in which there are transformations with conservation and reversibility . Initially , in the sensorimotor and preoperational phases ( until the age of four ) , action is recalled concretely and always subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just previously performed becomes the anticipation of potential actions to be performed . Eventually ( beginning around the age of seven ) , several cognitive schemata can be activated for the same object and the resulting schemes can be coordinated into new operations ; several alternative actions can be simultaneously considered in reversible combinations within an operational system . Concrete and Formal Operational Levels . Slowly and intuitively , the child has begun to differentiate a number of complementary dimensions that constitute the object . As the child becomes aware of a number of dimensions and their interrelationships , he or she can begin to manipulate and transform these various dimensions while still being able to maintain the basic identity and definition of the object . The object , for example , is no longer conceived of as a general , undifferentiated perceptual totality , but instead different features and functions or appearances in different contexts can be integrated and the basic identity and definition of the objects still maintained . At first , the more concrete and manifest dimensions of objects are manipulated and transformed . The shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or water can be moved from a tall , thin container to a short , wide one and still be conceived of by the child as the same object or the same amount of water . The child is able to coordinate two or more dimensions ( oil operations ) into a structural whole and through the process of transformation and reversibility is able to establish " conservation " of an object . The concept of the object has permanence and can be represented independent of a particular context and as more than a single , concrete , literal , perceptual totality . With the development of concrete operations , the child 's cognitive schemata include reproductions of movements ( changes in positions ) , transformations ( changes in form ) , and anticipatory schemata of things not previously perceived or experienced . These cognitive schemata are no longer tied to certain global configurations and to // specific and static experiences , but are now concerned with concrete and , later , symbolic transformation . The concept of the object becomes less dependent upon external manifest concrete form and begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , and properties of the object . There is a steady progression from the manifest and concrete to the abstract , from the external to the internal , and eventually to the coordination and integration of these various dimensions . Cognitive development involves a progression from operations automatically applied by the subject to objects , to an awareness and differentiation of properties and operations inherent within the object , to an awareness that one is selecting among and balancing the properties and operations that one applies to objects . The initial differentiation of subject from object leads to an articulation of aspects inherent within the object and the self , and finally to a reflective self-awareness of the relativity of one 's cognitive operations . The elaboration and articulation of aspects inherent within the object , the self , and the operations applied to the object are initially defined in terms of external manifest properties and later in terms of abstract and internal ( structural ) properties . During the stage of concrete operations ( beginning around the age of six or seven ) the child can consider different actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a process of reversibility , maintain a conservation of the basic identity of the object . Concrete operations and transformations are replaced by transformation of more abstract dimensions in a stage of formal operations ( beginning around the age of eleven ) in which the child is able to identify inner meaning and structure , and coordinate and integrate these more abstract dimensions with more manifest and concrete features . The period of concrete operations is an " unfolding of a long , integrated process that may be characterized as a transition from subjective centering in all areas to a decentering that is at once cognitive , social , and moral . This process . . . reproduces and develops on a larger scale at the level of thought what has already taken place on a small scale at the sensori-motor level " ? the representation of an object independent of its immediate , physical presence . The " decentering is based on the general coordination of action , and this permits the formation of operatory systems of transformations and constants or conservations which liberate the representation of reality from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1969 , p. 128 ) . // The child initially is able to establish an individual point of view but egocentrically assumes that it is the only point of view . Subsequently , the child becomes aware of having different points of view at different times , and later recognizes that others may have different points of view . The child is now capable of recognizing and distinguishing that people can each have different points of view and that these are different from his own . In summary , the child 's intellectual development is first based on the nature of the child 's actions upon the world and the degree of coordination of these actions . Early on , the child is able to integrate a set of actual actions to achieve a specific goal and later on the child synthesizes potential actions toward an object . With the capacity to anticipate potential actions , there is the beginning of representational thought . Until this point in development , the child 's representations are reproductions of objects and events previously experienced . Now it is possible to evoke memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs , images , and symbols . With the development of the capacity for evocative memory and anticipation , the child can begin to represent objects and events that are transformations and extensions of objects previously experienced and , eventually , of things not previously experienced or perceived . Different actions can now be coordinated and the child is capable of the cognitive operations of reversibility and conservation in which two operations or dimensions are coordinated . Concrete operations lead to more abstract and formal operations in which operations can be performed upon abstract propositions as well as upon concrete objects . With the development of formal cognitive operations children have access to and the capacity for abstract mathematical reasoning . Piaget states that all knowledge proceeds from an initially inseparable relationship between subject and object . The individual defines objects and develops operations ( e.g. , transformations ) through actions . The operations are based can the child 's actions and the objects affected by these actions . The resultant operations enable the individual to construct an even fuller understanding of the object . There is a formalization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined independently of the action . The coordination of actions and operations is expressed in a multilevel , hierarchically organized series of prelogical and logical cognitive schemata that can , in turn , result in the development of higher order operations . CONCEPTS OF SPACE Piaget maintains a sharp distinction between perception and representation ( intellectual constructions ) and considers representation as the central process in cognitive development . This distinction applies to all aspects of knowledge , and particularly to the development of the representation of space . There has been a great deal of research in the perception of space ( Gibson , 1950 , 1966 ; Ittelson , 1960 ; Koffka , 1935 ; Wapner &; Werner , 1957 ) , but there have been relatively few studies of the representation of space ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 ) . While innate perception undergoes a developmental sequence similar to the development of representation , the developmental processes involved in perception are relatively brief . Innate perceptual processes interact with the development of cognitive schemes and become an integrated cognitive-perceptual process . The innate perception of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves relatively fixed , irreversible structures , whereas the representation of space involves the development of reversible structures based on topological , projective , and Euclidean relationships ( Olson , 1970 ; Piaget , Inhelder &; Szeminska , 1960 ) . Concepts of space are initially undifferentiated and become increasingly structuralized ; they develop from relative globality to increased differentiation and hierarchical integration ( Werner , 1957 ) . Topological relationships of proximity , boundary , separation , enclosure , order , and continuity develop first , and projective and Euclidean relationships derive from them . Spatial knowledge and the representation of space are not based on concrete , perceptual data alone , but involve symbolization in which differentiated spatial features are organized into conceptual systems . " What we call space ' is not an independent object that is mediately represented to us , that presents itself and is to be recognized by certain signs ; rather , it is a particular mode , a peculiar schematism of representation itself " ( Cassirer , 1955 , p. 149 ) . The individual 's representation of physical space is defined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive operations available within the subject and qualities that are inherently part of the object . The representation of space follows the same basic developmental sequence as the development of cognitive processes ? that is , through sensorimotor , preoperational , intuitive , and concrete and formal operational stages . The representation of space in the early stages of cognitive development is relatively static and fixed . It is primarily topological in nature and concerned with qualitative features inherent in an isolated figure . The representation of space in the later stages of ' cognitive development , in the concrete and formal operational levels , is primarily based on projective and Euclidean concepts . The progression from topological concepts of space to projective and Euclidean concepts involves increasingly complex coordination among the three dimensions of space and the development of conceptual systems to express this coordination . Piaget 's formulations of the chi1d 's construction of concepts of space is most fully articulated in the book written in collaboration with Barbel Inhelder ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 ) and subsequently confirmed and elaborated by the research of Monique Laurendeau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inhelder ( 1948/1967 ) , basing their argument on their general theoretical model , discuss the child 's sense of space as proceeding through three levels : a topological , a projective , and a Euclidean level . Topology is based on purely qualitative relations inherent in a particular figure . The primary properties of topological space are proximity , boundary , contour , and separation rather than size , distance , or angularity . Topological concepts are initially limited to the inherent properties of the particular object ( e.g. , figure ? ground ) without the requirement that the object be located in relation to other objects , neither in terms of a particular perspective or point of view ( projective concepts of space ) nor in terms of a system of axes or coordinates ( Euclidean concepts of space ) ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 ) . In the development of perception , the dimension of boundaries , contours , and outlines is a basic process that occurs spontaneously and very early in development . Experimental research in the development of perceptual processes ( Kagan , 1971 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1974 ) indicates that early visual orientation involves scanning at the boundary of figures , where the contours are most vivid . Research with neonates indicates that the response to contour and outline is a very early developmental process . Study of perceptual processes subsequent to the removal of congenital cataracts ( von Senden , 1932 ; cited by Osgood , 1953 ) and considerable developmental research on visual orientation ( Berlyne , 1958 ; Carpenter , Tecce , Stechler , &; Friedman , 1970 ; Fantz , 1963 ; Fantz &; Nevis , 1967 ; Haith , 1966 ; Karmel , 1969 ; Salapatek &; Kessen , 1966 ; Wilcox , 1969 ) and neurophysiology ( Hubel &; Wiesel , 1959 ; Karmel // et al. , 1974 ; Kufflet- , 1952 ) indicate that high contrast of ' edges and boundaries is a primary factor i-i the earliest forms of visual orientation . Likewise , in the development of representation , Piaget ( 1954 ) and Werner ( 1948 ) discuss the first perceptual-cognitive differentiation as the representation of a boundary occurring in an initially undifferentiated field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contour and the boundaries of an object constitute some of the earliest and most basic developmental steps ( Blatt &; Wild , 1976 ) . Piaget and Inhelder consider topological relationships as an essential preliminary step , prior to the development of projective and Euclidean relationships . Topological relationships are primarily qualitative and are concerned with intensity rather than with quantity . Initially , the child has no concept of continuity , only a qualitative sense involving the intrinsic relationships of proximity , separation ( edge ) , order , and simple enclosure in the spatial relations of a single configuration . Figures are defined in terms of separation and contour , with no account of relative dimension , distance , or position in space . Only the inherent properties of the object are considered , based entirely on the relations of boundary or enclosure of elements of a single figure . There is no integrated sense of space and little appreciation of the relations among objects . Rather , the emphasis is primarily upon the homeomorphic relations within the configuration of a single object ? its shape , outline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of depth or of the space between objects . Space is always part of an object and there is no definition of space beyond the inherent relations within a single object . Regardless of how complex it may be , topology is always limited to elements of a single configuration and does not constitute a total space in which several objects are located in relation to one another according to a framework " which takes objective distances and possible points of view into account . . . Piaget conceives of the child 's topological space as a mosaic of fragmentary and distinct spaces whose respective borders are fixed by the continuity of a given perceptual field or by the functional unity of each of the child 's particular experiential fields " ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 , p. 167 ) . In the development of topological space there is a progressive dichotomous " subdivision of the object , first into a few elements , continuous and isomorphic with the whole , then their further subdivisions into points , still finite in number ; and lastly , the subdivision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape nor size " ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 , p. 459 ) . // The relations of proximity , separation , order , enclosure and continuity are built up empirically between the various parts of figures or patterns which they organize . They are independent of any contraction or expansion of these features and are therefore unable to conserve features such as distances , straight lines , angles , etc. during changes of shape . Hence it is impossible for relationships of this type to lead to comprehensive systems linking different figures together by means of perspective or axial co-ordinates , and for this reason they are bound to remain psychologically primitive . This primitive topological space is purely internal to the particular figure whose intrinsic properties it expresses , as opposed to spatial relationships of the kind which enable it to be related to other figures . ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 , p. 153 ) Proximity is a given in topological space and serves as the starting point for the construction of new levels of concepts and operations of topological space . At first , objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later differentiated from other objects . Separation is experienced when two objects have no point in common and is further facilitated as the child develops the concept of surround or boundary ( enclosure ) . Piaget and Inhelder ( 1948/1967 ) discuss three types of enclosures that provide the simple intuitive definition of boundary : a one-dimensional system having a non-dimensional point as it boundary , a two-dimensional system having a one-dimensional line as a boundary , and a three-dimensional system having a twodimensional surface as a boundary . The development from singular to plural dimensional systems leads to groupings that likewise proceed from singular to multiplicative groupings of elements or objects or relationships . The notion of order is constructed from a linear series of elements or enclosures . The concept of continuity develops in a " form intermediate between perceptual and mathematical continuity " ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 , p. 462 ) . At about the age of six or seven , as the child begins to develop concepts of projective space , the whole is broken up into neighboring elements and then reintegrated again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to one another and give rise to the concepts of " extension " and " intention " ( Inhelder &; Piaget , 1955/1958 , 1964 ) . Extensive preoperational groupings refer to the spatial configuration of a series as a whole ? that is , the elements are arranged in a quantitative order such as along the dimension of size . Intensive , qualitative ( preoperational groupings refer to the repetition of a size relationship between the pairs of elements within a series ( e.g. , a @#@ b @#@ c , etc . ) . The // continuous extension and intention of ' proximities forms the highest level of topological concepts " which foreshadows the projective and Euclidean system " in which extension and intention become more integrated and coordinated . The child masters intensive topological relationships of proximity , separation , enclosure , order , and continuity by the start of concrete operations and this provides the basis for developing quantitative concepts . Topological spatial concepts express general properties of space that are dependent on the child 's action and have nothing to do with either the coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity ( preoperational extensive and intensive groupings ) constitutes the final synthesis of topological relationships ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 ) .8 Topological relationships are merely the continuous series of individual elements that can be expanded or contracted at will and , there'Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1970 , p. 423 ) systematically studied the development of spatial concepts in children from ages two through twelve and found that " the earliest behaviors depend on spatial relations which are limited to internal elements of a single perceptual configuration ( or image representation ) , " independent of any other system of viewpoints or coordinates . Their findings emphasize the importance of topological relationships of neighborhood , surround , or enclosure ( e.g. , localization of topological positions ) , and of continuity and discontinuity . The relations of separation and order constitute the elementary topological concepts that precede the development of projective and Euclidean levels of spatial conceptualizations . Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1970 ) also found that children around the age of three and a half to four can perceptually recognize familiar objects and discriminate certain geometric forms based solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children begin to discriminate curvilinear from rectilinear shapes and finally , around the age of seven years , the child can recognize most complex shapes . In the study of spatial representations , they found that children 's conceptions of space begin with a reliance on elementary topological aspects such as neighborhood , surround , enclosure , without any account of projective coordination of above ? below , left ? right , before ? behind , or elementary Euclidean estimates of distance . The early stages rely solely on topological cues furnished by the elements of the perceptual field or on cues of simple symmetry . Subsequently , the child begins to recognize projective dimensions and comes to coordinate them when the concomitant topological cues are clear and available . These first projective coordinations remain basically egocentric , and the child is unable to make reversals . Later on ( around the age of seven ) , the child frees himself from his own point of view and is able to make simple reversals . Eventually ( at the age of ten or eleven years ) , the child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-defined topological cues. // fore , are unable to contribute to the conservation of straight lines , distances , or angles . Topological concepts are not based on a stable system that defines positions of objects or the shape and orientation of objects relative to various planes and points of view . In topological space " each continuous domain constitutes a space and there is thus no universal space operating as a frame and enabling objects or figures to be located relative to one another " ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 19,18/1967 , p. 467 ) . There are as many spaces as there are objects themselves and the intervals between objects either belong to the objects themselves or are not spatial at all . Proximity and separation lead to an appreciation of enclosure ( or surrounding ) , order , continuity , subdivision of lines and surfaces , and , ultimately , into an awareness of points . This development of topological space is essential for subsequent development of projective space , which includes an appreciation of perspective and a coordination of multiple perspectives , and for the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the integration of different systems of reference including horizontal and vertical coordinates and scales . The concept of the straight line is the basis for projective spatial relationships , and the possibility of transformations ensures equivalency of figures . Euclidean or metric space is based mainly on the concept of distance in which the equivalence of figures depends on mathematical equality . While projective and Euclidean concepts of space are distinct and we discuss their development separately , it is important to keep in mind that they actually develop as integrated projective-Euclidean concepts throughout the concrete and formal levels of operational thought . Each phase in the development of projective concepts of space achieves stability and equilibrium in the quantified coordinates of Euclidean concepts . Projective Concepts The elementary relationships in topological concepts of space ( separation , order , enclosure , etc. ) serve as the basis for the structural relationships that persist as the concepts of space until the first period of operational thought is established ( around the age of seven ) . Projective concepts of space add to topological concepts the capacity of " locating objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other within a given perspective " . The child has already learned certain elementary projective relations ( e.g. , size and shape constancy ) at // the level of perceptual activity during the sensorimotor and preoperational phases . With the advent of the representation of images at the intuitive level , " coordination of fragmentary projective relationships progressively acquires more and more flexibility and efficiency . " Eventually , an operational system of projective relations is organized that coordinates perspectives and the reversibility of points of view . In the elaboration of projective space and perspective , the topological concept of simple linear sequence is eventually transformed into concepts of rectilinear coordinates , and the reciprocity of neighboring regions from one perspective is eventually transformed into the reciprocity of perspectives ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 , pp. 16-17 ) . Projective concepts involve the development of a specific point of view that can account for internal topological relationships of each individual element as well as the shape and relative position and distance of figures . The development of perspective permits the definition of the reciprocal relationships among the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in relation to one another and to the entire scene . In contrast to topological concepts , projective concepts involve a reference system that allows for the coordination of viewpoints and the coordination of planes on which figures are projected . According to Piaget and Inhelder ( 1948/ 1967 ) , projective space defines the relative positions of parts of figures , or figures relative to one another , and the whole in relation to an observer or the plane corresponding to his visual field . From the psychological stand-point , the essential feature of this process is the entry of the observer , or the " point-of-view " in relation to which the figures are projected . ( p. 467 ) The development of elementary projective concepts involves the same operations as the development of topological concepts , only with the addition of a viewpoint or frame of reference ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/1967 ) . For example , the addition of a particular viewpoint allows topological order to be constructed as a projected straight line that can be reduced projectively to a single point . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inside and outside a closed linear boundary , or a closed two-dimensional boundary ( surface ) , can be defined in projective space in the relative orientations of left and right , above and below , and before and behind , denoting three-dimensional space . Projection and sectional planes are two fundamental operations in projective space . The major task in projective // relationships is the coordination of successive or multiple viewpoints by means of elementary projections cut along various sectional planes . As with topological relationships , projective relationships are at first only " intensive , " qualitative , sublogical operations that later acquire quail ' halve , mathematical form . The addition of the projective dimensions ( before ? behind , left ? right , above ? below ) to the internal topological relations within a single object or configuration radically transforms the concept of space . A series of elements are arranged from the viewpoint of a single observer , such that one object partially hides another ( before ? behind ) and this constitutes the first basic dimension of projective space : the straight line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? below relations to the before ? behind dimension converts a surface or projective plane to create volume and three-dimensional space . Projective concepts conserve relative positions of objects in relation to the observer 's projective plane , but they do not account for objective distances and the actual dimensions of objects . Projective concepts are based on transformations of apparent size and shape that place objects in relation to one another from a single vantage point . With subsequent development of projective concepts of space , this coordination of perspectives increases in complexity , flexibility , and stability and enables the child to have an awareness of multiple points of view instead of he " egocentrism of a single and momentary viewpoint " ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 , p. 169 ) . Development in projective relationships involves the overall coordination of points of view that initially result from taking account of interposed objects or parts of objects . Order in projective space takes on the unique function of a straight line ; enclosures and groupings in projective space are not confined to inside or outside , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above ? below , and before ? behind . These relations result in the concept of a plane or set of planes ( as distinct from a surface ) in three-dimensional space . The multiplication of planes and reference systems creates a set of planes in three-dimensional space . These planes play a fundamental role in the representation of perspective in which height and width of the background are related to the dimensions of the foreground . Multiplicative groupings of relations in three dimensions facilitate the understanding of foreshortening and projective decreases in length . The coordination of successive perspectives provides the starting point for the development of an orthogonal system // of one-to-one correspondences along two or three dimensions , and this enables the child to recognize equivalent elements among varying perspectives . One ? many correspondences describe triangular structures such as a pair of perspective lines meeting at the horizon . While initially this system is two-dimensional , the one ? many correspondences of decreasing distance between the two perspective lines that form the relationship of the horizon to the foreground brings the child close to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perspective ( Piaget &; Inhelder , 1948/ 1967 ) .9 Projective space adds a new element to spatial conception because different elements of a single object are no longer considered solely in terms of the relations between elements of the object ( topological space ) , but now an object is considered in relation to an external observer . The change from topological to projective spatial concepts // derives from the subordination of objects to the observer and this radically transforms the basic dimensions of space . The observer 's " infinitely variable perspective produces a network of new relations ( e.g. , projective transformations , multiplication of perspective , etc. ) between the observer and the object " ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 , p. 247 ) . With the addition of a point of view external to the object , objects can be considered as to the left or right ( width ) , below or above ( height ) , or in front or behind each other ( depth ) . All three dimensions of space are created with the establishment of the individual 's perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect in the construction of projective concepts of space , therefore , is the establishment of the sense of self as a stable , enduring , unique reference point . As we discuss subsequently , the sense of self has not been discussed extensively by Piaget , but he has discussed the development of three levels of egocentrism and the " decentering " from each of these egocentric levels as an important aspect of the development of projective concepts of space . The development of the concept of left and right has been studied extensively and the complex sequence involved in its development is an integral part of the long and complex process involved in the construction of projective concepts of space . Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1970 , pp. 250 ? 251 ) describe the development of the concept of left and right as proceeding through three successive stages following a progression of " decentration going from pure egocentrism to complete relativity . " During the first stage ( ages five to eight years ) left and right are distinguished egocentrically , solely from the child 's own point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a " relation of internal opposition . " The second stage ( ages eight to eleven years ) corresponds to an early form of relativity ( " reciprocity of viewpoints " ) in which the child , through a process of simple reversals , becomes able to recognize the left and right of a person opposite t lae child . This is the beginning of the establishment of the variable , or multiple , viewpoint . Finally ( around eleven to twelve years ) , there is omplete objectification and reciprocity ... and the child . . . is then able to consider concepts of left and right from the point of view of t lie objects themselves . " At this highest level , the viewpoint of the subject is integrated with the viewpoint of the object in a single system . In this stage , the child becomes capable , for the first time , of a general coordination of viewpoints that is a synthesis of two distinct groups of relations . The coordination of viewpoints and the integra80 2. 1 ' hr Development of Mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of formal operations . Relative concepts of time , speed , movement , and the comprehension of proportions require the coordination and integration of several relations into a single general system in which all constituent elements of the relations are considered simultaneously ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 ) . According to Piaget , these formal operations do not bear directly on the relations between objects but rather on the relationship among relations . Piaget attributes the relatively slow development of projective concepts of space to the fact that a given object is no longer considered by itself but is now considered in relation to an external observer , and these perspective relationships are based on " a complex system of relative viewpoints . " There is an integration of a succession of partial perceptions and perspectives into " a general system which includes simultaneously all the relationships existing between the observer and each of the objects as well as between the objects themselves " ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 , p. 310 ) .10 // In addition to the concepts of ' up and down and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of projective space is the concept of ' the diagonal . Recent research ( Dolle , Bataillard , &; Guyon , 1973 ? 74 ; Dolle , Bataillard , &; Lacroix , 1974 ? 75 ; Dolle , Vinter , &; Germain , 1974 ? 75 ; Olson , 1970 , 1975 ) indicates that the attainment of the concept of the diagonal is a central aspect of the development of projective concepts of space . Horizontal and vertical , in contrast to the diagonal , are invariant dimensions with specific and fixed images and are therefore easier to discriminate and represent than diagonal or oblique lines . There is considerable evidence indicating that up and down is easier to discriminate than left ? right , and that both of these are significantly easier to discriminate and conceptualize than the diagonal ( Goldmeier , 1972 ; Olson , 1975 ) . Olson ( 1970 ) in studying the child 's capacity to construct the diagonal concludes that the diagonal is an essential dimension of projective space because it requires more than just an appreciation of an invariant dimension , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line using the self as the reference point . The construction of the diagonal requires an appreciation of the properties of sequences and the extension of sequences through space . Once the concept of diagonality is achieved , it is a conceptual structure that has stability , generality , and reversibility ? in Piaget 's terms it has equilibrium at an operational level . In order for the child to construct the diagonal at the appropriate age ( around the age of nine ) , the component forms and features of the diagonal must be differentiated from other concepts . t // The construction of ' the oblique is only achieved by the complex coordinated representation of asymmetrical deviations front both the vertical and horizontal , the differentiation of the diagonal from other relevant schemata , and the transformation of perceptual images of the diagonal into non-linguistic conceptual categories and schemata ( Olson , 1975 ) . The schema involves , in its early form , defining oneself as a reference point and establishing the diagonal as an extension from this reference point into space . The establishment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to deal with variable dimensions that are more complex and unstable than the invariant dimensions of horizontal and vertical ( Witkin , 1965 ) . The important role of the concept of the diagonal in the development of projective space is indicated in the studies of Dolle and her colleagues ( Dolle , Bataillard , &; Guyon , 1973 ? 74 ; Dolle , Bataillard , &; Lacroix , 1974 ? 75 ; Dolle , Vinter , &; Germain , 1974 ? 75 ) on the mental and graphic representation of three-dimensional space . " Dol- footnote " In a detailed analysis of children 's ability to understand and learn how to depict a cube , Dolle and her colleagues found three major developmental stages in the child 's acquisition of perspective . Before the age of six or seven , in the preoperational levels , the child can correctly describe a cube when it is perceptually available , but the ability for the mental construction and graphic rendering of the cube proceeds through a lengthy and ordered developmental sequence . In the first stage , from six to nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphically a three-dimensional cube and is usually content simply to enumerate the various properties of the cube . Although the child has a perceptual understanding of the cube , graphic productions are restricted to the " perceptually visible . " The child simply enumerates the faces of the cube by surrounding the frontal square with rectilinear deformations of the other sides . The child 's verbal descriptions and graphic renderings emphasize topological characteristics of separation , juxtaposition , surround , and continuity of separate elements of the total figure . While children recognize the cube and can describe it , they have not yet formed a mental representation of it and can not graphically reproduce it , despite the numerous suggestions by the experimenters . In the second major phase in the development of the concept of the diagonal , from age nine to twelve , the child 's first representation of threedimensional space is indicated by the use of an oblique or diagonal line that connects two parallel planes and indicates a recession of a lateral surface from the vantage point of the child 's visual angle . Dolle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective was constructed exclusively from the viewpoint of the subject . The child 's discovery of the oblique line seems to be based on the perceptual discovery of the recession of one angle from the frontal face of the cube . The production of one oblique ( r 's findings indicate that the child , in learning to represent volume and perspective , proceeds through the three major phases articulated by Piaget : the topological , projective and Euclidean concepts of space . The representation of volume appears to be quite independent of perceptual processes and much more contingent upon the development of cognitive schemata at appropriate times after more limited techniques and concepts have been well established . Dolle 's findings are consistent with the findings of Olson ( 1970 , 1975 ) and indicate that the concept of the diagonal or the oblique is a major developmental step in the development of projective space and the capacity to represent perspective and volume . These research findings also support the contention that the development of projective space requires the development of the sense of self as a stable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept of the self in the development of projective and Euclidean concepts of space , he does discuss the role of various levels of egocentrism . Egocentrism was a central construct in Piaget 's early formulations of the development of space , but eventually he found the concept ambiguous and used it less // and less frequently . In his introductory comments to Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1970 ) , Piaget notes that there are positive and negative aspects to egocentrism . Piaget discusses three levels of egocentrism , and at each level of development egocentrism plays a constructive role in the child 's early attempts to understand reality by relating aspects of the immediate situation to prior experiences . This aspect of egocentrism is an inherent part of the process Piaget calls assimilation . While an egocentric primacy of the child 's actions and point of view are initially useful to the child in the process of assimilation , eventually several levels of egocentrism must be relinquished in order for the child to appreciate actions and perspectives of others and to integrate and coordinate them with his own viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of egocentrism . Though Piaget ( 1970a ) continues to have reservations about the value of his concept of egocentrism , Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1962 , 1970 ) found the concept essential for understanding the child 's development of projective space and concepts of causality . Piaget , in his developmental theory , articulated three levels of " egocentrism " and demonstrated how the child , in relinquishing succeeding levels of egocentrism , comes to appreciate actions and perceptions different from his own and is able to integrate and coordinate them with his own viewpoint . Each succeeding level of egocentrism is relinquished through a gradual process of " decentration . " There are three successive levels of egocentrism ? from an initial state of total egocentrism to full objectivity ( Inhelder &; Piaget , 1955 ) . At first , the child has no image of himself or of the external world ; the two exist as one undifferentiated reality . Gradually , he becomes reciprocally aware of himself and of others . Throughout the sensorimotor and preoperational stages , there is an initial decentration in which the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He assumes , however , that his immediate viewpoint is the // only possibility and that it is shared by others ; e.g. , if he covers his eyes lie assumes that not only can he not see you , but also you can not see him . This initial stage of egocentrism , in which the child confuses his actions and views with those of others , is finally resolved by the time the child begins the period of concrete operational thought ( ages six to seven ) . A second decentration begins to occur as part of the development of concrete operational thought , from about the age of six to seven to t he age of eleven to twelve . Initially , the child is able to recognize and appreciate only his own perspective , but gradually he begins to recognize that his own displacement results in a changed point of view . He then becomes aware that if different positions are held by different people , different perspectives result . Thus he becomes aware of his subjective existence and of the multiplicity of other possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object among other objects and of the relativity of his personal perspective . Ile is able to maintain his unique perspective while appreciating and understanding the viewpoint of others ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1962 ) . Finally , at the level of formal operations ( beginning around twelve years of age ) , there is a third decentration in which a final form of egocentrism is relinquished and the child differentiates his perspective from the reality to which he must adapt . He becomes aware not only of the independent existence of objects but also of the independence of his cognitive processes from the environment . He becomes aware that he is responsible for his construction and understanding of reality . With this reflective self-awareness and appreciation of the nature of his own thought processes , as well as the viewpoints of others , the child can develop genuine social reciprocity in which he can maintain his own subjectivity while appreciating the subjectivity of others and differentiating it from the more objective dimensions of reality . As Piaget notes ( Laurendeau &; Pinard , 1970 ) , at the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relativistic dimension in the understanding and interpretation of nature . Feffer ( 1959 , 1970 ) considered the implications of Piaget 's formulations of the development of egocentrism for social behavior . Using concepts of social psychology , particularly the work of Solomon Asch , Feffer discusses how effective social interaction requires the capacity to consider oneself simultaneously both as subject and object and to take the viewpoint of the other while maintaining one 's own viewpoint . Complementarity in social interaction involves being able to
