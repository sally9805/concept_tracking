The House Republican whip backed the bill . So did a ranking party member on the Ways and Means Committee . Joining them was the entire Republican delegation from North Carolina plus an additional 52 G.O.P. Congressmen , including four seeking seats in the Senate this fall . The bill ? The Democrats ' harsh protectionist trade measure , opposed by President Reagan , which passed two weeks ago on a 295 to 115 vote after many once loyal free traders were spooked by what has become a looming issue in the 1986 campaign . <P> The U.S. trade deficit grew to an all-time high of $148.5 billion in 1985 , up more than 20% from the 1984 peak . In Washington , this may sound like just another economic indicator , but back home where Congressmen campaign , the figure means unemployment , and trade has become a hot regional issue . Textile workers in North Carolina , shoe manufacturers in New England and Missouri , steelworkers in the Midwest and lumberjacks in the Northwest have been the most vocal in their complaints . " The perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " Administration is n't doing enough . " <P> Sensing an issue ready for exploitation , House Democrats , led by Speaker Tip O'Neill , crafted a bill that would mandate retaliatory action against any major trading partner of the U.S. that achieves an " excessive trade surplus " through what are perceived as unfair means . Said White House Communications Director Patrick Buchanan : " It 's definitely going to help some Democrats on a local basis . " <P> Unwilling to let the Democrats take advantage of the trade issue , many Republicans jumped ship . Among the five from North Carolina who did was James Broyhill , who is running against former Democratic Governor Terry Sanford for the Senate . When Sanford kicked off his campaign last week in Burlington , one of many North Carolina towns where the textile industry has atrophied , he brought up trade policy . The previous day Broyhill had blasted the Democrats ' protectionist bill but ended up voting for it . <P> Colorado Republican Ken Kramer , who is running for the Senate seat Gary Hart will vacate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade bill Kramer voted against Reagan . Joining him was Tim Wirth , the Democratic candidate for the Hart seat . Republican Congressman Henson Moore of Louisiana used to be an ardent free trader . But he is running against ! Democratic Congressman John Breaux for the Senate , and both voted for the bill . <P> In a speech that received a tepid reception from the National Association of Manufacturers , President Reagan called the trade bill a " kamikaze " measure that would " send our economy into the steepest nose dive since the Great Depression . " But to show his concern for the trade deficit , he announced that Washington was close to an agreement with Tokyo that would open Japanese markets to more U.S. computer chips . <P> There is probably little chance that the get-tough bill will pass the Senate intact and survive a presidential veto . Its importance is mainly symbolic , showing how the trade issue could become highly politicized this election year . The White House fully expects Democrats to ride it for all it is worth . Says Political Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment . "
