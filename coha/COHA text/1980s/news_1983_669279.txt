What looked like a pasha ' s ransom glittered from the dozens of booths and tables filling the cavernous , white-columned display halls of the show . Behind one display table a man in a gray suit added up carats as though they were groceries for a woman who had just bought a tiara ' s worth of jewels . One of the lures of the show , which draws 16 , 000 visitors in four days in June , is that gems and jewelry are sold for roughly half the price they would fetch retail. // The man who can tell you all about that is gem impresario Herbert Duke , who runs not only this exhibit but more than a dozen others annually from his company , International Gem Shows Inc. , in Bethesda , Md. // Mr. Duke shimmered at the opening of the Washington show : On his right hand he wore two large opal rings , which flashed blue fire ; on his left hand , a 200-year-old Italian sardonyx cameo ring , and a large imperial jade ring . His belt buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opal . ' ' But it ' s phony opal , you can see that , ' ' he said , flashing the buckle back and forth . ' ' With the real opal you get a change of color ; with the phony , the color stays flat . ' ' Opals were big news at this year ' s show . One entrepreneur , Dag Johnson , brought with him a million-dollar opal collection. // Mr. Duke , wearing antique cloisonne cuff links with his white-on-white damask shirt with the pagoda design , gray trousers , blue jacket , and striped tie , acted as master of ceremonies . A mustachioed man of medium height with silver hair and a zest for jewels , he is also the publisher of ' ' The Crown Jewels of America , ' ' a trade catalog , and leader of gem safaris to India , Nepal , and Sri Lanka. // The ambassador from Sri Lanka , Ernest Corea , in a glen-plaid suit , was on hand to cut the red plastic ribbon on opening day . He told the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers of the world ' s best stones , ' ' and added : ' ' Those of you who have been to a gem pit may be surprised that what comes out in a raw and yucky state is what turns into a beautiful stone exhibited here . . . . ' ' His wife stood by smiling , wearing an amethyst necklace , tiny pearl earrings , and national dress : a purple print sari-wrapped skirt called a redda and a white lacy blouse , known as a hatte. // ' ' Don ' t ask me to pose again , I just did it for 20 minutes , ' ' sighs the Sri Lankan ambassador , darting away from the flash bulbs and the jeweled replica of the Crown of Charlemagne . Back in the show ' s office , Mr. Duke says that the 200 companies here came not only from all across the United States but include Chinese , German , Brazilian , Hong Kong , Sri Lankan , and Australian gem-meisters. // For fans of jewel-heist films like ' ' Topkapi ' ' and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are occasional moments of intrigue on the glitter circuit . A small gang of jewel thieves zeroed in on some of the dealers during a recent West Coast trip . He says they tried to force exhibitors ' cars off the road and slashed tires in parking lots or distracted sellers at their booths to divert attention during theft attempts ( the thieves were un-successful ) . // One of the gang was eventually caught , but the others have eluded the police so far , he says . But Duke emphasized that security guards were out in force at the Washington and other shows , some of them visible but many of them plainsclothes men and women. // At the show , many of the stomes were set out on tables in pans or dishes , like food at a family picnic . At the Prescott Turquoise booth , owner Herbert Kuglmeier displayed his Arizona turquoise in big plastic dishpans , showing the stages from big aqua hunks of stone , through the chemical and heat process , into the sanded and polished pieces used for jewelry. // At Rockyland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire opals in water . And at Tom Tanaka ' s booth you could learn to pan gold in a green plastic tray , where the tiny crusts of real gold suddenly emerged right before your eyes from a heap of dirt washed with water . At the same place , you could have bought a $12. 50 bag of sapphire gravel packeged by Gem Mountain Sapphires of Phillipsburg , Mont . With that and an inexpensive panning kit , you can pan your own blue , pink , and yellow sapphires. // Of course , some of the most precious objects were screened by glass : the $100 , 000 rectangular blue topaz that weighed 1 , 216 carats and looked like a tray full of blue ice , for instance , at the University of Richmond gem museum display . Or the $100 , 000 Ming dynasty tea service of nephrite jade the color of sea-foam and 600 years old , at the booth of jade master carver Hing Wa Lee . Also behind glass was a sculpture of a boy under a bamboo tree which Lee had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches of treasure priced at $16 , 000 . Out on a table nearby pranced his handsome delft blue cloisonne horses at $4 , 000 each. // ' ' I want an emerald ring and I don ' t where to start . Can anyone tell me whether I ' m in the neighborhood of $200 or $200 , 000 ? ' ' asked a blond buyer in a white pantsuit . ' ' It depends on the color , wheather it ' s clear or not or whether it has inclusions or not , ' ' said a voice behind the booth at N. V. Malhotra ' s. // Mr Malhotra displayed a $900 emerald and a $4 , 000 emerald side by side ; the $900 one looked like lime Jell-O compared with the $4 , 000 one , which was a deep , glorious green , Nearby glittered a 10-carat , $12 , 000 tanzanite of the violet-blue color identified with Elizebeth Taylor ' s eyes , and a rare green garnet ( most garnets are dark red ) at $1 , 500 a carat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12 , 000 art deco diamond bracelet , 18 1/2 carats ' worth of white diamonds , which the Pirates spokeswoman said would retail for $20 , 000. // Then too , you may never have seen an opalized gastropod , which is simply a snail shell that has taken on an opal crust through centuries of silt from inland seas in Australia . These shimmering snails and opalized plesiosaurus bones were part of the display in Dag Johnson ' s opal collection , Mr. Johnson is a blond Norwegian who at 16 struck off for South Australia and soon parlayed a $4. 75 investment in an opal mine into millions . He exhibits a gorgeous hunk of green and blue opal known as the Queen of the Pacific , 30. 89 carats ' worth of splendor that is , he says , literally priceless ; Queen Elizabeth II owns the other half of it. // ' ' A good opal glows in the dark. ' ' said Johnson , dimming the lights on the Queen of the Pacific , which pulsed with color like the northern lights . The names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey opal , a $49 , 000 Andamooka opal. // Jean Ryan , of Ryan ' s Artistry in Gems , Yorba Linda , Calif. , says she and her husband ' ' do 33 shows a year. ' ' criscrossing the country between trips to Germany and Brazil , meeting many of the same people at the Washington show , which is like a class reunion . The Ryans ' piece de resistance is an enhydros with dragons , a piece of lavendr-gray agate carved into a dragon shape , with water trapped naturally between the dragons in the agete . At $10 , 000 , it ' s the sort of collector ' s item that will help pay the costs of a trip like this : Travel fare plus $745 for a booth , in addition to hotel room and food bills. // //
