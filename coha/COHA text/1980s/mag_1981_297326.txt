THE FOUR SEASONS Directed and Written by Alan Alda <P> In the spring , a middle-aged man 's fancy ponderously turns to thoughts of airline hostesses . This despite the fact that Nick Callan ( Len Cariou ) is engaged in a less taxing rite of renewal-joining with his wife ( Sandy Dennis ) and their best friends the Zimmers ( Jack Weston and Rita Moreno ) and the Burroughses ( Alan Alda and Carol Burnett ) to open the latter 's vacation house for the season . <P> By summer , when the group has chartered a boat in the Caribbean , Nick 's wife , a neurotic photographer , has been replaced by Ginny the stewardess ( Bess Armstrong ) , who is pretty and sensible but who rocks their boat with her enthusiastic lovemaking . Not only does it keep the other couples awake all night , it makes them wonder where the magic of their marriages has gone . <P> In autumn , the friends spare a thought for their children , particularly Lisa Callan ( Beatrice Alda ) , the college-student daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely inarticulate , well beyond the reach of parental jolly-ups . Meantime , Kate Burroughs has reached the crockery-throwing stage . The unfailing reasonableness of her husband , she decides , is a mask for emotional impoverishment . <P> By winter , the stewardess is pregnant , and she feels excluded from real intimacy with the other couples . Danny Zimmer , older than the rest , is convinced that he is skating on the thin ice of mortality . When he falls through a frozen pond , in an unnecessary effort to rescue Ginny , the irony of one life 's beginning as another starts to close down is contemplated . <P> The Four Seasons is Alan Alda 's promising , if imperfect directorial debut . The promise and the very real pleasures of the film derive from its eagerness to explore the mid-life passage with good-humored civility . Alda is particularly good at examining the male sensibility . Cariou 's philanderer is troubled by the directions in which his sexuality has driven him , puzzled by the ways in which marriage has ill used his wife as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes clear that his comic fussings over his diet and his money are a way of raging against the dying of the light . Alda is perhaps hardest on the man he plays , showing that the very characteristic that has made him one of the country 's most popular actors - sweet common sense - can sometimes prevent one from feeling anything very profoundly . <P> Alda is less secure in dealing with the women . Moreno has no role . The Sandy Dennis character is excessively loony even for a person caught up in the crisis of separation . Except for the confrontation scene with Alda , Carol Burnett is a bystander , but without being intrusive , she creates an appealing character through her intelligent responses to the action swirling about her . But it is Armstrong , playing the young intruder , who gets to comment on the habits and assumptions of these old friends and so has the best female role .
