Twenty years ago , at the crest of the civil-rights movement , it was a seeming anachronism , written off by some blacks who denounced it as a relic of segregation and an unsavory reminder of intraracial stratification. // " It was kind of an embarrassment to middle-class blacks who thought they were aware and with it , " said Dr. Alvin Poussaint , an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University. // Now , with 38 , 000 members , 1 , 800 of them in the New York City area , Jack and Jill has become one of the largest black family groups in the country , offering social and civic activities for children and giving thousands of dollars to family-related charities , according to its president , Ramona W. Arnold of Los Angeles. // As more blacks move up the socioeconomic ranks and into predominantly white suburbs , members say the organization is experiencing a resurgence and renewed acceptability among some of the very people who rebuked it a decade ago. // The Westchester County chapter , the largest in the area , says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted a policy of dropping members who have missed three meetings without excuse to allow room for growing numbers of interested families , according to Alexandrina Douglass , president of the chapter. // Dr. Hazel Estepan , a pediatrician , joined after she moved from the Bronx to New Rochelle , N.Y. , and had difficulty finding friends for her two children . She and her husband , an internist , found that their children ' s isolation skewed their perceptions of other blacks. // " They were attending private school , and , seeing the other kids ' housekeepers , they got the impression that all black people were housekeepers , " she said . " They needed to see that black people can be dentists , lawyers , doctors , anything . I didn ' t want them to think that we were the only ones. " // Mrs. Estepan ' s ideals were not very different from those of Marion Stubbs Thomas , who in 1938 gathered together 11 mothers in Philadelphia to form a play group for their children , limiting membership to those with children from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74 , said in a telephone interview from her Washington home that she named the group after the familiar nursery rhyme to indicate its coeducational nature. // The group was created to help black children move " up the hill " and into productive positions in mainstream America . It grew rapidly during the 40 ' s and 50 ' s when segregation forced the country ' s few black doctors , lawyers and other professionals to turn to each other to provide stability and companionship for their children. // But during the 60 ' s and the 70 ' s the organization lost its attraction for some . A decade ago Dianne Caesar , who lives on the Upper East Side , rarely admitted to belonging to Jack and Jill as a child in North Carolina. // " I didn ' t even want to hear about it , " Mrs. Caesar said . " I felt , ' Don ' t even mention it to me . ' I was too busy marching and demonstrating " in civil- rights protests. // But after she gave birth to a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to introduce her to other black children , " said Mrs. Caesar , whose husband , Adolph , has been nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role as Sergeant Waters in " A Soldier ' s Story. " // " I didn ' t have many friends at the time - my husband ' s crowd is the theater crowd , " she said . " And I wanted to meet parents with the same wants and wishes for their children . " <> <> Social Conscience // A new generation of more politically active parents , who donned dashikis in the 60 ' s and pored through Alex Haley ' s " Roots " in the 70 ' s , has changed the face of Jack and Jill. // These new members are different from their predecessors who " used to put on formal dinners for themselves and act out E. Franklin Frazier ' s ' Black Bourgeoisie , ' " as Dr. Poussaint put it. // They are still going on the hayrides and the ski trips that characterized the organization for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger crisis and monitoring child welfare legislation , members said . <> <> Long Waiting Lists // Mothers join on behalf of their children . But new mothers are admitted only if their mothers were members when they were children or if they are sponsored by current members in good standing . Despite the stringent membership procedures , local chapter presidents say there are long waiting lists. // As members , parents and their children meet monthly for activities ranging from slumber parties and horseback riding to trips to New York Knicks games and New York Philharmonic concerts , said Rebecca Veal , Brooklyn chapter president . Mothers meet periodically at neighborhood churches , day-care centers and private homes , and there are annual teen conferences and biennial national and regional conferences. // In its 48 years , the organization has helped enrich the childhood of generations of black professionals and has counted among its members prominent mothers such as Jean Young , wife of Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young , and Betty Shabazz , widow of Malcolm X. // But it also has weathered criticism that it once showed preference for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mrs. Caesar , who grew up in Jack and Jill in Winston-Salem , N.C. But the organization , she recalled , provided cultural exposure she would not otherwise have got in the segregated South in the 50 ' s. // " Growing up when I was growing up , the town was closed to us , " she said . " There was no such thing as going to the city swimming pool . You had to provide your own . " <> <> Good Grades and College // Jack and Jill provided that kind of alternative when she and other black children in a ballet class were advised to see Swan Lake , which was being performed at a local theater . " Our white teacher said it was every ballerina ' s dream , but she apparently forgot that we couldn ' t go to see it , " Mrs. Caesar said. // Undeterred , Jack and Jill parents rented a college auditorium so that the children could see the movie version. // These parents no longer have to sidestep Jim Crow laws to nurture and rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them good grades and college degrees. // " Once every five or six years , we ' ll have one or two kids who can ' t get their act together , " said Ardath Hill , president of the Manhattan chapter . " They may sit out a year , but they go to college eventually . " Right now , Yale and Brown are " pretty big " among those in the Manhattan chapter , she said. // " We all want to be professionals , " said Mrs. Hill ' s daughter Kimberly , 16 years old , a junior at the Fieldston School . " A lot of us are already thinking about graduate school . We don ' t want to sit around in nothing jobs . We want good jobs , nice husbands and nice homes . We want the same things that have been provided for us . " <> <> Misunderstandings // According to Mrs. Hill and others , many families that fill the Jack and Jill roster in the New York area chapters lead prosperous lives - summer homes in the Hamptons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Caribbean. // Their success , like that of many other middle-class blacks , often places them in a lonely world , resented by many less-fortunate blacks and misunderstood by many of their white counterparts , members said. // Their success has made Jack and Jill as vital now as it was during the peak of segregation , as they seek out people like themselves. // " Most of my good friends were white before I really got into this , " said Kimberly Hill . " With Jack and Jill , it ' s nice to know there are people going through the same things you are. " // //
