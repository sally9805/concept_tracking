Glynn Blackwell learned Saturday night that you can indeed come home again . Blackwell , a Highland Park , Mich. , native playing his final collegiate basketball game in his home state , drilled his first seven shots from the field and finished with a game-high 19 points to lead Illinois ( 16-8 , 6-5 ) to an 83-65 victory over Michigan State in Jenison Fieldhouse . " I knew that I haven ' t been playing up to my abilities in the last few games , " said Blackwell , who came out of his recent shooting slump with a vengeance . " I needed to get myself back on track . Tonight , I forced it once or twice , but I felt I played good . I hope I can keep it up . I hope the team can keep it up . " Blackwell hit his first shot , a jumper from just inside the 3-point stripe , 24 seconds into the game . It set the tone . The Illini would hit 7 of their first 8 shots and 20 of their 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were shocked . We never thought we ' d have that much of a lead , " said Illinois coach Lou Henson . " Michigan State has played well against some very good teams . " But the Spartans didn ' t play well against Illinois . They had 19 points in the opening 20 minutes . They also had 16 turnovers . " How you can fall behind by 27 points at halftime in your own gym , I ' ll never know , " said Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote , whose team ( 8-13 , 3-8 ) seemed unable to bounce back from Wednesday ' s disappointing 72-70 loss to Big 10 leader and No. 2-ranked Purdue . " You can talk about subpar performances , then you can talk about embarrassing performances . " Why , I don ' t know . Maybe Illinois was super . We had the slows on offense ; we were inept on defense . " Maybe , for a while at least , the Illini were indeed super . Illinois had shot 60 percent in the first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , the Illini topped that , hitting at a 67 percent clip in the first 20 minutes . Seven Illinois players got in the game in the first half . All seven scored , led by Blackwell and Nick Anderson with 11 each . All seven shot better than 50 percent . " I thought we played an excellent game against Minnesota and just kept it up tonight in the first half , " said Henson , who moved to within three victories of win No. 500 in his 26-year coaching career . " There ' s nothing like shooting the basketball . When you shoot it , it really picks up your team . " Only 7-foot center George Papadakos , who hit all four of his first-half field-goal attempts and had 10 of his 14 points before intermission , seemed in the game at all for the Spartans . " I don ' t know what happened in the first half , " Papadakos said . " It didn ' t look like we were playing hard . We can ' t be down by 25 points at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackwell hit a pair of jumpers in the opening minute of the second half to push Illinois ' lead to 50-19 before the Spartans , who twice went more than 4 minutes between points in the first half , started chipping away . Michigan State went on a 17-4 run over a 7-minute period to cut the gap to 19 . When sophomore Kirk Manns drilled a pair of 3-pointers , Michigan State closed to 63-48 with 7 : 04 to play . So Blackwell was called back to active duty . " Glynn ' s outside shooting really gave us a boost , but when Manns hit those two 3-pointers , we called on Glynn to shut him down , " Henson said . Ken Redfield , the Michigan State sophomore out of Weber High School , hit 15 of his team-high 17 points after intermission . The Illini hit 58 percent of their shots for the game , their second-best shooting performance of the season . They also drilled 25 of 29 free throws . Illinois did not attempt a 3-point field goal , marking the fifth consecutive game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even without 3-pointers , Illinois is quickly putting the memory of its recent four-game losing streak into the past . They are even beginning to think about the postseason . " Most of the guys want to make it to the ( NCAA ) tournament , " Blackwell said . " Right now , though , we just have to keep working on coming off those four losses . I ' m a senior and I want it as much as anybody , but right now we ' ve just got to keep cleaning up our record game by game . " It was another solid game for Illini sophomore Anderson , a Proposition 48 victim last year . Entering Saturday ' s contest , he had scored at least 14 points in each of his previous 8 games . In that span , the former Mr. Basketball of Illinois had averaged 18. 5 points a game . He also leads Illinois in rebounding with 5. 9 per game . " Nick ' s really coming along , " Henson said of Anderson , who had drawn criticism from the Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He ' s getting better and better . Six weeks ago , he didn ' t do a lot of things right . He does a lot of things right now. "
