Two salesman , who could hardly have imagined that this customer would later be explaining America to his comrades in the Communist Party ' s ruling Politburo , asked the young Russian to take off his hat. // " I took off my hat , and they looked at my forehead , " Mr. Yakovlev recalled Wednesday in an interview in the Communist Party Central Committee office where he oversees the making of Soviet foreign policy . " They said , ' We heard you all had horns. ' " // The striking thing when Mr. Yakovlev relates the story is his insistence that the salesmen were not joking . He remembers it as a request made " in all seriousness " by " plain , half-educated people , " one of " hundreds " of such encounters he had in America. // Thirty years later , the episode still seems to shape Mr. Yakovlev ' s view of America as a country unjustly arrogant about its own system and almost superstitious in its anti-Soviet views . <> <> Gorbachev ' s Closest Adviser // Already widely reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role as the closest adviser of Mikhail S. Gorbachev , the Soviet leader , Mr. Yakovlev has become an object of new fascination since the Kremlin shake-up Sept. 30 , when he was appointed to head a new commission on international relations. // Western specialists have resumed an old debate about his real nature : father of glasnost , or calculating propagandist ? Champion of coexistence , or inveterate anti-American ? // In his interview , Mr. Yakovlev volunteered surprisingly personal anecdotes and introspection about the events that shaped his early thinking and made him part of the small circle of men bent on changing the Soviet Union. // Mr. Yakovlev , who is 64 years old , is owlish in appearance , round-faced with thick eyebrows and wings of black hair combed back on the sides of a bald pate . His severe appearance , exaggerated by heavy , square glasses , is relieved in conversation by an engaging humor. // Mr. Yakovlev started his career in the Communist Party Propaganda Department , but in 1973 he was dispatched to Canada as Ambassador , banished from the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing Russian nationalists , according to another version for defending an investigative newspaper reporter who ran afoul of the Politburo . <> <> Wide-Ranging Curiosity // He evidently impressed Mr. Gorbachev , then an up-and-coming Politburo member , during a Canadian visit in 1983 . The envoy was soon summoned home , first to head the prestigious Institute of World Economics and International Relations , then as party propaganda chief. // Soviet intellectuals , and especially editors of the more adventuresome publications , say they consider Mr. Yakovlev the godfather of glasnost , their main protector when they have come under official attack for pushing the limits of expression , and a man of wide-ranging curiosity , a kindred spirit. // During the interview , he indicated he had read many works by Alexander Solzhenitsyn , the exiled Russian author who has been unpublished in the Soviet Union since 1966 , including both his early books on Stalin ' s labor camps and his later polemics against Leninism. // Mr. Yakovlev asked that his views on specific books not to be quoted because " I don ' t want to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he admires some of the works , while finding others offensive because they are disrespectful of views he holds sacred. // " I ' m an atheist , but I don ' t like it when Jesus Christ is portrayed in a movie as preoccupied with sex , " said Mr. Yakovlev , clearly referring to a fantasy sequence in Martin Scorsese ' s movie , " The Last Temptation of Christ . " " I don ' t like it . All people have something sacred . " <> <> ' Against Any Kind of Bans ' // But asked how society should treat works that some people find offensive , he responded : " Theoretically , I ' m against any kind of bans . Except for pornography and for works that violate public morals , calls for terror , violence , etc. " // His reputation for hostility to America stems in large part from his 1984 book , " On the Edge of an Abyss , " in which he depicts America as a place dominated by extreme right-wing views , " a country where freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are persecuted , where the press serves Big Business and where the basic rights of the individual are hampered , " where " militarism and war are the basic means of achieving foreign policy goals. " // In more recent remarks on foreign policy he has tempered his criticism of America , while calling for Moscow to shift more attention to Western Europe and Asia , which he sees as less driven by anti-Soviet phobias. // Mr. Yakovlev said this week that his view of the United States has always included a respect for the country ' s industriousness and a desire for peaceful coexistence . He added that he has recently seen signs of a more congenial attitude toward the Soviet Union , including President Reagan ' s evident conversion . But he defended his book , saying it was based on material culled from American political scientists. // " In this case , I ' m not at all about to change my views , except for those that time itself changes . " <> <> Devotion to Gorbachev // Mr. Yakovlev was effusive in his personal devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his desk . Change would have come to the Soviet Union without Mr. Gorbachev , he said , but it came sooner because of " his political acumen , his education and a surprising ability to understand the rhythms and demands of the time. " // Mr. Yakovlev said he was born to peasant farmers in the region of Yaroslavl , 150 miles north of Moscow . His mother was Christian and his father a nonbeliever , less a matter of conviction than of his dislike for the pastor . The elder Yakovlev was not a Communist Party member , but he kept Lenin ' s portrait in the house. // Mr. Yakovlev described himself as a naive youngster who was stunned to hear his father declare after a 1941 radio broadcast on Soviet friendship with Germany : " They ' re deceiving us . We are going to have war . " He said his own first doubts about authority came at the age of 27 , in 1950 , when he read an article by Stalin on the Russian language , pinpointing the origin of the dialect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , he said. // Mr. Yakovlev said his father was not devoted to Stalin , although his parents knew nothing of the intrigues in the capital . But his father , like many , recalled Stalin ' s time as one of a certain moral purity , preferable to the greed and amorality of the Brezhnev time . Once he asked his father to compare the two periods , and , after pondering , the old farmer said that under Stalin a man would make a chair for a neighbor and never think to ask for payment. // The story was intended to illustrate what Mr. Yakovlev says is the real challenge of perestroika , the delicate psychological business of trying to introduce sweeping changes without offending the proud memories of sacrifice and achievement . Mr. Yakovlev said he himself feels the tug of the past. // " Even now I try to understand - what about that enthusiasm , that belief ? Even the war that we had to live through , and during which we lost a lot of people , and a lot of my relatives perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t want to throw part of my life onto the garbage pile . And I ' m not going to do that . That ' s my life. " //
