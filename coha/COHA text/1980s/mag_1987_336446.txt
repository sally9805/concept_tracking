Last month Freshman Shannon Welcome , 18 , of Woodstock , Ill. , started classes at St. Mary 's , a small women 's college across the street from Notre Dame in South Bend , Ind . " I guess you could say it 's my dream school , " she exclaims . " I can take classes at Notre Dame but still have the intimacy and nurturing atmosphere of St. Mary 's . " Welcome is considering a law career , and , she says , " I think the competitive benefits of being in a women 's college will give me an edge . " <P> Mary Wadland , 20 , feels much the same about her education at Hollins College in Virginia . " I 've come out much stronger , I think , than I would have if I had attended a coed school , " says Wadland , who graduated in June after serving as student-body president . " We knew we were going to have to compete with men all our lives , " she observes , " and it was nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out charging . " <P> These votes for women 's colleges are just two in a newly resurgent constituency . The 1960s and ' 70s were lean years for women 's education . The opening of such male bastions as Yale , Dartmouth and the service academies helped draw so many crack high school girls into coed institutions that two- thirds of the nation 's 298 women 's colleges either went coed or closed their doors . But today the surviving 101 boast that undergraduate enrollment is surging , despite a declining pool of high school graduates . Last week a preliminary survey of 64 schools , conducted by the Women 's College Coalition , showed that the number of entering freshmen this semester has risen an average of 6.6% above last year , with some notable peaks around the academic landscape . The head count at California 's Mills College is up 20% ; freshman enrollment at the College of New Rochelle in New York has jumped from 92 to 144 . At Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania , early-admissions applications increased 50% to help make the freshman class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our applicant pool is up , the quality of students is up , and we 're doing quite well , " exults Martha Morris , admissions director at Chicago 's Mundelein College . <P> Why this dramatic turnaround ? " We 're doing a better job of getting out the message on how well women 's colleges train women for careers , " asserts Nicole Reindorf , the WCC 's associate director . Graduates of women 's colleges , she points out , generally outperform their coed counterparts . For instance , a 1985 survey of 5,000 women 's school alumnae found that nearly half had earned graduate degrees ( vs. one-third for all graduates from coed institutions ) . Of women listed in Who 's Who in America , women 's college alums outnumber coed- school graduates by more than 2 to 1 . And the bottom line turns out to be the bottom line : two years ago , the median salary for graduates of all-female colleges from the classes of ' 67 and ' 77 was $25,000 , about $8,000 more than for coed-school alumnae.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
