The placing of a baboon heart into the chest of little Baby Fae caused indignation in many quarters . For some , who might safely be called eccentric , the concern was animal rights . Pickets outside Loma Linda University Medical Center and elsewhere protested the use of baboons as organ factories . Dr. Leonard Bailey , the chief surgeon , was not impressed . " I am a member of the human species , " he said . Human babies come first . It was unapologetic speciesism . He did not even have to resort to sociology , to the argument that in a society that eats beef , wears mink and has for some time been implanting pigs ' valves in human hearts , the idea of weighing an animal 's life equally against a human baby 's is bizarre . <P> Others were concerned less with the integrity of the donor than with the dignity of the recipient . At first , before Baby Fae 's televised smile had beguiled skeptics , the word ghoulish was heard : some sacred barrier between species had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated . Indeed , it is a blow to man 's idea of himself to think that a piece of plastic or animal tissue may occupy the seat of the emotions and perform perfectly well ( albeit as a pump ) . It is biological Galileism , and just as humbling . Nevertheless it is fact . To deny it is sentimentality . And to deny life to a child in order to preserve the fiction of man 's biological uniqueness is simple cruelty . <P> Still others were concerned with the rights of the observing public , and its proxy , the press . For a while , when Baby Fae was doing well , the big issue was made out to be the public 's ( read : the press 's ) right to know . There were reiterated complaints about withheld information , vital forms not made public , too few press conferences . It is true that in its first encounter with big-time media Loma Linda proved inept at public relations . But how important can that be ? In time the important information will be published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting for judging this procedure than live television . <P> Baby Fae brought out defenders of man , beast and press . But who was defending Baby Fae ? There was something disturbing-subtly , but profoundly disturbing-about the baboon implant . It has nothing to do with animal rights or the Frankenstein factor or full disclosure . It has to do with means and ends . <P> It turns out that before placing a baboon heart into the chest of Baby Fae , doctors at Loma Linda had not sought a human heart for transplant . That fact betrays their primary aim : to advance a certain line of research . As much as her life became dear to them , Baby Fae was to be their means . <P> The end-cross-species transplant research-is undoubtedly worthy . Human transplants offer little hope for solving the general problem of children 's dying of defective hearts . There simply are not enough human hearts to go around . Baboons grown in captivity offer , in theory , a plausible solution to the problem . To give Baby Fae a human heart would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it might have advanced the cause of this child more than a baboon 's heart , which , given the imperfect state of our knowledge , was more likely to be rejected .
