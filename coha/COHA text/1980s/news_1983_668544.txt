Boston Mayor Kevin H. White and the city ' s three major commercial stations have been negotiating for several months , and it appears likely that if the mayor decides on becoming a political commentator when he leaves office in January , it will be with Channel 7 ( WNEV- TV ) . While spokesmen for Ch. 4 ( WBZ-TV ) and Ch. 5 ( WCVB-TV ) said that they are no longer interested in signing the mayor , Ch. 7 news director Jeff Rosser said that he is " cautiously optimistic " about reaching an agreement with White . An executive at Ch. 5 said that " the rumors of White signing with Ch. 7 have gone beyond the rumor stage and they ' re close to the fact stage . " " That , " said Rosser , " isn ' t true . I hope that he will do some things for Ch. 7 , but to date we have no agreement and we ' re not actively negotiating right now . " White ' s only comment on the situation was , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t want to discuss it at all . " George Regan , spokesman for the mayor , said , " The mayor ' s been besieged by a lot of people since May when he announced he wasn ' t running for re-election . The offers range from book publishers , law firms and the media . Nothing has been decided on anywhere . " Kenneth Fishkin , an attorney representing White on contractual proposals , could not be reached for comment . If Chs. 4 and 5 have indeed dropped out of the running , Rosser ' s optimism about signing White could grow less cautious . " Any man who ' d been mayor of a city for 16 years would be an asset as a regular contributor , " Rosser said . " Any of the three stations would love to have him . " Stan Hopkins , Ch. 4 ' s news director , said , " The terms of the agreement that the other stations were offering were so high that it was out of our ballpark . " Neither Rosser nor David Mugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been offered , but both said the rumored figure of $200,000 a year was way beyond what had been offered . " The days of heavy spending are over at Channel 7 , " said Mugar . Hopkins has other reservations about White . " What does he mean to a TV audience once he ' s out of office ? I ' m not sure that as a commentator on national issues , there ' s any great advantage there . " According to Phil Balboni , news director at Ch. 5 , " Negotiations have been going on for a long time and I decided not to bid at all , that the addition of the mayor as a commentator would not be a real asset to the station . " Balboni would not elaborate , but one theory is that Chs. 4 and 5 , which are neck-and-neck in terms of No. 1 ratings for their newscasts , have as much to lose in signing White as they have to gain . A federal investigation by the US Attorney ' s office into the White administration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a news desk might alienate more viewers than it attracts . But for Ch. 7 , far back in the ratings battle , that gamble might make more sense . Mugar thinks that one advantage Ch. 7 might have is that " We ' re a locally- owned downtown station . He has known Sy Yanoff ( Ch. 7 ' s general manager* and me for some period of time and there ' s a good deal of mutual respect . At the other stations , which are national syndicates , people may come and go . " Mugar ' s and White ' s relationship has been characterized as going beyond mutual respect into the area of friendship . " We ' re friendly to a degree , " said Mugar , " but people have an overperception of that in a sense . He ' s called on me on various logistic matters , such as the Pope ' s visit , in the past . " There are , of course , other options for White . Chs. 4 or 5 could reopen negotiations , although Balboni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the mayor could decide on not getting involved with television at all , but Mugar thinks otherwise . " I think he ' s quite interested . He ' s fascinated by television and wants to be involved in it . " In the meantime , viewers can get a hint of White ' s analytical talents tonight on all three stations . According to Hopkins , the mayor ' s office has agreed that he ' ll be interviewed about the mayoral race by Ch. 7 at 9:45 p.m. , Ch. 4 at 10:30 and Ch. 5 at 11:15 . Those times might be pushed back , depending on the closeness of the race .
