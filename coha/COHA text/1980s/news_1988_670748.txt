In the Dec. 14 column , about tropical oils , Pepperidge Farm was quoted as saying that it had " converted the shortening in its bread products to 100 percent soybean oil. " // A reader enclosed a label from the company ' s oatmeal bread in which the shortening is listed as " soybean , palm and/or cottonseed. " // " We wish , " said the reader , that " The Times would be more careful in checking the facts. " // A call to the company brought this explanation from Karen Sportini , a public relations assistant : the shortening has been changed , but the company is using up its old labels , a fact that it had neglected to explain . The company will continue to use the old packaging until it runs out. // Every effort is made to correct errors in a subsequent issue of the paper , but often a correction does not catch up with the reader , as with the dropped line from a recipe for apple oat bran muffins in the Nov. 2 issue. // Though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say they were still wondering what to do with the egg whites , applesauce , vegetable oil and dried apples . Since it is impossible to answer individual letters , perhaps this clarification will reach them at last . Combine the egg whites ( unbeaten ) with applesauce , vegetable oil and dried apples in a bowl and then continue with combining the applesauce mixture with oat mixture and the flour mixture ( see recipe ) . // Other readers have written to ask how to calculate consumption of certain nutrients , especially those they must restrict , like sodium . " The general recommendation for sodium consumption from the National Academy of Sciences is between 1. 1 to 3. 3 grams a day. // To figure out how much sodium you are adding when you season your food with salt , all you need to know is that there are 2 , 000 milligrams or 2 grams of sodium in a teaspoon of salt . And a teaspoon of salt is not very much. // The column on tropical oils ( Dec. 14 ) made one reader wonder why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into infant formula. // The saturated fats are added to infant formula so the formula will most closely resemble breast milk , which is high in saturated fat. // Infants need cholesterol for proper growth . That is why , experts explained in the May 18 column , infants should be given whole milk , not skim milk , until they are 2 years old. // On the subject of fat , several readers are questioning the word " palmitate " on the labels of processed foods . They wonder why palmatic acid , a saturated fatty acid , is used at all . Palmatic acid is used to put vitamin A , a fat-soluble vitamin , into the food . Thus the ingredient , vitamin A palmitate . But the amount of palmatic acid used is so small that it is of no concern , even to those on limited diets. // A reader enclosed a clipping from The Times saying erucic acid vegetable oil is not recommended because it can cause severe liver damage . This made him wonder how it was possible to sell rapeseed and canola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapeseed and canola oils that are low in erucic acid may be sold in this country . A technique to remove much of the acid makes it possible to use these oils , which have less saturated fat than even safflower and sunflower oils . But the label should say " low erucic acid . " If it does not , do not buy the oil. // The Dec. 7 column about microbiological hazards in food outraged many readers . One from New York City said : " Having eaten chicken all my life and never having had to worry about its carrying disease until just the last couple of years , what strikes me about it is that apparently State and Federal jurisdiction has broken down . Why does the burden of protecting our health fall upon us , the consumers , when supposedly our taxes are used to pay agriculture and health departments ? " // The reader went on to ask whether chicken that carried salmonella should be so labeled or perhaps chickens free of salmonella given some sort of stamp of approval . And she asked where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry salmonella because they are not raised in close quarters. // If that particular column did not make clear that cooking chicken thoroughly will kill any salmonella , it should have. // Free-range chickens are less likely to have salmonella , if they are raised away from other animals . They may be purchased by mail from D ' Artagnan , 399-419 St. Paul Avenue , Jersey City , N.J. 07306 ; 1-800-327-8246 . In New York , free-range chickens are available at the Union Square Greenmarket on Wednesdays , Fridays and Saturdays . They are also sold at Balducci ' s on the Avenue of the Americas near Ninth Street , Dean &; DeLuca on Broadway at Prince Street and Broadway Butchers , Broadway and 90th Street .
