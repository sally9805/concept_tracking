Daily , police mount close watch at the US Embassy in Warsaw to note identity cards and turn away all without ' ' valid ' ' business . Today that means admitting only Poles showing a passport and there to ask for an American visa. // The authorities have placed the embassy library off limits as reprisal for what is described as the anti-Polish ' ' unfriendly propaganda campaign ' ' in Voice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcasts in Polish . It seems an ineffectual tit-for-tat against the more serious background of the dip in a traditional relationship rooted in America ' s own struggle for independence . The ban militates mostly against young Poles anxious to consult or borrow reference works and literature relevant to their studies , as did the generation before them. // The step , one may presume , was dictated by Warsaw ' s ideological hardliners rather than by the diplomats of the foreign ministry . Some long involved in US affairs , both here and in Washington , must now defend it . They seem genuinely sad as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken. // ' ' But what else could we do ? ' ' a senior ministry official demands . ' ' We countenanced it ( Poles ' access to the library and its movie shows ) for years , without any agreement or similar outlet for ourselves in the US . In view of the Reagan administration ' s continuous hostility we decided it could not not go on. ' ' // It used to be that he and other usually moderate-minded officials talked of allowing Washington some ' ' benefit of the doubt . ' ' That , however , has given way to resentful assertions that Washington , especially the White House , ' ' does not not want to understand ' ' the reality behind all that has happened since August 1980 , that it sees Poland and its instability as merely an instrument to advance a presidential obsession with Russia and a crusade against ' ' the greatest evil on earth. ' ' // Being Poles , they may privately deplore the way the chips fell in Central Europe after the war . But they accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as part of the geopolitical reality of their country , wedged in between powerful neighbors . They are , moreover , unequivocal in stating that Poland ' s security is more assured today than at any time before. // ' ' You have to remember , ' ' says one of the most experienced foreign affairs experts here , ' ' it was the Russians who drove the Germans out of Poland and restored the Polish state . But for them , we would have again ceased to exist as a state . We would never have gained our present western border . Many of our own romantically minded young people - I ' m not concerned with the opposition - need to remember this , too. ' ' // Since February there has been no American ambassador here , though Washington has named a career foreign service officer , John Scanlan , for the post . Having served in Poland three times previously , Polish-speaking Mr. Scanlan is well known to the Poles , and apparently well respected . The authorities are withholding approval , however . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry official said . ' ' But while US attitudes remain as now we are leaving our answer open. ' ' // He and others like him insist that the Jaruzelski government has given enough signals of intention to further ease internal conditions - and of a desire to lower Polish-US tensions - to warrant some shift on Washington ' s part. // In February the ministry sent the head of its American department , Jan Kinast , to Washington . ' ' We really meant it as a gesture , ' ' the official said . ' ' We really hoped his talks in the State Department might lead somewhere . But there has been no response from the US - none at all. ' ' // Predictably , General Jaruzelski is concerned not to be seen in Moscow as making concessions under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church or the United States . The Soviet Union ' s dislike of the current papal visit , among other matters just now , is evident enough to an outside observer here let alone to Poles who must live with it. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own hard-line view of Poland on the Russians even more energetically than before . Each fears an impact of the papal visit among its own people . The Prague government , whose counterproductive crackdown on the churches has been intensified this year , is especially concerned. // Polish awareness of the hostility within the Soviet bloc seemed implicit in Vice-Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski ' s reply to a US network which recently asked him about the possibility of Lech Walesa meeting with the Pope . That was a matter for the Pope , Mr. Rakowski said . There was no such meeting in the formal program . If there were one , however , ' ' we would not not be happy about it. ' ' // Under such conditions , Jaruzelski could not conceivably give an outright , open yes to church and other appeals over amnesty for martial law offenders or to accept it as a US precondition for lifting economic sanctions. // The Pope knows well the pressures under which any Polish government must operate . He will therefore pursue Jaruzelski ' s recent hints of what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ostensibly a pastoral pilgrimage , he will utilize the opportunity for discussing obvious political issues with the Polish leader . One of these issues , moreover , will be the question of ' ' full diplomatic relations ' ' between the Vatican and Warsaw. // There is considerable feeling here now that , if the visit proceeds without incident , remaining aspects of martial law will be removed soon afterward . General Jaruzelski said as much in his recent speech to the ' ' conciliation ' ' - oriented Patrio . Should the Pope leave with firm assurance on such points , this would probably be enough for most West Europeans to modify their present standpoint . It would be difficult for the United States not to do so also. // //
