Ira Opper wonders how he got along without Surfline . A TV sports producer by profession and beach bum at heart , the Californian dials 976-SURF almost every day . For 95 cents a call , Surfline reviews beach conditions along 485 miles of coast from Santa Cruz to San Diego , updated twice daily based on reports from 100 part-time scouts . Says Opper , 39 : " It 's like having a direct line to King Neptune . " Thanks to devoted dialers like Opper , the 3 1/2-year-old Surfline handles 1.2 million calls a year in California and has expanded to three area codes in Florida . <P> Caller-paid services like Surfline are increasing faster than a Valley Girl 's phone bill . The number of such hot lines operating in the U.S. has doubled in the past year , to 3,800 , offering a growing Touch-Tone emporium of services ranging from the practical to the kinky . Customers can call for soap- opera updates , used-car prices , stock quotes , sex fantasies or rock-concert schedules . Prices run from as little as 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Total revenues are expected to reach $450 million this year , up 50% from 1987 . While the industry has already encountered a legislative clampdown that could limit the use of dial-a-porn and party lines , investors believe legitimate caller-paid services have huge growth potential . " This is a hot , faddish business right now , " says Chris Elwell , senior editor of the Information Industry Bulletin . " But it 's only in its infancy . " <P> Today 's dialing-for-data industry was actually born decades ago , when New York Telephone first started offering the time of day in 1928 and the weather report in 1937 . The company added Dial-a-Joke in 1974 and a recorded Santa Claus message the following year . But no one made money on the announcements until 1980 , when AT &T; launched its Dial-It service . The 900-prefix , long- distance lines enabled callers to participate in automated polls , typically sponsored by TV shows , for 50 cents for the first minute . Initially AT &T; pocketed all the toll charges , but in 1985 the company began sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The arrangement sparked a proliferation of long-distance call-in lines , from which AT &T; generated about $100 million in revenues last year . <P> Local dial-up services  --  carrying such prefixes as 976 , 540 and 410  --  started sprouting after the breakup of the Bell system in 1984 . The so- called Baby Bells , legally prohibited from offering their own information services , began forging alliances with hundreds of small firms . In exchange for the use of the telephone lines and their billing departments , Baby Bells charge a fee and also pocket a percentage of the monthly tolls . <P> As the industry grows , hot lines are catering to increasingly specific audiences . Anglers in Ohio can call the 976-FISH line to find out what 's biting . Superstitious residents of New York City can ring up the 976-TARO ( short for tarot ) to hear their fortunes , while nonsmokers can call 540- LUNG to find out about the latest tobacco-industry liability cases . Customers with Touch-Tone phones can program a wake-up service in which the customer will be greeted by a sultry recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
