STAR TREK II : THE WRATH OF KHAN Directed by Nicholas Meyer Screenplay by Jack B. Sowards <P> For once it is not an obscure virus from a faraway planet that threatens the good starship Enterprise . No , this time the malaise comes aboard in Admiral Kirk 's ditty bag , and it is that common cold of the earthling 's psyche , a mid-life crisis . Since his promotion to flag rank , he has been deskbound and restless . For his latest birthday " Bones " McCoy has presented him with a pair of granny glasses for his failing eyes , a bottle of booze to lift his sagging spirit . Meanwhile , there is unfinished business that ought to be attended to : a grown son whose existence Kirk has never properly acknowledged ( all those long business trips did n't help ) and who is understandably resentful about his inability to get Dad 's attention . <P> There is nothing like a spot of action to cure the blahs , and luckily the Enterprise , now under Mr. Spock 's command , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a training mission , and Kirk decides to come along . Equally luckily , " the wrath of Khan " has been bottled up out there in the galaxy , steeping in its own malevolence , just waiting for someone to pull the cork . It happens that Khan , played by Ricardo Montalban , who appears delighted to send his dinner jacket to the cleaners and slip into something scruffy , blames Kirk for all his troubles . It seems the captain marooned him , his family and crew on a forbidding planet 15 years earlier . Now he decides to invade the space platform where Kirk 's scientist son and his scientist mother are engaged in good works , creating nothing less than a new Garden of Eden . By capturing Kirk 's family , Khan hopes to lure his old enemy into a fatal rescue attempt . This is the kind of situation that makes Kirk feel positively boyish . Lifted out of his psychological lethargy , he manages to can Khan and tie up the loose ends of his life . Why , with Mr. Spock helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather touchingly to terms with mortality .
