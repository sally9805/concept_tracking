PERUGIA , Italy - These ancient Italian towns , buttoned-up behind walls and perched for safekeeping on a hilltop , are made for walking . That doesn ' t mean the lean streets aren ' t cohabited by automobiles that grumble by so intimately that a pedestrian thinks about going on a diet immediately . Perugia , the capital of Umbria , to the north of Rome , is yet another well- kept , friendly town that proves out my mother ' s philosophy : " Take a chance - Columbus did . " Take any turn , plunge into any passageway , try any ramp - it always works out fascinatingly well . You are never far from Corso Vannucci , the broad , cobbled promenade lined with attractive shops , tired-but-proud palazzi and leading to a splendid l3th century fountain in dusty pink marble . Is this a street or a doorway ? I think the polite , white- helmeted policeman said Ristorante Lanterna would be this way . Turns out to be a street , Via Appia , one of Perugia ' s staircase thoroughfares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ' s the wrong street , but who cares ? It descends steeply onto Via Aquedotto , which isn ' t a street at all , but a narrow bridge - a rehabilitated aqueduct , really - over a flourishing valley dividing the town . Below are gardens , vineyards , and on either side the town is seen as apurposeful jumble of stone , all the structures interconnected . " Remove one brick , " speculates Bodo , " and the whole town might come tumbling down . " " Where is that restaurant anyway ? " " If we don ' t find that one , there ' ll be another , " Bodo says . " They ' re all merely terrific , and the prices are righter than I imagined . The dollar is stronger in Italy right now than garlic . Have you ever had a bad meal in Italy ? " " One , " I reply . " Yesterday , as a matter of fact . We made the obligatory pilgrimage to Assisi and St. Francis country ( a few miles distant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing was open but this one trattoria , and old mama knew she had us . No pasta . Some cold chicken and stuff for 20 bucks . Only time I ' ve been taken in this country . " But it was that kind of day . Damp , raw , and tons of tourist buses at the basilica where St. Francis is buried . Big year for St. Francis fans , the 800th anniversary of his birth . He must be amused by all the mobs tramping around his landmarks . " " Yeah , " Bodo says . " A very humble , sincere man of simple tastes . Wonder what he thinks of all the souvenirs stores - the St. Francis dolls that look like George Raft in a cassock ? " " The place I liked was the Cathedral of Santa Maria Degli Angeli just outside of Assisi . The church itself is cold and impersonal , but within is the Porziuncola , the tiny , rustic chapel where St. Francis worshipped . It once stood alone in the woods , nothing more than a quonset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s refreshing to find it among all the lofty architectural tributes that came later . Gives you the reassuring feeling that the saint was a human being . " Bodo says he thinks the restaurant may be up this way , and we find ourselves climbing another stairway and arriving in Piazza Raffaello at the top of the town . It is empty and hushed . The moon is rising . At our feet , outside the walls , spreads the newer Perugia , necessary but hardly in a class with the old town . Beyond , clouds resting on the hunched-up Appenines complete what seems an operatic backdrop . Back down we go , passing a lively Sala Giochi - game room - where kids are laboring at Pac-Man and other diversions . Bodo asks me if I ' ve watched any TV here . " Dallas " is all the rage now . I nod that I did tune into an episode and J.R . &; Co. appeared improved in Italian . " And , Bodo , what about the strip tease show last night ? Was that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Bowl-style coverage - cameras from every angle . " " No , that ' s a regular channel . Sensational when it started , but old stuff by now . Boring . " he says . " Then why do they keep it on - for the guys in raincoats ? " Presently , after innumerable ambulatory ups and downs , we find the restaurant , devour the usual marvelous pasta , then join throngs parading along Corso Vannucci , eating ice cream . All week I ' ve been lusting for one of the chocolate cakes in the window at Sandri ' s . The warped frosting seems an ice jam in sepia . " Come on , " Bodo says , " We ' ll get one and take it back to the hotel bar and have coffee and cake . " It looks like a very sinful cake , " I falter . " It is , " says Bodo , entering the store . " But even St. Francis would understand . He was human once , too . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
