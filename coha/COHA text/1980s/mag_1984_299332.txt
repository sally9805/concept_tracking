Utah struggles to tame a body of water turned outlaw <P> For three miles beyond what was once the eastern edge of the Great Salt Lake in Utah , cottonwood and birch trees stand in 9 ft. of brackish water , their trunks burned and their branches leafless . Dead wood and decaying , bloated carp litter the shore . Roads are flooded out , towers for power lines sit in muddy pools , and farther south , the famed Saltair resort with its Moorish-style gold domes is shut down . <P> Roiled since 1982 by prodigious storms , the 30-mile-wide Great Salt Lake has risen 10 ft. , its fastest climb ever , overspilling its borders and flooding the land around it . What was once the driest state in the union after Nevada is fast becoming a water wasteland : tens of millions of dollars ' worth of property has been destroyed , wildlife has diminished catastrophically , and tourism around the lake has bottomed out . Says Utah Governor Scott Matheson , with tragicomic wit : " It 's a helluva way to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide of destruction , workers with the Southern Pacific Railroad maneuvered a large crane last week along a 27-mile causeway built of 50 million cu . yds. of rock , sand and gravel that divides the lake into north and south sections . The aim of the engineers : to begin carving a 300-ft. breach in the causeway , the final step in a three-month , $3.2 million project . If they are successful , water on the south side of the lake will fall about 9 in. during the next two months , lessening the threat of floods to Salt Lake City , nearby suburbs , interstate highways and railroads . The north segment of the lake , located in a thinly populated area , could climb as much as 3 ft . <P> The recent deluge is only the latest crisis in the Great Salt Lake 's erratic history . Lying in the Great Basin between the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas , the lake collects runoff from the nearby Wasatch Range . Its only outlet is through evaporation , so the lake becomes 2 million tons richer each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some parts of the lake can be eight times saltier than the ocean . Perhaps even more remarkable , the Great Salt Lake generates its own weather system , known as the dreaded lake effect ( DLE ) . During early spring , when a storm moves into the area , the clouds over the lake are often colder than the water . As a result , warm air laden with moisture rises into the clouds , intensifying the storm . Normally , the most significant impact of the DLE is to enliven the skiing season with a few extra feet of snow . But in the 1870s the lake swelled to an alltime high of 4,211.6 ft. above sea level . In 1983 , April showers followed an exceptionally snowy winter and led to this year 's peak of 4,209.25 ft . Larger in an average year than Rhode Island , the lake has grown by 30% , to 2,250 sq . mi . As one Utah meteorologist puts it , " If you compared it to earthquakes , it would be as if you had a Richter scale from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . " <P> With an emergency at hand , the state spent $21 million to raise the interstate highway at the south end of the lake and another $50 million to clean up damaged Salt Lake City . Companies operating at waterside constructed dikes to protect their faculties .
