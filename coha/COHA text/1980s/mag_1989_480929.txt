It is conventional at graduation exercises to congratulate the graduates . Though my good wishes for your future could not be more fervent , I think I will refrain from congratulations . This , after all , is your commencement , and a beginning is the wrong time for congratulations . What I want to attempt instead is to say something useful about the problems and the opportunities that lie ahead of your generation and mine . Toward the end of As You Like It , Orlando says : " I can live no longer by thinking . " He is ready to marry Rosalind . It is time for incarnation . Having thought too much , he is at one of the limits of human experience , or of human sanity . If his love does put on flesh , we know he must sooner or later arrive at the opposite limit , at which he will say , " I can live no longer without thinking . " Thought ? even consciousness ? seems to live between these limits : the abstract and the particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought quickly produce a language that works as a code , uselessto the extent that it is abstract . It is readily evident , for example , that you ca n't conduct a relationship with another person in terms of the rhetoric of the civil rights movement or the women 's movement ? as useful as those rhetorics may initially have been to personal relationships . The same is true of the environment movement . The favorite adjective of this movement now seems to be planetary . This word is used , properly enough , to refer to the interdependence of places , and to the recognition , which is desirable and growing , that no place on the earth can be completely healthy until all places are . But the word planetary also refers to an abstract anxiety or an abstract passion that is desperate and useless exactly to the extent that it is abstract . How , after all , can anybody ? any particular body ? do anything to heal a planet ? Nobody can do anything to heal a planet . The suggestion that anybody could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on their white horses to save the planet ? and they keep falling off in front of the grandstand . What we need , obviously , is a more intelligent ? which is to say , a more accurate ? description of the problem . The description of a problem as planetary arouses a motivation for which , of necessity , there is no employment . The adjective planetary describes a problem in such a way that it can not be solved . In fact , though we now have serious problems nearly everywhere on the planet , we have no problem that can accurately be described as planetary . And , short of the total annihilation of the human race , there is no planetary solution . There are also no national , state , or county problems , and no national , state , or county solutions . That will-o ' - the- wisp , the large-scale solution to the large-scale problem , which is so dear to governments , universities , and corporations , serves mostly to distract people from the small , private problems that they may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , if we describe them accurately , are all private and small . Or they are so initially . The problems are our lives . In the " developed " countries , at least , the large problems occur because all of us are living either partly wrong or almost entirely wrong . It was not just the greed of corporate shareholders and the hubris of corporate executives that put the fate of Prince William Sound into one ship ; it was also our demand that energy be cheap and plentiful . The economies of our communities and households are wrong . The answers to the human problems of ecology are to be found in economy . And the answers to the problems of economy are to be found in culture and in character . To fail to see this is to go on dividing the world falsely between guilty producers and innocent consumers . The planetary versions ? the heroic versions ? of our problems have attracted great intelligence . Our problems , as they are caused and suffered in our lives , our households , and our communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable exceptions . A few people have learned to do a few things better . But it is discouraging to reflect that , though we have been talking about most of our problems for decades , we are still mainly talking about them . The civil rights movement has not given us better communities . The women 's movement has not given us better marriages or better households . The environment movement has not changed our parasitic relation-N -r ship to nature . e have failed to produce new examples of good home and community economies , and we have nearly completed the destruction of the examples we once had . Without examples , we are left with theory and the bureaucracy and the meddling that come with theory . We change our principles , our thoughts , and our words , but these are changes made in the air . Our lives go on unchanged . For the most part , the subcultures , the countercultures , the dissenters , and the opponents continue mindlessly ? or perhaps just niii+47t To THE FL46 , READINGS 17 helplessly ? to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wastefulness , its dependencies , and its addictions . The old problem remains : How do you get intelligence out of an institution or an organization ? My small community in Kentucky has lived and dwindled for a century at least under the influence of four kinds of organizations : governments , corporations , schools , and churches ? all of which are distant ( either actually or in interest ) , centralized , and consequently abstract in their concerns . Governments and corporations ( except for employees ) have no presence in our community at all , which is perhaps fortunate for us , but we nevertheless feel the indifference or the contempt of governments and corporations for communities such as ours . We have had no school of our own for nearly thirty years . The school system takes our young people , prepares them for " the world of tomorrow , " which it does not expect to take place in any rural area , and gives back expert ( that is , extremely generalized ) ideas . The church is present in the town . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their denominations , for almost a century , to provide training and income for student ministers , who do not stay long enough even to become disillusioned . For a long time , then , the minds that have most influenced our town have not been of the town and so have not tried even to perceive , much less to honor , the good possibilities that are there . They have not wondered on what terms a good and conserving life might be lived there . In this , my community is not unique but is like almost every other neighborhood in our country and in the " developed " world . The question that must be addressed , therefore , is not how to care for the planet but how to care for each of the planet 's millions of human and natural neighborhoods , each of its millions of small pieces and parcels of land , each one of which is in some precious way different from all the others . Our understandable wish to preserve the planet must somehow be reduced to the scale of our competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its humble households and neighborhoods . What can accomplish this reduction ? I will say again , without overweening hope but with certainty nonetheless , that only love can do it . Only love can bring intelligence out of the institutions and organizations , where it aggrandizes itself , into the presence of the work that must be done . Love is never abstract . It does not adhere to the universe or the planet or the nation or the institution or the profession but to the singular sparrows of the street , the lilies of the field , " the least of these my brethren . " Love is not , by its own desire , heroic . It is heroic only when compelled to be . It exists by its willingness to be anonymous , humble , and unrewarded . The older love becomes , the more clearly it understands its involvement in partiality , imperfection , suffering , and mortality . Even so , it longs for incarnation . It can live no longer by thinking . And yet to put on flesh and do the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Kipling , George Orwell wrote : " All left-wing parties in the highly industrialized countries are at bottom a sham , because they make it their business to fight against something which they do not really wish to destroy . They have internationalist aims , and at the same time they struggle to keep up a standard of life with which those aims are incompatible . We all live by robbing Asiatic coolies , and those of us who are ' enlightened ' all maintain that those coolies ought to be set free ; but our standard of living , and hence our ' enlightenment , ' demands that the robbery shall continue . " This statement of Orwell 's is clearly applicable to our situation now ; all we need to do is change a few nouns . The religion and the environmentalism of the highly industrialized countries are at bottom a sham , because they make it their business to fight against something that they do not really wish to destroy . We all live by robbing nature , but our standard of living demands that the robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skills to live much poorer than we do . We must waste less . We must do more for ourselves and each other . It is either that or continue merely to think and talk about changes that we are inviting catastrophe to make . The great obstacle is simply this : the conviction that we can not change because we are dependent upon what is wrong . But that is the addict 's excuse , and we know that it will not do . How dependent , in fact , are we ? Flow dependent are our neighborhoods and communities ? Flow might our dependences be reduced ? To answer these questions will require better thoughts and better deeds than we have been capable of so far . We must have the sense and the courage , for example , to see that the ability to transport food for hundreds or thousands of miles does not necessarily mean that we are well off . It means that the food supply is more vulnerable and more costly than a local food supply would be . It means that consumers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they are at the mercy of the people who have the control and influence . It means that , in eating , people are using large quantities of petroleum that other people in another time are almost certain to need . I am trying not to mislead you , or myself , about our situation . I think that we have hardly begun to realize the gravity of the mess we are in . Our most serious problem , perhaps , is that we have become a nation of fantasists . We believe , apparently , in the infinite availability of finite resources . We persist in land-use methods that reduce the potentially infinite power of soil fertility to a finite quantity , which we then proceed to waste as if it were an infinite quantity . We have an economy that depends not upon the quality and quantity of necessary goods and services but on the behavior of a few stockbrokers . We believe that democratic freedom can be preserved by people ignorant of the history of democracy and indifferent to the responsibilities of freedom . Our leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangers of their time as were George III and Lord North . They believe that the difference between war and peace is still the overriding political difference ? when , in fact , the difference has diminished to the point of insignificance . How would you describe the difference between modem war and modern industry ? between , say , bombing and strip mining , or between chemical warfare and chemical manufacturing ? The difference seems to be only that in war the victimization of humans is directly intentional and in industry it is " accepted " as a " trade-off " Were the catastrophes of Love Canal , Bhopal , Chernobyl , and the Exxon Valdez episodes of war or of peace ? They were , in fact , peacetime acts of aggression , intentional to the extent that the risks were known and ignored . We are involved unremittingly in a war not against " foreign enemies " but against the world , against our freedom , and indeed against our existence . Our so-called industrial accidents should be looked upon as revenges of Nature . We forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she imposes conditions of her own . Now she is plainly saying to us : " If you put the fates of whole communities or cities or regions or ecosystems at risk in single ships or factories or power plants , then I will furnish the drunk or the fool or the imbecile who will make the necessary small mistake . " And so , graduates , my advice to you is simply my hope for us all : Beware the justice of Nature . Understand that there can be no successful human economy apart from Nature or in defiance of Nature . Understand that no amount of education can overcome the innate limits of human intelligence and responsibility . We are not smart enough or conscious enough or alert enough to work responsibly on a gigantic scale . In making things always bigger and more centralized , we make them both more vulnerable in themselves and more dangerous to everything else . Learn , therefore , to prefer small-scale elegance and generosity to large-scale greed , crudity , and glamour . Make a home . Help to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put the interest of the community first . Love your neighbors ? not the neighbors you pick out , but the ones you have . Love this miraculous world that we did not make , that is a gift to us . As far as you are able make your lives dependent upon your local place , neighborhood , and household ? which thrive by care and generosity ? and independent of the industrial economy , which thrives by damage . Find work , if you can , that does no damage . Enjoy your work . Work well .
