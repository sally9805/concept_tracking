Baring his teeth in a dazzling ear-to-ear grin , the 26-year-old king of comedy from Hempstead , L.I. , playfully cuffs his fellow show-business icons . He locates a pompous prude lurking beneath Bill Cosby ' s avuncular joviality and finds a thin-skinned hysteric inside Richard Pryor ' s hipster . With vicious accuracy , he impersonates effeminate homosexuals , macho Italian-Americans and middle-class white managerial types. // As a needler of celebrities and a supercilious social parodist , Mr. Murphy is not all that different from the Bob Hope of 30 years ago who tweaked celebrity egos and lisped with a limp wrist . He has the same impeccably measured timing , the same impenetrable killer ' s smile , the same cool , monarchal self-confidence . But while their similarities go deep , their differences are far more profound . Mr. Murphy , for one , is black . If he possesses Bob Hope ' s imperial suavity , he is also the proud heir of a decades-old burlesque-show tradition of scatological party humor that Redd Foxx and others were instrumental in bringing into the mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Carlin were key figures in intellectually legitimizing this blue humor , And , preceding Mr. Murphy , Richard Pryor grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and elevated it into perilous , pyrotechnical art. // While aggressive , scatological humor has been a staple of American comedy for decades , its above-ground acceptance has reached a new plateau in the last few years . As Mr. Murphy has been swept to the pinnacle of entertainment , older comedians like Rodney Dangerfield have been discovered and embraced by youthful audiences who grew up with hard-rock music and have found in Mr. Dangerfield ' s crude , roaring hostility the comic equivalent of leering heavy-metal rock. // Mr. Dangerfield , who owns a popular New York comedy club , has fathered a whole school of screamingly profane , assaultive male comedians , among them Sam Kinison , Andrew ( Dice ) Clay and Bob Goldthwait . Their phenomenal popularity in the comedy world is comparable to that of Ozzy Osbourne and the Beastie Boys in rock music . Heavy-metal rock has often been called " head-banging music " because it expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outrageous " attack comedy " voices the same sense of pent-up frustration with no outlet other than wanton verbal aggression . An indispensable conduit to its success has been cable television , which has brought uncensored live comedy performances into millions of homes across the country. // The basic tenet of outrageous comedy , as announced by Redd Foxx , who made a brief , sad appearance on Broadway a few months ago , is that all people are equal in their bodily functions , animal desires and revulsions . In his wild-eyed freewheeling confessions , Mr. Pryor transcendently carried this concept into social and metaphysical realms . Mr. Murphy , who grew up worshiping Mr. Pryor , has synthesized his idol ' s ghetto-wise truth-telling , graphic language and sexual explicitness with Mr. Hope ' s toastmaster style . He epitomizes the contemporary stand-up comedian as both naughty pop philosopher and glib superstar. // The 66-year-old Mr. Dangerfield , who stands one rung below Mr. Murphy in popularity , recently sold out a two-week engagement at the Mark Hellinger Theater on Broadway . The generous mentor to a veritable brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring his comic resentment about his own ordinariness and striking a deep common chord. // A walking textbook of macho anxieties , he barks a hilarious , profane litany of complaints about failing sexual powers , ungovernable bodily functions and physical self-loathing . His hostile exterior only partly conceals irrepressible youthful ebullience . Mr. Dangerfield may be Mr. Murphy ' s senior by 40 years , but his audience is the same age . It is a rock-and-roll audience. // Oddly enough , the actual material that Mr. Dangerfield delivers tends to be formulaic fare descended from a shopworn school of mother-in-law and " take my wife , please " jokes . But spiced with profanity , it acquires a fresh edge of excitement . With his pugilist ' s mug , huge saucer eyes that snap instantaneously back and forth between wonder and resentment , and foul-mouthed roar , he suggests a proto-heavy-metal rock star , punching out hostility like a bullying drill instructor . As the jabs come thicker and faster in rising , precisely timed crescendos of aggression , his performance takes on a visceral musical charge. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comedy was a strategic ingredient in the liberal crusade for freedom of expression . Today , years after that crusade was won , the same language , only rougher , has become a key factor in what has been called " attack humor . " When heckled , Mr. Dangerfield gleefully smears his opponents to the wall . But his most provocative proteges are even more aggressive than he . Sam Kinison , who had his own Home Box Office special , " Breaking the Rules , " last year , escalates his mentor ' s growls into primal screams that punctuate an act obsessed with sex , especially of the oral variety . Dressed as a derelict crank street preacher , Mr. Kinison looks and sounds like Mickey Rooney as an ex-hippie on the skids . And on occasion he stomps recklessly into territory where few dare tread . Addressing the AIDS crisis , he allows that he " has nothing against the gay life style , " then lets loose with a primal howl . " Thanks , guys - thanks for giving us the black plague of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothin ' Goes Right , " Mr. Dangerfield ' s latest Home Box Office special , in which he presents several of his favorite young comedians , the Brooklyn comic Andrew ( Dice ) Clay matches Mr. Kinison in grossness . Affecting full black leather regalia , Mr. Clay parodies a macho hoodlum who responds to his girlfriend ' s pleas for tender sexual foreplay by snarling , " Honey , didn ' t I smack you around already today ? " He also carries to new extremes a strain of xenophobia that runs through the Dangerfield school of comedy . Frustrated by not being able to make himself understood to the Asians who work in 24-hour markets , he roars , " What they should have is one big sign at the airport that says if you don ' t know the language , get out of the country ! " // The most interesting comic screamer - and the only one to talk politics - is Bob Goldthwait , who has appeared in several " Police Academy " movies and is fiercely anti-Reagan . Not a Dangerfield protege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horrifying trivia ( " I saw on the news that a Twinkie has so many chemicals in it that it has a shelf life of 20 years ! " ) and prone to bizarre speculation . " Elvis Presley didn ' t have to die , " he screams . " That man was so rich he didn ' t have to take drugs - he could have paid people to perform hallucinations for him. " // " I can legally kill anyone I want , " Mr. Goldthwait boasts . " I really don ' t think there ' s a court in the world that wouldn ' t say I was insane at the time of the crime. " // Viewed in the wider context of American popular culture , the arm of stand-up comedy that mocks , screams and curses without any overt political or intellectual justification is a reflection of a broader trend . It is really just another extension of an adolescent culture of grossness that has become entrenched throughout the popular arts since the advent of heavy-metal arena rock in the early 1970 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies by everything from the teen-age gore of " Friday the 13th " to the prurience of " Porky ' s , " to the muscle-bound , blood-splattering escapades of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. // The humorous reveling in comic carnage for its own sake is a cornerstone of this adolescent-oriented culture . This mood is fueled by television ' s bombarding everyone with frustrating fantasies of instant gratification . But on a deeper level , the culture of grossness may also be a collective response to an increasingly ugly and polluted urban environment . The flaunting of an excremental vocabulary unavoidably reflects a landscape fouled with automobile junkyards , gas stations , fast-food restaurants , poisoned rivers and sludgy beaches. // Along with disgust , much outrageous humor carries an aura that might be described as curdled hipness . During the 60 ' s and 70 ' s , when comedy , like rock music , devoted much of its energy to exposing and assaulting the hypocrisy of what was seen as a warmongering , sexually repressed establishment culture , the young liberal audience for " hip " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women ' s movements , the sexual revolution and the use of mind-altering drugs were assumed to be good . The Vietnam War , nuclear weapons , corporate greed , racial prejudice and sexual prudishness were thought bad . In the 70 ' s , as this anti-establishment , college-educated generation of baby boomers began taking the reins of popular culture , " hip " comedy reached its golden age on " Saturday Night Live " and in the pages of The National Lampoon. // But as the political climate turned more conservative and materialistic and as countercultural dreams either faded or turned into nightmares , hip irreverence soured into cynicism , and the wink in the eye of comedy ' s cutting edge became a sneer . What distinguishes comedy that is cathartically instructive because it airs and laughs at sensitive subjects from comedy that bashes its subjects and reinforces divisive social prejudices ? // Eddie Murphy is the perfect symbol of post-hip , survival-of-the-fittest humor . The cool , unblinkingly cynical portrayal of sexual relationships that forms the core material of " Raw " is certainly " liberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his vision of the bedroom as a psychic battleground is chillingly " post-hip . " Mr. Murphy declares bluntly that most men are cheaters and most women schemers in a never-ending power struggle . The key to male supremacy , he maintains , is sexual performance . After a woman experiences one good orgasm , he suggests , " no matter what you do wrong , as long as you say I ' m sorry , she will listen to your story. " // Humorously exaggerated though they may be , Mr. Murphy ' s observations are offered as the basic brute facts of erotic life . The only moral he chooses to draw is personal . It is unfair for the ex-wives of wealthy stars like Johnny Carson - and anyone he himself might want to marry - to walk off with half of their husband ' s property. // While the field of comedy has accepted women in greater numbers than ever before , it is worth noting that the outrageous wing that includes Mr. Murphy and Mr. Dangerfield is totally male dominated . While many mainstream female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamers and cursers . Joan Rivers , the country ' s most popular female comic , is catty but prudish . Judy Tenuta , one of the fastest-rising woman comics , expresses plenty of hostility toward men , whom she derisively labels " stud puppets . " But while Ms. Tenuta ' s tirades have a feisty edge , they are delivered by a kooky invented character who wears a tattered prom dress , speaks in stylized growls and shrieks , totes an accordion and greets the audience , " Hi , pigs. " // Roseanne Barr , a hefty , gum-popping housewife and mother of three , minces no words in commenting on everything from child rearing and housework to married life , but her basic attitude is more tough live-and-let-live than it is hostile . Sandra Bernhard , a brilliant maverick , has a quicksilver temperament that changes from free-floating hostility to melting tenderness . But the androgynous Ms. Bernhard is not bawdy in the manner of 50 ' s female comedians like Belle Barth and Rusty Warren , who assessed the sexual combat zone as lustily as as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrier women , rather than fight back , would rather withdraw from the fray to a chilly distance. // Outrageous comedy , it should be remembered , is merely the trendiest genre in an incredibly rich and diverse field . When creating their own humor rather than playing roles in films , Lily Tomlin and Billy Crystal perform character comedy of exquisite refinement and compassion . If they continue to develop their considerable talents , up-and-coming performers , like Danitra Vance , Jeffrey Essmann and the female duo Kathy &; Mo , may one day inherit their mantles . Jim Morris , the young political humorist who impersonates Ronald Reagan so perfectly that he can extemporize in the language and tone of the President , is a mimic whose talents will certainly transcend the current Administration . Jackie Mason ' s socially observant Catskills-honed humor has proven remarkably durable . Steven Wright has pioneered a whole mini-genre with his absurdist non sequiturs. // Meanwhile major mainstream talents like Robin Williams , Steve Martin and Albert Brooks are in the creative prime of careers in which the roles of comedian , actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fruitfully interwoven. // Stand-up comedians long ago adopted a chillingly succinct vocabulary to describe success or failure with an audience . You either kill or you die . Increasingly in today ' s Darwinian social climate , a comedian ' s killing doesn ' t simply mean making bringing down the house but lashing out at a convenient target . Those who can ' t take the heat , it is assumed , should just stay out of the kitchen. // Could it be that all the curses and roars are really just a desperate attempt to shout down a collective fear of social breakdown and worse times ahead ? Are we being warned to toughen up for tougher times ? Or are those times already here ? If so , what the racket is telling us is that we do indeed live in a dog-eat-dog jungle , taking whatever laughter we can find while wallowing in the mess we ' ve made. //
