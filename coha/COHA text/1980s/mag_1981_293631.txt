At $100 a ticket , Nicholas Nickleby is a bargain : 81/2 solid hours of magic <P> Mr. Curdle ( rearing back in astonishment ) : Four shillings for one play ? <P> Nicholas : Well , with quite a lot of people in it . And it is very long . <P> Mr. Curdle : It had better be . <P> Start with the money . One hundred dollars will buy you one sleeve of a Halston ultrasuede jacket , dinner for two at a Manhattan restaurant or tickets to three conventional Broadway shows . It will also get you into the Royal Shakespeare Company 's The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby , whose first preview performances last week helped launch the new Broadway season . In terms of time and money spent , this sprawling , tumultuous , 8-hour adaptation of Charles Dickens ' 1839 novel is the theatrical bargain of the decade . One off-Broadway musical - five lively actors , 70 easy minutes , the audience seated in chairs designed by a Bauhaus sadist-costs the playgoer 230 a minute . A full day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each pair of dimes you get another generous , nourishing slice of instant cultural history . Most Broadway shows offer a pleasant enough diversion between sunset and bed ; Nickleby will become part of your organism , cast a glow for years to come . So sell the Atari , skip a mortgage payment , pawn the children . <P> Money can not often buy the experience that Nickleby provides . But for the next 14 weeks , $100 will . <P> Rarely has a show landed on Broadway amid such anticipation , fanfare and - so far as the ticket price is concerned - controversy . Just as the Nickleby marquee over the Plymouth Theater dominates Manhattan 's West 45th Street , so the R.S.C. production seems sure to set the tone and standard for this season and many to come . It arrives not only as a certified London smash and perhaps a historic theatrical phenomenon but also as a prepackaged television spectacular : the entire performance has been taped for showing as a four-part miniseries on a syndication network in February 1983 so that viewers all across the U.S. will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare stage surrounded by low-tech scaffolding that rises to the rafters and rings the balcony , the R.S.C. tells this 800-page story of a young innocent in the first years of Victoria 's reign . The company 's 39 actors essay upwards of 250 roles , from weak-willed aristocrat to poor heroic cripple . The play dives into Dickensian bathos , preposterous coincidences , abrupt reversals of fortune , the collision of improbable goodness with impossible evil-and emerges triumphant , soaring with spirit . In the process it displays the grandest theatrical techniques , affirms the Tightness of love and friendship , revives pleasures and poignancies that have all but vanished from modern narrative art . At a time when Broadway is as busy and financially flush as it has been in decades ( see following story ) , the coming of Nickleby demonstrates that it can also accommodate the highest quality . The R.S.C. has fashioned an epic of feeling and intelligence - a vertiginous celebration of life upon the splendid stage .                 @ @ @ @
