ROMANCE LANGUAGE by Peter Parnell <P> Last night Walt Whitman had the strangest dream . There he was , staring out his bedroom window , when who should hop in but Huck Finn , itching to travel . " Dress warmly , " Walt 's dead mom told him . And we 're off to see Louisa May Alcott , who 's having an affair with a Tahitian prince . Over there 's Charlotte Cushman , the noted actress , playing Hamlet to Emily Dickinson 's Ophelia ; they become co-stars and lovers . Old Ralph Waldo Emerson is having a chat with the dead Henry David Thoreau : " Sex can be messy ; art ca n't . That 's why I 've always preferred it . " Then just about everyone shows up in Montana , where Louisa falls for General George Armstrong Custer , and Charlotte dallies with a Dietrichesque saloon singer who is really a man . They all die at Little Big Horn and go to heaven . And in the wink of a REM , the dream is over . <P> Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallucinatory steam only when the night is half over . But at full throttle , Playwright Parnell 's mixture of historical figures and fanciful situations makes a genial noise . This is the land of vaudeville revisionism previously charted by Indians , Travesties and Cloud 9 , where social satire speaks in the vocabulary of dreams-the mind 's own romance language . It is a pleasure to see Cynthia Harris ( Charlotte ) , Valerie Mahaffey ( Emily ) and the 19 other cast members cavort so merrily on the tabletop stage of Manhattan 's Playwrights Horizons Theater , complementing the grandeur of Parnell 's vision with the grandiosity of their performances . As Walt might have proclaimed , Dream big , boys and girls ! And dream on . <P> - By Richard Corliss
