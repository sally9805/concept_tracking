Every time a paroxysm of black unrest grips South Africa , followed by a crackdown by the white government of State President P.W . Botha , statesmen and politicians in Western capitals begin asking , Is there a way , any way short of military action for the world to force Pretoria to change its racial policies ? Last week , as South Africa 's current state of emergency entered its third week , the debate flared once more . Its focus : whether recent events require a major step-up in economic sanctions against South Africa , and whether such pressure would really contribute to banishing apartheid . <P> The week 's discussions centered in the Hague , where leaders of the twelve members of the European Community met to ponder the subject . In the end , they settled for weaker recommendations than many observers had expected . They called on South Africa to release Black Leader Nelson Mandela , who has been in prison for 24 years , and to lift its ban on the African National Congress , the country 's oldest black political organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against the Pretoria regime from nearby Zambia . <P> The E.C . decided that after Britain takes over the presidency of the organization for six months beginning July 1 , British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe will visit South Africa in the hope of establishing a dialogue between the country 's government officials and black leaders . The Europeans also declared that in three months they will decide on " further measures " that might be needed , including a ban on new investments in South Africa and a curb on the import of South African coal , iron and steel , and gold coins . <P> The West European leaders might have felt more urgency had South Africa been sputtering out of control .

Out of an estimated 3,000 arrested since the emergency was declared on June 12 , about 1,200 were thought to have been released . In a separate development , treason charges against four black trade unionists were dropped after the judge ruled that taped evidence appeared to have been tampered with . <P> In addition to a CBS cameraman who had already left the country , two more journalists were expelled : Richard Manning , the Newsweek bureau chief in Johannesburg , and Dan Sagir , an Israeli who represented the newspaper Ha'aretz . From Amnesty International , the London-based human rights organization , came reports of three more raids on black churches and the detention of entire congregations . Amnesty International also reported that Zwelakhe Sisulu , a black South African editor and member of a prominent activist family , had been arrested .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
