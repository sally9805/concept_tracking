DAVID MAINSE : " 100 HUNTLEY STREET " helicopter climbed slowly above a barren African plateau . David Mainse , the big man in the copilot 's seat , checked his watch . In just 12 minutes the craft would land with the last shipment of the day  --  another ton and a half of grain for a starving tribe in central Sudan . The trip over jagged terrain would have taken three days by truck . Mainse relaxed . He had come a third of the way around the world to make sure his promise to televi sion viewers was being kept . For three months , he had . invoked prayer for African job had one drawback : Some local boys were content to remain in the middle grades until they reached 17 , when they would no longer be required to attend school . A rowdy lot , they had just chucked the principal out the window , and the district school inspector was counting on young Mainse to be a " settling influence . " Entering his classroom for the first time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm-wrestling contest in the back of the room . Walking up to them , " Mr. Mainse " took off his coat and challenged the victor to a similar duel . The boy , the son of a freight-yard boss , grinned and winked at his friends . He was at least as large as the new teacher As Mainse gripped the boy 's hand , he said a silent prayer of gratitude for every 80-pound bale he had thrown , every tree he had felled , every blocking sled he had hit . The boy , cheered on by his friends , applied maximum pressure for a quick put-down . Sweat beaded on Mainse ' brow as he held the boy off . The young teacher soon realized he would win , but instead of quickly forcing the boy 's arm back , he allowed the battle to continue for a time . Only Mainse ' opponent was aware that his teacher had secretly allowed him to save face . Mainse had no trouble with discipline after that . The best thing about that semester , however , happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school Mainse had started . Mainse ' success as a teacher and a preacher persuaded him to go to Bible college . There he met a petite brunette , Norma-Jean Rutledge . They were married in 1958 , while he was still in college . After his ordination , their first assignment was to build a church in another Ontario town even farther north : Deep River . In 1962 , television was mak-ing its way into northern On-tario ; Mainse believed he could use this new medium in his ministry . The nearest stu-dio , in Pembroke , 42 miles south , agreed to give him 15 minutes on Sat-urday night , after the eleven o'clock news from Toronto . It would cost him $55 ? more than two weeks sal-ary ! Nevertheless , certain of God 's guidance , he decided to take the risk . A trio called the King 's Men ( two of whom were Norma-Jean 's brothers ) started off the first show . They were followed by a brief but powerful presentation of the gospel . Afterward , the station received so many calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular feature . By far the most gratifying response , however , was a phone call that awakened the young preacher at 5:00 a.m . Sunday . He knew the caller , a Deep River man named Harry with a drinking problem about to destroy his marriage and break up his family . Harry , his voice cracking with emotion , said he had watched the program and given his life to Christ . He would be in church that morning to tell people what had happened . That call was the beginning of David Mainse ' television ministry . It long remained secondary to his pas-wring , but it continued to grow , first to two half-hour programs a week ? " Crossroads " and a new program for children , " Circle Square . " Finally , in 1976 , Mainse decided to risk everything and to go into full-time daily Christian television . The show 's format  --  guests , musicians , and a phone bank for two-way communication  --  would resemble the " 700 Club " in the States , but it would have its own distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a studio in an old gymnasium , under lighting that came on less than two minutes before air time , the first telecast of " 100 Huntley Street " went on the air . Mainse winces when he sees reruns of that first attempt . Everything that could go wrong , did , including a stagehand backing slowly into the range of the only camera still functioning . At one point , the shooting script became such a shambles that Mainse called out to his wife , scheduled to sing later : " Wing it , Norma-Jean ! " ? ? ? Today , " 100 Huntley Street " productions are among the smoothest and most innovative done anywhere , and its programing for young people has won numerous awards . ( One thing has not changed : Every morning at five , David Mainse keeps the promise he made to God at the outset . For each minute he spends on camera , he devotes a minute beforehand to solitary prayer in his private office . ) Initially , some Canadian pastors were skeptical of this home-grown television evangelist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers in Canada and its nationwide center for the United States in Rockford , Illinois , have received more than a million calls . Countless lives have been renewed , marriages saved , and families restored . Indeed , almost every pastor within viewing range can point to at least one or two new families in his congregation as a result of " 100 Huntley Street . " Yet Mainse still receives criticism , especially from the secular media . Recently , during a guest appearance on a Canadian Broadcasting Company talk show , he was accused of paying himself a huge salary and of accepting lavish corporation perquisites  --  a house , a fancy car , and so forth . But his adversary had made a mistake in trying to blind-side this former lineman . Mainse calmly declared that he lives in a modest apartment , drives a five-year-old car , and earns less than the cameramen who film him . And he offered to produce his most recent tax return to prove it . CCCI is supported solely by contributions , yet few ministries in Canada ( or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the buck . The corporation has developed multilingual shows in 15 languages besides English . They include " Signs of the Times " for the deaf . The most widely seen are , of course , the French " Au 100 Tuple " and the Italian " Vivere Al 100 Per Cento . " The latter , meaning " 100 Percent Living , " was originally intended for Toronto 's Italian-Canadians , whose numbers surpass the combined populations of Pisa and Venice . Today the show is broadcast to more than 60 Italian cities , including the two mentioned . No one guessed , at first , the eventual ramifications of foreign-language programing  --  until Mainse became concerned about modern Europe 's desperate need for a strong affirmation of moral , family-oriented values . He was stunned to learn that only 5 Europeans in 100 go to church and that even fewer have a personal relationship with God . Television evangelism was an obvious solution , but Mainse chose not to simply buy air time and export old " 100 Huntley Street " telecasts . CCCI 's multilingual programing experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be suitable for English , Canadians , and Americans might be decidpean country originate their own television programing . And so , for the past three years , dozens of young European trainees have been coming to 100 Huntley Street to receive a six-month crash course in everything from basic production to lighting to electronic maintenance . The result : Christian production centers are now in place in Italy , Denmark , Sweden , Switzerland , West Germany , and Austria , and more countries are on the way . Although the European Christian television groups are grateful for the help of " 100 Huntley Street , " they are most pleased that the Toronto headquarters have made no attempt to control them . When CCCI recently donated a mobile television production unit and a master control center for satellite up-link , it stipulated only that the unit be made available to the Danes , the Swedes , the Germans , or whoever else might have urgent need of it . Being the catalyst for European Christian television is hardly the first new ground Mainse has broken . Five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
