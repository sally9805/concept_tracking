As Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi emerged from the President 's House in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo last week , he had reason to smile . The previous day the Prime Minister had signed an agreement with Sri Lankan President Junius R. Jayewardene that promised to end a brutal civil war . But as Gandhi passed the white-uniformed men of a Sri Lankan naval honor guard , one of the sailors broke ranks and swung at Gandhi with the butt of his rifle . The Prime Minister caught a glancing blow in the back and stumbled . Guards quickly hustled Gandhi away and hauled off the bellicose sailor . <P> As it turned out , Rajiv Gandhi was not injured . Nonetheless , the attack was a painful reminder to the Prime Minister of how much strife and distrust had been aroused by the pact he had just initialed  --  and how uncertain were its chances of success . For four years Sri Lanka , a teardrop of an island off India 's southern coast , has been plagued by a vicious battle that has claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority Tamils , the conflict has not only imperiled Jayewardene 's government but threatened to drag New Delhi further into a war that it wanted to see end . <P> The agreement was worked out during three weeks of secret talks between New Delhi and Colombo . Its centerpiece was Jayewardene 's concession of local rule in two provinces heavily populated by Tamils , who make up one-eighth of the country 's 16 million people . In exchange Gandhi , whose country is home to about 50 million Tamils and who has provided refuge and arms to Tamil insurgents fighting the Colombo government , promised to ensure that the rebels would lay down their arms . <P> The day after the signing ceremony , some 3,000 Indian troops landed on the Tamil-dominated Jaffna peninsula in the north of the island . Their task : to disarm the guerrillas and take up peacekeeping duties . Those efforts promised + to be tricky ; the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , the largest and most militant of five rebel groups , insisted that they would not consider disarming until New Delhi released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house arrest in New Delhi after calling the pact a " stab in the back , but early this week Prabakaran was released and returned to Jaffna after pledging that he would ask his commanders to disarm . <P> Jayewardene had already announced a request for " military assistance " from the U.S. , Britain , Pakistan and China to help " suppress a revolt against the democratically elected government . " U.S. officials indicated that some " logistical support " might be forthcoming but that there would be no direct military aid . <P> For their part , Sinhalese protesters took to the streets even before the agreement was signed . Columns of black smoke rose over the capital as police and soldiers resorted to rifle fire to contain the rioting . By week 's end at least 70 people were dead . In the protesters ' eyes , Jayewardene had caved in to rebel demands and Indian pressure . Admitted a government official : " Ninety percent of the Sinhalese people are against us.
