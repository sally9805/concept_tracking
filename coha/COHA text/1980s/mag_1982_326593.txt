An Illinois town says no to handguns <P> <P> For years Congress has avoided passing even modest gun registration measures , wary of incurring the well-financed wrath of shooters ' groups like the National Rifle Association . But the town fathers of Morton Grove , Ill. ( pop . 24,000 ) , a genteel suburb northwest of Chicago , are not so timorous . Beginning next Monday , selling or possessing a handgun in Morton Grove will be a crime , punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine . The law against possession , passed 4 to 2 by the village trustees and upheld by a federal district court , is the most stringent gun control statute in the U.S. <P> Authorities are counting on voluntary compliance . Morton Grove police are not launching an enforcement drive . Handgun enthusiasts could easily circumvent the law anyway by buying and storing their weapons in neighboring towns . Gun clubs and collectors of antique pistols are exempt from the ban . Indeed , Village Trustee Don Sneider knows that the effect of the legislation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ca n't change society , " he says . " But we 're making waves . " <P> Indeed they are . Seven nearby suburbs are considering similar laws , and in Chicago , Mayor Jane Byrne has proposed a measure effectively prohibiting ownership of new handguns . <P> The N.R.A . is predictably alarmed , calling the Morton Grove bans " the most dangerous attack ever staged against the right to keep and bear arms . " The 2 million-member group and a smaller gun lobby based in Washington State have financed four lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the ownership prohibition . But the village government is sticking to its guns , mounting court defenses of the law with the help of a $15,000 subsidy from the National Coalition to Ban Handguns . <P> The antihandgun sentiment in Morton Grove was latent until an entrepreneur announced last spring that he was opening a gun shop in town . That prospect galvanized the trustees . " I 'm just against guns , " says Sneider . " It 's a deep conviction of mine . " Says fellow Village Trustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was sick and tired of reading about handgun deaths . " Three years ago , a pair of local teenage girls were murdered in a Morton Grove woods , both shot to death with a handgun . <P> <P> As Morton Grove goes , so goes Illinois ? Not exactly . Even as the village was joining the U.S. gun control vanguard , the state legislature enacted a law permitting private ownership of machine guns . Governor James Thompson signed the bill , but soon realized it was " an error , " and won an amendment again outlawing machine guns . That farcical episode in the state capitol will surely be eclipsed by the enduring legislative example set in Morton Grove 's village meeting room . In fact , Morton Grove 's stand on handguns may become legend : ABC has paid the town $17,000 for the option to make a TV movie about the crusaders from Morton Grove .
