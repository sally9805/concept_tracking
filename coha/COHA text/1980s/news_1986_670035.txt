American AIDS researchers acknowledged an embarrassing gaffe that their French competitors vow will hurt the Americans ' case in U.S. Patent Court . Robert C. Gallo and colleagues at the National Cancer Insititute said that their landmark 1984 article on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus they named HTLV-III " inadvertently " was accompanied by an illustration of the virus LAV supplied by French scientists . The French immediately seized on the admission as evidence of what they have been claiming since they sued their American counterparts last year , charging the Americans had misappropriated research . The Americans say it was merely the case of a technician under deadline pressure choosing the wrong photograph from a file . The LAV virus was supplied to Dr. Gallo by archrival Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute . Dr. Gallo ' s original article was published in May 1984 in the journal Science amid great fanfare . A letter to the editor from Dr. Gallo ' s team correcting the caption is scheduled to appear in Science today . Dr. Gallo sees it as a tempest in a test tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific publishing . When a newspaper caption misidentifies a photo , a simple correction relegates the offense to the realm of typographical trivia . But in science , where you are what you publish , mistakes die hard . Moreover , AIDS research is a field polarized by political and proprietary battles over publishing priority and patent rights . Thus , mistakes could reverberate from the laboratory to the courtroom . The Pasteur Institute had sued the U.S. Public Health Service last December , charging that Dr. Gallo ' s AIDS research and a resultant patent were based upon the earlier work of Dr. Montagnier . At stake are not only acclaim , but royalties on sales of AIDS blood-test kits . Dr. Gallo , in an interview last week , characterized the misidentified photo as an unfortunate but insubstantial glitch that doesn ' t affect the content of his article . " It wasn ' t primary data , but an esthetic thing  --  an illustration , " he contended . " It was an accident . Nothing I ever did in the laboratory was ever knowingly wrong by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone interview from Paris yesterday , said the affair " confirms what Pasteur Institute has said before , that he used our virus as a standard , and that he used LAV for characterizing HTLV-III . " Although Dr. Gallo has long maintained the French virus sample was too small and too hard to grow to be useful , Dr. Montagnier said the incident shows his American counterpart was both growing and photographing the French virus . Why it took two years for the mistake to surface isn ' t fully clear , but differences in appearances of the two viruses are difficult for even a trained observer to detect . The mistake may have surfaced as researchers pored over documents to support conflicting claims in the case . Dr. Gallo said it is routine to photograph other scientists ' samples , adding : " What were we supposed to do with the virus ? Eat it ? " He said American scientists didn ' t promise not to study the French virus when they got it from the French , only to refrain from commercializing it . The photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus " budding , " or reproducing , under the powerful magnification of an electron microscope . The pictures weren ' t taken in Dr. Gallo ' s laboratory at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , but 40 miles away in the Frederick , Md. , laboratories of Program Resources Inc. a National Cancer Institute contractor . Matthew A. Gonda and Raymond Gilden , employees of the subcontractor who signed the letter to Science , couldn ' t be reached for an explanation of how the photo mistake happened . But Dr. Gallo and the cancer institute said it was a combination of deadline pressure and innocent but uncomprehending technicians . " I said to Gonda , ' Make a composite ( picture ) , ' " Dr. Gallo recalled . " The paper was in press . I said , ' Don ' t use any of the HTLV-III ( pictures ) from prior publications . Then Gonda got sick . A technician goes to the file and selects a picture of an LAV bud , cuts it out , blows it up . Gonda comes back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved didn ' t know what " LAV " meant . The cancer institute press office said yesterday that such photos were only marked with a code number , not names . Angrily branding the affair an artificial controversy , Dr. Gallo said : " It ' s of no consequence . If it were any other field , without the dirtiness this involves , I wouldn ' t be spending ten seconds on this . " Attempting to sound a conciliatory note , Dr. Montagnier said , " It is good of ( Dr. Gallo ) to acknowledge that a mistake was made . " But he also said the French will use the incident to try to bolster their position in court . Commenting on the affair , Nobel laureate Howard Temin of the University of Wisconsin said , " The patent dispute has nothing to do with science and nothing to do with the ( AIDS ) epidemic . Scientists are human beings and are as prone to mistakes as other human beings . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
