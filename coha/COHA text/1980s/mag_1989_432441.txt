 | It weighs 19 pounds , stands a foot high , and measures 16 inches in diameter . To install it all you do is plug it in . Yet this unassuming machine is a potent new weapon in the war against radon . Called the No-Rad , it grew out of research done at the Harvard School of Public Health by Dr. Edward Maher , Dr. Stephen Rudnick , and myself . Interestingly . it does not reduce the concentration of radon . But it greatly reduces the health hazard posed by radon . Indeed , we found that simply using a fan to circulate the air in a house can help do that . The EPA attributes 5,000 to 20,000 lung-cancer deaths each year to radon , a radioactive gas that is produced through the successive decay of uranium . But it is not the radon itself that harms the lungs . Though you may inhale the gas , it is inert and does not interact with body tissues . And its half-life is 3.8 days , so chances are you 'll exhale it before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactive particles are formed ? polonium , bismuth , and lead ? and these have half-lives ranging from just a few seconds to 30 minutes . Because they are solids , they tend to lodge in the lungs , and because they have short half-lives , they tend to decay there . At least 95 percent of the radiation dose to the lungs attributable to radon comes from these solids . Most methods for dealing with ra- don in houses are aimed at diluting its concentration , or preventing its entry in the first place . In houses with serious radon problems , radon-mitigation contractors may jackhammer the basement floor to install pipes below " Radon Revisited , " Sept. ' 87 . These are run to the outside and a fan is installed on the outlet to depressurize the area beneath the basement constantly . It 's a messy ? and often costly ? project . Clearing the air Ed Maher , a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who now directs a worldwide radon testing program for the Air Force , came to the Harvard School of Public Health for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radon is really from the solid decay products , Maher became intrigued with the notion of using air treatment to reduce the risk . Steve Rudnick , an aerosol physicist , and I were his faculty advisers . We first tried the obvious : filtration ( passing the radon-contaminated air through a highly efficient filter ) and electrostatic precipitation ( a process in which the air passes between two highly charged plates ) . We tested the devices in a 2,750-cubic-foot chamber ( about the size of three rooms in a house ) into which we can pipe radon , which we get from a chunk of radium . A fan blows air over the radium , and the air is distributed through perforated PVC pipes along the floor of the chamber . That mimics its diffusion into the basement of a house . Sensitive instruments measure the concentrations of radon and its decay products . As expected , both the filter and the electrostatic precipitator removed a high percentage of the airborne radon decay products . But when we analyzed the data we found a major surprise : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing the treated air . We traced this paradox to ? of all things ? too little dust in the air . Here 's why : When radon decays , it emits an alpha particle , which fires through the electron cloud of the radon atom , carrying electrons with it . That leaves the residual atom ? the decay product ? highly positively charged . Thus it immediately tends to attach to dust in the air . When you use an effective filter or electrostatic precipitator , not only do you remove many of the radon decay products , you also remove most of the dust . But the radon gas is still present and still producing decay products ? which have far fewer dust particles to which to attach . @#  | And that 's the problem : Atom for atom , an unattached radon decay product produces 3 to 40 times the radiation dose to the lungs as does an identical atom attached to dust . The unattached particles are chemically far more reactive . Also , a partial coating of dust keeps the attached particles from intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net result of air-cleaning devices can lead to as much as a doubling of the radiation dose to the lungs . It was a startling finding . Charging ahead Next we considered ways to capitalize on the charge carried by the radon decay products . If they could be brought into contact with room surfaces , we hypothesized , they might stick because of their charge . The radiation these particles emit has low penetrating power , so unless they decay in your lungs , they pose little hazard . First we put an ordinary box fan in our test chamber and turned on the radon machine . Instruments showed that the fan removed 50 to 60 percent of the decay products from the air . More important , when we analyzed the data , we found that the fan removed both attached and unattached radon decay products and reduced the dose to the lungs by an amount comparable to the reduction in the airborne concentration of the decay products . Buoyed by this success , we tried enhancing the charge with negative- and positive-ion generators . These ionize the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charged air would repel the charged decay products and expedite their movement toward room surfaces . We tested specially prepared ion generators in the laboratory chamber and found both to be effective , but not equally so . The negative-ion generator removed 65 to 70 percent of the radon decay products ; the positive-ion generator removed 80 to 85 percent . The reason , we suppose , is that the negative-ion generator has to overwhelm the positive charge on the decay products before it can have the desired effect . Finally , we tested combined approaches and came up with a winner : a ceiling fan plus a positive-ion generator . This combination removed 90 to 95 percent of the radon decay products in our laboratory tests . Analysis showed it would reduce the radiation dose to the lungs by 68 to 87 percent . Since our tests were published , scientists in Canada , Finland , Denmark , and the United Kingdom have confirmed our results . In 1986 , with the help of the university , we got a patent on the concept , and eventually licensed Ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No-Rad machine , a threespeed hassock fan that contains positive-ion generators . ( It also contains a negative-ion generator , but that was not our idea . Scott Gehlke , president of Ion Systems , insisted on including it because of the folklore that negative ions make you happy and positive ions depress you . ) We tested commercial models of the No-Rad in our laboratory and got dramatic results ( see graph ) . We also tested the machine in houses in Massachusetts and Connecticut . There we got decay-product removals in the range of 75 to 90 percent . Tests by the EPA are pending . Now we 're testing other configurations of these components , including two that would place everything between the studs within a wall . Preliminary tests show these schemes to be effective . What to do If your house has high concentrations of radon , you should consult recognized experts . But the vast major-  | ity of houses with radon problems have just a little too much ? and need just a little correction . The EPA recommends that the radon concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liter of air . If you monitor your house and find that it has up to double that amount , then simple circulation of the air will probably provide adequate protection . If you have ceiling fans , just turn them on slow speed and let them run . If you have a forced-air heating or cooling system , you can rig it so the air handler runs continuously instead of cycling . Almost any fan will help . If your house has radon concentrations of 5 to 10 times the recommended maximum , additional control measures are necessary . We think the No-Rad machine is the simplest solution . Ion Systems claims that one machine will cover a 300-square-foot area . Our tests suggest that is conservative : It should serve a larger area if there is good airflow . The machine ( list price $350 ) can be used independently or as supplement to other remedial measures . Ion Systems , Inc. , 2546 10th St. , Berkeley , Calif. 94710. @#                  @ @ @
