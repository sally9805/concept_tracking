An ambitious young British politician has a one-night fling with a prostitute , who then tries to blackmail him . When he refuses to pay , she tells her tale to the press . But the newspapers nobly refuse to print her story , and the politician goes on to become Prime Minister . <P> In fact , this is an episode in Jeffrey Archer 's First Among Equals , a 1984 best seller . But if truth is often stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it was for Archer , 46 , deputy chairman of the Conservative ! Party and the author of six top-selling novels , including Kane and Abel and the current best seller A Matter of Honor . Last week the Sunday News of the World ( circ. 4.8 million ) carried a five-page story claiming that Archer had offered Prostitute Monica Coghlan ( pounds ) 2,000 ( $2,800 ) to pay for a trip abroad to avoid scandal . The same day , Archer resigned the post to which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had appointed him a year earlier . <P> Archer , who is married and has two sons , maintained that he had never met Coghlan , much less had a relationship with her . " Foolishly , as I now realize , I allowed myself to fall into what I can only call a trap , " he said in a statement . He admitted , however , that he had been telephoned by a woman calling herself Debbie , who later turned out to be Coghlan . She said a client of hers was telling people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In later calls Coghlan said she was being hounded by reporters about the purported liaison . " In the belief that this woman genuinely wanted to be out of the way of the press , and realizing that any publicity of this kind would be extremely harmful to me , " Archer said , he offered the money . " For that lack of judgment , and that alone , I have tendered my resignation . " <P> The scandal-loving British press was gleeful , especially the News of the World . Its story included transcripts of phone conversations that had Archer suggesting that Coghlan wear a green leather suit and meet a friend of his at London 's Victoria Station . After accepting an envelope stuffed with ( pounds ) 50 notes in view of a long-lens camera , however , the woman returned it , telling both Archer 's envoy and a hidden microphone , " I ca n't keep running , can I ? " <P> The vicissitudes of Archer 's life have already been put to use in his novels . An Oxford student who in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had to resign five years later after bad investments left him near bankruptcy . He turned to writing , and loosely based his first novel , Not a Penny More , Not a Penny Less , on his experience . A main character in First Among Equals , who becomes Prime Minister in the considerably altered U.S. version , also suffers severe financial reverses . <P> By the time of Kane and Abel ( 1979 ) , Archer was out of debt and into fame . That brought him to the attention of Thatcher , who liked his novels and comeback success story . She tapped him for the party post , where he drew good crowds on the political circuit .
