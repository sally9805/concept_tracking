txt ONKS DO N'T usually do network TV . Not real monks . Real monks pray . Sometimes they bake bread , make jellies , raise sheep , but even when they 're at work , they 're at prayer , asking themselves questions about love , and peace , and surrender , and God  --  painful , personal questions that TV and the rest of us develop pimples trying to avoid . Monks ca n't avoid the Big Questions . They are drawn to them for reasons that are as much a part of life 's mystery as birth and death and the Nielsens . Trappist monks , for example , spend their lives in lovely monasteries , praying , working , studying , praying , working , studying , day after day , year after year , carrying on a Christian tradition of Meditation and contemplation that goes back . ' more than 800 years . Serious monks , even monks who like to snake jokes , have no time for TV , and commercial TV has certainly had no time for them . Certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THURSDAY NIGHT , on ABC 8:30 p.m. , Channel 71 , a " Cioseup " crew led by documentary producer , writer , director Helen Whitney takes us where we have never been before , behind the beautiful stone walls of the St. Joseph 's Abbey in Spencer , Mass , to meet and watch and listen to some of the 00 men who have chosen to live there as monks . Before the Second Vatican Council . 15 years ago , a show like this would never have happened . Before Vatican II , monks spoke In sign language or not at all , preferably not at all . The seclusion was extreme , the fasting intense , and total devotion the only path to the divine . Now monks have been , called on to go public , Ida sacred sense , to speak openly about love and trust and what community is all about . " The Monastery " is a fascinating show for many reasons , some having to do with the program itself  --  it 's beautifully done  --  and some having to do with why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obvious choice for a network news department , " says Pam Hill , whom Boone Arledge brought in to head the documentary film unit at ABC News 31b years ago . Since then , she 's distinguished herself and , " aoseup " with hard-nosed documentaries on ' crime , toxic waste , Northern Ireland , and the CIA , issues-oriented films that dealt directly with modern day turmoil . " The Monastery " Is clearly a retreat from those problems . , . or is it ? HILL EXPLAINED that ABC News went ahead with " The Monastery " for several reasons . For one , It had never been done before and " Closeup " producer Helen Whitney had been wanting to do something on monks for a long time . She 'd tried to get a monastery in Kentucky to let her in , but they were not happy dealing with TV , or women . The monks at St. Joseph 's were more open to Whitney 's proposal , and after they heard it and saw her two most recent films  --  one on homosexuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intrigued . They prayed // Once-silent monks open up impressively for TV 's ' Monastery ' // ' for guidance , voted , and decided that in the spirit of Vatican II they would open their doors to Whitney . And us . " It was extraordinary , " says Peggy Brim , the asseelate producer who essentially lived with the monks day and night sleeping elsewhere for two months . ' There was some tension at first , but after a while the most unbelievable level of intimacy and trust developed . There 'd never been women in the enclosure before . Oh , women Came to see the men take.vows , and once , I thinlc , Mother Theresa got a tour , but , we spent hours and hours and hours with them .... " And they were asking these men the most intimate ' questions imaginable . ' Who are you ? ' the women wanted to know . Why did you retreat to St. Joseph 's ? Do you ever doubt the existence of God ? . Are you ever afraid ? And what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S a wonderftd moment in the film when some younger 111,068 are lust sitting around , shooting the gospel , and one of them  --  Brother Andrew , a graduate of Dartmouth  --  admits that he missed sex so much , it took him two tries at St. Joseph 's before he could stay . " Everyone else was just cruising into celibacy , " he says , but not him , Everyone else was calm and serene while he ... was n't . That 's because the other brothersto  --  be were smart enough to wean themselves from women , slowly , before entering the monastery . Not Brother Andrew. - " I was dating right up to the last minute ! " he says , giggling like a schoolboy . " No one told mel " " Some of them had to learn how to talk again , " says Brim . " One cried , and said he had n't had a conversation like this with anyone in 25 years . " YOu 'd never know it to hear them speak . The monks that appear  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Beret , an M.I.T. engineer , and others  --  are remarkably clear , honest , and direct . At this point in their spiritual journey , it 's probably impossible for them to be otherwise . That 's what life in the monastery is all about , learning who you are and relating that , somehow , to questions that have tickled . men and women since time began . Questions of life and death , good  --  and evil , mystery and madness . The monks spend hours , years , lifetimes contemplating all of it . AND THAT HELPS explain why ABC News decided to take its cameras into this world to begin with . " There 's a genuine crisis of faith and spirituality in-the country , " says Pam Hill . She senses it , and her boas : Boone Arledge and his assistant David Burke agreed that millions of people in the country are searching for something , something that is missing from their every .. day life . Call it " a sense of the sacred " as the Abbott , does or morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the monks have some interesting clues on where to find it . And that 's why ABC News went to ABC corporate and fought to give " The Monastery " flo , minutes of prime time . " R seems to me these men have something to say to people who feel spiritually adrIft .. And what is that ? " Well , I 'm not a particularly religious person and I 'm certainly not Catholic but they are saying search . Search for your own higher , ' inner values . Do n't let your world be determined by th0 external values of money and position and power . Seek a higher inner counsel .... That 's what I get from it . " You may get something different from " The Monastery , " but it 's unlikely you 'll get nothing at all . Monks may not do a lot of TV but when they do  --  thank God and Helen Whitney  --  it 's really a blessing .                   @ @
