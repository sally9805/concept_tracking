 | Novelists Bret Easton Ellis and Tama Janowitz have two things in common . Both specialize in the lifestyles of the young and naughty and both have become celebrity stars . Chalk it up to chic decadence ? the appeal of a street-sassy rebelliousness . Two years ago Ellis ? then still a Bennington undergraduate ? scored with " Less Than Zero , " whose affectless prose detailed the sexual and pharmacological high jinks of rich college kids on Christmas break in Los Angeles . Janowitz 's " Slaves of New York " was last year 's sensation , a campy keyhole peek into the lofts and galleries of downtown Manhattan . Do two best sellers make a trend ? Yes , if you link them to " Bright Lights , Big City , " Jay McInerney 's 1984 smash , a clever narrative notable for the quantities of " Bolivian Marching Powder " that go up the characters ' noses . Decadence is in . There 's nothing like a coincidence of publication dates to open an incipient trend to critical scrutiny . September brings us Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Schuster. $17.95 ) , and Janowitz 's latest dispatch from her island paradise , A Cannibal in Manhattan ( Crown . $16.95 ) . The latter comes with photographs of the characters portrayed by such art-world celebrities as the late Andy Warhol . " The Rules of Attraction , " in contrast , is gimmick free , except for its prose , which often resembles a pastiche of Hemingway . Ellis apes Papa 's taciturn accents where we never expected to find them : " I pushed the coffee away and reached for a cigarette . I had switched majors so many times now that I did n't even care . Drama major was simply the last roll of the dice . " Ellis 's book has a plot , but it 's as incidental as in a rock video on MTV . Things happen : a suicide , several failed attempts , an abortion or two , a drug deal gone sour . But nobody at artsy , permissive Camden College seems to notice . Among the oblivious is bisexual Sean , a literature major , " which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sean is conducting concurrent affairs with art major Lauren and drama major Paul . The three of them ? along with other , more peripheral voices ? take turns telling us about themselves , journal fashion . The pendulum of their days swings from hedonism to nihilism , from depression to boredom . As Laura plaintively asks : " What else is one to do at college except drink beer or slash your wrists ? " @# @# Like " Less Than Zero , " " The Rules of Attraction " is more effective as a sociological exhibit than as a work of literary art . The Camden kids are Gucci rich , Russian Tea Room rich , Neiman-Marcus rich , and there 's usually a divorce in the family closet . At Camden , you are what you smoke and how you smoke it ( consider a " bong , " or water pipe , carried " in a tiedyed satchel " as a personal statement ) , what you wear to " The Dress To Get Screwed Party " ( a toga ) , what you say instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A desultory nostalgia for the icons of the ' 60s washes over everything ; the dormitories are alive with the sound of The Grateful Dead . Tama Janowitz is livelier and more fun ? she 's a Catskills tummler with a punk hairdo . But you ca n't credit her with much power of invention . " A Cannibal in Manhattan " begins as a travesty of " Robinson Crusoe , " borrows liberally from Evelyn Waugh 's " Black Mischief , " broadly imitates the satire of " Candide . " Mgungu Yabba Mgungu , the eponymous hero , is a purple-skinned pygmy just waiting to be discovered on his remote South Pacific isle ( " New Burnt Norton " ) . Along comes Peace @# Corps volunteer Maria Fishburn , who lures Mgungu from his three wives and his pleasant , aimless life to a life equally aimless but far less tranquil in New York . He samples such environments as a posh museum , a hot disco , the city dump , the Bowery and jail . Con men and celebrity scoundrels ? including " the dwarf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . The message , if there were one , is that Mgungu as " a noble and Rousseautype of savage " can not be civilized but only corrupted by the big bad city . But of course Janowitz intends nothing as square as a message ? and nothing as substantial . Thumbed nose : For the clean little secret of chic decadence is that it 's only skin deep . In " Cannibal " as in " Rules , " surfaces go explored while depths are ignored ; style substitutes for character , and the style of choice is brand-name hip . Janowitz is not as relentless a name-dropper as Ellis , but she makes up for the lack by having her characters talk the language of commercials . When Mgungu accepts a Marlboro from Maria he says knowingly , " Come to where the flavor is . " Depending on your viewpoint , that 's either the literary equivalent of a Campbell 's soup can or the moral equivalent of a thumbed nose . Neither Ellis nor Janowitz would sell quite so well if their products were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new decadents as belated counterparts to the pop artists of the ' 60s . Opponents will counter that the books offer all the intellectual nourishment of a wellmade beer commercial . Janowitz 's gullible ex-cannibal could be speaking for the consumers of this meretricious stuff when , surveying the mess of his life , he quips : " My adolescence was perhaps , at age fifty-five , over at last . " Fat chance .
