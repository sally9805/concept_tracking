This argument , advanced by Bishop John Shelby Spong , head of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark , is just one recent step that has thrust him into a swirl of controversy both within his northern New Jersey diocese and around the nation. // To the bewilderment of the 56-year-old church leader , he has become known as the bishop who will perform homosexual marriages , something he said was illegal in the eyes of both the state and the church . All he wants , he insists , is to give his blessing to a relationship that he believes will " reduce rather than encourage promiscuity. " // In an interview in his office here before Christmas , Bishop Spong acknowledged that he was a minority voice in the Episcopal Church but said he did not mind the loneliness . " My sense is if the Episco- pal Church can ' t stand challenge within its own ranks , then it is not a church I would want to be a member of anyway , " he explained. // The author of 11 books and 50 articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " scholar bishop who would challenge the narrow-minded orthodoxy of the past in the light of the stunning revolutionary expansion of contemporary knowledge. " // Much as John Cardinal O ' Connor , the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York , has become a national spokesman for religious orthodoxy and a local figure of authoritarian rule , Bishop Spong has become a champion of the Christian left . His detractors also charge that he has an authoritarian streak . <> <> Board Is Investigating Him // They point to his bitter dispute with Ascension Episcopal Church in Jersey City , which was ruined by fire a year and a half ago . The Bishop has refused to sign over a $574 , 000 insurance check to the church until he can approve of its rebuilding plans . The rector of the church has refused to comply. // " Under canon law , that money is ours , " said the rector , the Rev. George Swanson. // Mr. Swanson ' s supporters have filed charges with the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church , the Rev. Edmond Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rector , wardens and vestry " of Ascension in the dispute over the church ' s finances. // In an unusual step last October , the Presiding Bishop convened a board of inquiry - a body akin to a grand jury - to investigate the accusations and determine whether Bishop Spong should be tried . It would be the first church trial of an Episcopal bishop in the United States in more than 60 years. // Bishop Spong says he is not intimidated . He defends his actions with regard to the Jersey City church , arguing that they are within his powers and , in the long run , in the best interests of the local church . <> <> Earlier Charges Dismissed // Ascension Church , he said , is a small , " almost moribund " parish with a pastor who works only part time . " Once it burned down , all of the issues for its future needed to be decided in the present , " Bishop Spong said. // The charges filed against the Bishop were the second set presented against him this year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prayer Book Society , a small group that wants Episcopalians to return to the 1928 Book of Common Prayer instead of a modern version , said Bishop Spong had violated church law by expressing doubts about the divinity of Jesus and the inerrancy of the Bible . The society also is not happy with his views on sex. // The Prayer Book Society ' s charges , which the Bishop himself compares to heresy accusations , were dismissed by the hierarchy because , the Bishop points out with some satisfaction , not one of the more than 200 Episcopal bishops in the United States would support the petition . <> <> Bishop for 12 Years // Bishop Spong , a 6-foot-2-inch native of North Carolina who retains his Southern drawl , has been the Episcopal Bishop of Newark for 12 years . He and his wife , Joan , live in Morristown and are the parents of three grown daughters. // His advocacy for homosexuals , he said , stems in part from his work on behalf of civil rights for blacks , a cornerstone of his ministry while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he argued , is a genetic factor . To his thinking , it is no different from race or left-handedness. // " We ' ve got to deal with the fact that the church has been violently prejudiced against gay people , " he said . " We ' ve murdered them ; we ' ve burned them at the stake ; we ' ve run them out of town for something over which they have no control . And that ' s immoral . " <> <> New Thinking Urged // Homosexuality , he said , is only one area where the church must begin to reshape its thinking . Traditionally the church has argued that there are only two types of morally acceptable sexual behavior for Christians : abstinence outside of heterosexual marriage and monogamous fidelity within it. // Yet " every priest knows , " Bishop Spong said , that " people getting married today are not inaugurating their sexual activity after marriage. " // " What we ' ve done , " he continued , " is to separate puberty from marriage in our society by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that you don ' t have sex before marriage is not holding any more . It is not because we are immoral ; it is because we ' ve got a different set of circumstances to deal with. " // What is more , he added , with the growing number of divorced people , there are many sexually active adults " who are not rushing into marriage to satisfy their sexual needs. " // " We ' ve got to deal with reality , " he said , and acknowledge that the church ' s old standards " are inadequate. " // His views , Bishop Spong insists , are not an assault on the traditional family . " I want the traditional family upheld , " he said , " but I don ' t want it upheld to the detriment of other people. " //
