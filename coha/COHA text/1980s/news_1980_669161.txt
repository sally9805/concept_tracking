But whether the success is any more than putting enough air in a punctured tire to get the car to a repair station remains to bee seen. // The process has involved a lot of prodding , pushing and pulling , calculated tactical moves , and  --  off in the wings  --  destructive violence and constructive encouragement. // The latest bit of constructive encouragement comes from Algiers , where Saudi Arabia  --  with its eye on President Carter ' s economic difficulties  --  again has dug its heels in against the proposed maximum oil price increase at the meeting of ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. // A digging in of heels less welcome to Washington is that of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin . Speaking to ABC televistion news June 10 , he rejected US Secretary of State Edmund Muskie ' s diplomatically worded censure of Israel ' s settlement policy on the West Bank of the Jordan ( voiced 24 hours earlier ) and announced that Israel plans to establish 10 more settlements. // Israel ' s policy on the West Bank and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a halt last month  --  on the initiative of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat . What provoked him to withdraw from the talks was a bill introduced in the Israeli Knesset ( parliament ) by a private member that would further legalize Israel ' s annexation of east Jerusalem , seized during the " six-day war " of 1967. // Mr. Sadat ' s move probably was a tactical one intended to produce an initiative from the Carter administration , making the point to Mr. Begin that Israel could not ( as most Arabs see it ) use the immobility of an incumbent US President facing re-election to proceed unchecked with the creeping annexation of the West Bank of the Jordan River. // The Egyptian President has secured that initiative . The Carter administration publicly has deplored " unilateral actions that prejudice the final status of the occupied territories " and has persuaded Israeli and Egyptian negotiators to come to Washington to discuss resumption of the autonomy talks . As a sop to the Israelies , the Carter administration said the negotiations could not succeed " if one side is insensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crux of the crisis remain the Palestinians  --  central to the overall Arab-Israel dispute from the outset , but not always recognized as such . If there was a flaw in the Camp David accords , It was that the agreements centered on Israeli withdrawal from Sinai and brought the question of the Palestinians in only by the back door . That method presumably was needed to win Prime Minister Begin ' s signature on the final documents : He always has been a hard-liner on the question of the Palestinians and of the West Bank ( which he studiedly calls " Judea and Samaria " ) . // There are those who suspect that Mr. Begin was forthcoming on withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula only to buttress his ultimate bargaining position on Judea and Samaria . This position is seen as an ideological commitment to permanent control of the West Bank as an integral part of the biblical " land of Israel , " which Jews believe belongs to them by right . To him , the West Bank was " liberated , " not " occupied , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s approach to authonomy in negotiations over the past year . For him and his team , " autonomy " means only limited self-government for West Bank Palestinians but firm Israeli control over the West Bank ' s land and water . Alongside this have gone the continued expansion of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and , most recently , the implantation of Israelis in the Arab city of Hebron. // The result has been an escalation of violence on the West Bank  --  Israelis killed in Hebron and West Bank Arab mayors gravely hurt by booby-trap bombs in their cars. // This upsurge of violence , together with the stalling of the autonomy talks , sharpened the division within the Palestinian political resistance movement . It gave the edge to the Palestinian hard-liners  --  mirror image of the Israeli hard-line zealots  --  at the recent gathering of Palestinians in Syria. // As spring moved toward summer , members of the European Community have been weighing publicly and privately whether to take an initiative of their own toward getting the Palestinians international recognition as a full negotiating party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anathema to Mr. Begin . Partly to assuage him and partly because it wanted to revive and keep going undisturbed the Camp David process , the Carter administration reacted bluntly against any such European move. // Mr. Sadat demurred more discreetly . But there may be grounds for wondering whether both the US State Department ( as indicated by more mellow words last week from Secretary of State Muskie ) and Mr. Sadat might not have seen in the European maneuvering a not entirely unwelcome adding to the pressures on Mr. Begin. // The Saudi role on the sidelines continues , too , to play a part . It goes beyond Saudi efforts in the direction of minimal oil price increases  --  intended as a signal of at least qualified support for the US . Best information is that Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia  --  chief executive of Saudi government policy  --  wants to keep embarrassment to President Carter to a minimum. // The Bottom line in any Saudi government decision is whether it contributes to the durability of the Saudi royal family . This results sometimes in outward paradoxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , while the Saudis are publicly critical of the Camp David process , they may well rejoice if it succeeds. // President Sadat in the past has excoriated them for being critical of him . But , perhaps with US private encouragement , public attacks on the Saudis have been halted in Egypt , and the Saudis have taken note. // It nevertheless would be premature to expect any dramatic move from the Saudis toward Camp David or Mr. Sadat until the Camp David process produces more positively dramatic developments than a mere resumption of the talks and Senator Muskie ' s wagging of his finger at Mr. Begin. // At the same time , Saudi Arabia needs to keep its line out to the US because of the perceived threat to Saudi interests from renewed activism by Iraq as a potential Gulf power and from revolutionary Shia Islam across the Gulf in Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ' s Iran. // There is a parallel move toward lessening the alienation of King Hussein of Jordan , who has resented being snubbed or taken for granted by the US ( as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He compensated for this by cautious rapprochement with the Palestine Liberation Organization , with which he was daggers drawn a decade ago. // Now King Hussein is making plans to come to Washington in response to an official invitation from the Carter administration. // //
