By Leo Rosten . Harper &; Row . 372 pp. $11.95 . So we don ' t have enough with the Mike Hammersteins already , but Leo Rosten has to come schlepping out this shamus named Pinkus , a tough-as-nails private eye who never hits below the Borscht Belt ? You betcha , bubeleh . Add to this a cockamamy plot involving a billionaire named Howard Hughes Smith yet , a mafia don , a trio of gorgeous shiksas and a host of bit-part schlmiels . ( Pinkus ' doorman , in the latter category , is summed up as the kind of guy who would describe an elephant to you " without mentioning the nose . " ) HHS is making a movie ( just like you know who ) featuring the woman he is infatuated with , Valeria Venice . Valeria turns up missing as they say in the private eye biz , and of course Seymour " Silky " Pinkus and his partner are hired to find her . Pinkus ' partner , by the way , is a more traditional shamus - he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he uses more Yiddish expressions than Silky does . This has all got to be strictly for laughs , right ? Well , yes , and it is hilarious , but halfway through the book you realize you ' re reading it to find out what ' s going to happen next , too , because Rosten has somehow managed to suspend your disbelief in this hilarious whodunit . Along the way Pinkus dispenses both physical and verbal punishment to all sorts of low-life , telling one punk : " Let me know when you want to kill me ; I ' ll get converted : I hate for a Jew to die . " And to the reader he dispenses pearls of wisdom from collected aunts and uncles : " The truth can go all the way around the world starch naked , but a lie won ' t make it to the corner unless it wears pants and an overcoat . " The narrative is in the first person , and Rosten allows Pinkus , who ' s aware he ' s in a book , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one chapter Rosten sets us up for something that ' s going to happen in the next , then makes us think it ' s happened , then makes us realize ithasn ' t ( we ' ve been had ) , then shows us that indeed it has . ( Sorry to be so vague about this , but why spoil the suspense ? ) Rosten seems to have had a lot of fun writing this book - he loves one particular pun and plays a theme and variations on it ; he has Pinkus quote " a guy named Rosten ; " and he gives his PI a dog named Mr. Goldberg , who was raised by a rabbi and therefore will eat only kosher food . Rosten also provides a glossary of Yiddish words , athough many have found their way into the vernacular , and he explains that those funny spellings - like " realy " and " thru " - are not the publisher ' s fault but his preference . ( Rosten is as insistent about his own brand of English usage as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , " King Silky " ( he ' s the King of Queens and the Queen of Kings , as he informs an overbearing telephone receptionist ) marks the second appearance of Seymour Pinkus , who made his debut in a book simply called " Silky .
