Last fall it was hard not to notice Delaware 's Senator Joseph Biden . The garrulous Democrat was in the spotlight as a candidate for President , and after a plagiarism scandal forced his withdrawal , he remained at center stage as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Bork hearings . But since February Joe Biden has been seen neither on TV nor in the Senate . Much of the time he has spent in Washington 's Walter Reed Army Medical Center . He checked in on Feb. 12 so doctors could correct an aneurysm near his brain . He returned a month later with a blood clot . Last week Biden was back , again because of an aneurysm . In intensive care after surgery , he was said to be doing well . He is expected to return to duty in the near future .
