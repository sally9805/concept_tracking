The perfume was $28 for three ounces and smelled great , but not that great . " Have you got a small size back there ? " I asked the clerk behind the department store counter . She brought up a " splash on " bottle for $25 . Rock-bottom , final offer . " You better buy now , " she said . " Next week it ' s going up to $33 . " She was one of those assertiveness training graduates who is usually hired to pitch cosmetics . Kindly grandmotherly types with stubby fingernails simply do not go into this trade . They work upstairs in " foundations . " " It ' s one of the top five scents in the country , " she continued , with a look that said , and you ' re not . ' These people are almost always convinced that they could be bottled for $11 an ounce , too . " Maybe I ' ll wait till the interest rates drop , " I said , and her eyes narrowed . It was time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chilly smile , beginning to put the valuables away and look around for a serious client , " if you don ' t think you ' re worth it . " She had just delivered what must be known in the biz as " the ego zap . " Developed at places like Gucci ' s , it has spread throughout the world of commerce and comes in various forms : " Because you ' re worth it " ; " Aren ' t you worth it ? " ; " Too bad you ' re not worth it and your life is a K Mart bag . " Discreet is dead , folks , in case you hadn ' t noticed . Gone are the delicate days when price was never mentioned and the customer was always right . No more the deferential nod from the other side of the cash register and the soft , " Perhaps madame would like something in a moderately priced toilet water . " Now it ' s " cough up , sucker , or we ' ll put you down - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I first got zapped in New York . ( Where else ? ) A figure salon honcho pushing $1500 worth of body work in the late ' 60s ended her free trial assessment session of me with a curt , " If you don ' t think you ' re worth it , dear , nobody else will . " Over the years the zap has intensified and spread , with words such as " upscale , " " lifestyle , " and " ultra " - challenging us to buy everything from coins to condos . In a full page New York Times ad last month , a Park Avenue liquor boutique tickled egos with a $3750 bottle of cognac . " Perfection , " read the copy . " The ultimate cognac . For the fortunate few . " Right . David Rockefeller and Prince Fahd . Last week the Wall Street Journal brought word of an exclusive " Interesting People Club " with annual dues of $4000 , guaranteeing members the quality social contacts they deserved . Founder Iris Ratcliff said bluntly , " We ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to afford our rates . " And you know better than to ask for the small size . The outrageous price tag has become as important or more so than thepurchase itself , never mind the purchaser . We are the society of the $9500 watch , the $100 pair of shoes and the $50 scarf . Any day now I expect someone to market a watch that comes with two armed guards and an alarm system . And it will probably talk , too . You know the type - they sit smugly on a shelf next to a sign that says " I ' m imported from Scandinavia and loaded with rocks , " or " Don ' t touch me - I break . " In a jewelry store in New Mexico , I read the following message from a silver belt buckle : " I am beautiful . I am old . And I am very , very expensive . " I wanted to rap it in the mouth . Nothing against spending a bundle on vanity once in a while . This is tremendous fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by while hard-earned cash has been put out for nonsense . But it has to be my idea to put out the cash , not theirs , at least not obviously theirs . The notion to spend in excess has to flicker crazily in the brain and whip itself into a flaming fantasy of materialism , seemingly unaided by the other side . And when the people behind the counter say " please " and " thank you , " I enjoy myself even more . Sure I ' m worth it . We ' re all worth it , plus tax . This is a given that smart marketers would do well to totally ignore . As my kindly grandmother with the stubby fingernails used to say , " You catch more flies with honey . " In other words , don ' t rub our noses in the product . Especially not perfume - it makes people sneeze .
