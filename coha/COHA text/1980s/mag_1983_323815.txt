The party agrees on a new leader but , as usual , not on defense <P> Just after he was elected to lead Britain 's limping and divided Labor Party last week , Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys took a stroll along Brighton beach for the benefit of photographers . As the cameras clicked , Labor 's new standard-bearer tripped and fell into the chilly surf . Picking himself up , with a grin on his freckled face , Kinnock shook the water off his second-best suit and observed that " the damn tide came in . " <P> The tide indeed had come in-and with unexpected swiftness-for the copper-haired Welshman , who became the youngest leader in the Labor Party 's history . In his 13 years as a Member of Parliament , Kinnock , 41 , a leftist with a pragmatic streak , has never served in a government post . Thus it was a measure of the demoralized Labor Party 's desperate need for a new image , energy and , above all , unity that led it to choose overwhelmingly on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinnock replaced Michael Foot , 70 , who had tendered his resignation after presiding over Labor 's worst defeat in 65 years , when Britons in June re-elected the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Kinnock 's bandwagon rolled over three party heavyweights : the center-right 's Roy Hattersley , 50 , Leftist Veteran Eric Heffer , 61 , and Peter Shore , 59 , a moderate spokesman on economic affairs . The battle for the deputy leader 's post proved much sharper . With Kinnock 's tacit support , Hattersley defeated Leftist Michael Meacher , 43 , thereby establishing what party faithful called " the dream ticket , " a combination that seemed to bridge the deep left-right fissures that have plagued Labor . <P> For this difficult moment in the party 's history , Kinnock was an ideal solution . With working-class roots deep in the black valleys of South Wales-his father was a coal miner , his mother a district nurse-he virtually grew up in the Labor Party . Though he was an indifferent student who eked out a degree from University College , Cardiff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife , whom he met at the university , was so politically oriented that she refused a wedding band made of South African gold . Working together , the Kinnocks won Neil a safe parliamentary seat . <P> For three days , the Brighton conference bathed in an unaccustomed atmosphere of harmony under the dream team . But when the time came to consider the thorny issue of defense policy , unity quickly yielded to familiar acrimony . Backed by Kinnock , the party 's National Executive Committee had crafted a compromise proposal designed to be acceptable to both left and right . Instead , in a wave of emotion , the cheering delegates reaffirmed Labor 's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament . <P> That was just the beginning . Another resolution aimed at NATO rejected " Britain 's membership in any Pentagon-dominated military pact based on the first use of nuclear weapons . " It called for the " elimination " of all foreign bases on British soil ( only the U.S. has such bases ) and declared that Labor 's defense policy must be " solely concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The resolutions passed by overwhelming acclamation.
