In a real-life undercover drama not so long ago , the legendary F.B.I. mole Joseph D. Pistone , alias Donnie Brasco , periodically wore a wire as he burrowed his way into the Bonanno family for what became the Government ' s most successful spy operation ever against the Mafia. // Like the celluloid Downey , Agent Pistone risked being unmasked at any moment . But unlike Downey , he recognized the perils of going around wired and used electronics only sparingly . And unlike Downey , Mr. Pistone , when he was wired , was prepared with a code word . All he had to do was drop the word " purple " into a conversation and his fellow agents eavesdropping nearby would burst forth to rescue him . Luckily , he never had to. // " Married to the Mob , " of course , is not offered as a documentary on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and its methods . It ' s a confection in which even the rub-outs are more comic than ghastly . Yet with all the recent news about grimly real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flag some possible misconceptions , as well as note some accurate depictions , without taking anything away from the zest of the film. // Early on , agent Downey ( Matthew Modine ) zeroes in on the widow of the slain mobster Frank the Cucumber De Marco , a philandering hitman who had the misfortune to be caught getting into a hot-tub with Tony the Tiger ' s favorite waitress . When Tony ( Dean Stockwell ) starts to shower Frank ' s beautiful widow Angela ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) with unwanted attention , Downey figures Angela can help the F.B.I. nail Tony. // " Put me back on 24-hour surveillance , " Downey begs his chief , who complies . Downey and his partner are soon snooping on the innocent Angela. // In reality , surveillance has become a highly specialized F.B.I. art and science . Case agents like Downey , who years ago would have done their own tailing of suspects , now draw on the services of surveillance experts employing an arsenal of " widgets " from high-flying aircraft to beacon transmitters that beam signals from suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the F.B.I. ' s notably successful assault on the Sicilian Mafia ' s drug operations , utilized scores of agents , in fleets of vehicles and planes , whose only job it was to follow suspected heroin dealers and money launderers and shoot pictures and videos from inside darkened vans and hidden lookouts. // Thus , it would hardly have been necessary for a real-life agent Downey to leap out of the roof window of a crowded city bus ( with all the attention that would bring ) to keep up with the exiting Angela : he would have merely radioed fellow agents. // When Downey decides that Angela warrants closer observation , he suggests : " What do you say we tap her ? " In no time , Downey , disguised as a plumber , is breaking into Angela ' s slum apartment to plant hidden microphones to transmit conversations to an F.B.I. " plant " or listening post one floor up . He ' s even up on the roof tuning in on her private conversations with a parabolic microphone that sucks up her words from vibrations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged as the script suggests . Since exposure of notorious abuses largely during the J. Edgar Hoover era , the F.B.I. director or his designated deputy now must personally approve all proposed wiretaps and bugs , based on convincing " probable cause " to believe serious crimes are at issue . It ' s doubtful that Angela ' s efforts to escape the amorous Tony would meet this standard . And only then would the application be forwarded to a Federal judge for a ruling on a warrant. // In the pizza case investigation that eventually produced 100 , 000 wiretapped conversations , agents and prosecutors had to submit hundreds of pages of sworn testimony about what they had learned of the conspiracy before a judge agreed to permit even one phone to be tapped . Moreover , the authorization had to be constantly reviewed and renewed monthly , depending on what was being turned up . ( The longer-running comedy " Midnight Run , " on the other hand , gets it right when the F.B.I. fits Robert De Niro with a body-recorder for a crucial confrontation with the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the supervisor ( Yaphet Kotto ) , who looks remarkably like a tall , black Hoover . And it ' s perfectly permissible . Such consensual recordings , with one party to the conversation agreeing to the taping , have been found not to violate Constitutional rights to privacy . ) Furthermore , electronically overheard conversations have to be " minimized " - tuned out whenever they veer into non-germane , personal areas . Thus , in real life , Downey ' s F.B.I. partner in the upstairs listening post could hardly have been legally listening to Angela purring with delight as a date massaged her feet after a night of dancing. // The fact that the date massaging her feet is agent Downey raises another question . Even in today ' s " new " F.B.I. , such intimacy between an agent and his quarry would tend to incur more than the nasty glare Downey ' s supervisor gives him in the film . Not too long ago , a bachelor agent who spent the night with his girlfriend was called on the carpet to explain his conduct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves in ticklish situations after dark . Once , after a long day of investigation , a bunch of New York agents stopped in a Queens bar for beers . Suddenly in walked one of their targets , Cesare Bonventre , a fast-rising captain in the Bonanno family . A film director could see the possibilities here . But as one of the agents , Charles Rooney , later said , " We just beat feet " and scrammed. // Still , " Married to the Mob " is often wickedly on target . When the bureau springs its trap and confronts Angela with the choice of becoming an informant or facing criminal charges from her complicity with Frank in a household where , she once complained , " Everything we wear , eat or own fell off a truck , " Angela sees how ruthless the Government , too , can be. // " My God , " she cries , " you people work just like the mob . There ' s no difference . " " There ' s one big difference , " the F.B.I. supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " The audience howls. // The film accurately evokes the antic resourcefulness of the bureau . The agents who converge on Miami Beach to trap Tony are riotously garbed in every conceivable disguise aimed at blending into the gaudy hotel environment. // Similarly , when the F.B.I. sought a few years ago to expose a Chinese heroin ring , agents contrived to be ready when the drug kingpin arrived in Houston for a deep-sea fishing expeditiion . The boat he hired was an F.B.I. craft , suitably sown with eavesdropping devices , and the crew was composed entirely of agents. // Yet when Tony the Tiger is finally apprehended and led away by an army of agents , the film would have us believe that Tony would be allowed an unaccompanied visit to the men ' s room , an unaccountable lapse even for bumbling Inspector Clouseau. // In the end , Tony is brought down by a force even more implacable than the Feds - his jealous wife , Connie ( Mercedes Ruehl ) . While few betrayed Mafia wives go as far as Connie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent sufferers of legend . Nor are they as ignorant of their husbands ' activities as often portrayed. // In the pizza connection , wives passed on the cryptic , Sicilian-coded telephone messages between the drug conspirators . One complained bitterly of the bold infidelities of her husband . Few , however , have ever gone so far as the wife of the fearsome Vito Genovese . Amid a bitter divorce action , Anna Genovese once had the temerity to take the witness stand in a court of law and to spill the story of her husband ' s crooked dealings . Unlike Connie Russo , however , she soon saw the error of her ways and re-lapsed into silence. //
