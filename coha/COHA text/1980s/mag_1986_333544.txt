Just a few more days now . At Tower Records in New York City , Manager Kenny Altman , who has already put in " our biggest initial order for as far back as I can remember , " says flat out that " it 's going to be the biggest record of the year , maybe for the next five years . I want a big truck to pull up in front of the store at 9 a.m. on Nov. 10 , with a cash register in the back . For the first few hours we 'll just sell them right off the truck . " Lory Shaw , a buyer for California 's 41-store Music Plus chain , enthuses , " It 's the biggest advance buy we 've ever made . And it 's the first time we 've taken advance orders from customers for any audio product . " <P> Before you wait on the corner for Kenny 's truck or call Lory to place a phone order , there are a few things to keep in mind . The record company , busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid on tight , so very little has been known about Bruce Springsteen &; the E Street Band Live/1975-85 until now . It is a 40-song live set , spanning the past decade in the performing life of America 's greatest rocker and the country 's hottest band : that rumor is right . It wholesales for about $19 : right again . <P> There has also been more argument and speculation about the contents of the album than about what happened at the Reykjavik summit . Yes , classics like Born to Run are there , jumping out of a superb audio mix like a Maserati off the mark . But so are Springsteen standards like Thunder Road and No Surrender , performed with newly spare instrumentation , sounding entirely different and stronger than ever . There are tunes Springsteen wrote for other performers that he has never recorded ( Fire , Because the Night ) , as well as songs that he has borrowed from others ( This Land Is Your Land , War , Raise Your Hand , Jersey Girl ) and refashioned for his own . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " C " , a surfside 1978 instrumental titled in tribute to Saxman Clarence Clemons , is get-down beach music in extremis and in excelsis . The breadth of Springsteen 's spirit and the range of his gifts can handily be measured in the distance between Paradise and Seeds , a workingman 's testament of pride , helplessness and hopelessness from the 1985 tour that is one of his best tunes , and certainly one of his angriest . With all this , there is one more thing . Just incidental , of course , considering that Springsteen is now a certifiable sociological phenomenon , a rocker who is written about by political columnists and cultural essayists who live far from the nearest jukebox . But good to know , anyway . <P> Live/1975-85 is a great record . It puts the life back in live albums , , vividly encapsulating a decade of change into three hours and 35 minutes of rock ' n ' roll that gives no quarter but makes demands that few other musicians today will risk . Springsteen wants your heart to hear . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
