In the unfolding Wall Street scandals , outgoing Securities and Exchange Commissioner John S.R. Shad has been dismayed by how many of the indicted traders are graduates of top business schools . Last week , to bolster ethical training at his alma mater , the Harvard Business School , former Investment Banker Shad made a reported $20 million down payment on a gift that other alumni contributions will eventually bring to $30 million , the school 's largest gift ever . The money will endow chairs and underwrite case studies in ethical issues . In the words of Dean John McArthur , it will allow ethics " to be imbedded in the very fabric of what we teach and research . "
