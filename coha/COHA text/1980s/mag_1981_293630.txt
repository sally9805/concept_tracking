He was a fugitive from the North , and his hard , lean looks , the result of a life in prison that consumed nearly 25 of his 37 years , enabled Jack Henry Abbott to mix in easily with the transient roustabouts who work the Louisiana oilfields . It was the sort of life where a man could , if he wanted to , virtually disappear . Earlier this year , Norman Mailer had led a campaign to secure parole for Abbott , largely on the basis of his writing talent . His letters from prison , collected under the title In the Belly of the Beast , were released to fair critical acclaim . But the ex-convict seemed unable to handle his lionization or his freedom . Two months ago , Abbott got into an argument with a waiter in a New York City restaurant . The two men went outside , and moments later the young waiter was lying on the ground , stabbed to death . Abbott was gone . He fled south to New Orleans , then on to the oilfields along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-hour shifts at $4 an hour and spent hot nights on tired , sheetless mattresses in lonely bunkhouses a hundred miles from nowhere . Last week he was finally run to ground outside Morgan City , La . Abbott offered no resistance and said little until told that Belly had become a literary hit . Said Morgan City Detective Bob Bazet : " When he heard that , he really picked up . " " As an entertainer , I 'd like to be known just as Melvin Dum-mar-without Howard Hughes , " says the former gas-station owner from Cedar City , Utah .

" You heard a little laughter in the background when some tried it for the first time , " said Exercise Leader Arnold Schwarzenegger , 34 , who ventured topside to stir up offshore sales of his book , Arnold 's Bodybuilding for Men . His professional appraisal : " I saw a few potential Schwarzeneggers in the crowd . In fact , most of them were shipshape .

The black community raised nearly $1,000 for a simple , 75-lb. bronze plaque that read in part : " Commemorating the arrival in this harbor of Kunta Kinte , immortalized by Alex Haley in Roots , and all others who came to these shores in bondage . " Two mornings after last week 's installation ceremonies ( attended by Haley ) , someone sheared the six bolts anchoring the plaque and made off with it . Left in its place was a small card with the inscription : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P>
