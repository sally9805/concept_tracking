Q. You 've always been a strong critic of the Soviets , yet just in the past month you have been given a standing ovation at the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow , you 've been respectfully interviewed in Pravda and even given prime- time coverage on Soviet television . What has it been like for you personally ? <P> A. Well , I would n't be human if I did n't confess to a certain amount of ego gratification . When I stood in front of the foreign policy establishment in the Soviet Union and was given a generally empathetic reception , I had a sense of , if you will , historical vindication . But I also had a sense of something much more important . There was a breakthrough taking place in the thinking of people who for 70 years were artificially divorced from the intellectual and philosophical currents of the Western world . They are now in the process of restoring some of those connections , of rejoining that process . They are much , more willing to be self-critical and to listen to criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen out of step with global development , and that has driven them in the direction of seeking far-reaching changes . <P> The last two years of this decade could be the Spring of Nations in Central Europe . I am deliberately drawing the analogy to 1848 , which was called the Spring of Nations because Central European nations rose against authoritarianism . <P> Q. Given the violent aftermath of 1848 , that 's not a very happy precedent . <P> A. No , it is n't . But if things in Central Europe or the Soviet Union go wrong , which they could , I do n't think we 'll see a return to an assertive , confident , Stalinist renewal . Instead , we 'll probably see a turn toward some highly nationalistic form of dictatorship , perhaps what I call a " Holy Alliance " between the Soviet Army and the Russian Orthodox Church , galvanized by a sense of desperate Great Russian nationalism . That would then produce even more intense reactions from non-Russians . It could be a very ugly picture . <P> Q. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can imagine a Soviet intervention in East Germany , where the Soviets have a lot of troops on the ground and therefore on the spot . If the East German Communist regime were to collapse through violence and if the Soviets were to remain passive , then the whole thing would collapse , in Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia . The Soviets know that if they let go of East Germany , Poland is lost . <P> That 's why it is so urgent for us , the West , collectively , to give this turbulence a chance to work itself out constructively in the direction of some form of pluralist democracy . So far , we have not responded in a manner that does justice to the magnitude of the opportunity , or , alas , to the magnitude of the threat inherent in these truly earthquake-like political phenomena . <P> Q. What should we be doing ?
