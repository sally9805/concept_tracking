When two U.S. Navy attack planes were downed during last week 's raid on Syrian missile positions , Pentagon officials quickly ran into some heavy flak at home about what had gone wrong . In Washington and elsewhere critics demanded to know why the U.S. had suffered such humiliating losses in a single mission , especially when the Israelis have for years conducted similar sorties in the region virtually unscathed . <P> Navy officials who sought to deflect the criticism had plausible answers to many of the questions . True , the A-6E and A-7E fighter-bombers used in the attack were subsonic planes designed in the late 1950s , giving rise to charges that outdated equipment was at fault . But Navy spokesmen pointed out that even the Navy 's new F/A-18 high-performance fighter-bomber must slow to subsonic speeds to deliver bombs . <P> Officials also dismissed the suggestion that because the planes flew at a relatively high 20,000 feet before diving for the attack , they were easier targets than if they had flown the entire mission at low altitudes , as the Israelis often do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you come in low in daylight , you expose yourself to everyone with a gun . " <P> Other aspects of the raid were harder to explain . The main reason the two planes had been destroyed , said the Navy , was that they encountered unusually intense antiaircraft fire . Yet the strike had been ordered to retaliate for <P> PEMULDER heavy Syrian fire the day before on a U.S. reconnaissance plane . Despite that warning , Navy officials claimed that the intense antiaircraft fire the next day had caught their pilots by surprise . <P> The Navy 's A-6E , which cost $22 million in 1982 ( the A-7E cost $14 million when last procured in 1980 ) , is supposedly equipped with advanced electronics for low-visibility missions . <P> But a nighttime raid was ruled out on grounds that the pilots could pinpoint <P> their targets only in daylight . In spite of that , the attack was launched before an early-morning haze masking the Syrian positions had lifted . <P> Those disadvantages were compounded by a decision to dispatch the 28 planes in a " target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to adjust their weapons . " It 's not so bad if you 're the lead plane , " says a U.S. pilot with experience in the Viet Nam War , " but if you 're number five or eight , or worse , 28 , you 're going to catch hell . " It seems likely that the two downed planes and a third that escaped with minor damage were hit with concentrated bursts of conventional antiaircraft or machine-gun fire , rather than by Soviet-made SA-7 or SA9 heat-seeking missiles , which can easily be deflected by dropping heat balloons . By contrast , Israeli pilots minimize the danger of antiaircraft fire by attacking with smaller strike forces often spread over several hours .
