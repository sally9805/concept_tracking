October is supposed to be the month of reckoning for the Federal Government , as a new fiscal year begins and the budget is hammered out . In the next four weeks , Congress and the Bush Administration must raise the federal debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion , find a way to reduce next year 's deficit  --  on paper at least  --  to $110 billion , and scrounge for funds to finance the drug war , educational reform and cleanups of the HUD mess and even of the storm-ravaged South Carolina coast . <P> Faced with such unpleasant responsibilities , what did Washington do ? Once again , it lost itself in a politically irresistible orgy of tax reduction . By voting to fulfill George Bush 's campaign promise and cut capital-gains taxes , House Republicans and renegade Democrats jumped at a short-term boost in revenues against a long-term loss . The giveaway fractured the foundation of the landmark 1986 tax-reform law . The drain on the Treasury could be compounded when the measure reaches the Senate , where it is expected to pass , and Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed like a classic outbreak of " now-nowism , " as Budget Director Richard Darman , who helped broker the deal , labels the nation 's hunger for immediate gratification . <P> Early this year , the capital-gains cut looked like a pledge that could not be redeemed . It was one of the few campaign issues on which George Bush took a beating from Michael Dukakis ; Bush 's congressional allies introduced legislation , but with no real hope of passage . When the proposal began to gather surprising momentum , Democratic leaders denounced the idea as a giveaway to Bush 's rich friends and thundered about a " defining issue "  --  one on which Democrats should hold fast to demonstrate just what the difference is between their party and the Republicans . For Bush to prevail in the House , even assuming total G.O.P. support , he needed no fewer than 42 Democratic defectors . <P> But the vote last Thursday was not even close . The decision came on a Democratic alternative to the capital-gains cut that would have made tax- deductible IRAs available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest incomes . That proposal lost , 239 to 190 . Bush bagged 64 Democrats , while only one Republican , Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska , voted for the alternative . <P> What happened ? To House Speaker Thomas Foley , the answer was simple : Americans love a tax cut  --  any kind of tax cut  --  and the legislators reflected that feeling . Democrats contended , correctly , that 80% of the benefits from the capital-gains slash would go to people making more than $100,000 a year , 60% to those with incomes over $200,000 . No matter , says Foley . Tell an ordinary taxpayer that he will reap $10 from a measure that will save the likes of Donald Trump an average of $25,000 a year , and the taxpayer will reply , " Fine . Give me my $10 . " <P> There were other reasons too . Bush undoubtedly swung some votes by last- minute lobbying . Many Congressmen bought the Administration argument that a tax cut would spur business investment , creating more jobs and prosperity for everybody . In theory the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up money for risky ventures . Economists have long disputed whether that is true , but it remains an article of faith among conservatives .
