Now , everybody is getting edgy , at least everybody who has a real chance to get elected , and even some who do not . It could hardly be otherwise . Come Wednesday morning , only two or three candidates in each party will remain realistic candidates for their party ' s nomination , and one or two of them will be in trouble . After more than a year of planning , organizing , speechmaking and striving , it all comes down to the next day or two , and to the still uncertain decisions of perhaps 20 , 000 voters in this tiny frozen state . All of which is enough to bring out the hypersensitivity even in a strong-willed , confident man , especially if he thinks his opponents have distorted his record . Every one of the presidential candidates thinks that . They ' re all correct . So it was no surprise that on Saturday night , when most people go out , the presidential candidates went negative . Most contenders who had not already done so began criticizing their opponents via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial calls Sen. Bob Dole a " straddler . " Rep. Richard Gephardt , the target of most of his Democratic competitors , unveiled a new spot calling Gov . Michael Dukakis " one of the biggest tax raisers in Massachusetts history . " Sen. Paul Simon , who spent most of the week leading the gangup on Gephardt , also takes on Dukakis , saying the governor does not have enough " vision and trust and conviction and fire in the heart for working men and women and the less fortunate . " In addition , Gephardt and Simon continued to squabble in person and on paid commercials , a battle that may have damaged both men and helped Dukakis . Dukakis is the top Democratic target because he is the odds-on Democratic favorite , leaving only the question of who will finish second , and how far down . Whoever does not finish second may find himself finished , unable to raise money or to get news coverage . The winner of the Republican race is far less certain , but the attacks on Dole by Bush and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least pulled even with the vice president , and has perhaps pulled a little bit ahead . The situation allows Dole and Dukakis to stay off the attack , appearing statesmanlike rather than combative . Dole has even chosen , so far , not to air a television commercial questioning Bush ' s capacity for leadership . But on the stump Dole has not stopped needling Bush on that subject , and on the vice president ' s privileged upbringing . " The American people are yearning for leadership , someone who has been tested , who ' s made it the hard way , " Dole said over the weekend . And Dole ' s fabled sharp tongue has emerged from time to time . After a newspaper ' s editorial page endorsed Rep. Jack Kemp , Dole refused to answer a question posed by one of the paper ' s reporters . " Go ask Kemp . He ' s your man , " Dole said . Dukakis , too , showed a bit of testiness when he was criticized during Saturday ' s Democratic debate . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Dukakis ' energy policy was , Dukakis shot back , " If you ' d been around in the long hot months of the summer , you ' d know . " It was an obvious reference to Hart ' s temporary , troubled absence from the campaign . If the candidates are on edge , it is because many of the voter decisions seem equally unresolved . The latest tracking survey by the Boston Globe indicated that though only a few voters were undecided , many decisions remained tentative and uncertain . Though Dole narrowly led Bush in the last poll , for instance , more than 40 percent of the Dole supporters said they might change their mind before Tuesday ' s voting , and almost a third of Bush ' s backers said the same . And though Simon has just about tied Gephardt for a distant second place behind Dukakis , 42 percent of the Simon voters and the 36 percent of those who say they are for Gephardt could switch . Both surveys were taken before the Democrats debated Saturday and the Republicans on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portray an uncertain electorate , with many voters seeking alternatives to the early front-runners , Bush and Dukakis , but not certain they have found the right ones in Dole and either Gephardt or Simon . This provides opportunity for the trailing candidates , not to win but to surprise the political world by finishing higher than expected . The Republican fight for third among Kemp , Pat Robertson and Pete du Pont is as tight as the Democratic fight for second , with Kemp and du Pont facing likely elimination after Tuesday ' s vote . Robertson will go on no matter what , to the joy of some Republicans and the dismay of others . Robertson ' s opponents have been reluctant to criticize him , perhaps wary of angering his loyal supporters . But Kemp did say on NBC-TV ' s " Meet the Press " that Robertson " doesn ' t know what he ' s talking about " on monetary policy . The Democrats hoping to score that last-minute surprise are Bruce Babbitt , who acknowledges he will be finished without success here , and Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this primary .
