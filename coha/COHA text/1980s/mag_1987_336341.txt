He and his wife and two young daughters moved into their new home in McLean , Va. , last month , just as the first grass began to peep through on their newly seeded front lawn . Their dwelling , though , is more than just a cozy little nest in the suburbs . The Reids ' Colonial-style house has 15 rooms , including four bedrooms , a library and an exercise center . Stereo music can be piped into each room , and , using infrared remote-control devices , the family can operate the sound system and even select a track on a compact disc from any part of the house . The home also has 4 1/2 baths , six fireplaces and a high-tech exterior lighting system .

" One might look like Mount Vernon , one like the White House and one like Monticello , " says Randolph Williams , developer of more than 20 luxury-home communities in the Washington suburbs . Inside , the new mansions often combine traditional elegance and modern glitz . Among the common features are mahogany trim , granite counter tops , marble floors , custom-made Palladian windows and spectacularly high ceilings .
