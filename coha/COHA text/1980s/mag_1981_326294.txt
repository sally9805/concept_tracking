FORT APACHE , THE BRONX Directed by Daniel Petrie Screenplay by Heywood Gould <P> It is time-past time-to say something nice about Paul Newman . Of course , he has been well loved for his blue eyes and his cheeky style by a couple of generations of women . But aside from his roles in The Hustler , various pairings with Robert Redford and one or two other films , he has not been taken seriously by critics and other sobersides . That is understandable , since it is possible that no major U.S. star has endured more indifferent movies ( beginning with his 1954 debut in The Silver Chalice ) than he has . <P> So Fort Apache , The Bronx must be gratefully received , because it provides Newman with his first opportunity in years for a full-scale star turn . " Fort Apache " is the headquarters of New York City 's 41st precinct , which encompasses the toughest black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods of the South Bronx . Newman plays a patrolman who is stuck in grade largely because of an excess of street-bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asner , decides to shape up the 41st by launching wholesale arrests to nab suspects in the murder of two policemen , the residents run riot . During one fracas , Newman sees a colleague hurl an innocent youth to his death . The rest of the film deals with Newman 's agonizing over whether to report this police crime . <P> While wrestling with his moral crisis , Newman gets to act all kinds of things : tough , rebellious , weary , angry , loving , even , for a couple of fine moments , absolutely crazy . That is when he has to disarm a psycho who is threatening a crowd with a knife . Newman turns his hat around , pulls faces and starts mumbling wildly to himself , so startling the lunatic that he docilely hands over his weapon . <P> The film is not quite up to its star . It occupies a country somewhere between Barney Miller and the works of Joseph Wambaugh : a land of masculine camaraderie in which the bureaucrats do n't understand how things are in the real world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they both inhabit the same mean streets . But the cut of life examined in the film and its attitudes are not highly original , and are too close for comfort to the manner of made-for-TV movies . <P> Yet there are some good , quick comic bits among the gang in the station house , an interesting doomed romance between Newman and a Puerto Rican nurse ( Rachel Ticotin ) , and some all right , brutal but brief action . Beyond that , the movie takes a liberal attitude toward its milieu , falling neither into despair nor into the tough-minded rightist posturing that marks most police epics , which tend to be cut along the Dirty Harry bias . <P> But mainly it is Newman , now 56 , who gives Fort Apache its modest distinction . From Somebody Up There Likes Me onward , there has been a main line to his best performances , a certain inarticulate striving toward decency on the part of men who may not be the smartest guys in the world , but who have discovered their better natures through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line . <P> - By Richard Schickel
