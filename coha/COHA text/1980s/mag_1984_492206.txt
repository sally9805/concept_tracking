If you have already discovered the truth in the adage " it 's more blessed to give than to receive , " just wait until you give something made by your own two chisel-scarred , varnish-stained hands . You 'll find even more satisfaction when , instead of the usual polite " That 's nice " ( only to have the store-bought thing shelved after a cursory examination ) , your child or grandchild joyously puts your handmade gift to use  --  and over the years lovingly wears it out and as lovingly puts his hand to rebuilding it . You say the only thing you ever tried to make was a doghouse ? And the dog left home the next day ? Not to worry . Thanks to Peter Steven-son 's Wood Toys and Dollhouses ( Chilton Book Co. , Radnor , PA 19087 205 pp. , $15.95 ) , you have the plans for constructing long-lasting toys from rough-and-ready materials that gain appeal with time . All you need for this labor of love is a one-quarter-inch electric drill , a hand-held circular saw and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools already in your kitchen drawer : hammer , pliers , screwdriver , chisel and wrench . You 'll need the wood , of course , to begin with , and the varnish or paints to add the final touch . But Stevenson generously supplies the accurate tine work , a materials list and cutting and finishing techniques for all the 15 " old faithful " toys in his carefully illustrated book . Although we lingered longest over the Dump Truck , the Steam Shovel , the Dollhouse and the Log Cabin , nostalgia finally led us to decide on the Jumping Horse . Mr. Stevenson warns that because the jumping horse , suspended on tension springs , is high-spirited , it should be used with adult supervision . But do n't overdo it . Once you have proudly presented your handsome handmade gift to the lucky rider-to-be on Christmas morning , do get off and give the kid a chance . Kids catch on pretty quick nowadays .

Figure - V The jumping horse is suspended on tension springs attached to the surrounding corral fence and provides lively jumping action for young children in a wide range of ages . However , because it is high-spirited , it should be used with adult supervision . The body of the horse is made of three layers of 2 " x6 " redwood , cedar or pine ( or any other medium soft-wood stock ) , with 3/4 plywood legs . The head is cut from a redwood 4x4 . Cutting and drilling The corral : The first step in building the jumping horse is to cut the corral posts from rough redwood or cedar 2x2s . These can be sanded to prevent splintering , but use rough-cut stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2x2s will measure 1 1/2 " xl 1/2 " and are too small . ) The rails and crosspieces can be cut from finished or rough 1 " x3 " stock ( or split grape stakes with a crosssection size close to this size ) . Cut the 30 " x23 " plywood base . ( We used ACX for better weather protection . ) Then cut three 201/2 " posts and one 28 " post from the 2x2 and trim the top ends to a blunt bevel with a crosscut saw . Drill 14 " pilot holes through the base at the corners so that the bottoms of all four posts can be attached to the base 3/4 " in from the long-side edges and flush with the end edges . Drive 31/2 " nailsup through the bottom of the base and into the end grain of the posts . Drill pilot holes for the wood screws through the rails and crosspieces and screw them to the posts ( fig. 1 ) . Notch the crosspieces at the midpoint and bend them slightly so they can cross without being notched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add stability to the corral frame . Next , drill with a Y6 " bit through the four posts in the positions shown , then insert a ' A , " eyebolt in each hole from the inside of the corral . Bolt them tight with a washer and lock nut and trim the bolt flush with the nut ( filing the ends to round off ) . Drill a Vi " hole through the " hitching post " as shown ; then cut and insert a 6 " length of 1/2 " dowel . Sand all sharp corners and potential splinters at the edges with 80-grit , then 150-grit sandpaper . Apply two coats of satin-finish , exterior-grade varnish . After varnishing , cut a 30 " x36 " rectangle of plastic grass carpet and notch to clear the posts ( fig. 2 ) . Wrap the edges of the grass carpet under the base and staple it in place with % " staples . The top rail at the front of the corral ( the hitching-post end ) can be wrapped with alternating spirals of red and white plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hook the heavy-duty tension springs on to the eyebolts at the corner postsand use a pair of pliers to open the spring eyes . Use the pliers to crimp the spring and eyes after mounting to prevent the springs from becoming detached during a ride . The horse : To build the horse , start by making the patterns for the front and hind legs and transfer them to the N " plywood . Drill holes for the I " pipe-hanger poles as shown in figures 3 and 4 . Make the pattern for the body and follow the dimensions in figures 5A and B. Transfer the pattern to the 2x6 and cut three of these pieces for the body . Select one piece to form the center layer , then mark the dotted lines showing the position of the neck at the center layer ( 5A ) . Mark the positions of the 1 " holes for the pipe hangers and drill through all three layers with a 1 " - diameter spade bit for the power drill . Next , mark the dotted cutoff lines on the center layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mounting slot for the next piece of 2x6 . Make the pattern for the neck piece and transfer it onto the remaining 2x6 stock ( 6 ) . Then place the legs in position on the two outside body layers and mark the outlines onto the body parts . Nail and glue ( driving pilot holes through the other layers , if needed , to prevent splitting ) each side layer to the center body layer and to the neck piece . Align all parts flush at the top surface of the body ( the jumper 's back ) and position the. nails within the outlines of the legs so that the heads will be hidden when the legs are attached . The next step is to cut the 18 " x3/4 " inside-diameter pipe hangers . Then drill Y , 6 " - diameter holes through one side of the pipe , the center of the holes spaced 1/2 " in from each end of each pipe . Insert the pipes through the holes in the body , then slip the legs over the ends of the pipe and slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nail them in place with glue . Wrap the hanger pipes with 3/4 " black plastic tape next to the sides of the jumper to a thickness of about % " to prevent side slip . continued on page 81 Horse continued from page 63 Cut the head from a short length of rough redwood 4 " x4 " ( Fig. 7 ) . ( Cedar or pine can be substituted and the head laminated from six layers of I " x6 " stock cut in profile , glued together , then trimmed to size from the top view . ) The profile and top views can be cut with a handsaw and rounded with a Surform wood shaper or cut with a band saw . Cut the profile first , then the top outline . Finally , drill the ear , eye and nostril holes with wood spade bits to the diameters shown , about 3/4 " deep . The notch for the neck can be cut out , as shown , with a band saw or a hand saw . Use a chisel to cut down the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V-diameter dowel ears and glue and screw them to the ear holes . Glue and slip down the slot at the back of the head onto the neck and drive screws in through pilot holes , as shown in Figure 7 , to mount the head solidly on the neck . With the jumper body complete , use a Surform wood shaper to round off all sharp edges and remove splinters . Sand the body smooth with #80-grit , then 150-grit sandpaper , and either paint or varnish the horse and frame . Make a bridle and reins from an inexpensive dog leash , as shown in Figure 8 . To make a saddle , cut the shape shown in the grid pattern from Naugahyde ; then cut another layer 1/4 " larger all the way around from the red felt . Glue both layers in place with contact cement . Paint crossbars , hoofs , top of the ears , hanger springs and eyebolts semigloss black . Drill 7/5 " - diameter holes in the neck , rump and top of the head as shown in the patterns to provide anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 " or 10 " length of tail and one end with black plastic tape and insert the ends into the holes . To hold the rope in place , angle and drive small finishing nails through it . After anchoring the rope , unravel and fluff it into a continuous mane ; trim to length with scissors . Wrap the base of the tail with more tape to help it stand , then unravel the end and comb it out . Assembly : To mount the jumper , bend the spring ends open enough to slip into the holes on the top sides of the hanger pipes . Close the eyes . Round all the metal parts with a file and tape the corners .
