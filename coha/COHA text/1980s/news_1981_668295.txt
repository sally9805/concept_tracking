Christian Science Monitor The long-simmering problem of Brazil ' s growing foreign debt , today at nearly $60 billion , has emerged as the most serious aspect of the country ' s economy . The debt , the largest of any developing country , even surpasses in urgency the more than 100 percent inflation rate . Possible renegotiation of Brazil ' s foreign debt has become the subject of prime-time television debates , press coverage , round- table economic conferences , and general widespread discussions . In the words of Mario Henrique Simonsen , former minister of economic planning and now a director of Citicorp in New York , " inflation hurts , but balance-of-payments deficits kill . " For the actual minister of economic planning , Antonio Delfim Netto , and most of his government colleagues , the thought of possible renegotiation is unthinkable . Any such suggestion is " totally irresponsible , " warns the minister , " as it would cut off the flow of new loans the country desperately needs , and then Brazil will be in a real recession , with large-scale unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moura da Silva , adds : " The moment the foreign banks stop loaning , imports will stop , factories will stop , and the whole country will come to a standstill . " The solution , it is pointed out , is to apply stronger brakes on economic expansion , concentrate on exports , and reduce imports to the very minimum . Some even recommend that Brazil swallow its pride and apply to the International Monetary Fund for assistance , which the government has persistently refused to do . Up to now , Brazil has been scrupulously meeting its obligations by new borrowings and the simple expedient of " rolling over " the maturing loans . But it is a question of how long foreign creditors will accede to this , especially since Brazil is already in the midst of one of the worst recessions with no signs of improvement in the balance of payments . According to official figures published by the central bank , the nation ' s foreign debt on March 31 stood at $54.5 billion , broken down in the following broad categories : Billions Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian banks$10.4 Import financing by US and foreign agencies$ 6.6 Private import financing$ 5.4 Other indebtedness$ 3.7 Total$54.5 By midyear , foreign indebtedness rose $1.8 billion more , and the central bank estimates that it will reach at least $60 billion by year-end . On the other hand , the dwindling foreign-exchange reserves were down to $6.2 billion on June 30 , from a peak of over $10 billion in 1979 . The bill to be paid by Brazil this year is $19.5 billion - $7.5 billion in interest rates , $8 billion in maturities , and $4 billion for variousfinancial fees . So far , Brazil can only count on receiving $4 billion in new foreign investments and import credits . That leaves $15 billion , of which $10.3 billion has already been obtained in the first six months . Authorities do not anticipate difficulty in borrowing the remaining $4.7 billion . Critics of Brazil ' s economic policy include not only opposition political leaders but also a large segment of the business community . They claim that a substantial share of foreign loans over the year went down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed , and illicitly enriching numerous contractors and high-up politicians . It is estimated that illegal personal Brazilian holdings abroad may be as high as $40 billion . Critics also feel some economic policies are inconsistent . Recently , the central bank disclosed that Brazil has over $1 million in credits extended to Poland . A leading industrialist , Antonio Ermiro de Moraes , and a well- known professor , Maria da Conceicao Tavares , are advocating renegotiation as " a basic step to free Brazil ' s economy from external turbulences of international recessions and high interest rates . " Celso Furtado , former minister of economy in the early 1960s and a prominent economist who spent years lecturing at the Sorbonne , maintains that each " rolling over " or extension of a loan already constitutes in fact a renegotiation , usually at higher interest . A somewhat different view is taken by Chandra Hardy , chief of the division of financial studies at the World Bank and author of a study of 46 cases of debt renegotiations in the past 35 years . She places Brazil in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt would make foreign bankers hesitant to curtail drastically the flow of new loans . " Irving Freidman , international consultant to the First Boston Corporation and a former vice-president of Citibank , said in the Brazilian magazine Istoe , " The banks would find a way if Brazil would seek renegotiation , probably continuing the refinancing of the existing debt , although this would weaken Brazil ' s credit standing . " He thinks , however , that in view of Brazil ' s strong base with the banks , renegotiation is unnecessary . This opinion appears to be shared by the majority of creditor banks . George Betts , director of the international division of the Bank of London &; South America , says categorically : " There doesn ' t exist a single international creditor today who suffers from insomnia because of Brazil . " But the strongest defense of Brazil ' s foreign debt comes from its biggest creditor . In a recent interview in New York with a Brazilian current-affairs magazine , Veja , Gesualdo A. Costanzo , vice-chairman of Citicorp of New York , expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed the most critical period . " At the end of last year , " he says , " many bankers were pre-occupied with Brazil , but the steps taken to improve the economy have changed the perspective , and the loans are flowing in . " In his estimation , the mere size of the indebtedness means little . It ' s necessary to examine the entire dimension of the economy . As long as the growth of the debt accompanies the growth of the economy , Costanzo sees no reason to interrupt the process . More than $25 billion of Brazil ' s total foreign indebtedness , or 46 percent , falls due between now and the end of 1984 , with $7.1 billion due next year . There will be no substantial reductions in maturities until 1989 , when they will fall to $2.8 billion . These figures do not account for interest rates and frequent devaluations of the cruzeiro against the dollar . One area relatively free of financial worry is Brazil ' s trade balance . Exports this year are expected to increase 15 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first seven months of the year , the trade deficit amounted to the relatively small sum of $182 million , and it is generally conceded that Brazil may break even in its trading account .
