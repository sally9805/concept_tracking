 | Imagine a musical genius , and you imagine a quirky misfit toiling away in isolation . But the enduring masterpieces in the world of dance have been works born of collaboration ? from Tchaikovsky 's " Nutcracker , " written with the director of the Russian Imperial Ballet , Marius Petipa , standing over the composer 's shoulder , to Aaron Copland 's lyrical " Appalachian Spring , " composed for Martha Graham 's dance company in 1944 . This week , the results of a bold experiment to rekindle the collaborative fires will be unveiled at the American Music Festival at New York 's Lincoln Center . Frustrated by the wall that has grown ever higher between composers and choreographers in recent decades ? and by criticism that his own New York City Ballet is drifting aimlessly ? Artistic Director Peter Martins has thrown open the doors of his company to see what drifts in . Over the next three weeks , 21 new ballets by 14 of the world 's leading choreographers will make their international debut . All are set to American music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned just for the occasion . City Ballet is an appropriate laboratory for such an experiment . It was home , after all , to the great collaboration of the 20th century ? between composer Igor Stravinsky and the company 's founder and director , the late George Balanchine . Intellectual ? and passionless . The crucial relationship between composers and choreographers began to disintegrate as music became increasingly obscure in midcentury . Composers absorbed by mathematics and musical theory were crafting highly intellectual compositions ? arrhythmic , cool , passionless works that were inaccessible to all but the initiated few . " The music often was n't even listenable , " says choreographer Lar Lubovitch , whose modern-dance company recently celebrated its 20th-anniversary season . " It was all about experimental processes . Pleasing the ear was n't a high priority . " It also did n't exactly make you want to get up and dance . A few choreographers tried applying academic principles to dance , but the result , says Lubovitch , was " wallpaper dance ? all flat and decorative and cold . " Shut out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York-based choreographer Laura Dean composed her own music . Innovators like Trisha Brown and Lucinda Childs experimented with dancing on a silent stage , and a number of choreographers tried making ballets to spoken text . Many turned to the classics ? bringing Mozart , Chopin , 62  | Brahms and Bach onto the ballet stage . Such works had the melodic and rhythmic qualities that made them suitable for dance . And , equally important , they were cheap . Composers were now commanding as much as $25,000 for a newly commissioned work ? a fee that struggling dance companies could ill afford to pay . That problem persists today : The Ford Foundation has recently stepped in with $900,000 for a program of joint commissions in music and dance . The return of rhythm . After several arid decades , the seeds of a new era of collaboration were planted in the 1970s with the emergence of the " minimalist " style ? dubbed " **26;1137;TOOLONG music " because of its repetitive , intensely rhythmic character . Compositions by Philip Glass and Steve Reich were seized upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances were in perfect harmony with the hypnotic quality of minimalism : The newest ReichDean collaboration , " Four Sections , " will debut at next week 's festival . The more recent emergence of the " new romantics " ? composers like John Adams and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich , who write highly melodic , emotional works ? has also been welcomed in the dance world . " Minimalism restored rhythm , " says Lubovitch . " And the neoromantics are now restoring character and narrative . " Or , as Michael Torke , a 26-year-old composer who is collaborating with Martins , puts it : " Music is once again accommodating human joy and pain . I 'm interested in the feeling of blood pounding through the veins . " The personal path that led Torke to dance is emblematic of the more general flight of composers from the arid intellectualism of the recent past . After winning the coveted Rome Prize three years ago ? and finding 12 months of undisturbed creative isolation in an Italian villa more stifling than inspiring ? he was back prowling the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was seeking , he said , " a new Stravinsky . " Their first joint effort was " Ecstatic Orange , " a percussive , jarring composition against which Martins set a languid , tranquil dance . When that ballet brought Martins major critical acclaim , he invited Torke to give it another go . Their new work , " Black and White , " will premiere at the festival next week . The other composers and choreographers contributing to the festival likewise have rebelled against the academic notion that music is for musicians only ? or at any rate for those educated enough to understand obscure musical theory . They have deliberately set out to ensure broad popular appeal . Lubovitch ? who recently did his first stint on Broadway staging Stephen Sondheim 's " Into the Woods " ? set his new ballet to Gershwin 's " Rhapsody in Blue " because , he says , " it 's the quintessential American sound , the first piece of classically proportioned music that incorporated American pop and jazz . " Torke built " Ecstatic Orange " on the bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new-wave rock band , the Talking Heads . He dismisses those who compare him with Stravinsky : " Stravinsky was Russia and France . I 'm New York and rock-and-roll . " Puncturing pretensions . Torke 's irreverence occasionally sets off sparks with Martins , who was schooled in the noble tradition of the Royal Danish Ballet . At one point , the young composer proposed that they base a ballet on the ' 60s party game Twister . He 'd already spoken to artist Keith Haring about painting huge dots in primary colors around which the dancers could contort their bodies . " I think we should be destroying the royal air that surrounds ballet , " said Torke . " We need to shatter expectations , question notions of what constitutes artistic quality . " " Too camp , " replied Martins , and the idea was jettisoned . Frankfurt Ballet director William Forsythe has no such reservations , however . He is forever trespassing across the boundaries between high and low culture . For his contribution to the American Music Festival , the choreographer suggested to composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raspy baritone of Louis Armstrong and an assortment of metallic , industrial sounds . The result is an angular , syncopated , edgy composition , ideally suited to Forsythe 's restless , off-balance style . " I like the idea of a hybrid , " says Forsythe . " Ballet is n't some snooty aristocrat . She 's not going to stand up and say : I am ballet . I do not like rock-and-roll . ' I mean , baby , we 're just dancing to the music . " Rewriting Beethoven ? Little is sacred to Forsythe , a protege of George Balanchine 's . He has set dances to the music of Aretha Franklin and Dionne Warwick . And he frequently meddles with Leslie Stuck 's compositions . " After all , " says the choreographer , " he 's not Leslie van Beethoven . " Though for that matter , Beethoven himself is not immune to Forsythe 's antics . Lying on a beach listening to the classical composer 's late quartets , the choreographer began to fool with tempos and discovered that , at slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worst German oompah band . I wanted to put on my lederhosen and grab a stein of beer . " Living composers may resist such tinkering . But still , such freedom to experiment has been the hallmark of great , truly collaborative efforts between choreographers and composers . Petipa had no hesitations about rewriting Tchaikovsky to accommodate his choreography . In fact , he would hand the composer a precise scenario , specifying tempos and the number of bars for each passage . It 's not only choreographers that reap the benefits of collaboration : The new synergy pays off for composers as well , by bringing their music before audiences who would not otherwise be exposed to it . Dance can also help illuminate elusive music . As Stravinsky once said after watching his Movements for Piano and Orchestra : " To see Balanchine 's choreography is to hear music with one 's eyes . The choreography emphasizes relationships of which I had hardly been aware . " That is especially important for America 's contemporary composers , who must continually struggle to get their works before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Ballet is doing more for new American music than any orchestra in the country .
