" Look at that gang out there , " said Thomas E. Moran , pointing to the Brighton High School football team . " What are you going to do now , throw them out on the streets ? " Moran , senior adviser to physical education and sports in Boston schools , was reacting to acting Boston School Supt. Paul A. Kennedy ' s proposal to cut out all sports programs as part of a $5.5 million to $6 million budget cut . The reactions , from Moran to the cheerleaders , was the same : " You can ' t cut out such an important part of the school system . " Kennedy ' s proposal would affect not only athletes , but also would eliminate the need for cheerleaders , pep squads and bands . Head cheerleaders Diane Petrillo and Carla D ' Annolfo of East Boston , said sports are a way of making friends . " This is how we met . Everybody in school gets involved , whether they play or not . Without that , school would be like a prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , " said Brighton cheerleader Patty Cusack . " This is why a lot of kids stay in school . They get involved in cheering , and they enjoy it . If this is taken away from them , they ' ll say , Why should I bother ? ' " Moran said 6813 students were involved in 16 programs in the senior high schools last year . That does not include an additional 4000 in the middle schools . " There are disciplines and rules and regulations the athletes must obey , " said Moran . " This is what keeps the kids in line . There are practices they must attend , and they have to be in school to play . If there are no sports , what will keep these 10,000 kids in school ? " Sports account for one-half of one percent of a $195 million budget , " Moran continued , " and it could be a real rough thing if it goes through . If it does , it could be devastating . It ' s just a matter of coming up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom Moran calls " the patriarch of the coaches , " has coached football and baseball for 33 years at Boston English . The proposed cut has not pleased him , either . " How can I be happy after being in the business for 33 years ? " he asked . " Sports is a medium of education . We ' ve been on the field since the 25th of August , and we haven ' t been paid . But we ' re not worried about it . We ' re here for the kids . " Brighton football coach Jim Thornton said that when the school committeecut out gymnastics , cross-country , golf and crew this year , it already hurt a lot of students . " There were 150 kids in gymnastics at Madison Park high and 120 in crew at Boston Latin and Boston Tech , " said Thornton . " We know that they have to cut something , and they always start with athletics . For the amount of money they cost the city , I can ' t see why they pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When asked to react , they just shake their heads . " I was upset , " said Brighton tri-captain Marvin Stevenson . " A lot of kids can ' t afford college but have the talent to get a scholarship . How can they be seen out on the field if they cut out sports ? " " It ' s unfair to students and unfair to the city , " said East Boston co- captain Joe DiNicola . " There will be a lot of different attitudes towards school , but it keeps you off the street . " Larry Mancini , also a Brighton captain , said , " This is something that will be taken away from the individuals . A lot of kids will just drop out of school . For some kids , that ' s what keeps them in school . " Dan Foley , 28 , of Brighton , graduated from Boston English high school . He said the school committee could save some money by cutting in different areas . " If they gave the schools back to the neighborhoods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to keep the kids from killing each other , " he said , " there would be plenty of money left over for sports and education .
