 | No , I do n't like this at all , at all , Seamus told himself . Her Ladyship would be profoundly offended at what they 've done with the memories of our liturgy . After each verse they sipped at the little cups of liquid . Seamus managed to spill most of his . In the darkness , no one noticed . The light in the globe changed colors rapidly . The singing , the lights , the swaying motion of priests and crowd were hypnotic . O'Neill struggled to maintain his equilibrium . The strange liquid , even in small amounts seemed to be more of a liquor than a wine  --  sweet and soft . It had a powerful and immediate effect . Ugly images raced across his mind ; he was hard put to control the terror they evoked in him . Images of the Iona blowing up , the Wild Geese being slaughtered , the Captain Abbess being destroyed by a satanic serpent , rape at High Mass in the chapel , inundated him . Then , replacing all the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate moments that seemed like the whole of eternity and more , these terrifying pictures became the only reality in his existence . They were true and nothing else was . He fought to break from them , but they would not let him go . They absorbed his mind , permeated his imagination , filled his soul . It was the end of all he believed in , all he wanted , all he was willing to die for . For several terrible seconds he was captured by a compulsion to dash up on the worship platform and throw himself into the pit of fire , to obliterate himself as all his hopes and loves had been destroyed . Then the full rays of the sun flooded the plaza . It was all over . There was a loud exclamation of joy from the crowd , like the Deo Gratias at the end of Mass . They began to file out of the Worship Plaza , just as calm and normal as when they came in , chatting pleasantly with their companions . If anyone knew they were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , O'Neill realized , its effects subsided quickly . Sweating and trembling still , O'Neill puzzled it ma : if you 're not sensitized to the stuff , it 's an ecstasy of terror . Mai/be  | it 's like that for the others , too , and they 're so used to it that they do n't notice . Maybe it 's like hitting your head against the alloy wall of the monastery . It feels so good when you stop you do n't remember what the pain was like . " Is it not a beautiful and refreshing ceremony , Honored Friend ? " asked Sammy briskly , as they threaded through the crowded streets toward their tower . " It is so peaceful . You are at one with Zylong , with your family , your friends , with the people , all the universe . You see what everything means and how tiny you are in that meaning . " She seemed in fine fettle . ( Just like Deirdre on Sunday morning . ) " What does everything mean ? " he asked innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded Ernie . " Perhaps you have to be a Zylongi to understand . " There was an unexpected benefit of Zylongday . Ernie referred to it as a " mild diversion " for a Zylongday afternoon . To O'Neill it was a picnic . After the worship service the City atmosphere was relaxed  --  a holiday spirit pervaded the air . Small wandering bands and orchestras played in the plazas and the squares . The sidewalk cafes were crowded . Streets were filled with people in brightly colored clothes , strolling together and chatting . Whatever was in the " communion " drug seemed to relax the formality and tensions of Zylong life . His hosts were more cheerful than usual . Sammy hummed a tune as she bounced around the living area preparing for their " diversion . " When they left their tower for the " short " walk to the wall , she changed to another tune and compelled O'Neill and Ernie to hum with her . The woman 's idea of " short " was not the same as Seamus 's . After the first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are young enough to be my son and strong enough to be a god . " She poked a finger at him . " Stop your complaining . " " I 'll complain as much as I want , woman . " Seamus put his hands around her waist , lifted her into the air as if she was a child , and spun her around , shouting and sputtering ,  | and then , when he thought she 'd had enough of her carnival ride , deposited her unceremoniously on the ground . Ernie and the other folks walking toward the wall seemed to think this was hilariously funny . Taran savage doing his Zylongday thing . Sammy was red-faced , dizzy , flustered , and exorbitantly pleased , truly the little girl-child he had for the moment made her . " You do strange things , Poet O'Neill , very strange things . " " You keep a proper tongue in your head , woman , " he laughed at her , " or I 'll do even stranger . " Everyone thought that was uproarious too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was breathing deeply still , wonderful breasts moving up and down rapidly . " We are almost at the wall . " " ' T is the walk home that worries me , " he protested . " We will ride home , Honored Guest . " Ernie did n't quite understand it was mostly a game . " Almost " meant fifteen more minutes on his now aching feet . He complained . Sammy made little faces at him but did not take the risk of another ride . Too bad , he 'd enjoyed it . Ah , sure nothing but a harmless little game , he told the Lady Abbess , just in case she was listening . The wall of the City was what Ernie called a " symbol , " a waist-high slab of gleaming pink alloy that circled the City ( doubtless produced in one of the mills of the spanking-clean factory center which O'Neill had visited earlier in the week ) . Panels swung open when you touched them . In time of conflict an electrical energy was released to make them effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did , to the mingled dismay and amusement of his hosts . " When do you shoot the current through it ? " Seamus tried to sound innocent . " In times of conflict , " Ernie said calmly . " And when do you have conflict in this well-ordered and peaceful place ? " His hosts were silent .  | " We do n't , of course . " Sammy began to walk along the wall , not looking at him . Her husband followed as he usually did when she led . " It is merely a precaution , " her husband added lamely . " Ah , indeed . " Seamus lifted his picnic basket , the heaviest because , as Sammy had explained , " you are by far the biggest , " and followed along , docile and dumb . At the nearest gate , an opening in the wall , at which two sleepy cops with rusty pikes stood guard , they entered a blockhouse and descended by elevator to one of the huge underground chambers that lay beneath the City . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the terminal there was a garage filled with the small electric cars that scurried through the City . Ernie 's status entitled him to the use of a car . He handed a token to the bored attendant . After trying two cars that refused to work , they found one that , with considerable effort , was persuaded to sputter into action . The bowels of the City , Seamus noted before he was distracted , were also the seamy side of the City . The obsessive cleanliness that was required aboveground did not seem necessary underground . The monorail station and the car park were littered with torn scraps of paper and unidentifiable rubble and permeated with a strong smell hinting broadly at human sewage . The monorail that arrived just as they were leaving seemed to limp wearily into the station . Even the docile Zylongi muttered angrily at what Seamus took to be the late arrival of the train . Underground you do n't even have to be patient and polite : even mine host and hostess are churlish with this dummy that ca n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seamus saw the Lady Deirdre herself get off the monorail train . At lea " t it looked like her , a tall , slim woman with black hair tinged with gray and a thin ascetic face , gentle yet determined . Like Marjetta might appear in , well , fifty years .  | Before Seamus could be certain , the woman slipped away in the crowd . It could n't be her , he told himself uneasily . Just my guilty conscience . Yes , it could . You know very well that like some of the other " sensitives " up there , she can project an image of herself that is almost as good as the real thing , almost anywhere she wants . Is n't she after doing it for laughs on the great festival days ? And is n't it after wearing her out too ? And what should she be doing down here ? Spying on her spy , you idjit , what else ? And why does the Lady Cardinal remind me of Margie ? Because they look a little like each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is there something wrong , Honored Poet ? " Sammy asked anxiously . " Ah , I thought I saw someone I knew , but sure it could n't be ? " " The Honored Lieutenant Marjetta ? " " Not exactly . Someone maybe sixty years older . But sure it was n't her at all , at all . " She does n't have lithe swelling breasts like my Margie . Well , not that I 've let myself notice anyway . And herself a Cardinal . The car started then , and they chugged up the ramp , out an opening beyond the City walls . " The day is so pleasant , " Ernie said , a broad smile on his face , " that I thought it would be diverting to leave the City . " The air was warm and dry , the sky completely cloudless , the sun a deep , rich rose . The scent of flowers was everywhere . Since there were n't any in sight , the odor must come from the low grasslike plant that grew on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , beneath the sweeping sandbanks that were upriver from the City . It is not paradise , but it will do . Sure , it could n't have been herself . You have a guilty/ conscience , ! hat 's zola ' , you have .  | I have n't done anything to be guilty about . Not yet , but you 're fixing to . Their car actually was a small hovercraft , bumping along on a cushion of air . Its motor needed a good tune-up . Doubtless the Repair Committee had assigned it a priority . Well , if it breaks down , I hope they do n't expect me to fix it . I 'm a poet , not a mechanic . Of course , the woman could have something else going on down here besides me . Maybe I 'm a pawn . The thought infuriated him . Ah , but you 've known that you were a pawn from the beginning , why let it upset you now and ruin your day ? The woman was up to no good , you can bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small gravel beach on the riverbank . The Island ( it had no other name ) lay in the River , roughly parallel to the City , perhaps two miles from it . So that 's where she wants to land , is it now ? Well , it 's not a terrible bad place , I suppose . It sure beats the blackness of hyperspace . Despite the beauty of the afternoon , there were only occasional small groups of Zylongi wandering around on the plain or sitting at the edge of the River . They seemed to keep close to the City walls when they ventured out for their Sunday , oops , Zylongday , picnics . Their hovercraft left the bank and sped across to a small cove on the Island . It was unusual in the topography of Zylong ? a low mountain rearing its head far away from the planet 's main chain . Some five miles long , it had hills , valleys , some flat meadows , tiny forests , creek beds , and wide orange sand beaches on every side . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Why do n't we just take it over ? We can tell these folks that the red-bearded god took a fancy to it . " May Jesus and Mary and Brigid be with this island , " Sammy said devoutly as they climbed out of the rickety hovercraft . " What did you say ? " Seamus could hardly believe his own hearing .  | " It is your blessing we learned from the Honored Marjetta , " Ernie remarked apologetically . " You are distressed that we use it ? It is sacrilegious ? " " Ah , no , " Seamus sighed loudly . Sure I should have thought about blessing the future site of the Iona . " The question is whether they would object , and they 're a lot more tolerant than we are . " " It is beautiful that your god has friends , " Sammy murmured piously . " Ah , lots of them , too many altogether . " They swam in the warm , buoyant River , drank la-ir in copious amounts , ate the nameless delicacies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Neill had a hard time keeping his eyes off Sammy since she handed him her toga almost the moment their skiff pulled up on the beach . The scanty lentat merely emphasized her seductive charms . Sammy was richer and fuller than Marjetta , though not so perfectly sculpted . Marjetta 's athletic grace challenged you , Sammy 's flowing figure invited you to the warmth of earth . Sure there 's room for both , is n't there ? Near nakedness for her culture meant only friendship ? before the Festival anyway ; she seemed to feel no shame lying on the hot sand , her heels digging little holes in the beach , between her husband and her friend , both of whom were as unclad as she . Ernie went for another swim . " Do you find my body pleasing , Honored Friend ? " she asked , laughing softly . He had been staring too intently . " I find you pleasing , Sammy , " he replied truthfully enough . He wondered what Marjetta would look like in a brief loincloth and banished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you speak the beautiful and the mysterious . " The grip of her fingers tightened . " You are far behind in your kisses . " " What do you mean by that ? " lie wondered about pulling his fingers away .  | " You said that patients and doctors exchange kisses twice a day . " " I never did . " " At the Body Center , you most certainly did . " " Ah , but that 's our custom , not yours . " " It is a good custom . " " I like this one better . " He repeated his spin-the-dollyin-the-air routine . Kissing , he decided as he whirled the delighted Sammy above his head , might be safer than this . Sure she might just as well have nothing on at all . So he laid her back down on the beach , laughing and gasping , and kissed her lightly , twice for good measure . O'Neill decided he needed a swim too . When he returned , his friends asked if he would permit them a brief stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wee nap . " He yawned and stretched . " The woman wakes me up while it 's still dark and now makes me hike halfway across this planet . The least she can do is let me catch forty winks . " That should convince them that I have no idea they 're going off somewhere and breaking the rules , the dirty things ! " Forty winks ? " Despite the softness of anticipation in her eyes , Sammy had to ask the question . " An idiom for a brief rest . " Sure I 'd never have thought herself would break the rules . I bet they have n't been doing it for long , either . Do you have to come over here or do you risk it late at night in your tower ? He was willing to wager that the security system shut down in Zylong when the lights went out , just like everything else . The Guardians probably did spot checks of bedrooms to keep everyone honest . You took your chances of ending up in the fire on Zylongday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you still did it . There were probably a lot of things the Committee did not want to know , because it could n't do anything about them anyway . Sammy and Ernie , however unsuited for each other they  | may have been when they " officially mated , " were now , it seemed obvious , deeply in love with one another . How could anyone expect them not to play with each other 's bodies ? He had learned in the monastery school about the Shakers , mostly because they composed such wonderful songs . Despite their music , they did themselves out of existence because they believed in celibacy not only for monks  --  which Seamus supposed was all right as long as it was your vocation , God knows it was n't his  --  but for married people too . And they made it work till there were no more Shakers and no more songs . They probably did shake because of the way they lived . It 'd be enough to make anyone shake . The songs were joyous enough , though , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then sang it for his hosts . They loved it . He taught them the words in their own language and they sang it with him . " It is indeed a gift to be free , " Ernie sighed wistfully . " A great gift . Almost as great ? " he took her hand " ? as a good wife . " Sammy blushed happily and clung to his hand . " We must take our walk now , Honored Poet . " " Have a nice walk . " Seamus could have kicked himself for that smart-aleck crack . They both blushed and turned away . So you can live like a Shaker if you have to and want to and your society and culture make you . Yeah , but most people ca n't . But they 've been doing it here . Or rather not doing it for a long time . All right , so it is possible . But it 's silly . Since Seamus was an orphan , Carmody had provided him with his sex instruction  --  God knows the monks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good teacher . It was said of his wife , Maeve , that she became more beautiful each year and , with a knowing wink , " You know what that means ! " The power of sexual attraction , Carmody had explained ,  | is that it keeps man and woman together , even though " they have no business trying to live in the same house and sleep in the same bed . Can you imagine a more difficult thing for two human beings and themselves as different as can be ? " Seamus admitted that he could not . " And sure , " the huge , grizzled Brigadier went on in his rich mischievous baritone , " just when you 're ready to murder the woman and long after she 's made up her mind to poison your coffee , you fall in love again and it 's the most glorious thing in all God 's world . " That seemed reasonable enough . " ' T is just like God feels about us , " Carmody observed , echoing the theories of Cardinal Deirdre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details for a fascinated Seamus . " Ah , He 's not that way at all , at all , " Seamus protested . " God is a spirit . " " Are you letting those gombeen men in the school teach you that nonsense ? Whoever said spirits do n't have passions ? God is daft over us . That 's what herself means when she preaches that marriage is a sacrament  --  it gives us a hint about what God is like . Sure , He 's even more crazy in love with us than we are with one another when we 're turned on . " " Go ' long with you , " Seamus said , dubious but delighted . " If God were like that , well ... " " Would I be misleading you now ? " Carmody had demanded . Sure he would not . Sex is a hint of God ? ' T is a nice idea . I 'll have to tell Marjetta the next time I see her . She seems kind of interested in our god . And when will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them to go sneaking off into the woods so they can lollygag with each other . Here I am , an enforced celibate , and myself not even a monk . The Tarans did not try to regulate the sex lives of their members . " We did try long ago , " the Abbess said crisply , " and it did n't work . "  | Premarital experimentation was frowned upon officially , but when it happened , there were sighs and comments like " Ah , the boys wo n't leave the girls alone . " Or vice versa . " The blood is hot at that age , " the Abbess would say . " And ' t is herself that would know about it , " some of her contemporaries would mutter behind her back . Extramarital sex was taken much more seriously because relationships were tough enough in the close quarters of a spaceship monastery on a pilgrimage that could last for decades . Men and women knew this and generally avoided complicating their own lives and other people 's . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants were careful not to get caught . And when they were caught ? " Sure they would n't have been caught unless they wanted to be , " the Abbess would complain  --  the emphasis was not on punishment or retribution but on " working things out . " Not that the Tarans had figured out how to make sex work . " The species has never done that at all , at all , " Carmody complained . " But at least we do n't have too many hang-ups and some of us ? " he smiled complacently " ? even manage to be good enough at it to enjoy the game now and again . " " Do you now ? " Seamus decided that he would be one of those . If only he could find the proper woman . Which had turned out to be a more difficult task than he had expected . Until the shapely shoulders of Marjetta had thrust themselves into his life . Shapely and strong , he thought , remembering ; after all , she pulled me out of the sewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glowing with satisfaction and complacency . So they , too , were good enough to enjoy the game . Good for them . Seamus pretended to be asleep so as not to embarrass them . Or himself . Finally , he made a great show of waking up and , without looking ; at them , announced that since he 'd been promised  | that he would not have to walk back to the tower , he would exhaust himself altogether with one last swim . The sun sank slowly into the horizon beyond the towers of the City , bathing it in gold and purple . The long haze of twilight settled peacefully on the River and the Island . After what must have been the fifth swim and their tenth round of la-ir , O'Neill and his hosts were collapsed in satisfied exhaustion on the sand by their skiff . Sammy spoke finally . " Good Friend O'Neill , we must ask you another personal question . " " All right ... I guess , " he agreed reluctantly . " You ask it , Gentle Mate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She dug her tiny heels more deeply into the sand . " We like the ' nicknames ' you have chosen for us . What do your good friends on Tara call you ? " the Music Director asked hesitantly . Images of Tessie and Fergus Hennessey flashed across his memory . " Ah , well , I suppose you must know that my very best friends , the people I grew up with , call me ' Jimmy . " Sammy clapped her hands . " Geemie  --  what a marvelously funny name . Oh , it is perfect for you . " Maybe by the end of these holidays all Zylongi get a little slaphappy . The day was over . Reluctantly " Geemie " and his hosts gathered their clothes and their picnic equipment together and lumbered their way back toward the other side of the River . He handed Sammy her robe . She smiled a bit wickedly , for her , as she slipped it around her body . " Yes , I must wear it , but modesty is tiresome with one 's friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you imagine what would happen if I said that up there ? He muttered a prayer to his patron St. James ( the Greater , of course ) that it really was n't herself lurking over at the monorail station . Not that there was any way of hiding from her when she wanted to keep her eyes on you . They were late returning to the City . Sammy and Ernie ,  | perhaps reluctant to face the rigid , formal style of their City life , delayed on the riverbank , treating each other with exaggerated gentleness . O'Neill supposed he should have been embarrassed . That Sammy and Ernie could turn the words of ordinary conversation into caresses did n't seem to fit the Zylongi personality . By the time they got to the garage , the attendant was gone , the underground lights were dim , the monorail station empty . Seamus was so sleepy from the exertions and emotions of the day that he paid no heed to his hosts ' nervousness as they waited for the monorail to respond to their signal . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned behind him and saw a knife slicing toward his throat . 8 Seamus was out of condition , weary from the day 's exercise , and long unpracticed in the skills of hand-to-hand combat . On the other hand , in addition to being a perhaps second-rate poet , he was one of the Wild Geese , the most respected warriors in the galaxy . " We Only Fight When We Have To " was one of their many mottoes . And another was " Do n't Make Us Mad . " Well , he had to fight now . And he was very mad indeed . These shitheads had been sneaking around behind him long enough . He quickly shifted his shoulders , ducked the knife , twisted it out of the hand of his assailant and threw him into the path of a second attacker . As the man crashed into the floor , Seamus heard a sickening thud . Ah , that 's the end of him , poor fellow . The second one rushed at Seamus with a big vicious pike , aiming straight at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into a corner , and charged again . Seamus had no choice but to plunge the knife into his heart and twist it out again savagely . That was that . In less than half a minute , two black-hooded figures were dead on the station platform . O'Neill , panting for breath , stood over them , a knife dripping with blood held tightly in his hand . These idjits with the hoods made the mistake of taking on someone trained to kill if lie had to . Sammy was screaming . Another hooded figure had her pinned to the wall , and a fourth had torn off her robe . Ernie  | lay unconscious , his head bleeding badly . O'Neill kicked an oncoming Hooded One in the stomach and sent him sprawling against the monorail car , which had appeared silently in the midst of the fight . He grabbed the two who were assaulting Sammy and cracked their skulls together . A quick knife thrust at the reviving attacker and there were five dead bodies on the platform . Ernie was still unconscious ; Sammy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shock . O'Neill grabbed her by the shoulders and yelled , " You look at Ernie , I 'll find the police ! " Sammy willed herself calmer . " No , not the police . It will be the end of us all . You must do exactly as I say , Geemie . I will explain later . " She bent over Ernie , touched his head , lifted his eyelids . She steadied herself against O'Neill 's arm . " It is bad , Geemie . If I do n't get life serum he will not survive  --  my beloved . Quick , or he will die ! " They pried open the door of the monorail car and lugged Ernie inside . They propped him up in the seat behind the control panel . " They are automatic this time of night , " she panted . " I think I can make it start . Get rid of those monsters . No , bring them on the car . And clean up the floor . " " Yes , ma'am . " Seamus hopped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an order . He dragged the five Hooded Ones into the car , used the remnants of Sammy and Ernie 's clothes and a spray container from the station wall to clean up most of the blood , and buried the blood-soaked garments in the bottom of an overstuffed trash container . Inside , Sammy was desperately pushing at buttons . O'Neill watched helplessly . Ernie was hardly breathing . A goner , Seamus thought to himself . Then the lights went out , the vehicle leaped forward . " I think I 've turned the override key for emergencies , " she shouted over the roar of the lumbering train . " It will take  | the car directly to the Body Institute ; no other station can stop or divert it . " " Is n't that nice now ? " The car plunged through the pitch-black tunnels , speeding by dimly lit stations , until it swerved to the left off the main line and entered the Body Institute 's underground complex . Using manual controls , Sammy guided the car through a number of sliding doors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy jumped out into the darkness and pressed a button on the wall . A panel slid aside to reveal a large , low-ceilinged chamber illuminated by a pale green light . Save for a walkway around its perimeter and what appeared to be a loading platform in front of the door , the entire room was a vat of thick , slowly bubbling liquid . It had the hideous smell of death . Sammy did n't hesitate . " Quick , Geemie , our lives are lost if anyone sees us ! " She began to pull one of the Hooded Ones toward the seething rolling substance . Seamus tried to remove the hood ; she stopped him . " We do not want to know who they are . That would be too much . " As the first body struck the surface , a hissing vapor arose and partially obscured the disintegration of skin over muscle , muscle over bone , and the skeleton itself in the caustic action of the acid . As each body followed the last , the vapor rose higher . When Seamus dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosted by a thick layer of sickly greenish cloud . Sammy rushed around the edge of the vat to a panel halfway across the room , exclaiming , " I 'm going to get serum for my mate ! " O'Neill spent interminable minutes in the dank underground chamber directing prayers to Yahweh , Brigid , Patrick , Columcile , Finnbar , James , Brendan , Kevin , and any other Celtic saints who might have been listening , sparing just a few moments to point out to Yahweh 's local representative , Deirdre Cardinal Fitzgerald ( a title to he used only when one  | wanted special psychic assistance ) that help in this particular instance would be most appropriate . No answer from any of them . Ernie 's eyes flickered dangerously ; his slight breathing became more labored . Not long to go . Seamus prayed all the harder . Sammy returned breathless with a large syringe in her hand . She plunged it into her mate 's chest . O'Neill watched anxiously as the fluid level went down . Sammy listened to his heart , her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ernie 's thin brown chest slowly become more regular ; the blood which was still reddening his iron-gray hair stopped flowing . Sammy stood up . " He lives , Geemie , " she said wearily , and collapsed sobbing into O'Neill 's arms . Slowly and gently he caressed her to peacefulness . After a moment 's relaxation , she dashed back into the chamber and pulled out fresh robes from a closet . Sammy quickly and skillfully guided the monorail car back into the main tunnel . So the Honored Poet and his hosts returned to the livingspace complex after a pleasant if slightly prolonged Zylongday outing on the Island . " A small accident with the car , " Sammy explained to a station attendant as they helped the now conscious but groggy Ernie out of the car and into the elevator of their living tower . " It is well that the trains run this late on Zylongday , " he replied with mild reproof . As they left the elevator , Sammy muttered , " He will report us , of course , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around this place , are n't there ? Later , in the privacy of their living space , while his mate began her ministrations to his skull , Ernie painfully filled O'Neill in on their attackers . " The Hooded Ones , " he said , " are not the same as ' those who are no longer with us . ' They are anarchists , not dissidents . They rarely appear in the daytime , although they have been seen more often at that time recently , it is reported . They attack after dark , then usually  | only isolated individuals or small groups like us . Recently the attacks have been both more vicious and more frequent . Their attacks are usually on the fringes of the City . Tonight 's attack , so near the main gate , was very unusual . Few people dare to go out after midnight because they fear attack . We were late coming back ; still , it was before midnight . " Those who are no longer with us , mused Seamus . There 's more damned categories of baddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why did n't we go to the police ? Why were we so afraid of being seen ? Why did we cover up traces of the attack ? as if we were guilty ? " O'Neill was baffled . " The Hooded Ones , " said Sammy , carefully stitching her mate 's wound , " do not exist officially . Some of them may live as ordinary citizens during the day , but many more live in the caves beneath the underground system  --  which also do not exist officially . It is not wise to talk about what does not exist in public . If one reports an attack from something that does not exist , one is causing trouble for the City . If the police are forced to encounter something that does not exist , whoever is responsible is an enemy of the City . They will likely end up in a vat like the one you saw . Geemie , we came very close to being there ourselves tonight . I was running down a corridor in the Body Institute with the life serum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor . It was lucky I did . There was a police patrol in the first one . Now , beloved , the stitching is over . " She touched his face with gentle affection . Seamus took a blind-leap guess . " Are the Hooded Ones the same as the Guardians ? " Sammy paused with a medicine bottle in her hand . Ernie spoke : " We do not think so , although it is said that the Hooded Ones think of themselves as ' Guardians of the Next Day . ' Of the ' New Reconstruction . " ' " Do they now ? "  | page deleted  | page deleted  |  | Seamus O'Neill , carbine at the ready , prowled the low hill just above Captain Pojoon 's encampment . There was no moonlight yet , only shadows against the stars . It was like blundering through the storerooms in the deep hold of the Iona , except that the only folks who lurked there were ghosts , so there was nothing to be afraid of if you did n't believe in ghosts . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light weapon which fired electrical charges that were strong enough to kill you if they hit you in a vital spot , not nearly as deadly as the automatic weapons or laser rifles the Wild Geese carried , but deadly enough . Seamus , of course , did believe in ghosts , but not in the same way that he believed in enemies lurking in the hills behind them . Ghosts could scare . The folks up in the hills might kill you . The Zylongi were too inept to set up camp in a proper place and too dumb to put out a proper system of guards . What a rotten bunch of soldiers . Herself was right : this society is falling apart . Sure they need help bad . And if it 's all the same to you , now would be the time to come and help them . And meself in the process . No word back . Not that he expected any . They 'd forgotten about Seamus Finnbar O'Neill . The woman had other irons in the fire . So they 'd sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one at taking care of himself . I le would have to assure his own safety . The camp was a few feet below him ; he could barely see the outline of the small tents that housed the troops . He  | yearned for the silver light from the tiny Zylong moons , billiard balls that bounced fretfully across the sky . The horses were invisible beyond the camp , but he could hear the nervous stamping of their hooves . Everyone but two guards was sound asleep . Nervously he fingered his gun . Perfect targets for an attack . An exposed camp with no pickets and no preparations for defense . " There are no dangers here at the foot of the mountains , " Pojoon said casually . " It is better that we get some sleep for tomorrow 's march . " Marjetta had no word of disagreement . Her attempts to turn the ragtag band of adolescent recruits into a marching column were cautious and discreet ; she did not want to embarrass her future mate by suggesting in front of the Honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pride , woman . That 's what it is . The terrible sin of pride . The sin of Eve . No , he got it wrong . Who was it that was guilty of the sin of pride ? He could n't quite remember . Well , it does n't matter . Pojoon is a bum . No match for Seamus O'Neill at all , at all , even if she pretends I do n't exist  --  and bad luck to her for doing that . He considered carefully and asked leave to revoke the final wish . Nothing but good luck to the poor girl . Sure , she 's had more than enough bad luck for one life . O'Neill had tried to sleep in the stuffy little tent , but his psychic sense and trained military brain told him that tonight danger was very near . He did n't have much psychic ability , but at least he could sniff danger . " A very useful trait in a Commandant , " the Lady Abbess had said dryly when she gave him his gold oak leaf badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver harp , of course . There was menace in these foothills whether the Zylongi proclaimed them officially safe or not . If an attack came , he would be ready for it , no matter what they did . Save Margie if no one else . Every noise among the rocks , every shift in the slight breeze increased his nervousness . He fingered the illumination grenade he had stolen from a store 's tent ; he hoped it worked . The carbine that Marjetta gave him when  | they were switching from hovercraft to horseback at the edge of the desert was old but well maintained . It had been her responsibility , she 'd told him curtly when he examined it ; it would work well . She wo n't look me in the eyes . Is she after blaming me for what happened that night ? Sure she was into it as much as I was . Seamus cautiously reopened the weapon to make sure it was not jammed . The woman told the truth . Sure she 'd be a good housewife , too , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to them for leaving me down here to be murdered in this terrible desert . Well , when whatever was going to happen did , he was n't going to have a jammed carbine on his hands . The Zylongi troops were young , most of them new recruits . Many had never been on a horse ( not that he had ever ridden one either  --  St. Patrick , how he ached ! ) . They could n't maintain a line of march for more than a half hour ; they had a hard time setting up their tents ; they went to bed even though they were in a dangerous situation ; they probably could n't fire a gun to save their lives  --  which they might have to do . Washouts , Seamus suspected , that the high command wants to eliminate . Along with Honored Poet Seamus Finnbar O'Neill , God be good to him . They had left the Military Center , just down the street from the main square of the City , while it was still dark , arriving at the departure station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage had been prepacked , it still was well into midmorning before Pojoon , Marjetta , and Retha , a frightened little-girl Cadet who looked like she was about eleven years old , managed to get the horses loaded . They proceeded out the Gate of Departure in something less than a trim line , with a small chorus of lame farewells from the garrison sounding behind them . They would not make the trip to Fort Hyperion by hovercraft , first because there were only a few such vehicles and  | secondly because none of them had the range required for the trip to the other end of the World Island . Seamus was n't sure he believed either claim . He suspected that those who ruled Zylong wanted to keep control of all the long-range transportation on the planet . The ride across the desert was hot but uneventful . By sunset of the second day , the weary and dispirited troopers arrived at the foothills of the vast mountain spine of Zylong . They saw the snow-capped peaks at the lower end of the chain far off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O'Neill paid little attention since he was preoccupied with the hapless efforts of the three officers to get their expedition settled for the night . They were not much of a command staff  --  a stupid Captain , a Lieutenant preoccupied with problems of her own , and a terrified girlchild Cadet . Seamus wondered who she had offended . If the Committee were sending out an expendable expedition , they did n't have to make it so obvious . Of course , they did n't know they had a Commandant of the Wild Geese on their hands . Or did they ? The heat lessened as dusk settled . Everyone continued to wear the hooded flowing garments that replaced the wraparound robe on desert marches . While it protected one from sun and sand , it gave little freedom of movement in a fight . These folks know nothing about fighting . Then why have an army ? O'Neill left his cloak in the tent and went out to prowl in his lentat , a knife stuck in its belt . The moons began to edge over the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense and businesslike on the surface but warm , sensuous , and yielding underneath . Margie was apparently pure rock all the way through , though delectable rock . There must be some kind of military tradition in Zylong . She was every inch a sophisticated , tough , and resourceful soldier  --  high-quality officer material even by Wild Geese standards . He wondered what she thought of her own army .  | The first news of this trip to the desert came two evenings after the fight at the monorail station . Seamus was trying to talk with the young serving hordi . She could understand him , but he could get nowhere with her clicks and grunts . Like most women , however , she found him hugely amusing . " You admire the good Dr. Samaritha ? " he began the conversation . The little creature clicked and grunted enthusiastically . " All these people ? " She shook her head in a vigorous negative . " Uh-huh . They kind of push around your people , do n't they ? " The small one looked anxiously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The day of the hordi will come , wo n't it ? " The servant chattered with terror , pointed at him , and ran from the room . The legend again . Why is she afraid ? Of course , when the wild hordi come in from the desert , it may be rough on the collaborators . This scene gets worse and worse . The normally dormant video screen in his room crackled and came alive . There was Marjetta on the screen , looking coldly at him . " Poet O'Neill , " she intoned , " the Committee thinks it proper to offer you the possibility of a journey to our mines at Fort Hyperion . My senior officer , Captain Pojoon , will lead a convoy there in three days . It should give you an opportunity to observe the countryside of our planet before the time comes for you to leave . Will it please you to accept the invitation ? " It did n't please Poet O'Neill very much at all . The Committee was serving notice on him that his days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a dubious expedition only two days after someone had tried to kill him . The Committee was issuing an order , not an invitation . If Marjetta noticed his suspicion about the journey to Fort I Iyperion  --  Odd liana ' . Greek , was n't it ? she did n't corn- ment on it . " You will come to the Military Center tomorrow at the third hour after the zenith and ask the guard to conduct you to my office for a preliminary briefing . Try to be punctual . " " Bitch , " sighed O'Neill , as she signed off . " But so lovely . " He had gone at once to seek Samaritha 's reaction to the invitation . He found her reading on a couch in her own room , the water steaming in the bath next to her . O'Neill was still not able to get used to seeing the good doctor naked to her flat luscious belly . Every time he saw her he felt he wanted to run  --  though he was n't quite sure whether to run toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the depths of her selfhood , an invitation that attracted and frightened him . She luxuriated in his admiration . " Ought not one to enjoy friends ? " she had asked him once with a mixture of naivete and coquettishness . " Is there something wrong with me , Geemie ? " she asked , putting aside the book . " Uh ... no , nothing at all . " If only his eyes would n't widen embarrassingly every time he saw her . " Come , Geemie , " she said invitingly , extending the tiny fingers of her right hand , " join me in a serenity bath . You will find it most restful . I think you 're afraid of me . You must know me well enough to realize I would do nothing improper . My mate himself suggested that you might need the relaxation . " She peeled off his robe and led him unresisting into the warm waters of the pool . " Is it really true that on Tara you hug friends instead of holding their fingers ? It would surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? " She laughed merrily and put his arms around her . She fit nicely ; there was surrender in her body . Glory be to God , Deirdre , the woman 's trying to seduce me ! Though there was no reply from Deirdre , Sammy was n't trying to seduce him . The serenity bath had the same effect as la-ir . It produced intimacy from which all passion was drained . The temperature of the bath varied subtly , shifting  | patterns of coolness and warmth over his body  --  passion fulfilled rather than passion aroused . One more of the Zylongian techniques for sexual control . " Geemie , " she said after a long time . Her eyes were filled with tears . " Musha , now , " he said . " There 's nothing to cry about . " " Why do n't you take Marjetta with you and leave this planet ? Go back to Tara . Have a life of joy and peace with your own people . " She buried her head against his chest . " Well now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , but I do n't think the young lady would be all that eager to step into my battered spacecraft . Sure , the old Dev is not the sort of thing to attract a woman with a career ahead of her like Marjetta . " He did n't want to get mixed up with that one . Besides , had she dragged him into the intimacy of her bath to sell Marjetta ? " No , you are wrong , Geemie . She will go with you . I know she will . You two would be very happy . You would find love much younger than I and my dear mate did . You must go . You must go soon . " She dug her fingers into his arms , desperately pleading with him to leave . While she spoke to him urgently , she was holding his head on her breast , gently stroking his hair . The rest of the universe slipped away ; there was only himself and this beautiful woman who had admitted him into the sanctuary of her love . He touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but under the gentleness of his fingers they became soft . He was falling , falling back into childhood . He was a little boy and she was a tender and loving mother . On the low hill in the desert , O'Neill realized he was perspiring despite the cool night air . There had been no aroused passion while he was in her soothing embrace but the memory of it made his body twist in pain . I am going to pieces . Wild Geese do not fantasize about women when they 're on battle alert . " There was a sound down the hill from him . Instantly he  | tensed his finger on the gun . Perhaps only a stone sliding into the plain . The plan for the journey to the desert was straightforward . A transport column of forty rather stodgy horses ( their ancestors , probably not thoroughbreds to begin with , must have come here with the original settlers ) and twenty soldiers with supplies would be conveyed to the edge of the jungle beyond the cultivated region by large transport ( bigger versions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jungle ) . They would move out across the desert to the mountain foothills , following them around to the fort on the southern tip of the continent . There they would unload the supplies , rest for a few days , collect the concentrated minerals used in alloy construction , and retrace their route home . The whole journey would take no more than two weeks  --  three at the most , should there be storms on the desert . Which was the first O'Neill had heard of any storms . Podraig , you goofed again . The trip could be completed several weeks before the harvest . It was simple enough  --  especially in a society which deliberately but capriciously limited its technology . On the one hand it used computers that were as good as any on the Iona , and provided electricity for the City from an old-fashioned nuclear reactor in the Energy Center ; it could produce an elaborate monorail system inside the City and alloy metals , rock-hard , for buildings and walls . But it brought in raw materials and supplies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any distance , belonged , he had been told , to " the Committee " and was used only for " official purposes . " Ernie explained that it would " violate " the harmony of the land to use big machines outside the City . The explanation was delivered in what Seamus had come to recognize as the " civic " tone of his host 's voice  --  a tone reserved for the " party line , " which the good Musical Director did not necessarily believe . Seamus guessed that banning technology from the coun- try kept its resources under control of the Committee and protected ordinary Zylongi ( For their own good , of course , he thought bitterly ) from contact with the wild hordi or the other " monsters " ( Carina 's word , spoken in the only sentence that Sammy 's sullen little future daughter-in-law had spoken to O'Neill ) who lived in the wilderness . " And Narth ! " the angry little child had added . " Who 's he ? " She shook her pretty head disdainfully and walked to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation " he went to the Body Institute for inoculation against diseases on the trip . The Zylongi had brought disease under control in the area around their City and in the cultivated region ; in the desert it was another matter . Sammy was very businesslike . She had no idea what the diseases were ; the Inoculation Department was not connected with hers . Their research was not published . Still , everyone knew the serums were very effective . There was no need to worry about infection on the journey . " Do people like you and Ernie really like the Festival ? " he asked abruptly , remembering that he was supposed to be on an intelligence mission . " Do n't you hate sharing your mate with others ? " Sammy turned her back and put one of the bottles of vaccine into the refrigerated wall safe from which she had taken it . She stood ramrod-straight . " Of course we hate it . Do you think I like to feel the crude hands of the workers paw me ? Do you think I enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate ? It is unbearable . It happens . There is nothing to do . The Festival is part of our culture . It is in our bodies ; we are prisoners to it . We must endure it . " She whirled around , her eyes blazed with fury . " Are you satisfied now , Seamus O'Neill ? " she screamed at him . " Do you know everything about us that you wanted to know ? " Relentlessly he probed on . " Then the time you have with one another ( luring the second half of the Festival must he  | very unsatisfying . People like you and Ernie , who really care about each other , will cheat . I bet you break the rules no matter how virtuous you claim to be . I bet you broke them the night I saved your lives down in the underground . " She threw the empty syringe at him and ran sobbing from the room . Seamus sighed . Well , it does indeed look like they are coming apart at the seams . I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out . I hate myself for doing it . Sammy and Ernie were mournful when it came time to say farewell . " They can not do it , " she wailed . " We had an agreement .... " " They can do what they want , my dear , " Ernie replied grimly , wiping his hands nervously against his robe . " You know that . " " Ah , do n't be after worrying about me . " Seamus waved his hand airily . " Sure this space tramp can take care of himself . Why did I ever tell you about what happened in the bar on Halley Number Three when the wee gombeen man ... " He went off on another one of the stories , utterly fictional , like the one with which he had calmed his friends after the rumble in the monorail station . " You certainly displayed your ability to defend yourself the other night . " Ernie raised his la-ir glass respectfully . " I was not , ah , in a condition to observe , but from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior skills . " " He is a fearsome fighter . " Sammy eyed him keenly . " Are poets also warriors in Taran culture , Geemie ? " " Not at all , at all , " Seamus lied flatly . " I 'm not much of a fighter . You should see our real warriors . They 're called Wild Geese . There was a time when one of them and I were in a tight spot on Kerry and ... " So it went . He had been quickly forgiven for the scene in the Body Institute . Sammy embraced him fiercely and kissed him passionately when she dropped him off at t1w Military ( enter .  | " If you are gone three weeks , Geemie , I will owe you sixty kisses when you return . " " At least . In our culture , the rate goes up when the patient is away from the doctor . " She does n't believe , she never did . She merely likes to kiss me . Well , is n't that interesting . His reflections were abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the farewell embrace . Well , it 's your own fault , woman , for not staying in your office , like you said you would . He covered up his embarrassment by striding over to the younger woman and demanding the " truth " about the dangers in their trip . " There are no dangers . " She would not look at him . " It 's a routine mission . " " Wild hordi ? " " Some . They are not a threat . " " How many ? " " Officially there are only a couple of thousand of them in the whole world . " " I do n't want the official line . " He grabbed her arm roughly . " I want the truth . " " Most of them are unarmed and afraid of us . " She wrenched away from him . " I suppose that there may be tens , even hundreds of thousands of them , but they are not dangerous , save to cowards who are afraid of the child 's tale that they eat humans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to you ? " she glared at him contemptuously . " A few harmless mutants . " " Armed ? " " A couple of old-fashioned weapons . " " Zylongi ? " " You have no right to question me , Poet O'Neill . I will protect you . Let go of my arm . I thought I made it clear that I found physical contact with you distasteful . "  | " That 's a new song . " " Very well , there are some exiles out there and some descendants of earlier civilizations . I do not discuss such matters . Now if you 'll excuse me ? " " After you tell me who Narth is . " " He does not exist . " She turned on her heels and strode away . All of it , Seamus told himself that night in the desert , while he tried to guard the camp , was lies . She had lied to me and did not even bother to hide the fact that she was lying . Lulled by the images of two beautiful women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hillside . Something like an alarm bell sounded in his head . He woke with a start and threw the illumination grenade . The scene that was revealed in the split second before he began to fire the carbine was like a stop-action film . The hordi band and their Zylongi allies were caught just after the moment of attack . The startled aborigines , clicking and grunting in terrifying rhythms , raced toward the camp , waving long , deadly spears as they charged . Behind them rumbled huge hairy creatures , bent , misshapen , terrible , with big flat broadswords . The monsters moved slowly but they were so large that one blow could wipe out three or four Zylongi kids . Behind them came the cavalry , smartly uniformed soldiers on excellent horses carrying long , heavy lances , right out of one of the very old films about the West from the Earth film museum . What the hell are these troopers doing out here ? The woman did n't tell me a bit of truth . Exploding light and O'Neill 's rifle fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under orders , no doubt , to avoid organized conflict . The hordi raced into the fringes of the camp , where they were met by a devastating volley of carbine fire . I woke them up , O'Neill thought grimly . In the nick of time . He tossed another illumination grenade and continued to fire into the ranks of the attacking warriors . I le was sym- pathetic to their cause , but such attacks would not bring peace to Zylong . Besides , somehow , the troops in the camp were his , almost as much as was his squadron of Wild Geese . Disoriented into panic by the flaring lights and the unexpected resistance , the hordi fled , leaving their taller and more frightening allies to withdraw in slightly better order , carrying off armloads of equipment from the camp . The carbines of the camp were silent . " Carbines ! " exclaimed O'Neill in despair . " The fools are letting them get away with the guns ! " He ran down the slope toward the camp . By now the light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soldiers were milling about in panic . Retha , her cloak ripped to shreds , was crumpled up on the desert floor by the tent she shared with Marjetta , sobbing hysterically . Sergeant Markos was holding onto his bloody arm , swearing with greater skill than O'Neill would have expected from a Zylongi , even a Zylongi noncom . He shook the man . " Where 's Pojoon ? " " Dead , " grimaced the Sergeant , obviously in great pain . " Marjetta ? " " They 've got her . " " You must have shot the one who had me , " sobbed the hysterical Cadet . " We 're finished , " moaned the Sergeant . " Destroyed . They got every gun but mine . " " What will they do to Marjetta ? " O'Neill hardly dared to ask it . " They 'll cook her . What else do you think hordi do with captives ? They 're cannibals . " Sergeant Markos was desperate with pain and anger . Retha 's wails reached a nightmare pitch . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with a wounded Sergeant and a hysterical junior officer . He picked Retha off the ground and clobbered her . " Look , you little coward , you had better forget that you 're not qualified to command , or none of us will ever get back to the City alive . You 're the commanding officer of this unit  | now . If you do n't have the kind of defense perimeter you read about in the textbook when I come back , I 'll personally boil you slowly in oil ! " He then dumped her on the ground . Much to his surprise he heard her barking orders in her tiny voice behind him as he started up the hill . Poor kid . How do you arrange a defense perimeter when all you have to fight with are carbines and some discarded spears ? O'Neill did not use his light as he stumbled up the steep barren hills . He trusted to his dubious psychic instinct to discover where in the vast night Marjetta was being held . Just when he needed it , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate searching and uncounted curses aimed at the Lady Cardinal , he collapsed , cold , tired , and discouraged . He had climbed well into the foothills now and found no trace of hordi or their companions , those big ugly hairy monsters he had glimpsed in the glare of the illumination grenade . Marjetta is gone . I 'd better give up and go back . Why did she , a competent officer destined for responsibility , come on this expedition ? O'Neill shook his head . Did she know that her chances to survive this trip were nil ? Did she seek such an end ? Probably . She sounded like she valued neither herself nor her life that evening in the room , almost as though she did n't care whether I raped her or not . Perhaps the woman did n't want to live . He sighed . And she was still the proper woman . People die on pilgrimage . You mourn them . You remember them . And you go on . Someday you 'll meet them again and have a drink and laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thought that the drink or laughter would be excluded from the kingdom of heaven . He said a prayer for her and asked her to forgive him for giving up . He was a soldier and he had his duty  --  Even if those idjits on Iona have forgotten about me . As he started down the depression reaching back toward the ridge that pointed to camp , O'NeiII stopped for a moment THE FINAL PLANET / 135 and looked along the slight valley . For a fleeting moment he thought he saw a light flicker . A camp fire ? He eased himself back up on the ridge . Careful not to dislodge any loose rock , he crept along the top . At the end of it , where it linked to the next ridge , the valley below deepened into a steep ravine . At the bottom was the mouth of a cave obscured by a rock at one side . Gingerly O'Neill slipped down into the ravine . Edging around the rock and peering into the eerily lit cave , O'Neill saw two naked hordi women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone knife to prepare a spit . Outlined against the wall were a number of childish heads . At first , no sign of Marjetta . I could wipe out the whole bunch of them , but that would n't bring her back . Besides , I do n't know if they 're the ones who attacked us . Then he saw her . At the back end of the cave , stripped , bound and gagged , and suspended from a rock outcropping , like a slaughtered steer . Is she still alive ? They have n't skinned her , have they ? Well , there 's only one way to find out . The hordi were babbling away softly to one another , expecting , no doubt , a very succulent meal . He could smell the hot coals on their campfire . If he fired into the cave he could easily kill Marjetta with a ricocheting bullet . He reached for the knife that was a souvenir from the monorail incident and reversed the carbine to make it a club . I kind of outweigh them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath and mumbling a short prayer , he plunged into the cave , screaming like an angry and injured banshee . The hordi were terrified at the sight of a red-bearded giant . Two quick shoves with the rifle butt and the females were cowering against the wall , their bodies protecting the children . The male hordi was braver ; he turned toward O'Neill with the stone knife in his hand . O'Neill felt a moment of sympathy with the little creature ; he stood his ground in defense of his home , family , and provisions . One fast  | swing of the rifle knocked the stone from the hordi 's hand ; a solid poke with the right fist and Marjetta 's captor was out of action for a couple of hours . He slashed the coarse rope that attached her to the rock , tossed her over his shoulder , grabbed a carbine and a heavy sack that lay on the floor , and left the cave . Marjetta was conscious . Her struggling body impeded his progress as he ran through the ravine and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her muffled shrieks suggested that she might want to say something ; so , at a safe distance from the cave , O'Neill paused long enough to pull the gag from her mouth . " Put me down you fool . Untie me ! " she ordered . " Where have you been ? Why did it take so long for you to find me ? " " Well , that 's gratitude for you . " In exasperation he dumped her rudely to the ground . " We do n't have time to stop . They 'll follow us or raise the alarm and get the whole tribe down on us . " " They will not , you idiot . I know what the she-demons were screaming . They think you are some great red god . It will be days before they dare leave the cave . We can go much more quickly if you are not carrying me . " Then softly she added , " You need not feel obliged to tell me about the Captain . I saw him as they were dragging me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or congratulations ? O'Neill wondered . She stumbled on , her voice wavering , " He was a good man , O'Neill . He . . . he deserved better than me . " Not knowing what to say , O'Neill coldly suggested they climb the next ridge . From higher ground they could get a view of the desert in the now gray night just before dawn . Silently Marjetta stumbled up the slope behind him on legs stiff from the lack of circulation . At the top they could see the lower hills leading to the desert . O'Neill pointed silently toward where he thought the camp was . Marietta nodded .  | " But , O'Neill , what is that light behind us ? " He turned and saw a glow rising from the other side of the ridge , perhaps two hundred yards away . They picked their way cautiously through the boulders around a great rock to peer into the next valley . Marjetta clutched his arm . The valley before them was a wide circular hollow more than a mile in diameter , reaching deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occupied by a tent city , illuminated by many glittering camp fires . Though most of the occupants were apparently asleep , O'Neill and Marjetta could see occasional armed bands of hordi and Zylongi patrolling the perimeters . This was a serious military position , commanded by tough-minded professionals . In the center was a compound of larger tents . Here a large armed guard was posted , their spears angled away from their bodies ready for action . O'Neill estimated that there must be at least seven thousand warriors , maybe ten thousand . Later , preoccupied about other problems , he would forget the existence of this army , not that when they finally intervened there was much he could have done about them . Marjetta leaned against a large rock . " Narth 's camp , " she murmured , " not more than a day 's march from the cultivated regions . Only three days from the City itself . " Although it was hardly the place for a lesson in Zylongian history , nevertheless O'Neill announced bluntly that he would not take one more step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am unclad , " Marjetta protested . " That is unfortunate , but it 's dark , and just now I 'm not interested in your body , as admirable as it may be and as delightful as arguably it could be under other circumstances . " That should put her down , " Right now all I want is the truth . And if I do n't get the truth , all the easier to put you over my knee and give you the spanking you 've been asking for since ... " " Since I saw you kissing the Research Director . " The woman actually had the audacity to laugh at his threat . " Very well , I will tell you what I know . I warn you , however , there is much that I do n't know . Even the highest officers can not be aware that Narth is so near . " " Talk , " Seamus ordered . So she talked , concisely , lucidly , like the good soldier she was . Seamus was almost prepared to forgive her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various ways of dealing with those who threatened to disrupt their civilization . Some " went to the god " at the Festival  --  those who were defective , mentally ill , or too old . Others  --  those considered socially disruptive  --  disappeared into the acid vats . Some were too important or too well known to suffer either fate . They were publicly thrust out of the City in a solemn ceremony . They were what Sammy and Ernie had called " no longer with us . " Those who did n't die in the desert or the jungle survived in small communities that struggled to exist off tiny patches of cultivable ground and an occasional meat hunt .  | The hairy creatures O'Neill saw during the attack on their camp were mutants , the result of mistakes in the computer-programmed genetic manipulations . They were exposed to die outside in the cultivated areas . The hordi , however , considered these deformed creatures to be sacred and saved as many as they could , producing another race of humanoid type on the planet . They were smarter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . The wild hordi , once considered numerically depleted to the point of extinction , seemed to be regenerating . They hated the City folk and killed them whenever possible , then ate their flesh in the hope of absorbing their strength . " A fate from which you bravely saved me . " " Uhm . Keep talking . " The hordi preferred the wetter , hotter , and lush regions on the other side of the mountains and existed in uneasy truce with the exiled Zylongi , who lived on the side of the mountain facing the desert . Both groups sometimes combined to make forays into the desert to raid ore trains , though they never crossed the banks of the River . Five years ago , Marjetta told him , a brilliant Zylongi General was sent into exile for plotting revolution . " He was one of my teachers , a demented man , but one with a vision that many of us found attractive . He wanted to clean away the Committees and make himself Emperor . Then he would restore all the old freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silence in the darkness opposite him . Then a tentative answer . " I do n't expect to live long enough for it to matter , but no , an emperor , especially one like Narth , would merely exchange one form of tyranny for another . I want freedom . " Do you now ? So after all these years , people down here know what it is . I hope you 're listening up there , Lady Deirdre , and admiring my taste in women at that . Aloud he said , " Keep talking . " Narth was not docile at his exile ceremony , but threat- ened to come back and destroy the City . Since he had left , it was rumored that he had rallied the three outcast groups under his single command . The existence of such a union ( indeed the existence of the groups themselves ) was officially denied . Most Zylongi went about their daily lives convinced that the legends about Narth 's " empire " were not to be taken seriously . Thus , poor Dr. Samaritha kept trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savage variety was virtually extinct . " Does the Committee know that Narth 's army is this close to the City ? " O'Neill asked , trying to absorb all the startling new information . " Of course they know it . You do not think those sensors at the departure point would miss such a mass of people ? That is why they sent us on this expedition . They knew that Narth would go after our carbines . They expected we would all be killed . " " They were after me ? " He leaned against the rock too . " Surely a man of even your meager intelligence must have perceived that they were after me . There is a lot of unrest in my generation . You saw Horor and Carina . Well , there are hundreds like them . The Committee knows I have not joined them . Not yet . " The Committee also knows that if I overcome my hesitation , I might be a dangerous rebel . So I had to die ? and Pojoon , and Retha , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to get rid of you , too , but could have done that much more easily . Since I do not care about life , I came . They may even have sent word to Narth about the opportunity . What are a few carbines in exchange for one potential revolutionary leader whose family background protects her as long as she is in the City ? " There was no bitterness in her voice , rather she spoke with something close to despair . " You 're risking the back of me hand , woman , with those comments on my intelligence . But tell me now , if  | Narth can never hope to capture the City , why does he come so close ? " How did I ever get mixed up in this mess ? Get me out of here . This is n't our war . Of course bring the woman with me , we 'll give her more freedom than she ever dreamed of , too much freedom altogether . " Perhaps he thinks that during the time of the Festival the laser weapon controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only serious defense we have against all the Outsiders , not that I am confident they would work if we were forced to use them . I know you did n't see them ; no one except the fools who command the army are supposed to see them . They are buried behind the wall and are supposed to break through the ground and begin firing at the touch of a button . " " And you 've never seen them tested . " " Only pictures . They appear to be devastating . The Outsiders fear them greatly . However , the Festivals have become much wilder in the last few years . Maybe the Hooded Ones are in league with Narth ; they could destroy the lasers . Narth must have the Committee very worried . I do not blame them ; he is a fierce and terrible man . " Marjetta shivered . " He 'd be after wanting you ? " " He would . " " Well , he 's not going to get you , do you understand that , woman ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now what does that mean ? It does n't sound like a nasty crack . " ' T is a wise and prudent attitude . " O'Neill considered . His war was not with Narth or with Zylong . He was a spy for the Iona , which he hoped was still orbiting around up there planning emergency procedures to extricate him and Marjetta from this sinister planet . His first and principal loyalty was to his regiment and the pilgrimage . Marjetta interrupted his thoughts , clutching at his arm again . " O'Neill , look ! A raiding party . " I le could see in the increasing light a group of six big ,  | grotesque , hair-covered monsters moving single file along the ridge . They were laden with guns and coming right toward them . " Our carbines , " he said , flipping the safety switch on his own . " Does the silencer impede the efficiency of these relics ? " " Not at the range we are going to be shooting , " she replied tersely . " I 'll start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Those creatures seem to react slowly , but we ca n't take any chances . When I say shoot , you 'd better do it or those young troopers will be dead before another sunrise . Retha will be a tasty morsel for some hordi . " She shot , all right . Her bullets were as accurate as O'Neill 's . The monsters died quietly . Poor things , O'Neill thought compassionately . I do n't like killing you . I 'll buy the drinks when we meet further on . Well , the first round anyway . They quickly collected the carbines and climbed back across the hills toward the camp . When they arrived at the last low ridge just above the Zylongi camp , Marjetta whistled . There was a faint response . " It is all right , " she whispered in his ear . " Retha knows it is I. " The young soldiers , grimly holding their spears , were deployed behind a small rise of rocks above the camp . The Sergeant was patched up but still looked badly battered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the two of them appear in the early light of dawn , she rushed forward to throw a cloak around Marjetta 's bare shoulders ( at which O'Neill had resolutely refused to look , to say nothing of looking at the rest of her  --  well , maybe a wee glance ) and take the heavy sack of carbines out of her arms . The troops were ready for battle , and though they could never have lasted long against any kind of effective attack , they looked like they would give a good account of themselves . Retha 's disciplined air wavered for a moment when it looked like she would hug her commander . " It is good that you are back , I lonored lieutenant . "  | " It is not unpleasant to be back , " Marjetta responded with equal formality . " And not me ? " O'Neill demanded . Retha turned away , flustered and ashamed . " Of course , Honored Poet who saves everyone . What would we do without you ? " " Well , at least someone around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was supposed to know nothing about military matters , O'Neill suggested that the now rearmed Zylongi troopers deploy themselves on the low hill . With fires burning at the campsite , they would be able to trap the next raiding party before it knew what hit them . Marjetta fixed him with a long , inscrutable stare , then nodded . " Those are excellent tactics , Poet O'Neill . " At high noon Narth sent a good-sized unit to wipe them out  --  a troop of monsters mounted on horses and a company of hordi armed with spears . The cavalry was inept . They allowed their mounts to bolt at the first volley , leaving the hordi at the mercy of the Zylongis ' concentrated fire . At the end , thirty to forty dead and dying hordi lay inside the encampment with not a single Zylongi trooper wounded . Narth himself appeared on the ridge just out of carbine range . He was clad in a flaming crimson robe , surrounded by a crowd of horsemen . O'Neill bet they were the pick of the exiled families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space of open ridge between him and the Zylongi troopers , who were now exhausted and let down after their success . A classic cavalry charge would have cut up the Zylongi . O'Neill could see Narth 's fist raised in defiant fury and imagined the contorted face beneath his full black beard . Unwilling to risk further losses , the Emperor Narth turned and rode off down the ridge into the light of the risen sun . Chicken , thought O'Neill contemptuously . No match for the Wild Geese . Acting very much like commanding officer , O'Neill  | called Retha , Marjetta , and Sergeant Markos into conference . " Margie , " he began briskly , giving up all attempts at Zylongi formality , " you told me last night that the hordi do n't venture into the desert . Are they afraid of it ? " She nodded . O'Neill continued . " Our only chance is to run for Hyperion . . . to try to get back to the departure point will bring us much closer to the mountains , where they might be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have to change our route , head directly for the ocean , and then follow its shore around to the fort . It 'll be longer that way , but we 'll only have to watch one flank . The hordi wo n't come that far out into the desert . If our friend Narth comes after us with his pony soldiers , we 'll be able to see him coming . " He turned to Marjetta . " How long before we reach the fort ? " " Two days on horseback , " said Marjetta . " We have no horses , " said Retha , timidly . " So we 'll have to walk . That should double the time . Add two more days for safety and we have six days , right ? " All nodded except Marjetta , who sat very still and looked at him suspiciously . O'Neill knew he was causing warning lights to go on in her head . The woman was no fool . Not at all , at all . " Pack enough food and water , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ammunition for two long firefights . Destroy everything else . If there 's any room for more in our packs , make it water . We should be moving in two hours . " O'Neill stood up . The others sat for a moment confused , not knowing whether to obey his commands or to defer to Marjetta , their commanding officer . Marjetta repeated , " We move in two hours , as Captain O'Neill suggests . " Major if it comes to it . Aloud he said softly , " Thanks for the promotion , Margie , but Poet O'Neill will do . " She looked like she did n't believe a word of it . That night , when the camp had settled down except for  | the alert watchers Marjetta had stationed on the high ground , O'Neill was stirred from a deep sleep by a most unpleasant sensation . The long march through the desert had exhausted him . A man had a right to his sleep , damn it . He ignored the unpleasantness  --  until he heard a voice saying coldly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your sleep . " It was enough to wake a man , all right . He tentatively opened one eye . Marjetta 's cold , angry face was outlined in the glow of the portable light that hung from the tent pole . Her carbine prodded his stomach . " Musha , woman , a man needs his sleep . Put that thing away . We 'll worry about whatever 's on your mind in the morning . " He closed his eyes and rolled over . " Oh no , we will not . You are going to tell me the truth now or I will kill you , " she told him , sternly . " I do not like to kill , but I have done enough of it today not to mind one more . " The girl meant it . Seamus stirred himself to full consciousness , looked at the long steady line of the gun barrel and muttered , " Woman , you 've taken leave of your senses . " " You told me when we first met that you were not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came into the MC you acted like a soldier , you kept a soldier 's lookout at the camp last night , you organized a soldier 's ambush this morning , you laid out a marching plan that only a soldier could have thought of . An experienced and able soldier at that . " Oh , Lord , is she mad ! " Well , now , that 's a mighty conclusion you 've jumped to , " he tried to get her off the track with an argument , " if you take my meaning . " " You are wasting my time , O'Neill . You do not have much of your own left . What are you doing here ? Why did you lie to me ? To Samaritha and Ornigon ? I want the truth this time . " She jabbed him again with the carbine barrel . Ile rubbed the sleep out of his eyes . There were so many better things to he doing with a proper young woman like her at this time of the night .  | " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because then I would have had to explain why I was n't one anymore . I guess I was afraid that you would feel contempt for me . I did n't want you to know I was cashiered . " I 'll appeal to her sense of compassion , that 's what 1 ' 11 do , though I have n't noticed her having much of it . " Why were you cashiered ? " she barked at him . No compassion there . The next question would be why the original mind probe at the Body Institute had not found out about this supposed disgrace . He answered the unspoken question first to throw her off stride . " I do n't know why your mind probe did n't pick it up . Maybe because on Tara when they throw you out of the officer corps , they deprogram you . You remember some of your training but you forget your career completely . " The gun went down a fraction of an inch . Good , I 've got her curious . " It had something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a political thing , that the trial was rigged . There was nothing I could do about it . I was a Commandant , by the way . A Major . " Well , a man was entitled to a little vanity , was n't he ? Sure you just want to impress her . And why not ? " Do you work for the Committee ? " The muzzle of the gun was back in his stomach . O'Neill was stunned . " Glory be to God , why should I work for those Amadons ? " " The Hooded Ones ? " she persisted . " The anarchist hoo-ligans ? " " Did n't Sammy tell you about the fight on Zylongday ? " " Yes , a little , " came the grudging response . " The Young Ones ? " " The who ? " " The student and military radicals  --  Horor , Carina , Yens , and others . You seemed friendly with Horor . " " Not aII that friendly , " protested O'Neill . ' I never felt  | overwhelmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Retha 's programmed mate . He is one of the Council of the Young Ones . " " Do I look like someone who would get mixed up with a bunch of half-baked kids ? " He tried to sound angry and in the process he found himself getting very angry indeed . The damn bitch . " The Fourth Secretary  --  he is the Committee for all practical purposes  --  is very much afraid of them . They are the Technicians who will administer the City in a few years . " " I do n't care what that gombeen man fears . I 'm not involved in any of your nonsense . " " So you are not part of any of them ? " The carbine was almost in a position where he might survive the first shot . " I hate to mention it , but I did save you from the hordi supper table last night  --  a fact that seems to have escaped Your Ladyship 's attention . " " That could have been part of the plot , " she responded stubbornly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me girl , maybe it is all a plot . You 're either going to shoot me or not . Decide for yourself . If you think you 're going to be able to bring these kids of yours down to Hyperion with just the help of a bangedup old noncom and a kid who should be in the classroom , you 're crazy . Maybe you do n't want to trust me ; I do n't care much , but you 've got to trust someone . I 'm the only one around who can be of much help . Now get out of my tent unless you have foul designs on my body  --  in which case , welcome . I need some sleep . " He rolled over , moderately confident that she would n't shoot . " O'Neill .. . ? " Her voice came plaintively from the entrance of the tent . " What now ? " he demanded impatiently . Got her ! " I am thankful to you for rescuing me from the ... uh ... supper table . " " Well , praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umcile , it only took twenty-four hours to get it out of your mouth . " " May all those wonderful friends of your god be with this tent . " Well , now was n't that nice . And so poor Retha 's on this crazy adventure because she 's a dangerous revolutionary . I 've seen more dangerous firebrands in the nursery on the Iona . It was long after dark on the next day when they crossed the line of dunes that separated beach from desert . The ocean water looked inviting , serene blue , topped by great white rolling surf . But it was bitter cold , so there was no refreshment there . O'Neill contemplated what lay before them . It was still a long walk to Hyperion . All they had to fear was the Committee , Narth , the Young Ones , the Hooded Ones , the hordi . How many other dangers were there that no one had seen fit to tell him about ? Margie said the commander of the fort was a man of the highest integrity who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be respite there . Even if they made it , they were bound to return to the City . O'Neill yearned for just one small gunship , the Tom Doherty perhaps , a speedy and powerful craft , to help blast this whole planet into shape . Deirdre , My Lady , how did you get me into this ? ... There 's no answer . There never is . You 've forgotten about me altogether . The next morning he was in deeper than ever . Margie came up to him as they were breaking camp . " Come down to the shore with me , " she said briskly . " Ah , now , that 's an invitation no man in his right mind would refuse . " " You were truly a Major on Tara ? " she asked bluntly . " Hmmm ? " He tossed a clump of sand into the surf . " I mean before you were cashiered . Or were you lying about that too ? " He had nothing against telling the truth when he could afford it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Major . And , "  | he added irritably , " I do n't care , my bitchy friend , whether you believe me or not . " " I do not think I want to ask what a bitch is . How old are you ? " " Let me see , twenty-five of our years , that makes about thirty of your years . " " That makes you five of our years older than I am . " " Too much older ? " he demanded . " Oh , not at all ? " Was that a faint smile ? " ? but is n't that very young for such a rank ? " " Customs are different , " he said shortly . " But still ... " " All right , have it your way . Yes , it was very young . The thought seemed to be that I was a very good soldier . " All of which was true enough , but it was poet he was meant to be . " That 's beyond a doubt . " She nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced commander than I am . If you rose to such a rank so young , a much better one . I am going to trust you  --  as you said , I have no choice . You must be in charge . And one more thing , Major O'Neill . . . " " Ah , musha , you 'll find me a very democratic CO . You can call me Jimmy . " Tight-lipped , hands on her hips , she ignored his offer of friendship . " I am technically a widow now , even though Pojoon was only my intended mate . I do not have to seek another ; I do not intend to do so for a long time  --  perhaps never . I will not accept any suggestions in that direction . Do I make myself clear ? " Her pretty face was hard , her brown eyes stern . " What makes you think I 'd even be interested ? " he demanded . She smiled faintly again . " That 's right , I 'm a bitch . I presume that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned on her heel and strode back toward the ramp .  | " Well , as to that , it all depends , " Seamus shouted after her . She did not waver . Ah , and the woman does have a lovely ass on her , does n't she ? Sure there 's a lot better things to do with it than spank it . The threat will be enough . He then reprimanded himself for having such thoughts about a fellow officer in time of battle . The thoughts did not leave him however . Not at all , at all . Giving him the command changed her attitude . Later that day she relaxed and smiled , and by the second day was joking with the troops , making them laugh . With him , however , she was deadly serious . That 's fine with me , woman . I want no part of the likes of you , wonderful ass and lovely legs and all . Well , not just now anyway . Her good humor sustained the flagging morale of the sand-beaten , wind-stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more behind schedule . O'Neill ordered first half and then quarter rations of food and water . They would never make it if they continued to march during the daylight hours when the sun scorched them and increased their thirst . O'Neill decided the troops should rest during the day and march at night , a decision that slowed the march still more . Some nights there were no moons to show them their way through the thick sand and rolling dunes . ( But they were less visible to possible pursuers . Once , from the vantage point of a high dune , O'Neill thought he saw dust in the distance . A sandstorm ? Narth 's cavalry ? ) Another torture was the sandstorms that struck without warning , forcing them to seek shelter in the lee of the dunes until they were over . Fortunately , they occurred during the day and seldom delayed a march . Seamus wondered how many of the carbines still worked . On the seventh day , Marjetta and Seamus huddled together at the side of a great dune , hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sting of wind-whipped sand . " Tonight should be the last of it , " he shouted over the wind . Marjetta moved her hooded head so that their two cowls formed a tunnel . " It will if your calculations are right . Otherwise we 'll be wondering where our next drink of water will come from . " She was laughing at him . Maybe even with him . Her trust in his expertise was total . He decided not to remind her that they had already marched beyond his calculations . Arrival time tomorrow was at the extreme of calculation , just before panic took over . He spread his robe over both of them so they could talk more easily . " Should I carry Retha in ? I 'm afraid the kid 's feet are so bad she may not make it on her own . " " You told her back at the first camp that she was a bad soldier . She is determined to prove you wrong . She is one of those poor , foolish women , Seamus O'Neill , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' t is a good thing you 're not that way . Sure it might go to my head . " Impulsively he put his arms around her . She did not try to fend him off . Seamus kissed the sand-caked , weary face ineptly at first , then hungrily as his own weary mind let go in the face of urgent and long-suppressed emotion . He felt a surge of response in her , her breasts pressed against his chest . A flame leapt from his heart to hers and back again . With the flame came a strange dread . She turned her head quickly away . " O'Neill , you are incorrigible . Kissing in a sandstorm . " Her voice was severe but shaky . " I am not , after all , a stonyhearted bitch , am I ? " " Well , there 's a time and a place for everything , like my grandmother used to say . As for the stony-hearted bitch , the adjective is yours . I 'll reserve judgment on the rest . " ( Seamus never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . ) He kissed her again . Gently she pushed him away . " You 're a good man , Seamus O'Neill , even better than you know yourself . Not many good men try to appear outrageous like you do . You are kind , gentle , and loyal ; you would not hurt the smallest insect except in selfdefense . I may never see you again after this mission is over , so I will say that I am glad my life had you in it for a time . " Touching his lips with an affectionate finger , she slipped out from under his robe and ran back to the main body of troops . Now does that mean I can have her if I want her ? He was fearful that it might . He spent a dazed few hours when the march resumed at nightfall contemplating the afternoon 's major event . You heard her , I hope , Deirdre . I told you all along that you folks never really appreciated all my sterling qualities . Ah , but it 's a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heaven only knows what that young woman will do for an encore . And thus , O'Neill walked through a long night , the last hours with the weight of the sleeping Retha in his arms . She had finally collapsed , her feet bleeding , her waiflike body dropping with exhaustion . He picked her up . She seemed like a baby in his massive arms , a baby however with very pretty little breasts . Yens , or whatever the hell the little idiot is called , has got himself a good woman . " I can walk , " she protested weakly . " You 'll follow orders if you know what is good for you , " he said gruffly . " Besides I want to walk into the fort tomorrow with a beautiful woman in my arms , and herself is a little heavy if you take my meaning . " The young officer giggled happily and snuggled into his arms . Shortly after dawn Major Seamus O'Neill led his battered , hungry , and thirsty expedition through the open gate of Fort t lyperion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inside the walls . He put the waiflike child with the bleeding feet on the ground , tenderly wrapping a cloak around her , and kissed her soundly . " You 're a good soldier and a superb woman , " he whispered into her ear . She smiled at him through tears of selfsatisfaction . It 's all your fault , Your Eminence , ma'am , if 1 fall in love with every woman on this planet .  | O'Neill pounded his fist with rage on the map table . " Damn ! " The maps fell on the floor . Wearily he picked them up and rearranged them . Spread out before him was the map of Zylong with detailed drawings of the fort and its location . Hyperion was the perfect place to stay until the Iona crowd either landed themselves or gave him the signal to return . The food was good , quarters were comfortable , the garrison friendly ; he saw Marjetta every day . What could be better ? The fort was at the end of a spit that jutted into the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside was covered with a green , grasslike growth immune to the action of salt water and air . On one ocean side , large greenhouses enclosed flowering plants and acres of jarndt . A desalinating plant kept the fort and its produce well supplied with water . Hyperion could get along without the rest of Zylong very well . Beyond the fort , on the opposite side , were the metal mines that Hyperion was supposed to protect , staffed , O'Neill was told , mostly by some hordi . " Slave labor , " he had muttered . " Who is n't in this sick world , " his woman , standing very close to him now , replied . " ' T is a powerful place you have here , " O'Neill had commented to the fort 's Commander after his tour of the settlement . " We may have to survive for a time on our own . " Quars , the genial Commander , a handsome man in his middle forties with a big chest and a trim waist , waved his hands in a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | experience must have perceived , the City is on the edge of anarchy . " " Indeed , " Seamus murmured . Quars was a lot like Carmody , playing the bluff-soldier role , but shrewd and well educated . " Whoever wins up there , and I hope it is someone more competent than the superannuated ninnies who are now in charge , will need this post . Our minerals are essential . They will , if it comes to it , have to deal with us on our terms . " " So that 's why a man of your experience and intelligence accepted assignment here at this distant command ? " If it came to flattery , Seamus was as good as the best of them . " With relief . I did all I could to get it . " He filled Seamus 's la-ir goblet . " I had no desire to follow in Narth 's footsteps . " " They would have thrown you out ? " Seamus sipped the drink contentedly . A proper woman and a proper bottle , what more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all practical purposes , the TPS Iona no longer existed . " I was n't going to take the chance . " The man 's deep laughter boomed as he drained his goblet and refilled it . " Besides , I do n't want to be an emperor . It would be a very short life . " " You may have to contend with him anyway . " Seamus drained his goblet too . No heathen would drink him under the table . " Only if he could capture this post , which he could never do . " Quars waved his hands proudly . " No one could capture it . " And when would you be after expecting this revolution ? " Seamus was becoming a wee bit dizzy , but he was in better control than the Commander . " The next Festival might be the time . " He sighed negligently . " The frenzy is worse each year . Fortunately we are unaffected by it down here . Even if we did n't have ... " Quars 's voice trailed off . Drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important ones , the ones that Seamus most needed to know it Irons was ever to rediscover  | him , that Quars was not going to spill to the friendly alien visitor . " What causes the frenzy ? " Seamus tried to make the question sound casual . Quars refilled Seamus 's goblet with the lovely pink liquid , so much like ice cream with a kick to it . Seamus thought he could see a woman 's image in it . Margie , of course . Lovely woman , even if a bit too pushy . Ah , no , it could n't be the Lady Cardinal ? Sure what would she be doing , lurking in a man 's drink ? " I think it 's obvious , just what a man of your sophistication would expect it to be , a massive and dangerous allergic reaction . The fools developed a new strain of jarndt some years ago . It was supposed to produce much greater harvests on the same acreage of land . As if we did n't have enough of the stuff already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one noticed that they became much wilder . Then we made ourselves so heavily dependent on the new strain of crop that there was fear of changing back . My theory is that with each succeeding year the population becomes more sensitive to whatever gets into the air at harvest time . " " An interesting theory . " " It 's more than theory , man . We do n't have the new strain of jarndt here and we do n't have the frenzy either . Is that not the next thing to a controlled experiment ? " " Ah , ' t is . And you do n't celebrate the Festival down here the way they do up in the City ? " The Commander swayed . " You mean the orgy ? I put an end to that as soon as I came . Nonsense . The women hated it . Not while I 'm Commander . One of the reasons they need us up there , " he chuckled complacently , " is that we supply them with the antidote . " " Do you now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just in case the need arises , interesting chemical compound , the molecules of our little pills blend ... but I wo n't bore you with it .... " And the poor man passed out .  | Seamus stood up uncertainly . Ah , ' t was a grand evening altogether . " You two are worse than two adolescent boys , " Quars 's lovely wife appeared on schedule . " Drinking and bragging and trying to impress one another . " She arranged her husband 's body on the couch , more amused than angry at their antics . Sure if she were mine , I would n't want anyone else pawing her . Not at all , at all . If I had a proper woman ... musha , I do have a proper woman ; the only trouble is that just now I ca n't remember her name . And I think she 's trying to give herself to me and I 'm not sure I want her just yet . " Sure himself is a grand man , " Seamus eased toward the door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . Was n't I after drinking him under the table ? " " That 's no great accomplishment . I can do it too . " She smiled complacently . " Now you 'd better get back to your Marjetta , before you 're as unconscious as he is . " THAT is the woman 's name . " I do n't sleep with the woman ; mind you , she 's a delicious morsel , but there 's no reason to rush into anything . " " Yes . " She sat on the couch and took her husband 's head in her lap . " They say you do n't sleep with her . You outworlders are a strange lot . We are supposed to practice celibacy and avoid it as much as we can . You do n't have to be celibate , I gather , and yet you practice it . How do you explain that ? " There had to be something wrong with her logic , but Seamus 's brain was not functioning all that well . Besides , marriage with a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . " Ah , we 're all a little bit strange when it comes to sex , are n't we now ? " The woman considered him carefully . " I suppose so ... . There , there my dear ? " she patted her husband 's skull " ? you 'll he all right in the morning . Well , in the afternoon . "  | Seamus beat a dignified retreat . To his own bed in the guest officer 's room . Not to Margie 's . So , all in all , it 's a good life . A lovely woman on the beach in the day  --  with all her clothes on , mind you , none of this heathen nude swimming  --  and good drink at night . What more could a man want ? There were problems , of course , but they were his fault , not the fort 's . Margie was the most serious of them . From contempt for O'Neill she had turned to worship . Now that would have been fine , he supposed , but like a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that worship gave her the right to be amused at him . So now the woman laughed at him whenever they were together , even when he was not trying to be funny , which was most of the time . " Yes , Geemie , I want to live now . " Noisy laughter . " Yes , I 've changed my mind . Is that not permitted ? " Great hilarity . " Are you responsible ? " More raucous sounds . " Well , who else would be ? " You kiss a woman a few times in the middle of the desert and she thinks she 's as good as married you . She was still certainly the proper woman for my life , but there was no reason for rushing , now was there ? Scared of the woman ? Me , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill ? Yes , YOU . Well , she is quite a handful , is n't she ? See what I mean ! Furthermore , as though that delicious handful of woman was not enough to have on his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desert had made them " his , " not quite like his platoon of Wild Geese perhaps , but still a brave band of young warriors for whom he was personally responsible . Yet they were up to something , and that pretty little child Retha was up to her lovely neck in scheming . They had n't told him about their plots , which was bad enough , and they were probably going to inform him soon , which was worse .  | Still , both Margie and the troops were tolerable problems , even enjoyable if you wanted to push the point . At least he had people about whom to be concerned again , people that unaccountably seemed even to love him , one way or another . Ah , ' t is the way that 's the problem , do n't you see ? The woman wants to get me into bed and the troops want to get me into a revolution . And all I am is a simple poet and an occasional spy . I could tolerate the uncertainty for a while longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen with the most beautiful woman I 've ever met eases the pain of ambiguity . If you take my meaning ... Just as Seamus was beginning to settle in and get his thinking organized , the " Fourth Secretary " appeared with his staff  --  to the ill-concealed chagrin of Quars . The staff were police types , obviously , despite their army uniforms . Quars 's reaction was one of frigid politeness . He wanted no part of the Committee , but he had to deal with them as long as they were the authority at the other end of the continent . O'Neill wondered how he would choose between Narth and the Secretary . The point of the visit , O'Neill was informed by the oily little gombeen man , was that the Committee had assigned him the great honor of " personally escorting the Honored Guest and the brave Captain " ( a promotion , O'Neill noticed ) back to the City after their " terrible ordeal . " Lieutenant Retha ( another promotion ) could lead the rest of the troops back when they were fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , at all . But he knew an ultimatum when he heard one . The Fourth Secretary was the first Zylongi for whom O'Neill felt an intense dislike . The oily , genial man was a type the Tarans knew well  --  a crooked , dishonest politician . " What do you think ? " Margie asked anxiously as they looked out of the huge window of the Commander 's apartment and watched the blue-robed Secretary ride into the  | parade grounds accompanied by his forty heavily armed " staff . " O'Neill said , " I think they may have a hovercraft transport that is a little bit bigger than they 're letting on . Those horses have come no more than a day 's march . " " What do they want ? " " Us , probably . " So he was in the chart room trying to figure a way out . The alternatives were not attractive . Marjetta joined him at the map-littered table . Since the episode of intimacy he shared with her on the desert , he had adopted a playful attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging and kissing her a couple of times a day , and leaving it at that . She did not seriously object , only routinely remonstrated , " Geemie , stop it . " Then more of her laughter . " Am I that funny ? " he demanded . " Yes , you are . " And she laughed even more loudly . On this occasion he swatted her delectable backside . After the " Stop it , Geemie " and some nearly hysterical giggles , she added , " One of our ' friends ' is outside . " " Ca n't we go anywhere without them ? Your Fourth Secretary is not my idea of a nice man , " O'Neill said . " It is said that he is the one who really runs the Committee . " Marjetta shuddered . " I can not stand the way he looks at me . " Seamus had n't noticed that . Look at my woman , will you ? Well , we 'll see about that . " Let 's not give him time to look . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled out a detailed map of the southern half of the continent . " Let me ask you something first . Are you sure you want to escape from these guys ? It means you 'll be outlawed . If they allow you to get back to the City , there might be a way for the condemnation to be neutralized by your friends in high places . But your chances of ever getting back to the City in the company of the Fourth Secretary and his henchmen are pretty remote . My way carries a lot of risk , probably more danger , and a slow death if it does n't work . "  | " If it is your idea , Geemie , it will work . " I wish I had that much confidence . If only she did n't think that I was better than I really am . " Look at the south , " O'Neill whispered . " The continent tapers off to a point here at Fort Hyperion . The mountains are still high  --  you can see that snow-capped peak out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low pass that leads into the jungle just beyond the first set of foothills . The River flows north from close to where we are to the edge of the Zylong plateau , where it branches east at the Great Waterfall . We know the hordi wo n't cross the River even when it is narrow , as it is at this end . The jungle west of it , along the coast , should be clear of hordi all the way up . " " I see all these things , Geemie , but what are we supposed to do ? " " Sure , we 'll be leaving here at sunset the day after tomorrow with the Fourth Secretary . By midnight we 'll be about here , halfway to where I bet they 've stored their large transport , just opposite the low pass . We 'll take our leave of them and cut out for the mountains and the high jungle . It should n't take more than a day and a half or two days . We 'll have to slog through a bit of hordi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine Narth will have many of his hordi this far south ; we can probably avoid the wild ones . Then we 'll follow the River to the Great Lake , make some kind of raft and float across it up to the waterfall  --  you 'll be one of the few Zylongi to see it . We 'll manage to get down to the low jungle and across it to my spacecraft , then fix the radio so that we can broadcast to the City on enough frequencies so that the whole City knows we 're out there . The Committee will have to bring us back heroes . " " Seamus O'Neill , you are mad , " she said admiringly , her brown eyes shining . " I 've been told that , woman . The point is , will you do it ? " he demanded . " I will . " She took his hand firmly and squeezed it .  | Standing up , he took her other hand and drew her toward him . As their lips touched , she pulled away . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? " Seamus , do n't . Please . " She meant it . Reluctantly he let her go . " Please , do not look so crestfallen . I did not mean to hurt your feelings . I like you very much  --  who would not ? I will follow you to the end of this planet , but there can be nothing between us . I have made my decision . I must go back to the City and take command of the Young Ones . We have to save our people . I know they are not much , but they are eager to make things different . There are many more good ones , like Ornigon and Samaritha , who want new lives . They must be free . I do not want to lead . I have done my best to avoid it ; now I have no choice . It is not your fight . " " Some people have made it my fight without asking me , " he said hotly . " I 've got nowhere else to go ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time . I 'm staying . " What am I saying these things for ? he asked himself . They 're all lies , except that I got caught up in a conflict I had tried to avoid . Sure the woman 's turned my head altogether . " Do not say that just for me , " she warned him stiffly . " Woman , you 're being an idjit . I 'm not saying it just for you . I 'm after telling you it 's for Sammy and Ernie and Horor and the little girl those so-and-so 's killed , and for Pojoon and Retha . " There was a long pause . " Are you sure ? " she said softly . " You 'd try the patience of a saint , woman . Yes , I 'm sure . " " I never thought you were a saint , Seamus O'Neill . " She kissed him like no saint had ever been kissed . Her lips tasted much better than they had in the desert , her hair smelled like the jungle flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . He dug his fingers into the strong muscles of her buttocks . Now night be the time to make her his own . Sure what was the point in waiting any longer ? All right , the 7170n-an uuas a hanil- ful , but so what ? Her breasts fit nicely into his hands too . She was much too strong , but Tarans liked strong women , did n't they ? No , there was no point in waiting at all . And it was cool and quiet here in the chart room . To hell with the spy outside . I want her . He began to ease her toward a chair in the corner . The beach might be better , but the beach was far away and now was the time . Drawing away , she whispered , " Will you help me steal the tranquillity pills ? "  | " Huh ? " said Seamus , his romantic illusions shattered . While he was thinking grand and passionate thoughts , the woman was planning a theft . He released her and watched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vault . They make them down here , you know . Quars is a scientist as well as a soldier . That 's why they did n't feed him into one of the vats . He 's too valuable . We will take only enough for one Festival day . We ca n't leave them without any . Horor and Yens pleaded with me to do it . I refused , but now I must . Retha has convinced me . She says that if you saved our lives it must be for a purpose . " The words tumbled out recklessly , her passion turned from him to her newfound cause . Retha , huh ? That thin-shouldered little scamp is nothing but a great terrible troublemaker . " You want to go through all that again ? " said Seamus , now very much back down to earth . He let go of her and sank wearily into a chair by the map table . " The Young Ones have a plan . On the first day of the Festival they will take the tranquillity pills and storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the carbines and explosives they will take over the Energy Center and the Central Building . They will liquidate the Committee and take command of the City . When the Festival is over , they will be running Zylong . " Her brown eyes were glowing with excitement . " The Guardians , the Committee , the people at key forts like Hyperion , and the Energy Technicians use the pills to stay rational during the Festival . With pills , we can take over the City . "  | Seamus put his hands to his forehead and stared glumly at the maps . " Woman , you 're pretty damn intelligent . What chance do you think such a harebrained idea has ? Do you think two kids like Yens and Horor and a poor little tyke like Retha can overthrow an old and very established society ? " " They have about as much chance as we have of making it through to your spacecraft , the Dove , or whatever you call it , " she flared back at him . " Dev . " Absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Someday you must tell me who he was . " " He was too cute a man to get into something like this . " Then he remembered some of the things De Valera had done and was n't so sure . Maybe this upcoming Festival day will be Zylong 's Easter Monday . The woman has never loved you at all . She 's scheming and conniving and pretending to love you . He noted with considerable satisfaction that his heart was welling with self-pity . What 's the point in living anyway , if your proper woman is only trying to seduce you into a revolution ? " All right , woman , I 'll do it . When and how ? " It would be a great story to tell their grandchildren . " Late night . I 'll come to get you when all is clear . It should be easy . " She was beaming with happiness . Another damn true believer ! Then she laughed at him again and hugged him fiercely . So maybe she 's not lost interest in you altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure sign that they still adore you , if only a little bit . Although Marietta looked as if she might kiss him again , Seamus O'Neill was no longer in any mood for romance . Nor was his romantic mood revived when she shook him awake in the wee hours of the morning , even though he felt the warmth and inhaled the delicious odor of her skin . She had shed her robe for the night 's enterprise . " It will only get in the way . Besides it 's dark . You ca n't see me . " " Worse luck for me . " He sighed loudly . His imagination did a quick flip at the thought of her lentat-covered body . The old dread she stirred iii him returned quickly and cooled  | his fantasies . Still , who knows what we 'll both feel like when we get this stuff out of here ? Taking his hand in her own , Marjetta led O'Neill down a jet-black , bitter-cold corridor . They conserve energy here at Hyperion , O'Neill thought as he groped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand is warm enough , though . Ah , what would be wrong with that warmth next to you in bed every night ? I 'll tell you what would be wrong ; you 'd have to put up with that tongue and willpower during the day . I could do a lot worse . Given time you probably will . I 'm fated . He abandoned the argument with himself because he did n't like its conclusion . Margie seemed to know where she was going . They stopped suddenly . She pushed against a door that swung open slowly . " The guard is asleep . I . . . uh ... his drink tonight was a bit strong . No one has ever tried to steal the pills before ? they do n't officially exist , " Marjetta breathed into O'Neill 's ear . " Shall we kick him to test it ? " he asked ironically . " Sssh . " She pulled open a trapdoor , revealing a dark hole . " There is a ladder there . You go first . Be careful , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being careful . The ladder was metal and it was cold on his bare feet . The hole into which they were climbing was frigid and smelled strongly of seawater . An old tidal cave perhaps . Here I am , he thought , a latter-day Finn MacCool , or was it Art MacConn or Con MacArt ? I can never keep those shitheads from the old mythology straight . I 'm searching for the Holy Grail on the planet Zylong . The magic cup is a box of pills , my magic princess is a half-daft conspirator , and I 'm cold and miserable and lonely and the place smells and the woman does n't love inc and I 've been abandoned by m/ friends and I might as well be dead .  | You go first , she says . So I can be the first one to drown in that seawater I hear roaring down there . Lancelot du Lac , indeed . Galahad , for sure . Parsifal , of course . Maybe they did n't have to do much to program me into a no-account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a long way down . When he finally touched the slimy hard rock floor , he was shivering in the cold air . " I am glad I could not see any of that coming down , " said Marjetta nervously . " I do not like heights . " " You 'll catch your death of cold in that thin thing , " he warned her . " Not when I have you to keep me warm . " She started to giggle . " None of that laughing-at-me stuff now , " he said irritably . " I 'm Lancelot du Lac in quest of the Holy Grail . " Her giggles turned into sniggers , then into laughter . " What are you laughing at , woman ? " he demanded . " You do n't even know the myth . " " I think Lancelot is a very funny name . " " Ah , there 's that . Anyway , let 's find this Holy Grail of yours . Turn on your frigging light . " " What 's frigging ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She turned on the tiny hand light that was strapped to her wrist . The beam searched what appeared to be a small room , coming to rest on a cabinet against one wall . We 'll have a devil of a time getting it open . Marjetta pulled the drawers open one by one until she found what she was looking for , a tiny wooden box . It was filled with white pills . Holy Grail as anticlimax . No dragons to slay  --  when he was a kid , he 'd always wanted to be a modern St. George and slay a dragon  --  no evil queens to fight off , no curses to escape , no sword battles with black knights . You simply climb down a long hole with your shivering magic princess and you find it in an open box . Easiest thing in the world .  | Then the poet in O'Neill began to think about the symbolism of climbing down a long hole into a dark , sea-scoured cave . Now is n't that interesting . What dirty minds those mythmakers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down anything more tonight . You 're never certain whether you can get out of these cave things . " A hundred of them  --  enough to free Zylong ! " She was shaking with excitement . " Hold me tight , Geemie . When I think what this can do for my world . . . I am frightened . " He held her close to him , his hand fitting naturally into the concavity of her back . The pressure of her soft body against his chest was enough to make him almost lose his reason . He felt a sharp stab of delicious pain in his chest , as though something were breaking . He wanted this woman ; he was afraid of her ; indeed , terrified of her . But he still wanted her . She was the proper woman if there were ever to be one . Well , maybe you should climb down into some caves . His knees were shaking . Tonight is the night to get her into my proper bed and begin my descent into the underworld . Ah , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to explore her body with his lips . That 's what the Grail legend is about , is n't it ? Finn gets the magic cup and the magic princess ? Two sacred vessels ? " Let 's get out of here before we decide to stay , " he muttered into her hair . This business of searching for the Holy Grail might have its good points after all . O'Neill was back in his own room before he realized how easy it had been . He was in it now up to his neck . Stealing the pills was a kind of engagement with this society which the battles on the desert were not . Tricked into it by two women , one of them a wee slip of a revolutionary and the other someone who pretended to love him . Of course , he did n't bring Marietta back to his bed . She would have come . She was so happy and grateful that she  | would have done anything he wanted . Seamus Finnbar O'Neill wanted no woman on those terms . " Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very warm after that terrible cave . " " Swim at night ? " he exclaimed in horror . " " The moons will be out , " she was laughing at him again . " I think I 'll pass it up tonight , " he sighed . " We have a long trip ahead of us . " She kissed him at his door . " Brigid and Brendan and Mary be with you , my beloved . " First time she had ever called him that . " You 're picking up all the names , " he admitted grudgingly . " I do n't quite understand how Mary and Brigid are different . " " My ancestors had a hard time with that too . Well , off with you , woman . You need your sleep too . " Seamus Finnbar O'Neill , the last great playboy of the western world  --  indeed , the whole western quadrant of the frigging galaxy  --  fell into an uneasy sleep in which he was pursued by dragons and demons who lurked in deep , cold caves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . Why did he feel frightened and guilty ? Then he remembered what had happened . Dear God , I broke all the Rules . The Taran Code says you do not interfere in the politics of an alien world . That 's exactly what I did . Without even thinking about it . Seduced by a terrible woman . Now I 'm in the big muddy altogether . The farewell scene when they left Retha and their desert companions was a bad one . The little Lieutenant was tonguetied with emotion and worried about her own task of bringing the troops back to the City . " Rea , me girl , " Seamus O'Neill tried to hearten her , " in one week I 'll be buying you and your young man the biggest refreshment in the whole of /long . Now take care of your  | feet this time . I 'd hate to have to come out and carry you in again . " She began to laugh . O'Neill bent down over her and tenderly kissed the small forehead . " Sure it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered . He hated to leave them . They were a good troop after all  --  not like a company of Wild Geese , but given time and a good commander ... " Do you Tarans kiss every woman you meet ? " asked Marjetta coldly , as they rode off into the dusk with the column of " staff . " " Only the beautiful ones , my dear . " " You think Lieutenant Retha is a beautiful woman ? " Her control was slipping . " Ah , well , we kiss them all back on Tara , " he said teasingly . " Why , one day I even kissed the cheek of the Lady Deirdre .... " " Who ? " Her voice was edgy . O'Neill froze in his saddle . How did that slip out ? How am I to explain Deirdre ? " Ah , nobody important , " he managed . " Well , she 's kind of important  --  a religious leader of a sort , " he amended . " Is she beautiful ? " Marjetta was stony-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . She 's an old woman now . I guess she never was anything much to look at . "  | The midday meal which Quars had presided over before they left was pretty much like that last dinner at Ernie 's living space before the journey through the desert , somewhat less cheery than a Gaelic wake . The Colonel obviously never expected to see them again . Retha , her eyes intermittently filled with tears , hardly touched her food . Marjetta was charming but tense . The ugly , oily , heavy-browed Fourth Secretary radiated charming geniality , like an undertaker at a wake . " It will be , " he insisted , " a quick and pleasant trip . Nothing like the last one . " Babbling about music and poetry on Zylong , O'Neill matched him cliche for cliche . It was the kind of battle of wits Seamus O'Neill loved , especially since he was convinced he was smarter than the Fourth Secretary by several lightyears . The contest would continue out in the desert , too , and Seamus knew he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a commandant in the Wild Geese . At all , at all . The nice thing about a battle of wits between a gombeen man and an officer in the Wild Geese was that there was nothing about love or women involved . It was merely a game , a deadly serious game admittedly , in which two men tried to deceive each other . Unfortunately there might be a woman as a prize : the Fourth Secretary did not bother to hide his lascivious examination of Marjetta . He wanted her and proposed to have her before the sun rose again . Well , c'e 'll just see about that , my good man . She 's mine , you  | see . And while I have no idea just now what to do about her , I 'll not be after letting you have her . So they were fighting over a woman , among other things , but the woman was only an object of the battle and not a person whose erratic moods , alternating between laughter and fury , both equally unexplained , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desert , she 'd follow orders . She 's a good soldier , if nothing else . Go ' long with you , Seamus O'Neill . She 's more than that . Do n't bother me with such considerations . I must worry about the game with this gombeen man here . The Fourth Secretary announced that it would be appropriate for everyone to retire to their rooms for some sleep before their departure after sunset . Marjetta stopped O'Neill on the way to his room . " How will we escape ? Have you figured it out yet ? " she asked , her voice strained by tension . " Do n't be so impatient , woman . We have seven or eight hours yet . I 'll tell you what I 'm thinking . We 'll probably be safe until we get to the large transport . They wo n't try anything while we 're riding and carrying our own guns . Also they wo n't try anything until we 're beyond the range of Quars 's monitoring system . So we should make our move sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel 's maps ; we 'll be able to find our way with it . This clown thinks he 's got us fooled . It 's Quars he 's worried about . If we seem dumb and innocent , they 'll lower their guard . When I whistle like this ? " he hummed the first few bars of the " Whistling Gypsy " " ? you turn to the right and gallop like hell . I 'll give them something to remember us by and follow after you . " She nodded . He did n't bother to tell her he had also filched powder grenades from Quars 's arsenal . O'Neill moved again toward his room , then stopped and looked at Marjetta . " You 're sure that they 'll not harm Retha and the rest of my ... our troops . " " Of course not . She 's now known to he as heroine . It all  | of us died , the Committee would not be able to prevent discussion . And if I disappear , perhaps into Narth 's harem when the Secretary is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the Young Ones a threat . " " We 'll see about a few wee changes in that scenario . So they really are that impressed with you ? " " I 'm sure that seems inconceivable to you , Major O'Neill , but yes , the Committee seems to think I am brilliant and dangerous . And myself a woman too . " She was even imitating his idiom . " Women are all right in their place . " Dear Brigid , would he be in trouble for even thinking that on the Iona . " Well , you need n't worry about your little friend Retha . She 'll be in her man 's arms in a few days . " " Ah , sure you would n't be telling me that they 're lovers . She 's a mere child . " " You should see him . " She smiled faintly . " He appears to be about fourteen of our years . I am certain she was the aggressor . They are , ah , quite passionate about each other . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now , the rules have been discarded by many . They do not even receive nominal obedience out here . " " West of the Pecos . " " What does that mean ? " " A mythological reference . Why do they break the rules that young ? " " It is simple . " She shrugged and made a distasteful face ? at him , he supposed . " They are young . They love each other . They expect to die . Is that not enough reason to be in the same bed ? " " Well , I suppose so . I never thought it would happen here . " " Tarans are bigots , " she snapped and turned to leave him . Right enough , nnv dear . We know all there is to know about cultural diversity/ . Our Rules demand that we be tolerant of it and  | not meddle in other cultures , like I 've been doing since you talked me into it . But still , there are only a few of us on a small planet and fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tight and convinced that our ways are the best . Which they are . And we look down on everyone else as poor benighted heathens . Which they are . But you 're a heathen , my darling , and I love you . I 'm not going to let that greasy goat lay his hands on you , not at all . At all . " Marjetta ... " " Yes ? " She jumped as though she had been shot . " Do n't forget those pills . " He swatted her rump . She turned and faced him . " Will I like her ? " " Who ? " " Deirdre . " " Not at all , at all . " He was in so much trouble now , what did a few more lies matter . " Well , maybe after a while . Sure you might become as thick as thieves . " The woman was already assuming that she was going to come with him . He 'd never told her that . Not exactly , anyway . " Will she like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " Dusk had already begun to settle at this end of the continent . Soon they would have to leave . " Well now , I think she 'll delight in you , Margie me girl . You 're the kind of woman that Tarans of both sexes adore . The men will all fall in love with you , like I was after doing , and myself seeing you for the first time , and the young women will all identify with you , and the old women , even the real old women like the Lady Deirdre ? " he mentally made a sign of the cross " ? will want to mother you . " " Thank you very much , Seamus O'Neill , Poet and Soldier . " He glanced to one side and saw her warmly smiling at him . " That was very nice . You are very nice too . Some of the time . " " A man tries . " He turned away , stunned by the loveliness of her smile .  | No , that greasy gombeen man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the galaxy of you . Not if I can help it . Later that night , Hyperion long since lost in the darkness and its scanners probably out of range , O'Neill gripped the reins of his horse tightly . For the tenth time that night , he cursed the Zylong moons . They had risen early . He had not figured their rotation cycle properly . Now every grain of sand on the wide beach seemed visible as the silent column trotted across it . The high mountains toward which they rode stood out clearly in the moonlight , their snow-covered peaks gleaming . Chances for a successful escape in this light were poor . You were so besotted with the woman that you were n't thinking clearly . You 're still not . His throat tightened . He 'd never played the game for such a prize before . It changed everything . O'Neill 's danger sense was much higher than it ought to have been this early in the ride . Maybe the Fourth Secretary 's boys were n't planning to wait until they arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seamus had thought . " Never , I repeat , never , allow yourself the luxury of underestimating the enemy " : Carmody 's first rule . And he 'd broken it . Along with a lot of other rules . So get ready for battle , he warned himself . Shape up , O'Neill . But the problem was not so much battle as trickery . He was alert , ready , physically and mentally eager for battle . He sniffed the cold desert air , a soldier now , not a spy . But he was n't able to activate the crafty part of his mind . Away from other Tarans too long . Well , if you want me back , he informed herself , in the unlikely event she was listening , you 'd better come up with something good really quick . Like ten minutes ago . Despite the silence of the marchers , he tried to keep the Fourth Secretary in conversa:ion . " Tell me more about this  | fellow Narth who everyone at the fort was talking about . Where is his ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid , Poet O'Neill , that you have been taking our folk stories literally . A long time ago a member of the Committee , a brilliant man  --  perhaps the most brilliant we ever had  --  became mentally disturbed from overwork . He asked permission to go out of the City and live in the countryside until he regained his health . Poor man , what could the Committee do ? Obviously he would not survive in the outer reaches of our planet . He would hear no argument , so we let him go . No one has seen him since ; it is presumed that he died long ago . Most Zylongi have a very superstitious fear of the countryside ; legends grow fast in such circumstances . Occasional attacks from hordi bands on caravans like yours do n't help . " It sounded like an official party line . O'Neill persisted . " I also heard tales of ' the Hooded Ones ' and ' the Young Ones . ' Who are they ? More legends ? " The Secretary dismissed them with a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regret that the garrison at Hyperion has filled the mind of an important guest of Zylong with such nonsense . Even in as well-organized and efficient a society as ours , there are occasional accidents  --  a construction collapse , a crash of small vehicles , a fight between people who have had too much of the wrong kind of la-ir , a less than satisfactory harvest .... " " A monorail accident ? " He watched out of the corner of his eye for a reaction . The Fourth Secretary 's thick lips tightened . His answer was a fraction of a second too late . " Yes , those do happen , too , though very rarely . The computer program ... In any case , it suits the superstitious needs of some of our less educated people to create explanations for these chance events . So they imagine completely fictional bands of terrorists . Every older generation is dismayed by their young and their ' radical ' ideas . Our young people are exemplary citizens  --  like our good and brave ( ' ap  | taro Marjetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her promotion by her brave actions at a time of great personal loss . " " Thank you , Honored Secretary , " Marjetta said , politely staring straight ahead into the desert . " My dear . " He nodded at her , then continued . " The Guardians eliminated supernatural demons from our culture at the time of the Reorganization . There are some residual needs that are served by these natural if fictional demons . While we are dismayed by their persistence and confidently expect that we will eliminate them by proper genetic controls in the future , the fact remains that they do persist . They are socially of no importance . " " I suppose that the stories about the Festivals are also largely fictional ? " He was pressing his luck a bit . The Secretary might get suspicious . But this time he did n't hesitate a moment . " My dear man , surely a widely traveled person like yourself is familiar with the carnival week syndrome that exists in almost every society ? You know how people love to exaggerate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you could remain with us , you would find that our carnival time is a time of quite innocent relaxation , despite the wildly exaggerated tales which have grown up around it . It is a very mild period of rest and refreshment after the hard work of harvesting . Our Guardians quite rightly insisted that all honored citizens of our democratic society would participate in the harvest work . I hope you will discount any exaggerations you have heard about the Festivals . Ours is a small and very provincial planet . Stories have a way of getting beyond all proper bounds . They do no great harm , but they certainly would disturb a visitor with less sophistication than yourself . " The so-and-so is plausible enough , O'Neill thought . If I did n't know better , I might well have swallowed the whole line . The attack at the first campsite and the sight of Narth , Imperial Guard surrounding him , were not imaginary , and  | neither were those killers in the monorail station . The prickling at the back of his neck that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly enough , the danger seemed to come from outside the marching column . Something was drawing closer every minute . What 's going on in Margie 's pretty head ? She has not looked your way once during the ride . But surely she trusts in you . Completely . Has to , poor woman . Is she scared ? Of course she is . So are you , Seamus O'Neill , admit it . Well , there 's a lot to be scared about . Once he had thought her solid rock . Now he knew there was fire under the rock , disconcerting animal passion and patriotic fervor . And beneath the fire , he was beginning to discover gentleness and fragility . And wit , too , even if she laughed at him . When she was in his arms , he lusted for her . At other times he feared her but could n't quite understand why . Would she be reliable in combat , now that some of the fire had erupted ? The back of his neck warned him not to be too certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not going to get his greasy paws on her . They rode on for several more hours . The danger feeling did not abate . But it seemed farther away , as though it were n't in the Fourth Secretary 's troop at all , but somewhere else . They were approaching the mountains . He had misjudged where the Zylongi parked the transport , so that they were much farther away from the pass that would lead them out of the desert . Fortunately , two moons had set ; the desert was darker . At the leader 's guttural command the column wheeled left and began to descend a sloping ravine in the rocky , uneven desert floor . O'Neill 's sense of danger shot up . They 're going to do something now . I do n't know what it is , but now 's the time . We are going to redeploy instantly . Which means run like hell . As they entered the ravine he began the " Whistling Gypsy " tune an instant before shoving the Fourth Secretary from his horse . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galloped up the slope . He did n't see or hear Marjetta . It was a trap  --  not for O'Neill and Marjetta , but for their Zylongi escorts . Out of rifle range , O'Neill stopped to look for Margie . She was there , bless her , right behind him . " What is going on ? " she exclaimed breathlessly . " Just as you rode away the head of the column came under fire . The ravine was filled with Narth 's cavalry . O'Neill , how did you know ? " " I did n't . I just knew there was something wrong with that ravine . It 's a little trick we Tarans have . I 'll tell you about it someday . " The two rested their horses while they surveyed the scene spread out below them . Their breakaway had saved the column from complete and immediate destruction . Narth 's pony soldiers had started shooting as soon as they saw the commotion caused by O'Neill 's and Marjetta 's escape . This gave the rear of the column time to dig in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narth 's cavalry were caught inside , and despite the sharpshooters stationed along the rim , it looked like there would be quite a long battle . " Our friends on both sides will be busy . Let 's put as much distance between them and us as we can before they decide they have one aim in common and we 're it . " He spurred his horse forward and they raced across the sands toward the towering mountains gleaming in the ghostly moonlight . An hour and a half of hard riding later , they came up against a sheer cliff face . " Is not the pass that way ? " asked Margie , pointing worth . " It is , but I 'm trying to figure out what to do . Narth is that way too . We might try to head back to the fort . But I think the Committee will want us even more after tonight ; it might not be all that safe there . " " Poor Retha . She will lead her troop through that . " She pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do about Retha , " O'Neill said , shrugging his shoulders . " ( guars is a good soldier . He will  | know what 's happened out here . He may take matters into his own hands and lead an expeditionary force . " They picked their way slowly along the edge of the mountain wall . The horses were tired now . There seemed little danger of pursuit but much danger of stumbling into someone they did not want to meet . Suddenly the night air was rent by a tremendous explosion . A ball of light shot up from the desert floor , sending a giant mushroom cloud into the darkened sky . So they have those kinds of things here too , Seamus thought , remembering the worn-out video tapes on the Iona . Nuclear weapons . And they 're not afraid to use them . O'Neill and Marjetta struggled to calm their frightened mounts . " What was that ? " Marjetta exclaimed , terror choking her words . " What do you want to bet that it was some sort of selfdestruct charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on it too . It would be a nice toy for him to have . The Committee probably had it rigged so that it could be destroyed on command of the Central Building . This has not been a good night for the Fourth Secretary and his staff . I do n't think you 'll have to worry about him again . " She shivered with disgust but bravely replied , " With you protecting me , I did not fear him . " " I may not deserve that praise , woman . " He sighed loudly . " But from yourself , ' t is good to hear it . " " It 's only the truth . " Well , she 's not laughing at me now . I 'd better change the subject . " Do you think he was really the boss behind the Committee ? " " That gives him too much credit , Geemie . " She patted her horse reassuringly . " He was the one who accomplished things , the only one who was not an ineffectual old man . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'll be a vacuum  --  into which you and your friends can rush ? "  | " That seems a long way from here , does n't it ? And highly improbable ? " " I do n't know . I 'm only a wandering poet . Come to think of it , however , it 's not been an especially good night for Narth . He must have lost his best troops in that explosion . Come on , let 's see if we can find this pass . " They found it at first light . It did n't look low . The natural trail wound up through the mountains steeply , losing itself in mists and snow near the top . " Are you game ? " Seamus looked over at Marjetta . She was tired already , too early for a dependable officer . " I have always wondered what the mountains were like . I have never felt snow . " She grinned at him , her brown eyes sparkling like a sky of stars . He lost a heartbeat or two in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was arduous at first . Sometime after sunrise the path up the mountain widened to a broad avenue of rock , becoming less steep . It was an ascending canyon with tall walls on either side . Seamus was relaxed , so occupied with looking at Marjetta and spinning dreams that his psychic sense completely failed him this time . They rounded a bend and were astonished to see , waiting not twenty yards away , Narth and a half dozen of his guard . They were trapped . " So , " boomed the crimson-clad , black-bearded " Emperor " of Zylong . " The lovely young leader of the foolish radicals and the inestimable Major O'Neill from the Iona . You two have caused me a good deal of trouble . I think you will shortly learn about real revolution instead of cafe-table talking . Dismount from your horses . Do not try to move your weapons . Try nothing foolish . O'Neill , you are a dead man , but the woman might make an interesting mate , with the proper training and experience . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She will perhaps even come to enjoy it . Do n't risk her life with stupid heroics . " " Ah , now , why would I do anything foolish ? " Seamus temporized as he and Margie slowly dismounted . 1 le man- aged to loosen what he wanted to as he got off the horse . " But since you know about the Iona , ca n't we be after making a wee deal , just you and me ? I do n't care about the woman . You can have her if you want . She 's not much in bed anyway . Your beautiful military types tend to be frigid , as I 'm sure yourself knows . " " That 's a very interesting suggestion . " Narth 's thick white teeth flashed in a crooked grin . " Send me the woman and we 'll talk . " " You heard what the man said . " O'Neill shoved her in the direction of the Emperor and his Guard  --  a badly battered little crowd . All that was left from the explosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slipped a few inches closer to the canyon wall , drawing his horse with him . Poor Marjetta stumbled toward Narth . Out of the frying pan into the fire . You 're going to have to be mighty quick , woman , if I 'm going to get away with this . She stood in front of Narth , obedient and abject . He fondled her for a few moments . She did not resist or respond . Seamus stepped a couple of feet closer to the wall . One of the guards raised his weapon a few inches , but no one else seemed to notice . " Like I said , your military women really do n't have much to offer . " " I will enjoying educating her , " Narth slobbered over his captive . " As with so much else in life , it is the process that brings the satisfaction , not the end result . Do n't you agree , O'Neill ? " " Sure , the process with that one will not be any picnic . " He was almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was behind Narth and his troops . " Now about the Iona ... " They should have rushed him and tied him up at the first moment . But it was a surprise encounter , as much a shock to them as to Margie and himself . And they were still battered from the explosion . And for all his tough talk , Narth , like everyone else on /ylong , was a hit in awe of the red- bearded giant from outer space . Who knew what might happen if they got too close to him ? Better to keep him at a distance with their guns aimed at him . " Indeed . " Narth smiled genially . " I doubt that you can deliver the Iona to me , but it might be useful to explore ways of cooperation in any case . Moreover I wish to know more about her . There are ways of finding out , as you may imagine . Need I say that they are in themselves amusing , although neither you nor the lovely Captain would find them such . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " First of all , what is the complement of the ship ? And again , Major O'Neill ? " he must have seen the light of battle in O'Neill 's eyes " ? let me warn you against doing anything foolish . There are easy and there are painful , terribly painful ways to die . " " Ah , sure what is there foolish I can do ? " O'Neill then did something very foolish . Snatching his smoke grenade from its fastening on the saddle , he lobbed it up the canyon wall . Like a ball thrown on a slanted roof , it rolled up the wall , hesitated , and then began to slide down again . Surprised and startled , Narth and his guards turned to watch the round object accelerating toward them . Seamus grabbed his carbine . Marjetta broke away from Narth and began to run toward him . Seamus raised the weapon , ready to fire as soon as she was clear . She jumped behind a rock . Just as he opened fire , the Imperial Guard did something equally foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they shot at it as it lumbered toward them . One of them was a pretty good shot . O'Neill , blazing away now with his own weapon , just had time to shout " Hit the ground ! " before he was assisted off his feet by the detonation . A long , long time later he fought his way back to consciousness . The sun was now high in the sky and shining brightly . The canyon was dead quiet  --  indeed , it was filled with death . Was he the only one alive ? Ahead of him on the canyon  | floor were the remains of the Emperor Narth 's Guard . The imperial robe was now rust-colored with dried blood . Sure enough , the robe itself had n't burned . So these robes were not flammable . Like a man on a binge , Seamus considered his own robe . Nope , it had n't burned either . Now what was I supposed to be thinking about ? Oh yes , there 's no body in Narth 's robe . Now , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a frightened horse ? Sure , if he had , he would n't fall for that trick the next time . So I 'll think up a better trick . Anyhow , if the blast blew him out of his robe , he 's probably dead . There 's something else I should be thinking about . No , someone else . Someone real important . Now let 's see , who is it ? O'Neill checked his own limbs ; everything seemed to be in working order . Well , now he and Marjetta could resume their travels . Marjetta ! Where is she ? He stumbled to his feet . Their horses had disappeared , racing back in terror , no doubt , to the lowlands where they belonged . Near the bodies of Narth 's guards sprawled grotesquely on a rock slide against the canyon wall , Marjetta lay , apparently as lifeless as the rest of them . His ears ringing , his legs unsteady , he stumbled to her and turned her over . She appeared to be sleeping , except there was a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the hairline . Running to the supply pack , which his horse had shed in the rush to escape this place of strange noises , he found a syringe of life serum . With shaking hands he managed to inject it into her arm . At first there was no reaction . He felt for a pulse . Still there , but very weak . If some life serum is good , would more be better ? Sammy had never told him . Her pulse was slowing down . He dashed back and removed the two remaining vials of life serum and injected them clumsily into her arm . Slowly color returned to Margie 's pale face . A few mo- ments later when she opened her eyes he was holding her in his arms . He busied himself fixing the scratch on her head . She clung to him , fighting for self-control ; then grinned again . " Quick thinking , Major , " she said with a wink . " But how do you know what I 'm like in bed ? "  | Margie recovered quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly than he , and started going through their packs , choosing what to carry and what to leave behind . " I 'm younger and better , " she explained . " And was n't I wonderful ? I had Narth convinced that I 'd given up on you and become his abject slave . " " Well , you were pretty good , " he conceded grudgingly , " though I should be saying it instead of yourself . You could have distracted him a wee bit more . " " Then he would n't have believed your slander , " she argued genially , " that I was a frigid virgin who would require sexual initiation , would he ? " " Are n't you ? " " I do n't think I 'm frigid , anyway . " She hefted a pack , finding it not too heavy . She jammed some more food into it . " We 'll have to wait and see , wo n't we ? " Well , that 's clear enough . " Ay , we will indeed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ignored her last comment altogether  --  though he was betting that , like any proper virgin , she might be inexperienced , but hardly frigid . Not by several light-years . " To change the subject to safer matters ? " his hands were still trembling " ? you were very brave and very quick . I counted on you to be both . Otherwise we would be as dead as they are . " She straightened up and turned toward him , a tall slender woman in a long brown cloak that matched her hair and her glowing eyes , a hack on her hack and a weapon in her  | hand . " Thank you , Geemie . I 'm glad you counted on me and I 'm glad you were right in doing so . " You 're getting deeper and deeper into trouble , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill . Both of them wanted to leave the horror of the canyon . Narth might be dead , but his troops could still be around ; a second in command might try to prove his claim to empire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged silently up the mountain , both again preoccupied with their own thoughts . As they approached the snow line , Marjetta spoke . " What is the Iona ? " she snapped at him , the good feeling of a couple of hours ago suddenly broken by suspicion and distrust . " Narth said you were Major O'Neill from the Iona . That is not what you call your spacecraft . " " Did he say that ? " Now the lies had to start again . " That was the name of my command on Tara . Each regiment had its own name . How did he know you were going to take command of the Young Ones when you got back ? " He had to get her back on the defensive . There was a lot of rock still in the girl . " I do not know . I told no one ... no one but you , that is. , , " I certainly would n't have tossed that grenade at Narth if I were on his side , " he said reasonably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sighed . " I do not know what to think . " " Was Narth supposed to have any kind of ... well .. . sort of special powers that were different from what ordinary people could do ? " " Yes . He was said to be able to read people 's minds . How did you know that ? No one ever mentions it on Zylong except in whispers . It is too frightening . " She shivered . " Do you have that power , Geemie ? Can you read my mind ? " Her brown eyes widened with terror . " If I could , I 'd he afraid to try , " he said honestly enough . Then , scratching his head he turned to moderate honesty to  | placate her . " Most of us Tarans have traces of that sort of thing  --  kind of an evolutionary throwback , they tell us . All I 'm really good at is sensing danger . It only works when I concentrate on it  --  like back at the ravine . Later I was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up on this last surprise . " " I am glad you can sense danger and I am also glad you can not read my mind . It would be embarrassing . " Her voice trailed off and her lips tightened . Now what does she mean by that ? As if you do n't know , boyo . She wants you even worse than you want her . And is less afraid of it than you are too . You keep out of this . We have a mountain to climb . His estimates of the height of this " low pass " were completely wrong . He had figured that maybe there would be a thin layer of snow on the ground , but it was ankle-deep at first and then knee-deep . The top layer melted in the daytime , then froze at night , so that the surface of the snow was crusted and slippery but not firm enough to hold their weight . During the day , the temperature was above freezing  --  still cold by desert and Zylong City standards . Their desert robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wore were high and strong enough to protect their feet . Marjetta had never known cold like this . She was having a difficult time negotiating the deep snow . O'Neill was sure they would n't get through the snowbelt that day . It meant a frigid night at the top of the pass with no fire and only body heat to survive . He was troubled by Narth 's knowledge of Iona . How much had he known ? Who told him ? The Zylongi were not completely unsophisticated about psychic mechanisms even thought they did n't use the word . If Narth had known about the monastery , what were the chances that someone else might too ? The questions were soon forgotten in the simple struggle to survive . As the sun slipped slowly toward the horizon , they reached the top of the pass . They saw the dark green  | jungle far below them and the inviting purple of the ocean beyond that . They had made it halfway . Poor Margie was nearly finished . She was exhausted , frightened , and shivering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of pain . " Seamus , it is impossible , " she moaned . " I can not go on . You must leave me here . I will decide to die . It will come quickly . " " No one is deciding anything . Let 's find a cave and figure out a way to keep warm . " He grabbed her arm roughly and dragged her along . He was n't sure he could make it down the other side himself . Better that the two of them freeze to death up here together . With his arm around the faltering Marjetta , he pushed through the snow toward the side of the pass , looking for a cave , a cleft in the rock  --  even an indentation where they would be protected from the wind , which had steadily increased since sunset . They found a tiny cave , little more than a depression in the rock face . The two of them huddled together with their packs , carbines , and spears piled up in front of them for more protection from the howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was free from snow , but it was very cold . Marjetta shivered wretchedly . He drew her close to himself to share his warmth , and gradually her trembling stopped . They would never last the night . She knew it . Tears of despair and pain flowed down her cheeks . " Sure the next time I go mountain climbing I 'll be after choosing a woman who does n't get cold , " he joked , his own teeth chattering , and pulled her still closer . It was now completely dark . There seemed no reason not to light one of the tiny lanterns they carried in their packs . To die in the light seemed easier than to face death in the dark . Light ! That gave him an idea . " Margie , these illumination grenades ... is there any way we can set them to go off  | slowly ? Can we rig it so that they last an hour or so ? There 's enough power in them to keep this cave warm for a while . " " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but even if you push the dial all the way , it will only last fifteen minutes . If you get too close to a grenade , even at that intensity it will burn you to death . " He managed to pry the cover off one grenade and find the mechanism . The timer was a serviceable device that inhibited the flow of acid from the supply compartment to the ignition spark . " What if I tear off a little bit of cloth from my robe and wrap that around the flow valve ? The cloth is supposed to be unburnable , and it should slow the acid flow . " " I do n't know . " She was shaking so hard that he feared she might hurt herself against walls of their tiny shelter . In a few moments , her spasms might break out of control . Well , this thing could explode on us and we 'd have more heat than we wanted . Enough to fry us . On the other hand , I 'm not going to sit here and watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating unit , put it on a ledge outside the cave , and pulled the pin . The light slowly began to shine , heat flowed back into the cave  --  not much , but enough to keep them alive . Margie 's sigh as the warmth hit her face was that of one who had been pulled back from the brink . " See , little one , stick with old Uncle Seamus . He can fix anything . " He hugged her . They ate concentrated supper bars and sipped vitaminenriched water from their canteens . The cave was uncomfortable ; the glare from the light was hard on their eyes until they had the sense to put on the smoked glasses used in desert travel . Then the cave took on a bizarre shade of green that made Margie laugh . The heat from the homemade furnace lasted close to an hour . They had six grenades in all , so if he used them at hour-and-a-half intervals , they could make it all through the night .  | " Young woman , " Seamus briskly announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting this , but I trust you see the sense of sleeping in my arms tonight . " " I can not think of a place where my virtue as a Zylongi maiden would be better assured . " She sighed in contentment and then stiffened . . . . " But you will have to change the grenades . You will not sleep ? " " Who is the commander of this expedition , woman ? " O'Neill demanded . " You are . " Again the crinkly grin and the starry brown eyes , quickly lowered . " What did I say ? " He put his hand under her chin and forced the eyes back into view . " That I needed sleep . " Now her grin was embarrassed , sheepish . " Then do as you are told , " he said gruffly , drawing her close . " Yes , sir . " She leaned obediently against his chest . In ten minutes she was sound asleep , snuggled up against him , giving and receiving body warmth . O'Neill 's head was jumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenges of the next day . But this girl disconcerted him , kept him off balance , attracted him , and scared the hell out of him . Why does she look at me that way ? I can have her anytime I want . She 's offered me her virginity , her self , her life . But it would be a mortal sin to make love to her , would n't it now ? If you start , Seamus O'Neill , you 'll never stop . She 's the proper woman , you 'll never give up . You know that . Where are you going to find a better one , I ask you ? Nowhere . Did n't Carmody tell you that sex was meant to draw people together despite their fears ? I h ' did .  | You do n't intend just to take her and enjoy her and then leave her , do you ? I should clobber you for even suggesting that . And will herself ever stop loving you ? Well , I 'm not good enough for her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you waiting for then ? It would be a great , terrible sin . The Cardinal would never forgive . Making love to a defenseless local . She 's not all that defenseless . Yes , she is . Seamus pondered . The Lady Abbess . He shivered , and not from the cold . Then he remember something she had once said about canon law : If two people wanted to marry and could not find a proper clergyperson for a long period of time , they could exchange commitments and it would be a valid and permanent marriage . Ah , would it now ? Did n't the Cardinal herself say so ? She did . Well , that kills another of your excuses . If she 's your proper woman and there 's no one around to bless the two of you , then she 's your wife and that 's that . Well , I 'll think about it . We have lots of time yet . Coward . There were a lot of other things to think about the next morning . That day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the snow and on the steep downward trail , which gave them a psychological lift . Margie did n't have much reserve strength ; she stumbled occasionally , sometimes reaching out to Seamus to keep from falling . But her spirits were high . " Let me know the next time you select a low pass , " she laughed . That struck them both as terribly funny . Her irony was beginning to sound like his . The Zylongi were an imitative people , their culture made strong demands for social homo- geneity . If she associated with him long enough , she might pick up a good deal of his behavior  --  maybe even some of his temperament . That would not be a good thing at all . Late in the afternoon they stumbled , exhausted and worn , into the warm , gentle foothills where the jungle began . Margie wanted to stop . O'Neill insisted that they try to get across the River while it was still light . They struggled on . Seamus could think of nothing but soft grass and warm water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , when darkness had fallen , they stumbled down the side of the last foothill and into a meadow bordering a tributary of the River with its own little waterfall and pool . Paradise , he thought . We 've made it . They could go no further . Both threw off their desert cloaks and sank into the pool with grateful relief . They should never have made it . After a good soak , Seamus and Marjetta lay together on the grass beside the pool , the moonlight turning Marjetta into an alabaster statue . Her naked body was flawlessly designed , perfection in its rich , supple detail . Yet he still was afraid of her . How could anything that beautiful be dangerous ? Why did she seem a trap ? It was not just the weariness of their journey which blotted out his lust . Margie 's haunting beauty in the moonlight warned him away , a dangerous garden with deadly flowers . No different than the cold , slimy cave at the end of the long passage that frightened you at Hyperion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being alone in a forest with a naked woman ? Now look at you . You 're in paradise with Eve and you do n't want her . " Geemie ? " her sad brown eyes turned plaintively to him " ? are you sure you can not read my mind ? " " Woman , you are the worst unbeliever of them all . No , I ca n't read your mind , worse luck for me , I suppose . Your privacy is safe from my snooping curiosity . " Now he was really having trouble controlling himself , so his tone sounded  | very angry . Fear or not , there were hungers stirring within him . " I wish you could . " Her voice was small and very soft . " You 're like all Taran women , all right , " he laughed gruffly , " always changing your mind . " He debated jumping back into the pool . The woman was certainly trying to seduce him now , and himself worn out from the long day 's trip . Why does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , Seamus O'Neill . I do not have much life left , and I want to belong to you . I have wanted to belong to you , Taran , since I pulled you out of the sewer . I have broken all the other rules of my culture , so it is time to break the last one with you . I am just a speck of dust , Geemie , with a bit of life in it . I am precious to myself still , and I am the only gift I have to give . Please take me . " " I am afraid I will hurt you , Marjetta . " It was lame but true . She looked so fragile in the moonlight , her limp body a picture of passive vulnerability . Damn her , she knows how to surrender . " I do not care whether you hurt me or not , Geemie . I just want to be yours . I ask nothing from you . Just enjoy me for a little while and then forget me . You are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want to lose the chance to be with you even if it is only for a few days . " He placed his hands on her slender waist , fingers drawing her to him . " Sure , Margie , I 've loved you since the first moment I set eyes on you . " He was passing the point of no return . Hunger was now stronger than fear . Her skin felt like the fine Taran linen on the Cardinal 's table . " I 'll not be forgetting you and it wo n't be just for a few days that I will love you . " " Do not speak of love , Seamus . I think I feel it , but too much has happened for me to know what it is . I just know I can not go on living unless I belong to you . " Her lips opened , her eyes grew round and vacant , her heart beat furiously under the touch of his fingers . Voices screamed in his throbbing head , warning him of  | the dangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her body , exploring her womanly splendors , and she tensed in response , her face wincing with fear . " I 'll speak of love if I want to , woman . I know what it is . " I 'm being seduced by a frightened virgin who expects me to take over the seducing . His lips began explorations of their own , testing the sweetness of her flesh . There was softness and surrender in her now . " Whatever it is , I accept it . " His hands were still moving over her ; she had relaxed under their touch . " Well , it 's this . When this night is over , I 'm considering you my mate for the rest of my life . If you ever try to get out of it , idjit , I 'll spank you within an inch of your life , do you hear ? " He patted her glorious rear end in feigned warning and his voice was soft and husky . She began to cry . " Forever , Geemie . And even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passion finally wild . Easy , me boy , this one will break if you 're not careful . He reined in his ardor and began to slowly and lovingly prepare her for their union .  | The great ugly lake glared at Seamus O'Neill ; its twisting vegetation seemed to grasp eagerly for his soul . The Black Mood was upon him , the worst of all the Taran emotional afflictions . " Self-pity and infidelity , " the Captain Abbess would snap when informed that one of her subjects " has taken the Black Mood , Y'r Reverence . " But the Black Mood was not cured by the Cardinal 's wrath nor by the ministrations of the medical team , nor by the prayers of the monks . It eventually went away , however . If the Lady Deirdre were to be believed , it went away when the victim decided to act " like an adult and a sworn pilgrim again . " There was no record of a Black Mood being fatal . Nor indeed of it ever being permanent . But that datum brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Mood . They were convinced that their case would be the exception that proved the rule . Seamus had been the victim of it only once in his life before . He could n't even remember the reason , though he always thought that some of his best poetry had been written when the Mood was upon him . Now he was n't writing poetry or singing songs . He had repaired his harp , without the slightest hesitation . He had used it to sing love songs to his bride , love songs he had not yet written down and now claimed to himself that he had forgotten . The Mood had hung on for days . In some twisted way he was beginning to like it . lie kicked a rock into the dark  | waters of the Great Lake . Damn it and damn Zylong ; damn Iona and , above all , damn Marjetta . Damn him , too . The mess was his fault . Had his brain become so numbed by sex that he could n't think anymore ? Now he had them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mountain he had made nothing but mistakes . He was responsible for Marjetta 's deterioration . The Iona had written him off completely : if it had n't left orbit before , it was sure to now , leaving him to rot in this moldy jungle by himself for the rest of his natural life , which would n't be very long . Maybe the reason he had been so harsh with Margie was that he was taking some of his self-hatred out on her ? though heaven knows the woman would have driven a monk to drink . He had shouted at her that if she felt that way she ought to go out into the jungle and die . Without a word she had picked up and was gone , never turning back . " Do n't be in any hurry to come crawling back , " he had shouted after her . She did n't come crawling back , either , as he assumed she would . God in heaven , the woman would try the patience of a saint . He had n't meant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely had been venting his anger ? Well , he 'd tell her a thing or two when she finally returned . " The back of me hand to you , woman , " he 'd shout , though that would n't mean anything either . A proper Taran wife ought to know when her man was only talking . She 's not a Taran , you dummy . Shut up . When I want your opinion , I 'll ask for it . She had left in early morning ; now it was almost night . Appalled by the enormity of what he had said and done , he had plunged recklessly through the jungle calling her name . Her behavior was unpredictable . He should have held his temper and fought the thing out some other way . The Zylongi had this crazy " deciding - todie " thing in which you turn off  | your vital processes . In the state the poor girl was in , she might have done just that . This is our honeymoon , he told himself . We should n't be fighting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idjit . You got carried away by your passions . The Abbess always warned you about that . God knows , she had experience enough of it herself when she was younger . Why were n't you after listening to her ? The woman is nothing more than a child , not much older than Retha . Would you practically rape that little tyke ? And she 's never been in love before . And you 're an experienced man of the galaxy and a great traveler besides . You were a badly matched couple to begin with . If you 'd had any sense at all , you would have never laid a hand on her . He kicked another rock . It bounced against a floating log and shot back at him . Even the lake was fighting him . Well , now , it really was n't rape . She wanted it as much as you did . You should have said no . Easy enough for you to talk . Their first coupling had not been a complete success , to put the matter mildly . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as bad as she . No , to tell the truth , maybe worse . It had not been all that bad , either . They both laughed at their own awkwardness and turned what might have been a disaster into a happy comedy . They played with each other 's bodies and laughed themselves to sleep . They improved as lovers with practice . The woman was a quick study , God knows . They did n't provide much in the way of sex education on Zylong , even less than the Tarans received , which was n't much at all . But Margie was naturally good at everything , even lovemaking . Especially lovemaking , come to think of it . " Practice makes perfect , " he said to her the first morning , as he munched on some tasty jungle fruit that she assured him was safe , even a delicacy .  | " Good . Let 's practice more . I want to be perfect . " She literally jumped on him . Well , they had lots of practice during those idyllic days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and games at all . At all . His instinctive decision that she was the proper woman had been correct . Whatever else happened between them in the decades together that he cheerfully anticipated , she would never be dull in bed . Fight they might , but as Carmody had candidly told him , there are some kinds of women you ca n't stay away from . His Margie was one of those . And she had only begun to learn the arts of love . What would she be like when she was " perfect , " as she wanted to be ? " Practically perfect will be enough for me , " he had chuckled , removing his lips temporarily from a compliant breast . " You deserve perfection , my beloved , " she replied , tears of adoration in her eyes . Adoration one moment , fury the next . Worse than the worst of the Tarans . And that was bad . Of course , they had begun their life together in difficult circumstances . A walk through the jungles of Zylong was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , leaning a little bit against his Black Mood , we would have done all right if we were n't caught out here . What 's the point in thinking that ? We are caught out here . Then again , we ca n't stay in the jungle for the rest of our lives . After they left the pool to continue the long walk back toward the City , the jungle was not actively hostile . It looked like pictures he had seen of Precambrian forests of Earth . The reptilelike creatures who dwelt in it were small and fled quickly at their approach . There was an abundance of fruit and plenty of water . Though they 'd lost most of their equipment when the raft he 'd built overturned in the tributary he  | had foolishly insisted on fording at nightfall , staying alive was not difficult . And the crazy woman had to dive into the River to save my harp . As though being a bard made any difference anymore , the idjit . The jungle took its toll nevertheless . Underbrush , swamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dismal heat that was almost palpable under the sunscreen of giant trees ? drained their strength . With only one spear blade ( the precious tranquillity pills hidden in its handle ) and a carbine barrel , they fought for every inch of movement through the underbrush . A humid , thick perfume hung in the jungle air like overpowering incense . They were both sick . The inoculations Samaritha had given him back at the Body Institute protected him from the worst of the jungle diseases , but they were both listless , enervated , depressed . He was too besotted with fulfilled passion to recognize the beginning of the trouble with Marjetta . They had stayed at their " mating pool " four days , recovering from the mountains and exploring the delights of each other 's body . Practicing , as she called it . The days at the pool became unbearably delicious . His tenderness began to unlock her passions . Not only was her curiosity and her hunger a match for his , she was the more passionate . It was his tenderness that ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it could n't be in a culture that so strongly repressed individuality . If he had been any kind of an anthropologist , he would have realized that sex for the Zylongi was a brief , brutal act . If people like Sammy and Ernie had discovered there was something else to love , many more saw mating as a brief respite from the loneliness and isolation that a communitarian culture fostered in sensitive people . Tenderness and concern for the other were virtually unknown . So if a young woman goes through a series of disasters that wipes out all of her contacts with her own culture , and  | then discovers an unsuspected and overwhelming animal passion within herself , the result will be personality disorientation , even if she loves it and even if she insists on " practice " at every possible opportunity . And there are plenty of opportunities , if there 's nothing else to do but nibble on delicious fruit and if your man is an oversexed and undersatisfied pig . His judgment . Not hers . What happened was that Margie encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an ideal of the Taran culture  --  tenderness to one 's lover  --  that did her in . If O'Neill had quickly and forcefully ravaged her , it would have been what she expected ; nothing much would have been lost . After his first bumbling and clumsy failures , he had to become reasonably skilled at tenderness , play the great lover , and mess up everything . He could hear Deirdre now : " It 's all your fault , you idjit . You never could control your libido , could you ? " The fighting began as soon as they left the pool area . Within a day she disintegrated . She complained , disagreed , fought , argued , and nagged . He could hardly believe that it was his lovely Marjetta , the cheerful romping mate of a day or two ago . She knew what kind of complaint would irk him the most , what kind of barb would most quickly penetrate the chinks in his self-assurance . He should have fought it out at the beginning . He dodged , ducked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman  --  and made matters worse . The more she saw she could get away with , the more she pushed him . When he lost his temper finally , it was a blowup of monumental proportions that tore their relationship apart . The second night out in the jungle she pushed him away with the icy comment , " I will not couple with a man I do not respect . " His mistake was in letting her get away with it . He was so hurt that it had n't occurred to him till too late that he was being tested by an emotionally overwrought  | child . He should have laughed at her , joshed her , caressed her , and won her back . No , she had to go into her funk and I into my Black Mood . The Lord made us and the divil matched us . Their struggle through the jungle was mostly silent , punctuated by an occasional outburst of recrimination and complaint from Marjetta . According to the map , the journey should have been less arduous after they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course toward the lake for them to consider a raft , but after the Great Waterfall it flowed toward the City in what appeared to be a broad band of navigable water all the way down to the Zylong Plain . Again he had misjudged . When they had hacked their way to its shores , the lake was more sinister and more depressing than the jungle . It was still and smooth , shrouded in thick mists , filled with vegetation and rubble . " We are going to cross that ? " Margie had snarled . " We certainly are , " he had replied tartly  --  though he had decided not to try a crossing . But when she nagged him , he reacted by doing whatever she did n't want to do . So , against his better judgment , he ordered her to start working on a raft . That was a major mistake . They worked for a solid day , hacking away at trees with a stone ax he had devised and fashioning a crude raft out of logs and vines . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddles from the soft woody substance of the fernlike trees . In the morning the mist was even thicker . He insisted on setting off , despite her vigorous complaints . To give her credit , she did what she was told despite her complaints . The lake was liquid hell . They repeatedly fouled the raft in vegetation , collided with logs , and swirled dizzily in sudden and unpredictable currents . The heat and humidity were  | intolerable , the perfume of the forest replaced by the foul stench of rotting seaweed . The lake creatures were not nearly so timid as the jungle ones . A huge head thrust itself out of the mists of the lake and snapped a paddle in two . It might just as well have been an arm or a leg . " See , " Margie crowed triumphantly , " I told you the lake was dangerous . " They gave up and drifted into shore  --  though it might have been an island . The Black Mood rose up out of the fetid waters and claimed him . The mists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in any direction . O'Neill was disoriented . He did not know where they were or how they could find their way to the massive waterfall that began the main course of the River . He wanted to explore in one direction , Marjetta wanted to go another . They had gone his way  --  and discovered nothing but an impassable swamp . They were lost somewhere on the shore of a great dismal lake in the heart of a jungle . She berated him for all his failures and mistakes . " You are a bad poet , a worse soldier , and the worst possible explorer . How many more mistakes can you make before you will kill us both ? I would have been happier in Narth 's harem . " She could n't have meant it , of course . It was the last desperate cry of a frightened and disoriented child . He should have taken her into his arms and soothed and caressed her until she calmed down . Any man with an ounce of sense would have done just that . But Seamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't have even half an ounce of sense . " Shut up , " he bellowed . " Like all the people on this godforsaken planet , you 're a stupid fool , a coward , and a crybaby . You 're an intolerable bitch , too , and a lousy lover . " " How can one be a good lover with a clumsy rapist ? " He could n't take it any longer , he told himself in later attempts at self-justification . Ile ordered her out into the  | jungle . God knows , he had provocation enough . How was he to know that , dumb , literal-minded Zylongi bitch that she was , she 'd take him literally ? It was the end of everything . The end of the mission , the end of Marjetta , and soon the end of Seamus O'Neill . " Poor fella , " they 'd say back on the Iona . " It was a shame he had to die so young . Not a bad one , you know . A great poet , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And of course a first-class soldier . He just did n't have what was needed in a tight situation . Made a fine soldier but not much as a spy and a lover . ' T was a shame , ' t was indeed , but we did n't have anyone else to send , worse luck . " They would all sigh , then sigh again . A poor spy and a worse lover , such would be the epitaph of Seamus Finnbar Diarmuid Brendan Tomas O'Neill . After a while they would forget him altogether . He buried his head in his hands . Now would be the appropriate time to sob for his lost life and his lost love . But his Mood was so black that he could n't work up the energy for tears , which kind of ruined the effect . " Geemie , " a tiny voice from a great distance . I 'm imagining it . " Geemie , my love . " Ah no , it ' t is real enough . He decided he did n't want to look up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was Marjetta , standing silently , several yards down the shore of the steaming lake , tears rolling down her cheeks . His heart did a flipflop . Lord , she was beautiful , even after a week in the jungle . Despite the Black Mood he felt a surge of desire . " So , you decided to come back , did you , woman ? It took you long enough , " he muttered glumly . She had regained some of her self-possession . " May I sit here on this log ? " A tiny still voice . " It 's a free planet . " He sunk his head lower in his hands , trying not to look at her . " You can sit where you damn please . " Ile was n't giving an inch .  | " May I talk with you ? " A polite enough risk , modestly presented . " The good Lord Himself could n't stop that if you 'd made up your mind . " He burrowed his head further into his hands . She was being reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his feet and embraced his legs . " Dear master , forgive me . I am unworthy of you . I do n't deserve you . I 'm a worthless . . . bitch . A fool . An idjit . I could never again be your proper woman . Let me at least be a humble slave to serve your slightest whim . Please , please , wondrous master , forgive me . I 'll never offend you again . I promise . " Well , now that 's a bit much . Seamus removed his hands from his face and considered the trembling shoulders and heaving rib cage . Ah , she ca n't mean it , can she ? It 's nothing but stupid Zylongi exaggeration . Seamus O'Neill , you 're the idjit . One thing these poor heathens do n't do is exaggerate . The poor wee tyke thinks she can make it back only as a slave . That wo n't do at all , at all . He stood up , feeling a jab of pain in his back . Ah , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wouldbe slave unceremoniously to her feet . " You 'd make a rotten slave , woman . " " I could try . " She would not look at him . " Beat me if you wish , please beat me . I deserve to be terribly beaten . I 'll try to be a good slave . I really will . " " That wo n't do . The only thing you 'd be any good at is a wife . You 're much too bossy to be a slave . If there 's one thing I ca n't stand it 's a bossy slave woman . I 've had my share of them , let me tell you . Now there was that time on Galway when a bossy slave woman , two Wild Geese , and myself were having a quiet jar of the creature and ... " Her tears stopped . " Geemie , you 're joking . " " Not at all , at all . But I 'll tell you one thing , woman . There 'll be none of this slave and master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're my .. vife and that makes us equals ,  | which gives me an advantage because if you were n't my wife , you 'd clearly be superior . " " Geemie , " her eyes were shining . " As a matter of fact , " he was not going to quit when he was on a roll , " I 'll even stipulate that , wife or not , you are still a little bit superior to me , but not much . Is that clear ? " She nodded , so choked with emotion that she could not speak . " Now as for this beating stuff , we Tarans are not into it , if you take my meaning . Sure , occasionally we lose our tempers , but we hate ourselves afterward . A wife like you deserves a good spanking now and then .... " " Spank me if you wish . I deserve it . I ... " " Might even like it , huh ? Well , you 'll never get any of that from m.e , woman , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to me when I 'm in the wrong . Anyway , I can think of a lot better things to do with you , some of which I intend to try in a very few moments . " Not bad altogether . If I do say so myself . He kissed her cheek , a promise of reconciling love to come . God knows , I 'll have to tell Carmody he was right . " I am forgiven , then ? " She was radiant again , hardly able to believe her good fortune . What else did you expect , woman ? " If I 'm forgiven too . " She threw her arms around him . " I love you so . You are such a wonderful man . I am the most fortunate woman in the galaxy . " " At least . " She took a deep breath . The words bubbled out like a tumbling brook . " Seamus , what was wrong with me ? I fell apart . I was not me anymore . I am a soldier ; I believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in loyalty to my leader , but I tried to destroy your effectiveness . I believe that one should support one 's mate , but I let you down over and over . I love you , but I hurt you terribly . I wanted to die because I had failed you . I was about to die . This voice inside  | of me said , ' Go back to him , you little idjit , he needs you . ' So I came back . But you do n't really need me , do you ? Of course you do . You love me . What is happening ? " She broke down . " Oh , Geemie , please help me .... " How do you explain culture shock to a woman under such emotional stress ? He would make more of a mess of things to try . The sheer physical effort to attempt an explanation was beyond him . Better to let things go . " Margie , I ca n't help you , " he said with heavy resignation , but his heart was beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjetta continued breathlessly , her eyes begging , tearing at his heart , " I do n't want to hurt you , Geemie . I decided to die out there in the jungle . Then that voice inside me said that I would hurt you even more by dying . So I came back to try again . " " And glad I am you did . " His lips began to roam , her eyes , lips , ears , throat , chest . Love after fights is the best of all , Carmody said . Well , I 'll soon find out . " Tell me what is happening . Am I becoming insane ? " she pleaded . " I 'll tell you , but please , I am tired and worn-out and so are you . Listen to what I 'm saying and promise me you wo n't get angry ? " " I promise . " She wiped her tears . " But how can I listen if you play with my breasts that way ? " " That 's part of listening . " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her head and stroked her short , curly hair tenderly . He took a deep breath , crossed his fingers , partly to make up for any wee fibs he might have to tell and partly for luck , and began very carefully . " Well , it 's like this . . . . " He grinned . " You see , you were attracted to me partly because I am irresistible and partly because I am the opposite of the Zylongi , whose whole culture you were beginning to doubt . Remember you said you did n't want to live before you pulled me out of the drain ? "  | " And after I met you I became a revolutionary ? " Ah , she catches on quick . " You find out that your government has been systematically lying to you , that they are even trying to kill you . Sure most people would have caved in worse than you did . " She looked at him very seriously , drawing back slightly from his embrace , waiting for him to go on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a line of come-on blarney that you 'd never heard from any eligible Zylongi bachelor , we go through all that stuff in the desert and on the mountain ; then I turn gentle . Emotions come out you never knew you had , surrender , trust , passion , sexual playfulness . " I sound like the monk who gives our annual retreat . " It must have scared the hell out of you , so you try to protect yourself by becoming a child again . " Those last words were a mistake . She pulled back from him , furious . " How dare you say I 'm a child . I 'm just as adult as you are . More so . " He gritted his teeth and grabbed her arms very hard . " Woman , you are more so . I already said that . But show you 're adult by listening to me . " She clenched her fists and struggled to free herself . Then she began to laugh . " Seamus , you wonderful , lovable idjit . It 's splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're just going to have to treat me like a confused child . " And then she laughed like it was the greatest joke in the world . A dark nasty suspicion raised its deformed head in the back of his imagination . " It was a voice inside you that told you to come back ? What exactly would that voice have been saying ? " Her fingers stroked his face . " Oh , I do n't remember ... . Is it all that important ? " She felt his jaw tighten . " All right , darling , it is important . Let me see ... the voice said , ' Get back there , you idjit , the poor man needs you . ' Yes , those were the words . "  | " Poor man . " That was n't Zylongi talk at all , it was pure Taran . Deirdre , I owe you one . So you are still listening and watching . The least you can do , woman , is give a man a little privacy .... She jarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding it back to her breasts . You get out of here , Your Eminence , and leave me and my proper woman in some decent privacy . You hear now ? " Are n't you ever going to couple with me again ? " his woman asked plaintively . " Indeed I am , woman , " he sighed . If the Abbess wanted to play voyeur , he 'd give her quite a show . " Like you 've never been coupled before . " " Wonderful , " she sighed happily . " You 're such a good man . " " And after that ? " " Yes , master ? " she grinned wickedly . " After that ? " Sure she was n't the only one whose passions had changed " ? after that , we 're going down to Zylong City and clean out that mess so decent people like you and me can live there in peace and freedom . "  | The saber-toothed tiger bounded toward Seamus like a demon sent from hell . It was , he noted as he fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . God had made a mistake in upgrading the harmless kitten into such a fearsome beast . As long as the Dev , he estimated as the tiger leaped , its long and fearsome teeth aimed at his neck . He realized he would not raise his spear in time . It 's been an interesting life . " Marjetta ! " he screamed , knowing that it would be his last word . Somehow she slipped between him and the soaring beast , jammed her spear into its chest , and twisted the fearsome animal out of its line of flight . It rolled over next to Seamus in an angry spasm , growling and pawing the air with its huge claws as blood erupted from its gaping wound . Marjetta hurled Seamus savagely back from the dying animal . " Are you waiting for it to kill you , you bloody idjit ? It 's not dead yet . " Trembling and silent , Seamus let her pull him to the side of the tiny clearing in which they were camped . She continued to rage at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you stand there and stare at that awful thing ? Why did n't you pick up your spear and kill it ? You 're a bloody amadon . " " Why an amadon ? " he began to breathe again . " Because you 're the worst kind of idjit . Why did n't you kill it ? "  | " Well , partly because I was too scared to move .... " " I do n't believe that , " she snapped at him . " And partly because I did n't know how to . " " Oh , of course . " Small contrite voice . " I assumed that they had these ugly creatures on all planets and that you had practiced killing them , like soldiers do here . " " You practice on real ones ? " " Of course not .

" " The holy saints be praised , " she threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost lost you ! " " I owe you about a half dozen now . " He crushed her in his own arms . " Sure that thing had its eye on my throat . Come on , woman , let 's sit down before we both collapse . " They huddled together on the floor of the forest , avoiding the sight of the dead tiger and trying to calm their shattered nerves . " I have a confession to make , " she said calmly . " I knew I 'd have to tell you eventually . Now I must tell you . . . before something else happens . " Seamus stirred uneasily . She was a complex mixture of woman , comic mimic , grateful child , passionate lover , and fiercely quick soldier . The last had been quiet lately as she docilely followed her husband through the jungle . Do n't kid yourself , Seamus Finnbar O'Neill , she 's still a handful . " Confess away , darling girl . " " No Zylongi maiden strips for a stranger the way I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure now , I did n't mind getting a first view ? " he held her close " ? of the merchandise , if you take my meaning .

" I 'll not be distracted by your foolishness . I wanted to seduce you . I was terribly at- tracted to you the first moment I saw you ... that 's why I was so rude , understand ? " " I think so . " " I thought I would die soon ; I wanted to be ravished once before I died ; a red-bearded god would be better than most lovers ; so .. . well , you know what I did . " " I do ....

" Nothing , I guess . " " Herself says that when we know what it is really like to love and be loved , we know what God is like . " " How beautiful . Your god  --  Jesus , is it ? ? feels about me like I do about you ? He loves me the way you love me ?

" " It 's a prayer to my guardian angel . . . they 're spirits God sends to take care of us. "  | " Your god is so wonderful . Just like you . " She snuggled close to him . " I think I 'm ready now to make love , Seamus . " " I was afraid that would happen . " Afterward , when she slept complacently in his arms , Seamus wondered why the great need to confess what should have been obvious to any man who was smart enough to realize that he was the pursued and not the pursuer . " Someone as smart as me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day they encountered a band of well-armed hordi . Again it was Marjetta who was alert to the danger first . She sniffed the air . " Someone coming , Geemie , take cover . " It was an order , not a request . O'Neill did what he was told and followed her into a cluster of crimson bushes that reminded his guilty conscience of the Cardinal herself . Sure enough , a band of about forty hordi males , with females and young trailing behind , padded down the side of the lake , armed to the teeth with knives , spears , and clubs almost as big as they were . On the lake itself several large canoes , jammed with more weapons and supplies and steered by a massive rudder , were drifting at the same speed the aborigines were walking . O'Neill and his woman waited motionless till the band had disappeared . " We would n't have provided much more than an appetizer for that crowd , " he said when she rose from the bushes . " It 's a war party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marching toward the City . " " They 're going to storm the City with spears and clubs ? " " As part of Narth 's army . He 'll send them across the River first to see if the laser weapons are operational . If they die , then Narth knows not to attack . " " Iles dead . "  | " Is he ? " she asked skeptically . " I hope so . " " So the Outsiders do n't think the hordi are human ei-ther ? " " Of course not . They 'll use them and kill them too . Why should they be any different from us ? " " But you think they 're human ? " " Sometimes I think they 're more human than we are . And , however they may have come here , they were here first . " " So even if ... I mean after we win in the City , we will have to do something about them , wo n't we ? " She stooped to pick up her pack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand years of mistakes ? " Well , now that was a very intelligent question . " I 'd sign up Quars to begin negotiations with them . He 's got his head screwed on right . " She smiled proudly . " That 's my Seamus . No one in this whole world would have thought of that . " Seamus was not sure that he agreed or that her proud smile was justified . What do I know about politics ? " Freedom for everyone , darling ? " she squeezed his arm " ? including those poor little creatures . " " For everyone , " he agreed with a certain lack of enthusiasm . " Come , we must hurry to the City before it is too late . Freedom for everyone ! "  | Many days later , having spent a restless night worrying about freedom , Seamus O'Neill opened one eye as the morning sun forced its way into the control cabin of the Eamon De Valera . There was a naked woman standing at the entrance hatch , her strong young body bathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at him with tolerant adoration . Quickly he closed the eye . Ah , the woman will be the death of me . Was n't it bad enough , her laughing at me every inch of the way from the Great Lake ? She wants to make love at this heathenish hour of the morning , and myself trying to decide whether to go into that damn City today . He sighed quietly for fear of stirring up her pagan passions even more if she knew he was awake . The last thing he 'd expected was that the woman would turn into a comic . She had barely smiled till they got to Hyperion . Now she was laughing and dancing all the day long , even with the two of them exhausted . She must have always been a comic , just hiding it from me so I would n't know what I was getting caught in . He was afraid again , but it passed quickly . Her unexpected humor had kept him going when he was ready to give up , down the long , twisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She says the same things she said before our fight , but now they 're a joke . What am I going to do with her ? He knew what she wanted him to do ... it 'd wear a man out .... It all started the day after they had seen the hordi by the lake .... That morning he awoke to find Marjetta gone . The carbine was gong with her . A weather change dissolved the lake  | mists , the wind was brisk , the sun shone warm . She had probably gone off to do some exploring  --  he hoped . She was back , eyes dancing . " We 've found our waterfall , Seamus O'Neill . Sure , if you had ears like a Zylongi you would have woken up this morning to hear its roar . Hurry , darling , it 's the most amazing thing you 'll ever see . " Seamus had seen a lot of marvels in various parts of the galaxy , but the Great Waterfall of Zylong took the prize . Almost without warning the whole lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could not see the other end of it , lost as it was in the rainbow mists . The fall was dazzling in the sunlight ; the spray blew in their faces , soaking them . O'Neill and Marjetta hugged and danced . " Geemie . . . " Her face turned glum , her fingers dug into his arm . " If we get through all this , will they let you back on Tara ? " Why , of all times , would she pick now to ask me that ? " Oh , 1 think my friends will have enough political power to get things set up for me , " he said airily . Where 's the woman going now ? " Will Deirdre help ? " And then , seeing the surprise on his face , she quickly added , " You remember . You told me about the ugly old religious leader who was your friend . How old did you say she was ? " " Oh , eighty or ninety of our years at least , and ugly as sin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the morning with the most beautiful scenery in Zylong to gaze at ... " she said reprovingly . " Geemie , you have no self-control at all . " " Sure , the breasts of a beautiful woman will beat a waterfall for scenery any morning . " " Zylongi men are not much interested in breasts . Do you have a fixation ? Do all Tarans ? " she asked maliciously . " I 'll tell you what , woman . If you do n't like my fixations , you can go and find yourself one of those cold-blooded Zylongi creatures . Do n't forget you 're mated to a Taran , peculiarities and all . "  | He was ready to climb down the side of the mountain to the base of the falls . But the woman was in her playful mood . She wrestled him to the ground , overcoming his not completely make-believe resistance , pinned him on his back , and peeled off his clothes . " Taran or not , my darling Geemie , you have a wonderful male body and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts if you want to , but hold still . I want to play with you . " " That seems fair enough , " he sighed , willingly yielding himself to her demands . Sure , I knew all along , she was the proper woman . " Only stop tickling me , woman . That 's too much altogether . " " No , I wo n't . I 'll never stop . How do you like that ? " Ah , the practice has paid off after all . So they played all morning , swimming in a pool at the edge of the falls , admiring the rainbows in the foam , wrestling and making love again and again and again . It was the beginning of a true honeymoon , an orgy of love that went on no matter what the hardships of their long march were . And she can never have enough of me . That 's a little more than I bargained for . Ah , but the Black Mood never did come back . There 's that , is n't there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced and sang her heathenish songs , troubled thoughts gnawed at his mind and heart . Margie he 'd never give up , no matter what . And he meant it about bringing freedom to Zylong . But true Taran that he was , on later reflection he threw in a qualification that gave him an escape hatch from his spontaneous outburst . They 'd bring freedom to Zylong if it were possible to do that . Only he was not at all sure that it was possible . No one is held to the impossible , are they ? What was the phrase the Lady Abbess used ? Ad impossibile nemo tenctur . Right . Tomorrow was " go " or " no go " for the Iona . If  | they wanted to end the mission , this was the day to do it . He had made that very clear to them . He knew now they were listening , probably had been all along . If herself was meddling , unasked mind you , in his private life , she was certainly tuned in to his public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , they 'll be singing songs about me and my woman for a thousand years . Who was this Finn MacCool anyway ? But they had to make up their minds . Sure , I 'm delivering you an ultimatum . Either pull me and me woman out of this heathen place now , or I 'm going along with the conspiracy and we 'll invite you down , once we take over . I do n't think we have much of a chance of winning , but it 's the only alternative . And I 'll be expecting your help , are you hearing me now ? None of this " poor Seamus " stuff while I 'm providing earlyevening entertainment for you . I 'm not breaking any Rules exactly . Have n't they been after asking me to join them ? But either you pull me out now  --  you hear me , My Lady Countess , Abbess , Captain , Cardinal ? ? or you 're going to have to take full responsibility for what happens . I 'll not let you slip away with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clear , does n't it ? All right , you think that because Seamus O'Neill has proved himself a moderately adequate lover  --  no I 'll redo that , a superlative lover  --  success has gone to his head and he 's talking big with nothing behind . Well , let me tell all of you something . I love the woman . I 'll do anything for her . I do n't want to have to choose between you and her , but if you force me to , you know whose side I 'm going to be on . Note , he added with a touch of placating reflection , a little bit of mental blarney , that all I 'm doing is following the Bible about cleaving to my woman because we 're two in one flesh . You 'd expect me to say what I 'm saying . And if good sex makes me a mire obnoxious bastard than 1  | was before , well , guys , you 're just going to have to live with that . Understand ? The radio banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be alert for a signal . If none came , he could assume that they wanted him to proceed into the City with Marjetta to finish what she planned to start . He was afraid to think of just what kind of finish it would be . Iona did n't need any more information . Zylong was in extremis ; Podraig 's estimate of a fifty  --  fifty chance of a blowup seemed conservative  --  especially with the introduction of Marjetta 's revolutionary scheme . He had moved from information gatherer to active participant , which was counter to direct orders from Deirdre . How did she and the Grand Council feel about that ? Did they know the two crucial things he had discovered about the Zylongi in this romp through the jungle ? The Zylongi , even the strong ones , were prone to intense culture-shock regression , and there seemed to be strong undercurrents of wit that sustained the intelligent and sensitive ones despite the pressures of their rigid society . Ernie 's often savage irony was a manifestation of this ; Margie was supported by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped her cavorting , came to him , and put a cool , tender hand on his forehead . I ca n't help myself , I 've fallen in love with the woman . " Do you really want to go back ? " she asked gently , as she had last night , " because if you want to take our chances in space , I 'll come with you . " " Do you want that ? " " No . I have an obligation to my people . But now I have an obligation to you too . I will do what you want . " Hear her ? Two in one flesh . Just like me . " Well , " he had told her last night , " let 's think about it tonight and make up our minds tomorrow . " Now it was tomorrow , and she wanted to make love again . Which , for all his complaints about exhaustion , was what he wanted  | too . She was so deliciously , wonderfully , irresistibly beautiful , especially when her clothes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . " He grabbed her arm and wrestled her to the control couch . She giggled and pretended to struggle and then pulled him down on top of her . He held her immobile and drank in her loveliness . " You are so beautiful , my love . " " Thank you , " she twisted in mock resistance . " And your beauty only reveals who and what you are . Marjetta 's body is not as beautiful as she is . " " Are you going to make me cry or are you going to make me love you ? " " How about both ? " " That sounds nice .... I like that . Do it again . " " Glutton . " " It 's your mouth , not mine . " All right , if it was n't for the joy and pleasure of this woman , I would n't be nearly so fierce . " I 'm happy , " he whispered to her , " for the first time since my parents were killed . " " Yours too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Geemie ? " " If you 're their mother . " " Who else ? ... Oh , Geemie , that 's wonderful , do n't stop . " " You 're not trying to tell me something ... " If she were pregnant , that would complicate things terrible . " Just asking . .. . Oh ... please do n't stop . " Then he was too busy to think . Later , while she was out in the jungle collecting fruit for breakfast , he returned to his reflections . If a signal came from Iona , they would certainly leave . Since it had n't come yet , probably it would n't . Give them another half day , just in case there was a debate up there that herself wanted to sort out . He could decide to end the mission himself . A single alert message from his transmitter and protection from the mon- astery against the Zylongian phasers would be at his service  --  he hoped . Were he to seek refuge on Iona now , what would his reception be ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end the mission , that in fact he had performed it at all ? Or did continued silence mean the decision had already been taken  --  to write off O'Neill as an agent whose mission had failed ? Or were the Council and Her Ladyship , the Captain Abbess , waiting for developments ? Perhaps the message to him was simply to go on . He had made friends on Zylong  --  people he cared about , like Ernie , Sammy , Horor , Carina , poor little Retha , who was probably dead on the desert with whatever was left of that sad , brave troop of soldiers . And Marjetta  --  she whose strength and humor pulled them through the jungles , she who touched his life like no one ever had , she whose commitment to her people was placing her in extreme danger . How could he possibly leave her ? How could he be the instrument of wrenching her away from her people now that they were on the edge of catastrophe ? She shook his shoulders .. . the same firm hands that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lovely lady , " he said brightly , putting his arm around her waist . She kissed him tenderly . " Good morning , Honored Major . Fallen asleep again ? Did I wear you out ? Here is breakfast . Did you sleep well ? " Laughing at me again . " I 've had worse naps , " he admitted with feigned reluctance , pulling her down on top of himself . " Do I see by the light in your eyes that your passions are raging again ? So soon ? " Her hands lovingly caressed his face . Ah , it is the tenderness ... the terrible tenderness that wrenches your heart , scaring the living daylights out of you . " It 's what the sight of you does to me , Geemie .... " Now the damn rourrrcrrr is rrt/t  --  lg.  | Afterward , she sat next to him on the couch . " Are we going to the City ? " " Did you ever doubt it ? " " No . " " Well , then , let 's wake them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pills in my medical kit . We 'll leave them out here for the time being . No point in risking their being confiscated in the City . " Several hours later they were on a hovercraft with four soldiers and their commander , Captain Yens  --  who really did look like he was ten Taran years old  --  heading back to the City . All of his troops were members of the Young Ones . The conversation about the past several weeks was unhindered by the need to repeat official truth . " Comrade Captain , " Yens formally addressed Marjetta , " we rejoice that you and the Hero Poet are alive . " Marjetta returned , " Comrade Captain , we rejoice that you are here to meet us . Poet O'Neill , may I present you to Honored Captain Yens ? " O'Neill figured that he 'd better get to what was on both their minds . " I trust your respected future mate is well , Captain ? " he asked with all his formal dignity , his throat constricting at the thought that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She has never been better , Honored Poet Hero Guest . I do not exaggerate . Marvelous things happened to her on her desert ventures . " " Tell me , Captain , do you like the changes ? " " Indeed , Noble Hero . She has gained strength and .. . determination . I would not have it otherwise . " His eyes danced with the light of a man who was thoroughly captivated . " Glad to hear it , Yens . You seem to be a man after my own heart . " O'Neill smiled . " Thank you , Honored Sir . Could you provide the answer to one trivial question for me ? What is an ' idjit ' ? " " Ah , well now , he 's a kind of high-powered amadon , " Seamus replied wisely .  | " I see , sir . Fascinating . " He looked a little puzzled . Much had happened in their absence . The death of the Fourth Secretary had been announced as simply a " tragic accident . " The Sixth Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old fool , " snapped Marjetta . " During Festival he pursues maidens . " The Committee , already inept and stodgy , was now even less able to cope with its problems . The campaign to dispose of Marjetta was dropped , Retha and her troops were allowed to return unmolested . Narth 's death removed the threat of the Outsiders and other denizens of his " empire . " In the City , the Hooded Ones were becoming still bolder . With the confusion and drift at the top , the chances of the Young Ones increased . The Committee would move against no one before harvest . " Are you with us , Marjetta ? " asked Yens eagerly . " Until death , Yens . " " Until freedom , " he amended . All their faces shone with the fervor of commitment . Brigid , Patrick , and Columcile , they have imaginative slogans . Yens asked Marjetta urgently , " You have the pills ? " " I have . They are safely hidden . " Her eyes glowed with a martyr 's enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready for the lions . " Major O'Neill is with us ? " " Of course , " she responded decisively . Hey , wait a minute , fellows , I did n't volunteer for anything . They all turned to him . " Freedom , Seamus O'Neill ! " " Freedom , indeed , " he said , without any particular enthusiasm . They did n't notice .  | Though . ais face was burning with embarrassment , Seamus was laughing as loudly as the rest . All right , the witch is a superb mimic ; but she does n't have to ape my voice and my gestures so perfectly . Nor is there any reason to tell them the story of my tipping over the raft or bungling the attack of the saber-tooth . A man receives no proper respect at all anymore . Well , 1 ' 11 fix her later in the night . " So then the heroic Major said , ' No , we will do it my way , ' and the whole craft spun over into the water . He falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ? I was able to drag him out of the water again . It seems like I must do this all the time .. . it is not completely unpleasant . .. but he is so large that it grows tiresome ... would any of you like to issume responsibility for keeping our Honored Guest from crowning himself ? " She managed to keep a straight face when she asked the question , though the stars in her brown eyes were dancing with mischief . Hers was the only straight face in the room , though . iamaritha , Ornigon , Horor , and Carina were convulsed with most un-Zylongian merriment . Margie 's highly fictional and eery selective description of their " voyage " through the jun ; le had amused them for most of the " small entertainment " t the Music Director 's house  --  and she 'd only made it halfvay through the trip . O'Neill was cast in the role of the ambling hero saved by a brave and resourceful woman ... role which was uncomfortably close to reality . Sure you 'd love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much like you altogether . In his own mind , he had made up a bawdy ballad which  | would describe in the same fictional style the bedding of Marjetta . But he could n't sing it . First of all , it would shock the Zylongi into horrified silence . Secondly , it was not clear to him that any of the locals realized that Marjetta had become his proper woman . It was a subject that was discreetly avoided . " Oh , Geemie , you must have had such a wonderful time in the jungle , " gasped his hostess , her dark features rosy red with efforts to control her laughter . Now what did she mean by that ? Was it obvious to everyone that Margie 's glowing vitality meant she 'd found a man to sleep with ? Maybe in this society folks did n't dare notice such signs that the rules were being broken . " Well , I 'm glad I 'm providing my hosts with amusement . Sure it 's the least I can do . " He tried to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , now , Honored Guest , " protested Ornigon , " you must permit us some amusement . . . there are difficult times ahead . . . . " A quick frown crossed the man 's face . He regretted he had said it . There was an anxious pause , suddenly all the faces serious ; then Margie hastily plunged on to the days they were lost in the mists . Some of the gusto went out of her wit . His friends were more relaxed with him than when he first arrived , more ready to laugh and joke . With their openness came a revelation of the deep foreboding with which they faced the coming Festival . They seemed to sense that their society and their lives teetered on the edge of a deep pit . The young people knew that their revolution was just ahead . Even if they whistled in the dark when they were with each other , they must still privately be terrified . How could Margie laugh ? ... Maybe there were some Celtic genes somewhere from her past ... just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attended a meeting of the revolutionaries . Firmly taking his hand , Margie led him underground . They descended three levels beneath the City , under the basement level of the great buildings , lower than the vast underground transportation and communication network , to  | the level of the old granaries , now abandoned and musty . In the floor of one of these ancient storerooms there was a rusty hatch that pulled up with surprising ease . Stone steps led down to another , much smaller room , which appeared to be of even more ancient vintage . Out of this room ran a network of tunnels to still more chambers . The City was built , like ancient Rome on Earth , over catacombs . Margie told him that these underground chambers were more extensive than anyone could accurately describe , because official teaching denied their existence . The Reorganizers were afraid of the underground network  --  they themselves had used it for planning their own revolution . Tonight 's meeting was to be held in what was supposed to have been the Reorganizers ' headquarters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very young revolutionary , " came into being oppression , and here also will come into being freedom . " There was n't much in the group of forty young people who had piled into the meeting room that would give hope for their success . The idea of their overthrowing an ancient social structure and establishing a new one would have been a joke were they not so serious . Their leader was an oldyoung man named Chronos , a marginal instructor in philosophy at the university . Though his gray hair marked him as a man in his forties , he maintained the language and enthusiasm of youth . Chronos was not a military or political leader . He was a mystical visionary with dreamy eyes and a beatific smile . He talked about freedom as if its simple attainment would solve all the problems of Zylongian society . They would seize the Military Center , break into its arsenal for more carbines and ammunition ( they had only ten guns , a few hundred pounds of ammunition , and a couple score small explosive charges in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building and the Energy Center , thus gaining control of three-fourths of the Central Plaza , which should ensure a successful takeover of the government .  | It would be a " purifying fire of freedom ! " Chronos finished his ringing appeal to action . What would catch fire , how it would be put out , and what would rise from the ashes did n't seem worth his consideration . The young people loved it . Enthusiasm might enable them to carry out the quick , simple thrust of their bold strategy  --  although a thousand things could go wrong with it . After the Committee , what ? No one seemed to know or care . These Young Ones were not much different from the Hooded Ones ; they both saw no farther than the destruction of existing institutions . Marjetta whispered into his ear . " You see why it took so long for me to join them ; the man is appalling . He is far worse than an amadon . " Well , at least his woman was n't being taken in . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? " " All the others are even worse ; these have some strategy and plan . The rest are mystics , dreamers , and mad anarchists . " Seamus had nothing against mystics , dreamers , or anarchists . Many Tarans were all three . But Chronos would never have been permitted on the Iona . " Emotionally unstable , " Podraig would have announced , with an appropriate volley of foul words . " Six out of ten chances of a breakdown . " That would have been that . After his speech and the singing of the freedom song , Chronos took his leave , greeting the two new members of the group  --  Marjetta and O'Neill  --  with polite disinterest . Yens , Horor , Margie , and O'Neill , the de facto high command , remained behind . O'Neill promptly demanded to know about what they expected to happen after power was seized . The idea did n't seem to be important to the young people . They were not hypocrites , planning to set themselves up as a new Committee to oppress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaos that was bound to result there could be something much worse than the present dictator- ship . The forces tearing Zylong apart would do their work regardless of the Young Ones . The question was , who would pick up the pieces ? After the others left , Margie stood on tiptoe and kissed the back of his neck . " Come with me , Geemie . " And she led him to one of the small rooms that branched off a corridor exiting from the larger meeting room . She had somehow managed to furnish it with a number of soft Zylongi cloaks , much like their desertwear but more finely woven . He was still disturbed , and too upset by the evening 's events to appreciate the promise these accommodations offered . " You do n't like it , dear Geemie ? " she asked sorrowfully . " Would you expect me to be jumping up and down in celebration , woman ? A pack of amadons and onchoks , presided over by a psycho , and they 're organizing a revolution and then a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the targets . Sure they all ought to be put permanently on your tranquillity pills . " " What 's an onchok ? " " A female amadon ! " he replied tartly . " Glory be , I learn more about your language every day . " She was now tenderly stroking his hair . " Seamus , I have some news . First , the hordi army did not disintegrate when Narth died . There is a new leader , a man named Popilo , our former Army Commander who was sent into exile last year . " " You mean they 've got a full-fledged General out there ? And I bet he 's just the opposite of the poor old fella that 's sitting in his chair now . " He put his arms around her . An idjit she might be , but she certainly filled your arms nicely . He kissed her forehead , though clumsily because he was still trying to think about the revolution . " He is smart , tough , and very ambitious , which is why the Committee got rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime of Bonapartism  --  which he was . " She pulled his robe off , running her hands quickly down his back . " What kind of man was he ? " He slipped off her garment .  | Sure he was n't going to be the only naked person at the party . " Cruel , Geemie , very cruel . I think he is sick emotionally  --  even worse than Narth . I had him as a teacher when I was a Cadet . He ... he is a very bad man . " " And what 's the other bit of bad news ? Out with it woman . " He began to kiss her ; his lips quickly found their way to her wonderful , swelling young breasts . Ah , you 're a lucky man , O'Neill , despite all your complaints . " If you keep that up , I wo n't be able to tell you .... I did n't mean stop , Geemie , just a little slower . Uhm , that 's very nice . Well , the second news is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do nothing about you . They feel that you wo n't do anything unless you are attacked . They now think they can deal with you after the Festival . " His fingers gripped her waist . Time now to sweep her to the crude couch  --  no  --  one last question .... " And who 's going to lead this thing when Chronos falls apart ? . . . Some of you must have thought about what comes afterward .... " In the dim light of the portable lantern her eyes were now dreamy with longing , her nipples rigid against his chest . She hesitated before answering . " That is not important . " The longing eyes darted away from him . So that 's the way the story goes . He pushed her unceremoniously onto the makeshift bed , grabbed for his clothes , and began to dress . " You 're a bitch , Margie ! " he exploded . " I would n't make love to you tonight for all the coin on this damn planet ! " Truth to tell , all desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the cloak-strewn floor , dispirited and guilty . " What have I done , Seamus ? " she asked weakly . " Please forgive me . Whatever it is , I did not intend it . " " We were n't even back in the City and you were volunteering my services for this harebrained revolution of yours ... , " he said , sulking . " Now you 've got me pegged to he the leader . Well , let me tell you one thing , woman ... you 're not going "  | " ? I am truly sorry , Good Mate , " she interrupted . " I did n't mean . .. I hardly . .. but ... oh , I am so sorry . Please forgive my ignorance and stupidity . I will never learn , I fear . ... Do n't ... I should have told you . I did n't know how to put it . " She was weeping now . " Everyone takes it for granted that you will lead us . You act like a leader ... we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gracefully she stood up . Damn naked woman , do n't try to charm me . She touched his arm soothingly " Do n't be angry with me for too long .. . we have so little time together . " His heart turned from butter to cream . He patted her backside affectionately and drew her close . " Ah , sure , woman , you 're right . I 'd be no damn good as a follower . But I 'm no king or ruler either , do you hear me ? Just a temporary military chief , that 's all . Do you understand that ? " He tightened his grip . Well , maybe 1 ' 11 not throw her out tonight after all . " Yes , darling , " she said , nodding submissively . " All right , then . " But he still did n't believe her completely . Later , after they had slept , she whispered in his ear , " Were you angry because I made fun of you at the entertainment tonight ? " He swatted her backside harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible disrespectful . " " It was not . You loved every second of it . Tarans do n't care what you say about them as long as you make them the center of attention . " " You 'll be getting yourself raped again , if you say things like that . " He kissed her delicately , waiting for his physiology to catch up with his affection . " It 's true , " she sighed . " Do n't deny it . " " What you have n't figured out , woman , is that we are disappointed if our friends do n't ridicule us just a little . Sure a proper wife ought to make fun of her husband now and again so everyone knows that she loves him . "  | " You did n't fight back . " She stroked his chest . " That was n't fair . " So he sang a few stanzas of the bawdy ballad he 'd written about her loss of virginity , the refrain of which was " Seamus , roll the woman over again . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself laughing as he went on . " That would have been terrible , " she managed to say between spasms of laughing . " It would have shocked everyone . I would have been delighted ... but it is well that you did n't do it . The poor Research Director would never recover . " The image of a shocked Sammy seemed to delight her especially . So O'Neill , ever eager to keep his proper woman amused , made up some new stanzas . " Does it ever stop ? " she demanded . " Does the poor woman ever get loved ? " " A proper Taran ballad never stops , but the woman does get loved . Let me show you . " So he did . Later , as they slipped out of their temporary trysting place into the dim unfriendly light of a Zylongian dawn , O'Neill , complacent and well satisfied with himself , realized that he would do almost anything she wanted . Lust was spent after a passionate , almost despairing night together . Love was stronger than ever . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dodging : he could not live without her . Now look at the trouble Your Fine Eminence has got me into .  | O'Neill reached for his knife . There was someone coming up from the beach . He tensed for the attack . He knew enough about how the Zylongi behaved during harvest to be ready for anything . He moved to the side of the tent opening and stood quietly . It was Sammy who lifted up the flap of the tent , her body sleek and wet from the River . " Geemie , " she announced breathlessly , " we thought you would be lonely , so we have come to visit you . " Her eyes were wide with delight . Energy Supervisor Niora and State Painter Reena , the two guests at his first nourishment on Zylong , followed her in  --  equally breathless and equally clad only in their undergarments . There was much laughter , shaking of hair , removing of clothes to dry , and toweling of ripe womanly bodies . Like the women 's locker room next to the hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peek inside that sanctum save in his fantasy . Modesty apparently was n't a problem during harvesttime . He was not to worry , they assured him , nobody would bother them . They had brought cakes in a waterproof bag and merely wanted to drink la-ir with him and sing songs . The harvest ritual had begun with pep rallies , citizens singing and swinging their harvesting tools in all the plazas of the City , three days before the actual harvest began . On the third day , Sammy and Ernie had bundled him off to the Island with a tent , food , a large quantity of hoteen , and a  | pile of books . The word had come down from the Committee that he could n't stay in the City and could n't visit the fields during the sacred ritual of the harvest . He was worried about Marjetta , despite the careful plans that had been made to rescue her and the rest of their friends before the Festival winds began to blow , and to provide them with the pills to control their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a harebrained scheme if he 'd ever heard of one , but he could n't think of anything better . On the first day of the harvest , the Zylongi assembled in small bands at their preassigned places and marched out of the City , singing lustily . Many came right down the plain to the River , where O'Neill could see them easily from his vantage point on the Island . Women worked below the River and men above it . Every action was ritualized and supported by chants  --  the swinging of the tool , the packing of the bundles , the loading of the hand-drawn carts , the rest periods , even swimming in the River before the evening meal . The rituals , the songs , the stylized movements were hypnotic ; the workers were in deep trance during their working hours . Their evening swim was designed to shake them out of it so that they could get some natural sleep before the wake-up signal for the next day 's activities . The horn sounding on the last day of harvest would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Dev for the tranquillity pills that his young allies would need when the sun set . Then their crazy revolt would begin . He had enough on his mind : he missed Margie desperately , he was worried about the crazy revolution . He did n't need the stimulation of these hyped-up and uncharacteristically excited women . Well , never let it be said that a Taran is not hospitable and prepared to entertain . The circumstances called for soft , sad , and erotic songs . So he began by teaching his lovely visitors a neo-Celtic love song .  | If you come at all come only at night and walk quietly do n't frighten me . You 'll find the key under the doorstep and me by myself do n't frighten me There 's no pot in the way no stool or can or rope of straw nothing at all . The dog is quiet and wo n't say a word ? it 's no shame to him : ? I 've trained him well My mammy 's asleep and my daddy is coaxing her kissing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Have pity on me lying here by myself ? in the feather bed . Then he asked them to teach him their songs . There were some embarrassed giggles , but as the la-ir was consumed , they became bolder . Their songs were much more explicit than his . And these were the same women who would have been shocked a few days earlier by his mildly bawdy ballad about the winning of Marjetta . Whoever conceived the system of carnival orgies fol- lowed by long months of repression had given considerable thought to the conditioning techniques necessary for the change from a sexless existence to madcap Festivals . There was a certain logic to the system , once you admitted the basic premise that sex interfered with responsible human living . Concentrate it all in two bashes every year , enough for reproduction ( more than enough , considering the antichildren bias of the planet ) and for sexual release , and sedate citizens mentally and physically to repress it the rest of the time . Logical system , but mad premise  --  not completely unknown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity , for that matter . The temperature in the tent rose ; his guests were crowding him , their faces and bodies close to his . Sammy rested her head on his chest . He hurriedly started to sing something comic . She put her hand over his mouth and laughed softly . The other two women were watching avidly . Sammy began to stroke his face with the tips of her fingers . Her eyes were round and large , her figure passive , available , inviting . With the three lovely bodies gleaming with sweat and pressing against him , O'Neill felt himself drifting slowly back toward a primal unity with all things fertile and creative . He was being absorbed by the strong , overpowering power of the loving Earth Mother . He had wanted her from the first moment he had seen her , and now this superb creature was forcing herself on him . He did n't want to break his Rules or hers . He summoned every bit of selfdiscipline he 'd learned during the pilgrimage and pulled back , with a playful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She eased away from him , disappointed and hurt . Her friends sighed subaudibly . They had come to watch the show . After more singing and storytelling , most of it dispirited , Sammy and her companions excused themselves to swim back across the River to prepare for another day 's work . They returned twice more , each time he entertained them  | with ballads , though he avoided the more erotic ones . Their behavior was more restrained . Sammy seemed hurt but still friendly . He was relieved when on the night before the end of the harvest the women did not come . Well , I survived that , the Lord be praised . His gratitude to the Deity was premature . Just before dawn he was suddenly awakened by a powerful incense odor . As he struggled awake , he saw Sammy standing above him , naked , available , vulnerable . Coquetry had been replaced by frank and anxious invitation : Please love me before we both die . She had banked the tent in flowers , lighted an incense capsule , and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and placed a wreath of similar flowers on his head . " I am yours , Geemie , for whatever you want to do with me . You have always wanted me and I have always wanted you . Since the first day . Let us exchange the gift now while we still have time . " Seamus gulped . This was no blushing , energetic but untried youthful virgin . This was an experienced , mature , extremely desirable woman . He 'd never made love to such a one , despite all his fantasies . Why not ? Well , there are a thousand reasons , the first two of which are Margie and Ernie . Neither one of them would ever have to know . " You hesitate ? " she seemed ready to weep . " But it is not wrong . In two more days I am soon to be the play object of every heavy-handed smelly man who wants me . Why not give myself first to a man who loves me ? My Good Mate would not mind . He prefers that I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't think I would do it , does he , Sammy ? " O'Neill groaned and clenched his fists . " I le did not say that he would disapprove . Surely just  | once ... we will soon die , all of us , you know that . Then there will be nothing . " " Of that I 'm not so sure , but even then ... " He turned away from her flesh , all the more appealing because of the gentle marks of age on it . " Marjetta is no longer a maiden . We all know that . She too will be taken by others . It is our way . She will not blame you . " She might and she might not blame me . But she is n't going to be taken by others , not If I can help it . " I 'd blame myself . " He stood up , walked to the other side of the tent , and put on his robe . " I do n't think your culture would approve . Maybe it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Sammy , I know mine would n't . " Damn , why do I have to sound so priggish ? " But the point is that if we do it now and we survive this Festival , we 'll never be able to be friends again . You know it and I know it . I 'd rather have you as a friend in years to come than a lover for a few minutes . " " You do n't love me , Geemie . " Sad , quiet tears were streaming down her cheeks . " You have never loved me . " " I do love you , " he said miserably , trying vainly to sort out the demands of both cultures and of his own heart . " It was the day you kissed me in the Body Institute that I rushed home to tell my mate that I was ready now to ignore the rules . He was so happy . " She covered herself with her hands , now shy and awkward . Hastily Seamus found a thin blanket to drape around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't love me . " " It 's because I do love you that I am saying no . " And because you 're a damn fool , you moralistic idjit . You 'll never have a chance like this again . She collapsed into his arms , now a chaste and exhausted child . Seamus crooned a lullaby so that she might sleep for a little while .  | She 's the blackberry flower , the fine raspberry flower , she 's the plant of best breeding ? your eyes could behold : she 's my darling and dear , my fresh apple-tree flower she is Summer in the cold ? between Christmas and Easter . He was about to waken her and send her back to the harvest work when the police arrived
