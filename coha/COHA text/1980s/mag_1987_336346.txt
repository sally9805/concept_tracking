United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar arrived in Tehran on the first leg of a difficult mission : to negotiate a cease-fire in the seven- year war between Iran and Iraq . The two sides had been expected to stop fighting at least until the Secretary-General 's visit ends this week . But after only a three-day lull , Iraqi warplanes attacked Iranian cities and industrial sites in what Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called a " day of revenge " for Iranian missile attacks on Kuwaiti targets the week before . Iran , meanwhile , said it could not " take the risk " of observing an unconditional cease-fire , as called for by a U.N . Security Council resolution two months ago . If Perez de Cuellar 's mission fails , the next step will be a U.S. campaign for an international arms embargo against Iran .
