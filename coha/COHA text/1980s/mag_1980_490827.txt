THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE movement of Soviet troops into Afghanistan will produce considerable harmony in the for-eign-policy rhetoric of our political campaign . That means that the rhetoric will avoid the question so directly posed by this latest blow to prospects for somewhat less irrational and unstable political relations between East and Wrest . The question is , What is our policy toward our adversary ? The measures announced by the President constitute , in the main , reprisal  --  justifiable reprisal  --  rather than policy . There is under way a reflexive acceptance of some dubious but far-reaching propositions  --  especially of the notion that this deplorable action by the Russians points up the futility of trying to take self-limiting steps in tandem with them , as in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks . Some are saying that even if the Senate had by now approved SALT the Russians would nonetheless have lodged themselves in Afghanistan , since doing so might have been the only way to avoid dislodgment of a Marxist government in Kabul . There may be truth in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and is , a misguided venture is to confuse one thing , Soviet behavior in the so-called Third World , with another , the continuing and deep interest of this country and its allies in reaching a SALT II agreement and in sustaining the SALT process . Recent shocks such as the seizure of American citizens as hostages in Teheran and , now , the Afghanistan affair are the more upsetting for being so intractable  --  cut off from our ability to affect them . Thus , the pressure builds here to take action for its own sake : to do something , whatever that might he , to secure the release of the hostages ; or to respond to the situation in Afghanistan by setting aside the SALT II treaty , as the President has done . But before it is agreed on all sides that the SALT agreement was , as many people in Washington like to say , overtaken by events , we had better think about where the simple act of discarding it  --  a deceptively simple one in the circumstances  --  will lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back into the environment of the Cold War . There may be little , if anything , other than SALT which can check the decline in the relationship between the nuclear superpowers  --  a trend that has been under way for about five years , reversing an earlier trend . Starting in the 1962-63 period , we had been moving in small steps , and with occasional setbacks , away from the harshest aspects of the Cold War . That was the time of the Cuban missile trauma , which was followed by  --  and which doubtless contributed to  --  the limited-test-ban treaty and some easing of the Berlin situation . It was also a time in which the United States had an overwhelming advantage in nuclear weapons . There is no longer any such American advantage . So we confront the prospect of a renewal of the Cold War in an era of nuclear parity and with the possibility , in addition , of an unprecedented competition in Europe in the area of modern nuclear weapons . It is an unattractive  --  indeed , a strikingly dangerous  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were trying to do : narrow the risk of nuclear war by using SALT to restrain the competition in strategic arms and so reducing uncertainties and stabilizing the nuclear balance . We in this country may he prepared to take our chances with the riskier alternative , but our European allies may in most , or all , cases he far less prepared to maintain that course , particularly in view of NATO 'S recent decision to deploy intermediate-range American missiles  --  a new generation of longer-range Pershing missiles , and even longer-range cruise missiles  --  in Continental Europe . Most of the governments concerned with that decision were explicitly relying on SALT II to impose limits on these kinds of weapons American and Russian  --  before matters got out of hand . Now those governments must consider the unavoidably destabilizing consequences that would flow from an unconstrained nuclear-arms buildup in Europe itself , where the distances between adversary blocs are shorter than the distance between America and Russia , and the political tinder is historically drier . It is just as true now as it was before Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been insisting , that NATO upgrade its defenses , nuclear and non-nuclear , Allied governments will require domestic support for those efforts ; some combination of arms control and movement away from East-West confrontation has been judged by all Allied governments to he essential to securing the political underpinning for more defense . Probably the largest risks are faced by West Germany , which is at the leading edge of the confrontation . We have no more important relationship than the one with that country ; nor , probably , has the Soviet Union , its adversary , which regards the Germans as a long-term threat and responds viscerally to whatever they do . The collapse of SALT and of the remnants of detente places Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , the ablest of the Western European leaders , in an extremely awkward position at a time when he , too , is entering a national political campaign . Among the other effects is a perception by much of the world of deepening danger and instability , which , in turn , will adversely affect the already strained system whereby we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic community sort out our monetary and commercial arrangements as well as our joint defenses . A major new cycle in the strategic-arms competition , combined with predictably greater efforts of the kind in Europe , will be inflationary . Moreover , any such trend is likely to be accompanied by the unrelated but continuing turmoil in the Persian Gulf and by oil prices pegged at relentlessly ' inflationary levels . Persistent inflation of the kind we have now is itself a source of political instability : potentially ruinous to the health of any society and capable of inflaming relations between societies that , for important reasons , normally rely on one another . The latest Soviet move is inherently destabilizing and will send ripples throughout Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent ; its exact consequences can not be predicted . However , the implications of Afghanistan 's plight should not he permitted to generate other problems , of a possibly longer-lasting and even more serious nature . Some argue that shelving SALT II will not necessarily produce an end to the process but , rather , an intermission , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate with the Soviet Union on matters important to our security . It is a fact that the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 forced the Johnson Administration to cancel arrangements to start SALT a month later in Moscow . But , of course , a new Administration got matters back on track , and SALT began in November , 1969 . Hence , the current discus sion will raise the question of whether , after the dust has settled next November , Mr. Carter or a successor will or will not decide that as a matter of supreme national interest we should again seek to curb the arms competition and also avoid the risks of extending it to Europe . But the question may not he relevant either then or at any time M the foreseeable future . We may discover a difference between 1969 and 1981 ? the difference between inaugurating a process in which both sides had an awakening interest and resuming a process that one side may have written off as nonproductive . The Russians thought that they had made a SALT II deal with President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1974 . But it never came to anything . And they must have assumed that the SALT II treaty signed by Presidents Carter and Brezhnev last June would by now have taken effect or have been close to that stage . Briefly , the Soviet leadership may prove to be unwilling  --  or , conceivably , unable , for its own internal political reasons  --  to go along in 1981 with the formalization of the SALT II treaty or with a resumption of the SALT negotiating process , or both . By then , the limits imposed by the SALT I interim agreement , which has expired , but which both sides have been informally abiding by , may have been exceeded by the Russians , whose military establishment may also have set in motion projects that will go beyond the restrictions contained in the SALT II treaty . For all these reasons , JANUARY 21 , 19 8 0 and perhaps others , we have entered an exceptionally dangerous period . Outrage at Soviet behavior , fortified by the view that the Soviets can be counted on to behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to develop a response to that behavior or to take critically important decisions . Such decisions , along with the response , need to be based on a rational assessment of our interests , as distinct from a declared intention to sally forth into an action-reaction cycle . Essentially the same hardheaded assessment of our interests has been made by the past four Administrations  --  two Republican and two Democratic  --  and has been supported by the larger part of our society . Mr. Carter , in his letter of January 3rd asking Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd to delay consideration of the SALT treaty , suggested waiting until he and Congress could " assess Soviet actions and intentions . " The reference to Soviet intentions will haunt Mr. Carter if he should ever return to SALT  --  a process whose critics have always said that it must founder on Russian untrustworthiness , but one that actually does not rely on trust or benign intentions , and went forward as much because of our adversary relationship with the Soviet Union as in spite of it . If we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our principal adversary , we require at a minimum some sense of what that shift represents  --  what , if anything , we shall have in the way of a sensible alternative . It is hard to imagine that we will return to the simpler policy of the nineteen-fifties and early sixties , when we simply built bulwarks ( occasionally , as it turned out , on the sands of weak and unreliable governments ) with which to contain the Soviets and rhetorically roll them back . We may , if we can , decide to provide the Afghan resistance forces with weapons  --  a step that would appear to be more relevant to the situation than restrictions on movements of grain and technology , but one that is probably limited by practical Jiff-kit/ties . In the larger policy sense , probably there is no sensible alternative to what , with varying degrees of consistency , we 've been trying to do over the past ten years . ? ? Repertory THE Brooklyn Academy of Music is about to launch its first season of repertory theatre , and since repertory theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been attracting a good THE NEW YORKER deal of attention . The other day , the entire BAM Theatre Company got together for the first time , and we went out to BANS to observe the proceedings . It was a cold winter morning , and the members of the company  --  which totals thirty-two actors and actresses , five directors , eight designers , and about a dozen staff rn mbers  --  assembled in the large room on the building 's third floor known as the Lepercq Space , which is generally used for things like experimental theatre , music , and dance , and which this morning was equipped with a couple of hundred folding chairs and looked like an auditorium . The artistic director of the new company is David Jones , who has been for fourteen years an associate director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and has also been the producer of the BBC 's " Play of the Month " series . His work was seen here in 1975 , when his productions of " Love 's Labour 's Lost " and Maxim Gorky 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's engagement at BAM . Jones is a tall , imposing-looking man of forty-five with a long face , its length accentuated by a high forehead , and he was wearing a navy turtleneck , bluejeans , and brown shoes . While the other members of the company strolled about , talking to each other , we talked to Jones . He told us that the associate director of the company is Arthur Penn , and that the other directors are Edward Cornell , Andre Ernotte , and Emily Mann , He went on to explain that he had been willing to give up many of his commitments in England  --  he will remain a director of the Royal Shakespeare Company , though  --  because he found the idea of establishing a permanent repertory company in New York both important and challenging . " We feel very strongly that this is the right thing to do at this time , " he said . " What we 're trying to do is fill a scandalous gap in New York City . If you go to any other major city and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you 'll almost certainly get an answer . That is n't the case here , and that 's the gap we want to fill . And by repertory company , ' of course , we mean a company of people who work together for a long period of time on a continuing basis  --  not a semipermanent group whose star performers come and go with each production . " Over the past few months , Jones has been travelling around the United States and Canada observing and interviewing about four hundred people . In deciding on his thirty-two actors , he told us , he had to consider such factors as their training and previous experience , their ability to play a great variety of roles , their age and appearance , the likelihood of their fitting in with the other performers , and their willingness to become part of a resident company  --  since many actors who might otherwise have been selected did not want to tie themselves down . When most of the company had taken seats ( a few people remained standing , looking rather happily nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room 's high windows and said , " Let me reassure the actors that at no point today will you he required to speak in other than your own voices  --  no words of William Shakespeare . This is a day to ask and answer questions , a day when we can get to know each other . There will also he measurements for the actors , and we 'll take some group photographs , since this may be the last time we 'll all be together in the same room . I see that Harvey Lichtenstein is over there  --  the Academy 's president . Would you raise your hand , Harvey ? Harvey and Arthur Penn and everyone else involved in this venture have had the nerve  --  dare I say the vision ? to put this show on the road . And the opportunities for all of us are enormous . In terms of broadening ourselves , the advantages of playing in repertory are almost incalculable . But it 's not going to be a bed of roses . Before the season starts , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be rehearsing five hours a day . Each season , we expect to do one Shakespeare play , one European classic , and at least one American classic . And we 're going to do them all with a sense of adventure , a sense of excitement , a sense of humanity , and a sense of humor . " A woman raised her hand to ask how the staff had arrived at its choice of plays for the first season , and Jones smiled and said , " I believe , like Brecht , that the only proper approach to a serious subject is one of disrespect . And I do not believe in museum pieces . That 's why , whereas we might have chosen something like ' The Man Who Came to Dinner ' for our first season , we chose instead Charles MacArthur 's Johnny on a Spot ' ? a play , about Southern politics , that ran on Broadway for only four performances , in 1942 . Rachel Crothers " He and She , ' which dates from 1911 , deals with women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of Shakespeare 's best-known works . And , as for Gorky 's Barbarians , ' we will he giving it its American premiere . The great advantage of putting on an unknown play , you see , is that nobody knows how it 's going to end . " Dairy THE modest gabled structure  --  looking like a cross between an abandoned wayside inn and a disused country church  --  that stands about a hundred yards west of the Central Park Zoo has for years been a rather mysterious landmark for strollers in the Park , who have seldom known what it was or what its function might be . The structure is called the Dairy , and it opened in 1870 as a place where children and adults could obtain fresh milk and other light refreshments . ( A cow or two used to be kept outside in order to suggest rusticity , but most of the milk was brought in from real dairies . ) The Dairy 's role as a refreshment center ended in the early part of this century , and in the nineteen-thirties the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warehouse for Parks Department equipment . In 1973 , plans for its restoration got under way ; last summer , a four-and-ahalf-month renovation project fi-nanced by the Central Park Community Fund with contributions from Revlon , Inc. , Avon Products , the Sheldon Solow Foundation , and others  --  was begun ; and now the Dairy has reopened , as a visitors ' information center , which will serve as a starting point for tours and as a distribution point for maps , brochures , and other material relating to the Park The renovated building 's dedication day turned out to he bright and chilly . Alongside the entrance , which faces south , a large yellowand-white tent had been erected , and at each end of this was a sign reading " WELCOME TO THE DAIRY . " People began gathering before noon , and at about twelve-thirty Mayor Koch turned up , petted a couple of calves that were tethered outside , accepted an old-fashioned bottle of milk from a young woman costumed as a milkmaid , unveiled a plaque , and left . Soon afterward , ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred other people to listen to speeches by a number of dignitaries , including Alexander W. Allport , the executive director of the Central Park Community Fund ; Elizabeth Barlow , the Central Park Administrator ; Michel Berg erac , the chairman of Revlon , Inc. ; and Algernon D. Black , the leader emeritus of the Ethical Culture Society . During the speeches , we had a chance to observe the restored interior . The original Dairy was designed by Calvert Vaux , who , together with Frederick Law Olmsted , designed and laid out Central Park . Its first decor is said to have been attractive  --  few illustrations of it exist  --  but during the building 's years as a warehouse a wooden mezzanine was put up and the whole thing became a dreary-looking storage area for things like shovels , rakes , brooms , wheelbarrows , bathing suits , towels , basketballs , Monopoly boards , and croquet mallets . Now  --  after the realization of a design originated by the architect James Lamantia and elaborated and carried out by the firm of Weisberg , Castro Associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mezzanine has been removed and the building 's original elegant proportions reestablished . The main room , where the speechmaking was going on , is fifty-nine feet long and twenty-one feet wide , and it has a vaulted ceiling that rises to twenty feet . The walls are mostly beige , but there are reds , grays , and browns in some simple Gothic detailwork on the ceiling , the wainscoting , and the window frames . Against the north wall are two large oval photographs , in sepia tones , of Olmsted ( bearded and benign-looking ) and Vaux ( bearded and pensive-looking ) . A smaller room , also mostly beige , opens off the north side of the main room , and there a slide show having to do with the history of Central Park will he presented every half hour between 11 A.M. and 3:30 P.m . After the speeches were over , we ran into Parks Commissioner Gordon J. Davis , who was looking sporty in a brown tweed jacket and yellow corduroy trousers , and was wearing a lapel button that read " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the restoration project had cost two hundred thousand dollars so far , and that a loggia that formerly extended along the building 's south fa  --  ade would he rebuilt next year . He added that a number of other restoration projects were being under-taken for Central Park  --  including work on the Belvedere , the Bethesda Fountain , the fountain on Cherry Hill , a cast-iron bridge northwest of the Reservoir and a cast-iron bridge on its southwest side , and the Maine Monu-ment  --  with funds from both private and governmental sources . We also spoke with Mr. Allport , who was wearing a gray plaid suit and a lapel button that read " WELCOME , I 'M SANDY . " Ile said he believed that it would not be long before people became familiar with the fact that they could come to the Dairy in order to take tours  --  historical , botanical , and so forth  --  which were already being conducted in the Park by the recently organized New York City Urban Park Rangers . Wine , cheese , crackers , and peanuts were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east end of the main room , four young people known as the Thalia String Quartet began to play Mozart . Later , when we left the building , we found a man in an Army jacket holding the ropes tied to the necks of the two calves  --  a Jersey and a Guernsey  --  that Mayor Koch had petted earlier that day . The man told us that his name was Jim Martyn and that the calves belonged to the company he worked for , Interboro Pony Rides . " Most of the time , Elsie and Daisy are on loan to the Children 's Zoo , but today we were asked to bring them over here , " he said . " I guess they 're pretty good at lending atmosphere . " He smiled , and led the calves away . Island Report AN acquaintance of ours has a daughter who has spent the last couple of years working as a mason on Cape Cod with her friend Jim . Two months ago , they decided to avoid another desolate winter on the Cape by seeking work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , our friend received this report from the Virgin Islands : Jim got a job working for a big contractor , and , after a difficult week , we finally found cheap housing . We are living in a trailer near the top of one of the highest mountains , with a panoramic view of the distant sea . The trailer sits in a slimy swamp made by water coming down the mountain ; it 's been raining torrents for about a week . The place is a jungle . ( When I said tropics , I did n't mean TROPICS . ) There are two abandoned greenhouses  --  with the glass missing  --  about fifteen yards from our trailer , filled with old orchid plants ( no blooms ) , They are very ugly , with tuberous roots that crawl like snakes all over the pots . The greenhouses are now made entirely of iron mesh , so it rains through the roofs , and there is plenty of heat naturally . It reminds me of " The Big Sleep " ? that crotchety old man sweating in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago we were a unified nation that had closed ranks and was speaking with one voice . " ? ? room , with Bogart admiring his orchids , his death plants . Fancy fungus , I call them . The first time I looked in , I was excited , because I saw palm fans five feet tall and flowering vines , and I thought I could make our trailer living room beautiful with tree-height plants . Then I discovered that all those plants were actually growing in tangles up through the dirt floor . Our laundry line is strung between one greenhouse and a tree clump that is like a jade tree grown to enormous proportions , with leaves a foot long . It grows over a foot a day . I think it 's coming for us . Plant life here takes on a sinister aspect . This " tree " is fifteen feet high and it is growing out of four small tin pots . Where are the roots ? To get to the laundry line , I wade through the muck , checking for slugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wade back ; tiptoe over our lemon-yellow wall-to-wall mildewed rug to the sink , where I wash my feet off , if there 's any water ; and trot back to our couch ( it is covered with a Woolworth 's sheet to stern the tide of " nosee-ums , " tiny , almost invisible bugs that bite you hard , but you do n't know it till later ) . By 8 A.M. , it is boiling hot , and a paralyzing lethargy creeps over you . It takes an hour to do a ten-minute chore . When we moved in , the trailer had been unoccupied for a year . Down here , the animals and the elements take over the minute you leave . There was a lizard looking down from a curtain rod , another lizard climbing up the wall , and one on each of the window screens . A rat was on the outside ledge of the bathroom window ; his eyes  --  bright and beady  --  were level with mine . I proceeded into the bedroom and found that the window shelf was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost incandescent-looking , with large suction-cup feet . We have windows that crank open in sections of glass , and the frogs press themselves against the nearly horizontal surfaces when the windows are open , using them for a sundeck . The frogs glow red when bright light shines through them . At night , there is often a sudden huge noise and a great blue-white flash on the power-line pole outside , and we lose electricity . Then we sit around by candlelight , which makes you paranoid in a place like this . We get our water from a pump higher up the mountain , except every day we lose the prime , so we do n't have any . Re-priming involves a long hike up the mountain to turn on a pump at some guy 's house . This takes place at dusk , when Jim gets home  --  usually in the pouring rain . It 's a two-man operation . I have to stand ready to turn on various pipes when Jim gives the signal from above . As the darkness closes in , Jim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm standing in slime and guinea grass ( local coarse grass that grows as high as six feet and houses every sort of biting insect ) , and when I turn on the water next to the trailer it usually dies , because of air in the line . I yell to Jim , but I ca n't be heard over the rain , and anyway he 's yelling directions to me at the same time . Tempers shorten in direct proportion to the rate of loss of visibility . If the water does n't die , I have to quickly wade over to another faucet , clapping my hands loudly and saying , " All right , boys let 's clear it out ! " ( I am speaking to the rats , lizards , etc. , in the vicinity . ) The water 's ON : We quickly take showers , flush the toilet , wash dishes , do laundry . By morning , we have no water again , and at 5:30 P.M. we start the whole process once more . There is a frog sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . I have begun to talk to the lizards  --  a grudging acceptance . Anyway , do n't think things are terrible . It all evens out . N.Ve just need to get settled .
