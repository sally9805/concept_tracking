Sadat plays Europe <P> He is anathema in much of the Arab world for his dealings with Israel , but there are still plenty of places where Anwar Sadat is considered something of a model statesman . Last week the Egyptian President went to Western Europe and came away with bravos ringing in his ears . He was given a standing ovation by the European Parliament , then a red carpet reception by French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing . <P> Sadat had been invited to address the European Parliament in Luxembourg . With customary acumen , he seized the occasion to endorse a Middle East peace initiative the European leaders had agreed upon at their summit in Venice last June . But it was a qualified endorsement ; he emphasized that the European effort should supplement rather than supplant the Camp David peace accords between Egypt and Israel . When an Italian Communist deputy held up a placard reading NO TO CAMP DAVID ! Sadat departed from his text to say , with a smile , " I have not come here to sell Camp David . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it " uniquely qualified to play a prominent role " in the peace process . Noting that a Palestinian entity would pose " no threat to the security of Israel " because it would be too preoccupied " with the task of reconstruction and building bridges with other nations , " he urged the Europeans to help persuade both Israel and the Palestinians to work toward " mutual recognition . " He also invited the Europeans to consider " security guarantees " for an eventual settlement ; one possibility that the Europeans themselves have discussed is the dispatch of peacekeeping troops . <P> Once again , Sadat came out forcefully against the inclusion of Jordan in any resumption of Palestinian autonomy talks . And though the Venice declaration called for the " association " of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Middle East negotiations , Sadat pointedly omit ted any mention of the P.L.O. , a possible signal to the Europeans not to insist on P.L.O . involvement , at least not until a later stage . <P> Sadat , accompanied by his wife Jehan , next flew to Paris for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French capital . Instead , it had all the makings of a state affair . Accompanied by his wife Anne-Aymone , the protocol-conscious Giscard broke with custom by meeting the Sadats at the airport ( something he never does unless it is an official state visit ) , escorted them on a leisurely tour of the city , then hosted a lunch at the Elysee Palace . Afterward , Giscard and Sadat spent two hours talking privately . <P> The warm Gallic welcome ended several years of frostiness between Paris and Cairo and demonstrated a recent shift in the French diplomatic posture with regard to the Middle East . Giscard has been burned by Libya , whose Colonel Muammar Gaddafi recently made a power grab in the former French African colony of Chad . As a result , he has been discreetly backing away from his formerly enthusiastic support for radical Arab regimes . <P> With the French elections only three months off , he seems also to be trying to avert criticism that his oil-comes-first foreign policies have not paid off .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
