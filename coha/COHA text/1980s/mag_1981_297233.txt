AMERICAN GENESIS by Jeffrey Goodman Summit ; 285 pages ; $11.95 <P> Anthropological dogma holds that modern man , ancestor of all people living today , appeared rather suddenly in Europe 35,000 years ago , spread south ward into Africa and eastward into Asia , and finally , no more than 12,000 years ago , crossed the Bering land bridge to America . Now an anthropological heretic offers another theory . Modern man , says Jeffrey Goodman , has actually been in America for at least 50,000 years . He crossed the Bering bridge the other way , bringing his culture to Europe and Asia . <P> " The proverbial Garden of Eden may have been in ... southern California , " writes Goodman in American Genesis . <P> " From this Garden the first fully modern men may have ventured forth bearing cultural and technological gifts to the rest of the world . " <P> The author , who holds a doctorate in anthropology and degrees in both geological engineering and archaeology , ad vances his thesis with layman 's language and expert 's knowledge . Citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he offers evidence that toolmaking men resided in the Americas more than 38,000 years ago , points out similarities between the shamanistic cul ture of the Cro-Magnons and that of the American Indians and provides convincing arguments that the prehistoric migration could just as easily have gone from the Americas as come to them . Few of Goodman 's colleagues will subscribe to his theory ; many still find his evidence in complete . Fewer still will be able simply to dismiss it . <P> <P> A MAN by Oriana Fallaci <P> Translated by William Weaver <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 463 pages ; $14.95 <P> Fifty years ago , Critic D.B. Wyndham Lewis compiled an anthology of hilariously ( and unintentionally ) bad verse entitled The Stuffed Owl . Today an enterprising editor could produce a companion Owl stuffed with bad prose . High on the list should be selections from Oriana Fallaci 's nonfiction novel A Man . The title is the last instance of unmannered writing to be encountered until the reader emerges at the other end , covered with tropes.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
