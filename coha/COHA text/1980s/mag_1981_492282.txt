SOLZHENITSYN : HIS COURAGE WITH CANCER by William A. Knaus , M.D. lir he first Russian-language edi- tion of The Gulag Archipelago I was published in Paris in December 1973 . A few months later , while I was living in Kishinev , I secretly obtained a copy through the State Department diplomatic pouch . Carefully wrapping it in a recent issue of Prauda and concealing it in my setka ( shopping bag ) along with a loaf of bread and some rolls , I took it to the apartment of an old physician with whom I had become close friends . I knew that of all the gifts I could bring him , this book would be the most appreciated . As my friend removed the layers of newspaper and saw the gray cover with red-lettered title , his hands began to shake . When it was clear it really was the Gulag , he shut his eyes and brought it to his lips . His wife , sitting on the other side of the room , stood up as if a fourth person had entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , had just been expelled from the Soviet Union . Today the 62-year-old Nobel Prize-winning writer lives in the United States in a tightly fenced country house near Cavendish , Vermont . The three volumes of his largest work , The Gulag Archipelago , are now complete . Much of its 1,800 pages are documentation , providing names and histories for a few of the 20 million people who died in Stalin 's vast system of prison camps . Despite its length there is a raging will throughout , a defiance of fatigue in the face of overwhelming suffering . The book is Solzhenitsyn 's tribute to the strength and limitless resilience of the human mind . Its completionwas a major accomplishment , one which would satisfy most men . But after writing The Gulag , three major novels ( The First Circle , Cancer Ward and August 1914 ) and numerous short stories and plays , Aleksandr Isaevich Solzhenitsyn is still a man obsessed with work . He is now finishing his long-awaited account of the February 1917 Revolution . He is arranging the publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times he works in a barren one-room cabin isolated by thick woods from the main house . His tastes in food are simple . He avoids beef and refuses to eat any smoked or dried fish . Fresh vegetables , dark bread , a bowl of soup and fruit are enough . His favorite dish is a single , peeled , boiled potato . His stomach fills quickly , and he seldom asks for seconds . If we are what we eat , then Aleksandr Isaevich Solzhenitsyn is , like his writing , pure . But what else is there about this man that enables or indeed forces him on ? Why , after so much success , does he still struggle against a constantly elusive deadline ? The details of Solzhenitsyn 's early life , his education and his imprisonment at age 26 are well documented . He was raised in Rostov . His father died in a hunting accident six months before he was born . As a child he was constantly catching cold . He never enjoyed good health and avoided physical sports . After graduating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a prepodouatel ( high school instructor ) , teaching physics and mathematics . The position was short-lived . Within four months , on October 18 , 1941 , he was drafted into the Red Army . Initially , because of his poor health , he drove trucks . Within three years , however , by drawing on his mathematical background and a year of artillery training , Private Solzhenitsyn was promoted to captain . He took command of an artillery battery and fought in the famous armored conflict at Kursk-Orgol . Throughout the fighting , Artillery Captain Solzhenitsyn maintained a dream of someday becoming a writer . He outlined short stories on the back of battle plans . He wrote long and detailed letters to friends and former schoolmates . According to Solzhenitsyn , it was story outlines found by members of the NKVD 's ( secret police ) counterespionage section SMERSH ( Smert Shpionam , Death to Spies ) in his map case that led to his arrest in February 1945 . For the crime of referring to Stalin as " the moustached one , " along with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at forced labor plus three years in exile . One of his first prison assignments was a construction project in Moscow . Then , just as it had in the army , his mathematical background improved his position , and Zek ( prisoner ) Solzhenitsyn was reassigned to a scientific institute at Marfino . From Marfino prison , Solzhenitsyn went to Ekibastuz , a large labor camp in Eastern Kazakhstan which he described as " the lowest circle of hell . " It was while imprisoned at Ekibastuz that Solzhenitsyn 's health , never robust , first became a major influence in his life and his writing . But unlike much of Solzhenitsyn 's public life , the details of his very private fight against death are a mixture of partial fact , rumor and speculation . It is widely known , for example , that in the early 1950s Solzhenitsyn 's body developed cancer . The emphasis on body is important because , except for a few months at the end of 1953 , at no time did his mind acknowledge the malignancy . It is also known that Solzhenitsyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel Kostoglotov , the character who most persons believe represents Solzhenitsyn , is afflicted with a large abdominal tumor and has come to Tashkent for radiation treatment . Solzhenitsyn does not discuss the details of his illness . Today , even his wife and close friends avoid the topic . Solzhenitsyn maintains that details of his private life are not important ; only his work , his writing , matters . Yet many people close to the writer acknowledge that his illness 35 years ago remains the major influence in his writing today . He came very close to death in Tashkent , " one of his close Washington friends told me . ' ' He believes he was saved by a combination of medical treatment and his own stoikost , or determination to survive . If he ever stops working , he 's convinced his cancer will come back , and to continue to live he must write . To him , living and writing are inseparable . " Solzhenitsyn 's medical history begins in January 1952 . It was then he noticed a small swelling in his right groin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of January , however , the lump was the size of a small lemon and growing larger every day . Solzhenitsyn entered the Ekibastuz prison hospital for surgery . On February 12 , a German prisoner-surgeon removed Solzhenitsyn 's tumor , using local anethesia . After the operation , sandbags were placed over his incision to stop bleeding and prevent further swelling . At the time Solzhenitsyn understood little except that the removed lump was a small cancer , a malignant lymph node . The cancer , he was told , had not invaded the surrounding tissues . Because there was no laboratory at the small hospital , sections of Solzhenitsyn 's tumor were sent to the Department of Pathology at the Omsk Medical Institute . A microscopic analysis was necessary to tell what kind of tumor it was and whether further treatment was indicated . Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn recovered quickly . He was discharged from the prison hospital on February 26 , 1953 . In a few weeks the pain of the incision disappeared . He went back to his construction work and later worked as a smelter in the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following Stalin 's death , Solzhenitsyn , along with thousands of other political prisoners , was released from Ekibastuz . As a former " political , " however , Solzhenitsyn was still not free to live and travel as he wished . He was forced into exile in the Uzbek village of Kok-Terek . In September he developed stomach pains . He lost his appetite . His weight , always precariously low , began to fall . At first Solzhenitsyn thought his problem might be from gastritis or a stomach ulcer . While in prison he had complained bitterly about the diet . Watery fish stew , gruel made from boiled grass and sto gram ( 100 grams ) of bread were the daily ration . What little protein there was came in the form of dried , smoked fish . This diet , especially the fish , Solzhenitsyn believed , had poisoned his stomach . For help , he turned to He 's convinced that to continue to live he must write . To him , living and writing are inseparable . Nikolai Ivanovich Zubov , an older man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in KokTerek . Dr. Zubov urged his friend to write to Ekibastuz and obtain the exact type of his tumor . Although not a specialist in cancer , Zubov was concerned that Solzhenitsyn 's current problems were not gastritis but were related to the operation and his malignant lymph node . Because there were no cancer specialists in Kok-Terek , Solzhenitsyn applied to the local NKVD authorities ( to whom he reported every two weeks under the conditions of his exile ) for permission to go to Dzhambul , the closest town with specialized medical facilities . At Dzhambul , a stomach x-ray found not an ulcer but a tumor mass the size of a large fist . The mass was outside Solzhenitsyn 's stomach , growing up from the back of his abdominal wall , pushing his stomach up and out . It was almost certainly cancer . Solzhenitsyn returned to Kok-Terek early December 1953 . Before leaving Dzhambul he had obtained extractfrom a mandrake root plant ( issyk kul ) , a dark , thick liquid that , according to Russian folklore , cured cancer . His symptoms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to the Tashkent Oncological ( Cancer ) Health Center for treatment . But travel to Tashkent required official permission , and when Solzhenitsyn first applied , the local NKVD administrator refused . During the final weeks of 1953 , in constant pain , nauseated every time he tried to eat , living on tea with sugar , " poisoned with cancer , " Solzhenitsyn was convinced he was dying . His belly was swollen with ascites ( fluid from the rapidly growing tumor ) , making it painful to breathe and excruciating to cough . The doctors told Solzhenitsyn he had at most three weeks to live . It was , according to him , the most dreadful moment of his life , " to die on the threshold of freedom , to see all I had written , all that gave meaning to my life thus far , about to perish with me , " he wrote in his literary biography The Oak and the Calf . " I hurriedly copied things out in tiny handwriting , rolled them several pages at a time into tight cylinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle in my garden  --  and set off for Tashkent to meet the new year ( 1954 ) and to die . " Prior to leaving for Tashkent , Solzhenitsyn did write a desperate letter to the Omsk Medical Institute asking for any information they had on his tumor . To his surprise , a reply arrived in a few days . It was a letter from a worker in the pathology laboratory . She wrote that she remembered the day his tissue specimen arrived from Ekibastuz . She even remembered the diagnosis which had been sent . A few days after the letter arrived , Solzhenitsyn received an exit permit for Tashkent , but he hesitated before leaving . Going to Tashkent meant the possibility of more surgery . an alternative Solzhenitsyn refused to accept . Although his body was severely weakened by the tumor , the man who had survived the Gulag and had witnessed the victory of human beings over enormous odds considered doing without traditional medical care . After all , he was taking the issyk kul root . Perhaps his own determination to live would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled to the Tashkent Oncological Health Center . On January 4 , 1954 , he was admitted to Ward 13 for radiation treatment . Lidia Aleksandrovna Dunayeva was chief of the irradiation department . Solzhenitsyn 's treatment began immediately , for Dunayeva was convinced that the mass she could feel " deep down beside his stomach " was a " secondary " or metastasis from his malignant lymph node . Before Solzhenitsyn told her of the diagnosis from Omsk , Dr. Dunayeva had already decided the tumor had not started in that node . It had to be a seminoma , she thought , His cancer started in his testicle and had now spread throughout his abdomen . Seminomas are part of a class of tumors known as germinomas . They get their name from the fact that all members of the class arise from germ cells , the earliest , most primitive parts of our body . During the initial weeks of human development , before the embryo assumes any shape , the germinal cell center forms the beginnings of our nervous and reproductive systems . The rest of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of cancer are a form of revolution against normal biology , it seems ironic that the type to affect Solzhenitsyn , a man who argues for a return to older Russian origins , should be a form of germinoma , a primitive cancer recalling his body 's own origin . It is also unusual because seminoma is a rare form of cancer . Each year it accounts for less than one-half of one percent of all new cases . When it does occur , it most often strikes men 35 to 50 years old . Solzhenitsyn was 33 when he first noticed his tumor . In adult males , seminomas ( from the Latin for seed or semen ) start growing in the testis . In many cases the original tumor may be small , noticed only by a careful examination . Sometimes , as was the situation with Solzhenitsyn , the first evidence of a seminoma is not a lump in the testicle but an enlarged lymph node in the groin . Because Solzhenitsyn 's tumor had already spread at the time of his first operation , he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had immediate x-ray treatment to the testicle along with radiation to the draining lymph nodes . Dr. John G. Maier is a radiotherapist , a doctor who specializes in destruction of cancer cells by radiation . Today he is chairman of the department of radiation oncology at the Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax , Virginia , but for many years Dr. Maier directed radiation treatment at the Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington , D.C. It was while at Walter Reed that he began studying the treatment of seminomas . Over the past two decades he has analyzed more than 1,000 cases of the rare tumor . According to Maier , the standard apCon tinued on page 110 proach used today against seminoma is surgery , removal of the testis along with its spermatic cord . Radiation treatment is then given to all draining lymph nodes . Using this approach , the cure rate , or percentage of persons alive five years after diagnosis , is good  --  over 95 percent . As in other forms of cancer , the later the cancer is detected , the less chance there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tashkent , began radiation treatment on January 5 , 1954 , Solzhenitsyn 's first full day in Ward 13 . A large purple cross was drawn across his stomach . The cross divided his abdomen into four quadrants , each of which would , in a rotating schedule , be bombarded with radiation . During his treatments three heavy rubber mats filled with lead wire were placed over the other quadrants to protect them from receiving too much radiation . Sometimes a thin copper shield was also used to protect Solzhenitsyn 's skin from the effects of the radiation beam . " His treatment program sounds very close to what he would have received in this country at that time , " Maier says . " In the early ' 50s only a few large centers in the United States had the capability to give high voltage or cobalt radiotherapy . " In his novel , Solzhenitsyn records that he received between 12,000 and 18,000 ER ( rads ) during the first course of radiation , " Maier continues . " Those are what we call ' air doses ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today we use the term rad to refer only to the amount actually absorbed by the tumor . This difference is important because a dose of 18,000 rads would have caused serious damage to Sol . zhenitsyn 's stomach and intestines . Intestinal cells can take only 4,000 , perhaps 4,500 rads before they die . " To determine exactly the number of rads Solzhenitsyn 's tumor received , I would have to know how efficient the machine used was , its field size and how thick his abdomen was , " Maier explains . " But estimating on the basis of the equipment available at that time and knowing that he was very sick , emaciated , I 'd guess that he got from2,000 to 3,000 rads to his abdomen along with a smaller dose directed at his testis to treat the primary tumor . " Solzhenitsyn remained in the Tashkent Oncological Center from January 4 , 1954 , until the middle of February . During this month and a half he had about 50 x-ray treatments , each lasting 30 minutes . They had a remarkable effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain decreased , and he gained his first small but important victory . His arms , previously too weak to hold a book , now permitted him hours of uninterrupted reading . Along with radiation , Solzhenitsyn swallowed tablets of sinestrol , a form of estrogen , the major female hormone . Since seminoma is a male tumor , the Soviet doctors at that time thought that large doses of a female hormone might help prevent the rapid growth of the cancer . " We never used estrogens for seminoma in the United States , " Maier comments , " To my knowledge there was never any evidence that the tumor was hormone-related , so I really ca n't explain the use of the drug . Perhaps they knew something we did n't . " Between his other hospitalizations in 1974 , staggered to permit his body time to recover from the side effects of the x-rays , Solzhenitsyn returned to Kok-Terek for a fresh supply of issyk kul . " Solzhenitsyn is a fortunate man , " Maier concludes . " His radiation treatment was delayed , and any number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peritonitis , intestinal perforation or his tumor could have spread so widely that radiation would n't have been effective . And then there was the type of cancer . In 1954 there were only two types of cancer that could be cured by radiation . One was a particular form of lymphoma , the other seminoma . Both are quite rare . " In Solzhenitsyn 's view , his own case history is a striking example of an interdependence of mind and body . In December 1953 he was dying of cancer . He then began writing feverishly , trying to record as much as possible before it became too late . By February the cancer was receding , and suddenly there was a possibility of more time . Of course there was also the radiation therapy and sinestrol treatments . There was even the issyk kul . But above all there was his dedication to writing . That , Solzhenitsyn maintains , is the reason he is alive today . Solzhenitsyn 's victory over cancer also provides him with an analogy he frequently uses in his writing . " Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease afflicting him , " he once wrote . At the same time he was conquering his tumor , Solzhenitsyn believes his country was ridding itself of its malignant dictator , Stalin . Since then , however , Russia and its people have not been dedicated enough in their fight against the " disease of ECommunism " which Solzhenitsyn believes will spread cancer-like " to destroy mankind , or else mankind will have to rid itself of Communism ( and even then face lengthy treatment for secondary tumors ) . " In the writing center he has established in the Vermont countryside , Solzhenitsyn , surrounded by friends , family and the latest in word-processing devices , considers himself self-sufficient . It is the perfect spot from which to wage his campaign against Soviet Communism and to , as he told New York Times art critic Hilton Kramer in a 1980 interview , " race against time . " To the many critics who view Solzhenitsyn 's continuing dream of returning Russia to its former glory as a futile , unrealistic dream , Solzhenitsyn scoffs .
