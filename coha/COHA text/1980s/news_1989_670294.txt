NEW YORK  --  As Japan ' s stock market races to new highs , U.S.-based international investors once again are running for cover . " We ' re cheap-stock oriented , and we can ' t find a cheap stock in Japan , " says Barton Biggs , chairman of Morgan Stanley &; Co. ' s money management unit . Mr. Biggs says he didn ' t expect the latest runup in Tokyo ' s market , but he isn ' t buying . " I wouldn ' t be surprised if this turns out to be the final surge for Tokyo , " he declares . That ' s a familiar refrain among U.S.-based money managers , who have underweighted Japan in their stock portfolios since the early 1980s . The trouble is , the Tokyo market keeps defying the pessimists . At this stage , the Americans have bet so long and so heavily on a Japanese market retreat that they have little choice but to dig in their heels and hope for vindication some day . As of Sept. 30 , the median U.S. money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese stocks , says Christopher Nowakowski , president of Intersec Research Corp . , Stamford , Conn . That ' s drastically below a 62. 9% weighting for Japan in the widely followed Morgan Stanley/Capital International Europe Australia Far East index . That index weights stocks from 18 foreign countries according to their total market value . " It ' s easy for me to say they really blew it , " says Mr. Nowakowski . For the past two years , Japan has been among the best-performing stock markets in the world . But Mr. Nowakowski observes that money managers respond that " as fiduciaries , they have a responsibility not to expose other people ' s money to the risks that the Japanese market involves . " To most U.S. money managers , Japanese stocks look alarmingly overpriced . Japanese stocks sell at an average price of about 68 times their per-share earnings , compared with a mere 12. 3 price-earnings multiple for the broad U.S. stock market . The average dividend yield for stocks in Tokyo is a meager 0. 5% , compared with 3. 7% in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telephone Corp. , has a total market value of $250 billion  --  more than the entire West German stock market . The Tokyo stock market " feels very similar to the U.S. in 1972 , when the ' Nifty Fifty ' growth stocks had one last run before they collapsed , " argues Gary Brinson , president of First Chicago Corp. ' s money management unit . His firm has cut back Japanese stocks to less than 30% of international portfolios . If Japanese stocks rise further , " We might take another whack at that position , " Mr. Brinson says . Morgan Stanley ' s Mr. Biggs limits Japanese stocks to just 20% of his international portfolios . " Ultimately , someday it will be right to be underweighted in Japan , " he says . His firm ' s Tokyo office is bullish on Japanese stocks . But that doesn ' t carry much weight in New York , where Morgan Stanley ' s U.S. market strategist , Byron Wein , continues to warn that a Tokyo collapse could hurt U.S. stocks this year . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Tokyo market decline , " says Nicholas Bratt , managing director of Scudder , Stevens &; Clark . Mr. Bratt regards himself as more willing to look for reasons Tokyo stocks might not be overpriced . Japanese accounting encourages companies to understate their true earnings , for example . And many Japanese companies have valuable assets that aren ' t properly appraised on their books . Says Mr. Bratt : " There has been a simplistic attitude that one could apply the same valuation standards to markets around the world and make them all march to an Anglo-Saxon tune , " he says . " Well , it just isn ' t so . " Scudder , for one , has decided that many small Japanese companies ' stocks are attractive . Still , Scudder has only 25% of its International Fund assets invested in Japan . Given U.S. apprehensions about the Tokyo market ' s next move , Intersec ' s Mr. Nowakowski observes , any money manager thinking of buying Japanese stocks now  --  after the recent big run-up-is faced with " a damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Japanese market are quietly trying to see if they can figure out a new way to value Japanese stocks . Batterymarch Financial Management Corp. , for one , is looking at such off-beat factors as a Japanese company ' s prestige , how many foreign stock exchanges it is listed on , and whether it has big , powerful Japanese shareholders . Such " soft variables " are a big switch for Boston-based Batterymarch , which usually relies on mainstream financial data to select out-of-favor stocks at depressed prices . " But we ' ve been wrestling with models that seem more successful for Japan , " says Richard Gula , a Batterymarch official . This new approach has been spurred by Batterymarch managers ' visits to Tokyo and their increased contact with Japanese market professionals , Mr. Gula adds . In fact , figures released this week in Tokyo show that foreign investors bought 48. 4 billion yen ( $384 million ) more in Japanese stocks than they sold in 1988 . Much of that buying may have come from Europe , rather than the U.S. Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in five years , although on a modest scale . Says Scudder ' s Mr. Bratt : " It ' s a bit embarrassing for the ( money management ) community " to have missed out so extensively on Japan ' s gains the past few years .
