I get a lot of junk mail . Like most of my friends , I throw most of the letters away unopened . I do save the catalogues , however ; I pass them to my wife , who no doubt is one of the mainstays of the $21 billion junk-mail . industry ? " direct mail , " as its practitioners prefer . My wife brings catalogues to bed with her at night . She is also a doctor , and people with causes to advance and gadgets to sell like doctors . For every piece of mail I get , she gets ten . Somewhere , I imagine , a mountain has been deforested just for her . Together , she and I have been rented , matched , merged , purged , " deduped , " stockpiled , downloaded , parsed , and sorted ? by zip , carrier route , carrier walk , and zip-plus-four . ( Next time you see " car-rt-sort " on your bulk-rate mail , know this : Whoever sent it got a postal discount by sorting it by carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zip-code zone . ) We 've been scavenged by data pickers who sifted through our driving records and auto registrations , our deed and our mortgage , in search of what direct mailers see as the keys to our identities : our sexes , ages , the ages of our cars , the equity we hold in our home . The scavengers record this . data in central computers , which , in turn , merge it with other streams of revelatory data collected from other sources ? the types of magazines we subscribe to , the organizations we support , how much credit we 've got left ? and then spit it all out ( for a price ) to virtually anyone who wants it . The information eventually makes its way to the country 's dozen or so largest data banks , electromagnetic colossi maintained by companies that serve the direct-mail industry . I feel so cheap , so used . The direct-mail industry in America has quietly built itself an immense , private intelligence network in which nearly each and every one of us now resides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting to know us even better . Lists are the raw materials . There are " compiled " lists built of records bought wholesale from state governments or built piece by piece by the scavengers . There are " response " lists created wheneverpeople subscribe to magazines , order products through the mail , or answer consumer surveys . Advertisers can rent lists that tell what car you bought , whether you like dried fruit and nuts , whether you have a kid , whether you or your wife is pregnant . Individually , these lists are mostly harmless . So what if strangers know I subscribe to Country Living ? Within the last five years , however , advanced " merge / purge " software has given the data collectors the power to layer list upon list , cheaply and quickly , and thereby ? if they wish ? to turn lean lists into thick dossiers . Suppose my name appears on 100 lists ( a conservative estimate , by the way ) . The data on these lists , if merged , would form a kind of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire personality defined by what I 've registered , signed ? and especially what I 've purchased . Moreover , a recent surge of mergers among data companies and their databases is yielding still richer profiles of consumers . Last summer , for example , R. L. Polk &; Co. , a huge data compiler in Detroit , acquired National Demographics &; Lifestyles of Denver ? a company that , with the help of the brief questionnaires that conic along with the warranty materials in new radios , TVs , and other socalled consumer durables , has built a database listing the hobbies and passions of 20 million American consumers . More disquieting , however , is the entry of TRW and Equifax , the nation 's largest credit bureaus , into direct mail . They provide the mailers with lists derived from credit files ? files previously available only for purposes of evaluating a consumer 's creditworthiness . The number of people now collected and processed is staggering . TRW keeps monthly tabs on 143 million consumers , or roughly 80 percent of all consumers over the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 million households-90 percent of all households in the country . Donnelley enriches this database by mailing marketing surveys to 30 million households at a time , ten times a year . The survey questions can get personal . One example from a recent mailing : " How many times , if any , did you medicate for diarrhea in the past year ? " The keepers of big data say they do it for the consumer 's benefit . But data have a way of being used for purposes other than originally intended . In 1984 ? I mean , really , of all years ? the Selective Service System used a Farrell 's Ice Cream list it had rented to contact young men as they came of draft age . ( The list was made up of the names of children who , in registering for an ice-cream promotion , had written down their birth dates . ) Also in 1984 , the IRS tried using mailing lists to track down tax evaders . It approached Donnelley Marketing and two other data giants , but they refused , arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRS official , however , told me one loyal American list broker , Dunhill of Washington , did supply the names and whereabouts of 2 million people . ) Could darker scenarios develop ? Or could I just be paranoid ? Did you know that advertisers can rent lists of names of men who are gay ? That there are lists that single out blacks and Hispanics ? And what is your first reaction when I tell you that A.B . Data Ltd. , in Milwaukee , specializes in collecting the names of Jews ? Two or three times a year it runs the entire popula tion through a program it devised that selects the surnames of people statistically most likely to be Jews . Anyone named Aaroni has a 100 percent chance of being Jewish ; anyone named Ronald Reagan , only a 1 percent chance . A.B . does a brisk commerce in Jewish names . Avram Lyon , A.B . ' s vice president , noted when I spoke with him that Jews read books ; have tended to be generous to charitable causes ; and , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have a lot of disposable cash . " I asked if A.B . had ever received inquiries from fundamentalist types bent on direct-mail evangelism . Yes , Lyon said , there had been inquiries , but the company turned them down . My uneasiness about the magnitude of information collected by direct mailers led me to this question : Who wants me ? On whose lists do I reside ? I set out recently to find out , to collect the tiles of my personal mosaic from far-flung computers , trace my direct mail to its sources , have myself profiled , mapped , and clustered . Just who ? out there , in the universe of direct mail ? do they think I am ? Ibegan the search for my direct- " It 's all public information , " Carol Stewart assured me .

But there it all was , right on the screen of Stewart 's microfiche viewer : 3320 Sequoia Avenue , zip 21215 . Owner-occupied . Single-family dwelling . Acquired November 1983 for $125,000 , with a 5112,500 mortgage from Yorkridge-Calvert Savings and Loan . He pays $3,553.36 in annual state and local property taxes . My heart leapt . I asked to see the records on my own home , and these too appeared . Of far more interest to me , however , were the adjacent entries , the homes of my neighbors . Ah , Richard and Carol , Fred and Betsy , Nancy , Margaret ! I know a few things you do n't know I know . Seeing my name there , toiling in its own small way to help Lusk make a profit , gave me an odd feeling . My affairs were being monitored , yet knew nothing about it . Who else was watching ? That afternoon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have on me.1 was steered to Ed Seidel , a public-information officer who was happy to be of help , and who is himself fed up with the amount of information one has to give up these days . ( When paying with a credit card , he wo n't give out his phone number ! ) The state keeps two " headers " on me , he said : one containing my registration and title information , the other my license and driving record . Both are available to anyone who wants to see them , and both are collected routinely in national sweeps by private companies ( for example , by R. L. Polk ) . Both headers , of course , were available to me as well . Seidel told me to give him my license number . As I read each digit , he called it out to a woman somewhere nearby . A printer whined at me through the earpiece of my phone . " I hope there 's nothing embarrassing there , " I said . " Embarrassing ? " Seidel said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

An outfit called the Bureau of Protective Analysis markets the names of its 22,000 members . These people pay an annual fee , send off their urine , and in return get quarterly urinalysis reports so they can keep tabs on what the bureau calls the " eighteen potential trouble spots . " No one is spared a list life , not even subscribers to the New Yorker . The magazine began marketing its readers for the first time last year . Catalogue companies , magazines , causes , and concerns can rent the list for $90 per 1,000 names . The magazine expressly bars its use , however , for such crass endeavors as sweepstakes , real estate offers , politics , and fund-raising . ( Harper 's Magazine , too , rents its subscriber list . ) We get listed at earlier and earlier ages . Sesame Street magazine rents its subscriber list .

Often list owners are reluctant to say how they acquired the names on their lists . I phoned Globe Life and Accident Insurance Co. , in Oklahoma City , and asked Cynthia Cooke , list manager there , how she got my name ? and , for that matter , how she knew I was a father . ( 1 had received one of the 50 million direct-mail solicitations Globe posts every year . ) " I ca n't give that to you , " she said , I was ready with an argument of awesome , primitive power . " Why not ? " I asked . " It 's my name . " She laughed . " We have agreements with other people that we wo n't disclose that . And even if we did n't , we look upon that as proprietary information . We paid for the use of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it 's our business . " I was able to piece together a few trails , however . Here 's my favorite ? involving not me but my wife . Although she 's a voracious consumer , she generally shuns politics . Little did she know she 'd wind up in the thick of it ? just by ordering , by mail , a package of frozen beef from Omaha Steaks . Omaha Steaks rented her to the G. 0 . P. Victory Fund of the National Republican Congressional Committee and on a separate occasion to the National Security Political Action Committee . Each committee tapped the list on its own , without first trading notes . Is there some affinity then between Republicans and red meat ? " I think that 's an absurd statement , " said Elizabeth Fediay , chair of the National Security PAC , when I phoned her . " At some point someone probably assessed that this list has been successful with political fund-raising and political 44 activism. " he moment of truth , " Doug Anderson , a vice president of Claritas Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were sitting at a computer in a glass-enclosed room just off the company 's sleek blue-gray lobby . Claritas , Latin for " clarity , " is a target-marketing company , and Anderson had just enrered my current zip code into the computer . I also entrusted him with two other chunks of my life ? the zip I had when I lived in San Francisco and the zip I grew up with on Long Island . 1 was about to learn what kind of guy I am , what kind of guy I 've been . Claritas was founded by Jonathan Robbin , a man who delights in discovering correlations between seemingly unrelated behaviors ? for example , he now knows that people who listen to religious radio do n't eat salted nuts . Robbin pioneered the technique of blending census data , market research , and millions of other survey and statistical records , and then analyzing the result to predict consumer behavior . Claritas broke the country into forty neighborhood types , gave each a catchy , evocative name ( " Blue-Blood Estates , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , ranked them in order of affluence , and dubbed the system PRIZM , for Potential Rating Index for Zip Markets . The theory is that the Blue Bloods of California behave much like the Blue Bloods of New Jersey , although the former may have better tans . " The whole idea is that you can now assign every neighborhood in the United States to one of these forty types , " Robbin said . " These are enclaves where people live at one phase of their lives , or are living because they share the same interests and needs as everybody else . " In theory , a direct-mail company can divide a list of its best customers into PRIZM clusters , determine which clusters yield the best response rates , and then target those clusters throughout the country . Other companies have followed Claritas 's lead . Donnelley , for example , offers ClusterPLUS . CACI International , a defense contractor and information-services company based in Arlington , Virginia , offers ACORN : A Classification of Residential Neighborhoods . ACORN can provide the longitude and latitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 ' 15 " and longitude 76 ? 35 ' 40 " . Now even the Soviets can target my neighborhood . But back to Doug Anderson at his terminal . 66 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE i JULY 989 " All right , " he said . My current zip had bared itself on the screen . " You 've got a big mix of people here . " The cluster most heavily represented in my zip is " Downtown Dixie-Style , " downscale souls ranked fifth from last in terms of affluence . About 15 percent occupy cluster 32 , " Public Assistance . " The bottom rung . ( The number assigned to each cluster does not correspond to its affluence rank . ) This was just the first step . For target marketers , the zip is obsolete . Too broad . Indeed , my zip showed elements of thirteen different clusters . We needed to get closer , so Anderson typed in the number of my block group , the smallest census division , consisting of an average of 340 households . Not every household in America gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Census Bureau tucks people into " minor civil divisions . " In census-speak , I live in state 24 , county 510 , census tract 902 , block group 4 . In PRIM , that makes me a member of cluster 27 , " Levittown , U.S.A. " The thrill of self-discovery . There are things here I never knew about myself : I am an ice-hockey fan . 1 buy a lottery ticket one or more times each week . I went howling more than twenty-five times last year . 1 belong to a union , install my own faucets , most often frequent pancake houses and doughnut shops . I am not at all likely to chew tobacco or buy comedy tapes and records . Anderson now began to type in the block groups of my past . How far I 've fallen ! In San Francisco , I belonged to cluster 37 , " Bohemian Mix , " one notch higher on the affluence scale than Levittown . Those were heady times : I traveled by railroad and bought disco tapes . I drank matt liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or more movies every ninety days . I drank Pepsi Light . I did not own a chain saw , drive a pickup , or panel my own walls . Now , to the deep past ? Take me back , Doug ! State 36 , county 59 , census tract 4143.02 , block group 5 . Freeport , Long island . Cluster 27 . Again . Levittown re-dux . " You 've really come full circle , " Robbin said . " From a family back to a time , because I just made it up , is the First Law of Data Coalescence : Data must seek out and merge with other data . The shrinking cost of electronic computing and the advent of powerful list-enhancement software has triggered a wave of electromagnetic mergers . Data companies , and the data they collect , have merged in unprecedented volume over the past several years . The really momentous change , however , has been the entry of TRW and Equifax into target marketing . In 1985 , both companies set up formal marketing divisions . Since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriching their already robust files . They 've brought a powerful new tool to marketing ? the ability to track monthly changes in virtually every consumer 's financial behavior . But in transforming themselves from simple reporters to avid marketers , they 've shaken a fragile compact between themselves and consumers . 1 acquired my credit report from TRW for $5 . I 'd always imagined my report to be some kind of Deathstar in high elliptical orbit , periodically casting its shadow over my life . What a letdown . My report was a bland printout of credit lines , credit limits , and account balances , with columns of coded information telling whether I 've paid my bills on time . The report did , however , give me a sense of the unfolding of my consumer life ? there was my John Wanamaker 's department store account from my two-year stay in Philadelphia ; my account at Emporium Capwell in my " Bohemian Mix " days ; and my account at Granat Brothers ' San Francisco branch , the jewelry store where I paced the soft carpets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's engagement ring . Innocuous enough . But misleadingly innocuous . It 's how the credit bureaus now use this information that gives it life , and gives one pause . Neither TRW nor Equifax directly provides a marketer with credit reports . They instead compile lists of consumer names that reflect the credit data . L. L. Bean , for example , could request a list of all consumers who possess a bank card with $5,000 or more of available credit . ( Neither company allows a search by specific brand of card . ) TRW then searches its files and pulls a few million names . The company , however , wo n't return that list directly to Bean , but rather to a third-party printer , ostensibly to protect the privacy of consumers who fit the search criteria . TRW also uses its credit files to build statistical models of consumers . Say L. L. Bean wants to know if those who do not respond to its catalogues have something in common . Bean gives TRW a list of those who did not respond ; TRW finds those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demographic , and auto-registration information it can on each one , and then tries to find the common thread that makes these people so recalcitrant . TRW and Equifax do n't need to scavenge for their credit data . It comes to them in a monthly monsoon , unbeckoned , from creditors who by agreement report to them every thirty days . This in turn allows the bureaus to detect when a consum er gets more credit , a new mortgage , or experiences some other change in status ? change being the stuff of marketers ' dreams . Change rejuvenates us consumers . The new house we purchase needs down comforters from the Company Store , an armoire from Conran 's , a set of chairs from Williams-Sonoma . Word that some lucky soul just got a new credit card can set the direct-mail world aflame . A newsletter sent to me by Listworld , a broker of credit-related lists in Huntsville , Alabama , put it this way : " The holder of a new credit card is a perfect target for just about everything . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented the intrusion but considered it the company 's tight . No law required that the company lend me $100,000 . My wife and I allowed ourselves to be evaluated because we stood to get something valuable in return . Now , however , without any agreement from me , marketing companies can gain access to my credit history ? not to provide me with credit , but to sell me something . TRW , for example , turned my wife and me over to CPC Associates , a list company in Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania , which in turn rented us to American Mailing Co-Op in Plymouth , Minnesota , which decided we were a " special " family and offered us a peek at Wilderness Resort , fifty-four miles outside Washington , D.C. This special family did n't want a peek at Wilderness Resort . We threw the mail out . Is that what it all comes down to : 68 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / JULY 1989 pensity to consume . We 'll track you for the rest of your consuming life ? pitch you baby toys when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps we could demand they get our permission first , and insist on royalties tied to the number of names in a given database . We could negotiate exclusive licensing agreements and insist on lifelong retainers . Think of it : some of those envelopes with checks peeking from those little plastic windows would actually contain real checks , not worthless look-alikes designed only to lure us inside . The data keepers say we have nothing to fear , that they are scrupulous about protecting our records . They insist , too , that they have no use for dossiers on individuals , and use the detail available only to help target broad markets and to know the " hot buttons " that make those markets respond . Yes . But the world changes . Events occur and movements swell that cause people to sacrifice the rights of their peers .

" It is an interesting exercise to imagine the big marketing databases put to use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What , for instance , might health insurers do with the subscription lists of gay publications such as the Advocate and the New York Native ? If I am only uneasy , and not panicked , it is because I continue to harbor faith that the direct mailers and name harvesters do n't really know what they 're doing ? at least not yet . Some still ca n't tell that my wife , who goes by her maiden name , Gleason , is indeed my wife we get two copies of most of our direct mail . And there is an ever growing list of catalogue companies that insist that one of us is Gleason Larson . I take comfort , too , in knowing that Mother Jones and the conservative National Security PAC both seemed to feel my wife was worthy of their attention . What delights me most , however , is that the folks at Victoria 's Secret still send me their catalogue , that zesty album of gorgeous babes in skimpy lingerie ; they still believe Pm a woman named Laura Lange .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
