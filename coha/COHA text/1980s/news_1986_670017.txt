NEW YORK  --  In a surprise move , Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said it named John Sias , president of Capital Cities publishing division , as the new head of its ABC unit . He succeeds Frederick S. Pierce , 52 years old , who resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of ABC yesterday , as expected . Mr. Pierce will become a consultant to ABC and remain a member of the board of the combined company . Thomas S. Murphy , Capital Cities/ABC chairman and chief executive , said additional management and organizational changes at the merged company would be announced during the next several weeks . In selecting Mr. Sias , 58 , to become president of ABC , Capital Cities has turned to a highly regarded executive cut from the Capital Cities mold , but untested in network programming , the area in which ABC needs the most help . However , like his bosses , he is likely to follow the Capital Cities formula of attracting and keeping the best executives , then leaving them alone to do their jobs . " He ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Murphy . " There are a lot of able people at ABC to support him . We know what he can do  --  he ' s got the brains , the commitment and the integrity . " Both Mr. Sias ' s appointment and Mr. Pierce ' s resignation are effective today . ABC has been struggling since last season to climb out of last place in the network ratings race . In the final ratings week of 1985 , ABC didn ' t have any prime-time shows rank among the top 20 . Mr. Pierce , who is credited with ABC ' s programming successes in the 1960s and 1970s , is expected to work on programming in his consulting role . And the appointment of Mr. Sias probably will give wide freedom to Brandon Stoddard , 48 , who was named the network ' s chief programming executive in November . At Capital Cities , Mr. Sias had responsibility for its daily and weekly newspapers , shopping guides and its specialty publications unit , which includes Institutional Investor and Fairchild Publications , publisher of Women ' s Wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 million , or 63% , of Capital Cities 1984 revenue , and $133. 2 million , or 48% , of the company ' s operating profit . Mr. Sias joined Capital Cities in 1971 as president of Fairchild Publications from Metromedia Inc. , a broadcasting company , where he held several executive positions . He previously worked at Westinghouse Electric Corp. ' s broadcasting division . While that gives Mr. Sias some broadcasting background and the publishing division ' s track record is strong  --  revenue and profit grew about 20% annually from 1980 to 1984  --  Mr. Murphy acknowledged , " Obviously , it would be better if he ( Mr. Sias ) had a lot of network experience . " Mr. Murphy added , " He ' s got some catching up to do , but he ' s a very able executive . " He is also one of Capital Cities ' more colorful executives . James Brady , a former publisher and executive at Fairchild Publications and now editor-at-large at Advertising Age , said Mr. Sias used to wear a Captain Marvel T-shirt under his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said in a recent Advertising Age column , Mr. Sias caught the attention of advertisers by running across a parking lot  --  on the top of the roofs of parked cars . Analysts expressed surprise at the selection of Mr. Sias . " That ' s a mind blower , " said Edward Atorino , broadcasting analyst for Smith Barney , Harris Upham Inc . " He is the most unlikely person to be put in charge of the ABC network , " he said . Mr. Murphy said Mr. Pierce ' s resignation was unexpected , and that he had asked Mr. Pierce to remain in his position . When Mr. Murphy couldn ' t persuade the executive to stay on , he said , he considered several other ABC officers for the top post before deciding to select Mr. Sias . Mr. Pierce said his decision to leave ABC after 30 years with the company was tied to changes in " circumstances " that he wouldn ' t identify . " I ' ve just been rethinking this over the last three or four weeks , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided on Monday to make a career change . " Industry sources have said Mr. Pierce , once the clear successor to American Broadcasting Cos. ' former chairman , Leonard H. Goldenson , was disappointed over losing the opportunity to run ABC as a separate company , and getting a lesser role in the new one . Mr. Goldenson , 79 , stepped down Friday , when the merger took effect , but remains chairman of the company ' s executive committee . Mr. Murphy and Capital Cities ' president and chief operating officer , Daniel B. Burke , hold the same positions in the new company . Mr. Pierce , who also was vice chairman of the merged company , reported to Mr. Burke . " I had no problem with working with Tom ( Murphy ) and Dan ( Burke ) , " Mr. Pierce said . " There are other factors involved that were personal considerations . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
