Construction surges despite a glut in natural gas <P> Seen from an airplane , it looks like a giant scar stretching across the Great Plains and over the horizon . For much of last summer , however , the scene featured countless lengths of steel pipe lying like uncooked spaghetti beside deep ditches . Here and there clusters of yellow machines and men in hard hats or baseball caps could be seen , many of them bare-chested under the hot sun , some working under the shade of umbrellas attached to the pipes . <P> The work is now nearly finished , and the result is a 793-mile stretch of natural gas pipeline that extends eastward from Whitney Canyon , Wyo. , to a terminal in Beatrice , Neb . There the pipeline will become a part of existing gas lines leading to the population and industrial centers of the East , delivering 350 million cu . ft. of fuel per day to customers by Oct. 15 . Named Trailblazer , because it is the first major pipeline to transport gas from the Rocky Mountain Overthrust Belt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 36-in. line is the work of five different interstate gas-transmission companies-Colorado Interstate Gas Co. , Columbia Gulf Transmission Co. , Mountain Fuel Resources , Inc. , Northern Natural Resources Co. and Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America . Together the firms already service one out of every four natural gas customers in the country . Their latest project is a part of what has become the biggest gas-pipeline building boom of its kind in the U.S. in 30 years . <P> From the dusty high plains of Montana to the fertile corn belt in eastern Iowa , workmen by the thousands have completed another and bigger project , the Northern Border Pipeline . The line reaches 823 miles from the Canadian border at Alberta to the Midwestern U.S. , and by November will be transporting 975 million cu . ft. of fuel per day , or enough to heat 1.4 million homes in the dead of winter . Construction of the $1.1 billion system began in the spring of 1981 , and has required on occasion as many as 5,000 hardhats and other workers , laboring at nine different sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This is the largest privately financed pipeline project ever undertaken , the largest of its kind in the free world . " <P> Northern Border is only a segment of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System , a mammoth four-pipeline network intended to make Alaska 's vast natural gas reserves available to the rest of the U.S. Expected to be completed by the end of the decade , the system will provide the country with enough fuel to heat 4.5 million homes per day at peak capacity . Though the pipeline has been plagued by financing problems and construction start-up delays , it is seen by industry experts as an important complement to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System , which carries 1.5 million bbl. of crude oil per day from Prudhoe Bay on the Beaufort Sea to the port of Valdez , 800 miles to the south . All together , the entire gas-pipeline network is aimed at ensuring adequate fuel supplies for industrial and home-heating use until the turn of the century and beyond .               @ @ @ @ @ @
