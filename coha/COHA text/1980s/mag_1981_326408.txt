Franois Mitterrand needed a moderate Premier who could reassure a nation still caught uneasily between jubilation and the jitters over the novelty of a Socialist in the Elyse Palace . But he could not accept another bloodless technocrat of the kind that he had criticized in the Giscard regime . He needed a political figure with a popular touch . No one fit that description better than Pierre Mauroy , 52 . The big ( 6 ft. 2 in. ) burly mayor of the northern industrial center of Lille , Mauroy ( pronounced Mawr-wah ) is an archetypal man of the north , pragmatic , hardworking and direct . He was born in the town of Cartignies , the grandson of a woodcutter and the son of a teacher . His family moved in 1936 to the steelworkers ' village of Haussy , where the weekly Socialist street demonstration was the major public event . " At eight years old , " he recalled in his book , Heirs to the Future , " I already knew the Internationale . " After World War II , Mauroy became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . He eventually moved to Lille and became mayor in 1973 . Mauroy 's meeting with Mitterrand in 1965 was a union between a dogged tactician and a strategic visionary that helped transform the party . In the early 1970s , Mitterrand visualized a broad alliance with the Communist Party ; Mauroy hammered out the details . When the alliance collapsed , Mauroy brought the idealistic Mitterrand back to the pragmatic center . The new Premier is expected to pursue what is possible , unblinded by what he once called " the illusion of revolution . " Mauroy , said Le Monde , is " an authentic socialist . . . a man who incarnates at once a legitimacy , an attitude and a region . "
