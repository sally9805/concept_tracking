Robert Moses : 1888-1981 <P> " By courage and sheer logic and the ultimate ring of truth , men and women without conspicuously agreeable personalities have often won a place in history as great figures of their time . " <P> <P> Robert Moses , the author of that sentiment , was conspicuously disagreeable , and he never doubted he was one of the great figures of his time . He once likened himself to the Roman Emperor Titus ( 40-81 A.D. ) , who , like Moses , was an impresario of bricks and marble . The Moses empire embraced yachts , chefs , chauffeurs and 86,000 other minions . His power nominally depended on the chairmanships of obscure parks commissions and revenues from a toll bridge . In fact , he relied on a public as steadfastly admiring of him as he was contemptuous of them . He defied Governors and mayors for nearly half a century , outmaneuvered even Franklin D. Roosevelt , imposed his vision on millions of acres of New York City and State , and inspired the reshaping of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor legislator , just a self-described " senior ditchdigger , " he was at once utterly pragmatic and utterly visionary . His skill , he said , was " getting things done . " His genius was in seeing and serving the needs of future generations without flinching at the uprooting or expense he inflicted on the present one . When he died last week of congestive heart failure at 92 , still in office as a $35,000-a-year consultant to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority , his legacy included : a metropolitan highway system in New York City bigger than the one in Los Angeles ; the Lincoln Center cultural complex ; the United Nations headquarters ; and his last project , the 1964-65 New York World 's Fair . Moses left behind twelve bridges , 35 highways , 658 playgrounds and more than 2 million acres of parks . He also built two Robert Moses state parks , a Robert Moses Causeway , a Robert Moses Parkway , a Robert Moses Dam at Niagara and another at Massena , which bears his name in stainless steel letters 3 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson Rockefeller in 1968 , it was estimated he had spent the equivalent of $27 billion . <P> Robert Caro , who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for a critical investigative biography of Moses , The Power Broker , calls him quite simply the greatest builder in American history . Says Urban Scholar Lewis Mumford , perhaps the most persistent critic of the immensity and impersonality of typical Moses projects : " In the 20th century , the influence of Robert Moses on the cities of America was greater than that of any other person . " Like Frederick Law Olmsted , the 19th century landscape architect who built Manhattan 's Central Park , Moses believed in the democratizing effect of recreation . His goal was not simply to preserve beauty or connect neighborhoods , but to change the way the common man lived . His vision , alas , was sometimes misguided . A champion of the automobile ( though he always had a chauffeur and never learned to drive ) , Moses hated mass transit . He designed parkways on Long Island with overpasses too low to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers of a kind now associated with alienation and crime .
