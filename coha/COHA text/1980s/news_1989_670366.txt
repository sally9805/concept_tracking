NEW YORK  --  For weeks , takeover-stock traders have held out hope that even if Time Inc. succeeds in its plan to buy Warner Communications for $14 billion , Paramount or another company would still go after the combined behemoth . But Paramount cast doubts on those dreams late yesterday . If the Time-Warner deal goes through , it " effectively precludes any bidder at all , " a Paramount spokesman said in response to a question . It " absolutely precludes any bidder at a price near $200 a share  --  and that , of course , includes us . " Traders have been focusing on a combined Time-Warner because many are betting that a Delaware judge will endorse Time ' s plan to merge with Warner . Paramount and some Time shareholders are trying to block the Time-Warner deal ; a court hearing on that effort is scheduled for today . A combined Time Warner  --  big but deeply in debt  --  would certainly be a big bite for any company . It ' s not clear how many potential suitors would have the financial muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few on Wall Street suggest that Time Warner would be out of reach merely because of size . The expense of buying Time Warner stock , plus the assumption of the company ' s debt , would total roughly $30 billion , analysts and investment bankers say . That would compare with $30. 6 billion for the RJR Nabisco takeover . Although not impossible , says one merger specialist , " a $30 billion deal is tough for anybody to do . " What would make it even tougher is that by borrowing heavily to buy Warner at $70 a share , Time would use up much of its capacity to pay debt service out of cash flow . Depending on exactly how the purchase of Warner is structured , the combined company could have as much as $14 billion of debt on its balance sheet . Under the original Time-Warner stock swap merger , which wouldn ' t have required the company to add any new debt , it would have had only $2. 6 billion in debt . Analysts offer a number of reasons why Paramount might not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $200 a share , or $12. 2 billion , for Time alone would require Paramount to incur $15. 6 billion of debt ( including some refinancing of existing Paramount debt ) . " The way the Time-Warner deal is structured now , I don ' t think that Paramount could go after them , " says David Londoner , a media and entertainment analyst at Wertheim Schroder . The only way Paramount could launch such a bid , he believes , is with an equity partner or equity infusion of $3 billion to $3. 5 billion . And he sees this outcome as unlikely , because it would require Paramount either to give up some control or to severely dilute the interests of its current shareholders . In anticipation of today ' s court hearing , Time shares weakened early yesterday . But they recovered after Paramount said it would pay 9% a year interest on its $200-a-share bid until the deal closes , under certain circumstances . Time closed at 152 5/8 , up 1 1/8 . Warner finished at 62 , up 1/4 , while Paramount closed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time could make itself impossible to swallow is no idle speculation . In today ' s hearing in Delaware ' s Chancery Court , Chancellor William T. Allen will hear arguments from Paramount and various Time shareholders who view the Warner takeover plan as a " takeover-proofing " ploy by Time , which denies the charge , calling the merger part of its corporate strategy . In support of its argument , Paramount will refer to an affidavit by Stephen M. Waters , a Morgan Stanley investment banker , in which Mr. Waters said that combining Time and Warner would exhaust the companies ' debt capacity . In the affidavit , which was filed yesterday , Mr. Waters said the combined companies would cost $31 billion at $200 a share and that few companies would have both the financial capacity and interest in buying Time Warner . Despite the big numbers involved , takeover experts don ' t automatically dismiss the idea that somebody could make a run at the combined Time Warner if Chancellor Allen permits Time to proceed with its current cash tender offer for 100 million Warner shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the rest of Warner with an as-yet-undetermined mix of cash , debt and equity securities valued at $70 a share . " The fact that Time Warner would be highly leveraged doesn ' t make it takeoverproof at all , " says Charles Nathan , co-head of mergers at Salomon Brothers . " The real question is , can you double-leverage ? Can you borrow more money to put on top of this already highly leveraged enterprise ? " Mr. Nathan adds : " The sheer size of it doesn ' t make it undoable , but it certainly limits the number of players who can do it . You need a very large balance sheet and a lot of liquidity to do a deal of that size . " Wall Street estimates of the price that a bidder would have to pay for a combined Time Warner vary widely , partly because analysts have made different assumptions about how the second half of the Time-Warner deal will be structured . Mr. Londoner estimates that the combined company will have a net asset value of about $177 a share and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation abates . His calculation is based on an assumption that Time will use half cash and half stock to pay for the second part of the Warner acquisition . Analysts at Drexel Burnham Lambert who follow Time and Warner believe the net asset value of the combined company will be about $240 a share , and should trade between $145 and $160 a share , although they caution that the stock could fall further if takeover-stock speculators try to unload their Time shares all at once . The Drexel analysts ' estimate is based on an assumption that Time will pay all cash for Warner , although that seems unlikely because of various covenants in Time ' s bank-loan agreements . The main source of the higher value in the Drexel estimate is the Warner acquisition . Andrew Wallach , the Drexel analyst who follows Warner , believes the acquisition will add about $20 a share to Time ' s value . Mr. Wallach places some fairly high values on Warner ' s main businesses : $3. 8 billion for its movie and television production units , $5. 3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cable-television and broadcasting units . But , as he points out , any buyer who began selling assets of either Time or Warner would have to pay big capital-gains taxes , because most of the two companies ' properties have very low book values for tax purposes . Some observers also wonder if the value of Warner ' s movie studio and record business would be diminished if Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross weren ' t around to cultivate the company ' s relationships with its star performers . Buying Time Warner would be " a monster deal , " says Mr. Wallach . " It has to be a pretty low-probability event.
