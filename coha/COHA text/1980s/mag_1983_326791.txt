Simmering tensions erupt <P> In some places the city resembled a ghost town , in others a smoldering battlefield . Throughout Sri Lanka 's palm-fringed , seaside capital , Colombo ( pop . 586,000 ) , shops were shuttered and restaurants were closed . Small groups of helmeted troops patrolled the empty streets , with instructions to shoot curfew violators on sight . But those tough measures may have come too late . During the previous five days , bands of Buddhist Sinhalese , 50 to 100 strong , had smashed , burned and plundered thousands of houses and shops belonging to predominantly Hindu Tamils . In Colombo 's jail , 52 Tamils had been bludgeoned to death . As the worst riots in the history of the island republic subsided , 50,000 Tamils were left homeless and at least 140 people were dead . <P> The bloodshed was triggered by the incendiary actions of a small group of Tamil extremists who contend that their race , which accounts for 11% of the nation 's 15 million people , should be granted a separate homeland in northern Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted bombs , set government buildings ablaze and , according to the government , killed 73 Sinhalese in and around the Tamil-dominated northern city of Jaffna . Only two weeks ago , Tamil terrorists ambushed and slaughtered 13 Sinhalese soldiers . <P> President Junius R. ( " J.R . " ) Jayawardene , 76 , has tried to mollify moderate Tamils by offering them jobs , encouraging them to use their own language and delegating some local responsibility to them . But Jayawardene had also ordered his troops to stamp out the separatists by force and , according to an Amnesty International report , had sent Tamils to prisons in which they have been brutally tortured . Forced in May to invoke the fifth state of emergency since Jayawardene took office in 1977 , the Sri Lankan government last Saturday proposed a constitutional amendment that would ban the secessionist party , as well as all separatist activity . <P> Although Sri Lanka 's 12,000-man army is too weak to maintain order , Jayawardene has so far refused to request assistance from Indian troops . But necessity may prove the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments in Jayawardene 's free-enterprise system are run by hard-working Tamils ; many of those buildings now he in ashes . Unless the government acts decisively , still more of Sri Lanka 's economy may go up in flames .
