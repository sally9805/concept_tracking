The price-battered U.S. gropes toward more indexation <P> The nation 's 35.2 million Social Security recipients are receiving a pleasant surprise this month . Their July checks have been increased by a helpful 14.3% . Like about one-quarter of all Americans , they are receiving a cost of living adjustment ( COLA ) designed to ease the pain of inflation . As double-digit price rises continue to erode their incomes , many weary consumers see a COLA as the pause that refreshes . But critics charge that automatic income adjustments may push the U.S. economy into a permanent inflation high . <P> Indexation , the system of pegging payments such as salaries or Government Social Security benefits to the rate of inflation , is a siren that has attracted supporters on both the political right and left . Milton Friedman , a sometime adviser to Ronald Reagan , has advocated COLAs as a stopgap to mitigate the social disruptions caused by soaring prices while action is taken to bring inflation under control . And Rudy Oswald , chief economist of the AFL-CIO , says , " Indexation allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken place . " <P> The Federal Government is already heavily hooked on COLA . In the 1981 budget , 42% of all Government outlays will go to programs whose benefits are indexed . These include civil service pensions , food stamps and disability payments . The largest chunk , $140 billion , will go for Social Security benefits , and the latest 14.3% boost has added $20 billion to the budget . <P> Indexation is also widespread in the private sector of the economy . The United Auto Workers in 1948 negotiated the first labor contract that included a COLA clause . The percentage of employees covered by cost of living escalators has risen from 26% in 1965 to 58% at the beginning of 1980 . The current auto agreement , which is typical of those for many major unions , pays workers an extra penny an hour for each three-tenths-point rise in the Consumer Price Index . That has increased the average hourly wage so far this year by 71 , to $9.84 . Such escalator provisions usually match only 50% to 70% of consumer price increases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society . Atlanta landlords , for example , insert COLA clauses in office leases . Divorce settlements often contain a clause that increases child support and alimony payments according to rises in the CPI . California and a few other states have indexed their income taxes . This automatically raises the amount of earnings covered by each tax bracket , thus keeping tax rates the same even though inflation-bloated incomes are increasing . <P> Republican Senator William Armstrong of Colorado has proposed indexing federal income taxes . He and others maintain that inflation is pushing people into tax categories originally intended for only the superrich . Americans will pay $14 billion more in federal taxes this year solely because of inflation-induced salary increases . Says Armstrong : " The problem now is that the recipients of federal money are all indexed , while the people paying the taxes are not . If there 's no possibility to deindex recipients , then it 's only fair that we protect taxpayers through an indexation of taxes . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
