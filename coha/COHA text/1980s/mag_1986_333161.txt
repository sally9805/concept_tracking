Every September , as the baseball and football seasons converge , newcomers arrive to begin inheriting a game , minor-league baseball players in buses , major college football players in limousines . If they have always been connected , this year they seem entwined . <P> The most prominent National Football League rookies  --  Dallas Runner Herschel Walker and Buffalo Quarterback Jim Kelly  --  have come from a kind of minor league , the dormant U.S.F.L. The preeminent college football player of 1985  --  Auburn 's " Bo " Jackson  --  has gone to baseball . If the football scouts are right about Jackson 's being a " bigger and stronger O.J. Simpson , " and the baseball scouts are right about his " Mantle-like speed and power " and " Clemente-like throwing arm , " then both sports have been significantly affected by the small events of an Alabama childhood that led to this unlikely choice . <P> In his heart , the Heisman Trophy winner , the No. 1 pick of the N.F.L. , was never a football player at all . " Really , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me to play , " says Jackson , who declined millions in Tampa Bay to accept hundreds of thousands in Kansas City . " ' I 'm not having you all broke up and limping and sore , ' she 'd say . When I 'd come home that way , she 'd lock me out . I 'd stay the night with friends . " <P> The first organized sport Jackson attempted was baseball , an upset itself in Bessemer ( near Birmingham ) , where he was sired by a steel man and grew up among ten children inspired by a hotel maid . " I played Little League for about two weeks before they decided I was too rough and moved me up to the Pony League . When I was supposed to be in the Pony League , I was playing in a men 's semipro league . I never played with friends my own age . " In the ninth grade , he took up football just to be a ninth-grader . " Baseball was more of a game , " he thought from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge too , but mostly a responsibility . " <P> Dichotomies abound in Vincent Edward Jackson , 23 , nicknamed Bo for the resemblance he once bore to a boar . As a boy , Jackson was a bully with a gentle streak . At Auburn , he seemed as apt to persevere with a separated shoulder as to demur with a tender hamstring . " You would n't call him a gung- ho practice player , " Coach Pat Dye recalls fondly . " I 'm sure it was like work to him , but it never looked that way . Baseball thinks Rickey Henderson is fast . They 're going to find out what speed is . Speed , size , grace , courage . He had everything you 'd ever want in a football player . " <P> In speech , Jackson is full of Bo , given to admiring himself in the third person . Yet he stammers slightly . " But you can be a millionaire , " college teammates urged him , " and live the dream . " He told them , " Bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop was Memphis , home of the Chicks , where hitters right out of the egg can begin striking a gingerly acquaintance with curve balls . After 45 at bats , the most famous rightfielder in all of Double A had four hits ( .089 ) . " I 've always got off slow in baseball , " he says . " That 's the only sport I 've ever got off slow in . " Thereafter , Jackson batted .338 , including one home run that measured at 554 ft.
