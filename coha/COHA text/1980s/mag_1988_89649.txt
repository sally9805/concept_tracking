Just where Michigan Avenue in Chicago becomes Lake Shore Drive , on a residential block that strikes one as a pleasant anachronism among the towers of the near North Side , there is a row of turn-of-the-century brick houses . At one a small woman in her late 50 's answers the door . Her white-blonde hair is drawn back from her face in a bun . her back is as straight as a plebe 's , and her blue eyes , which sportswriters of the late 1940s usually mentioned in their stories about her , are wide , warm and ready to be amused . // Barbara Ann Scott , now Mrs. Thomas V. King , was the Katarina Witt of 1947 and ' 48 . Twice world figure skating champion and twice the European champion , she won the gold medal at the 1948 Winter Games in St. Moritz , to become Canada 's first Winter Olympic individual champion . To veteran figure skating observers she was the long-awaited successor to Norway 's fabled three-time Olympic gold medalist ( 1928 , ' 32 , ' 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henie in two respects : She thrived on competition  --  the tougher the better  --  and she was master of the compulsory figures , those meticulous tracings of circles , loops and brackets , which in her day counted for 60% of a competitor 's total score . ( Today school figures are down to 30% of the total. ) // Figures were the reason Scott practiced eight hours a day for 12 years . There were 70 of them , all combinations of and variations on the figure eight . In competition , skaters were required to perform six figures three times each , first on one foot , then on the other . " In my day , " says Scott , " you often did n't know until the night before which six of the 70 figures you were going to have to do . You really had to know them all . " // Scott 's contemporaries at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa , her hometown , once calculated that she skated 11 miles a day on figures alone . " I like detail , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat and tidy and symmetrical . I enjoyed trying to get as near perfect a circle as possible . It just interested me . " In competition Scott would typically build an insurmountable lead in the school figures , which would see her through the free skating , Throughout the 1947 and ' 48 international championships , however , she was unbeatable in free skating , too . // " She was delicate , precise , exact , meticulous  --  simply perfect , " recalls Dick Button , the American who won Olympic gold medals in the men 's division in 1948 and ' 52 . " She did everything right , and there was nobody to challenge her who was better in one particular area , either compulsory figures or free skating . Everything was right , everything was perfect . " // She was the daughter of Col. Clyde Scott , military secretary to Canada 's minister for defense , and the goddaughter of Conservative Prime Minister ( 1930-35 ) R.B. Bennett . Although the Scotts were well connected in Ottawa 's social and governmental circles , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his widow , Mary , and Barbara , then 13 , lived on his $3,000-a-year government pension . In 1947 , when international competition resumed following World War II , the expenses for Scott 's first European tour , approximately $10,000 , were met by a group of her late father 's influential friends . One of them also gave her a beaver coat . " Going over to Europe that year we flew in a converted Lancaster bomber that had benches instead of seats , " says Scott . " That coat was great ; I could roll up in it and sleep . " // When Scott arrived in Davos , Switzerland , for the European championships in January of 1947 , she was the reigning Canadian and North American champion ( she had defeated Gretchen Merrill of Boston for the latter title ) . However Merrill , who was the U.S. champion , attracted most of the attention during the weeks of practice that preceded the competition . // " They did n't realize that North American meant Canada and the United States , " says Scott . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What 's it like to live in an ice house ? ' Ice house ? Then I realized they thought I was an Eskimo . " The memory makes Scott roar with laughter . // In the end it was Scott herself who set the record straight . When she won the European title , the crowds stood and chanted " Barbarelli , Barbarelli , " and , two weeks later , at the world championships in Stockholm , where Scott huddled in her gift coat as temperatures dipped to-20 F and the program listed her as Barbara Annscott , eight of the nine judges awarded her first place . Ulrich Salchow , the Swedish skater who created the jump now named for him , said , " She combined her difficult program in an artistic way so that her stunts were mixed up in astonishing surprises , all executed in an easy style , as if she skated only to have a good time for herself . " // When Scott returned to Ottawa in March 1947 , schoolchildren were given half the day off , two bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor handed her the keys to a yellow Buick convertible . Two months later , at a humiliating ceremony in the showroom of an Ottawa Buick dealer , Scott gave the car back . Avery Brundage , the not-so-benevolent despot of the Olympic movement , had notified the International Olympic Committee that in his view Scott relinquished her amateur standing when she accepted the Buick . All Canada was outraged . A Toronto Globe and Mail columnist addressed an open letter to Scott that began , " We read in the public prints where some acorn named Avery Umbrage , who lives down in the Excited States , is trying to have you expelled from the amateur ranks .... " // The Olympic year of 1948 saw Scott progress triumphantly through the European championships in Prague to the Winter Games in St. Moritz to the worlds in Davos  --  figure skating 's grand slam . Her face was on the cover of TIME , and her wax likeness went on display at Madame Tussaud 's in London . During the European championships the Prague newspapers published her picture 17 times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayworth had been so honored when she visited the city a few weeks earlier . // Late in 1948 Scott turned professional . According to a friend , " For Barbara Ann , turning professional was like going astray . " She had been a proper Ottawa debutante , given to hats , white gloves and pearls  --  " plain Jane , " as she puts it  --  and suddenly she was onstage at New York 's Roxy Theater doing five shows a day in plunging necklines and feather headdresses . " I always tried to put in a double loop or a double Salchow , which meant nothing to anybody but to me , but sometimes I 'd hear somebody way up there going clap , clap , clap , and I 'd think , Ooh , there 's a skater , a friend . " she says . There followed a 10,000-mile , 20-week tour of Canada with her own show , Skating Sensations of 1950 , a guest stint with the Ice Capades , a Rudolph Friml operetta in London called Rose Marie on Ice , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revue. // " Mr. Wirtz had the most wonderful show , " says Scott . " If your costume was trimmed with mink , it was real mink . There was a cape made of foxtails that went from white at the top to midnight blue at the bottom that I wore just for entrances , and oh , it was so heavy . I remember one night the line boys picked me up , and they were turning around , and they had this big thing spread out all over them . The boy who was holding me up tripped on something , and I heard him say , ' Oh , oh , we 're going ! ' All of a sudden the whole lot of us went right down under all those foxtails . Very glamorous . " // Scott retired from show business in 1955 , without regret , and married Tommy King , who had been a pro basketball player for the Detroit Falcons of the Basketball Association of America . At the time King was publicist for Wirtz 's various sporting , entertainment and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hopalong Cassidy  --  on a tour of baseball parks , " says King . " We even played Yankee Stadium ; had a six-ring circus . I was so proud of that . We opened to 65,000 people on a Thursday night . " // For the past 30 years Scott 's main interest , apart from husband and house , has been horses , saddlebreds that she and King have owned and shown in local and regional shows . Every day Scott drives from downtown Chicago to Morton Grove , a northwest suburb , to groom and exercise a mare named Lady . " I showed her for many years , " says Scott . " But I 've sort of retired her now . Getting up at six in the morning to stand all day in the sun and the dust and the heat lost some of its glamour . " // Order and self-discipline , tempered by a sense of humor , have characterized Scott 's life . They served her well through the physical and emotional rigors of world-class competition and later in the hurly-burly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in active middle age . Her house has a small swimming pool in the basement equipped with a dancer 's barre at which she exercises every day , even if that means getting into the pool at midnight . // Button , who remains a good friend , says , " I 'm sure there have been some tough moments in her life , but she gives the impression of always being happy and in charge . A lot of it comes down to the picture one has of oneself . I 'm sure the picture Barbara Ann has of herself has always been very clear . "
