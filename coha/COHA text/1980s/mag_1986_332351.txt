In a sense Gerald Probst , the chairman of Sperry , was like a general on the wrong side of a surrender ceremony as he sat with Burroughs Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal last week at a press conference in Manhattan 's St. Regis Hotel . For a year Probst had resisted a determined drive by Burroughs to take over his company and thereby form the world 's second-largest computer manufacturer , after IBM . In the end , though , the advance was irresistible . New York City-based Sperry agreed to be acquired by its Detroit rival for $4.8 billion . A triumphant Blumenthal said he hoped that this " major new force " in computers would give IBM some real competition at last . <P> With combined revenues of $10.7 billion , the new company , which has yet to be named , will easily pass Massachusetts-based Digital Equipment ( 1985 revenues : $7 billion ) , the current No. 2 computer maker . Blumenthal , 60 , who will be chairman , said the Burroughs-Sperry combination hoped to slash costs and boost profits by merging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support services . <P> Probst , 62 , will stay on as vice chairman , but he did not conceal his mixed emotions last week . Said he : " We are totally convinced that we could have continued to be a viable competitor to IBM . But we recognize that , being a public company , we are not always masters of our destiny . " <P> Burroughs first approached Sperry 's board of directors last year , with a $65-a share offer . Sperry , which was trading at $55 a share , rejected the bid as inadequate , but became concerned that Blumenthal would try a hostile takeover . Probst reportedly talked with several other firms , including General Dynamics and AT &T,; about topping Burroughs ' offer in a friendly merger deal . Since none of those discussions panned out , Sperry was vulnerable when Blumenthal came back with a $70-a-share bid last month . After Sperry balked again , Burroughs said it would make a tender offer directly to shareholders . Finally Blumenthal made Sperry an offer almost impossible to refuse : $76.50 a share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the offer . President Joseph Kroger led the opposition to the merger and did not appear at the press conference , but he is expected to head the Sperry division of the company , at least for the time being . <P> While the new firm will have some 12% of the world market for mainframe computers , it will still be hard pressed to challenge mighty IBM , which controls nearly 63% . Critics note that Burroughs and Sperry computers do not run the same programs and thus can not be linked together . Some customers are already nervous : a group of 17 New England companies that use Sperry computers wrote Blumenthal last week to ask if Burroughs would discontinue their machines . In a telephone call to Elaine Massa , technical-services manager for Connecticut Natural Gas , Blumenthal assured the group that he has no intention of dropping Sperry products . <P> Sperry managers may be another matter . The company that sold Univac , the first successful commercial computer , in the 1950s has lost much of its marketing sparkle in recent years . Entrenched bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " As a manager , there is almost nothing you can do to get fired here . " Considering the new circumstances , those could be famous last words .
