The wisdom of the U.S. invasion of Grenada will be debated for years . The unprecedented exclusion of the American press from that operation requires no debate ; clearly it was a bad mistake , an outrage to press freedom and an ominous symptom of a tendency in the Reagan Administration to try to control the flow of information . <P> All Administrations attempt to do this , up to a point . Actually the Reagan White House has been far more intelligent and helpful in its dealings with the press than was customary during the Nixon age of paranoia and the Carter era of petty meanness . Thus the attempt to fight a little war in secret , out of range of reporters and cameramen , is all the more startling and unfortunate . <P> The explanations offered by the Administration were preposterous . Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger argued that the armed forces could not have guaranteed the safety of journalists . But American journalists have never demanded such guarantees . They have worked and died in the Civil War , World War I , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saigon . Weinberger 's other reason , that the commander in the field did not want the press along , was a glaring copout . No question was raised about press coverage aiding the enemy ; that was wise . The press invariably accepts ground rules on matters of true security , where lives and operations are at stake . <P> Why should anyone care about this ? Many people might assume that the press was protesting against its exclusion out of a prurient or even commercial itch , annoyed at missing some sensational headlines and pictures . That is simply not the case . The press has a serious quasi-constitutional function as a representative of the public . Obviously the White House or the Pentagon remembered the Viet Nam " livingroom war " and the revulsion it created . Obviously they admired and envied Margaret Thatcher 's dealing with the press during the Falklands invasion , when the Iron Lady 's government allowed only a small contingent of journalists along , under wraps . <P> It was quickly apparent that banning reporters-and later giving them only a few quick guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speculation and rumor take over . Several days after the invasion there was still determined resistance here and there , but no one knew how much , how serious or by whom . The result was vague and nagging alarm , a suspicion that the world 's largest military power had trouble subduing a flyspeck island . However that impression might be dispelled later , some of the damage will linger . More important , the Administration 's case for the invasion rests increasingly on the assertion that the Cubans had been attempting to transform Grenada into a sort of island fortress . Eyewitness reports from correspondents might have made that claim quickly convincing . Their absence may cause the question to persist : What was the Administration trying to hide ?
