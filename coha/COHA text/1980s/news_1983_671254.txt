I have been hooked on the concept of satays since I first visited Bali and its environs a good many years ago . They are easy to prepare and are particularly good when cooked over charcoal . Ofhen , satays are served with a sauce made of ground peanuts or peanut butter , one of the noblest and most tempting uses of that product . The sauce is spicy and often a trifle sweet. // Satays can be made of almsot any sort of meat poultry or seafood ( such as shrimp ) . Ideally , I prefer to dine on an assortment of them prepared on separate skewers - for example , one of chicken , one of beef , one of lamb and so on. // To be altogether pure in the preparation of satays , one should use several exotic spices and herbs such as lemon grass , shrimp paste and leaves such as those called salam and lime . These are rare , though available , in this country . With a few modifications , however , enormously tempting satays can be turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coriander , turmeric , etc. // The one sauce that can be found with relatively small effort is called ketjap manis and is available in many shops that specialize in Asian foods . It adds a good deal to the marinades of certain satays . If it is not to be found , one may substitute a dark soy sauce , blended with an equl volume of sugar , a touch of water and a couple of crushed garlic cloves. // If these recipes whet one ' s appetite for more Indonesian cooking , I strongly recomend " The Indonesian Kitchen " ( Atheneum , 1961 ) by Copeland Marks with Mintari Soeharjo .
