The Post has for some months been hearing a rustling among the grass roots in the land . It centers on an unusual man  --  a broadcaster , a lawyer , an economist , a theologian , a businessman  --  named Pat Robertson , the president of a burgeoning communications-education complex grouped around the Christian Broadcasting Network . The rustling  --  gentle but persistent  --  usually takes the form of a question , or perhaps two questions run together . They go something like this : " What is Pat Robertson going to do next ? Do you think he 'll one day run for president ? " The Post found that , often , the questions pop up in discussions about successors to Ronald Reagan . Furthermore , the Post found that the questioners are serious . To learn more about the substance of this rustling and about the man himself , we talked with a number of influential people who know him well , from Maine to California , Democrats , Republicans and independents alike . " I give Pat Robertson high marks in a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic kingmaker in his home state of Georgia and a man of considerable national clout since his days with the Carter administration . " I think he 's a fine , fine individual . " Lance was particularly struck by the importance of communications and television today , which he felt would he a plus for Robertson if he were to try his hand at presidential politics . " Something awfully important has happened , " he said . " One reason that political parties are n't as functional now as they used to be is that they have lost a very basic element . . . the control of the flow of information to the party members . This information used to go through the precinct organization and up and down through the state organization and so on . Well , they 've lost that . It is now controlled by the media and by the Congressmen , writing their own constituencies . " The same thing has happened to the labor unions . The unions made sure that you got your information through the union . When they lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one group in the country that controls the flow of information to its constituency is the television evangelicals . " Television is the media today and affects the political process . You have to be good on television in order to be elected . That 's where we are . There 's a lot of people who would vote for him Robertson , and you know he 's from the right part of the country ( Virginia ) . It 's all very interesting . I would n't be surprised if you 'd find positive feedback about him . " Sam Moore , chief executive officer of the Thomas Nelson publishing empire , including Dodd , Mead of New York , was enthusiastic . " He 'd make a fantastic President ! He 's a godly man , a smart man , a good businessman , an attorney , and has enough experience to run any business or any facet of the country . He knows how to get things done , and he 's a man of integrity , too . He can have my vote any day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve and a professor of economics at Harvard , agreed . " I would vote for him , " he said . He was especially keen on Robertson 's television abilities as reflected on the " 700 Club " news-magazine show . But , he said , " He is a lot of other things , too . He is an extraordinary man . " His major reservation , it appeared , was Robertson 's openness regarding his faith . He concluded , however : " I am the kind of person who can swallow all that religion when I see his understanding of economics . " Paul Weyrich , one of Washington 's leading conservative movers and shakers , was quick to verify the rustling the Post had picked up . " There is literally a grass-roots movement to make this happen , " he said , " which Pat has not shown any inclination to abet . If I thought Pat would n't repudiate it , I 'd lead a draft movement . " He explained his enthusiasm this way : " I 've never seen so much unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't agree on a candidate . When his name was mentioned , there was just an extraordinary unity , because , first of all , Pat represents the values that I think are shared by a majority of Americans , and he lives those values . Secondly , being the son of a United States senator the late A.W . Robertson of Virginia , he has a good understanding of how things work . Thirdly , he has an extraordinary personality , attractive to millions and millions of people . He presents sound views in a nonthreatening manner , which I think is essential . " Weyrich concluded : " Among potential candidates today , political or nonpolitical , there is no one with a higher rating in education , experience , family background , name recognition , popularity and vigor , " Another Democrat , Woody Jenkins of Louisiana , a legislator and a publisher , was especially thoughtful in his assessment of Robertson and his multiple talents . " I think he has some unique characteristics that would make him a very formidable candidate , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to run in the primaries , and to do so in a very short period of time . Second , he would have a ready-made organization all over America and , of course , that 's particularly important in the key primary states . He would have legions ready to work wherever they were needed . Third , he has tremendous name recognition . Fourth , he is probably one of the two greatest communicators in America today on television ; the other one is Ronald Reagan . " And , of course , he has the educational background . His knowledge of public affairs , the fact that he comments on it every day , really makes him one of the most knowledgeable candidates in history . " The negative thing to overcome is the question of whether a religious man , known as a religious leader , can be elected . Would the media attempt to discredit him be-cause he is known as a religious leader ? " Acknowledging the dimension of religion , a Madison Avenue advertising executive , Tom Dunkerton , pointed quickly to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows all the facts and figures . He knows how to deal with tough cookies , if you will , when to speak out and when to keep quiet . And he has a keen sense of humor . " We could n't ignore Indiana , where politics is a way of life . So we asked Beurt SerVaas , an industrialist-scientist who has for many years been the president of the Indianapolis City-County Council , what he thought : " Well , " he said , " President Eisenhower , before his election , was a nonpolitician , general , educator president of Columbia University and immensely popular with millions of people . He was asked by both parties to be their presidential candidate , and he chose the Republicans . He could have chosen the Democrats . Both parties wanted him . " Pat Robertson is somewhat in the same boat . You can not govern in this country unless you are popular , but you must have shown somewhere in your career that you can deal with complex organizations as well as with individual people , handle technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get things done . " So , there is no question but that Pat Robertson is presidential timber , a businessman , minister , lawyer , Marine Corps officer , boxer , Phi Beta Kappa , a popular communicator like Reagan and an organizer like Eisenhower . " I 'll say this ! If Pat Robertson were a candidate for president , I would not want to be running against him . " One of the country 's most successful businessmen , Joseph Coors of Colorado , a strong conservative , said that Robertson 's communication strengths would overpower potential criticism regarding religion . " Pat 's no neophyte on the political scene , " he said , " although he has n't been active himself in that field . He 's never run for office , to the best of my knowledge , but I think he would just be an outstanding potential candidate , with really no scars or no negatives with which people could tear him apart . " Coors obviously thought that such a political move by the CBN founder would be controversial . " It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would raise a lot of eyebrows . " He went on to give his opinion of Robertson ; " He has many wonderful traits that qualify him . He 's an outstanding person , attractive ; he speaks beautifully with tremendous emphasis ; and as a result of his speaking abilities he 's very persuasive and would make an excellent candidate from that point of view . His personality is just beaming and outstanding . Besides , he is a very intelligent person and has a great background in education and , actually , in the political scene , through the exposure that he had during his father 's tenure . " A woman close to the inner workings of national government , Dee Jensen , a former White House aide , believes Robertson would be a serious contender should he seek the presidency . " I have a great deal of admiration and respect for Pat Robertson , his intellect and his ability , " she said . " He 's very well informed and very knowledgeable about many , many different things in this country and in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek public office , he would certainly have a broad base of support . " Several Virginians who have watched Robertson up close gave him high marks . Sen. John Warner , a Republican , said , " Pat Robertson is a man whose wisdom and compassion today reflect the richness of the teachings of a devout mother and a brilliant father . It 's been my privilege to know his family and share a friendship with Pat since we entered Washington and Lee University nearly four decades ago . " Rep. William Whitehurst , also a Republican , recalls , " I 've known Pat since before I came to Congress , and that was back in 1968 . Thus I knew him when his operation was considerably smaller than it is now . He 's one of our great assets in the Virginia Tidewater . Not only there , but I think he 's an asset to the countries he has reached out to , and more especially the many , many people he has touched with his ministry . He 's been an asset and a blessing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy , Whitehurst said , " I think he 'd be super , but if he did a thing like that , I 'd think he 'd lost his mind . " He added that he believed Robertson has the ability and the intelligence necessary to be President . " But just being smart is n't enough , " he said . " And wanting the job is n't enough . But if he were interested , then certainly he should make his interest known , and , indeed , his supporters in either party should prepare the way for it . It 's not just going to be done by acclamation . " Conoly Phillips , a businessman and one-time Democratic Senate candidate , emphasized the broadcaster 's younger life . " Being brought up in a political family , he knows more about politics than most politicians . His dad , whom I knew , was head of the Senate Finance Committee . Pat knows domestic finance , he knows international finance . There 's no question in my mind that Pat has the ability  --  he has everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd surely get my vote . " A Time to Confront The pattern was clear : first , the rustling at the grass roots ; then , the enthusiasm of a significant number of influential leaders . That left the subject himself . What did Pat Robertson think about his one day running for the presidency ? We flew into lively , booming Virginia Beach for a confrontation with this man of many reputed talents . During the flight , the question seemed increasingly far-out , even off-the-wall . After all , I 'd told myself , he 's never run for anything . Yes , he 's smart ; he 's attractive ; yes , he runs a close race with Ronald Reagan as the great communicator . Yes , he 's done just about everything there is to do  --  with great success . But being descended from the Harrison family that next for Pat Robertson ? Do you think you 'll ever run for president of the United States ? " The broadcaster broke into laughter . Obviously the questions caught him by surprise , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien to him . It had been around before . Turning serious , Robertson responded : " Of course , I 've heard of the rumor before . I do n't live in a vacuum . But I 've never taken it seriously . " His expression quickened again . " Good heavens , I 've got the best job in the world right now . I would be crazy to want to change it . I enjoy what I do  --  I love itl  --  and on top of that , I 'm serving the Lord . " The seriousness deepened . " Of course , you always have to consider what the Lord wants . If He were to say , ' Run for president , ' then obviously any man of God would have to obey . The whole thing would depend produced two American presidents , or being the son of a strong senator , or even being distantly related to that most powerful of English-speaking politicians , Winston Churchill , does n't mean he 's a politician . Seated comfortably in his deep-brown office on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's on what He wanted . " The smile returned quickly . " But right now , I 'm having a lot of fun . " A Look at the Man One of the most immediate bits of information to become clear during the interview at his massive international communications center is related to Robertson 's personality . Millions of viewers and readers have " met " this man by way of his burgeoning Christian Broadcasting Network and his five highly acclaimed books . Still other thousands have been stirred by his powerful speechmaking at rallies and conferences around the world . But the tube is indifferent , the type cold , and the public-address systems are sterile in contrast to the warmth and good humor of a man who daily carries a remarkable diversity of responsibilities on his broad shoulders . He seems able to set aside multimillion-dollar issues and move to other matters with ease . He deals directly with numerous top executives on questions ranging from TV production to book publishing to fund raising . And he does a 90-minute live television program five days a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , he laughs quickly  --  frequently at himself . As the various political figures noted when interviewed , Robertson comes from a long line of socially responsible and politically active people . His ancestral lines can be traced back to the presidents William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison and to Churchill . More directly , his father , A. Willis , was one of the century 's most powerful Virginia politicians , having been chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , and his grandfather was a hard-working Baptist minister . Pat himself was born near Lexington , in a region that has long taken its national responsibilities seriously . Following four years at Washington and Lee University , where he was a junior Phi Beta Kappa , he graduated magna cum laude , entered the Marine Corps and served in the Korean War as a lieutenant . Then came a jurisdoctorate at the prestigious Yale Law School and a trek into New York City " to make my fortune . " A budding career in business  --  including the W.R. Grace &; Co , in Manhattan and a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than God Himself . Pat , raised in a Christian environment but lacking a personal experience with the Lord , underwent a conversion that was to alter the course of his life . The first order of business after the turnabout was a return to school to earn a master of divinity degree from the New York Theological Seminary and then to minister in the ghetto of Brooklyn 's Bedford-Stuyvesant district . Perhaps one preparation for such an intimidating ministry was Pat 's experience as a Golden Gloves boxer , a role that his colleagues today still have trouble fitting into his unusual background . " It 's hard to think of Pat whaling away at somebody in the boxing ring , " said one company executive . " He spends most of his time praying for peoplethese days . " Undeterred by doubters , he fought in the novice heavyweight division , at 185 pounds , making it all the way to the finals . " I got a TKO in the semifinals because my opponent was out of shape , " he confides . " I hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a smile , he adds , " But I lost in the finals . " One easily reaches the conclusion that Dr. Marion Gordon ( Pat ) Robertson has not lost a decision since . However , the outlook was not particularly bright the day in 1959 when he , his wife and their three children set out , much like the early pioneers , from Brooklyn bound for the Virginia Tidewater to launch a television ministry . Other than faith , their assets consisted of an old car and $70 . But they were convinced that " nowhere was Christian influence needed more than in the television in-dustry , " which was bursting into American life with un-precedented power . So , with a miracle here and a miracle continued on page /06 Pat Robertson continued from page 56 there , Robertson bought a dilapidated UHF station and eventually got it on the air  --  launching the first phase of a story that led to the multifaceted outreach of CBN . The Scope of CBN Today the Christian Broadcasting Network is the umbrella for the following components @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third ( depending on when one counts ) largest satellite-to-cable service in America , more than 30 million households being wired in . That translates into a potential audience of 70 million . ? A daily , 90-minute news-magazine program , " The 700 Club , " that is carried on more than 190 television stations in this country and abroad , as well as on the cable network . ? A fully accredited graduate university offering degree programs in five schools plus an institute of journalism . ? Three owned-and-operated television stations in Dallas , Boston , and the Virginia Tidewater , plus a radio station in Tidewater . ? A major television station situated in southern Lebanon and serving the nations of the Middle East . ? Specially adapted programing currently broadcast in 60 countries , including mainland China . ? Telephone  --  counseling centers in 60 American and 25 foreign cities . ? The Freedom Council , with grass-roots involvement around the country , designed to help protect religious liberty . A Surprise to All Who could have envisioned such growth at the time of CBN 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UHF station housed in a run-down garage in Portsmouth , Virginia ? Not Pat Robertson . " I never dreamed we would do anything like this , " he said with a smile . The dramatic expansion caused one media observer to calculate that CBN , with the cable network alone , reaches more people every week than Time , Newsweek , the Washington Post , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago continued on page 108 Pat Robertson continued from page 106 Tribune combined . A man who has accomplished so much is predictably very busy . We asked about his daily schedule . The answer came quickly . many talents . She lectures . She writes . And , more than anything else  --  says her husband ? " She is a housewife . " And the Four Children " The youngest is now 21 , the oldest is 30 . He is a group vice president of CBN , in charge of our cable network . A daughter lives in Dallas , Texas . Our third child is a lawyer in Norfolk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who just graduated from college , is planning to get Pat 's Schedule " I get up somewhere between 5:00 and 6:00 and spend an hour or so studying the Bible and praying . Then , I work on the format for my morning show and study the material I have to be dealing with . After that , I try to get out and run a mile or two . Then I may have some letters or memos to write . About 9:00 or 9:15 , we go in for make-up and review of the clips . We have news pieces and all the items of the day that we 'll be doing on the show . We do the show live at 10 o'clock . After 11:30 , from time to time I have foreign programs for which I do some insert pieces . At 12 noon , we have a prayer meeting for the entire staff . Sometimes on Fridays , I lead the whole thing for 600 or 700 people ; otherwise I 'm just a participant . At 12:30 , I usually have a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 've been concerned . Yesterday , it was to plan with architects and builders for a new conference center . I get away from here sometimes by 7:00 at night , sometimes 6:30 , once in a while by 6:00 . But , there are many times when my night work goes home with me , " he said . Although work alone might keep him in boxing trim , Pat Robertson takes no chances . Besides his usual morning run and a game of tennis whenever time permits it , he says he has changed to a low-fat diet that includes mostly chicken and fish , grains , fruits and vegetables . Supposedly , behind every successful man there is a woman . In rare cases the woman is n't behind him , she 's right alongside . To hear this successful man tell about the woman who struggled with him when the going was tough , there is no doubt that theirs is a side-by-side relationship . Also a graduate of Yale , with a master 's degree in nursing , Dede Robertson was appointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Organization of the Organization of American States . She has Agenda continued tax law , through allowable deductions , fosters both individual and corporate debt . No reason or necessity exists to do so . If we cut out all the loopholes , Congress could set up a flat tax rate , much as is being discussed currently . A flat tax would free the creative energies of our people for increased economic productivity instead of tax avoidance . A Solid Social Security System One of the trends we are clearly experiencing is the graying of America . I am a grandfather now ; this is the time one begins to think of those wonderful years ahead . But many people will have limited financial means available in their future . When Social Security started out , it was supposed to be a supplement to private pension plans . Initially , about 70 workers supported every retiree . Now about 3 workers support every retiree . By approximately the year 2010 , 2 workers will support every retiree . Before long , these young workers burdened by extraordinarily high Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandpa , it 's been fun , but no more . " It used to be willingly believed by many Americans that a trust fund was set up for Social Security payments . There is no trust fund . The money paid in annually for Social Security goes directly into the payment of old-age benefits and Medicare payments for the elderly . There is no actuarial reality whatsoever to Social Security . To fund the current program properly would take 61/2 to 7 trillion dollars . This unfunded liability is five times the current national debt and is the greatest hidden debt in America . It is also a ticking time bomb . Recently , Congress has raised the Social Secur taxes , incorporated more workers in the system ( now including congressional employees ) and raised the minimum salary to about $35,000 . Increases are anticipated annually . Would n't it be wonderful if we took all that money that goes into Social Security and invested it properly with insurance companies , banks , private business and private enterprise ? In a ten-year period these private pension funds could invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , new equipment , research and development and so forth . This investment would be the biggest economic shot in the arm this country could have , an incredible opportunity to rebuild America . People would know that when they retired they would have something . A private pension plan could provide that a person investing the equivalent of currently envisioned Social Security payments beginning when he was 30 years old and earning about $20,000 annually would retire with half a million dollars or more that would belong to him only . It would be his money . In contrast , we do not have any money with Social Security ; we have no guarantee whatsoever that when the time comes to retire , we will receive adequate income . This problem will increase as more and more people , especially from the aging of the baby boom , retire . Without drastically increased taxes , the Treasury will not have enough money to pay them the promised retirement benefits millions of individuals are expecting . But we must face this problem ; hard decisions must be made , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of summer . So , they 're all grown up . " In addition to his wife and family , his many fruitful endeavors , his numerous honors , citations and awards , what so far in his career has given Pat Robertson the most satis-faction ? " We have something now called Operation Blessing . Last year we fed , clothed , housed and assisted probably between 4 and 5 million poor people in the United States and 5 million more overseas . Of all the things that bring satisfaction , the most satisfying is to help people who have needs materially and to help those who have needs spiritually . To see the joy in their faces and to know their gratitude has to top the list ! " sound system is one decision that would make a tremendous start . Federal Courts and Judicial Policy We must see a new policy of the judiciary and the federal court system of America . Thomas Jefferson said that if in matters of the Constitution the Supreme Court were the sole arbiter of what is constitutional , then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And precisely that has happened . In one of the more " liberal " law schools , the concept is taught that social change can not be brought about through the political process , but it can be brought about by a small minority working through the courts . These schools teach that liberal judges frame issues in their way , select their jurisdiction and begin a body of law that would ultimately change our society without the changes ever being approved by the voters . And that is what has been done . For example , federal judges in Boston said , in essence : We are going to take over the school system , and we are going to tell the city council it must appropriate funds to send buses into certain parts of the city , and if not , we will hold the elected officials in contempt of court . Now , these federal judges are not accountable to the voters . Three judges on the U.S. Supreme Court are moving along in years . Perhaps one of the most profound changes that Ronald Reagan could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprimatur on the U.S. Supreme Court that would last well past the year 2000 . Replacing retiring justices is probably the greatest opportunity to refocus judicial policy in our lifetime . A newjudicial policy could change the court 's abortion policy . It could reverse the incredible interpretation of the **25;4746;TOOLONG clause in our Constitution . Also in need of change are decisions on school prayer , forced busing , criminal jurisdiction , the exclusionary rule and others . These decisions could be reversed with just the appointment of a couple more judges . President Reagan will have that privilege , I believe , in the next four years . But we must insist on men and women of good will and judicial character who are traditional in their values and who believe in the historic interpretation of the Constitution . New Morality in Education We are going to see a new morality in education . You can not educate children in a moral vacuum . There is no way that you can teach without teaching some system of moral values . If you do not teach the Judeo-Christian or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach humanism or atheism . There is no alternative . The humanists have not only declared that they are going to triumph over the rotting corpse of Christianity , but that humanist teachers will become activists in proclaiming their values in the classroom . We can not allow that to happen . The time has come when Americans need to become much more involved in schools , in school boards and in the decisions of the boards or councils of education in each state . It is absolutely imperative for the future of our nation that young men and young women be trained in the principles of the whole Bible , in the principles that undergird our freedoms as a nation , in the historiccontinuity of our country and in the fundamental values that have made this nation great . If we fail to do that , the next several generations will face a bleak future . A Bright Future I believe that the next few years will be the most exciting period this nation has ever known . Unbelievable opportunities lie before us . In some instances , opportunity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialist systems , the humanist educational schemes , the jerry-built international banking systems , to name a few . There will be some pain and suffering , but the opportunity to build a new solid foundation is before us . Nobody has any conception of what a wonderful place this nation , this world can be if we take the opportunity that is ours . I recall the Chinese fable about a young man who came to see a philosopher and said , " Old man , you 're a teacher . You are supposed to be so wise . You know everything . " Then he said , " I have a bird in my hand . " He held it up and asked , " Tell me , old man , is this bird alive or dead ? " ? much as you might look at our country in pessimistic moods and say , " Is this nation alive or dead ? " The teacher looked at the young man for a moment or two . He realized that the youth had in his hand a live bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead . So he answered , " Young man , as thou wilt , as thou wilt . " For those of us in a position of leadership , the answer is , " As we will . " With God 's help , we can see the next 4 , 8 or 12 years to be absolutely incredible opportunities for our society and our world .
