The kids have been clamoring for something more exciting than the perennial , **50;29117;TOOLONG holiday . And visions of last year ' s cinematic satire , " Vacation , " linger in your mind : flat tires , munched fenders , and hubcap thieves. // This **28;29169; Could <> just by your family ' s year for island breezes , palm trees , and pristine beaches. // Airlines have chiseled down United States-to-Caribbean fares , as tantalizing ads in everything from Newsweek to Boy ' s Life make plain . But what will you find ? How much will it cost Are there enough alternatives to keep Mom , Dad , and juniors alternately relaxed , busy , and happy ? // I ' ve just taken whirlwind tours of each of the US Virgin Islands  --  with time out , of course , to sample the golf , sailing , scuba diving , shopping , and sightseeing . I looked for specific family accommodations , specially priced packages , self-contained , efficiency condominiums , cabins , and the like . And I returned with plenty of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good news is , at the very least , threefold : ( 1 ) the three US Virgin Islands have a dizzying array of accommodations in all sizes , styles , prices , and locations ( prices range roughly from Rockefeller-owned Caneel Bay ' s plush triple rooms at $510 per day to Maho Bay Campground ' s three-room hillside tents at $50 per night , plus $10 per for each occupant over two ) ; ( 2 ) there is an island to delight each person ' s taste : St. Thomas has the most highly developed resorts , discos , and duty-free shopping opportunities  --  and the most tourists ; St. John , two-thirds national park , is almost the opposite of St. Thomas in development , number of visitors , lack of stores ; and St. Croix is a good mixture of both , with more wide open spaces and privacy than St. Thomas , but not nearly as undeveloped as St. John ; ( 3 ) there is plenty to occupy a family of all ages for well over two weeks. // All three islands have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on both hands . St. Thomas and St. Croix have world-class golf courses , St. Croix one of the best snorkeling/scuba reefs in the world , and St. John rates high for first-class tropical seclusion . St. Thomas is probably the best Caribbean source for duty-free cameras , crystal , perfume , jewelry , cameras , and electronics  --  not to mention restaurants . The list of attractions is endless. // On the negative side , not many hotels have special family packages  --  either reduced prices or extended stays . Many , such as Caneel Bay , consider themselves " couple " resorts , with rates and activities geared toward honeymooners . Some don ' t allow children under 3 and discourage bringing children under 8 ( exceptions are discussed below ) . // In general , your travel agent can help you find just the hotel you are looking for , with appropriate rates and locatin . I find Fielding ' s " Caribbean 1984 , " by Margaret Zellers , worth 10 times its $12. 95 cover price . It leads you to the right restaurants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. // Tourism and water sports are the islands ' stock in trade , so you ' d almost have to wear blinders to avoid the many tantalizing sail excursions ( trimaran , catamaran ) , island nature tours , even horse-back-riding packages available . Activity centers in all the hotels can help you rent the Sun Fish , snorkel gear , sail-surfboard , or scuba gear you want . If they don ' t have your particular rental item , they can help arrange its delivery , or your transportation to it. // The more I stuck to my " family vacation " motif , I was led to places with self-contained , efficiency units  --  with kitchenettes that included small stoves , cupboards , and refrigerators : Here families can save enormously by preparing their own meals . Many bring canned food  --  from peanut butter to tuna fish  --  from home , as even supermarket-purchased food in the Caribbean islands , all shipped from the mainland , is costly. // The other appeal of these family units is that they provide a home base for all island activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend time game-playing , reading , and pursuing hobbies . And when togetherness gets out of hand , there ' s an activity for everyone : tours of abandoned sugar mills , nature walks that teach you the flora and fauna , biking , mopeds , and jeep rentals. // Although I obviously couldn ' t even come close to seeing everything the islands had to offer , here are suggestions from the places I visited : <> <> Campgrounds : // Cinnamon Bay and Maho Bay , on St. John , head my list , because I ' d forgotten how appealing submergence in a tropical island environment can be : cricket and bird sounds , leaves rustling , banana quits that flit onto the veranda in the morning . Camping is also the cheapest. // Maho Bay is the more remote of the two and has more to offer  --  with three-room canvas cottages overlooking the bay from sequestered hill sites . A wooden boardwalk connects restrooms , camp store , and beach . All units have wooden floors , verandas , and electricity . A kitchen area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pans. // Clinnamon Bay is on National Park land and has three offerings : efficiency units on cement blocks ( which I found unappealing ) , sites with tents , and bare sites . Trails with sand as white and fluffy as flour lead around the sites . These are just steps from a beach National Geographic has labeled one of the world ' s 10 most beautiful . <> <> Hotels : // Of all the accommodations I saw on St. Croix , I ' ll mention three as indicative of family options : // The Buccaneer is first because it has a cFamily in Paradise " package in which two adults can bring up to three children free ( price is $650 weekly , European plan ) . Manager Nancy Manyak told me the hotel doesn ' t really like to have children under 3 , but has provided a game room with pool table , video games , and pinball and some help with baby sitting for parents who want to explore the night life without their children . Since the hotel caters to families , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children to play with. // I met one family of seven touring the entire Caribbean . They opted for the Grape Tree Beach Hotel , on the windy side of the island . Their rationale : Grape Tree hotel rooms are right on the beach where parents can watch their children from the rooms. // Last is Queen ' s Quarters , on a hill in the geographic center of the island ( exactly 7 miles from each shore ) . Although there is no beachfront , these attractive studio and one- , two- , and three-room units are closer to more island options : golf at the Robert Trent Jones-designed Fountain Valley Golf Course ; snorkeling at Buck Island reef , considered to major location in the world ; and other attractions . <> <> Condominiums : // Mahogany Run is perhaps best known as a world-famous golf course on St. Thomas , but it ' s also the name of a whole resort that includes cliffside villa condominiums on the north side of the island . These are reasonable in price ( although they have only indirect beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side on St. Croix , Mill Harbour , Colony Cove , Sugar Beach , each with comparable rooms and good records of returning guests . Sugar Beach has all rooms directly on the beach , and Colony Cove , the newest , has no restaurant of its own and its beach is man-made . ( These are things you can ' t quite tell from the brochures , but even so I ' d recommend sending for them before renting . ) Ask plenty of questions before you rent a condo : How far from the beach ? ( Not just the " water , " as at some it can be close but not accessible . ) What kind of access to the beach ? Which direction do the rooms face ? ( Don ' t get stuck in a seaside condo with a view out the back . ) Does the pool have salt water or fresh ? Is there an additional fee for more people ? Some places officially state " no more than four , " but some managers told me enforcement is lax . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toured , Tomarind Reef Beach Club , on St. Croix , struck me as the most appealing . Special family units are more spacious and have better furniture , access to two kinds of beach ( one protected , one with more waves ) , both screened-in and glassed-in areas , and private verandas . It has its own beautiful pool and is only a 10-minute drive from Christiansted . For contrast , just up the coast is Chenay Bay Colony , whose cottage units are somewhat removed from the beach in more of a community setting . They specialize in providing water-oriented activities and have an ideal sailsurfing bay . Manager Larry Bathon told me guests frequently become friends and plan future vacations together. // //
