A pardon from the Pontiff , a lesson in forgiveness for a troubled world <P> Usually it is the images of the immediate aftermath that are imprinted on the mind , the fragments of a normality shattered just a moment ago . The smoke from the bomb has scarcely cleared . Bodies on stretchers are jounced frantically toward the ambulances , and an arm waves at the camera to clear the way . Plaster clouds and torn clothes everywhere , the neighborhood blown out of its shoes . All in the same viewfinder : rescuers scramble in the chaos , a mother screams as if in Guernica , the stunned survivors move off with a slow , blank stare . The dead lie abruptly motionless wherever the latest outrage has deposited them . <P> Spectacles of terror and revenge occur so regularly that they seem to be scheduled into the routines of the world . They have become a way we punctuate our time . History unfolds as a sequence of detonations , a portion of the nightly news given over to psychosis . The scenes define a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ski mask , violence dramatizing an unappeasable rage . Faceless , and morally depthless , the zealots crash truck bombs into their targets in Beirut or Tyre , go night riding with the Salvadoran death squads , or set the timers for the I.R.A . One sees their work-the almost daily deposits of bodies in the roads of Central America , for example . Or , in London , the innocent blown up to make an awful noise for Irish unity-horses of the Queen 's Household Cavalry blasted while on parade , or Christmas shoppers at Harrods department store . <P> The memory keeps one picture in particular : St. Peter 's Square in May 1981 . It shows Pope John Paul II in white robes , capsized backward on his seat , stricken , in a posture vaguely reminiscent of the Piet . There is an adrenal burst of motion in the scene as the security men spring alive and the Pontiff 's white Popemobile lurches off through the crowd . <P> Ordinarily , the spasm of savagery simply passes and recedes in time , an ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of grace , the violence in St. Peter 's Square was transformed . In a bare , white-walled cell in Rome 's Rebibbia prison , John Paul tenderly held the hand that had held the gun that was meant to kill him ( see cover ) . For 21 minutes , the Pope sat with his would-be assassin , Mehmet Ah Agca . The two talked softly . Once or twice , Agca laughed . The Pope forgave him for the shooting . At the end of the meeting , Agca either kissed the Pope 's ring or pressed the Pope 's hand to his forehead in a Muslim gesture of respect . <P> It was a startling drama of forgiveness and reconciliation . On one level , it was an intensely intimate transaction between two men . But if the Pope spoke in whispers , he also meant to proclaim a message to the world . The only other people in the cell with Agca and John Paul were the Pope 's personal secretary , two security agents-and a Vatican photographer and television crew . The Roman Catholic Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express its spiritual meanings . The Pope brought the photographer and the cameramen because he wanted the image in that cell to be shown around a world filled with nuclear arsenals and unforgiving hatreds , with hostile superpowers and smaller , implacable fanaticisms.
