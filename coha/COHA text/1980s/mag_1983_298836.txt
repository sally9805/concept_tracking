He first appeared as the lusty Greek peasant in the 1964 film , which earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor . Now , 19 years later , Anthony Quinn , 68 , is once again playing Zorba , this time in the flesh . Looking a little older and maybe even wiser , Quinn this week opens in a Broadway revival of a 1968 musical version , which originally starred Herschel Bernard ! . The intervening years have hardly mellowed the Mexican-born Quinn 's old-fashioned machismo . " Men do n't know where they are with this women 's liberation , " he says . " I do n't see many men today . I see a lot of guys running around television with small waists . But I do n't see many men . " Is Quinn still man enough to play the feisty Zorba ? Boasts he : " Today I 'm a better Zorba . Before , I had to paint my hair white . Now I 'm just right . " <P> <P> It was not exactly your standard duet on last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson , the crusty country and western singer , sharing the stage-and microphone-with Julio Iglesias , the Latin crooner who does not serenade his multinational audiences in a good ole boy 's drawl . The unusual pairing came about after Nelson heard about Iglesias during a visit to London . The two got together to record the oldie As Time Goes By for Nelson 's next album , and for Iglesias ' next LP they did To All the Girls I 've Loved Before , which they sang together on the televised awards show . Who knows ? They might even win one of the awards next time . Nelson did in fact win Vocal Duo of the Year last week . But paired with a more certified country boy , Merle Haggard . <P> <P> The 20 billboards around Nottinghamshire , England , were certainly attention grabbers . They asserted that Ronald Reagan has " never had a pint of Mansfield . " That was true enough . The President had never even heard of the small , 150-year-old local brew . The ad , with its crafty nonendorsement endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansfield Marketing Director Richard Lewis . The brewery was careful , however , not to provoke the White House , which voiced no objections because the picture was in the public domain . But Lewis piously protests he would never take similar advantage of a British politician . The U.S. Chief Executive was chosen , he says , because " we do n't think a picture of President Reagan in Nottinghamshire is going to affect the outcome of the next presidential election . " Hmm . Even now the wheels may be turning at some U.S. brewery . " She may have recaptured the Falklands , but she 's never hoisted a. . . "
