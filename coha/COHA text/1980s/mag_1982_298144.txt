A struggling black medical college gets some federal medicine <P> Over the past century , Meharry Medical College in Nashville has trained 40% of the nation 's practicing black doctors and dentists , most of whom have provided health care to the poor . Yet despite this vital contribution , Meharry has been struggling lately to maintain its mission , and even its existence . Over the past decade , the nation 's larger and better-known medical schools have adopted affirmative-action admissions policies that have siphoned off some of Meharry 's best talent . Hubbard Hospital , Meharry 's teaching facility , has been running into heavy debt . Meharry students have not enjoyed access to residencies at two tax-supported Nashville hospitals-a situation attributable to a number of factors , including some community practices and institutional arrangements surviving unexamined from the racist past . <P> Last year Meharry 's woes came to a dramatic head . The American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges threatened to put Meharry on probation as an accredited school , primarily criticizing the lack of clinical teaching beds for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements as recommended , but had little success in increasing student access to patients . As a result , last month the probation threat stood , bringing the historic school uncomfortably closer to being out of business . <P> But help was already on the way . Responding to the recommendations of a White House task force , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intervened . In addition to promising to pay off Meharry 's $29 million construction loan for Hubbard Hospital , HHS pointedly instructed the U.S. Veterans Administration to expand an affiliation between at least one of the large VA medical centers in the Nashville area and Meharry . Said HHS Secretary Richard Schweiker , in explaining his department 's intervention : " Many of Meharry 's students have come from disadvantaged economic backgrounds . Its graduates have established a strong record of practicing primary-care medical specialties where they are desperately needed . " Federal aid to Meharry follows logically from the Executive order the President signed last September pledging federal support for black institutions of higher learning . <P> Schweiker 's intervention could make the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VA hospital , in Murfreesboro , Tenn. , 30 miles from Nashville . Contracts for medical staffing of the Nashville VA hospital have always automatically gone to Vanderbilt University , whose medical school did not graduate its first black M.D. until 1970 . ( This year 25 of its 418 students are members of minority groups . ) Although the VA had a nondiscrimination policy at the time of Vanderbilt 's first agreement with the Nashville VA in 1947 , exceptions based on " local custom " were used then to segregate black patients and shut out black doctors .
