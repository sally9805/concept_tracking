How Howard Baker holds a cantankerous Senate together <P> It was the night of Nov. 21 , and in one hour the Government would go out of business if the necessary appropriation bill was not passed . In the Senate cloakroom , Majority Leader Howard Baker was trying to put together enough votes for a continuing resolution that would keep programs funded through the fiscal year . Michigan Democrat Carl Levin , who objected to proposed increases for defense spending , threatened to filibuster . Ted Stevens of Alaska , the Republican whip , began shouting at Levin . When Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn tried to intercede , Stevens turned his wrath on him . The mild-mannered Nunn stalked away . <P> Amid the chaos , Baker quietly began rebuilding egos and bridges . He first went to Stevens and persuaded him to apologize to Nunn . The three of them then joined to calm Levin down . Baker was eventually able to forge a consensus : a compromise resolution to keep programs funded for four months was passed , 60 to 35 .

He and Reagan first became friends in 1976 , when the Californian was campaigning in Tennessee for the Republican nomination . Although Baker supported Gerald Ford , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grace note that Reagan remembered , and a relaxed relationship blossomed . <P> <P> The two men touch base at least two or three times a week-more often if events warrant . " My approach with the President is very straightforward and direct , " says Baker . " We communicate easily . " In order to salvage the Administration 's proposal to sell AW ACS radar planes to Saudi Arabia , Baker carefully choreographed the President 's lobbying effort , even deciding details like which Senators should ride together to and from the White House . A special telephone in Baker 's Capitol Hill hideaway-White House extension 806-gives him a direct line to the President . " I 've got one at home too , " says Baker with a smile . His other direct line to the White House is through Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada . Because of Laxalt 's close friendship with Reagan , some saw him as a potential rival to Baker as leader of the Senate .
