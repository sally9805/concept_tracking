As 100 candidates and their lawyers nervously paced outside its chambers , the court refused to hear appeals in 39 of 43 election-law cases , some of which involved half a dozen candidates each who had been dropped by the lower courts from the Sept. 9 primary ballot. // Many were disqualified on the basis of a 1985 Court of Appeals ruling that allowed a candidate to be eliminated if there were errors in the cover sheets - or summary of contents - that accompany designating petitions. // A host of forces - from old-line party officials to insurgent candidates , from editorials to citizen organizations - had urged the court to ease its reading of the law. // But today , Chief Judge Sol Wachtler interrupted an appeals argument to send his message loud and clear : " It ' s mystifying - absolutely mystifying - why the statute , which is so clear , and our decisions , which are so clear , are totally ignored . The court and the statute - that ' s not bad guidelines. " // The judge ' s statement came as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to blame each other for how the current chaotic situation came to be . Chief Judge Wachtler stressed that the court was following the law as enacted by the Legislature . But the Speaker of the Assembly , Stanley Fink , sent an emissary to the court to argue that the judges were going beyond the lawmakers ' intent and that they did not envision so severe a penalty for cover-sheet errors as removal from the ballot. // " It would be so much easier for us , " the Chief Judge said in open court , " if the Legislature would say something like , ' Cover sheets are no longer necessary . ' But the Legislature said , ' There shall be cover sheets . ' " <> <> Strong Language // " So many of the legislators , " he continued , in unusually strong language , " don ' t follow their own decrees and are off the ballot because of their own dictates , and then they complain. " // But Sheldon Silver , a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , pointed out that the election law does not set penalties for failure to comply. // " This is a court-ordered penalty , " Mr. Silver said , " and we ' re saying don ' t knock people off the ballot , limit the penalty. " // A bill that would have limited the penalty in some cases of cover-sheet error - it would have allowed the court to disqualify a percentage of petition signatures instead of throwing a candidate off the ballot - passed both houses of the Legislature this year . But it was not forwarded to the Governor at the request of the State Board of Elections , which argued that the bill would have been unfairly enacted in the middle of the primary season , affecting some candidates but not all. // More sweeping changes in the election law to reduce even further the number of cover-sheet disqualifications have been blocked by the Republican-controlled Senate . Governor Cuomo has refused requests from Mayor Koch and others to call a special session of the Legislature to deal with the problem for this election , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Repeatedly , Chief Judge Wachtler stressed today that hundreds of candidates had successfully met the requirements , and he expressed amazement that some candidates had been so careless when they knew petitions would be closely scrutinized. // But Paul Asofsky , an expert in election law , argued outside chambers that most candidates did not know that . He said the court ' s 1985 ruling was in an obscure case that drew little attention at the time and that was noticed this primary season only after candidates were being removed from the ballot. // " It ' s absurd , " Mr. Asofsky said . " Candidates are filing petitions the same way they have been doing it for years and years and years and years , and now they ' re told that ' s not the right way . " <> <> ' A Simple Thing ' // Several leading election lawyers said they thought this would be the last year there would be such confusion over cover sheets because , even if candidates had not heard of the 1985 ruling before , they certainly have now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the law - it ' s a simple thing to do , " said State Senator Martin Conner , a Brooklyn Democrat and one of the lawyers with a case before the court today . " So , in the future , people will know to comply and they ' ll do it. " // But talk of the future was of little consolation today to the candidates not on the ballot or to the officials trying to wind their way through the subtleties of court rulings and the election law . The extent of those subtleties was made clear in an argument before the court over the cover sheet of one designating petition that was shared by three candidates. // The cover sheet , for local races in Erie County , listed three candidates for three different offices . The Court of Appeals had ruled that the number of signatures for each candidate must be put next to his name . This cover sheet did not do that , and left it to one sentence at the bottom : " 18 , 065 signatures for the above mentioned candidates. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has yet to make a final ruling , whether that meant 18 , 065 signatures for each candidate , or a total of 18 , 065 for all three candidates combined . The candidates said they intended the signatures to apply to each of them. // Judge Judith S. Kaye asked the opposing lawyer if the petitions would be acceptable if the wording had been " 18 , 065 signatures for all of the above mentioned candidates. " // The lawyer , Mark Matthew Jasen , said : " If the court is going to be concerned with every word ' each ' or ' all ' or ' every , ' this court will be inundated with election cases from here to eternity. " // Chief Judge Wachtler responded , " So what else is new ? " //
