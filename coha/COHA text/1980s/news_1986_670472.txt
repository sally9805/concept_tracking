It did not explain , however , how candidates would be nominated or how any election campaign would be conducted. // " In order to promote democracy and in order to give the people the opportunity to select the candidates that they will be satisfied with , this time the election will have more candidates than slots available , " She Diqing , a deputy chairman of the standing committee of the Municipal People ' s Congress , said in a speech to the committee . <> <> Student Protests Banned // The announcement , which appeared in Beijing Daily , follows an official crackdown on the wave of student demonstrations that have swept across China demanding wider democracy . On Friday , the standing committee issued a set of rules that in effect banned any public protest by students in the capital. // Although some Chinese villages and townships have offered two candidates for a seat in the local legislature , the larger cities operate on a system of a single candidate selected by the local Communist Party , with the voters given no say on who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Beijing Daily hailed the new policy of having more than one candidate for each race in the capital as promoting greater democracy . The elections are to be held within six months . Beijing students erected two anti-Government posters , United Press International reported . One said the Communist Government is " in every respect identical " to " the most tyrannical feudal despotisms we ' ve had . " The other quoted Deputy Prime Minister Wan Li as saying , " Democracy can only be something which we can bestow on someone as a favor . " The large cities ' system of handpicking party candidates has been the root of at least one outburst of student protest . In Hefei , the capital of Anhui Province , students marched early this month to demand that they be allowed to choose candidates for the provincial People ' s Congress. // Apparently stung by charges of undemocratic behavior , the local government there postponed the election , rescheduling it for Sunday , to give the students time to field their own candidates .

" A lot of workers were late because of the demonstration . Some old and weak people , as well as some ill people , were waiting in the cold wind for several hours . The demonstrations made more than 3 , 000 people miss their trains.
