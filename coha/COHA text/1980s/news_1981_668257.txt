With baseball ' s boys of summer on strike , the Massachusetts House and Senate have been playing an exhausting extra-innings game of their own on the state budget . And the final score is likely to include a state tax increase . By most reckoning , arithmetic and political , there is little chance that the final state budget will be balanced anywhere but on paper . For that and several other reasons , including federal budget cuts and Proposition 2 1/2 , the Legislature may be staring at a $300 million to $600 million tax bill before year ' s end . Gov . Edward J. King , an accountant by training , has spent much of this week warning that the Legislature ' s final compromise state budget is likely to force a tax increase . Privately , legislative leaders have been winking in agreement . King , who fears new taxes perhaps more than he dreads the candidacy of Michael S. Dukakis , also has taken pains to place advance blame for new taxes on the Legislature . That tack , however , ignores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week when he said at one point that the House and Senate budget proposals will lay the " foundation " for a tax hike . The major reason for any new or increased state taxes will not be the imbalanced budget he may be forced to accept . Instead , they will be needed to offset lost federal revenue from the Reagan Administration budget cuts , cuts that King supports ; and to provide prospective relief when Proposition 2 1/2 ' s other shoe drops next July 1 . King ' s fiscal advisers have been suggesting that the Senate version of the proposed state budget may be as much as $250 million out of balance . Even if they are only half correct , there will be a $125 million problem . That shortfall could be compounded dramatically if the state is either unwilling or unable to go ahead with the full panoply of layoffs that added new local aid would appear to mandate . That deficit , as large as it may be , is still only a small part of a larger fiscal problem prompted by President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of becoming reality in the federal budget . By most estimates , the federal cuts will erase $200 million in federalfunds for programs in which the state shares half the costs . King and his administration and finance secretary , Edward T. Hanley , have already hoisted signals suggesting the state should abandon those programs . But the Legislature will resist strongly any full-scale retrenchment . That raises the possibility that $100 million in new state revenue will have to be raised to keep some of those programs afloat . Taken together , the federal cuts and a state budget out of balance suggest the need , on paper at least , for a $200 million to $300 million tax program . With officials at the state and local level concentrating on this year ' s state budget and local aid fight , 2 1/2 ' s second year of tax cuts have been all but ignored . The local tax cuts mandated by 2 1/2 for the fiscal year that starts next July 1 will be less painful than this year ' s . But they ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major cities , which by then will be in further fiscal distress from the impact of the Reagan cuts on municipal programs . More prosperous communities , immunized from 2 1/2 ' s cuts after a year ' s time , still will be clamoring for even more new local aid to offset the inflationary costs they will have been forced to eat because of 2 1/2 ' s restrictions on local tax growth . The size of the Year 2 local bailout ? Estimates vary widely now . But there is little doubt that it will be demanded , perhaps to the tune of another $200 million to $300 million . All told , the cost of the fiscal problems on the state ' s horizon are staggering , particularly for a governor who daily asserts his opposition to any new taxes and who will have to face the voters next year . There is , of course , an alternative to new taxes : still deeper cuts in the state bureaucracy . But , after this year ' s round of cuts , there may be little stomach for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers will have decided before too long that their tax savings were not worth the aggravation of the service cuts and political turmoil that has surrounded them . For King , the issue is pivotal to his chances for re-election , which few politicians believe are good to begin with . Governors , as Dukakis discovered in 1975 , are blamed for tax increases during their terms whether or not they are truly the culprits . King , for instance , is fond of saying that Dukakis brought on the biggest tax increase in state history in 1975 . But even King knows that it was Gov . Francis W. Sargent ' s leftover deficit , and not Dukakis , that forced new taxes that year . Dukakis , of course , had offered the voters his " lead pipe guarantee " of no new taxes . King , who was elected on a tax cut pledge , is not making the same claim now . Asked several days ago if he would make that pledge , King smiled ruefully and said : " No lead pipe guarantees .
