The company said that by the end of 1983 it will close its basic steelmaking operations in Lackawanna , N.Y , its fourth-largest plant , permanently laying off 7 , 300 steelworkers , and will combine operations at its Johnstown , Pa. , mill , putting an additional 2 , 300 to 2 , 700 employees out of work. // The 82-year-old Lackawanna plant , one of the oldest in the country , was a victim of more modern and more cost-efficient operations in Europe , Japan and a number of third world countries , which have recently developed steel industries. // As a result of this competition , American steel companies have closed inefficient plants periodically in recent years , reducing capacity from 160 million tons in 1977 to 153 million this year . The Bethlehem cutbacks announced yesterday eliminate an additional 3. 5 million tons . <> <> Industry ' s Largest Loss // " There will be another 10 to 20 million tons of capacity taken off in the next year , " said Joseph Wyman , an industry analyst with Shearson/American Express. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $750 million to $850 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter , the company said . That could bring Bethlehem ' s total operating loss in the current quarter to $1 billion , according to analysts . Bethlehem lost $322. 7 million in the first three quarters. // The fourth-quarter loss would be the largest in the industry since the United States Steel Corporation , the nation ' s largest steelmaker , reported a $669 million deficit in the last quarter of 1979 after shutting 14 of its steel plants . <> <> Disaster for Upstate City // Ed Kuwik , the Mayor of Lackawanna , said that the closings would be a disaster for the city , which already has an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent and depends on the steel mill for two-thirds of its tax revenues. // " We would like to be able to keep the plant running at least at its present level , " Mr. Kuwik said . There are now 5 , 200 steelworkers employed at Lackawanna and 3 , 400 more are on layoff . ( Page D3. ) // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America that serve the Lackawanna plant were at an all-day meeting yesterday and could not be reached for comment. // The American steel industry , operating at under 50 percent of capacity , has had one of its worst years since the end of World War II , and steel shipments are expected to reach only 62 million tons for 1982 , compared with 87 million last year . Nearly half of the nation ' s 450 , 000 steelworkers have been laid off , and half of those on layoff are not expected to work in the industry again . Bethlehem has a work force of 82 , 000 , with 30 , 000 of these employees currently laid off before yesterday ' s today ' s announcement. // Bethlehem said that it was closing the integrated steel operations at Lackawanna , where steel is taken from ore to finished products , because changing market conditions , uncompetitive wage rates and the age of the plant had made it unprofitable . A decline in the auto industry ' s demand for steel , as car sales fell , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutdown. // The company will continue to operate a galvanizing line and a bar mill at Lackawanna that supply materials for the construction industry and employ 1 , 300 steelworkers. // " We believe this is a prudent course of action for Bethlehem at this time , " said Donald Trautlein , Bethlehem ' s chairman . " It should have a limited effect on Bethlehem ' s revenues and total shipments under expected market conditions. " // Timothy Russert , a spokesman for New York ' s Governor-elect , Mario M. Cuomo , said that Mr. Cuomo had been informed by Walter F. Williams , the president of Bethlehem , that the decision was final . Mr. Cuomo has formed a study group to determine if anything can be done to reverse the decision and to see what aid the state can provide to the residents of Lackawanna , Mr. Russert said. // During the 1960 ' s , the Lackawanna plant employed 22 , 000 steelworkers , but as the demand for steel from the auto industry slowed , the work force was cut to 8 , 600 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles , Lackawanna ' s population declined by 20. 8 percent , to 22 , 701 , between 1970 and 1980. // Mr. Trautlein said that one reason that Lackawanna was uncompetitive was that its local property taxes have been more than five times the average amount paid per ton of shipments at Bethlehem ' s five other major steel plants. // Bruce Davis , a spokesman for Bethlehem , said that the company ' s decision to close the basic steel operations at Lackawanna was not based on Bethelehem ' s inability to get wage concessions from the union . He said it was unlikely that the plant would have remained open , even if concessions had been forthcoming. // The United Steelworkers union has rejected two industrywide wage concession packages so far this year , and many analysts are predicting a strike in August , when the present contract expires. // Layoffs at both plants have been high . At Johnstown , 3 , 200 out of 5 , 300 workers are on layoff . An additional 1 , 900 steelworkers have been laid off at the Johnstown freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 ' s , employment at the Johnstown plant topped 12 , 000. // Johnstown ' s freight car manufacturing operation will be continued if its costs can be made competitive with other freight car builders , Mr. Trautlein said . The car shop has been closed for several months. // The new electric furnace at Johnstown and the bar producing facilities at Johnstown and Lackawanna will be established as a separate bar business unit , according to the company . Facilities for making rod and wire at Johnstown and Sparrows Point , Md . , Bethlehem ' s largest plant , will also be consolidated. // Analysts said that the reorganization of the plants ' operations could improve Bethlehem ' s financial position in the coming years , because it was basically shutting down an inefficient operation that was losing money . The company is expected to lose more than $10 a share this year. // In the first nine months of this year , the company lost $322. 7 million , compared with earnings in 1981 of $211. 4 million , or $4. 12 a share . Sales this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first three quarters of last year. //
