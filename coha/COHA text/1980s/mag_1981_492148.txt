NEW LIFE FOR THE AGING An increased life span is putting new emphasis on the need for living those dividend years in good health , free from financial worry . by Michael Allen Chronological age you can do nothing about ; spiritual age lies in your own hands . Your hands , your feet , your stomach , your mind . The choice is yours : to rehabilitate yourself by keeping occupied or to rust out by occupying a rocking chair . You can decide to stay fit , eat right , prepare for the proverbial rainy day or simply let yourself go to pot and take your chances that the golden years do not turn out to be copper-coated and quickly tarnished . Robert Browning surely wrote from a happy heart , looking Age unblinkingly in the eye when he set these lines to his immortal Rabbi Ben Ezra : Grow old along with me ! The best is yet to be , The last of life , for which the first was made , Our times are in his hand . Whatever the inspiration , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of senior adults for living enthusiastic lives into their 70s , 80s , 90s and beyond . Not that you 'll be another Norman Vaughn competing , at 75 , in the Alaskan dog-sled race and covering 1,049 miles of wilderness between Anchorage and Nome . Or a Gloria Swanson , writing and selling the story of her life at age 81 . Or an 82-year-old Armand Hammer continuing to run his 33,000-employee Occidental Petroleum Corporation . But , with proper exercise , diet , encouraging new discoveries in medicine and ever-increasing concern for the aging , your life can very well give substance to those inspiring words of Browning ? " the best is yet to be . " The 20th century has seen an explosion in the number of advocates of exercise , and most concur that it has a favorable effect on all age groups . One study of a large group of 50- to 54-year-old men showedconclusively that those who did n't exercise were five times more likely to die of a disease than those who had turned in their rocking chairs for treadmills . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century 's most deadly age-related malady , heart disease . Consider the 60-year-old dentist from Florida who had already suffered a myocardial infarction and who showed an inoperable two-vessel cardiac disease . Within three months after enrolling at the University of Florida 's Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation Program of supervised exercise , his symptoms of weakness and breathlessness disappeared , and he was able to return to his practice part-time and lead a close to normal life . Although walking is considered the best possible exercise for the over-50 generation , this does n't mean you should discontinue the exercises you have been doing and enjoying  --  be it swimming , jogging or , with your doctor 's blessing , the more strenuous activities of tennis and skiing . Do n't forget that Doc Councilman , at 58 , swam the English Channel , becoming the oldest swimmer to accomplish this feat . But he no longer carried the 245 pounds he had weighed at age 50 , no longer had a bad case of asthma , arthritis , lower back pain and high blood pressure . Told by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape up , or you 're gon na ship out , " Councilman lost 60 pounds in nine months through swimming and dieting . " Swimming , " he says , " saved my life . " No wonder he so strongly recommends swimming for older people . Or that he as sincerely believes that if middle-aged and older people treat their bodies properly , their physical potential is beyond all expectations . Other than what you do with your body , how you fuel it may also add years to your life . Along with altitude and a simple life of manual labor with no obligation to retire , diet has played a big part in setting the world records of healthful longevity . In Ecuador there are people who live to be 150 . In remote villages in the Andes , people are still working at the age of 100 . Inhabitants of the Caucasus have included one who died at age 168 . On his birthday the previous year , he is said to have performed a local dance with two of his grandsons , aged 88 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age from 80 to 104 . The man who had won the race the year before fat age 93 ) could not compete because he was on his honeymoon . These frisky centenarians still enjoying life and having little use for the civilized institution of the Old Folks Home , dine with gusto on a diet nearly devoid of meat . A little chicken once or twice a week suffices . They never eat fish . Instead , they nibble plenty of vegetables such as green onions , cabbage , lima beans , tomatoes and cucumbers , and for dessert they consume generous quantities of grapes and  --  in particular  --  apricots . Garlic is a staple . They abstain from coffee and tea , and they rarely smoke . Instead of regular bread , they substitute corn meal mush . It has been proved that Benjamin Franklin was n't just chewing the fat when he said , ? Co lengthen thy life , lessen thy meals . " Scientists have learned that they can double the maximum natural life span of white rats by putting them on a low-calorie diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancer Research in Philadelphia gave rats a choice of three different diets , all containing the same number of calories , vitamins and minerals but varying in the ratio of protein to carbohydrates . Beside proving that rats are n't any better than humans at selecting a diet for longer life , he learned that the " smart " rats , who ate moderate levels of the protein and low-carbohydrate diet all their lives and then decreased protein intake with age , outlived their fellows by a tail 's length . Fat is the great antihero when it comes to aging . Doctors now relate fat to many common diseases of the middle-aged and elderly : coronary heart disease , colon and breast cancer and atheriosclerosis . It is therefore desirable that a person over 60 actually lose weight . Modern medicine is also helping to give you an old age free from inhibiting disease . Better treatments for hypertension along with changes of life style have recently curbed the incidence of cardiovascular disease . Cigarette smoking is down 26 percent from 1965 , and lung cancer and obstructive pulmonary disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the CT scanner , help to pinpoint brain lesions and other problems at a glance , thus increasing the success of lifesaving surgeries . In the maintaining of health at any age , vitamins and dietary supplements play an important role . Every day , your body loses some of its most important vitamins ? vitamins your body does n't store and which should be replaced . In capsules or liquid form , daily potent amounts of these nonstorable vitamins will restore the old desire to " get-up-and-go , " where before you might have been more inclined to " sit-down-and-stop . " Aside from the comfort Cont. on following page and a feeling of youthful vitality , physical fitness and the absence of disease are requisites for one of the greatest pleasures of life  --  sex . A well-cared-for and pain-free body remains the world 's only proven aphrodisiac . A third requisite , too often missing in the boring routine of long-married couples , is desire . Awakening this desire is not the impossible dream you may have come to believe . A change of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three  --  could very well turn the old stalemate into a second honeymoon . Sex at bedtime and only at bedtime might once have been a necessity . Today , with the house and the entire day often to yourselves , romance can name its own time and place . A man 's most energetic time may be after a good night 's sleep or an afternoon nap . And the place may be anywhere but in the bedroom , with its deterring pictures of kids and grandchildren staring down from the walls or dresser . After a warm bath , and perhaps a little dry white wine , turn on the soft music , lock the doors and let wise old Mother Nature direct the action from there . Physical fitness and the ideal setting will help , but for peak performance , the spirit must also be willing . And the spirit is never at its best with the mind distracted by money matters or the pros and cons of retirement . One question that could be muddling your mind is : Should you retire or not ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar a gallon and certain to go higher , fuel oil close to a dollar , service charges sky-high and grocery prices increasing by the week  --  is : Can you afford to retire ? One of today 's popular bumper stickers reads , " The Battle of Inflation is Over  --  Inflation Won ! " It is true that retiring on a fixed income is one of the hazards of aging . But it is also true that Americans over 60 are enjoying a higher standard of living today than were either their parents or grandparents at the same age . For all of inflation 's devastation , Social Security , Supplemental Security Income , Medicare , pension plans and private insurance programs have given relief to many . It is a seeming contradiction , then , that in spite of the fact that old age has been given more attention than ever before in history , many older adults still find themselves poor for the first time in their lives . So who would want to take advantage of those added years only to struggle for the necessities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that makes quantity of life important . And how to attain  --  or maintain  --  that quality becomes the primary purpose of the man and woman " bothering " 60 . The number-one solution for turning the wolf at the door into a pussycat , of course , is to turn your back on retirement . This decision may be influenced not so much by monetary gain but by the continued contribution you can make to society . If you were 50 , say , before you learned all of your trade that is known , and you retire at 65 , that gives you a top-level life of only 15 years . This is n't long compared with the many years you spent in preparation . The late George Bernard Shaw , for example , was actively at work after he was 90 . Had he chosen to retire at age 65 , many of his most important works would never have been written . Or had the recently deceased Colonel Harland Sanders chosen to retire at age 65 , there would have been no Kentucky Fried Chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the life of ease your next vacation ? Retirement communities now offer a fabulous vacation for two in one of their air-conditioned apartments with private patio , color TV and completely equipped kitchen . You will be invited to special parties , may play golf and tennis , swim , drive to an exciting city nearby or perhaps take in the surrounding scenic views . After a week or two ( at a weekly rate of $150 to $200 ) , you 'll come home with at least some idea of whether this is the retirement life for you . A federally funded report , Older Americans : An Untapped Resource , points out that older Americans are " a resource that the nation can no longer afford to ignore . " The report further stresses that the health of the economy , the increasing strain on our resources ( to support Social Security , pensions and other benefits ) and the problems of keeping up with inflation all require new policies that stop discarding older people as useless and dependent . Older workers can best compete in the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or working in self-employed capacities . Door-to-door or telephone sales is traditional among older people . A man in Phoenix , for example , is still selling Watkins products at age 96 . The report further points out that longevity , higher levels of education and betterhealth among older people have combined to open up new views on the part of employers and older people themselves about the span of worklife . It is the prediction of this report that a number of factors will encourage more and more older people now working to remain on the job , among them : the need for wages to keep up with inflation , the new statutory right to delay retirement to age 70 , the fact that women entering the work force in their late 40s and 50s will need to work past 65 to qualify for meaningful pensions and more and more people in their mid-60s having the mental and physical capacity as well as the desire to keep active . There are as many good reasons why employers are willing to keep older people on the payroll or put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for workers over 46 is about one-sixth that of workers 17 to 25 and one-fourth that of the 25-to-45 age group . Older employees are more satisfied with their pay , theirsupervisor and the work itself . And older people are quite capable of learning new jobs . Choosing to trade the old rat race for the snail 's pace of retirement need not , however , spell doomsday in this day of inflation . Thirty percent of senior adults are now adding income to the family budget by working part-time . ( Earnings in 1981 can total $5,500 without affecting Social Security checks ; $6,000 in 1982 . ) Should you elect not to work even part-time ( and saving the money you get from Social Security , investments and pension becomes a necessity rather than a virtue ) , retirement affords you the time to shop around for bargains , to become more familiar with businesses offering special discounts to people aged 60 and older . You should also , whenever possible , request that your doctor prescribe generic rather than the more expensive brand-name drugs . Regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it Continued on following page will never be any earlier . With this in mind , more and more of the over-50 age group are going back to school . According to Dr. Herbert London , Dean and Director of Programs at the Gallatin Division of New York University , quoted in 50 PLUS magazine : " Students over 50 not only can compete with counterparts in the 17-to-21 age bracket , but because of well-developed study habits and conscientious attitudes toward work , they actually do far better in their academic studies . " Among the prime examples , Shelton Hubbard is a student at Loyola U. at age 85 . Alice Pearce , 82 , is a recent graduate of Arkansas Methodist College . Ethel Magee , 63 , a widow , went back to school to get her Master 's degree . Blanch Drezen , now Secretary for Minority Finance in the New York State Senate , after both of her children got Master 's degrees , decided she 'd better get her Master 's to " keep up . " Many schools offer life-experience credits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you have gone back to school , and you 've taken a part-time job or even stayed on the old job , and still the struggle for survival is causing you to sink deeper into the quicksands of debt and despair . Take heart ; President Reagan has promised to help come to your rescue . Inscribed on the banner heading his vanguard are the pledges to : ? Vigorously pursue a campaign commitment to end the Social Security system 's earnings limitation which reduces monthly Social Security payments to older Americans who earn more than the maximum allowed amount . ? Fight the " inexcusable " waste , fraud and abuse of government programs for older persons . ? Promote better health care by strengthening the Medicare and Medicaid programs , while exploring incentives for home-based care . ? Rigorously enforce the AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act . ? Continue to implement the Older Americans Act of 1965 ( which authorized some 500 Area Agencies on Aging to provide service to help meet the real needs of the elderly ) . The final obstacle to overcome in turning back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called independence . This feeling of pride too often gets in the way of taking advantage of government assistance . But do n't let it rob you of needed aid . As a citizen , these services are simply benefits to which you are entitled , benefits to help you win the battle that is currently calling our nation to arms . Pick up almost any newspaper today and cheering evidence will pop out at you that this goal of making the golden years of America 's senior adults 18-karat is not too far distant . According to yesterday 's columns  --  in spirit , at least  --  it is already here . An 82-year-old Hutchinson , Kansas , man did n't let a little thing like a cracked pelvis , acquired on the way to his wedding rehearsal , stop him from being married the next day . A couple living in Friendly Village , Rhinelander , Wisconsin , observed their 73rd wedding anniversary . A woman in South Bend , Indiana , is celebrating her 105th birthday . There is ample physical evidence that proper diet and exercise combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the limits of the human life span . But what are those limits ? Can medical science increase the ultimate life span ? Dr. Allan L. Goldstein of the Department of Biochemistry at George Washington University School of Medicine says , " Yes . It is entirely conceivable that people could live to be 150 years old . " Dr. Goldstein and his collegues are studying the effects of the drug Thymosin , a hormone made by the thymus gland , which may act to slow down the aging process by restoring the body 's immune system to the vigor it had in youth . By controlling cancer and heart disease , only about 15 years would be added to the average lifespan , he says , but by controlling the body 's immune system , perhaps 50 or more years could be attained . Today many people who are past 65 are still employed . They counsel younger people , help out when someone is ill , take care of small children , use their wisdom to give advice on jobs or business matters . Many do volun-teer work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in social agencies . The benefit to society of the great untapped workforce of millions of older people is some-thing we 've only begun to realize . That good old Yankee stubbornness , then , rather than resisting the benefits to which the aging are entitled , might better be directed toward the battle to keep physically fit , the weight down , the spirits up , the dreams alive . The years ahead will then hold the bright and shiny promise of becoming , as the movie title put it , " the best years of your life . "
