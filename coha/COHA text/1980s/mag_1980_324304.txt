THE WOOING OF EARTH by Ren Dubos Scribners ; 183 pages ; $8.95 <P> Environmentalists view the world 's wilderness areas as sacrosanct places that must be left untouched . Their concern strikes Essayist and Microbiologist Rene Dubos as ironic . Dubos , who is perhaps known best for his work in using microbes to produce disease-fighting drugs , points out that many of the areas weekend backpackers and others consider so beautiful resulted from degradation of the environment . The sere hills of Greece were produced by deforestation and erosion ; the Downs of England owe their lushness to the introduction of sheep grazing ; the orchards and fields of New England are the creation of civilization . " Humanized environments , " writes Dubos , " give us confidence because nature has been reduced to the human scale , but the wilderness in whatever form almost compels us to measure ourselves against the cosmos . " He argues that man can have his environmental cake and eat it too . With careful management , nature can be not only preserved but also improved upon . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who regard man as an interloper and a destroyer of the planet . The author , noting that all animals alter their environments , brilliantly marshals his evidence for an intelligent balance . He may not convince those whose idea of nature is the replica of the Matterhorn at Disneyland or those who see themselves as noble savages . But his words should be welcome to the great majority of people who live somewhere in between . <P> THE WORLD OF OZ by Osborn Elliott Viking ; 253 pages ; $14.95 <P> Osborn Elliott became editor of Newsweek in 1961 and set about transforming what was then a pallid copy of TIME into a feisty , prosperous competitor . " Oz " Elliott , now 55 and dean of Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism , tells how he did it and how much fun he had along the way . He rose above his humble beginnings ( St. Paul 's , Harvard , old money and a family friend , Builder-Bureaucrat Robert Moses , who got him a first job on the New York Journal of Commerce ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colleague Ben Bradlee , now executive editor of the Washington Post , conspired to have Post Publisher Philip Graham buy the magazine , name Elliott editor and begin Newsweek 's race against TIME . He recounts his proudest moments , notably Newsweek 's special issues on Black America , its early revelations about U.S. failures in Viet Nam , its agreement to hire and promote more women . <P> He does not gloss over his failures , conceding that Newsweek was slow to produce Watergate breakthroughs and that the wizard himself was growing stale and restless in his last years on the job . Apparently he had not completely recovered when he wrote his book . He does narrate many amusing anecdotes . In one , a Nixon aide phones Elliott at home soon after the Watergate break-in on an issue of considerable urgency : changing Julie 's magazine subscription . In this work , at least , Elliott chooses not to say much about the nature of his craft , his era or his inner workings . Mostly he reports what happened , as he saw it , ever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
