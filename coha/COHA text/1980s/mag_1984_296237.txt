If money is the mother 's milk of politics , two well-suckled races are under way in Oklahoma and New York . Tulsa Democrat James Jones , chairman of the House Budget Committee , is being targeted by a heavily financed Republican effort . Manhattan 's Bill Green has met a match as rich as he : Andrew Stein . <P> <P> Down-Home Budget Brawl <P> Oklahoma Democrat James Jones commands a lot of respect in Congress . He is patient and intelligent , moderate and courageous . Yet the Republicans very badly want to defeat him , indeed to skin him , and not just because he comes from a conservative , Republican district . As chairman of the Budget Committee , Jones has led the floor fight against the President 's proposed budgets , all of which projected deficits so large that no Republican dared sponsor them . He has also committed the even greater sin of offering budget plans of his own with lower deficits . To cap it off , Jones has countered Reagan 's call for a balanced-budget amendment with a bill that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balanced budget in the first place , which no President has done since Richard Nixon in 1970 . <P> Consequently , the National Republican Party and a variety of conservative political action committees ( PACs ) are expected to contribute heavily to the campaign of Jones ' articulate and combative opponent , Frank Keating . Jones , who by virtue of his position can command a wealth of PAC contributions ( from January to June , he received $216,599 ) , plans to spend $1 million defending his seat . <P> Keating calls Jones " a Tip O'Neill liberal , a Walter Mondale liberal . " Jones , who has often bucked House Speaker O'Neill by supporting budget cuts and has carefully distanced himself from Mondale , counters , " I am an independent voice for Oklahoma . " <P> Keating , 40 , a former FBI agent and U.S. Attorney , expresses sweeping support of Reaganomics and maintains that his opponent is out of touch with the voters . Says Keating : " Jones has been a leader in the liberal Democratic House representing a conservative area . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aggressiveness has brought out a heretofore hidden feistiness in his opponent . Jones , 45 , was particularly infuriated by an incorrect Keating charge that Jones had failed to report properly some of his wife 's earnings on disclosure forms . Says his campaign manager Cole Finegan : " I 've never seen Jim Jones this intense and enthusiastic . " Jones ' ads refute a Keating claim that Keating never lost a case as a prosecutor and end with the kicker , " In Oklahoma , we believe a man is only as good as his word . " <P> Keating 's best hope is to ride the coattails of the immensely popular President , who is expected to carry the district by an overwhelming margin . Yet ever since Jones was elected in 1972 , a year that Richard Nixon carried the district over George McGovern with 79% of the vote , Jones has been able to persuade his constituents to split their tickets . In 1976 Gerald Ford carried the district with 62% , and in 1980 Reagan beat Jimmy Carter 2 to 1 . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is that it has always been fiercely independent .
