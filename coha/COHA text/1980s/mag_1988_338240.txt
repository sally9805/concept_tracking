The caper took a month to plan , and just 64 minutes to execute . On Friday , May 13  --  a date chosen in a spirit of mischief  --  an $18,000-a-year clerk at First National Bank of Chicago set in motion a simple scheme that nearly bilked his employer out of $68.7 million . Aided by a gang of accomplices and his knowledge of a few secret codes , Gabriel Taylor , 27 , electronically transferred the money from accounts belonging to Merrill Lynch , United Airlines and Brown-Forman distillers to accounts that some of the conspirators had set up under assumed names at two banks in Vienna . Before the gang could collect its loot , First Chicago discovered the fraud and alerted the FBI , which last week located the money and arrested Taylor and six alleged coconspirators on charges connected with illegal wire transfers . But the embezzlers came tantalizingly close to succeeding and showed how vulnerable banks and their vast computerized cash-movement networks can be to a dishonest insider . <P> In this scheme , though , the apparent mastermind was an outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit who called himself " the Chairman . " Moore was paroled from Minnesota 's Sandstone federal prison in 1986 after serving four years of an eleven-year term for fraud . In 1982 he created a Chicago " bank , " actually a telephone answering service , and issued himself letters of personal credit . So convincing were these documents that ten air- charter companies leased planes to Moore , who used them to take off on cross- country shopping sprees . By the time he was caught , he owed $180,000 to the charter firms . <P> After his release , Moore apparently began eyeing a much bigger target : First Chicago . His contact was a cousin , Herschel Bailey , 30 , who knew Otis Wilson , 30 , a clerk at the bank . Wilson introduced Taylor to Moore and by last month the group included Neal Jackson , 31 , Leonard Strickland , 49 , and Ronald Carson , 40 . They plotted their scam at meetings in a Quality Inn on Chicago 's west side . <P> Taylor had worked for First Chicago for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dispatches multimillion-dollar sums around the world via computers and phone lines . The bank 's biggest customers routinely call this department to transfer funds , often paying money directly into suppliers ' accounts . As at most banks , transfers require that a First Chicago employee call back another executive at the customer 's offices to reconfirm the order , using various code numbers . All such calls are automatically taped . Taylor had access to the codes and knew the names of the appropriate executives at various corporations . The gang 's original plan called for stealing $232 million from the accounts of quite a few companies , including Hilton , but the group eventually settled on taking the $68.7 million from United , Brown-Forman and Merrill Lynch . The Chairman was able to recruit Taylor , who had no previous police record or employment problems , by offering him a cut of $28 million .
