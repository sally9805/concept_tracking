// Then she hung up . It was not a request that I go caroling , just a lightly given command . I hung up the phone , helpless and already embarrassed . An image of me in a Dickensian cape and long scarf with a tall beaver-pelt hat sent a shudder through me . I did n't own such an outfit , but I suddenly imagined some organization so dressing its legions before they were sent out upon the town to make fools of themselves . I pictured myself wearing a foolish costume , singing off-key carols foolishly , and walking around the streets of my hometown like a complete fool . " Fool " was the word most prominent in my thoughts , unless it was " buffoon . " What if the police stopped us ? After all , Ft . Thomas was a quiet town , with quiet ways and quiet traditions . It only had a dozen or so registered Democrats , and they were quiet about it as well . No , I did n't want to go . I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitterly cold night . The stars seemed to hover just above the treetops . They sparkled in the sky overhead and faded to a softer glow as they neared the horizon and the city lights of Cincinnati . It was a night for stocking caps and thick sweaters and woolen scarves and union underwear . Although it seemed silly enough to even walk from one house to another in such cold , it seemed utterly lunatic to charge around the whole neighborhood and invade one otherwise peaceful home after another to sing carols . At least none would be idiotic enough to wear some flimsy costume on such art arctic night . If they were so inclined they would be pneumonic after the first verse of the first song . Then perhaps they would forget the whole thing , dismiss it as a quaint but bad idea , and go straight to someone 's party . With this last hope firmly implanted in my scenario for the evening , I stopped to pick up Janet and Susan . They were dressed warmly , but normally , and I was heartened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she attended , and it dawned on me for the first time that this was some type of church activity . I do n't know why this had n't occurred to me earlier , although I have previously noted my sheltered background in the silence of the Episcopalians . The carolers were gathering in the church basement like commandos in a post-Guns of Navarone war movie . Seated at an old upright piano was the father of a friend of mine from school . He was n't playing ; he was merely seated , addressing the gathering of angelic soldiers waiting for their marching orders . As we reached the outer circle of singers , he was passing out the last of the paperback caroling books . I would have been glad to share , or not sing at all . I looked around and noted the conspicuous absence of my friend whose father was at the center of the group . He had obviously evaded the embarrassment of the evening by some ruse . His father was just finishing his general directives . " O.K. , everybody  --  now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the military , as evidenced by his inability to get their attention . It was a Friday night , and I was in a church basement  --  not even my own  --  listening to a classmate 's father sound ineffectual . " Listen , now , you all have booklets ? " This was obvious . " Hold on to them . " He thought we would sell them or burn them for warmth ? " Because we need to keep them for next year . Here " ? he began passing out a half sheet of paper ? " is a list of shut-ins who we 'll be visiting tonight . At each house we will sing two carols  --  and two carols only  --  then move on directly to the next address on the list . " If only this giant among men had been young enough to serve in Vietnam , we 'd be there to this day ! I stood in shock , unable to move . We were going to intrude on the homes of old folks  --  innocent , taxpaying old folks  --  whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , presumably by standing outside theirdoors and scaring them half to death . Or even to death . I had no adequate gauge of their frailty . I was incredulous . Was this what 20th-century caroling was all about ? Before I had time to make my excuses and avoid the entire unseemly affair , Janet and Susan had sandwiched me between them , and I was carried in a wave of amateur Mormon Tabernaclers to the parking lot . I had passed the point of no return ! Before I knew it , I was driving my father 's 1964 Chevy Monza with Janet , Susan , and another couple , and we were careening around the curves of Grand Avenue like a missile bent upon destruction . Two or three cars were in front of me , and another behind , and I felt like a member of a giddy and delirious funeral procession . " Over there now , yes , that 's it  --  right , " Janet was shouting in my ear , even though she was sitting on the gap between the bucket seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own , parked itself , and then disgorged its members in front of a little brick bungalow with a hilly front walkway . We all trooped up to the door , and as the assemblage reached its destination , the porch light went on . Our commander turned , and while Janet and Susan and I straggled from the rear , he brought a pitch pipe to his lips and then stopped before blowing and announced calmly , " Page 21 , ' Hark the Herald Angels Sing . ' " Then he blew on the pipe . A short , shrill blast pierced the night , and 30 voices , which should have sounded like one , but sounded more like 50 , began to belt out a disjointed version of the well-known carol . I shrunk back to the periphery of this religious mob , hoping that no one would come to the door , and if anyone did , that he would not call the police . The front door flew open , and a middle-aged couple stood , looking out at us , supporting between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrobe . I was relieved to note that I did not know these people , so I joined the singing in my fine Episcopalian nasal tone . The group finished , and the leader , hardly missing a beat , shouted out : " ' The First Noel , ' " and we were off again . If one has never heard " The First Noel " sung as a " round , " then he has missed a truly religious experience . Half the group had not found the carol until " the angels did say , " and rather than jump in at that point , they evidenced a solemn belief in their right and duty to sing the carol from the beginning . We bumbled sanctimoniously onward , and I wondered whether I might shrink into the hedge at the foot of the porch without being missed . Then something very curi-ous happened . The couple did not close their door , or call the police , or even seem to mind that we were disjointed , off-key , and off-pitch . ( On top of everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Their mother seemed to mind even less . A peaceful smile appeared on her face , then dissolved into a wistful glow , as if she were miles and years away . Then it was over . We were finished . The conclave turned , now with me at their head , and rolled amoeba-like back down the sidewalk . " That was n't so bad , " I heard myself saying . " Well , of course not , silly , " Janet said with a laugh . Susan half-smiled and remained , as always , silent . " Did you think it would be painful ? " Janet quizzed me . " Well , I  --  uh -- did n't know . I thought  --  well , anyway  --  let 's go on back to the church and get some punch . " My extremely wise suggestion received not the least attention , and before I could reach my car door , the commander was adroitly spurring us on to new heights . " O.K. , carolers , " he chirped . " Let 's sing while we walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With those words of inspiration , he broke into " God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen . " We were off to new peaks of caroling ecstasy , and 1 need n't tell you it did n't stop on Grand Avenue . Three houses on Edwards Court , six on Highland , and four houses on Millers Lane , and a few others sprinkled here and there . It went on for almost two hours , like a Broadway road show , playing one brief stand after another . Although the reviews varied , peaking on Millers Lane to a standing ovation from two maiden sisters , the group clearly improved . We would never be invited to sing at Notre Dame , but delusions of that nature had begun to creep into our collective mind . We had caught that crucial second wind after Edwards Court and were ready to go until midnight . The bitter cold may have numbed us . I ceased to feel it . Instead of growing tired , we were growing stronger ; instead of sounding worse , we were sounding better . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began feeling very satisfied that I had survived the night with my grand 17-year-old pride intact . I had kept a stiff upper lip , hung to the rear , followed the leader , listened to Janet 's street directions , and generally brassed out a bad night . It actually had n't been so bad . As we walked up the steps of the first house on the last street , I knew that my abbreviated career as a street performer was almost over . Hot punch and dozens of sugar-sprinkled cookies awaited me . A few houses , maybe a dozen verses of various carols , and another 20 minutes in the 20-degree weather were all that separated me from the ordeal 's end . If Ipaced myself , I knew I 'd make it . " O.K. , we 're winding up , " the general of our little chorale shouted . " ' Hark , the Herald ' ? one more time ! " We started with professional verve and punched the old carol through with a certain panache not present at the beginning of our tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people appeared . No doors opened . I was both confused and a little embarrassed again . Perhaps the shut-ins had shut us out . Or perhaps they were really bogus shut-ins and were at the country club chuckling over Manhattans at the carolers who held the misguided impression that they were enfeebled . We finished " Hark , the Herald " to a darkened porch . " ' 0 Little Town of Bethlehem , ' page 31 , " the commander called out . There was perplexity written on his face and a quizzical tone in his voice . The group 's confidence dipped as they fumbled through their books and began singing . At least the previously mandated " two-carol rule " would save us from any further discomfort . Then , just as we were zipping into the final " The hopes and fears of all the years . . . " the porch light came on and the front door creaked slowlyopen . In the shallow light thrown from a dirty glass shade , an ancient couple stood smiling at us , their hands cupped to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl , the old man lost within the folds of a thick wool cardigan . Around the white collar of her blouse was tied a red satin ribbon , and attached to his plaid flannel shirt was a clip-on bow tie , tied to look like two sprigs of holly . They had been waiting for us after all . They simply had n't heard us . " Well , Mr. Bundt  --  Mrs. Bundt  --  Merry Christmas . See you next year . " With that he turned , and with him , the rest of the loyal troupe . All , that is , except for one lowly private in the great army of angelic heralders  --  one insignificant deserter who realized in a flash of a millisecond that perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Bundt might not be there the next Christmas . In the flash of the next millisecond , he realized that for a brief moment in the history of mankind the cup of human kindness had been entrusted to his care . He drank of it , and throwing caution to the wind , determined to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ironclad two-carol rule , and opened his mouth . Words came forth . " Good King Wenceslas looked out , " I began , " on the Feast of Stephen . And the snow lay round about ? " The group halted in its path for the sidewalk and then turned and stared in wonder . They were shocked . The two-carol rule had been broken . And by a stranger . But before I could belt out " ? crisp and fresh and even , " Janet and Susan had joined me , then a half a dozen others , and finally the group leader himself . His look of horror at my boldness faded on the words " Brightly shone the moon that night , though the frost was cruel . . . . " Mr. Bundt and Mrs. Bundt held tightly onto each other and stared at us through their foggy storm windows . As the words " When a poor man came in sight , gathering winter continued on page 75 // continued from page 45 fuel " were sung , I thought for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced my way and smiled , still , like me , unsure about the facts surrounding my defection from protocol but not unhappy with the result . " ' The First Noel ? ' " he inquired of me . " Number 15 , " I said in reply and grinned , and now the entire host of cherubim and seraphim held forth with : " The First Noel , the angels did say . . . . " Janet moved over next to me and gently squeezed my hand . I remember very little about the rest of the evening . No one rebuked me for my abuse of the two-carol rule . In fact , they said nothing . Their gentle pats on the back told me all I needed to know . Janet met Danny later , and they blissfully departed . I took Susan home , and , as usual , did not dare kiss her good night . I went on to college the next year , and for all of the following years of school , I would be too displaced from the mainstream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ Evangelical . I never saw Mr. and Mrs. Bundt again . But I remember them . Every time I end up carrying my little boy through the last half of church caroling in our neighborhood . Every time I troop clumsily into a nursing home or some overheated little house to fill it with off-key singing . Every time I hear " Good King Wenceslas " I think of the dumb luck and brazen nerve that catapulted an insecure 17-year-old onto a slightly higher plane of being that special Christmas .
