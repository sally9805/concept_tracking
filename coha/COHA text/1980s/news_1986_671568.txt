" They are nonachievers , " a Western military attache said of the Iraqi Army . " Although they ' ve theoretically got the weapons , the equipment , the flag-waving and tub-thumping , they just don ' t produce results . The evidence is in. " // The war began in September 1980 . It entered a crucial new stage , many analysts here say , when on the night of Feb. 9 one of several Iranian probing attacks in the southern sector broke through long-entrenched Iraqi defenses near the city of Fao on the strategic peninsula near Kuwait on the Persian Gulf. // Moving swiftly , the Iranians poured thousands of soldiers , most of them fiercely religious Shiite Moslem volunteer irregulars , into the gap . Nearly three weeks later , after daily announcements of victories and after diverting huge amounts of artillery , tanks and troops , including the elite Republican Guard , in a counterattack , the Iraqis have not been able to oust them . <> <> A Second Offensive // In the last few days Iran has also claimed success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector - there were hundreds of Iraqi dead , the Teheran radio asserted today - that has not been mentioned in Iraqi military communiques so far . In addition , Western military sources say , satellite photographs show a concentration of 10 to 15 regular Iranian Army divisions near Susangird , opposite the middle sector of Iraqi defenses. // Experts here contrasted what one described as " five and a half years of military incompetence " and a " ponderously inflexible " Iraqi command structure with the ferocious fighting spirit of the lightly armed Iranians , who rush into battle welcoming " martyrdom " at the behest of their leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. // Those who have seen the war from both fronts find the armies a study in contrasts. // The Iranian front lines tend to be scenes of chaos and dedication , with turbaned mullahs , rifles slung on their backs , rushing about on brightly colored motorcycles encouraging the troops . Religious slogans are posted everywhere , and sometimes reinforcements arrive cheerfully carrying their own coffins as a sign of their willingness to be " martyred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat area itself . <> <> Bunkers and Trenches // In Iraq , by contrast , the military zone extends for dozens of orderly miles of defenses behind the front with tanks and artillery dug into the dirt along the roadside , elaborate World War I-style bunkers and trenches , and dump trucks excavating grid-pattern defenses. // The Iraqis have the reputation of being the best trained force in the Middle East after the Israelis and the Jordanians . Military police man the intersections , uniforms and even footwear match , somewhat unusual among many Arab armies , and officers receive snappy salutes. // " They look sharp , well turned out and superficially disciplined , " a Western career officer said . " But it ' s only superficial . When the chips are down , then the problem begins. // " The senior commanders here must realize by now that the people who have to do the dirty work - the grunts - are not steadfast in action , " he went on . " The landings the Iranians just made demonstrate this : the lads manning the positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fundamentalism // Iraq began the war motivated in part by a fear of the spread of Ayatollah Khomeini ' s Islamic fundamentalist revolution , and expected to achieve victory in a few days . Baghdad made all its gains in the first weeks of the war and has since been pushed back to defenses on its own territory. // Calling the war a battle " between Islam and blasphemy , " Ayatollah Khomeini has demanded the ouster of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and his Baathist Government , which holds a pan-Arab , secular ideology. // Typical Iranian tactics , military experts say , include waiting in a foxhole with an RPG-7 and blasting an oncoming tank at close range . The Iraqis , by contrast , rely on vast artillery fire from great distances and fortress-like defenses. // A military attache recalled that in a major battle last year , the Iraqis used two full armored divisions , taking heavy losses of tanks , to crush an Iranian force that turned out to number only 1 , 500 men . <> <> Superior Air Power // Western analysts here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timid use of superior air power . Iraq has about 400 fighter bombers , while Iran is believed to have only about 60 or 70 serviceable planes left . Iraqi pilots do not come in low over their targets as standard tactics require , critics say , but drop their bombs ineffectively from great heights. // An ambassador who once wrote a report on Iraqi air strategy said : " It ' s like a chorus , the communiques always say , ' All planes returned safely to base . ' Well , you don ' t win a war that way. " // Some military experts here traced the lack of enthusiasm among the soldiers to two major political factors : what they saw as a lack of a strong , clear sense of Iraqi national identity , and ambivalent feelings about the Hussein Government and the Baath Party. // Like other Middle Eastern countries , with the exception of Egypt and Iran , Iraq is not a historic entity , but a set of lines drawn on a map by European powers , first as semicolonial mandates after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent countries after World War II . Iraq has had 22 " revolutions , " most of them coups , since 1920 . It is an ethnically and geographically diverse land . <> <> ' Veneer of Nationalism ' // " They haven ' t had enough time for people at the extremes of the nation to believe in a unity for which to sacrifice themselves , " a diplomat here said of the Iraqis . " I doubt whether the veneer of nationalism is very thick or very substantial. " // Among the attempts to foster a sense of nationalism by Iraqi officials are constant programs on television of choruses singing patriotic songs , idealized military scenes , real battle footage of enemy corpses and festivals involving parades and dances. // The omnipresent portraits of Mr. Hussein in various guises are also an attempt to use the President as a unifying national symbol . A current joke holds that the population of Iraq is really 28 million : 14 million people and an equal number of portraits of Mr. Hussein. // Meanwhile , military analysts foresee a difficult time ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where hordes of tanks and trucks are gathered near the Umm Qasr naval base in anticipation of battle . <> <> Shift for Key General // One sign of the seriousness with which the Iraqis view the situation is the appointment of one of their most flamboyant commanders , Maj. Gen. Abdel Maher al-Rashid , the head of the III Corps , out of the chain of command to head one of the three columns counterattacking in the VII Corps area. // " The generals have got to be presenting a daily bill to Saddam , if they dare to tell him the truth , " a diplomat said . " I think the Iraqis will have a point where the casualties they take will become unacceptable , say if it was creeping up to 20 , 000 . I would guess now it ' s maybe eight or nine thousand. " // " These people are past masters at self-deception , " he went on . " They could say , O.K. , so there are some Iranians in Fao , they ' re humiliated by their defeat , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t matter and the wretched people here will accept it . They ' ve already done this with North Majnoon Island , even though it ' s important , and they say they ' ve taken the marshes back , but they haven ' t , the Iranians have been there for a year . They say these things so often , they believe it themselves , sometimes it ' s hard not to laugh when you ' re talking to them. " // He added : " In my opinion , it ' s going to get harder in the meantime . Artillery alone will not do the job ; neither will chemical weapons . At some point they will have to get on firm ground and fight hand to hand . And the martyrdom complex is not true here . They actually do mind dying. " //
