" This man has a nice smile , but he has got iron teeth . " Coming from the notoriously dour Andrei Gromyko , it was a revealing endorsement . To combat the image of decrepitude generated by a succession of Red Square funerals , the Kremlin knew it needed someone youthful and vigorous , To compete effectively in the arena of international public opinion , and particularly to vie with Ronald Reagan , it required its own Great Communicator , with a commanding presence on the podium , strong eye contact at the bargaining table , and a nice smile for the camera . That man was Mikhail Gorbachev , 54 , the youngest member of the Politburo . <P> He wasted no time in setting a tone of can-do urgency . Shortly after assuming office , Gorbachev declared a crack-down on alcoholism . As if to underscore the contrast with his aged and often invisible predecessors , he traveled widely , exchanging his fedora for a hard hat to inspect factories and showing off his stylish First Lady Raisa abroad . Gorbachev also moved quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top job , Grigori Romanov , suffered the indignity of sudden retirement . After 28 years as Foreign Minister , Gromyko was kicked upstairs , to the largely ceremonial position of President . And last week Viktor Grishin , a longtime associate of Leonid Brezhnev , was eased out as Moscow party boss . <P> Scathing in his criticism of inefficiencies in the Soviet economy , Gorbachev made preliminary moves toward streamlining the bloated bureaucracy . But he stopped well short of decentralization and the introduction of free-market mechanisms . Such bold measures would inevitably weaken the party 's absolute power , and nothing that Gorbachev has done or said suggests he is willing to run that risk . <P> Similarly , in dealing with the outside world , Gorbachev seemed bent not on introducing new policies so much as trying to make more palatable the ones he inherited . At his Geneva summit meeting with Reagan , he proved himself an able spokesman for a depressingly familiar set of attitudes , objectives and one-sided demands . The U.S.S.R. might withdraw its troops from Afghanistan , but only if that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its intermediate-range missiles from Western Europe , even though the Soviets dominate that category ; Washington must cancel Star Wars despite a huge Soviet buildup in both offense and defense . <P> More generally , Gorbachev made clear that whatever his ambitions to improve the Soviet economy and the country 's image abroad , he is determined to compete ruthlessly with the U.S. on every front and to keep Soviet military might at a level where the U.S.S.R. feels secure , and therefore where much of the rest of the world feels insecure . As the most powerful newcomer to the world stage , Gorbachev had numerous occasions to flash his nice smile , but those iron teeth were always showing .  --  By Strobe Talbott
