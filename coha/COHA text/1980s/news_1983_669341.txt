' ' I ' d never been able to have more than three or four days off together in the summer before , ' ' the travel agency worker recalled. // Currently , he has 20 days of annual paid leave but takes the bulk of this in bits and pieces during the winter . The seasonal nature of his work partly explains this , but a long summer vacation is still a fairly rare experience for any type of Japanese worker. // This is backed up by a poll just released by a private industry and labor research institute showing Japanese company employees will take an average 5. 1 days of vacation this year. // Only about 5 percent of the companies surveyed planned to give their workers more than 10 days ' break , while 23. 7 percent were ready to go as far as one week. // It definitely depends on the company . Firms with more than 1 , 000 employees were reported giving an average 5. 6 days summer break , while firms employing fewer than 300 could afford only 4. 7 days. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very complicated business that is closely related to Japanese cultural habits . Firms operating on a five-day working week are still in the minority - although a cautious decision by city banks to take one Saturday off a month starting in August could accelerate the trend. // A steadily growing number of manufacturing firms are closing down entirely for a few days during the summer . But a prolonged business recession has made it difficult for more than a very prosperous few to risk this for longer than a week . Mostly it ' s a matter of the individual worker arranging his vacation time to cause the least disruption to the company operation. // Negotiations on paid leave are almost as important as salary increases in annual labor-management negotiations , according to union official Teruo Mizumoto. // His company , with several thousand employees , is regarded as one of the more beneficent . On paper , it gives 20 days paid leave to employees with at least one year ' s service , rising to 22 days after 10 years , and 25 days after 20 years on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are a number of holidays , some paid , some not . The argument between labor and management each year is over this issue of ' ' to pay or not to pay , ' ' said Mizumoto. // For example , there are 14 public days annually designated by the government , of which the most important is New Year ' s Day . To make it a decent break , most companies close down around Dec. 29 and do not reopen until Jan. 3. // ' ' New Year ' s Day , of course , was a paid holiday , but after years of negotiations we have finally got company agreement to add New Year ' s Eve , ' ' Mizumoto said. // But worker interest in more holidays has always to be tempered by an acute awareness of the company ' s overall financial well-being. // ' ' If we press for more holidays , the company would either have to employ more people to cover the gaps or cut back on production , both of which would damage profitability , ' ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // There is a difference between theory and practice at work in the Japanese holiday system , electronics engineer Nobuo Kishimoto explained : ' ' In theory , I have 20 days of paid leave a year , and I could take them altogether . In practice , it ' s rare for me to have more than three days off at one time , and I rarely ever take my full allocation of holidays in any year. // ' ' There is a lot of self-regulation involving a sort of social consciousness . A Japanese worker thinks : ' If I take a week or so off work , that will place a greater burden on my colleagues , so I can not do it. ' // ' ' Of course , if I want to stand up for my rights , there is nothing anyone in the company can do about it . But it would be a black mark that could damage my career prospects. ' ' // This thinking explains why many Japanese workers use up their paid vacation time only if they get sick , Kishimoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do they do with their free time ? // Not much , it seems . A recent government survey found that if they took a day off during the week , 24 percent ' ' did nothing at all , ' ' while 65 percent read a newspaper or magazine , listened to the radio , or watched television . At weekends , the comparative figures were 24 and 43 percent . When they had three or more consecutive holidays , 21 percent still did nothing , 29 percent watched television or read , 20 percent took an overnight trip , and 18 percent went on a one-day excursion. // But there is a discernible trend toward more activity . Among younger people , sailing , wind surfing , and tennis are boom sports . More and more people of all ages are jogging , while tennis or jazz dance are ' ' in ' ' activities for figure-conscious women. // Travel , domestic and international , however , is in a slump .

For large companies , it is an issue of how to string holidays together for a longer break , but for workers in small companies it is still a matter of getting any sort of holiday. ' ' // Last year , employees of large companies took an average of 104. 2 days off ( including weekends , holidays , and vacations ) , while workers in small firms managed only 91. 3 days , he pointed out. // Kagawa detects a gradual change , however , impelled by the fact that ' ' younger workers are less faithful to the company in general than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher unemployment could change such free-and-easy attitudes . A survey published last week by the Junior Executive Council of Japan found 79 percent of new company employees ( hired in April ) more than willing to comply with a management request to work overtime , even if it meant breaking a date with their lady love. // This was 10 percent more than a similar poll a decade ago , reflecting concerns about job security , a council spokesman said. // //
