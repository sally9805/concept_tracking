Iran-watchers inside and outside government largely agree that US strategy now should be to keep the focus on what Iran must do to begin improving ties , while waiting to see how the succession struggle in Tehran sorts itself out. // Keeping the ball in Iran ' s court is the idea behind recent statements by President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker III , US officials say . Both men said Iran must facilitate the release of US hostages in Lebanon and renounce terrorism before Washington will be ready for better relations. // ' ' Performance is what we are looking for , ' ' Bush said last week . The President made clear his desire to have normal relations once Iran ' s behavior permits , but says he will not be goaded by anti-American rhetoric in the meantime. // // ' ' This is not a deal where we have to make gestures to them , ' ' a ranking US specialist says .

Even so-called Iranian ' ' pragmatists ' ' will not want to strain the ruling coalition by moving on the hostage issue any time soon , they say. // In the interim , the US should not be baited into action by apparent opportunities or moved by fear of Iran ' s gestures toward Moscow , the specialists say . ' ' There is not too much point in counting on this regime in the near term , ' ' says Anthony Cordesman at Georgetown University . ' ' It ' s going to tend to behave very tactically , ' ' he says , as the domestic power struggle continues . ' ' No one knows how long it will last or in what form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come and act on that , we should wait for them to come to us , ' ' Mr. Cordesman says. // ' ' The time has come for ( US ) policy to say to Iran that you are the ones that need us , ' ' said Barry Rubin , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy at a recent seminar with US Iran-watchers at the Institute . Mr. Rubin suggests that given past precedent with this revolutionary regime , it will take Iran longer than most in the West would think to put anti-Americanism behind it . ' ' Things will not happen overnight. ' ' // The specialists gathered at the Washington Institute , and others queried separately , agree that in the short term Iran ' s religious leadership will probably stick together . Iran ' s presidential elections will probably come about as scheduled this summer and proposed reforms , such as strengthening the presidency , will probably be enacted with support from so-called pragmatists and radicals. // A French specialist reached in Paris says that in the run-up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric statements made by Iranian leaders , including those by presidential candidate and Majlis ( parliament ) Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani. // In the months ahead , prospects for serious infighting are high . During the past three or four years , Iran ' s government has been in a kind of stalemate over very basic issues and unable to do much more than erratically muddle through , according to Prof. Shaul Bakhash of George Mason University , speaking at the institute ' s seminar . He expects the deep policy divisions and factionalism to reemerge quickly but with even less effective means to resolve differences now that Khomeini is gone . He foresees greater use of ' ' oppression ' ' in dealing with difficult members of the ruling coalition and a less than effective central government. // Robin Wright , journalist and author on Iran , says political wrangling , combined with the temptation to ' ' out-Khomeini Khomeini , ' ' may well spark internal assassinations , other violence , and terrorism aimed at the West . US officials agree the danger of violent spillover remains . Some leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Tehran mob , ' ' against a Western embassy , a specialist says . Or some factions trying to ' ' save the revolution ' ' could work with radical Lebanese or Palestinian groups to carry out overseas attacks , as many believe happened with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in December. // If Speaker Rafsanjani emerges as president and strong man in the months ahead , one of his main tasks ( to consolidate power and aid reconstruction ) will be to neutralize the more violence-prone groups , Professor Bakhash says . US officials say an Iran headed by Rafsanjani might be less outwardly violent than Khomeini ' s Iran . But it will probably still be an Islamic republic intent on balancing off East and West and perhaps finding anti-Americanism useful. // Professor Rubin points out that the Iranian government projects anti-Americanism not because most Iranians hate Americans , but because of fear of the potential popularity of US culture and goods , and influence that could bring. // Speaker Rafsanjani is already trying to play the Moscow card to alarm Washington , the ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rafsanjani revealed a ' ' death bed ' ' wish by Khomeini to improve ties with Moscow . Rafsanjani had planned to visit there this month but has postponed the visit because of Khomeini ' s death . The two countries are negotiating new economic agreements and the possible purchase of tanks , artillery , and armored personnel carriers. // US officials say they are not alarmed . ' ' Rafsanjani thinks he can feint to Moscow and we ' ll come crawling , ' ' says one . ' ' But we aren ' t going to let him play that game . ' ' There is not a single area of Iran-Soviet cooperation now being discussed that was not underway during the Shah ' s regime , Bakhash said. // Only if Iranian-Soviet ties developed over several years , without countervailing ties to the West , would there be grounds for concern , said Zalmay Khalilzad of the RAND Corporation think-tank in Washington . Given Iran ' s historic fear of Soviet imperialism , such a trend is unlikely , a ranking French diplomat says . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of relationship with the West to strengthen its economy and military , Mr. Khalilzad contends . The strategic threat to Iran is from its northern neighbor , not the distant US , he notes. // Iran ' s economic and military reconstruction needs are immense , Cordesman says . The war with Iraq left Iran a ' ' third-rate military power , ' ' he says . Tehran needs an investment of $25 billion to $50 billion to create the modern military force it wants , Cordesman estimates . Despite a short-term increase in oil revenues , Iranian reports of new oil reserves are ' ' lies , ' ' he says . In reality , its reserves are declining . Simultaneously , Iran ' s agriculture is in shambles and its industrial structure needs repair and investment. // What is unclear is how long it will take Iran ' s leaders to again crack the door open to the West , these specialists say . An opening to Western Europe will probably come first . Rubin suggests it could be four to six years before serious efforts to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well come much sooner. // However long it takes , the ranking US official says , it is sure to be a messy process , filled with setbacks and mixed signals , and demanding a lot of patience. // //
