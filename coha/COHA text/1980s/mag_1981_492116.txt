You may not be the type who wants to computerize your life , but as we accelerate into the 21st cen  --  tury , more and more things we buy are already computerized . Automo  --  biles will soon be universally equipped with microprocessors  --  on-board computers which will monitor fuel consumption , emis  --  sions , comfort controls and safety devices . General Motors has al  --  ready offered a " Trip Monitor " in various luxury car models . The device monitors fuel consumption , mileage  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion after you have entered the distance and speed you plan to travel . It will also tell you how much gas you 'll consume on the journey . When it 's not telling you all of these things , it 's a digital dashboard clock . Frank Mueller , a security guard , has one in his ' 79 Riviera . " I use my car computer every day , " says Frank . " It even computes how far I can travel on the fuel I may have remaining in the tank ! " Many home appliances already contain tiny computers . Buy a microwave oven today , and you can get a programmable computer . You can already computerize your entire home energy system , secur  --  ity system and home entertain  --  ment system . Alas , we all are being pulled along  --  some of us no doubt kick  --  ing and screaming  --  into a com  --  puterized world , which is destined to change the way we think , work , relate to one another and simply live . ' Fa live in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us are preparing already . Dennis Manhart has had his per  --  sonal computer for about one year . His Radio Shack TRS-80 is kept pretty much occupied by Dennis and two of his four children . Wife Karen has been a little too busy to spend much time on it , according to Dennis , but when she has a chance she wants to program a ran  --  dom food menu and base it on nutritional values . Dennis hooked his computer to an old teletype machine , which enables him to do word processing . He does church bulletins , letters , personal car  --  respondence ? ' I 've got five brothers , and at Christmas the computer helps me get family news to everyone , " explains Dennis . " The computer will properly ad  --  dress each letter , including ap  --  propriate text changes for each family member . " One of the best illustrations of the value of a home computer can be seen when Dennis ' children take over . Dennis wrote his own pro  --  grams to help his kids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with a short attention span , but Tanya , 9 , and Tra 7 , take turns at the computer v only an occasional sibling spat for control of the keyboard . Both will figure out simple and sometimes complex Continued on page 112 Computers continued from page 73 math problems , and the machine rewards correct answers with a quick compliment . Dennis Manhart is n't the only one using his computer to teach his children . Rich Theobald programmed his com  --  puter to teach his three children spell  --  ing as well as math . His youngest , Tim , 7. learned to read on a computer ac  --  cording to Rich . " When he started school , the teacher discovered he had a more advanced reading skill . He definitely was ahead of the rest of the class , all because of his work on the computer , " says Rich , proudly . Rich also used his computer to help himself in his own schoolwork study  --  ing for his MBA Degree in a Drake University Extension Course . " I used the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tic business situations . My study group of five people ran an imaginary corporation on the computer , deter  --  mined cash flows , developed market  --  ing strategies , recorded expenses  --  it was a lot of fun as well as educational , " Rich also does community volunteer work on his machine . For the local Colts Drum and Bugle Corps , he han  --  dles mailing lists . He plans to do com  --  puter consulting work for churches and small businesses as a sideline . Paul Fink is another generous com  --  puter volunteer . He 's currently in  --  volved in computer consultation at his church , Our Redeemer Lutheran . " I can handle parish and financial rec  --  ords , " says Paul . " Mailing lists are pretty routine . " Another area of Paul 's interests lies in developing a computer company for a local Junior Achieve  --  ment chapter . Paul is also on the local Chamber of Commerce Energy Task Force Committee . His role will be to utilize his computer in developing a transportation matrix ( map ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Computer consultants are n't cheap , " Paul adds knowingly . " We volunteers can do it for a lot less on our own microcomputers . " Bob Armstrong discovered he could teach foreign language to his children . Eight-year-old Brad is learning French . Bob has worked in a computer systems department but has had his own per  --  sonal computer for only the last eight months . He is currently enrolled at Clarke College in a microcomputer course . " The Clarke program is con  --  sidered the best in the country , " says Bob . " They have a terrific computer lab . I 'm learning the computer language right now . This is really more than just an adult toy . " Another Clarke student , Jim Sorensen , has some ambitious plans for his Apple II computer . He 's in  --  terested in more practical applica  --  tions  --  a home energy systems moni  --  tor , a burglar alarm control . Jim agrees with Bob about the course at Clarke . " They use the same computer systems presently available to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home is the same one they have at Clarke . " Sister Mary Kenneth Keller heads the computer education program at Dubuque , Iowa 's , Clarke College . She 's bright-eyed , energetic and a dedicated teacher of her craft . She was instru  --  mental in getting a National Science Foundation Grant of $206,676 to help convert an old school laundry into a gleaming 2,750-square-foot computer lab , complete with 10 interactive microcomputers U0 more are on the wayl , and a full range of complemen  --  tary equipment , including video dis play terminals , speech synthesizers , printers , graphics tablets , light pens and telecommunications hook-ups which will allow Clarke access to other computers from schools and institu  --  tions from virtually anywhere in the world . The music department at Clarke even has its own computer which is used to help students compose and synthesize music . " The most valuable application of home computers is teaching , " says Sister Mary Kenneth . " A computer ex  --  pands our capacity to think and create . You may say you ca n't draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by you to draw a straight line , a curved line , any kind of line you desire , be  --  cause you can actually program a com  --  puter to help you draw . " Computers in education is an ex  --  citing field , " adds Sister Mary Ken  --  neth . " Textbooks are being written now , not on paper for actual books , but on magnetic disks for computers . The entire way we handle knowledge and information is changing . " Jim Gruber purchased a computer for his teen-age son , Jon , but soon Jim himself was bitten by the computer bug . He enrolled in a computer course and now he 's programming a stock portfolio and his home finances . " Jon was why I bought the computer in the first place , " confides Jim . " I want him to have a head start , because people who know how to handle these things will have an advantage in life . But I got into it myself . I just love the computer-science program , " says Jim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pro  --  grammer , enbraced the family com  --  puter with boundless enthusiasm and imagination . He has created complex computer games and programs , and it 's not uncommon for him to sit down at the keyboard for eight hours at a stretch . He brought his friends to the house , and they 're now planning to create a computer-programmed , ani  --  mated science fiction movie a la Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back . Jerry Kemp is a self-described com  --  puter nut . One of Jerry 's many home computers actually talks to other en  --  thusiasts ' machines via a nationwide telephone-line network . This kind of en  --  thusiasm can be costly to the average home computer user , however . " I 've had phone bills as high as $300 a month , " confesses Jerry . This brings up another interesting feature of microcomputers  --  their abili  --  ty to communicate with one another . " My computer can call Wall Street , for example , " says Jerry . " I can obtain up-to-the-minute stock prices right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all have the opportunity to do our banking from our homes through a computer line to the bank 's computer . Same is true for paying bills , transfer  --  ring funds and a whole host of other services , " says Jerry . However , more sophisticated ap  --  plications for a home computer already belong to John Conley. a communica  --  tions technician . John is currently building a special addition to his house which will feature a solar-heated TV studio and observatory equipped to scan the heavens . John will use his computer to control home energy out  --  put . Among other things , John is a ham radio operator , and he 's applying his computer technology to his com  --  munications network . John is also working out a program to help manage ethyl-alcohol production from corn he grows on his land . The alcohol will be used to power his vehicles and other home appliances . His obvious goal is to be completely energy self-sufficient , and his computer is involved in the decision-making and record-keeping process . People who have owned their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as more than just machines . Retiree Dick Paradise and his wife , Katherine , call their computer by name ? " KADI " ( for Katherine and Dick ) . " 1 obtained an old teletype machine from an insurance company which was getting rid of them for more modern equipment . 1 paid about $200 for mine , and my friends helped me hook it up to my computer . It 's a cheap way to get a very adequate printer , ' " says Dick . Dick is a self-taught microcomputer operator . " 1 enjoy sitting down , follow  --  ing the instruction book and learning all about this thing by myself . I like a challenge , and it is challenging . " Wil Bauer brought home a Radio Shack computer after his wife Cyndy thought she might like to work with the children on one . " The instructions are really easy and are occasionally funny , " says Cyndy . " During one of the first exercises in the book , it told me to get up , stretch , walk around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get up and enjoy such simple pleasures . " Cyndy will be doing household expense computing , menu planning and recipe files , but meanwhile , daughter Terry is learning math by playing blackjack games , and four-year-old Kristy can already spell her name on the computer . Larry Pensel an electrician , has been working with computers as a hobby for four years . He first purchased a build  --  it-yourself computer kit which required over 10,000 hand-soldered connections . But he recently purchased a popular electronics store brand to help teach himself programming so he could figure out how to run the original com  --  puter . He fell in love with the newer , easier-to-understand machine . " I do n't even fire up the other one , - admits Larry . " Operating the new computer is so much fun . It 's a real tension reliever . I sit at it for hours at a time . " Larry has been running programs for his two children . " I developed my own programs to teach multiplication , for example .

Joyce Hohenadel , a pay  --  roll record clerk , took a basic computer-science course at Marycrest College in Davenport . Iowa . Since the college had a limited number of com  --  puters available for the students . she visited a local computer store . She spotted an engineer who was buying some accessories , so she asked him for some advice . Joyce eventually pur  --  chased an Apple computer for a little over $1,000 , took it home and plugged it into her TV set . " It came with a great instruction book  --  better than my college textbook , - says Joyce . Then her husband , Sam , was laid off from his job at a Davenport factory .
