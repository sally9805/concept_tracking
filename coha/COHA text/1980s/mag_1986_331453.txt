A brokerage-firm margin clerk sitting at a keyboard in Denver changes a few letters on a computer screen and magically transforms 1,700 shares of Loren Industries stock worth $1.50 each into the same number of Long Island Lighting shares selling for more than ten times that price . A keyboard operator processing orders at an Oakland department store changes some delivery addresses and diverts several thousand dollars ' worth of store goods into the hands of accomplices . A ticket clerk at the Arizona Veterans ' Memorial Coliseum issues full-price basketball tickets , sells them and then , tapping out codes on her computer keyboard , records the transactions as half-price sales . <P> These are among the cases brought to light in a new study released last week by the National Center for Computer Crime Data , a Los Angeles research firm . The results of the survey , the first comprehensive study of people who have been prosecuted under computer-crime laws , suggest that although teenagers like the members of Milwaukee 's widely heralded " 414 " gang are a real annoyance , the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal older and not half so clever . " Generally , these are unsophisticated crimes , " says the center 's director , Jay BloomBecker . " The myth that computer crime is this romantic activity done by geniuses and involving millions of dollars is just that  --  a myth . " <P> One of the more surprising results of the survey is how few cases it turned up . Canvassing 130 prosecutors ' offices in 38 states , BloomBecker was able to uncover only 75 computer crimes . This suggests either that the problem is grossly exaggerated or that victims are not reporting incidents that , if publicized , might expose the vulnerability of their computer systems . Moreover , many of the so-called computer criminals , like the Oakland subway riders accused of using folded $5 bills to coax free Bay Area Rapid Transit tickets from computerized coupon dispensers , had only the most rudimentary knowledge of the machines they manipulated . <P> Most misdeeds boiled down to what Donn Parker , a computer-crime watcher at SRI International , calls " data diddling "  --  entering false numbers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases , for example , a programmer at a savings and loan company in Los Angeles transferred $5,000 into his personal account and tried to cover up the switch with phony debit and credit transactions . The error was picked up in a routine bank audit . Among the 15 programmers and ten students nabbed , the offenses committed most often were thefts of software and telecommunications services . The rest of the crimes were scattered among a rogues ' gallery of electronic lowlife that included seven bank tellers , five unskilled laborers , two computer-company executives , a TV reporter and a former Los Angeles County deputy sheriff .
