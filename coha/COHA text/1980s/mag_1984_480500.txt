The first 1040 form was issued seventy years ago . It came with one page of instructions , which anyone earning $3,000 or more a year was to follow . Enforcement was feeble : the Internal Revenue Service had one lawyer . Less than one half of one percent of the population filed , and those 357,598 citizens paid taxes at rates of from one percent to seven percent . Congress had expected the personal income tax to bring in $70 million , but only $28 million was collected . Cordell Hull , the Tennessee congressman who drafted the income tax law of 1913 , nevertheless remained confident it would redress the inequities of a tax and tariff system " virtually exempting the Morgans and the Rockefellers with their aggregated billions of hoarded wealth . " The " 65 or over " exemption was not to be found on the first 1040 . It was added in 1948 on the grounds that the aged are more likely to be poor . In 1981 , 1,815 individuals over 65 declared incomes of more than $1 million , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these wealthy aged took their $1,000 exemption . The government originally made no distinction for tax purposes between sources of income : all profits from the sale of such capital assets as stock and real estate were fully taxable in 1913 . That has changed over the years , and today just 40 percent of long-term " capital gains " are taxed . In 1980 , this tax break was worth $21.5 billion , and nearly two thirds of it went to the wealthiest one percent of Americans ? those earning $100,000 or more annually . Only $1.5 billion went to the 80 percent of Americans who make less than $30,000 a year . Those who make more than $200,000 a year make an average of 40 percent of it from the sale of capital assets . With the tax cuts won by President Reagan figured in , this " capital gains " income is taxed at a rate of 20 percent . According to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , " The top rate on such ' capital gains ' now is actually lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wage earner with a family of four earning just $12,000 . " Taxes on interest payments and dividends were originally withheld " at the source " by banks and corporations , as taxes on wages still are . But withholding of interest and dividend taxes was eliminated in 1916 , and since then the IRS has merely received reports of such income . While 99 percent of all wages are now declared , according to the IRS , only 89 percent of interest payments and 85 percent of dividends actually get declared . Annual loss to the Treasury : $8 billion . In an attempt to recapture that revenue , withholding at the source became law again in 1982 , but Congress and the President , under heavy pressure from the banks , repealed it once more last year . " Banks and savings and loan institutions can contribute at election time , " the chairman of the Taxpayers Committee , former U.S. Senator Floyd K. Haskell , noted on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 increased the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement fund established by someone self-employed . The idea , as argued by proponents of tax cuts , was ro spur personal savings and , thereby , capital investment and economic growth . By last spring , however , the personal-savings rate was at 4 percent of income , the lowest in thirty-three years . Wharton Econometrics of Philadelphia predicts only a modest increase this year , to 5 percent . The Treasury Department believes that most of the money going into Keoghs represents assets shifted from other bank accounts carrying lower interest rates or fewer tax advantages , and not fresh savings . Keoghs have also provided opportunities for arbitrage , a form of " investment " that yields no economic growth . A taxpayer in the 50 percent bracket can come out ahead simply by borrowing money at 18 percent ( 9 percent after taxes ) and investing it in a 12 percent tax-sheltered Keogh account . In 1981 , Chase Manhattan Bank solicited upper-income taxpayers by mail , offering to lend them $7,500 to do exactly that . " Income averaging " ( Schedule G ) has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government acknowledges that taxing income on an annual basis can lead to inequities . These occur because the progressive tax structure penalizes someone ? such as an inventor , author , or athlete ? whose income increases dramatically one year but declines the next . Allowing such people to average their income over five-year periods was meant to smooth out the tax rates for those in feast-or-famine professions . But according to a report done for the Democratic Study Group , those who have gained the most by using Schedule G have been young doctors and lawyers ? those " likely to have rapidly rising incomes " but , unlike authors and inventors , to have little expectation " of seeing them drop again . In 1981 , the income-averaging provision was used by 6.5 million taxpayers , most of them " unintended beneficiaries . " The cost to the Treasury : $3.8 billion . The investment credit first appeared on the 1040 form in 1962 . The Kennedy Administration wanted to stimulate investment in new , more productive plants and equipment , and felt that a credit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income ) would be the most efficient way to do it . The administration hoped that small-businessmen , farmers , and individuals operating businesses at home would , in particular , benefit . Two decades later , this credit is costing the Treasury about $18 billion annually , but individuals and small businesses are not the main beneficiaries : 75 percent of the credits are going to the biggest one tenth of one percent of U.S. companies . " Even without a special tax break , profitable companies would be investing constantly in new machines , " argues Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice . Many studies in the last twenty years have reached the same conclusion . Perhaps the most famous taxpayer to benefit from the credit is Jimmy Carter . In 1976 he owed no tax on an income of $55.000 after he took a large investment credit for new peanut-processing machinery . In 1776 Adam Smith endorsed the idea that taxpayers " ought to contribute toward the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities . " President Reagan also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax Act of 1981 . According to the Congressional Budget Office , however , the tax and budget changes mandated by that law and others in recent years will cut the disposable income and benefits of families earning less than $10,000 a year by $17 billion between 1983 and 1985 . During this same period , those making more than $80,000 a year can expect tax benefits totaling more than $55 billion .
