Shepley , then Time Inc. ' s president and later chairman of the board of the Star : " It is vitally important that the greater Washington area continue to have the services of two strong newspapers .

Richard Munro : " Despite our substantial investment , the newspaper continues to lose money and shows no prospect of a turnaround . Regrettably , we feel we have no choice but to close it .

Otherwise the nation 's capital will be left with only one major newspaper , the Washington Post ( daily circ. 618,000 ) . This was cause for mourning in a city where decision makers depend on a full and vigorous airing of important public issues . " An extremely sad day , " said President Ronald Reagan .
