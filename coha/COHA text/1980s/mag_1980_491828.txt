Is marijuana just the " innocent high " some have made it out to be ? New medical research into the effects of this widespread drug points to heretofore unknown risks , as this exclusive two-part Post series will show . unreal , " the school guid- ance counselor told me .

' " The guidance counselor is Rick Gibson from Goddard , a small town in Kansas . I met him at lunch in another small Kansas town , Wellington . We were both attending a two-day " Grass Roots Conference on Grass . " Wellington 's population is 8,500 . The school auditorium has 1,000 seats . And both days there was standing room only . Physicians , teachers , school administrators , guidance counselors , psychologists and parents came from all over Kansas and by Peggy Mann from nearby states to attend . The Wellington conference was part of a burgeoning new movement throughout America . Schools and parents ' groups are waking up to the fact that : ( 1 ) marijuana abuse has reached pandemic proportions among our youth ; ( 2 ) something must be done about it ; and ( 3 ) they are the ones who must do it . They realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising tide of medical evidence showing that pot can have serious psychological and physical effects . It can cause cellular damage and impair lung function , the reproductive system and the brain . Furthermore , the younger the user , the more deleterious the effects . The roster of speakers at Wellington was an impressive one . The first speaker after lunch was Dr. Harold Voth , senior psychiatrist and psychoanalyst at the famed Menninger Foundation in Topeka , Kansas . He has studied the psychopathology of marijuana in depth for the past eight years . Coincidentally , his first point carried on from the one the guidance counselor had just made to me . " Marijuana produces a wide spectrum of symptoms , " said Dr. Voth . " Some affect some people ; some affect others . And there are those who seem to get away with it ' reasonably well , for a while . But there is one truly pernicious symptom  --  specifically related to marijuana  --  which seems to be evident in every chronic pot user , youngster or adult . This is the extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of marijuana . The user will scoff at the evidence , twist it , pervert it , call it ' reefer madness ' ? anything except look it straight in the face . " This may be one reason much of the media have , until recently , done shockingly little to relay the medical findings about the harmful effects of marijuana to the American public . " In my opinion , marijuana use in the United States today constitutes a national crisis , and all-out efforts from all segments of our society are essential in view of the enormous harm being done to millions of Americans , particularly our youth . " Statistics on youth drug abuse clearly show why Dr. Voth 's prescription for " all-out efforts " must be heeded on a national scale . For example : ? According to a report published by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control , " The United States is the most pervasive drug-abusing nation in history and marijuana is our most pervasive illegal drug of abuse . " Says Congressman Lester Wolff ( D-NY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are the first in all history to have used marijuana on a mass scale . Neither this nation  --  nor any other nation  --  has ever before faced a problem that is so insidious and so dangerous . " ? Last year , according to the federal government 's drug abuse network , marijuana accounted for the second largest number of admissions to our federally funded drug treatment facilities , and 33 percent of these had started their pot use before age 14 . ? According to a recent national drug abuse survey covering ages 12 and up ( 1976-1977 ) , use of marijuana is twice as high for youngsters as for adults , and use by youngsters ages 12 to 17 increased by nearly a third in one year . ( A new national survey has just been carried out by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and , according to Dr. Robert Peterson , assistant director of research , " We would be very surprised if this did not show an increase in use , especially among young users . " ) ? According to the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken every year since 1975 ( representing every state except Alaska and Hawaii ) : ? In 1979 , one out of ten high school seniors smoked pot daily , or almost daily  --  an 80 percent increase since 1975 . Of these , daily users averaged 31/2 joints ( marijuana cigarettes ) a day ; 13 . percent smoked more than seven joints daily . ? Of the 50 percent of seniors who smoked pot at all during 1979 , 37 percent said they " usually stay high seven hours or more . " ( Add to this the fact that marijuana is up to ten times more potent than that smoked a decade ago . ) ? Forty-nine percent of all seniors who used pot " during the past 12 months " also used one or more additional illegal drugs during that period . It is worth noting that this study surveys only those students who have made it to the end of their senior year . Drug use among dropouts is notably higher than among those who finish high school . ( In some areas , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but " pot breaks . " ) Also not included are those who were not in school the day the survey was taken . Truancy is another " symptom " of regular pot use . All recent state , city , suburban and rural surveys show that pot use has increased rapidly among youngsters of all income levels and all grade levels , with the highest increase at junior high school age . Throughout the country , surveys show that junior and senior high school kids are getting stoned on the way to school , during school , after school and at home  --  where they often " smoke out the window " or burn incense to cover the smell . One local newspaper series on the subject started : " For many middle school students , marijuana has replaced Wheaties as the morning ' meal . ' " In some areas , pot use starts as early as the fourth and fifth grade . If the saying is true , " as Maine goes , so goes the nation , " it is worth noting that a 1979 two-county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 percent had tried marijuana at least once and one percent had used it " many times .

' 80 " The target for drug paraphernalia in the 1980s is ages 6 to 16 , " the operator of one of Florida 's largest head shop chains recently admitted , claiming it was " an industry decision . " Organized campaigns of this sort , added to tremendous peer pressure , are misleading young people into believing that pot smoking is a normal part of growing up . the times " in this area . Dr. Richard Blum , one of the country 's foremost authorities on drug abuse , studied 3,200 school children in California and found that some started pot use in third grade . Said Dr. Blum : " The phenomena that appear in California generally appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Blum 's survey was conducted in 1976 . For the past two years , pediatrician Dr. Ingrid Lantner has been speaking on the subject of marijuana at schools in the suburbs of Cleveland , Ohio . She speaks two or three times a week , often to fifth and sixth graders . She always asks them : " How old is the youngest child you know who has smoked marijuana ? " Dr. Lantner told me : " I have never asked this question without hearing about a two- or three-year-old who has been given marijuana by older siblings or parents  --  and not only once . I know several youngsters who have been smoking daily since they were six years old . In all these cases , the parents are users . I have never known of a grown-up who would give a child that age a tobacco cigarette or any other drug . " Dr. Lantner also asks for written questions from her young audiences . Every time she speaks she receives one or two questions which indicate that parents give pot to their young children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents let me smoke pot since I was six . Will my eggs be damaged ? " " My brother smoked M.J. since age seven but not every day . Will he have his growth affected ? He is now 11 . He gets the M.J. from my mother . " Another question Dr. Lantner often receives from fifth and sixth graders is : " What shall I do if someone physically forces me to smoke pot ? " " School principals tell me , " says Dr. Lantner , " that after a ball game , a group of potheads  --  older students  --  often come around to sell drugs , and they 're very aggressive with the little ones , insisting they buy and smoke on the spot . This happens in a nice , upper-middle-class area in the suburbs of Cleveland . " Nor are the suburbs of Cleveland , Ohio , the only area in the country where parents are giving pot to very young children . Take Missouri , for example . Ed Moses , drug information officer of the state of Missouri , works full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year drug abuse is affecting younger age groups , " he told me . " They commonly start feeling the pressure to turn on as early as the fifth and sixth grades . Also , every year the marijuana is getting stronger and more easily available in larger quantities . " I think the most disturbing thing I 've found is many parents ' attitude that marijuana is so harmless that it 's okay to reward their three- and four-year-old child with getting high . " For example , at parties , the parent will let the three- to fiveyear-old child carry the joint around to the toking pot-smoking guests . And , as a reward , the child is allowed ' to take a hit ' and get stoned . This is becoming more and more common among young parents who are heavy users . " The youngest I have seen in a home was with a couple in their early 20s who got their ninemonth-old baby high by ' shotgunning ' the child turning the cigarette backwards with the lit part in the mouth so that a concentrated rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or face . The father told me , ' We like to get Annie high so she wo n't be afraid to walk . ' I pointed out that she was so stoned she could n't even crawl . The father said , ' Well , that 's cool . At least she 's not afraid to try . ' ' She boogies around when she gets high , ' the mother said , laughing . This meant that the baby bounced around a little while . Then she sat  --  spaced out . " A kindergarten teacher in a South Texas town told me , " My children do n't smoke pot . But the first grade teachers tell me that some of their children come in stoned  --  always the ones with older brothers and sisters . " Maryland is so " typical " that it is often referred to as " America in miniature . " Certainly the 1978 Maryland statewide survey reflects what is being found in local surveys throughout the country : " Students began using one or more illegal drugs at about one year earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey ( 1975 ) . " And the " one " drug is invariably marijuana . Most local surveys show that , each year , initial marijuana use drops one year lower . Older siblings are the chief source of supply for very young users . Because the myth of marijuana 's " harmlessness " has so permeated our society , youngsters often feel they are doing their smaller brothers and sisters a favor by getting them high . There is also another motive . If the younger child gets involved , he or she wo n't " narc " ( tell Mom and Dad ) . It is quite possible for Mom and Dad to be unaware of the fact that their children are stoned . With marijuana use it 's easy to " hide the high " or to " come down " by dinner time . The clearest tell-tale symptom  --  red eyes  --  is handled by kids via eye drops . ( The eye drop industry reports a boom in sales . ) Youngsters who use a local swimming pool have an easy excuse ? " chlorine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been to the water was hanging out in the locker room blowing grass . There are , of course , discernable symptoms of the youngster who is a heavy pot user . Unfortunately , most of them are so much like the " blow up " symptoms of normal adolescence that many parents tend to disregard such as merely something their child will " grow out of . " But this is not likely to happen unless the child gets some firm , supportive help from parents and from the school . Parents should realize that even the " straight " kids ( non-drug users ) ? who represent about 50 percent of most surveys of junior high and high school classes  --  are under constant peer pressure to " Try it : It 's great . " And this pressure to start pot use comes not only from peers . All kids are affected by aspects of adult industries which make drug use in general  --  and pot use in particular  --  seem like a normal part of growing up in America today . For example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of non-drug-using kids listen to rock music on the radio three hours or more a day , virtually all drug-using youngsters listen three or more hours a day . Some reported : " I listen all the time when I 'm home . " In addition , they have favorite records and cassettes that they put on when they 're high and " float with them . " The same Atlanta researcher , Dr. Fred Crawford , studied the contents of rock lyrics to determine what messages they contained suggesting or supporting drug use . He found that more than half of the current rock songs had messages condoning or suggesting the use of drugs , and that many students start listening to rock music at about the time of first use . And what do they hear when they listen ? There are countless songs with " do drug " messages such as this from Eric Clapton : Cocaine , cocaine She 's all right . And this from Dr. Hook 's Medicine Show , the Sloppy Seconds album ( " killer weed " is marijuana ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine And some men need some cactus juice To purify their brains . Blow your whistle , Bang your gong , Roll up something to take along Feels so good it must be wrong Freakin ' at the freakers ' ball . Another example of the " mesContinued on following page , sages " youngsters receive from the adult community comes from the drug paraphernalia industry  --  now a $3 billion business . A highly profitable line is the " kiddie " drug paraphernalia , which includes such items as baby bottles and " Catcha-Buzz " flying discs which double as pot-smoking devices , skateboards and kiddie belt buckles for " hiding your stash " ( your supply of pot ) , comic books which show how to cut and snort cocaine and McGrassey 's Reader , an easy-toread , 20-page primer which includes clear directions on how to roll a joint , a pot vocabulary , advice on what to wear to your first pot party , plus a packet of alfalfa " practice grass . " For more advanced readers there is The Whole Drug Manufacturers ' Catalog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bathtub Dope : How to Produce Drugs from Non-Prescription Items and Household Chemicals in Your Kitchen Without Prior Chemical Knowledge . " In most states such items are legal and can be found in various varieties of stores , including posh gift shops , boutiques , record stores , flower shops and stores which specialize in magic , Oriental gifts , leather goods , smoking goods , etc. , as well as in the " head shops . " And some head shops advertise openly in school newspapers as " novelty shops . " The kids know what they are , but ( presumably ) the teachers do n't . One of the biggest head shop chain operators in Florida recently told Florida state legislator Mary Ellen Hawkins : " The target for drug paraphenalia in the 1980s is ages 6 to 16 . " He said this was an industry decision . What does all this mean in terms of our youngsters ' health ? And what can parents look for as possible signs or symptoms of chronic pot use among youngsters ? The psychological symptoms are often the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased irritability ( " stop hassling me " flared out for no justifiable reason ) ; a general apathy ; depression ; drastic , inexplicable mood changes ; feelings of isolation ; a cutting off of communication between parent and child and a general loss of interest in everything except pot smoking and the accompanying " kiddie drug culture . " There are two very common physical symptoms : a chronic cough  --  a bothersome , constant hacking  --  and chest pains . Says Dr. Ingrid Lantner , " I have yet to see a teen-age tobacco smoker complain of chest pains , but it 's quite common among pot smokers . School nurses tell me this , too . " However , it is the nonvisible physical symptoms which may be the most damaging . And this is the information which is finally crossing the chasm between the scientific community on one shore , which has been putting forth these findings at ever-increasing rates , and the general public on the other shore . For years this chasm has not remained empty . It has been industriously filled with misinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , even outright lies emanating from pro-pot organizations and individuals whose purpose seems to be to discredit the findings which prove that pot is harmful and to make it seem an essential and harmless ingredient of the " now " way of life . Because of this constant surge of misinformation , which is still heard loud and clear throughout the land , pot smokers often have pat answers when confronted with the warning signals now coming loudly and clearly from the scientific community . One common " turnoff " of these findings is the shoulder-shrug comment , " For every study showing that pot is harmful , there 's another showing it 's harmless . " This is simply not true . One of the world 's most knowledgeable experts in the field of marijuana is Dr. Carlton Turner , director of the Federal Marijuana Project funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) . Dr. Turner and his associate , Dr. Coy Waller , have just completed a hefty two-volume work : Marijuana- ? An Annotated Bibliography . The first volume has already been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In preparing these works , Dr. Turner abstracted more than 5,000 scientific publications on cannabis ( the plant from which marijuana , hashish and hash oil are prepared ) . He says : " As a scientist , I have to be objective . I am not a crusader for or against any drug . I am for evaluating any drug on its merit , which I base on all scientific publications about that drug . There is not a single paper on the crude drug marijuana which gives it a clean bill of health , not a single paper to support it as an innocuous drug . " A widely quoted study of 30 Jamaican cane workers was never published by a scientific journal . It could not stand the scientific review process . " There are some reports on individual cannabinoids indicating possible therapeutic use . " ( Cannabis contains 61 known cannabinoids  --  substances unique in nature , found only in the cannabis plant . ) " However , it must be remembered that any drug has some side effects , and with the broad biological action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects may outweigh the benefits in longterm use . This is the reason that marijuana has no place in modern medicine . Using marijuana would be like giving people molded bread to eat to get penicillin . " Media , with some exceptions , have not taken the time to understand the nature of the crude drug marijuana . If you attend a conference and there are 15 scientific papers cautioning against the use of marijuana , and one saying that a single extracted cannabinoid might be useful in a therapeutic area , the media headline this by saying that marijuana has been found to be useful . The findings are reported in such a way that the public is led to believe joints of street pot are being smoked by peo ple with glaucoma or by cancer patients to control nausea after chemotherapy treatments , when the research is actually being done with a synthesized THC capsule . And by the time this ' news ' sifts down to the school yard , you have kids saying that pot cures cancer , pot cures nearsightedness and pot cleans out your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter comes from early findings which indicated that marijuana might be helpful in cases of asthma . Further research clearly showed just the opposite is true . ) " Incidentally , why the media have generally been so ' up ' about publicizing the possible medical benefits of marijuana and so ' down ' on relaying the consistently emerging evidence concerning the harmful effects of marijuana is a matter to be comtemplated . " Another common argument of pot-smoking youngsters is this : " You have your martini , so why ca n't I have my pot ? " Dr. Nicholas Pace has a solid answer for this question , and he is well qualified to give it . Dr. Pace is the co-founder and past president of the New York City Affiliate of the National Council on Alcoholism . He is also one of the founding directors of the American Council on Marijuana and Other Psychoactive Drugs . Dr. Pace points out : " There are two important differences between alcohol and marijuana . First , alcohol has a single chemical , and it is water soluble . One ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 hours . " What about pot ? Youngsters like to consider it a ' natural weed . ' Some even believe it to have health-giving properties . In reality , however , cannabis is an extremely complex crude drug containing 421 known chemicals . When you smoke a joint you are combusting these chemicals into hundreds of other different compounds . And we do n't know how they are affecting the body . " We do know , however , that among the 420 basic chemicals are Continued on page 43 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 61 known cannabinoids ( new ones are being discovered all the time ) , and so far scientists have studied only a few of them . We know that at least four of the cannabinoids are psychoactive , or mind-altering . But a few of the nonpsychoactive cannabinoids which have been studied thus far appear to be even more harmful to certain organ systems than the psychoactive ones . " Therefore , " says Dr. Pace , " the first important point to be kept in mind is that even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , a Pandora 's box of unknowns . " " NIDA marijuana " is grown on a well-guarded five-acre " pot farm " on the outskirts of the University of Mississippi . This project , funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and directed by Dr. Carlton Turner , supplies to researchers marijuana which has a relatively stable Delta-9-THC content of about 2 percent . ( This is the chief psychoactive cannabinoid in marijuana . ) Dr. Pace points out that so-called " good street pot " has a 4 , 5 or even 6 percent THC content . Therefore , sobering as the research findings are , they gain an even greater impact when we realize that they represent work with THC half as potent as that which many of our youngsters are smoking regularly today . " The second important point regarding marijuana , " says Dr. Pace , " is the fact that it is fat soluble , like DDT . And we have , of course , banned the use of DDT because it accumulates in body cells and organs . " The cannabinoids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lipophilic  --  fat loving . The fatty sections of cells and membranes and the fatty organs of the body act like magnets attracting the cannabinoids . The cell membrane  --  the coating surrounding the cell  --  is at least 60 percent fat . When the fat-soluble cannabinoids dissolve in the cell membrane , they make it difficult for the most important constituents of the cell , the proteins , to enter . And cannabinoid clogging of the cell has additional deleterious effects . " What about the fatty organs ? It should be remembered that the chief fatty organs of the body are the gonads ( sex glands ) and the brain . Indeed , the three-pound human brain is composed chiefly of fat . As one prominent researcher once noted : ' We 're all fatheads , from that point of view , ' " Dr. Pace and every other marijuana researcher I have interviewed agree that the fat solubility of marijuana is the most important  --  and ominous  --  single factor about this drug . Why ? Dr. Pace puts it this way : " The most studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactively in the body in human and animal studies . All the studies show that it takes three days to a week for the body to rid itself of half the THC in a single joint and much longer ( some studies show up to 30 days ) to get rid of all of it . This means that even if a youngster smokes only one joint a weekend , about half the THC and other cannabinoids remain in the body . Half the cannabinoids in next Saturday night 's joint are added to the first . And so on , for a smoke-filled series of Saturday nights . " Dr. Robert C. Gilkeson , who has spent 15 years in neurophysiologic research , puts it this way : " No drug or chemical improves the normal cell . Marijuana is a known intoxicant . Toxic means poison . Anyone who smokes or ingests more than the equivalent of one marijuana cigarette every 30 days will accumulate an acute neurotoxic substance in his or her body . " What are the results of " cannabinoid accumulation ? " A single article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear when picking up a 777-page volume , Marijuana : Biological Effects , published by Pergamon Press . This contains 50 scientific papers given at the two-day Reims Conference held in France in July 1978 . The conference was limited to marijuana 's effects on the lungs , the reproductive system , the brain and the cells . The September issue of the Post will discuss these four areas in depth , as well as give some useful pointers for parents and other interested adults who wish to combat this " grass fire " of marijuana use among our young people .
