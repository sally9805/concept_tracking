A new law aims to lure money from overseas investors <P> On the surface , the tax bill that President Reagan signed last month is a timid , election-year effort to shrink the fearsome federal budget deficit , expected to be about $175 billion for fiscal 1984 . The legislation aims to boost Government revenues by $50 billion over the next three years through such steps as raising liquor taxes and reducing business deductions for luxury cars . But buried in the fine print of the 751-page 1984 Deficit Reduction Act is a fundamental change in the way the tax code treats foreigners who invest in the U.S. The measure could attract more money from overseas , which would help finance the U.S. budget deficit , hold down interest rates and perhaps spark a boom in the stock and bond markets . Indeed , the rally seemed to have already started last week . <P> Up to now , foreigners who bought American bonds or other financial assets in the U.S. were subject to a 30% withholding tax on interest earned . The new legislation ends the withholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has become the largest and possibly the most alluring tax haven in the world . <P> The U.S. is already heavily dependent on foreign money . Last year alone some $86 billion poured into American investments from abroad . By enlarging the pool of capital available for lending , the inflow from overseas has helped ease pressure on interest rates . Without the foreign investment , the prime rate that U.S. banks charge corporate customers , now at 13% , might be 1 to 3 percentage points higher . <P> Foreign banks and other financial institutions have been big buyers of U.S. bonds . But most individual foreign investors , seeking to avoid the U.S. withholding tax , have favored certificates of deposit offered by overseas units of American banks and bonds issued by U.S. companies in foreign financial centers where taxes are minimal . Now that the American tax has been repealed , foreigners may develop a taste for bonds sold in the U.S. The prospect of increased foreign capital flows and stable interest rates could further fuel the bull market that was gathering force last week . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . Treasury officials want to sell foreigners more bonds as a way of reducing the interest rates that the Government pays to finance its deficit . Part of Treasury 's motivation is political . The last thing Reagan needs in an election campaign is rising interest rates . <P> The tax repeal has stirred resentment abroad . One European government official accuses the U.S. of " robbing the rest of the world of capital . " To keep from losing too much money to the U.S. , foreign countries may have to raise their interest rates . In West Germany the central bank and the Finance Ministry have suggested that the government should consider exempting foreigners from tax on its bonds as a way of countering the U.S. strategy .
