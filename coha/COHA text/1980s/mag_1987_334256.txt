Even if works of the imagination could talk , they could never testify . Being fictional , how could they swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but ? Nonetheless , a number of angry plaintiffs in recent years have brought libel suits charging that they were represented , and misrepresented , by fictional characters in stories , novels and films . The latest such suit , against the film version of Sylvia Plath 's novel The Bell Jar , ended last week with a court-endorsed settlement that sent a cautionary and somewhat paradoxical message : when you make things up , be sure to tell the truth . <P> Dr. Jane V. Anderson , who teaches psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , * contended that she was the model for Joan Gilling , a central character in both the book and the movie . Claiming that the film defamed and humiliated her by presenting Gilling as a suicidal lesbian , she brought suit in a Boston federal court . The 14 individual and corporate defendants included Plath 's widower , the British poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her novel for $60,000 , as well as the filmmakers and two television companies that showed the movie , CBS and Time Inc. ' s Home Box Office . <P> Anderson fell short of her stated goals  --  $6 million in damages and a ban on further showings of the film  --  but she won from the defendants an admission that the movie had " unintentionally defamed " her . All new copies , including new videocassettes , must now carry prominent disclaimers labeling the story as fiction . She was also awarded $150,000 , a sum that will just about cover her current legal expenses . Said her attorney , Harry L. Manion III : " We 've won a permanent record for all the world to see . " <P> Before the settlement ended the trial just prior to her cross-examination , Anderson was an impressive witness in her own behalf , vehemently denying she had ever been a lesbian . " I never , never in any way attempted to seduce Sylvia Plath into a homosexual relationship , " she told the court in unwavering tones . Referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I also never made any suicide attempts or had scars on my breast . And certainly I never hung myself . " Precisely , said defense lawyers , because the character is fictional . " Joan Gilling commits suicide , in the book and the movie , and yet Jane Anderson is here in court , " Attorney Alexander H. Pratt Jr . pointed out to the jury in his opening statement . " Obviously the character was fictitious . " <P> The law has no well-developed standard for judging the culpability of fiction ; libel rulings have been concerned mostly with news reports . Real people have served as models for fictional characters , from Proust 's Baron Charlus to Bellow 's Humboldt . An author 's weave of truth and invention is difficult to unravel , and never more so than in a semiautobiographical work like The Bell Jar , which was first published in Britain in 1963 , just a month before Plath committed suicide . The story of a young woman 's descent into madness spoke to the rising women 's movement as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel appeared in the U.S. eight years later , Plath became a cult figure .
