Reagan appeals for aid against the menace in Central America <P> One congressional committee voted to cut the military aid he requested for besieged El Salvador . Another sought to ban covert U.S. operations against the aggressive leftist regime in Nicaragua . Polls showed that few voters shared his critical concern over Central America and even fewer wanted the U.S. to become involved in the problem . Yet because he fervently believes his policies are vital to the future of the hemisphere , Ronald Reagan made a bold but politically risky appearance last week before a special joint session of Congress . " A number of times in the past years , members of Congress and the President have come together in meetings like this to resolve a crisis , " he said . " I have asked for this meeting in the hope that we can prevent one . " <P> For such a grand occasion , the financial commitment sought by Reagan seemed piddling . As he put it , " The total amount requested for aid to all of Central America in 1984 is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans will spend this year on coin-operated video games . " But failing to make such an investment , he insisted , would have dire consequences . " The national security of all the Americas is at stake in Central America . If we can not defend ourselves there , we can not expect to prevail else where . Our credibility would collapse , our alliances would crumble , and the safety of our homeland would be put at jeopardy . " <P> Whether Reagan succeeded in heading off a crisis will not be known for months , perhaps years , but his speech could only have helped . It was one of the best of his presidency , forceful yet temperate , without the belligerent anti-Soviet rhetoric that has at times made his foreign policy pronouncements seem more simplistic and militaristic than hi fact they are . " It was a model of teamwork , " exulted National Security Adviser William Clark at a meeting of Reagan 's senior staff the next morning , reflecting the White House 's jubilation over the speech . <P> The reaction on Capitol Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the possibility of becoming involved in a no-win commitment in Central America , but most members are wary of an outright confrontation with the Administration . <P> Hanging over the dispute , as well as almost every other discussion of U.S. intervention abroad for the past decade , is the chill specter of Viet Nam . Out of fear of repeating that colossal misadventure , Americans have seized hold of its lessons , perhaps inaccurately , perhaps obsessively . There is a strong aversion to undertaking any commitment to shore up threatened pro-American regimes in the Third World , no matter how strategically important they are , and a reluctance to believe that the countries of a region could topple like dominoes , no matter how compelling the evidence of spreading subversion . This is particularly true of Central America , where the political vulnerability clearly also has indigenous causes , including widespread poverty and decades of governmental ineptitude and human rights abuses . " Everyone in Congress is steeped in Viet Nam , " says Republican Congressman James Leach of Iowa . " We in Congress abdicated responsibility then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
