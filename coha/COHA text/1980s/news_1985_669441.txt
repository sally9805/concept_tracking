Now it is up to the civilians to bring the nation ' s political and social structures abreast with the economic structure. // It is a formidable task. // It falls heavily on the shoulders of Tancredo de Almeida Neves , who becomes president tomorrow as the military heads back to the barracks. // // The first civilian in the post in a generation , he has the ' ' somewhat unenviable task of launching Brazil on a new , uncharted course afloat with land mines promising to explode at virtually every juncture , ' ' to quote Carlos Castello Branco , Brazil ' s leading political analyst. // Can Brazil institute a strong democratic government in a society that for a generation has known the military as virtually the only the party ? // ' ' The answer is an unqualified yes , ' ' according to Mr. Castello Branco . He thinks political development along this line is already far advanced. // Roberto de Oliveira Campos , the military ' s first economic czar , who helped launch Brazil ' s economic revolution of 1960s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit by indirect vote , and ' ' the expected ' civilizing ' nature of the future Tancredo regime are extremely auspicious events.

' ' // All Latin American leaders are keeping close tabs on Brazil ' s shift . The giant on the continent has been slower to return to civilian rule than many of its neighbors , and voters are unlikely to get a chance to directly elect their president until at least 1988 . But Brazil ' s size and economic weight give it superpower-style influence in South America . What happens in Brazil can set a tone for the region .

Labor is agitating for better pay and better working conditions , and the church supports labor ' s demands . Both want better deals for workers and more social welfare for the poor. // Neves has not yet been able to work out any deals with labor ' s top leader , Luis Ignacio da Silva , better known as Lula. // Lula , head of the Workers ' Party , is more likely to join Rio de Janeiro Gov . Leonel Brizola in a left-wing alliance that could cause trouble for Neves . Governor Brizola , who early on had sought the presidency , talks of forming a new socialist party in Brazil - composed of his Democratic Labor Party , Lula ' s Workers ' Party , and the left wing of the Brazilian Democratic Movement , which largely back Neves .

But in the long run , some new leftist coalition is likely to emerge , analysts say. // The church itself is wary . In recent years , Catholic bishops here have become increasingly radicalized in their calls for social and political change. // Much may depend on how fast social change comes to Brazil under Neves . The problems he faces - the foreign debt , 223 percent inflation , and widespread poverty - are staggering. // Finding a way to close the rich-poor gap may well be Dr. Tancredo ' s biggest challenge. // Meanwhile , there remains some question on the future role of the generals , now that they are headed back to the barracks. // They are likely to stay out of politics for the immediate future . Top military leadership seems determined to do just that. // Gen. Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the redemocratization process were retired before the election took place . That effectively snuffed out any movement to derail the process and probably gives Neves a fairly free rein as far as the military is concerned for several years at least. // It is unlikely that there will be serious recriminations against the military , although there were plenty of human rights violations in the ' 70s . Many leading Brazilian statesmen and politicians were stripped of their political rights , a number of Brazilians lost their lives , and some 400 others simply disappeared. // But Neves , like most Brazilians , has promised to let bygones be bygones . This does not mean he condones what happened in the years of military rule . But he sees no purpose in dragging up the past as the delicate process of redemocratization takes shape. // ' ' It is better to move ahead , ' ' he said in a post-election statement . ' ' We have much to do . Let us not get tangled up with recriminations. ' ' // //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
