Anight in the Ukraine , a fast goodbye to Moscow <P> When Assistant Army Attach James Holbrook , 41 , left Moscow one day last January for a routine reconnaissance trip deep into the western Ukraine , he had no intention of partying along the way-particularly not at a bacchanal funded ( and photographed ) by the Soviet secret police . But just hours after arriving in the small city of Rovno ( pop . 167,000 ) , sources say , Holbrook 's traveling companion-a fellow U.S. Army attach-was drugged , and Holbrook himself obliged to fend off an incipient blackmail scheme . The uncompromised pah- returned to Moscow immediately . In keeping with U.S. procedure in such matters , Holbrook was whisked back to the U.S. , his 21-month-old assignment to the Soviet Union at an abrupt and curious end . <P> Most of the details of Holbrook 's Ukrainian misadventure-and exactly how far the entrapment attempt progressed before Holbrook grew suspicious and fled the party scene-remain top secret . ( The Soviets claim he was caught with a woman in his Rovno hotel room . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to compromise Holbrook , or pretending to attempt to compromise him . The leading theory among U.S. officials is that the Soviets considered Holbrook an especially acute pest : he speaks perfect Russian and had made many friends among the Soviet military . The Soviets regard the dozen or so U.S. military attaches in Moscow as little more than spies anyway . Indeed , Holbrook and his unfortunate fellow tripper-Lieut . Colonel Thomas Spencer , still among the American officers who work out of the Moscow embassy-were headed toward a particularly sensitive area : Lvov , a Soviet military headquarters city only 40 miles from the Polish border . <P> Intriguingly enough , just weeks before the Rovno incident , Holbrook was one of four Army officers recommended for a job as Vice President George Bush 's aide-de camp . Was Holbrook the target of a long-shot plot to slip a Soviet " mole " into the White House ? An attractive speculation , but doubtful . Says a State Department ex pert : " The KGB can be much slyer than this when it is really recruiting a spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligence Agency in Washington , calls the affair " an obvious no-comment situation . " But if the Soviets merely wanted to neutralize an effective military attach , then their attempt , however clumsy , was a complete success .
