Like some 170,000 lawyers before him , Michael T. Rose was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar late last month . Normally such admission is a routine step . In Rose 's case , however , it represented release from a four-year " living nightmare " that cost him , he says , " friends , clients and career and I do n't know how many sleepless nights . " What finally ended Rose 's ordeal was the same thing that began it : an unusual opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger . <P> Rose was first admitted to the Supreme Court bar in 1982 , when he was a Denver attorney . Although a majority of the court approved his application , Burger , joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , fired off a widely publicized dissent . As Burger saw it , " Rose 's professional conduct does not meet the standards the court should require . " The Chief Justice based this view on the findings of a Colorado bar investigation . Though Rose was licensed to practice law in that state in 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that initial round , a state bar investigating committee charged that among other things , Rose had misrepresented himself as being licensed to practice in Colorado . <P> Rose , 38 , who now heads a farm relief program in South Carolina , contends that the opposition of his Colorado accusers was politically motivated . A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy , Rose had created a stir in the early ' 70s with a law- review article charging the military academies with violating the rights of cadets charged with honor-code transgressions . He discussed his charges on a segment of 60 Minutes and later represented 100 West Point cadets accused of cheating . <P> Seeking to clear his name after Burger 's blast , Rose enlisted the American Civil Liberties Union and a former Associate Attorney General of the U.S. , John Shenefield . But in 1985 the Colorado Supreme Court rejected Rose 's petition to reopen his case , and earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court refused review . Undaunted , Rose flew to Washington and sought the help of former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June that he intended to retire from the court . <P> On Griswold 's advice , Rose resigned from the Supreme Court bar and then immediately reapplied , a move that forced the court to reconsider his qualifications . His new application was supported by a letter from Griswold arguing that procedures by which Rose was initially denied admission to the Colorado bar were " seriously defective . " Also attached was an affidavit from former Colorado District Court Judge Roger Cisneros , who had been on the Colorado bar investigating committee . Cisneros suggested that the committee members who voted against Rose did so because of their impression that he was " an activist . . . not the kind of person they wanted . " <P> The plan worked . The court unanimously readmitted Rose . In a brief concurrence , Burger , again joined by O'Connor , said the record now demonstrated that " the applicant is ' of good moral and professional character . ' " Burger maintained , however , that his earlier attack on Rose was justified on the basis of the information then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome proves his point . " Big people and big institutions can be wrong , " he says . " You 've got to allow for that . "
