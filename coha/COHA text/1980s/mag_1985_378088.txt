Along the corridors of Harvard Law School , professors still refer to one another as " colleagues , " but the atmosphere of late seems something less than collegial . An intellectual debate has sharpened into a feud about the shape of legal education and the legitimacy of the law itself . On one side stand the adherents of Critical Legal Studies , who charge that the American legal system and its supposedly disinterested rules are prime instruments of social injustice . On the other side are more traditional professors who contend that the faculty " crits " are waging " guerrilla warfare " at the law school . For Dean James Vorenberg , striving to stay neutral in the dispute , the result is " a tremendous sense of vibrancy and energy . " But sometimes , he acknowledges , " things get out of hand . " <P> Less gently , a dean at a rival school asserts that Harvard is now " an extremely unpleasant and politicized environment , " adding that " those who want to work on scholarship do n't want to waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cambridge institution has had unaccustomed recruiting trouble . Despite its continued prestige , Harvard has not hired any professor from another law school for a tenured position since 1981 , either because candidates have failed to win approval from the divided faculty or because those on whom compromise was finally achieved declined the offers . One professor already at the school , and affiliated with C.L.S. , has had the decision on her tenure delayed for two years . <P> During a debate before alumni on the subject earlier this year , Corporate Law Professor Robert Clark , a leading opponent of the crits , charged that they had purposively created " prolonged , intense , bitter conflict " and engaged in " a ritual slaying of the elders . " One wounded elder is Professor Paul Bator , a former U.S. deputy solicitor general . After 26 years at Harvard , he is moving in January to the more congenial precincts of the University of Chicago Law School , a redoubt of legal conservatism . Calling the C.L.S . movement a force for " philistinism " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic excellence of Harvard are at stake . " On that , " he has declared , " there is no right or left . Only right and wrong . " <P> Critical Legal Studies was born during the late 1960s among a group of student activists and younger faculty at Yale Law School . By 1977 C.L.S . adherents had formed a network that now has about 400 members . Its annual conference today attracts roughly 1,000 participants . Proponents hold positions at some of the nation 's most prestigious legal institutions , including Stanford and George-town . But with three of the best-known crits  --  Duncan Kennedy , Morton Horwitz and Roberto Unger  --  among those on its 64-member faculty , Harvard has become the leading C.L.S . center . " The battle is fiercer here than elsewhere , " says Kennedy , who jokingly refers to himself and the others as " the unholy triumvirate . " Less a coherent philosophy than an angle of inquiry , C.L.S . has roots in " legal realism , " whose supporters in the 1920s and ' 30s began to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most cases , and that judicial decisions depended less on the abstract " science " of law than on judges ' personal predispositions , beliefs and prejudices .
