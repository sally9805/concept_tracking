Think about how hot it has been all summer . Now imagine strapping on football pads and helmets and practicing twice a day in the heat . Chicago-area football coaches already have considered it , and the weather has forced some of them to rethink time-honored practice habits . " I was out at the fieldhouse Thursday , and it was unbelievably humid , " said Jack Lewis , the veteran Immaculate Conception coach . " I ' ve never seen it this bad in 30 years . " Practice officially begins Monday in what are traditionally the dog days of mid-August . But the extreme heat , with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees combined with high humidity , has been a cause of concern for some coaches . The forecast for the next week calls for-and here ' s a surprise-hot , humid weather . " We always take heat and its effect on the players into account , " said Jim Boyter , coach of defending Class 5A state champion Joliet Catholic . " We keep track of their weight and give them water breaks when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t plan to change the practice schedule . Because several assistant coaches work at other schools , Joliet Catholic is limited to working out in the late afternoon . " And the first three days , we can ' t work out in pads anyway , " says Boyter . ( Illinois High School Association rules prohibit contact drills until after the fourth day . ) " It ' s mostly walk through and teaching . " Lewis has never altered his schedule in 30 years-always practicing from 9 to 11 a. m. and again from 1 to 3 p. m. in the time before school begins . " I always said : ' We have to play at 1 or 2 o ' clock . That ' s when we ' ll practice , ' " he said . " I may have to back away from that one . " Todd Wernet of St. Rita thinks that the key to his players ' making it through the heat is conditioning . " If they ' re in decent shape , they should be okay , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita starts school Aug. 22 , a week from Monday , they can only have two-a-day practices for a week . " Thursday and Friday , with the pads , we ' ll have to watch because a player can drop a lot of weight , " Wernet said . " The down time ( in between practices ) is also important . We ' ll probably practice from 8 : 30 to 11 ( a. m. ) and come back at 2 . If these kids have a poor diet-fried foods , no breakfast-they ' re not going to feel very good . And that ' s the case no matter what the weather . " The focus on a nutritious diet marks how much the game has changed . Twenty years ago , water was thought to be a no-no on the practice field . " I can remember when the experts used to say the kids would get cramps or get sick if they drank water , " said Lewis . " Now we ' ll have hoses on standby , and they can get water as often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Buffalo Grove coach Grant Blaney , whose school will have two weeks of double sessions because classes don ' t begin until the 29th , says they ' ll eliminate the evening portion . " We ' re fortunate , because most of our kids only play one way , " said Blaney , whose school is in Class 6A , for the state ' s largest schools . " And our practices are short and snappy . Our actual time on the field is only about two hours . " And Blaney says maybe not even that long . " On those 90-90 days ( 90 degrees and 90 percent humidity ) , there ' s nothing wrong with going an hour or so , " he said . " After about an hour-and- a-half , the law of diminishing returns sets in . You won ' t get anything out of it ( the extra time ) and you may even go backwards . " After all , it ' s still just a game. "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
