In a briefing by several officials , F. Allen Harris , director of the State Department ' s emergency refugee operations office , said he had just returned from witnessing a human tide of some 50 , 000 men , women and children walking from the Ethiopian provinces of Eritrea and Tigre on two separate routes . The two provinces , hard hit by the drought in eastern Africa , also have secessionist movements hostile to the Government in Addis Ababa. // Mr. Harris said there was a confirmed report that Ethiopian Air Force planes attacked a refugee trail on Dec. 7 , killing 18 and wounding 53 . Princeton Lyman , a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs , said the Ethiopians might have thought these were armed insurgents on the move. // The first refugee trail goes from Ethiopia to the Sudanese town of Kassala , and the second to the town of Sefawa , farther south , Mr. Harris said . <> <> Thousands Reach Border Daily // // He said that " thousands " of Ethiopians were reaching the border area daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow would stop . There are estimated to be about three million people living in Tigre and Eritrea , he said. // " What we know is that people are hungry , and because they are hungry they keep moving , " Mr. Harris said . " I don ' t think we expect all the three million people to move . We don ' t have a good understanding of how many people may move. " // State Department officials have refused to comment on what if any aid the United States was giving to rebel relief organizations in the contested Ethiopian provinces . But according to Western diplomatic sources , the United States , with the help of private charity organizations , has been quietly funneling food to these areas for the last year. // The sources said 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 metric tons of food have been shipped to Sudanese ports and then carried by truck to the rebellion-affected provinces for distribution . The sources , who requested anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the effort , said that while the Ethiopian Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would block future shipments if the effort was widely publicized. // After crossing the border , the refugees are being gathered in reception centers , Mr. Harris said . One is at Wad Sherifie , east of Kassala . In August , he said , there were 4 , 500 refugees in that camp . But last week the number had risen to 33 , 000 , all of them Eritreans . The camp had temporarily run out of water and was so short of food that it could admit no new refugees. // <> <> Measles Epidemic Breaks Out // A measles epidemic had broken out in the camp , affecting children particulalry . Mr. Harris said that normal children rarely die from measles , but that when they are malnourished and fatigued , as they were after a trek as long as 30 or 40 days , the mortality rate was high. // About 34 , 000 more refugees from Tigre Province were living at Tekl el Bab , also east of Kassala . This was not a camp , he said , " but a John Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the open along the base of a mountain. // At Sefawa , there are 26 , 000 people , with 5 , 000 more being held at the border , awaiting accommodations . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has moved 9 , 000 from Sefawa to a place called El Fau , 180 miles to the west , where there is an irrigation site with water. // James N. Purcell , the director of the State Department ' s bureau for refugee programs , said a total of 100 , 000 Ethiopians had gone to the Sudan since September . Another 100 , 000 refugees have arrived in the western Sudan from Chad , also since September . Before then there were already about 450 , 000 Ethiopians , 200 , 000 Ugandans and several thousand Chadians in the Sudan , many of whom had moved into towns. // Mr. Purcell said that even though the Ethiopians were going to the Sudan for help , the Sudan itself is " suffering from drought and a weakened economy . " But its roads and airfields make it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> U.S. Pledged $39. 8 Million // // The United Nations estimated last summer that the program for refugees in Africa in 1985 would cost about $142 million , of which $38. 7 million was allocated to the Sudan , Mr. Purcell said . In October the United States pledged $39. 8 million for African refugees. // But he said that " because of the great increase in persons fleeing drought and civil strife in several African countries , " the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had issued special appeals for additional funds . Last Friday he asked for $11. 8 million in emergency help for Ethiopians in the Sudan. // M. Peter McPherson , Director of the Agency for International Development , said that after a conference with President Reagan Saturday morning , an initial American shipment in an Air Force C-141 left for an airfield at Kassala . It arrived on Sunday with eight large water tanks , 3 , 200 blankets and six hospital tents , Mr. Purcell said. // On Tuesday a second military flight arrived in Khartoum , the Sudanese capital , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-gallon water jugs , 160 rolls of waterproof plastic sheeting and 607 bales and boxes of blankets , he said . It was taken by truck on an eight-hour trip to Kassala . <> <> Measles Vaccine Arrives // // In addition , on Monday a commercial aircraft carrying enough measles vaccine to innoculate 100 , 000 people arrived in Khartoum . The vaccine was donated by Merck Sharpe &; Dohme , through the Save the Children group , Mr. Purcell said. // Another military flight is due to arrive in Kassala on Sunday carrying 22 metric tons of powdered milk for emergency feeding of children , Mr. Harris said . He said that when children were malnourished , it was impossible for them to handle dry bread and cereal , the normal diet . They have to be started on the road to recovery through the milk preparation , he said. // Overall , Mr. McPherson said , the United States since Oct. 1 has contributed about $269 million to famine relief in Africa , mostly in food . Of that amount , he said , $122 million was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for continuing the airlift for a long period . He said the needs in the Sudan could be handled through ships docking at Port Sudan . Ships were being diverted to the area with food shipments originally destined for India and other places , he said. // //
