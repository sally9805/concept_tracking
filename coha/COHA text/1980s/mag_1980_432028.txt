 | Its hewn oaken logs silvered by age , the old Shope homestead near here stands empty now , a symbol of all that Appalachia was ? and a warning of what it may become . The 130-year-old cabin , home to generations of the pioneering Shope family , is miles from the nearest paved road , surrounded by a mountain wilderness of hemlock , poplar and slash pine . Despite its remoteness , the historic place is destined to become a sales office for Florida speculators who bought the land and plan to build a community of expensive vacation homes . Such may be the fate of much of Appalachia 's Southern Highlands over the next decade . In recent years , land developers have flocked to the area , joining coal and timber interests in buying property that once was dirt-cheap . Today , according to one study , 75 percent or the land around Gatlinburg , Tenn. , and Highlands , N.C. , already is owned by people who do n't live there year-round . In places like Rabun County , Ga. , where large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is under way between land speculators and those who fear the region is fast losing its unique flavor . Sharpening the conflict is the fact that only 20 percent of the land here is available for farms and homes for the natives . The rest is in government and corporate hands . The Highlands , at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains , includes some of the most scenic parts of North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia and Tennessee . Novelist James Dickey set his best seller Deliverance here , and the movie version was filmed on the nearby Chattooga River . It is an area of deep blue lakes , dense woods , wildflowers and small , sleepy towns tucked back in mist-shrouded mountains . There are places here where life has changed little in this century ? where dogs are still trained to hunt bear and homes are built from logs and split-cedar shingles . Yet from Main Street in Clayton , the seat of Rabun County , one looks to the east these days and sees Screamer Mountain 's granite face scarred with dirt roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , the peaks above Betty 's Creek are threaded by ski trails . Not long ago , the slopes were home to people who eked out a precarious existence hunting and trapping , farming the hollows and bottoms and making moonshine . " Everywhere you look in Appalachia , the land is being bought by outsiders , " says Eliot Wigginton , editor of the best-selling Foxfire books , which chronicle mountain culture and folkways . " In Kentucky and West Virginia , the buyers are the energy corporations . Here , and in North Carolina and Tennessee , land developers have arrived in force . They 're irresistible forces . " A Playground for the Wealthy So widespread has vacation-home development become that old-time mountaineers worry about obliteration of the remnants of a centuries-old culture . At Wayne 's Hideaway Bar and Grill in Mountain City , Ga. , locals drink beer into the night and gloomily forecast the day when they will be landless in a country where their ancestors owned vast stretches of property . " We 're getting crowded by outsiders now , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years alongside an apple orchard on top of Scaley Mountain . Rising from a makeshift couch , Webb threw a hickory log into the stove and looked out a window at the mountains around him . Sky Valley , a popular ski resort , covers most of the next peak . " Used to be , you 'd find a sort of peace in being up here apart from others , " he said . " At night now , you look out , and the hillsides are all lighted up . People from Florida and Atlanta and everywhere are up here now . I wonder where it 'll end ? what 'll happen to the life we know up here . " People from all over the Eastern Seaboard are coming here in steadily mounting numbers , drawn by the area 's rugged beauty , cool summers , snowy Currier and Ives winters ? and its closeness to big cities . By car , Atlanta is but 2 hours away , Washington a day 's drive . Nearby Asheville , N.C. , and Greenville , S.C. , both have modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Four-lane interstate highways crisscross the Blue Ridge , bringing the once-isolated region even closer to other large metropolitan areas . Until developers began arriving in large numbers 15 years ago , land often sold for $150 an acre and an entire mountain could be bought for $5,000 . The bottoms were used for growing cabbage and corn , the forested peaks for hunting , the streams for fishing . Many mountaineers lived largely off the land , as their ancestors had before them . But the region 's poverty was great and , because of it , many people sold their land . The outskirts of Knoxville , Chattanooga and Atlanta are full of former residents of Appalachia living in mobile homes bought with money from the sale of land . More property was sold by elderly people whose children had departed for jobs in the North , leaving no one to whom they could pass it on . Family farms were carved up and resold as quarter-acre  | page deleted  | lots . Taxes inevitably rose sharply even for remote property that could never be properly developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Land Prices Are Soaring Land is now so expensive in the Southern Highlands ? as much as $5,000 for an acre lot with a view ? that few natives can afford to buy . " That may not be a lot of money to someone in Atlanta or New Orleans who makes $40,000 a year , " said a teacher at the Rabun County High School , " but for most of these people subsisting on minimum wages it means they will never own land . Those who went away to Detroit to earn money for land ca n't come back . They ca n't afford it . " AWailable factory jobs in this part of Appalachia are nonunion , mostly paying the minimum wage . The situation is accelerating the flight of young people despite the highly uncertain future they face elsewhere . Few jobs are to be found these days on the auto-assembly lines of Detroit , which after World War II offered employment to tens of thousands of mountaineers . " If I had my way , I 'd stay here and raise cows because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 17-year-old high-school senior . " But the way it looks now , I wo n't be able to find land , and jobs are hard to get . My kinfolk in Detroit say there 's nothing there for me , either . I 'll have to pick up and go down south , maybe to Florida . " Just that morning , the rented land on which he and his father kept dairy cows was sold ? to a developer . For all its detractors , development is welcomed by business people and officials across Appalachia . Higher taxes raise money for schools , roads , hospitals and services badly needed in the impoverished region . The influx of well-to-do outsiders means more money spent in local businesses as well as creation of new construction jobs . " To hear some people talk , we 've come in here and raped the land and spoiled everything , " said a developer in Banner Elk , N.C. , where many vacation homes have been built . " That 's bunk . Some have been ripoff artists , but most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not ruin it . And we twisted no arms to get people to sell . We 've been good for the area . " But even boosters worry about where development will end . Said William Jarrett , executive director of the Rabun County Chamber of Commerce : " I 've been here 23 years and I remember how it was . Now I look around and worry a little about how you control it . You ca n't fight progress but , still , you wonder . The old ways of the mountains are passing fast , no doubt about it . " The Mountaineer : Proud and Independent Anyone who looks hard enough can find traces of the past . A moonshiner in Rabun County 's War Woman section makes smooth corn liquor the way his forebears made it 150 years ago ? and sells it as fast as it can be bottled . For many in these parts , it is still the drink of choice . And there is Kenny Runion , bright-eyed and snowyhaired at 83 , sitting alone in the primitive two-room house he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Runion is a legendary character in the mountains ? famous for his stories , his way with herbal medicine , and his masterly carving of chairs , walking sticks , rings and wooden " riddles , " as he calls them . His pride shows in his chairs , made out of mountain laurel , a wood so hard that nails bend in the driving . He painstakingly drills small holes , then pegs all the pieces together . Curved parts are soaked in water , then warped to shape . It is a world apart from the assembly-line operations of a modern-day furniture factory , and Runion is one of the few who still know how to do it the old way . " You ca n't hurry this kind of work , " he says . " Young boys these days do n't have the patience for it . They want everything to be done right that minute . And if they ca n't do it with a machine , then they do n't care if it gets done at all . I make a mighty pretty rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing wrong , I throw it on the junk pile . A rocker I made 30 years ago looks as pretty today . " Runion , too , typifies the self-reliance that is common here . Generally , he treats himself for sickness : Yellowroot and butterfly weed for colds and fevers , tea made from pennyroyal for chills , burdock-root tea to " purify the blood " and pokeberry wine for aching bones . He went to a doctor with his flu this winter and has regretted it ever since . " I 'd be well now if I 'd dosed myself , " he says . Doing it yourself remains a strong tradition in Appalachia , partly out of necessity , partly out of pride and a spirit of independence . " You make do with what you have , and if that wo n't get it , then you figure out a way to make it work , " says Webb . A skilled carpenter and musician , Webb preserves the art of making banjos out of a straight-necked gourd and intricately carved fingerboards for store-bought banjos out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child on snowbound days , learning to cover the banjo head with groundhog hide and making the fingerboard out of walnut . Down the mountain from Webb and just as independent is Addie Norton , who lives in a tin-roofed house her husband built for her a half century ago in leafy Mulberry Hollow . Though in her 80s , Mrs. Norton is still vigorous enough to grow much of her own food . Her garden is small , but the yield high ? the result , she says , of planting " by the signs . " On a living-room wall is tacked a large calendar from the Bryant Funeral Home of Franklin , N.C. , on which the 12 signs of the zodiac are combined with crop-planting advice . " Plant corn when the moon ai n't right , and you 'll have noaccount corn , " says Aunt Addie , as she likes to be called . " My corn is always good . Ignore the signs when you plant your beans , they 'll rot on you . Same thing true of health . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head , you 'll bleed to death ? " Cheerful most of the time , what she sees in the mountains nowadays makes her sad . She points at Mulberry Mountain , and incredulously tells of a Florida man who bought the top of it and fenced it off . Children no longer hunt squirrels and quail on the mountain , and the old-timers who lived there are all gone now . Editor Wigginton worries that with the eventual passing of the likes of Kenny Runion , Leonard Webb and Aunt Addie Norton , an important part of America will go , too . " The best part of Appalachia may die with them , " he says . Others see what has happened over the past few years and believe the day is nearly at hand when Appalachia ? at least this part ? becomes one vast resort where the natives are curiosities .
