A $914 million tax suit sheds new light on the Newhouse empire <P> No American newspaper publisher was more acquisitive , or more secretive about his business affairs , than Samuel Irving Newhouse . By the time of his death in 1979 , at the age of 84 , Newhouse had amassed a nationwide communications empire that included not only newspapers but magazines , radio and television stations , printing companies and delivery services . His 31 daily newspapers had a total readership of more than 3 million , making them the third largest U.S. chain after Gannett and Knight-Ridder . But the value of those immense holdings remained a well-kept family secret that outsiders could only guess at . <P> Now , however , the Internal Revenue Service is shining a spotlight on the inner workings of the Newhouse empire . In what is by far the largest U.S. action of its kind , the IRS is charging that Newhouse 's heirs and advisers grossly undervalued his estate at the time of his death . As a result , says the IRS , the Newhouse family owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That sum is more than 20% greater than the $750 million that the IRS collected from all estate tax cases in 1982 . <P> To buttress its case , the agency has placed in evidence voluminous documents that spell out details of the family business never before made public . They indicate that the holdings acquired by Newhouse , the son of poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe , have grown into America 's biggest family-owned media conglomerate . After two years spent interviewing Newhouse executives and studying financial records , IRS Appraiser Joseph Baniewicz put a value of $1.23 billion on the estate at the time of the publisher 's death . Sons Donald , 53 , and Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. , 55 , who seem to have inherited their father 's workaholic habits and zeal for expansion , have since added enterprises like Random House and a string of cable-television companies , while selling off radio and TV stations . <P> Such moves , together with the growing value of many Newhouse newspapers and magazines , have led some analysts to estimate that the family holdings may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 , or some $3 billion . By comparison , Hearst Newspapers , the next largest family-held concern , has an estimated total value of some $1.3 billion . <P> The IRS evaluation of the Newhouse estate was wildly at odds with the family 's appraisal . That assessment , made by Chemical Bank and the Wall Street firm Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , put the estate 's taxable value at $90.9 million and calculated the taxes owed at $48.7 million . The IRS , on the other hand , said that according to its evaluation of the estate , the heirs owed taxes of $609 million . The Government added $305 million to that tab in the form of fraud penalties for willful undervaluation of Newhouse 's holdings .
