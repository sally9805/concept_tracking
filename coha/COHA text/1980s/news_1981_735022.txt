txt Q  --  We are a married couple in our late 200 , expecting our first child in two months . Like many others , we are anxious to purchase a home , it Is hoped , next spring . We have $30,000 In United States Treasury bills and $5,000 In a money market mutual fund . We should be able to save another 615,000 by the time we buy our'house . Will it be advantageous to make a hefty down payment to reduce our monthly mortgage payments ? Or will it be better to put the minimum down to get a larger income tax deduction on higher mortgage interest charges ? A  --  The answer to that perennial set of questions depends on two other questions . What interest %Oil you pay on the mortgage ? What income can your money earn elsewhere ? If the mortgage interest will be higher than the interest or dividends your money can earn , it will be smart to reduce your mortgage . Although the interest paid on a mortgage and other debts can be taken as an itemized deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends on your savings and investments are taxable . By the time you buy a home , you may find that the interest you pay on your mortgage will be higher than the interest and dividends your money can earn . And that situation could prevail over the life of your mortgage . Why ? Because of new types of mortgages now coming into vogue , called ' " adjustable mortgage loans " and " adjustable rate mortgages . " They 're different than the familiar fixed-rate mortgages , on which the interest is set at the beginning and never changes . With a new adjustable mortgage , the interest rate can be changed up or down ? usually once a year ? in line w th interest rate changes in the moneynrnarket . Q -- We are over 65 , retired , and have just said our home . We have decided to rent , for at least a year , before buying a new home . which , In year ' opinion , would he the better thing to do with the money from tho sale of our former home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 182-day savings certificate ? A -- As I write this , the yields on money market mutual funds are quite a bit higher than those on 182-day savings certificates . The yields on money funds can move up or down . The yield on a 142-day certificate remains unchanged . If you believe interest rates are going to fall , you can lock in the current rate on a 182-day certificate by putting your money into one of those certificates and be sure of getting that yield for nearly six months . If you believe interest rates are going to rise , stay where they are , or at least not drop sharply , your money will earn more in a money market mutual fund . I 'm not copping out , but there is a lot of guesswork in this . No one can tell , for sure , where interest rates are headed over the next six to 12 months , In your shoes , however , I 'd opt for the money fund .                @ @ @ @ @
