Water-skiers , strapped to parachutes the shape of huge orange poppies , lifted out of the sea . Celebrities like the Rev. Jesse Jackson , whose time had come to abandon San Francisco ' s oratorical trance for Monte Carlo ' s halls of chance , joined the summer ' s slow parade. // If you could put an afternoon in vitro , Monaco ' s public relations people would probably have found the glass to preserve a couple from the last weekend . This summer , after all , has been hard on the local institutional image : the public relations warriors fought and lost Monte Carlo ' s Battle of the Magazine Covers - the principality ' s failed attempt to enjoin the publication of pictures showing Princess Stephanie , as the captions put it , " torn between passion and good sense . " <> <> A Story in Installments // // The Grimaldi family in the princely palace of pink and yellow built on a crest at the edge of the Mediterranean seems to want its existence and Monaco to be portrayed as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French press - and in view of its circulation figures , for a significant segment of the French themselves - the family has become a kind of Dallas/ Falcon Crest/Kennedy saga of regular weekly installments , marriages , deaths , annulments requested , perfect happiness denied. // Sometimes , the palace complains and threatens and sues . The magazines reply that their reporting has helped to keep Monaco alive , and some of their editors also wonder if the family does not find some kind of fascination in seeing their activities constantly relayed back at them , in still-life , laid out like a frieze , month after month. // So far this year , Paris-Match has published nine Monaco-oriented covers , and , by comparison , one concerning President Francois Mitterrand . <> <> Photos at Long Range // // Paris-Match ' s best-selling issue followed the death two years ago of Princess Grace , and circulation went up 5 percent two weeks ago when it published photos taken with a long-range camera of Princess Stephanie , 19 years old , that seemed to illustrate the idea that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the son of France ' s most popular movie star , for Anthony Delon , 19 , the son of the film actor the French seem to consider as the synthesis of wildness , rage and passion. // The celebrity of the three prompted Tim , the editorial cartoonist of l ' Express , to draw them this week , reclining in the manner of the naked woman and two male friends of " Le Dejeuner sur l ' Herbe , " Manet ' s mocking painting that scandalized Paris 120 years ago. // Jours de France was in the game too , but respectfully - it stayed away from Stephanie , in a swim suit , cradling Mr. Delon in her arms , but offered an official-looking evening gown cover shot of the Princess , taken in front of a portrait of her mother . Radio , always blind , but voiceless too since it was without access to any of the participants , stuck to phone-in programs in which listeners explained who Stephanie should choose . <> <> ' Didn ' t Invent Any of It ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief of Paris-Match , " it is our ' Dallas , ' our serial , and they are our Kennedys , and we didn ' t invent any of it . The scenario is beyond belief , but do you think someone at Match told Grace Kelly ' s daughter to dump Belmondo ' s son and throw her arms around Delon ' s son , who just happens to have been convicted for car theft and having a pistol ? No , we just published the pictures . And did we tell Anthony Delon the next week to wreck his Mercedes at the Belgian border ? No. // " We have nothing against these people , " he went on , " it ' s just that we ' re married to them in a way . Before it was Caroline , now it ' s Stephanie . Everybody knows everybody , millions of us . The public has invested in this story . It participates , it judges , it condemns , it pities . It ' s a second life for a lot of people . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hah ! " // In the past , the palace has sued anyone who tried to compromise its vision of itself , once instructing a lawyer to go to court to stop a stripper from calling herself Caroline of Monaco. // On other occasions , it has briefly hunkered down , or exerted pressure where it could : the publishers of a book called " Le Prince " said they found out they could not buy advertising space in the regional press . The reason was that their sun-tan-oil novel , a kind of roman a clef , was about a principality called Montesoro , its Prince Ruggiero and his wife , Princess Kate , the former American opera star , and blackmail , sex , thievery and big money . <> <> Tried to Stop Pictures // // A strong attempt was made to stop publication of the pictures of Stephanie and Mr. Delon , who was described by his lawyer as a " languid Adonis " when he received an eight-month suspended sentence last year for stealing a car and having a pistol without a permit. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Belmondo , described as gentle , kind , palace-approved and a wearer of polished loafers , being replaced , at least for the time being , by Delon , a darker , troubled young man who said last month , " I don ' t have any relationship with my father. " // The princely family ' s attempt to have an injunction issued in Paris against the pictures appearing in Paris-Match on the ground of invasion of privacy was rejected by a judge , who noted a point of irony : after all , the princess and the young man were photographed " entwined in tender insolence , " in Match ' s phrase , at a public beach down the road from here. // " I don ' t think the anyone tracks gangsters the way they go after the family , " says Nadia Lacoste , the family spokesman , who insists that the pursuit is intolerable in two ways . <> <> ' You Lose on Both Ends ' // // " First , " she said , " regardless of the picture , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . Second , the problem is that when you appear so often , the public starts thinking you love the publicity . They can ' t realize the family has nothing to do with it . So you lose on both ends. " // Mr. Therond said the real truth was that over a period of 20 years , the magazines and the principality have always figured out ways to kiss and make up . Both , he said , understand their need for each other. // Last week , the understanding seemed to be working again . Match said its next issue would feature Prince Albert , the uncontroversial future reigning prince . Did Match ' s reporters talk to Albert ? Mr. Therond was asked // " Sure , " he said . " He gave us an interview . What else did you think ? " // //
