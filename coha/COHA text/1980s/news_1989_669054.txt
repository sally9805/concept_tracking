A federal judge has agreed to a plan to reduce Chicago ' s ozone levels gradually over the next two decades rather than force sudden , draconian measures on area drivers . With the approval of Judge Terence Evans in Milwaukee , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will drop plans for far-reaching restrictions on vehicle use , including the possibility of gas rationing or mandating the sale of alternative-fuel cars . A long list of regulations on such small businesses as gas stations and dry cleaners and on big businesses such as refineries and steel mills also was under consideration . Instead , the agreement approved last week by Evans calls for the EPA , Illinois , Wisconsin , Indiana and Michigan to pool $12 million for a sophisticated computer study of the ozone problem in 60 counties around the southern half of Lake Michigan . Results of that study will determine what kind of controls need to be instituted to bring down ozone levels . That plan will be ready by September , 1994 , and will be phased in by 2010 . The consent decree settles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin accused the EPA of not forcing Illinois to reduce ozone levels in Chicago . Evans ruled last January that the EPA had until next March to put together a set of regulations to reduce Chicago-area ozone , which Wisconsin said was drifting across the state line and threatening the health of residents in Kenosha and Racine Counties . Ozone , a corrosive form of oxygen , forms on hot , sunny days when a mixture of chemicals , almost half of which come from vehicle emissions , cook in the atmosphere . It is especially dangerous for the young , the elderly , and people with respiratory ailments . It can also corrode metal and destroy plants . The EPA was prepared to announce specifics of its wide-ranging scheme this month so that the agency would have enough time for hearings before making the plan final by the March deadline . Critics said flawed data would result in too restrictive a plan , but the agency responded that it did not have enough time to collect more reliable information . " The kinds of measures we were looking at were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the EPA ' s air and radiation division in Chicago , said Tuesday . " We ' re sighing something of a breath of relief because of the fear we had that the plan would have been counterproductive by generating a lot of bad public reaction . " As a condition of the settlement , Evans ordered the EPA to make progress reports every six months to ensure that all parties are abiding by the agreement . The four states that will conduct the ozone study have formed a nonprofit organization , the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium , to carry out the research . Preliminary studies around the region will begin next summer , with full-scale field work scheduled for summer , 1991 . In the meantime , some previously announced efforts to cut emissions of ozone-forming chemicals will continue , Kee said . The EPA will continue to push Illinois to beef up its vehicle inspection program . Illinois already has proposed a variety of measures , including expanding the area covered by the program to include more of the metropolitan area and the addition of tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converter . If the General Assembly does not approve some kind of expanded emissions testing program next spring , the federal government will slash an estimated $350 million from the money it gives the state for highway projects . Also , the EPA will proceed with new regulations for pollution-fighting equipment at some big industrial sites , and the continued replacement of old , pollution-producing vehicles with newer , cleaner cars and trucks will further reduce ozone levels . Some measures in the Bush administration ' s proposed Clean Air Act , such as hoses on gas pumps to recover escaping gas fumes , would fight ozone , too . " We ' re not stopping progress by agreeing to this settlement , " Kee said . " On balance , we may not make progress quite as fast , but we won ' t have the backlash we might have had from the public . " The agreement does not stop measures before the Illinois Pollution Control Board to cut ozone by requiring even cleaner cars and less evaporative gasoline.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
