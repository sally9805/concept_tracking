Two members of TIME 'S Board of Economists have close ties to two of this year 's presidential nominees . Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford , is now a strategist for Ronald Reagan ; Walter Heller , who was President Kennedy 's chief economic aide , is an occasional consultant to Jimmy Carter . During a luncheon discussion last week , the two economists debated their candidates ' policies . Some highlights : <P> ON THE BUDGET . Greenspan : The budget is severely out of sync . Reagan 's program would hold federal revenues to less than 21% of G.N.P . in 1985 . Carter 's proposal accepts a huge rise in the tax burden to nearly 24% of G.N.P . This is a turning point in American history ; unless we choke off budget growth , we can not rebuild the economy . <P> Heller : What budget cuts has Reagan specified ? None except the elimination of waste , extravagance , abuse and outright fraud . I call those the four horsemen of the budget apocalypse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotted out by every presidential challenger . No more than $4 billion could be saved that way . Until Reagan gives us chapter and verse on what programs he will cut and by how much , his balanced-budget pledge is no more than a pious hope . It 's a little cruel to call this voodoo economics , as George Bush apparently did . I 'd call it Indian-rope-trick economics or Houdini economics . <P> ON THE GOVERNMENT 'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY . Greenspan : The President 's Economic Revitalization Board is a bad mistake . At the White House door will appear not progressive new industries , but companies on the verge of bankruptcy . In our political system this board can be nothing other than a bailout operation . Carter 's plan would gradually increase Government control of the economy . <P> Heller : I 'm not wild about the Revitalization Board idea either , but a governmental hands-off approach can be carried too far . I 've heard nothing about Reagan 's wage and price policy . Without wage and price restraint , no strategy against inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marketplace-the same discipline that has GM , Ford and Chrysler raising prices in the face of the slowest summer auto sales in almost 20 years . <P> ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION . Heller : Carter has the record on his side . Deregulation of airlines , trucking , banking and telecommunications , goals that we have been struggling toward for almost 20 years . <P> Greenspan : Some of these deregulation efforts were started during the Ford Administration , but I do applaud the progress Carter has made . My only difficulty is that during the President 's first three years in office , the number of pages of regulations in the Federal Register went up 35% . <P> ON CARTER 'S MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY . Heller : The President 's inflation record is not good , but he has added some 8 million jobs during his term . Industrial output has risen faster than in any country except Japan . He 's shown political guts : no tax cuts in 1980 and only modest , business-oriented ones in 1981.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
