Ten years later , the point remains : Not even a President is above the law <P> A few weeks ago , a handful of survivors of the Titanic came together in a Philadelphia hotel to observe the 70th anniversary of the sinking . They fetched out their memories of that night and passed them around like photographs . They gazed at a few forlorn relics of the voyage : Mrs. John Jacob Astor 's life jacket , a battered deck chair , other odds and ends from the unsinkable " Floating Palace " before it went down . <P> It will be ten years next week since a security guard named Frank Wills discovered a piece of tape on the latch of a door in the Watergate complex in Washington . He called the police , and thereby began the destruction of Richard Nixon 's presidency . The survivors of Watergate will not be holding reunions . No one died at Watergate , of course , as the bumper stickers say-meaning , rather heavily , that Chappaquiddick was worse . But 25 people went to jail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the White House one step ahead of impeachment . <P> That kind of disgrace does not encourage nostalgia . In an interview last week with Diane Sawyer of CBS , Nixon said , " Remember Lot 's wife . Never look back ! " He suggested that those who obsessively revisit Watergate may suffer from " Narcissus complexes . " Nixon and the others from his crew ( most of whom he threw overboard at the last moment , the captain struggling to be the last to go ) will never gather at some hotel in , say , San Clemente , to share memories and souvenirs-enemies lists , voice-activated taping systems , smoking guns , the moral compasses that they lost . <P> Watergate was an American morality play . The Constitution was the hero . That was Watergate 's simplest and purest dimension . But it was fascinatingly more than that . It was one of the nation 's most complicated psychological and cultural experiences . The multiple levels and facets of it ( somewhat like the levels and intricacies of Nixon 's character ) give Watergate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great personages from high places , " the critic George Steiner has written , " gave to medieval politics their festive and brutal character . Such cases made explicit the universal drama of the fall of man . " Watergate had both its grubbiness and its universality . It was a quagmire and a catharsis . It was a mystery story with splendidly bizarre obscurities of plot . It was a national psychodrama , a spectacle of immense power that the Senate committee hearings dramatized as a daytime soap . ( Viewers actually called in to the television networks to suggest changes of script or pace , as though they were indeed watching a political serial. )
