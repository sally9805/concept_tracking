 |p710  and after a while I became curious about the route of a certain train out of Amritsar . This particular mail train left Amritsar at ten in the evening and headed south on the main line to Delhi ; but halfway there it made a hairpin turn at Ambala and raced north to Kalka where , at dawn , it connected with the railcar to Simla . It was an extraordinary route ? and a very fast train : Instead of going to bed in the hotel , I could reserve a sleeper , board the train , and more or less wake up in the foothills of the Himalayas , in Simla . It was not a popular train , this Simla Mail . Its odd twisted route was undoubtedly the result of the demands of the imperial postal service , for the British regarded letter writing and mail delivery as one of the distinguishing features of any great civilization . And Indians feel pretty much the same . My sleeping car was unswept ; like a cell , it had barred windows @#  |p711  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket collector said , " and do n't leave any small articles lying around . " The whistle of the Simla Mail drowned the sounds of music from the bazaar . I was soon asleep . But at midnight I was awakened by rain beating on the shutters . The monsoon that had hit Punjab only the day before had brought another storm , and the train struggled through it . The thick raindrops came down so hard they spattered through the slats and louvers in the shutters and a fine spray soaked the compartment floor . The guard knocked on the door at 5:20 to announce that we had arrived at Kalka . It was cool and green at Kalka , and after a shave in the Gentlemen 's Waiting Room I was ready for the five-hour journey through the hills to Simla . I could have taken the small pottering Simla Queen or the express , but the white 20-seat railcar was already  |p712  waiting at the platform . I boarded , and snoozed , and woke to see mists lying across the hills and heavy green foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5,000 feet we came to the little station at Barog , where every day the railcar waits while the passengers have breakfast ; and then it sets off again into the low tumbling cloud . Occasionally the cloud and mist were broken by a shaft of light ; and parted to reveal a valley floor thousands of feet below . The opinion of the Indian in the hill station is that the plains are disorderly and crime ridden : As soon as people climb above three or four thousand feet , they tend to behave themselves . The train guard at Simla station was full of complaints about lowland vandalism and tardiness and " mischief ? especially political mischief " on the railways . " You 're very frank , sir , " I said . " It is because I have resigned , " he replied . The residents of Simla , where once the high officials of the raj and their ladies went to escape the hot season , are often visited by relatives . " They always say , I 'm coming for two or three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there is something about this air that excites them and makes them difficult . " The man speaking was an army colonel . He had a remedy for unwelcome guests . He made lists of sights that were not to be missed in Simla . Each one was a day 's walk from his house , and it was usually at the top of a steep hill . After a few days of this sightseeing , the starch was out of his guests , and they were fairly glad when it was time to go . The most knowledgeable railway buff I met in Simla was a man who , over a period of years , had traveled all over India on trains , visiting racetracks . He seldom stayed overnight . He would hurry to Lucknow on a night train , gamble all day at the track , and then catch the sleeper to Calcutta and do the same thing . I said it seemed a difficult thing to do , all that railroading . No , he said , the difficult thing was putting on a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that no potential thief would guess that he had 5,000 rupees of winnings in his pocket . I GLIDED DOWN from Simla in the cozy little blue train to Kalka and then in the late evening boarded the sleeper for Delhi . It was air-conditioned , and the bed was made ? starched sheets and a soft pillow . There was no better way to Delhi . The next morning I looked out the window and saw the outskirts of the city , simmering under the gray lid of the sky . At Old Delhi station it seemed to me that the unluckiest railwayman in this season of heat was a fireman on a steam locomotive . As I rambled around the station yard , however , I discovered an even more exhausting job : boilermaker . The boilermaker is essentially a welder , but because he must deal with all aspects of the boiler , he is often required to use his welding torch inside the boiler or the firebox . Today it was 103 ? F at the Old Delhi loco shed , but Suresh Baboo , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that he was not deterred by a little thing like heat . He was a railwayman grade two and earned a thousand rupees a @#  |p716  month ( $100 ) , of which four hundred was his " dearness allowance " ( " because in Delhi , food and living are very dear " ) . Was this enough to live on ? Not in Delhi . " We are asking for an increase in the dearness , " said Suresh Baboo . Near New Delhi I found the best organized railway station in India . This was Hazrat Nizamuddin station , just south of the city and a short walk from Humayun 's Tomb . There were flowers and shrubs in pots on the platform , and every day on the orders of the stationmaster , G. L. Suri , ant powder was sprinkled along the walls . Mr. Suri proudly took me on a tour of the station . He had n't been recommended to me by the Railway Board ? I had simply stopped on one of the 180 trains that pass through each day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a station so clean in the hot season ? Mr. Suri said , " I do my duty ? I get satisfaction from it . Sometimes I work 16 hours a day . I do not accept excuses . " He nodded and added softly , " And I am very tough . " IHE Madras-Janata Express passes through Hazrat Nizamuddin station without stopping , which is odd , because " janata " means " people " and the " People 's Express " stops everywhere . It is probably the slowest express in the world . It would be several days before this long rumbling steam train arrived in Madras . It was cheap , but it was not really meant for long-distance passengers ; it went 1,400 miles , stopping at virtually every station ? just like a country bus ? and most people only went a few miles . In India it is easy to tell the long-distance travelers . They are heavily laden and always carry a big steel trunk . At railway stations in India one sees the family grouped around the trunk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a table , and when their train draws in , they hire a skinny man to wrestle it on board . " My mother was typical , " a man told me on this train . " She carried all her jewelry and all her saris ? 30 or 40 of them . She brought glasses to drink out of , cooking utensils , plates , and the trays we call thali . She took the essential household . All Indians do this . The trouble was that my mother used to take all these things even if she was only going away for a day or so . " It seemed that the trunk was an Indian 's best defense against being robbed , contaminated , or stranded : At any moment , using the trunk , an Indian could set up house . " You 're not going far , " I was reminded . No , only to Agra ? six hours on this slow beast ; but six hours was nothing on an Indian train , where some people might say , " When do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tomorrow is .... " I was sitting across from Bansilal Bajaj , one of the great number of Indians who work abroad . Mr. Bajaj was on home leave from Abu Dhabi . Every two years he got malaaaaamilmamea1112M  |p717  two months ' leave , and he spent a month of that on Indian trains , going up and down the country . " In Abu Dhabi all we do is work , " said Mr. Bajaj . " I am in the catering and cleaning business , but I am no more than a machine . When I come back to India , I am human again . " It was a lovely evening , very clear , just after a heavy rainstorm of the monsoon . Now there was not a cloud in the sky , and in the west it was the color of a tropical sea ? greeny blue , reflected in perfectly still pools and paddy fields . There was a sweetness in the air and for a number of miles no people just color and empty space and darting birds .  |p718  Just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled clattering through pitch-blackness , with the steam engine puffing and wheezing and the whistle blowing off-key . Sparks from the smokestack sailed past the window like fireflies . It was almost nine by the time we arrived in Agra . The town is nothing . The Agra Fort is substantial . Akbar 's Mausoleum at nearby Sikandra has character , and the Moti Masjid ( the Pearl Mosque ) has personality ; but the Taj Mahal is something else . Just looking at it , you are certain that you will never forget it . It is not merely a visual experience , but an emotional one ? its pure symmetry imparts such strong feeling ; and it is a spiritual experience , too , for the Taj Mahal is alone among buildings I have seen . It is not merely lovely ; it looks as if it has a soul . 0N THE Ganga-Yamuna Express to Varanasi , it was a long night . There was no bedding , no food , no water ; hot cinders blew in the window ; even first class was filthy . Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very sunny and bright , a noontime heat , though it was hardly half past seven in the morning . All the paddy fields were brim full . The rains were dangerously strong in Hardwar and had flooded Delhi , but here beside the line of the Ganga-Yamuna Express they had guaranteed a great rice crop and had given the landscape a serene lithographed look ? the palms very still , the buffaloes obedient , the Indians up to their shins in water . An emblematic mother carrying her infant weeded vegetables in the middle of another field under the shade of a big black umbrella . For miles , for hours ? for days on these plains ? you see nothing else at this time of year ; men , women , and children planting or  |p720  plowing or tending the crop , and all of them working under the blazing sun and burned as black as their buffaloes . The villages were mud huts and grass roofs , like a glimpse of central Africa in the state of Uttar Pradesh , except that in the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of these villages were signposted , but sometimes a tiny station or a halt displayed the name . We were going the long way to Varanasi , taking the " Faizabad Loop , " via Ayodhya , where monkeys on the platform sat on the inkblots of shade . At Shahganj , rice planters stood scanning the blue sky for clouds . VARANASI STATION has the contours of a Hindu temple , and like a temple it is filled with holy men and pilgrims . It is also full of sacred cows . The cows at Varanasi station are wise o the place ? they get water at the drinking fountains , food near the refreshment stalls , shelter along the platforms , and exercise beside the tracks ; they also know how to use the crossover bridges and climb up and down the steepest stairs . " We are installing cow-catchers , " the station superintendent told me ? but he did not mean the traditional ones , on the engines ; he meant fences to prevent the cows from entering the station . National Geographic , June 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a most holy place to die , or failing that , to be cremated beside the river . Also , Buddha preached his first sermon nearby ; the Jains , too , have their own reasons for revering Varanasi . It is the goal of many pilgrimages . Here the beggars are testing the piety of the pilgrims ; and those small narrow bundles that are being carried through the streets are in fact human corpses , headed for the cremation fires on the ghats . Because nothing that is holy in India can be regarded as dirty , holy Varanasi with its thousand temples is one of the filthiest of Indian cities and positively stinking with sanctity . I met an Indian medical student who had just arrived in Varanasi . He was on his way to the Ganges to take his ritual bath . He said he was definitely planning to bathe in the Ganges , among dead goats and monkeys and the occasional corpse of a beggar who died at the station and was taken to the river and thrown in . " Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " " What about the health aspect ? " He said , " It is a question of mind over matter . " That was not the only contradiction I saw in Varanasi . Nailed to a wall that was smeared with betel juice was the sign SPITTING IN PUBLIC IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH . June 1984 , By Rail Across the Indian Subcontinent P722 From a distance in the early morning Varanasi looks wonderful , and the most glorious sight of it is from the express to Howrah as it crosses the Dufferin Bridge that spans the Ganges just east of the city . From the high vantage point of the bridge , the whole populous riverbank and all the ghats can be seen gilded in the light of the ris'ng sun , and the city 's splendor is intensified because the dist ? Ice hides its decay , and at this time of day ? the early morning ? the river is filled with the pious , washing , swimming , and gem rally going about their prayers . The Howral express , one of India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) rung , just as the passengers from Delhi are yawning and peering out the windows and getting their first glimpses of National Geographic , June 1984 By Rail Across the 1 , P723 the holy city . And the people waiting on the platform at Varanasi are watching the train with admiration , because this train represents luxury ? it has three chair cars , and sleeping cars , and a pantry car , where food is cooked and dished up in trays that are distributed around the train by waiters . The Howrah express is efficiently air-conditioned ; it is famous for being fast , and it is practically always on time . From here ? the outskirts of Varanasi all the way to Calcutta ? the land is waterlogged and fertile , an endless rice field . At noon the train stops at Gaya , near where Buddha received enlightenment . Gaya also marks the beginning of a very strange landscape . Sudden hills are thrust out of the flatness like massive dinosaurs @# P724 petrified on the flat Bihari plain ; and other hills are like pyramids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to belong to any range of hills , and they have a comic plopped-down look . It was wet and cool and jungly four hours later when we entered West Bengal , and when the train stopped , some blind beggars got on . The ticket examiner asked them to beg in a different part of the train , and they meekly agreed . This ticket examiner was a woman ? one of three or four women who work on the train . Her given name was 0llie @#  |p725  Frances . " I was a Christian , " she said . " But then I married Mr. Ningam for love , and so I became a Hindu . It was for the children 's sake ; it would have been too confusing for them otherwise . " Mrs. Ningam had seven children , the eldest eighteen , the youngest five . She missed them when she made this Calcutta run , but her relatives helped look after them . She had worked for the railways for 20 years . What Mrs. Ningam liked best about the Howrah express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Calcutta . As the train drew into Howrah station , the daylight was extinguished by smoke and rain mixed with fog ; frightening numbers of people were making their way through the mud and lamplight.  |p727  Howrah station is very large , but like Calcutta it is in a state of decay . Enormous and noisy , a combination of grandeur and desolation , the wonder is that it still works at all . Calcutta is one of the cities of the world that I associate with bad dreams of the future . This is how New York City could look , I think , after some terrible disaster . The monsoon that beautifies and enriches the countryside made Calcutta ugly and almost uninhabitable . Rain in India gives all buildings , especially modern ones , a look of senility . The streets were flooded , there were stalled cars everywhere , and people waded among the drowned dogs . " Under prevailing conditions , Calcutta 's future is very dark , " Professor Chatterjee told me in Calcutta one afternoon . Professor Chatterjee is an astrologer . He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that I would live to the age of 78 , have another child ( a daughter ) , and be given problems by people of small size . In Calcutta I reflected on my traveling across the subcontinent by train , my going from station to station . The stations had everything ? not only food and retiring rooms and human company , but also each station possessed the unique character of its city , its peculiar stinks and perfumes . I HAD WANTED to take a train to the state of Assam , to Nowgong and Silchar , and then west to Sylhet and deeper into Bangladesh . But this had become impossible . There was fighting in Assam , civil strife between Assamese and Bengalis , and furthermore the Nagas had never been completely pacified . Even Darjeeling is regarded as a sensitive border area ; foreign overland travelers need a special permit to visit Darjeeling , and when the permit is shown at the railway station in New Jalpaiguri , your passport is stamped , just as it would be if you were crossing from one country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a train that is slow ? particularly one that is making a long journey through such remote states . But in one respect the Kamrup Express to New Jalpaiguri was unusual : It had a dining car . For hours after we left , relays of men ? only men ? sat in the dining car squashing rice and dhal ( lentil sauce ) in their fists and flinging it into their mouths . Meanwhile , the kitchen staff boiled caldrons of lentils and crouched between the cars strenuously peeling potatoes . At dawn everything was different and serene . The landscape was dry here , but the trees were green , and not far away were the dim blue shapes of mountains to the north and northwest . We were scheduled to arrive at 7:15 . At 7:30 we stopped at a tiny station near the village of Dhumdanj , which was no more than a few cows and a few families and one buffalo . Two hours passed . This is an aspect of train travel that must not be overlooked : the unexplained stop in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which only a dog barks , and someone shuts off a radio , and a child emerges from the tall grass beside the track to sell tea in disposable clay cups . You do n't know whether you will leave in two minutes or two days , so it is unwise to stray very far from the train . The sun moves higher in the sky . A child begins to weep . Then an unexplained whistle sounds , and a few seconds later the train moves , and five hundred Indians run beside , trying to board . We left Dhumdanj . Everyone calls the train from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling the " toy train . " It is a narrow-gauge mountain railway , with the sort of small blue steam engines that other people put into transport museums ; each is a real jewel , a true original . It was bravely built , and it looks so clever and powerful that it seems an impertinence to do anything to it except ride it and let it run . Throughout the hundred or so years in which it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually looks indestructible . National Geographic , June 1984 By Rail Ac  |p729  On this railway line dogs sleep between the tracks , and children play on the tracks and roll toys along them , and the tracks are also put to practical use by men who push huge logs along them ? skidding them downhill on the rails . The four coaches are nearly always full , if not with legitimate travelers then with joyriders ? the train is part of the life of the long series of mountainsides en route to Darjeeling . Some people only ride a hundred yards , others are going miles . The toy train is full of businessmen , farmers , Buddhist monks , and schoolchildren . Every ticket is made out in duplicate , though none of them costs more than a few cents . The train passes by the houses , a few familiar inches from the windows . A boy reaches out and plucks a flower from the embankment covered with blue hydrangeas , yellow primroses , carnations , and roses , and hands it to a woman in a shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant plains , and so the traveler on the toy train has a view that seems almost unnatural , it is so dramatic . At Sonada it is like standing at the heights of a gigantic outdoor amphitheater and looking down and seeing the plains and the rivers , roads and crops printed upon it and flattened by the yellow heat . There are wisps and whorls of cloud down there too . But up here it is dark green , wet hill country . Nearly everyone has rosy cheeks . AFTER SONADA we came to Jor Bungalow station and then to Ghum , the highest railway station on the subcontinent at 7,407 feet . The mist shifts slightly , and farther along , toward Darjeeling , it is possible on a clear day to see the long irregular ridge of Kanchenjunga , massively white in the great folds of snowcovered rock . The so-called Batasia Loop is the famous descent in which the train appears to be tying itself into a knot while at the same time whistling impatiently to clear its own caboose out of the way . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gliding into Darjeeling , still following the main road and bumping past the shops and sharing the thoroughfare with the Buddhist monks and the bullock carts . Darjeeling , also a famous hill station , is unlike Simla . It is not an Indian resort but rather a Nepalese town . It is a solemn place , full of schools and convents and monasteries . It is barer than Simla , not as populous ; it is muddier , friendlier , rather un-Indian in aspect . Simla has visitors , Darjeeling has residents ; Simla is AngloIndian , but Darjeeling is Oriental . It is not posh . Darjeeling is a hospitable place . The curse of the town is its traffic ? an endless procession of honking jeeps and trucks . It seemed to me that Darjeeling 's traffic problem could be solved with an updated version of the railway , which was completed a hundred years ago . The train was a great solution then , and it still serves the town , for many people commute from places like Ghum to jobs in Darjeeling ? to the shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger occupations in Darjeeling such as the carver of yak bones and the clerk who stands under the sign Licensed Vendor for Ganja &; Bhang . Ten grams of ganja ( marijuana ) ? 30 cents .  |p730  The train badly needs to be improved , but of course the wonder of it ? like the wonder of much else in India ? is that it still operates . India is a complex place . The phones seldom work , the mail is unreliable , the electricity is subject to sudden stoppages . There are numerous natural disasters , and there are 700 million people . It seems almost inconceivable that this country is still viable , and yet there are times when one gets glimpses of its greatness . Near the end of my Indian journey I decided that India runs primarily because of the railway . It is an old-fashioned solution , but India has old-fashioned problems . INDIA 'S relations with Bangladesh could not be described as warm ; perhaps on the theory propounded by Robert Frost that good fences make good neighbors , India has recently announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1,500-mile barbed-wire fence . Passenger trains have not crossed the border for some time . I flew to Dhaka ( Dacca ) and took the Ulka Express east and south toward Chittagong . The Ulka Express , 15 coaches long ? one was first class ? was pulled by a diesel engine . I would have gone second class , but I would not have gotten a seat , and I was not prepared to stand for nine hours . This train was on the world news the day I boarded it : It was the only link between Dhaka and Chittagong . Every other road was under five feet of water , and scores of people had drowned in the torrential rains . But the monsoon comes every year to Bangladesh , and it is always severe . Its damage comes so regularly it is not remarkable . The feeling on the Ulka Express was that Bangladesh was having another unlucky week . It was not immediately obvious that the rain was a disaster . Today the sun was shining , and this whole southern part of Bangladesh had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floodwater . And the only things showing above all that water were the long straight rails of the track . National Geographic , June 1984  |p734  At Tongi junction I saw another train pull in . There were perhaps 50 people clinging to the sides of the engine and hanging from the carriages and sitting and standing on the coach roofs . These seemingly magnetized people had the effect of making the train look small . They completely covered it , and of course the paying passengers were jammed inside . I leaned out the window and saw that , apart from my coach , my whole train was exactly the same ? people everywhere , holding on to the sides , the engine , and crowding the roofs . To the sound of a young beggar boy 's flute , the train rattled south . In this hot , stricken country the only things that moved were the trains . But there was no panic . At Akhaura ( " Change here for Sylhet " ) a man stood up to his waist in a flooded field thoughtfully washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages ? the larger boats were beamy , like old Portuguese frigates , and the National Geographic , June 1984 By Rail Aci  |p735  smaller ones were gracefully shaped , much like Persian slippers . " You will see where President Zia was assassinated in Chittagong , " Mr. Shahid said as we rolled along , as if he were passing on a piece of tourist information . At Comilla I met a young man who had just opened an office to encourage Bangladeshis to enroll in a voluntary sterilization program . " They need incentives . . . . " What sort ? I wondered . " We have tried money and clothes as a sort of reward , but it is not enough . We need something more substantial . There is no problem with middle-class people . I have two children myself , and I think that is a good number . The problem is with the poor . But this is a democratic country , and so we do not make sterilization compulsory . " Was he making any progress ? " Very slow progress , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Comilla , at the town of Feni . With a kind of gloomy resignation some people resolutely bailed out their houses and fields , and others took baths . The children in the area were swimming and diving and having a wonderful time . The floods had also brought fish to these hungry people , and where the banks of rivers had been breached , fishermen were enthusiastically using nets , scoops , lines , buckets , and ancient-looking fish traps . The day continued hot , but the flood did not abate . Just ahead lay Chittagong , simmering under the sun , an unprepossessing @#  |p743  settlement on the estuary of the Karnaphuli River ? docks , moldy buildings , prowling seamen , blackened palm trees , stormdamaged roads . The airport had been closed for three days . It too was underwater . Even the people in Chittagong admit there is very little to see there . They say , " Go to Rangamati " ( known for colorful tribesmen ) , " See Karnaphuli Reservoir " ( a big lake ) , or " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Bay of Bengal ) . I did not make any more plans . For me this was the end of the line .
