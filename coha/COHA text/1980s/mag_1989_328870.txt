First , they confiscated the coffee farms of three opposition members . Then , in Caracas , Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann charged that unnamed U.S. officials were involved " down to the marrow of their bones " in drug trafficking . <P> Washington 's reaction : Any talks with Ortega at this time would be premature .
