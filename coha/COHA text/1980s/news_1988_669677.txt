' ' If we need to confine exotic animals at all , I believe they should be left untrained to enjoy loving , daily interactions with their keepers. ' ' // Many people see Ms. Derby ' s position as extreme . After all , it would mean the end of trained animals in movies , theme parks , and zoos . And when animal training is done in a responsible atmosphere , it is generally seen as a fun-loving , even wholesome activity. // // Nevertheless , she is leading a moral crusade , which , among other activities , has involved her in a state investigation of animal abuse at the San Diego Zoo which probes the fine line between animal discipline and abuse. // Derby ' s strong views come after more than two decades of performing-animal experience : everything from cleaning cages and bottle-feeding newborn tigers to training animals for such TV shows as ' ' Daktari , ' ' ' ' Flipper , ' ' and ' ' Gentle Ben . ' ' She and her husband produced the first Lincoln-Mercury ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also used in Honda , Kal Kan , and Purina ads and appeared in dozens of films , including Walt Disney ' s ' ' The Love Bug , ' ' plus television series such as ' ' The Waltons , ' ' ' ' Gunsmoke , ' ' and ' ' Lassie. ' ' // Four years ago Derby put her philosophy to work on a small ranch in northern California , where she founded PAWS ( the Performing Animal Welfare Society ) , a retirement home for performing animals . It was also turned into a shelter for homeless animals , including a wolf , a coyote , two leopards , and a runt African elephant named ' ' 71 ' ' that couldn ' t keep up with the herd on a Florida millionaire ' s ranch. // Derby talks with each of the 15 animals in a unique , imitative ' ' language , ' ' pausing to let Harriet the baboon groom her through the cage bars , and handing ' ' 71 ' ' a hose so she can spray herself . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacious , clean cages . PAWS is nonprofit and claims nearly 2 , 500 members. // Strangers driving down the country road would never guess that behind the ordinary ranch-style house with a cracked driveway is a miniature zoo . Here , in this peaceable kingdom , Derby plans a strategy for her fight to improve the lives of exotic animals in California. // Right now she ' s optimistic . At the close of the August California legislative session , Democratic state Sen. Dan McCorquodale announced he would form a study group consisting of zoo personnel , federal and state agency officials , and public-interest groups to deal with the question of exotic-animal care. // This question surfaced at the July 29 hearing into the alleged mistreatment of Dunda , an African elephant at the San Diego Zoo ' s Wild Animal Park . Derby , who starred in the public hearing , is heartened by the public outcry and believes the incident has united animal rights supporters. // The hearing revealed that in February , Dunda , an 18-year-old African elephant , was disciplined with beatings by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beatings - more than 100 blows to the head over two days - sparked investigations by the San Diego Zoological Society , the Humane Society of the United States , and the San Diego Humane Society. // Zoo officials decided to move Dunda from the zoo , after 11 years , to the nearby 1 , 800-acre Wild Animal Park because her ' ' highly excitable ' ' and ' ' defensive ' ' personality made her difficult to manage in the zoo . Following the move , Dunda lunged at a keeper with enough force to break a tusk , threatening the safety of her keepers , until Alan Roocroft , the park ' s elephant training supervisor , decided to discipline her ' ' in a manner that would get the most effect and cause Dunda the least harm. ' ' // During the next two days , six trainers short-chained her legs , brought her to a kneeling position , and hit her on the head with hickory sticks ( some reports said keepers used ax handles and elephant hooks ) , shouting , ' ' Dunda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials maintain that beatings are an acceptable form of elephant management and offered no apologies for the incident . Mr. Roocraft defended the session , saying keepers struck the elephant ' s head rather than her limbs to avoid permanent injury and let the animal see who was administering the punishment. // Witnesses at the hearing gave varying views of the severity of the beatings . Roocraft maintained the discipline sessions did only superficial damage to Dunda ' s head and did not break the skin . But veterinary reports from the San Diego Humane Society investigation describe ' ' excessive skin breakage ' ' and conclude ' ' the discipline went too far. ' ' // Jeff Jouett , publicist for the Zoological Society of San Diego , the private corporation operating the zoo and park , says elephants are accustomed to a group hierarchy . ' ' Elephants look to the keeper , asking who ' s in charge . They may challenge the control , but basically they want a leader . ' ' Beating is an appropriate discipline for elephants , he adds , because herd members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much damage can a 180-pound human do to a four-ton animal ? ' ' On the other hand , elephants ' great size endangers trainers , so ' ' keepers must dominate. ' ' // Derby disagrees . ' ' Trainers say that unless you dominate the elephant it will kill you . But it ' s the trainers who make a killer elephant by keeping the animal fearful and dependent. ' ' // The hearing ended without agreement . But after the Dunda incident , the San Diego Zoological Society announced that in the future , Roocraft may recommend elephant discipline but a zoo veterinarian and a curator will make the decision. // Derby ' s appearance at the Dunda hearing angered and disappointed some zoo personnel who remembered when she rode her elephant , Neena , through the ceremonial opening ribbon at the Wild Animal Park in 1972 and later gave talks about her animals to zoo visitors. // ' ' They wanted me to tell of the good times , ' ' Derby says . ' ' But I have to speak about what is happening now. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the category of animal training , ' ' Derby says . ' ' But the San Diego Zoo trains animals for on-site shows and offers animal rides. ' ' // Mr. Jouett says the zoo ' s performing animals ' ' are trained to show their natural behavior . For example , an otter will walk through a tube resembling a hollow log , demonstrating its natural agility , or an owl will fly silently in circles. ' ' // ' ' There ' s no training without some negative reinforcement , ' ' says Derby . ' ' To get an animal to perform on cue requires cruelty . A dog doesn ' t willingly jump through a hoop . A bear doesn ' t want to waltz . ' ' She has not been a sideline spectator in the animal world . ' ' I ' ve personally done everything I ' m criticizing . I ' ve learned by doing wrong things. ' ' // While working for animal trainers in Hollywood , she watched in horror as they electroshocked elephants in the vagina , anus , ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of bears to establish dominance . She began to ask questions : ' ' Do we have the right to hurt an animal that depends on us ? ' ' // Her colleagues told her to get tough or get out . Her marriage to animal trainer Ted Derby ended after a final argument over his insistence on using an electric cattle prod in training. // In 1978 , Derby published ' ' The Lady and her Tiger , ' ' exposing the inside world of performing-animal training . In 1985 , she fought for passage of a California law to improve the regulation and inspection of exotic-animal compounds statewide. // ' ' I ' ve been called anthropomorphic , a bleeding heart , and a victim of the Bambi syndrome for raising questions about animal treatment , but it hasn ' t quieted me , ' ' Derby says in a well-modulated voice. // ' ' Animals can ' t speak for themselves . People have to speak for them. ' ' // //               @ @ @ @ @ @
