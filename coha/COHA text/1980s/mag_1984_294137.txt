A deli ? On Park Avenue ? Ugh ! <P> <P> It sounded like a great idea , at least to Kyu Shung Choi : a 24-hour gourmet food store on Park Avenue , at the center of one of Manhattan 's ritziest residential blocks . Smelly French cheeses , bottled water , fresh vegetables and , near the back , a few of those gooey snack foods people sometimes need really late at night . And get this : there are no other food stores on Park Avenue for blocks . <P> It was not a great idea . Last month Shirley Bernstein took one look at the busy renovations going on across the street from her Park Avenue place and her head spun . A deli ? Not on her block . <P> " Do the residents of Park Avenue want to look out the window at vegetables ? " she asked . " They most certainly do not . " Besides , she went on , " can you imagine the litter ? " Spoiling for a fight , Bernstein mailed off petitions to 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Building inspectors soon arrived in droves , finding code violations on almost every shelf . Choi , no chump , halted his renovation plans , complied with each building ordinance and applied to the city landmarks preservation commission for permission to keep his new awning . Then the underdog syndrome took over . While Choi started getting fan letters , Bernstein got 60 obscene phone calls . A writer from Gourmet magazine called her a snob . Customers like a little cause clbre with then-caviar . Maybe it was n't such a bad idea after all . -
