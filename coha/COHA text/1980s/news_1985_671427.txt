" How ' s it going ? " his friend asked // " He ' s here , too , " Bill Wennington said. // Bill Wennington , of course , was talking about Patrick Ewing , the 7-foot Georgetown center who was on the United States team . And when St. John ' s lost to Georgetown last night , 85-69 , at Madison Square Garden , " he " was here again - the anticipated first choice in the National Basketball Association ' s draft of college talent , the most intimidating center in college basketball , an all-American , an Olympic gold medalist. // In last night ' s dance of the 7-footers , Bill Wennington also was on display as a future N.B.A. center. // More and more , the Canadian-born resident of Wheatley Heights , L.I. , is being listed by N.B.A. scouts as a first-round choice in the May draft . He is being touted as a 7-footer who can run . But because he ' s played against him so often , Bill Wennington understands why Patrick Ewing will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bill Wennington said with a smile before last night ' s game , " have been living together for four years.

He had 8 points and 6 rebounds while controlling Patrick Ewing , who had only 9 points , but 15 rebounds. // " It ' s always a fun challenge to go against Patrick , " the St. John ' s center said . " I really look forward to playing against him. " // // When both were freshmen three years ago , Bill Wennington was overmatched as the Hoyas swept three games from the Redmen that season , by 30 , 17 and 15 points . After the 30-point loss , Bill Wennington ' s father asked him about Patrick Ewing even though the Georgetown center had scored only 9 points and grabbed only 6 rebounds. // " My father asked me , ' Was he really that good ? ' " Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yeah , there really wasn ' t much I could do to stop him . I tried.

When they were juniors , a sprained ankle kept Bill Wennington out of the the first regular-season game ( which the Hoyas won by 22 points ) , but the Redmen won the second before losing to the Hoyas in the semifinals of the Big East tournament. // Somewhat significantly , before last night ' s game , St. John ' s had won four of its previous five games against Georgetown when Bill Wennington was playing. // " But the team has to get the credit for that ; I can ' t give myself the credit , " the St. John ' s center said .

" // // Lou Carnesecca once had another St. // John ' s center , the 6-11 Billy // Paultz , now in his 15th pro season. // " In certain respects , Wennington ' s game is ahead of what Paultz ' s game was like then , " the coach said . " This kid runs much better . Paultz had a great shot , but this kid is a better shot-blocker . And he ' s still learning . Every year he has added something .

But just then Lou Carnesecca happened to emerge from his nearby office . Quickly , the coach put an arm around Bill Wennington and walked him away. // " No , no , " the coach said . " Let ' s not fool around with this stuff , not even with the mask. " // For last night ' s game , Lou Carnesecca ' s instructions to Bill Wennington were quite simple. // " Stay in the game ; don ' t foul out , " the coach said .

" // Before last night ' s game , Bill Wennington was averaging 12 points and 6 rebounds a game - not that much different than Patrick Ewing ' s average of 14. 3 points and 9. 7 rebounds. // " I have a definite role on this team , " the St. John ' s center said . " On defense , my job is to intimidate the guards from coming inside , and to get rebounds . On offense , I ' m supposed to crash the boards and fill in the gaps when Chris and Walter are being double-teamed.

Bill Wennington didn ' t really begin playing basketball until he moved to Long Island from Montreal , where he had been born. // " I didn ' t touch a basketball until I was 11 , " he said , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Few outdoor basketball courts existed in Montreal , and when he moved to Long Island , he didn ' t realize that most American youngsters played basketball outdoors all year round. // " My coach asked me if I ever went to the playgrounds to play basketball , " he recalled . " I didn ' t know what he was talking about. " // But last night Bill Wennington was playing basketball in the Garden against Patrick Ewing , the nemesis of his St. John ' s career . But in another sense , Patrick Ewing ' s reputation has eased the expectations for Bill Wennington , by both the basketball public and himself. // " If I do well , it ' s really good for me , " Bill Wennington said . " And if I do bad , that ' s what Patrick is supposed to do to the other center. " // //
