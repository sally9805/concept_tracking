The U.S. dollar ' s descent against major foreign currencies gathered some force yesterday . But many U.S. and foreign economists believe the decline so far has proceeded smoothly enough to avoid damage to world economies . In the largest single-day drop since the current slide began last Friday , the dollar fell nearly 1% in late New York trading , to 2. 9393 West German marks from 2. 9665 marks Tuesday , while the British pound rose 1% , to $1. 38 from $1. 3670 the day before . The dollar also fell below nine French francs for the first time since last Aug. 31 . The dollar has fallen enough to give American exporters hope for stronger sales growth later this year . But the dollar is still high enough to help foreign economies , which should continue to benefit from healthy sales to the U.S. " At present , it is good news for the world economy . The dollar is coming down quickly but smoothly , " said Paul Ormerod , chief economist at Henley Center for Forecasting in London . Although the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dizzying highs earlier this year , there was concern that it would fall too far too fast . A too-sharp drop , economists warned , would cut off U.S. imports , which have played a major role in the world economic recovery . In addition , a weak dollar , by increasing the price of imports , could rekindle inflation in the U.S. Some worries remain . The dollar has dropped 24% against the pound , 16% against the French franc and 15% against the West German mark since early March . A further decline of 10% to 15% in the dollar ' s value over the next few months wouldn ' t hurt , but economists warn that problems could arise if it falls more than that . " A decline in the dollar from 10 francs to nine was favorable , and a decline from nine to eight would still be favorable . But below eight francs , the net effect would be negative " because it would reduce French exports , says Jacques Plassard , director general of Rexeco , an economic research organization in Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dollar ' s fall since the July Fourth holiday . And traders foresee a further drop in the near future . " I think we ' ll test new lows this week , " says Douglas E. Hart II , an assistant vice president and manager of the corporate advisory desk of Credit Suisse , New York . But few economists expect the dollar to go into a free fall , even though there may be sharp fluctuations . For one thing , while the U.S. economy has slowed , it still is buoyant compared with most of Europe , and the U.S. remains attractive to foreign investors . " To bail out ( of the dollar ) today wouldn ' t make too much sense , " says Karl Van Horn , chairman of American Express Management in London . The dollar ' s decline has a number of beneficial side effects , economists agree . Countries that have kept up interest rates to protect their currencies against a strong dollar may be able to reduce them .

" Over the past eight or 12 weeks , I ' ve detected more cautious commentary on exchange rates or trading problems . " This problem won ' t disappear overnight , however . For one thing , it usually takes a few months before exchange-rate movements are reflected in prices of goods . The dollar has dropped only 7% against the Japanese yen since early March , and the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is expected to widen again in 1985 from last year ' s record $37 billion . Europeans , who have been the harshest critics of the strong dollar , say they are pleased with the rate of the dollar ' s fall so far . Because the dollar hasn ' t dropped too much , economies should continue to enjoy some of the benefits of a strong dollar without suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should remain fairly healthy . " We haven ' t started any survival training courses ( for exporters ) yet , " said an official at the Bundesbank , West Germany ' s central bank . " We can live with the dollar " at the current exchange rate of about 2. 94 marks . Guenter Weinert , at the HWWA economic institute in Hamburg , said that even at 2. 80 marks to the dollar , German industry " would still be good against U.S. competitors . " But an ever-weakening dollar eventually would hurt European exports . Mr. Ormerod , the British economist , says that at $1. 50 to $1. 60 to a pound , " there would be a problem for the U.K. in terms of exporting next year . . . Sterling would be overvalued against the dollar and you could perhaps chalk off the recovery next year . " Even though the current exchange of $1. 38 to the pound is still considered favorable , the share prices of some British companies with extensive sales in the U.S.  --  such as Jaguar PLC and B.A.T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . There are fears that the declining dollar will lower these companies ' overseas earnings , though some , such as Jaguar , have hedged in financial markets to protect against a sharp fall in the dollar . A weaker dollar also should ease inflation in some countries because many commodities are priced in dollars . Britain ' s inflation rate has risen to 7% from 5% last year as the strong dollar increased the price of imported raw materials and forced British officials to raise interest rates to prop up the pound . Earlier this week , the government reported that manufacturers ' materials prices rose at an annual rate of just 2. 2% in June , compared with 9% in January . " We ' re confident of getting ( inflation ) down to the 5% area by the end of the year , " in part because sterling has strengthened , the British treasury official noted . Similarly , France figures that each 10% decline in the dollar will reduce its annual inflation rate by half a percentage point . France ' s inflation rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 6. 7% last year , partly because of the weaker dollar . A decline in the dollar also will improve trade balances " because it lowers the price of imports , notably oil , " Mr. Plassard of Rexeco , said . Although this is true for most European countries , Britain as an oil producer will receive less income than it would have because of the dollar ' s drop . While they are pleased with the dollar ' s decline , economists and government officials outside the U.S. worry about Washington ' s reaction , especially if the unexpected happens and the dollar declines sharply . The inflation rate could increase as import prices go up , and that could lead to higher U.S. interest rates . " We would all find it troublesome if U.S. authorities went into a defensive position , raising interest rates . At a time that the U.S. economy already has lost a lot of steam , that would be a real disadvantage , " the British treasury official said .
