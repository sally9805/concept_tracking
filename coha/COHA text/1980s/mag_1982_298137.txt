As Israel 's patience wears thin , the fighting escalates dangerously <P> It was the Muslim feast day of Id al Fitr , marking the end of the monthlong Ramadan fast . As the first light of day fell over West Beirut , families gathered in the city 's cemeteries to mourn their dead . Some people quietly prayed and read the Koran beside older graves marked by marble slabs and beribboned arbors . Others wept beside the many fresh mounds of dirt , marked only by cinder blocks . Near by lay picks and shovels left by gravediggers the evening before . As a heavyset middle-aged woman dropped leafy sprigs on three fresh graves , she became hysterical and collapsed into the arms of those who rushed to help her . The graves held her husband and two sons . <P> The mourning of Id al Fitr is traditionally followed by the exchange of sweetmeats , and festive family gatherings .

In the first aerial bombardment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week conducted dive-bombing raids against predominantly Muslim West Beirut , where some 6,000 P.L.O . commandos have been sealed off , along with 500,000 residents . The main Israeli targets were P.L.O . Chief Yasser Arafat 's headquarters , located in the Fakhani neighborhood south of the center of the city , and P.L.O . positions near the Burj el Barajneh refugee camp on the outskirts of Beirut 's paralyzed international airport . Some 20 to 30 miles to the east , Israeli air force planes bombed Syrian and Palestinian positions at Baalbek in the Bekaa Valley , as well as Syrian armored positions in the center of the valley . On Saturday , Israel lost its second warplane of the conflict , when a Phantom F-4 jet was hit by a Syrian SA-8 missile over Bekaa . It was the first time that the antiaircraft missile had been used in the Lebanon fighting . The Israelis immediately launched heavy raids against other suspected Syrian missile positions . <P> Israeli military officials insisted that the attacks were retaliatory responses to cease-fire violations by the Syrians and the P.L.O. , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ambush that took the lives of five Israeli soldiers on patrol in the Bekaa Valley on Wednesday . Said a high-ranking official in Tel Aviv 's Defense Ministry : " We are sending a message to the Syrians and to the besieged Palestinians : We will not let the situation develop into a war of attrition . " Meanwhile , Fadel el Dani , 37 , the deputy director of the P.L.O . office in Paris , was assassinated late last week when his car blew up as he was starting it , apparently the result of a bomb . The P.L.O . ' s Paris director , Ibrahim Souss , blamed " Israeli terrorism " for Dani 's death , but the Israeli embassy denied that Israelis had been responsible .
