A California Rate Revolt <P> To the company 's shareholders , the initials PG &E; stand for Pacific Gas &; Electric , the largest U.S. commercial supplier of electricity . But more and more of the California utility 's customers prefer " Piggish , Greedy and Egotistic " instead . In recent months residents from Oregon to the Mexican border have been hit with unimaginably steep jumps in their electric bills . <P> In the Northern California town of Orland , Donna Marley , 40 , a widow , saw her December electric bill of $87 leap to $210 in a month . Neighbors Barney and Verna Cushman were shocked when their December bill of $360 surged to $624 in January . Nor have PG &E; customers been the only ones hit . In San Diego , Verna Murray , a customer of San Diego Gas &; Electric , thought that her $250 per month electricity payments were already excessive ; her December bill exploded to $1,854.26 . <P> The main cause of the run-up has been a series of rate adjustments by the California Public Utilities Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Residents in 21 counties have staged electrical blackouts in protest , and at least 1 million people have signed petitions calling for a statewide rollback in rates . Last week more than 1,000 demonstrators converged in Sacramento for a " California tea party " and demanded that Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr . declare a state of emergency . In Loomis , a crowd gathered in a school auditorium and chanted , ' We 're mad as hell and we 're not going to take it any more . " <P> Rates exploded after the PUC granted PG &E; and San Diego Gas &; Electric increases of $909 million and $166 million , respectively . In January , PG &E; was also allowed to adjust its " tier system , " by which the electrical charges go up as usage increases . As a result , at least 50% of the state 's residents saw their bills double and in some cases triple . <P> The utilities contend that the hikes are necessary to cover the rising costs of fuel , labor and materials . Critics retort that gross mismanagement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1970s to buy oil under long-term contracts at prices far higher than those now prevailing . Conservation has cut electrical consumption , but the companies must still incur tens of millions of dollars in expenses to dispose of oil that they are obligated to buy but do not now need . <P> Responding to public pressure , PUC has ordered PG &E; to roll back $100 million of its January rate increase immediately . Last week Governor Brown asked the commission for a further reduction and ordered an investigation into PG &E's; construction-cost overruns , including its ill-fated Diablo Canyon nuclear facility , whose completion has been delayed by a Nuclear Regulatory Commission probe into its design and safety . <P> California 's lawmakers have also begun to feel the heat . Four major bills have been introduced into the state legislature , including one that would require utilities to pass cost overruns on to stockholders instead of consumers . That may not solve the current squeeze on electricity users , but it should make shareholders more attentive to how well the utilities are run .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
