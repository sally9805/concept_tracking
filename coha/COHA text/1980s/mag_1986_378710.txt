The Soviet proposal for a moratorium on nuclear-weapons testing had sat on the table since July , disdained by the Reagan Administration as a mere propaganda ploy . But with the Kremlin 's self-imposed ( and rather self-serving ) testing freeze due to expire on Jan. 1 , Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev sweetened the offer . If the U.S. agreed to join the Soviets in a testing halt , he wrote President Reagan on Dec. 5 , U.S. inspectors would be welcome in the Soviet Union to resolve questions about cheating . <P> Suddenly , the Administration began listening . In 25 years of jawing over arms control , the supremely suspicious Soviets have steadfastly refused to permit foreigners to poke around their most sensitive military installations . Although Gorbachev 's proposal was deliberately vague , the hint that the Soviets might be willing to lower their guard and allow on-site inspections persuaded Reagan to reconsider his flat refusal to talk about a test ban . Last week the President sent Gorbachev a letter , described by White House aides as " conciliatory , " suggesting that experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In theory , a ban on underground nuclear tests would slow the arms race by making each side less confident that it could rely on new weaponry . It would at least be an important symbolic step . In mid-December , 46 U.S. Senators , including twelve Republicans , wrote Reagan urging him to resume test-ban talks to " demonstrate to the world that both you and Mr. Gorbachev are willing to take concrete steps to further reduce superpower tension . " After years of tortuous arms-control negotiations , a test ban has the popular appeal of a quick and easy fix , harking back to the enduring 1963 treaty to end nuclear tests in the atmosphere , underwater and in space . <P> But President Reagan is not eager to agree to a total test ban , even if verification procedures could be worked out . And any deal would surely meet fierce opposition from the Pentagon . The military , with support from the major weapons-research laboratories , wants to continue experimenting with its modernized nuclear arsenal , particularly technology that might be used to implement the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ground site in Pahute Mesa , Nev. , northwest of Las Vegas , the U.S. exploded a device ( code-named Goldstone ) designed to channel the energy of a nuclear blast into a concentrated , powerful beam of X-rays that could knock out a missile or warhead . Indeed , it may have been the Soviets ' fear of SDI that pushed the Kremlin to show some flexibility on verification , in the hope of winning a ban on future tests of such Star Wars technology . <P> The real significance of the verification issue goes far beyond nuclear testing . Actually , on-site inspection is not essential to a test ban , since seismic devices placed outside the Soviet Union can detect most underground nuclear explosions . The Soviets have even shown a willingness in the past to allow seismic sensors on their soil with direct satellite links to the U.S. Inspections of missile installations are a different matter , however , and have become a major sticking point of arms-control negotiations .                 @ @ @ @
