A back wall of wood , against sky . At center , a rosewood dining room bureau , well made and polished , with silver candlesticks , a pewter bowl , and a Bible lying on it . On the wall , at each side , oil portraits of a grandfather and a grandmother , circa 1840 's . Darkness . Music : an introductory phrase for a folksong , played on a guitar or dulcimer , or perhaps , whistled . This short phrase will be repeated on various entrances throughout the play . Lights up . In two handsome wooden chairs sit Rebecca Tull and Clink Williams , who is courting her . They are both in their early twenties . Pause . The phrase of music ends . CLINK So . REBECCA So . CLINK I seen you watching me work . REBECCA Did you ? CLINK Whilst we was a-raising this house . REBECCA Is that a fact ? CLINK Hit purely is .

This house war n't easy , neither . Hard hard work . We scored these logs off flush , se ' em level on a rock foundation , and chinked ' em in with riverbottom clay . Four rooms , a loft , moved in yore fine Virginia furniture , silver goblets , and painted pictures of Momma 's Momma and Daddy 's Daddy on the wall . And whilst yore Daddy was gitting his house built , you was twelve places at once , man looking . And you looked at me a tad more'n tothers , and you plain let me know it . REBECCA You 've a right to your opinion , however loony it may be . I 've heard it and that 's all I have to do about it . CLINK One man after another 's what you was a-doing , speculating on us all and looking hard . Back muscles , front muscles , sweat and swearing , hands and fists and legs , tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lady , all of us , all of that . You are plain ready to marry agin , and let me say it , the man fer you is me . I tolerate a woman 's carnal nature . You let a man know about it . I know what to do about it . REBECCA Lord God four or five times . You strong men hereabouts , you jest do n't mince words , do you ? CLINK Honey , if the shoe fits , wear the damn thing . When you looked at me , raising up and laying in at log wall yonder , thangs were happening . p. 4 REBECCA What a muscle-headed man like you sees happening , and what is truly a-going on , can be a great big two-piece sod-busted difference . I got no need to marry a man whose preference is forever at the front of his pants . CLINK And I got about as much use fer a blueblooded Virginia sweetheart as a pig fer a Bible . But you 've come to live on Sand Mountain , your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horseshoe in a forge , and you 'll marry again . Any woman looks at a man the way you 've looked at me , got to marry or bust . REBECCA That may be , and a body can bust all right , but they 're other men in the world to bust over than you ! CLINK You ai n't been here long enough to sort us all out , Honey Bunch . Rub yoreself agin some other legs here , b'grannies , you 'll commence thinking better about me . REBECCA I doubt it . CLINK I do n't . ( He gets up . ) Ponder this . I am the only growed up young man on this mountain who ai n't never married . You may be a high-born , well-off widderwoman with a famour preacher fer a Daddy but you 're twenty years old . Men here commence low-rating wives the day after they hit fourteen .

SLATE None of us hyar plays Virginia reels , Sweet Potato . No man hyar 's got the time fer sech stammering and stuttering around . You looked at me enough , and more than enough . My first wife died of pneumony , my second of distemper , but I am still feisty and will consider you . I speak plainly . You know what I want , outside right now or next week when we 're married , either one . How about it ? p. 6 REBECCA ( Smiles . ) What can a woman say , when a man puts it to her like that ? SLATE She can say yes . REBECCA How kin I ever resist ? Fine figure of a good honest man , sneaking in when you know my Momma 's a-visiting and my Daddy 's in church , doing me the honor to figure I got nothing better to consider than throwing my life away on some blackslope cowpath , with a split-britches-hasty , shaller-headed fool twenty years oldern me ! Then expecting me to wait around like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pause . ) SLATE You ai n't a-coming outside , are ye ? REBECCA You have finally and at last said one thing that 's true . Pore young widder , what choice does she have ? The ugliness of him , or nothing . Well , so be it . Before I give over my days on earth to a clod-faced , bark-faced , slit-eyed roughneck like you , I 'll live alone ever last day of my creation ! SLATE ( Quietly . ) No , you wo n't . REBECCA I will , too ! SLATE You ca n't . REBECCA Meaning whut ? SLATE Meaning that here on these slopes the nights are cold and blood gets hot . Spit out all them stinging words you 've a mind to now . Come three or four hard winters on Sand Mountain , you 'll take the man will have you , take him fast and gladly . There 's worse than me. p. 7 REBECCA I do n't believe it ! SLATE Hm . Old boy I know , name of Ollen . Took him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jest like you . She did n't come to care for him , and after awhile , she told him so . He put her through a little school of his own . She do n't talk to nobody now . She tends his younguns , and his  --  REBECCA HIS younguns ? SLATE And HIS meals , and HIS clothes , and HIS house and HIS yard and everythang else that 's HIS , afore she even commences pondering arythang that 's HERS . It will happen to you , you keep on talking and strutting . REBECCA I 'll die first . SLATE That could be . I wo n't lie about it . There 's another old boy around here , named Skeets . He shot his wife . And the next day her brothers come and shot him , and their six chillun and his grandaddy too . That 's the kind of real trouble flighty women git everybody into around here , when they do n't know what they 're talking about . Watch what you say to men . They live powerful lonely here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanness . You do n't know what you 're a-fooling with , in this country . ( He gets up . ) What you need ai n't flowers or lace . You need a man who knows the life we live and kin be hard but fair and old as he may be , keep you safe . And I might never hit ye atall . Might never have to , once the flirting is over , and you lie down and like it . Ponder what I 've told ye . I 'll be back . ( Exit Slate Foley . The phrase of music again . Enter Radley Nollins .

RADLEY A bull goose gits ramptious . Fractious . Not ever man rides a woman that hard , though some , telling the Lord 's flat truth , get that way . They do n't have no reliable guide . They burn and then marry , marry and then burn . I am protected agin sech fritter-minded misery . REBECCA By what ? RADLEY By that there . ( He goes to the bureau , holds up its Btble . ) " And from the rib , which the Lord God had taken from man , made He a woman , and brought her unto the man . " Genesis Chapter Two , Verse Two .

That is a great heavy hunk of last month 's lard is what that is , and in her bones , Radley , a woman knows it , and you know it and I know it . Favour is good , Radley , and beauty is jest plain sun-ball wonderful , and the woman what goes about eternally afearing the Lord is scared of her own husband and I ai n't going to live thataway , so go home ! ( Pause . Radley gets up . ) RADLEY Then why play the pore soulful widderwoman hyar ? Not jest to me , neither , but to any man come near you , and you not so picky and choosy you do n't bat eyes at all of ' em ! Amen !
