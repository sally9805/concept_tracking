Last week ' s stock market surge and collapse did little to help investors determine the market ' s direction in the new year . But as investors tried to sort out a volatile first week , capped by a 140. 58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday , a number of traders and analysts say they are bullish on at least one front  --  takeovers of U.S. companies by overseas concerns . " I think this is going to be a very , very major factor in the American stock market this year , " contends Michael Metz , market strategist at Oppenheimer &; Co . , New York . " It will be the major bullish influence on the U.S. stock market . " Two factors are joining to create unprecedented opportunities , experts say . The stock market ' s roughly 30% drop since August , coupled with the dollar ' s relentless slide has , by some measures , made U.S. companies more than 50% cheaper for foreign buyers than they were last summer . " The cheapest place for a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New York Stock Exchange , " says Peter Canelo , investment strategist at Bear Stearns , New York . " That will lead to a lot of takeover activity in U.S. capital goods and basic services . " But dissenters contend that foreign activity can ' t be counted on to support stock prices . " These are isolated stock purchases , " says Scott M. Black , president of Delphi Management , Boston . " I don ' t think they have a major impact on the stock market as a whole . " The topic came to the fore last week after Hoffmann-La Roche launched a $4. 2 billion bid for Sterling Drug . Aside from a huge jump in Sterling ' s share price , many other drug stocks surged on the news . Mr. Black contends that the largest price moves were limited to the companies with the lowest price-earnings ratios , often considered the ripest takeover candidates . " That ' s not investing , that ' s speculation , " he says . Nevertheless , takeover bids from either foreign or domestic suitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor of Standard &; Poor ' s Outlook , explains , " It creates this excitement , this speculative element that ' s attractive to traders , to arbitragers , and is generally a net bullish factor for the market . " Market experts note that takeovers  --  and those by foreign concerns in particular , because they usually are cash transactions  --  create a ripple effect . For example , if the Swiss company succeeds in acquiring Sterling , it would heap $4. 2 billion of new cash on the marketplace . " You have more money in the system that either has to go into bonds , to Las Vegas or into stocks , " Mr. Metz says . That often helps drive the prices of other stocks higher . Moreover , the supply-and-demand equation has been greatly altered in the past several years by the steady removal of shares from U.S. markets . In the past four years , the net stock supply has dwindled an estimated $250 billion , mostly through buy-outs and buy-backs , according to Salomon Brothers Inc . Therefore , the theory goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase . A driving force in a variety of industries , Oppenheimer ' s Mr. Metz and others argue , is that foreign concerns have limited markets in their home regions and are lured by the enormous U.S. market for their products . " The reinvestment opportunities in Europe and Japan are not that wonderful , " he says . " Here you have the biggest markets around and you have the most permissive attitude about allowing people to do takeovers . " Robert W. Willard , head of mergers and acquisitions at Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , says that based on his " backlog and the number of companies we ' re working with , I would say that the majority of major European companies are going to be looking . They might not act but they ' ll be looking . They owe it to themselves to look at the U.S. marketplace . " Mr. Willard says he expects the larger European companies that already have a U.S. presence , such as Unilever and Nestle , to lead the charge . " They ' ve done U.S. acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . Bear Stearns ' s Mr. Canelo adds that the firm ' s offices in Switzerland , Paris and Amsterdam " see corporations ready to buy . . . . They ' ve been waiting for the dollar to bottom . " Most of those companies are seeking acquisitions in the capital goods and chemicals industries , he says . Mr. Metz says he expects 20% to 40% of the total merger and acquisition market to come from such deals . He targets the oil industry , household products ( including Gillette and Colgate-Palmolive ) and forest products and paper companies as particularly vulnerable . Several traders said that although they expect foreign takeover activity to increase , they question whether it will help drive the overall market . The improved financial health of U.S. companies " would draw in more foreign investments and I think that ' s healthy , " says Donald Crooks , an equity trader at Morgan Stanley , New York . " But I don ' t think it portends the market taking off on a bullish spree . " Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market is overvalued and that the bullish experts are using foreign takeovers " as just another theme . Frankly I think the market ' s still overpriced and the sell side of Wall Street is just grasping at straws , " he says . And many experts disagree on which factors would keep the foreigners coming . Mr. Metz , who is bullish on the stock market and thinks the dollar is cheap , says the window of opportunity will close after stock prices and the dollar rise later this year . He also worries about what he sees as renewed protectionist sentiment in Congress . S &; Mr. Kaufman sees the stock market swinging widely before ending the year with little overall change , and the dollar slipping 5% to 10%.
