How-to books are booming as laymen seek to bypass lawyers <P> " I thank you , my mother thanks you , I and my girlfriend thanks you . " So wrote a satisfied reader of How to Do Your Own Divorce in California to the book 's publisher , Nolo Press . The happily divorced man is one of millions of Americans who have found that a likely place to seek solutions to their legal problems is often the neighborhood bookstore . Self-help manuals are proliferating , usually in paperback , and cover every subject from small-claims court to homosexual rights . Nolo , with 20 titles in print , expects to gross $750,000 this year , up $500,000 from 1978 . An estimated 50 other publishers throng the field , ranging from giant , Canada-based International Self-Counsel Press ( 100 titles for a $1 million annual gross ) to underground-style newsletters with circulations of less than a thousand . There is scant mystery about the forces underlying this boom . " People just do n't know what their rights are , " says American Bar Association Spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attorneys because they have no idea what they 're getting into . " Looking at it another way , people have all too good an idea of what they are getting into : a financial minefield . With an attorney 's time now commanding $40 to $150 an hour , potential clients often fear , correctly , that fees will outrun any gain they might hope for by taking legal action . At $5 to $10 a copy , a how-to guide strikes many as the wiser investment . Other factors in the books ' popularity : the post-Watergate tarnishing of lawyers ' credibility and a general desire by people to take a greater role in matters that affect them intimately . <P> <P> Nolo was founded in 1971 in a brown shingled house in Berkeley . Two Berkeley Law School graduates , Ralph Warner and Charles Sherman , emotionally and financially drained after three years as poverty lawyers , teamed up on a manual designed to take advantage of California 's simplified divorce procedures . The result was How to Do Your Own Divorce in California , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $80 million in legal fees . Another big seller is California Tenants ' Handbook ( 85,000 copies ) , which drew this letter from a disgruntled landlord : " I have just read your fascinating book and have put my wife 's and my duplexes up for sale . We ca n't survive with all those lawsuits you promote . " The guides have produced relatively few suits ; most readers use them as an aid to routine , non-courtroom procedures . <P> With prosperity , Nolo has moved to larger quarters in a converted clock factory but retains its raffish , blue-jeans style . The staff , which works amid cantaloupe-crate bookshelves and suspended Chinese kites , has expanded to 17 ( including an artist-lawyer , an anthropologist , and the stand-in for Toshiro Mifune in the TV series Shogun ) . To keep pace with changing laws , they regularly issue updated editions , and recently published a sort of Whole Earth Catalog of the law called The People 's Law Review .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
