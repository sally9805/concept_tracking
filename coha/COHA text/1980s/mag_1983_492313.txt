y ' II confess there are things I 'm A better at than wrapping gifts . I ca n't think of one right off the bat , but there must be . Ribbons and bows and wrapping paper , not to mention my wife ( although I probably will ) , have always conspired against me . No matter how hard I work at trying to prettify a gift , it usually gives the appearance of something that the rural mail carrier has tossed from his car without slowing down . However , before we get to what will no doubt go down in our family chronicles as " the Christmas that father tried to gift-wrap the toboggan , " I would like to register a word or two in my own defense . In the first place , I 'm not like a friend of mine who gave his wife a full set of curtain rods on their seventh ( or , as he had convinced her , enameled-metalware ) anniversary . Not only were the rods a practical gift , but he had what it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bows and wrapping paper for him . Knowing he would be called upon to do it anyway , he simply installed the rods , then called his wife and proudly presented the package complete , parts and installation . Instead of an expensive store-bought card that never says quite what you want to say , he had scribbled this on the back of a telephone-bill envelope : You 've loved me , dear , Through thicks and thins , So here 's some rods For your curtins . I ca n't be that cold-blooded . ( Nor would I have the nerve to try rhyming " thins " with " curtains . " ) If it 's no more than a free ballpoint pen from the Owen County Bank that I 'm presenting to my dear wife , I 've got to gift-wrap the thing and stick on a bow . And for some reason it always comes out looking like a freeballpoint pen from the Owen County Bank that I 've tried to wrap and stick a bow on . One reason my efforts end up looking like something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a flair for this sort of thing . Where I operate on the theory that a gift is presentable if none of it sticks out beyond the paper , she could gift-wrap a live octopus and make it look as if it had come from the Saks Fifth Avenue gift-wrapping service . Every tentacle would be evenly spaced , with perky little red bows sitting jauntily at the ends . That 's another thing . After using up the store-bought bows , she can take a roll of ribbon and a pair of shears and turn out bows like toothpicks from a redwood sawmill . I , on the other hand , can dedicate a half hour to the task , and my bow comes out looking more like a string necktie . To give it more body , 1 try looping it around and tying it again . By that time , it begins to look more like two string neckties tied together . By painstakingly cutting off the ends , I finally get it to look like two string neckties that have had their ends cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perk it up . Neither does giving it a shot of spray starch . I 've tried both . After years of watching my wife 's exhibitions , I 'm convinced that those of the female persuasion are somehow able to extend their index fingers a full two inches . Otherwise they would n't be able to secure the first tie of the knot while drawing the second knot tight . As for me , I end up with enough slack to string the gift on a 2x4 . While facilitating the opening of the package , this also tends to cause it to open before its time . I 'm trying to train the dog to hold his paw on the first knot , but it 's slow going . My shortcoming is further shortened by the lack of a long , flat , uncluttered surface upon which to operate . Lois , of course , has the long , flat , uncluttered surface of the kitchen table for her operations while I 'm away earning the money to buy gifts in the first place . But due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shared by Beau and Verge ( our dog and cat , respectively ; the cat being so named because he was on the verge of being used as one of our gifts the day he inherited us ) . Here , I am allowed to maintain a desk and a few books in one corner . And here it is that I go with my cardboard box of material : giftwrapping paper ( at least once removed ; some of it goes back to 1979 ) , ribbon , shears , Band-Aids ? , glue , stickers , paper clips and dental floss ( from the year I ran out of ribbon wrapping the love seat ) . Now I am faced with the option of clearing the debris on my desk or taking to the floor . One look at my desk and I take to the floor . Which has its disadvantages . Christmas before last , I discovered too late that I was using two-way tape , the kind that sticks on both sides . And by the time I had Lois ' bowling ball completely concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the far corners of the carpet . And if you 've ever tried shaving a bowling ball at 2:00 a.m. , you know it 's no fun . Well , you may ask , why do n't you just take over the long , flat , uncluttered surface of the kitchen table after Lois has gone to bed ? Because , I answer , last Christmas I tried that . And I was going great guns until she got up to see why I was n't coming to bed . And I had toditch the goldfish bowl I was wrapping . And the water ran onto the living room rug . And by the time I had talked her back into bed and retrieved the bowl , Verge had eaten the goldfish . In light of my less-than-distinguished background in gift wrapping , there may be those who will ask why that man would try to wrap a toboggan in the first place Actually , it was n't in the first place , it was in the second place . In the first place , I had tried to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift-wrapping service in an equally posh shopping center , where Lois had taken me shopping and where I had bought the sucker . ( I had always wanted a toboggan . And giving one to Lois for Christmas would kill two birds with one stone ; three , actually , since I would also be getting even for the dish-washer she gave me for Father 's Day . ) Because Lois personally wraps her gifts , I somehow thought all women did . But when 1 joined the line , about 20th from the counter , I was the only man . And the only one holding a toboggan , from what I could see , which was n't much with that thing in my arms . The other 19 had gone more for towels , books , Scrabble ? games , pen and pencil sets , tennis balls  --  stuff like that . The dowager directly in front of me held not only a rubber fire hydrant , but also a gussied-up white poodle that took a sudden liking to my after-shave lotion . And each time the lousy mutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and stare at me as if I were poisoning the miserable little beast . Finally , in an attempt to put our relationship on a chummier basis , I said , " I 'll bet the little feller has been begging for one of those since he was big enough to stand on three legs . " She stared even harder . Thus we were not on the best of terms when 1 began to tilt . I prefer to think it was because of the heat and humidity rather than the bracer I always take to fortify myself against the rigors of Christmas shopping . Or perhaps , if Freud had been standing behind me , he would have said I subconsciously wanted to wrap my hands around the neck of that slobbering canine . Whatever , I felt myself beginning to teeter . And if you 've ever begun to teeter while holding a toboggan in your arms , you know there are only two things you can do : pitch forward or pitch backwards . Luckily , I fell against this dowager and her face-licking mongrel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , restricted somewhat by her full-length fur coat , sent those ahead of her pitching forward like a row of dominoes . I hung around only long enough to see the one at the head of the line sprawl unladylike across the counter , then relinquished my place in line to a fellow male who was carrying a clutch of L'eggs ? pantyhose . Lugging the toboggan back to the sports department , I asked them to hold it for a few minutes . I dragged Lois out to the car and told her to close her eyes " while I go back for continued on page 73 // continued from page 73 sheets . When I had a chain as long as the toboggan , I eased that overgrown sled upon them . So far so good . Trying to bring the edges of the sections together and hold them while applying the tape  --  not so good . For one thing , reading from left to right ( or from north to south , if that would make it clearer ) , they missed coming together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This meant cutting strips from the remaining pieces and running them down the opening . These I held in place with my left leg , which began cramping on me whenever I tried to get the tape under it  --  sticky side down , as much as possible  --  and across both edges of the paper and the center strip . continued on following page 96 Only another bumbler will appreciate my satisfaction in finally raising up , if on only one leg , and finding no part of the gift showing to give it away . The shape , I convinced myself , could easily be mistaken for an ironing board , two bed sheets and matching pillows . As I climbed wearily into bed , Lois asked , " Did you put the cat out ? " " No I did n't , " I said , " I thought you had . The last time I saw him he was . . . " The reason my sentence hung in the air like that was that the last time I had seen Verge he was helping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dental floss , which I was using after running out of ribbon . So I went in and stuck my finger through one of the several small openings around that curved part , and yep , you guessed it . That is why , on Christmas morning , with the family gathered , I brought out the unwrapped toboggan , slid it across my dear wife 's knees and handed her the sentiment I had printed on the back of a coupon good for a 25c discount on our next box of Tender Vittles ? : Together we 've soared to the mountain top , Together we 've gone through the mill , But here , I say , Is the only way , Together we 'll go downhill . Merry Christmas . ' A
