On a hot September afternoon , the members of the French women 's ski team could be found relaxing at a water park near Nice . The team had gathered for a week of training in the south of France , a venue that will never be mistaken for , say , Parris Island . Malgorzata Tlalka Mogore , a slalom racer , wants it understood , however , that the team has been training seriously . " We worked out hard in the morning , for two hours . " says Malgorzata . " It is not all fun and games . " // This also accurately describes the recent tumultuous past for Malgorzata and her twin sister , Dorota , another slalom specialist . In 1985 they decided to leave their native Poland because they felt outdated training methods had arrested their skiing development . Today they , with Super G specialist Catherine Quittet and slalom specialist Patricia Chauvet , are France 's best hopes for a skiing medal in Calgary . // It has n't been easy for the 24-year-old sisters . They have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new language and a new life that includes marriages to French brothers . Dorota married for love , Malgorzata out of expediency . They also had to battle their way back in the Fdration Internationale de Ski 's rankings after being penalized for changing national federations . Having plummeted to 57th and 65th place in the slalom , Dorota and Malgorzata stand 16th and 13th , respectively , rankings that reflect the parallel development of their careers ; you will discover that these twins are nothing if not twinlike . And they are still dealing with the angst of leaving their family and their friends and with their memories of a happy childhood in Poland . // " I 'm not sure either of us could have done it without the other . " says Dorota . In truth , the twins do n't know what one could do without the other , for the longest they 've ever been separated  --  womb to slopes  --  is three weeks . Even now , Malgorzata ( Margot to her French teammates ) shares a house with Dorota and her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six miles from Grenoble . ( Margot 's husband , Christophe , lives in Grenoble . ) The twins ' relationship is like that of a husband and wife who go to the office together : yet  --  do n't forget  --  they are also competitors . One wonders if they ever tire of each other . // Margot looks at her sister and chucks her under the chin . " Not yet . " she says , smiling . // The Tlalka ( tlow-ka ) sisters were born into an athletic family on April 27 , 1963 , Dorota five minutes earlier than Margot . Their father , Jan , won 16 Polish speed skating championships , while their mother , Wlada , was an excellent cross-country skier . The twins grew up in the town of Zakopane , in the Tatra Mountains of southern Poland . The Tlalka sisters learned to skate and ski while very young . " Born on skis , die on skis . " says Margot . When they were 12 , they abandoned their father 's sport to concentrate on the slopes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have never been great champions , " says Margot . " So you do not feel pressure . When my sister and I started to do well , there was  --  how should I say it ?  --  a great explosion of happiness from the people . " She confers with Dorota in Polish . " And when we did n't have a good race , when we lost , it was not a great national deception . " Disaster ? " Yes , disaster , that is it . " // The Tlalkas first slalomed onto the international scene in a World Cup race in Austria in 1981 when , after one run , Dorota stood first and Margot third . On the second run , they went off the course at the same point , which might be expected of twins . While preparing for the 1982 world championships ( where Dorota surprised everyone with a fourth-place finish ) , they were interviewed by Christian Mogore , the ski reporter from Le Dauphin Libr , one of France 's largest newspapers . Dorota and Christian 's meeting ignited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twins had a more pressing concern : how to resuscitate their careers . " We were standing still , " says Dorota . " We wanted something different in our training techniques . We tried to discuss it with our trainer , but he did n't want to hear about it . " // The trainer , Andrzej Kozak , according to others besides the twins , is not a man of compromise . " He is a member of the Party and he built a political atmosphere around everything , " says Margot . " He began to mix up skiing and politics . He wanted to control us. " // Some factors Kozak could do nothing about . The twins wanted year-round training ; Poland has no glacier . The twins wanted better equipment ; Poland has only one factory that manufactures ski equipment . " And we had no  --  how would you call it ?  --  sparring partners except each other , " says Dorota. // So they started looking around . The United States was too far . France seemed logical because Dorota , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study in France , practice with the French team and still ski for Poland . " says Margot . But then Christian and Dorota decided to marry . It was definitely , as they call it , " a love marriage . " but the couple admits that the prospect of expediting Dorota 's French citizenship through marriage hastened the decision . Meanwhile , Christian 's youngest brother . Christophe , a national-caliber bicycle racer whose career was cut short by back trouble , studied the situation from a pragmatic perspective . " Why do n't I marry Malgorzata ? " he said , trying to be helpful . Why not , indeed ? // In June 1985 the twins left Poland with their father , ostensibly for a vacation . Jan returned to Zakopane , but his daughters did n't . On Oct. 12 , 1985 , they were married to the Mogore brothers in a double ceremony in Grenoble , and the twins became French citizens in June 1986. // Franois Sedan , a coach for the French team , studies Dorota and Margot as they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout at Louis II Stadium in Monte Carlo . " The twins are well-liked and respected on the team , " says Sedan , " but they have , now , what you would call a very independent life-style within the team . That is partly because they are so dependent on each other . It is not a bad thing , however . It is shown by Margot 's training , mostly . Margot tries to do too much . Some others you have to push , but Margot you must push to stop . And . sometimes , late in the season , she is tired . " // Margot acknowledges the criticism . " I have had some back pain , and maybe it 's from the extra tennis and volleyball . " She smiles . " Then again , maybe it is my age . " // The differences between the twins are exemplified by Margot 's propensity to overtrain . She is intense , while Dorota is easygoing . Margot tends to brood , where Dorota practically bubbles ; searching for the French words to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very open . " // Margot looks more like an athlete in training . too . Christian remembers that the twins were " almost impossible to tell apart " five years ago . but they are easily distinguished now . Margot is not overweight by any means , but she is at least seven pounds heavier than Dorota . It is Margot who has established herself in the grueling giant slalom  --  she finished seventh last February at the world championships and considers herself a serious contender for an Olympic medal  --  though Dorota had good GS results last December . " Margot skis harder , more aggressively . " says Sedan , " whereas Dorota depends on finesse . She has a very fine touch on the turns . " // The twins do not necessarily agree that their styles are different  --  " If I watch a video , I can not always be sure if it is my sister or me , " says Dorota  --  but they do admit to personal differences . " I think maybe I 'm a little cooler , a little calmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not take so seriously the troubles of the course . I think my sister is a little more nervous and ... "  --  she stops to question Margot in Polish  --  " yes , a little more analytical . // " In life it 's like that , too . Say I want to buy a dress and it 's really too much money , but , oh , I like it so I buy it . My sister can see the same dress and say , ' Oh , I do n't know . Where will I wear it ? Do I need it really ? Do  --  ' " // " Do I have the shoes to go with it ? " cuts in Margot . " Do I have a bag to go with it ? Does it .... " // You get the idea . But one should not dwell on their differences , lest they become exaggerated into stereotypes . Their differences are more of degree than type , and they so obviously complement each other that it seems as if they sat down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll take that . " They are a mix of parts " is the way Christian puts it . Dorota , for example , is at the point on public relations matters and is much more arrangement-minded . " If there is a phone call for the twins , " says Christian , " my wife is always , always , always the one who returns it . " But Margot tends to hold the reins on matters relating strictly to skiing . She usually speaks for both at official press conferences and does most of the technical schmoozing with the coaches . // " We 've always been together , " says Margot , " doing the same things , going to the same places . So maybe it is natural we work together so well , and that we have the same view of so many things . " // Perhaps . But the twins seem preternaturally close , given the pressures they face both in private and on the slope . Their respective marital situations , for example , could be a breeding ground for trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about her arranged marriage to Christophe , but neither is she ashamed of it . She and her husband are good friends and , fortunately for the harmony of the household in Uriage , she and Christian are extremely close , too . " I think of myself not only as the husband of Dorota , " says Christian , " but also the brother of Malgorzata. " // The twins miss their parents desperately , so desperately that it is hard for them to talk about it . They have seen them only a few times since leaving Poland , but they have not been back to their native country . There is no legal reason they can not travel freely to and from Poland , but they have decided that it would be better to let some time pass before they do . Chances are , they will return in the spring or summer . // Their feelings about Poland are complicated and , refreshingly , not identical . Dorota seems much more certain than her sister that her future lies in France . // " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know my name , it would be nice , but then what would I be ? " says Dorota . " Only a ski trainer . In France , there seems to be more of a chance to develop yourself . " // Margot is not so sure . " I think of myself as a Pole . " she says . " Maybe in 20 years it will be different , but that 's how it is right now . // " You know , in Poland there were moments when it was not nice to be there , like during the time of martial law . It was not quite so dramatic in Zakopane as in other , more working-class cities , but you could feel it . The soldiers , the policemen . Dorota and I had been in the West competing , shopping , smiling , out doing things , and when we came home , we could see that our people were anxious and distressed . Poland is not going to look very good with that comparison . " // She pauses and smiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I think of Poland , I think of our childhood , our parents , only pleasurable things . The Poles have a strange mind , you see . In every world-famous person they try to find the Polish blood . And usually they succeed . They are proud of their people , and I know they would be proud of Dorota and me . It would give me great satisfaction to win a medal , for myself , for France , for Poland . " // The twins are not favorites to finish in the top three in Calgary , but neither are they long shots . They have a chance . Which raises an interesting question : How would one twin react if only her sister won a medal ? // Dorota squirmed in her seat and thought about it for a moment . Then she looked her sister squarely in the eye and smiled . " I would be unbelievably happy , " she said , " but I would prefer it would be me . " Margot smiled and nodded . " I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
