With an eye to 1984 , O'Neill scotches a compromise bill <P> The real news came almost as an afterthought . House Speaker Tip O'Neill was winding down a routine press conference last week when he offhandedly announced that he would block a sweeping reform of the immigration laws from even reaching a vote . " The His-panics , " O'Neill declared , " have said that it 's the worst thing that has ever confronted them . " <P> Thus , without even consulting other Democratic leaders in the House , O'Neill derailed a compromise bill that was designed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants , while giving amnesty to most of those already here . Co-sponsored by Republican Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Democratic Congressman Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky , the legislation was the product of seven years of work by a national commission , a presidential task force and half a dozen congressional committees . The need for reform was clear enough : more than a million-illegals pour over U.S. borders every year . <P> But for the intensely partisan Speaker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned him that its passage would cost the Democrats Hispanic votes in 1984 . The Speaker was determined to keep this important bloc happy . Democrats " truly represent the Hispanics of America , " he said . " These are the people my party is trying to help . " <P> At the same time , O'Neill tried to blame the Administration for undermining the bill . The White House wanted the Democratic-controlled House to pass it , he asserted , so the President could veto it . That way , Reagan would come across as a hero to Hispanic Americans , and the Democrats as chumps . Was the man in the Oval Office capable of such a cynical trick ? " He 's the most political man I 've seen there , " snapped O'Neill . <P> The notion of a G.O.P. double --  cross was first planted in O'Neill 's ear by California Congressman Edward Roybal , one of the eleven-member Hispanic caucus . Roybal admits that he first heard it as dinner gossip , but as evidence , he produced a letter from Attorney General William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the House version of the bill . Rumors supposedly emanating from the White House also hinted of a presidential veto . <P> The Administration stoutly denied it . " I 'm not trying to set Tip up , " Reagan protested to Republican congressional leaders . " We want the immigration bill . " Vice President Bush personally delivered the same message to the Speaker . The letter from Smith was described as nothing more than a routine working paper , in effect a bargaining stance for haggling over the bill 's particulars . Said the Attorney General : " This in no way amounts to a veto threat . " As for the rumors from the White House , they came from a lowly and uninformed aide in the office of Faith Whittlesey , assistant to the President for public liaison .
