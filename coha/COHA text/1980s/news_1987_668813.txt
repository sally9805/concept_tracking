My frequently expressed view of Robert C. " Bud " McFarlane has been that of a man out of his depth as national security adviser , bitterly disappointed at never receiving the respect and acclaim accorded to a Kissinger or Brzezinski , who was straining to match the strategic achievement of a China opening or a Camp David agreement with his own reaching out to " moderates " in Iran . Bud ' s lawyer , Leonard Garment , is a friend of mine from the Nixon years . He told me I was harsh in my estimate of the man and his motives , and pointed to Bud ' s willingness to brave testimony under oath before Congress and a special prosecutor , unlike other key National Security Council military colleagues . I suggested an interview . On Jan. 22 , as snow fell in Washington , Bud McFarlane showed up at the Washington bureau of the New York Times , a block from his office , when I was in New York . My assistant found him politely glum . He left a note , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try to resolve our misunderstandings . We met a week or so later for the first of what I hope will be a series of talks in his office at the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies . A few days later he scheduled a second , longer session for Monday of last week , but that turned out to be the morning he attempted suicide . He is now recuperating at the same naval hospital that cared for Lt. Col. Oliver North ' s mental problems a decade ago , and where the first secretary of defense , James Forrestal , jumped out a tower window a generation ago . Some impressions : How he started and tried to stop the Iran dealings : Israel ' s Ariel Sharon was rebuffed on this twice by Secretary of State Al Haig in May , 1981 , and May , 1982 , I was told by Haig , who brought Bud into the administration . When a former Haig aide , Michael Ledeen , broached the idea of an Iran opening to Bud in April , 1985 , McFarlane let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approach to Iran would be well received by Israel , which it was . By the end of 1985 , Bud considered his strategic probe had been a mistake and had degenerated into a hostage ransom , and thought he turned it off . Why he then quit the White House : McFarlane was neither a personal friend of Ronald Reagan ' s , like William Clark , nor a man of independent achievement , like George Shultz or Caspar Weinberger . When State and Defense clashed , McFarlane did not have the clout to resolve the issues or get the President to decide . Chief of Staff Donald Regan , certain of his own foreign policy judgment and eager to dominate , wanted a nobody in that job , and a nobody was what he got to replace McFarlane . Why he came back for a secret trip to Tehran last May : He was out of the bureaucratic cocoon for the first time and not doing well . Pundits derogated his record . I think William Casey ' s urgings and the President ' s worry about hostages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand roll of the dice . Why he became depressed : After his dealings were exposed , he at first tried to protect the President . Then the blunder was given the color of scandal by the contra diversion , and he became the only central figure providing information . Don Regan blamed him for the whole mess and contradicted his testimony . The anti-Reagan crowd reviles him as a cowboy , pro-Reagan stalwarts called him the new John Dean ; Bud had no friends at all . And I think he is still protecting the President on plenty . Did he really try to kill himself ? Yes and no . If he made a conscious decision beforehand , he would not have used Valium . Bud may not be Clausewitz , but he is not inept . Feeling abandoned and whipsawed , blaming himself for all the consequences of his errors , he impulsively gulped down the whole bottle of pills and returned to the arms of bureaucracy , this time in a hospital . In our talk , I asked how a former national security adviser , privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the hands of Iranians whose agents in Beirut tortured secrets out of their CIA hostage before killing him . Was that security gamble courageous or foolhardy ? Did he take a cyanide capsule along ? " They had more to gain from working with us , " he said tightly . I waited and he added , " Some of the preparations were grotesque . " I think this desperate and disillusioned marine , on his misbegotten mission to Tehran , was prepared to kill himself for his country . Last week ' s surrender to impulse was what psychologists call a cry for help ; Bud was not prepared to kill himself for himself . CAPTION : DRAWING : Bud McFarlane . Vallot/Rothco Cartoons .
