DR . HEIMLICH : THE MAN BEHIND THE MANEUVER A savior to thousands of choking victims , the mastermind of the Heimlich maneuver is looking at new medical problems to conquer . by Robert McKay Part II " Things do n't happen out of the blue . Apples fall on people 's heads all the time . And they either say : Ouch ! ' or : ' Hey , an apple ! What luck ! ' But then along comes a Newton and he wonders what caused the apple to fall . " Twenty-five years ago I was operating on a patient suffering from cancer of the rectum . It was a general surgical case 1 would have been doing then , not so unusual . To prevent obstruction and to control bleeding , I cauterized it . The surprising thing was that the patient did n't die , as he should have , by every sign I could see . " But no , he kept coming back every few months and did n't die . Eventually , he was so improved that we felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove more of the tumor and see what was going on inside . We operated and found cancer cells imbedded in scar tissue , very tittle , and all of the spreading had stopped . " Now this was a curious happening and it struck my interest . Some doctors would have seen a patient cured , and would have been very happy to have rendered the service . But I was intrigued . I wondered if it had happened before . I investigated the literature , checking under ' Cancer ' and ' Cauterizing ' and moving from one report to another through the cross-references and found it was a routine occurrence . There was plenty of evidence to support that in a number of cases the cauterizing had been more curative than the surgical removal . Something was going on here . This distracted me from my regular practice , of course . I was never a lucrative practitioner . " Well , I looked for a common thread to it , and considering it , I came up with a logic for why it might work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat against cold . The heat from the cauterizing radiates through the cancer that 's left , diminishing as you go further away from the source , and some temperature along that gradient was either modifying the cells in some way or destroying the cells , causing them to exude a substance that destroys other cancer cells . " Now I happen to love world 's fairs . I sold cold drinks at the 1939 New York World 's Fair in New York , the year before I entered medical school . The slogan for that fair was ' Peace and Democracy , ' and then Italy pulled out and the World War began and I wound up in China . But then I worked the stands at the American Jubilee Show . What a show ! They had a hundred people on horses , then a hundred on motorcycles , comedians , bands , a fabulous show . I saw it three times a day , knew every note . Anyway , it was at that world 's fair , or maybe another , I 'm not sure because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knoxville , when 1 saw my first laser , at an AT &T; exhibit . Later , when I was looking up lasers , I knew who the experts were . Because I had this idea of using the laser surgically , to produce the heat . " I was working as a consultant and adviser for a pharmaceutical company and I had to fly to Chicago to meet with them , and because they were paying for it , I was flying in the first-class section . I got to talking to the man next to me  --  he was a very inter- esting man  --  and I told him what I was doing , all about other things , of course , and he said , ' Here , take this . ' And he wrote a note to the chairman of the board of the lab , who was a relative of his . I turned the card over and it read : Wallace DeButts , president of Illinois Bell and vice president of AT &T.; ' Hey , ' I said , ' you 're just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this idea for adapting the laser for surgery . ' He listened and he said , ' I 'll get back to you . ' " I got a call from the home Bell lab in New Jersey a week later from a continued on following page man who identified himself as a physicist . I could tell from his tone that he was put out , he 'd been told by the Big Boss to call this doctor . Listen , I said , I do n't know Mr. DeButts . I met him on a plane and I told him I was interested in the surgical use of the laser . I knew you people were the leaders in the field . Here 's what else I 've done . And he was very helpful after that . " We set up a project and worked it out in a year . We were the first to pass a laser beam through a fiber optic and have it show up intact on the other side . I wanted to direct the beam for surgical use through fiber optics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop , as far as I was concerned , because the work was no longer related to the business of their company . " They put me in touch with the Perkin-Elmer Company in Connecticut . They were the first one to shoot a laser beam to the moon and bounce it back . They assigned some physicists to work with me , and I supplied them with fresh cancerous tissue which they cauterized with lasers using the fiber optics , and we 'd chart the results . That was in 1969 , when I moved to Cincinnati , and it went on the back burner for a while . " In 1972 , 1 filed for a grant application with the National Cancer Institute , along with Perkin-Elmer , a business-academic application , the first of its kind . I went to Washington and met with the chairman of the NCI and told him about our work , and he was very encouraging . Looks good , looks good , he said . We filled out the applications  --  it was a lot of work , presenting all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they said great , great , looks good , and then they turned us down . I vowed then never to apply for another government grant . I know how it works and where the money goes  --  it 's all political . They look at who you 're associated with , and that 's where the money goes , millions and millions , usually right down the drain . They do n't care what you 're doing , so long as you 're in the right place . " Five years later I noticed that the people on the review committee were using the laser in surgery , passing it through fiber optics . Oh , it was a most marvelous breakthrough for them . 1 suppose it could have been a natural development of their work  --  I do n't care . For me , the next idea is always just around the corner . I do n't care if people steal my work , because they can only take the idea as it is , what they see , not the concept . They know nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop it any further . " For instance , the whole concept of the hyperthermia , that it was increased body heat that was affecting the cancer in some way . They came out with that , too , spent millions on it , but all the research reflected their typical stupidity . They tried ovens ; they put people into spacesuits and raised their temperature ; into hot baths and heated paraffin , coated them with wax ; they even took blood out , warmed it , and put it back in . It was so ridiculous ! And some of this was so painful to the patients that they had to be anesthetized while it was being done . " When I think of treatment , I try to imitate the function of the body . Instead of trying to heat the body like you 'd cook food , imitate the function . If the problem is to heat thebody , then why not look at the way the body heats the body ? 1 was thinking that way when I remembered that malaria was used as the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the literature , the old history , and I found they had very good success when they chose the right strain of malaria . Essentially there are four , and two are especially suitable . One is easily curable , and will induce a good fever . It 's that fever we think could be effective against cancer . I believe it is so ; believe it myself 100 percent ; but I do n't want to hold out false hope to people . 1 have to be very careful , in my position , of my credibility . People now will believe practically anything I say , so 1 want to wait until the work is done . Already they come to my office , inoperable , terminal cases , and they ask me if they ca n't offer themselves as test cases . They 'll sign anything , because they have no other hope . I have to tell them to wait . We need to do a study . I hope it comes soon . " The Heimlich Response Dr. Heimlich is speaking with a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve his English . Dr. Heimlich is brushing up on his Spanish and correcting Eduardo 's English at the same time . They met in the Atlanta airport ; they struck up a conversation and a friendship . Eduardo was on his way to Cincinnati and Henry was return-ing from Ecuador , where he had at-tempted to establish a basis for doing his cancer research . Henry loves talk-ing with Eduardo , loves the boy him-self for what he represents  --  a citizen of the world , fellow traveler , expand-ing his horizons . Eduardo gives Henry a bag of Colombian coffee as a present and promises to see him soon . The phone rings . It 's the mayor 's office . They want to know if he 'd be willing to be on the mayor 's oyster-eating team as part of an Easter Seals benefit . He knows this would be a great occasion for many jokes about the maneuver . He 's learned to he continued on following page good-natured about that . He has to decline  --  he has already planned a skiing vacation in Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the doctor 's calendar . He 's in demand all over the world . Otherwise , though , he 'd have been glad to do it . Please call again , he says , and if there 's any way 1 can lend my support , let me know . For 16 years , Dr. Heimlich kept a fairly low profile in Cincinnati . Many people thought the guy who invented the maneuver had died a hundred years ago , and he liked it that way . The only real celebrity he had in his life came from his wife 's parents , Arthur and Katherine Murray . That was something he was always dodging , and though he was a good dancer , according to Jane , his wife , he stopped because people expected him to be sensational and he also disliked taking lessons of any kind . Gradually , his own reputation eclipsed the ballroom , but he still avoided the spotlight , at least in Cincinnati , cherishing his privacy . Lately , he 's been coming out of that shell . Partly it 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Also , he believes in lending his support to good causes . Another reason for becoming more active in the community is that he would like something in return : money . He wants to see if Cincinnati is willing to make a financial commitment to keep him there . He has offers to work elsewhere . He 's seeking $2 million in endowment funds for his institute . It 's not an unprecedented request . A few years ago another fellow , Pete Rose , considered himself undervalued in the local market and took his services elsewhere . When Dr. Heimlich left Jewish Hospital after eight years as chief of surgery , Ralph Corbett gave him a grant that kept him there . Xavier now gives him a home and his freedom . But he needs the money to do his work . Eduardo leaves and Dr. Heimlich , shaking his head in admiration , asks a colleague : " Is n't that just great ? Is n't that what it 's all about ? " Then he drives home for lunch , to a large old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , who 's 98 yearsold and quite alert , tending only to remember the events of 40 years ago in sharper detail than what happened yesterday . Dr. Heimlich calls his father pop , as does everyone else who knows him . Pop was trained as an architect but devoted the energy of his life to social work , particularly in the area of correctional reform . The house is filled with Dr. Heimlich 's plaques and trophies and awards and oddments from around the world : ancient dueling pistols , Buddhas , Mongolian eating sets , jade and bamboo carvings . Pop 's room upstairs is crammed with his mementos too , and he is proudest of all of a plaque from the " Welfare League of Sing-Sing Prison , " a group of prisoners who wanted to thank him for caring about them . Like father , like son : When Phil Heimlich had an idea he thought was right , nothing could persuade him otherwise , and he 'd be determined to test it out . One of his theories , radical at the time where juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treated determined how you would turn out . As part of the test for that theory , he shipped his ten-year-old son off for ten weeks at a camp for delinquent boys . Was he afraid he might be wrong ? No . But what if he had been , and his son had been harmed ? But 1 was right ! he says , laughing . Young Henry and his sister used to roam through the New York State maximum-security prisons freely and untroubled , because they were Phil Heimlich 's kids , and Phil Heimlich was known as a man who treated everyone fairly , as an in-dividual . That position was not without its controversy . Dr. Heimlich 's mother , who died in 1968 , wanted her young and talented Jewish son to be a doctor . That was entirely natural , the thing to do . He would help his fellow man and never want for money , or prestige . But whether it was because he was his mother 's baby boy or because he inherited his father 's stubborn , righteous way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things in his own way , following up on notions that sparked his intellect , not tracing the well-marked path of a thoracic surgeon 's practice . He is a reserved man , not an extrovert . He says his own children taught him to open up and to say things like " I love you . " Only in the past eight years , he says , have he and his father grown close . He 's also financially conservative , calling himself a child of the Depression . Only recently has he purchased a car with all the extras , and it 's a Honda . On a business trip not long ago , he bought a topcoat in New York , quite a luxury . But there is a deeper independent streak in the man , something quite aloof that gives him almost a bravura aspect , like a hero in the operas he loves so much , or a character out of The Music Man , whose songs he knows so well . He grew up playing the clarinet and the piano , but while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be a member of the band . He had to lead it , and so he became the drum major , yes , the high hat , chin strap , whistle , baton , the boots , the works . He says he has led a charmed life . Things had a way of working out for him . Life has been kind . While he was at Cornell , the school fielded a strong football team , its best in years , one that traveled to Columbus to play Ohio State . They beat Ohio State and there in front of 80,000 people , Hank Heimlich was leading his Big Red Band  --  he calls it , to this day , " my band . " He says he does not understand what " ego " means . He does not seem to be an immodest , arrogant man . But he is inflexible and full of a concontinued on page 72 72 Heirnlich continued from page 34 fidence tempered and honed by his experience . He does consider himself to be exceptional , with a record to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with doctors , a rigid peer group , seething with petty gripes and animosities . He is well aware that if his work has won him admirers and made him a folk hero , his personality has not won him many friends . At Jewish Hospital he was criticized for not performing his share of the routine surgery and for taking controversial stands . He felt that with his experience he should be concentrating on unusual surgical problems , leaving the routine matters to the young doctors , residents , and interns who should be glad for such work . He remembers a time when he could not get any work . And he says : " I have no interest in doing ten hernias in a row . The president of a company does not work on the loading docks . " As for taking controversial positions on topics perhaps not directly related to the practice of medicine , he feels that is his obligation . He owes it to the world and the fame he has achieved to stand up for what he knows is right . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer experts are saying he is wrong , and working far afield from his area of expertise ; world diplomats say he is excessively naive , commenting on highly complicated affairs he knows nothing about , and maybe a little " off his rocker " ; and fellow doctors say he 's a vain and self-centered man who got lucky , and now he thinks he 's an oracle , the Font of All Wisdom . The Heimlich Fortune Dr. Heimlich protested a planned series of experiments at the University of Florida in which 42 dogs were to be purposely drowned . His letter argued that the experiment , subsequently canceled , was cruel and useless . This small battle is part of the larger , ongoing war he is fighting with the Red Cross over the Heimlich maneuver . The Red . Cross , like nations in inter-national disputes , does n't even recognize the maneuver . It does make vague reference to an " upward abdominal thrust , " never endorsing it completely . Dr. Heimlich 's unswerving position is that the maneuver is the action of choice with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infuriated by the infighting and back-stabbing that go on within the medical community over the adoption of his maneuver as the standard lifesaving operation . But he 's used to it , taking people on . He challenged Pan Am when they gave his airline tickets to another customer when he was about to leave on his honeymoon . He wrote a letter to David Rockefeller and threatened to take the Chase Manhattan Bank before the FCC for false advertising ? " You 've got a friend in Chase Manhattan " ? when he was unable to recover funds involved in a check forgery . For years now it 's been the Red Cross , and now he 's moving up to the international level . The morning mail also brings him a letter from Bucharest , from a doctor he has not seen since 1956 , when he traveled to Rumania to exchange information with the only other doctor in the world performing the replacement esophagus operation , in which the lower part of the stomach , which secretes no acid , is sewn or stapledoff , then cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still intact , to replace the damaged esophagus . Dr. Heimlich developed the technique during a meeting . It came to him whole and in detail . He knew immediately it would work . Afterward , he scribbled the basic procedure on a napkin for the chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital , and the man ignored it . Undaunted , Dr. Heimlich , then 30 years old , walked down the street to the New York Medical College and wrangled the use of lab space and a $300 grant to test his theory on dogs . Working alone , he could not keep the animals alive through the surgery . Some interns he was teaching helped him out ; when a dog finally did survive , he paid the animal custodian $5 for each week he could keep it alive . He published a paper on the operation , but it was several years before he got a chance to perform it on a human patient . When he did , he altered his technique , and the man died . That , Dr. Heimlich says , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your idea . He did not stop . When he got a second chance at another hospital , the operation went smoothly and the patient , previously terminal , recovered . It became one of Dr. Heimlich 's favorite stories : The man was wheeled into a conference , given bread and coffee and told to eat . " I ca n't , " he said , and the doctors in the room roared with laughter , a laughter of ridicule , Dr. Heimlichsays . " Why not ? " he asked the man . " You 've been eating all week . " " Because they did n't bring my teeth out , " the man said . And then we all laughed , Dr. Heimlich says , a laugh he still enjoys as much as ever . This was after he had returned from Rumania and experienced conditions behind the Iron Curtain . He believes that the cooperation between physicians led to a better spirit between the two countries , an experience he uses to motivate his current peace proposals . The doctor he knew then recently heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 the Voice of America , on the Heimlich Maneuver and Patriots for Peace . Dr. Heimlich breaks for lunch . He 's going to his favorite Chinese restaurant in town , the Blue Gibbon in Saint Bernard . On the way , he slips in a Spanish-language cassette and practices his conversation . He passes a billboard that reads : " What would America be without the Red Cross ? " He laughs aloud and says , " Boy , I could give them a good answer to that one ! " At the restaurant , he orders egg-drop soup and chicken chow mein in Chinese and converses briefly with the waiter , asking about the family and how things are , all in Chinese . The waiter departs and the doctor thinks about recent developments in his own family . His older son , a local lawyer , has just announced his engagement ; one of his twin daughters is holding down two waitressing jobs in San Francisco while she tries to find work as a model . He has a book on emergency borne medical techniques , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie . For some reason , his thoughts drift back a few years to when he was working with Neil Armstrong , George Rieveschl , and Ed Patrick on the development of a miniaturized heart-lung machine and the techniques for implanting it . Rieveschl called the group HARP , after their initials . Even that gathering of minds ran into trouble , though . Other professors believed they 'd have a monopoly on the grant money , leaving none for the less famous researchers . An institute was formed , but the spirit was gone by then , and nothing came of their work . Still , Dr. Heimlich remembers a couple of wonderful years when they worked together , screaming , yelling , laughing like kids , eating lunch together at the Alumni Club at the University of Cincinnati . A couple around his age comes over to his table and interrupts his thoughts . " You 're Dr. Heimlich , are n't you ? " the man says . Dr. Heimlich nods , smiling . " I thought I recognized you from TV . " The man introduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " I owe her life to you . " // The woman blushes and explains . " We were eating in a restaurant several years ago and I choked on a piece of meat . 1 tried to tell him , but he did n't understand . " " I thought she was having a heart attack . " " That 's very common , " Dr. Heimlich says . " I was dying , " the woman says . " Lucky for me a nurse was nearby , and she came over , grabbed me from behind , jerked , and out popped that piece of meat . I ca n't thank you enough . " They try , thanking him profusely . Dr. Heimlich graciously accepts their thanks , and he urges them to send in a detailed description of their experience to his institute at Xavier . They shake hands around and the couple departs . It 's a gratifying experience , and it 's one that happens to him frequently , not so much in person , but more often through the mail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that has been his goal . Finished with his meal , Dr. Heimlich signs the bill , takes a sip of water , 85 and opens his fortune cookie . " You are contemplating some action which will bring great credit upon you , " it says . He laughs out loud . " That 's a safe bet , " he says , getting up and walking away . X Family Tree continued from page 49 finally streamed from the house and began circling the backyard , with Un-cle Cotton lumbering along behind , rabbit and dog were nowhere in sight . " Watch out for the cistern ! " dad yelled to Uncle Cotton . But the cis-tern top was camouflaged by snow , and Uncle Cotton was already upon it ; because the top was n't designed to support 350 estimated pounds , he was through it , then he was in the cistern itself . Although the water level was only hip high , a whirlpool spa the cistern was n't .
