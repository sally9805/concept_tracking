txt // television they have been re-erected . This issue is central to accountability . ITV has always been regulated by Act of Parliament . leading to a potentially more restrictive regime ? enforced by a nervous ITA ( subsequently IBA ) . Satire came late to commercial television in the UK for this reason . The BBC has had the additional and vital freedoms implied by the Royal Charter . Greene , in some respects , was the first to capitalise on them . As the sixties wore on he was of course following , not leading , the iconoclasms of ' swinging London ' , although some of the first prompting came through broadcasting . Television producers and managers argue that they are highly responsive to public taste and do not attempt to override it . What they do is to nudge the audience towards listening to and watching programmes in which their prejudices are challenged . There is no doubt that there is pressure through playrights and drama producers to push to the limits , on more than odd occasions , what audiences will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasting reflects British culture . The 1960s saw massive fractures in the fabric of what had become an over-stuffy society still obsessed with past glories , wrapped in the fabric of social class . But these fractures had already appeared in British society after the Second World War and during the loss of the Empire . Changes there had to be and the BBC 's own programmes became part of the message . Few would want now to return to the hypocrisies of the 1950s , although there were apparent stabilities as well . At the same time the opening of windows , undertaken with such insouciance by Hugh Greene 's men , has led to much agonising over the effects of television on , for instance , young people . It has led to the partially successful efforts of Mrs Whitehouse in getting the question of censorship back on the political agenda , even to the point where senior cabinet ministers appear to embrace it . Broadcasters have been accused of irresponsibility because they failed in the past to recognise that television might just be having more of an impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the BBC in the 1960s was that the opening of windows was never intended to allow the public directly to express a view : even in the 1960s they were perceived as passive witnesses to the wonders of the box . Producers by and large did not expect audiences to bite back ; hence the opprobrium heaped on Mrs Whitehouse 's head . The audience was regained for the BBC ; by the end of the decade // it was regularly winning ' the weekly share game ( albeit that with two channels it had a natural advantage ) . At the same time it was still distant with its audience . It is possible to speculate this was as much to do with the nature of television as anything . Television by the 1960s had become a massive industry with huge overheads . It worked on a kind of ersatz Hollywood star system where the public were allowed to gawp in awe at whatever new television personality was thrust at them . Radio had had its personalities but , as the 1970s were to re-discover , it had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach . Winning the audience back worked for the BBC but at a bigger price than expected . What Hugh Greene and his executives and producers developed was a theory of professionalism : that is , public service broadcasting as conceived by Reith had to give way to a new definition . That definition was that the only reason for having the BBC was that it understood public taste and responded to it ( rather than was led by it ) . The nature of that response was professionalism . The model that came to dominate was that of journalism . The BBC adopted for its general programming a view that went like this : What are good programmes ? What we understand them to be ? viewed from our professional eyries . The audience , under this system , was given what it wanted but in a laundered fashion . There were inevitable middle-class assumptions here too but larded with the sixties style of irreverent superficiality . Of course , to describe a gigantic broadcasting organisation in such general terms is to invite immediate retort : But what about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . If an irreverence ruled at Television Centre , egged on by Broadcasting House , there were also producers who made stunning social documentaries like Cathy Come Home ' . The underlying problem , not obvious at the time , was that by shifting the philosophic basis of the BBC from the absolute values of the Reithian system , the mandarins of the sixties let in value-relativism . Everything , potentially , was up for discussion , including our system of broadcasting . It is possible to argue that this had already been challenged successfully by the breaking of the monopoly in 1955 . But ITV , although popular with the mass audience , had been much berated by the Pilkington Committee in 1962 and was beginning to reform itself . In any case , unfairly perhaps , ITV has always been let off the values hook by being commercially financed . ' I'he BBC had assiduously espoused values as part of its bedrock . For // nigh on twenty years few have challenged internally what those values might be . As an example of this , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking fundamental purpose ' questions . They were far too busy looking at the accounts . Audiences might well have begun to return to the BBC had the latter merely tinkered with programme policies , not effectively thrown them out . But Greene was an iconoclast , a kind of Reithian in reverse . The threat may have been an ITV taking all the audience ( unlikely though that ever was ) but Greene used it to de-construct the BBC . Reith , still alive at that time , may have understood this . He first rather liked Greene ; later , he could not bear him . The 1970s were a period of relative calm in broadcasting . Although punctuated by the deliberations of the Annan Committee , the turbulence of technological and political controversy which has characterised the 1980s was missing . For the BBC , audience levels for television remained satisfyingly high . And with the slow but sure growth of BBC local radio , as well as the discovery of the networks by a new generation of radio listeners , all seemed well . As Radio One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the BBC could relax . Yet hindsight would suggest that the 1970s were uneasy times . The Annan Committee , much ignored in its elaborate and messy conclusions , did point to problems soon to appear for all broadcasting . In describing the cosiness of what they called the ' duopoly ' they unconsciously drew attention to its over-neat parcelling up , cartelisation , of broadcasting and its audiences . A growing mood of agitation was saying that radio was not local enough ( a still unresolved issue ) and that , at least for producers outside the programme companies and the BBC , there was simply no real work available . The corporate video had yet to develop ; as indeed , had the surge of ownership of video cassette recorders . Cable too , was an unknown quantity ; even more so , direct satellite broadcasting . The first big change came with Channel Four , as it happened , disposed finally by a Conservative Government of a markedly radical view . William Whitelaw , at the time Home Secretary , effectively cashed all his political chips in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BBC came up for discussion , much later , he was powerless to defend it from repeated attack , as also from the vagaries of the Peacock Committee . // Channel Four has posed a central challenge merely by being the youngest service in British television . It is no accident that it wants to believe that its audience profile is heavily weighted to the younger age groups , a result of deliberate programme policies from within the channel . ( In fact this weighting is not real : its audience profile matches the other three channels ? most people watch it some of the time . ) The recovery of the audience , perhaps its re-discovery , has in part been effected through Channel Four . There is also a recognition that what audiences want , what they will accept , is growing more and more apart from what broadcasters continue to offer . The onset of a vastly increased choice may finally make this clear . Channel Four has its own problems , however , where audiences are concerned . Not least among them is the degree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , in any other than the most superficial way , of what audiences want . The channel uses pressure groups as its primary focus in this respect , the second level of a two-step flow of communication , removed from the audience proper . But these pressure groups represent pressures , not people , and although Channel Four had built up strong loyalties six years into its life , its original purposes are being lost in the daily pragmatics of scheduling and programme making . There is a two-way process going on , though . Broadcasters have been able to assume that , as far as audiences go , what they have offered as accountability , however jejune , has been out of the goodness of their , the broadcasters ' , hearts . For many years , possibly overawed by the sheer technological mastery of the airwaves , the hulk of the public accepted it . The apparent passivity of an audience sitting at home , tired after a day 's work , may also have added to this . But as technology enters the home , as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same technology offers choice , so the public begin to ask consumer questions about output , about content ? and about control . Indeed , modern technology aims to give them control , through the vcr , the remote button , through massive channel choice delivered via cable or satellite . Another factor enters the equation , altering the balance between BBC broadcaster and audience for all time : money . As the natural increase in licence revenue bottoms out to a constant sum so the BBC has to rely more and more on the public 's willingness to pay . The BBC recognised this in 1979 when it went public for the first time on the licence fee campaign . In effect it asked the licence payer to accept // the accounts ? and by implication the programme policies on which those accounts rested . As it happens , more and more programme makers are beginning to ask what their relationship is with their audiences . The public are no longer willing to accept the pure dictates of broadcasters ? or anyone else . Evidence is growing of a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting programmes against truth . The public mechanisms of accountability have grown . Fuelled in this area at least by the Annan Committee , itself worried deeply both by the impact of television and by the apparent lack of control ( including self-control ) exercised within the broadcasting industry , various means have been employed by broadcasters to give semblance to listening to the public , along with some genuine attempts at feedback . Feedback programmes , public meetings , more advisory groups and a better use of them , all contributed to a re-discovery of the audience , along with ? most important of all ? an apparent determination by broadcastings ' managers , at least in the BBC , to re-align their central relationship with the general public . This public ( not necessarily the same as an audience ' ) is being asked to accept the BBC on different terms ? carrying great dangers for the corporation , incidentally . But while the BBC may talk of shareholders ? may even come to believe it ? the very idea of a mass audience is being challenged all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated about what they want , and when they want it , do the rest . In Channel Four , with its knowledge of the small audiences it aims to get for most programmes , this is less a problem . For the BBC , believing as it still does , fiercely , that it has to retain around a 40 ? 45 per cent minimum mass audience to be viable , the problem grows . 3 Theory and Practices . the Secretary of State ... may from time to time ... ' It is the underlying assumption in Britain that broadcasters are free to do what they want ? apart from constraints under the law . Thus broadcasters may be sued for defamation , may commit contempt of court , can incur penalties under the Official Secrets Act . Broadcasters and journalists have no additional legal rights to those of members of the public ; they do enjoy certain custom and practice privileges , in Parliament , in local authority meetings , in the courts . Broadcasting , as it happens , was born on a tide of extraordinary caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and not always clear-cut shift towards greater freedom . Sometimes broadcasters have shot themselves spectacularly in the foot as did the BBC when it voluntarily agreed in 1944 that it would not broadcast any matter likely to come up for discussion in Parliament in the following two weeks . The 14-Day Rule ' stayed in force voluntarily ' for more than a decade ; the BBC Caversham archive is littered with letters sent back and forth between the BBC and politicians . The BBC of course was trying to argue a way out . Needless to say , having been handed such a plum example of self-censorship politicians fought with great tenacity and cunning to keep the rule in force . Naivete like this cost the BBC dearly . Broadcasting , and television especially , is a politician 's dream ; it is also his nightmare . The ambivalence of the relationship is everywhere to be seen and heard . On the one hand politicians fondly believe that if only they had unrestricted access to microphone or camera they could convince the electorate of their worth ; on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy to have such total access and thereby control , is to destroy the credibility they crave . The result is the daily battle for the hearts and minds of broadcasters and through them audiences , the general public . The struggle revolves around the constant whingeing by politicians that they are not treated fairly . Hence their ludicrous clinging to party politicial broadcasts flying their unrestrictedly partisan flags in the face of overwhelming evidence that the audience finds these broadcasts among the least palatable of all the output . But broadcasters are not innocents in this game . Their desire is for good radio or television . To suggest that their 35 // business is entrapment is to go too far but it would perhaps be fair to suggest that they do want to see politicians act out pre-set dramas . Professionally ' this is known as good broadcasting ' . Both sides might be accused of wilfully failing to understand although it can be difficult to disentangle the truth of the sometimes excessive remarks made on both sides about the motives of the other . More probably neither side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to the political process . Indeed , this is at the heart of a constantly problematic relationship in democracies , for no one appears to have tried to assess whether broadcasting makes a material difference to politics . Can extended serious current affairs output contend with the growing entertainment output except , ludicrously , to mimic it ? Formally , broadcasters are accountable to Parliament . That is where the BBC and the IBA report each year . Parliament ( and through it ministers of the Crown ) has absolute power to do what it will with broadcasting in the UK . Again formally , the fact that it does not in general overtly try to influence broadcasting except through Acts of Parliament , fully debated , is a part of what democracy means . So when Leon Brittan wrote to the BBC to suggest that their film of two extremists in Northern Ireland would , if shown , be against the national interest , he transgressed an admittedly unwritten rule . His transgression may have contributed to his eventual loss of job . ( For the full story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability is not the key ; as with so much in the British Constitution reality and power lie elsewhere , in the informal structure . There we find a continuous struggle between broadcasters and politicians . There is an important difference between the two parts of the British broadcasting system ' . The BBC is governed by Royal Charter guaranteeing its rights and specifying its duties . Over time these duties have multiplied ? the requirement to provide increasing numbers of advisory bodies , for example . Nevertheless the BBC has a permissive existence . The commercial sector is controlled by an Act of Parliament . Acts are restrictive on the whole , telling people what they may not do . The reason for this considerable difference between the IBA and the BBC is that when commercial television was mooted it was decided that in order to curb what were thought to be its likely excesses a tighter regulatory rein was needed . The original Act has been much amended , most recently to take // account of the very different arrangements planned for Channel Four , and for planned developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , however , that the IBA does in theory operate in a much more controlled environment . Although politicians require access to all broadcast media they have always concentrated their maximum efforts behind the scenes on subverting the BBC ( this is not , I believe , too strong a word to describe the process ) . There are a number of reasons for this . First , the BBC is centrally organised and located . It runs national networks as well as regional and local services . Second , it has frequently described itself as the national instrument of broadcasting and has been keen to point this out to all and sundry . And so officially it continues to be , . a salience which suggests that whatever else may happen to it , it will not cease to be the primary broadcasting organisation in the country . At the same time the BBC has become more coy about the relevance of being designated the national instrument of broadcasting ' . Third , it has maintained a high prestige . It manages , although less obviously than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fainter perfume of real power , born from its heady days as the unchallenged doyen of broadcasting services . MPs almost certainly still prefer to appear on the BBC , although ITN 's News at Ten and Channel Four News must now run it close seconds . The regional structure of ITV also stands in the way of its being perceived as the more important service to be seen on although this does not apply to the News . The regional structure is even more true of local radio , both commercial and BBC , although the trade-off here is that individual MPs can talk most easily to their local constituents . The result may be a perception of the local and national broadcast system but little appreciation of the regional . Finally , and how important is this factor is hard to determine , the BBC plays the same kind of institutional power game as does Westminster : the BBC likes to believe it is close to the centres of power ? in the absence , one can surmise , of having money-making as an institutional goal . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be put through to Number 10 Downing Street and is similar to the senior Fleet Street journalist 's boast about how many private telephone numbers he or she has of VIPs . If politics is the art of the possible broadcasting provides ? or seems to provide ? new possibilities of power , of influence , of legitimation. // Its technology confers the latter in a frame which listeners and viewers assimilate as reality . Politicians , governments , all of the state apparatuses , have realised the potency of a technology which enables an individual to speak simultaneously to a whole population . From the beginning of broadcasting , then , the means of its organisation and accountability have been of the greatest concern to Government and to the whole political system . Until very recently European political systems have had the perfect neutral ' device at hand to help them maintain a grip on broadcasting : frequency shortages . This technological imperative has international overtones reaching across the world . Successive British governments from the mid-thirties , have been able to say their hands were tied by international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to go along with this in order to obstruct , in particular , commercial radio . It consistently produced data in the 1960s which purported to show that any extension of the number of radio stations was impossible . What they did not reveal were the engineering assumptions built in . More recently the potential onset of frequency glut has created a dilemma for the Conservative Government who have ostensibly wished to authorise community radio . The frequency argument no longer applicable , the new wisdom was until 1988 that such stations would be unable to police their own airwaves , relying as they must on amateur broadcasters who , it is suggested , would lard the air with obscenities and incitements and , more seriously , contempts prejudicial to trials . Although there may some truth in this it is equally possible to see the underlying concern to be one of Government control ? or lack of it ? over the airwaves . Nevertheless , the Government , late in 1988 , agreed to authorise the first 26 community radio stations . But there have been other means used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of these has been the concept of balance ' , a term which has been taken to mean a strict reflection of the two-party system of British government . This has of course been challenged by the emergence of fringe nationalist parties in Scotland , Wales and , most awkwardly , Northern Ireland ; and by the growth of Liberal , latterly SDP and Alliance and now Democrat support . This last development has posed a different order of problem as it is not inconceivable that a coalition may form part of , if not a whole , future Government . Balance has indeed been used to inform more than just party politics . It has been used in the structuring of the whole system : as a // direct restriction on programme output ( Channel Four have had continuous problems with the IBA , as opposed to the Broadcasting Act , on this question ) ; between public service and commercial impetus ; between centre and periphery ; professionalism and accountability ; integrity ( of broadcasting ) and access . None of this suggests that broadcasting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain kinds of freedom but it is to suggest there is a considerable area of grey in which definitions are unclear , under attack from one side or another . The political arena is the most critical , far more important to both the BBC and the IBA ( and by extension , eventually , even to Channel Four ) than any individual member of the public , or any collectivity , any pressure group or lobby . Because broadcasting is a central part of the political process primary accountability is implicit in the working arrangements between broadcasters and politicians . It is for this reason , among others , that both sides get so upset when they perceive the rules ' to have been broken . The same applies to broadcasters , when MPs try to debate programme content ' in terms of the incumbent Government acting on it in some way ; and politicians when they believe that the BBC ( in particular ) has transgressed the line on balance ? such as over its coverage of South Africa ( in 1986 ) . The system of broadcasting may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political processes lies the management of the BBC ; further away the IBA . Programme makers swing closer and further away depending on their output . Current affairs producers may find a pressure exerted almost continuously at one level : mundanely , to have a spokesman from each of the main parties on a topic ; more controversially , senior editors may be under a different , longer-term pressure to ensure balance ' . This pressure is likely to be well internalised by now . Part of the problematic area of the socialisation which goes on in British broadcasting ? and especially in the BBC ? is the extent to which rules are incorporated into an individual 's belief system . Broadcasting of necessity enforces a constant time restriction . Unless ideas like balance can be made effectively a part of a producer 's moral code then trouble will not be far away . At senior levels too there will , on many political issues , be direct pressure from the main parties exercised by telephone calls and by a constant , trickling form of lobbying through lunches , suppers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the political arena in every sense . Its past demonstrates ? some would say this was the // problem ? how well corporate wisdom kept the BBC safe in these shark infested waters . It has , however , relied upon its internalised instincts to ensure that its finest unassailable defence is political impartiality ' ? a term which has come to replace the cruder concept of balance ' . Alas that the 1980s , in the re-definition of politics into combative form , have dictated that balance itself should emerge as a highly political idea , even as new political parties . Broadcasters may be too easily seen by outsiders as victims in these processes , constantly under threat . Yet they have great residual power : they set the agenda , they edit the tapes ; they schedule . To politicians this can look like a great amount of freedom . The belief that broadcasting is also highly influential is also a factor here . Broadcasters and politicians are in agreement that the medium is powerful , whatever research evidence there might be to the contrary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy level : they can change the arrangements and the relationships ; they can move key personnel under the system of patronage which enables prime ministers to appoint governors to the BBC , members to the IBA . In previous research I spent some time examining how this had worked in practice . Certain curiosities came to light . Principally , it has been Conservative governments which have been responsible for what I categorised as nodal ' decision-taking in broadcast policy . A Conservative government had introduced the BBC ; permitted commercial television and commercial radio ; finally introduced Channel Four , planned for cable and , in 1985 , permitted the public to tune satellite dishes to pick up any DBS signal they could locate . Labour governments by contrast have tinkered , dealing more with personnel and with paper than with hard change . Similarly with the enquiries into broadcasting . Of the eight major ones so far ( including Selsdon and Peacock ) Conservative governments have ordered four ( I exclude Ullswater under this heading although the National Government was dominated by the Conservative party ; the Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was initiated after pressure was brought to bear through the Conservatives in Parliament ; back-bench Tory MPs had wanted an enquiry effectively from the end of the Second World War . It is worth asking why this should be so . In the period under question Conservative governments have been more in evidence ; in those 63 years there have been Labour governments for 20 years , National governments or coalitions for 15 years ; Conservative governments for 28 years . But this is not an overwhelming difference ; // until 1979 there was a rough balance . There have always been accidental factors in the way broadcasting policy has been made : technical changes , international pressures ; more importantly , domestically , defence pressures . To keep a domestic electronics industry alive and well in the 1950s for instance , commercial television was permitted , ensuring that the Japanese invasion ( then not even on the horizon ) was kept at bay for a further decade . The Labour party has tended to be in government at times when broadcasting is going through a settled phase . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was in decline , the Labour party still flexing its national political muscles . The formation of the BBC suited the Labour party as it appeared to represent an ideal type of nationalised body and more likely to espouse socialism under the imperative of balance . Later , the Labour Government of 1950 was already dying when Beveridge recommended far-reaching devolution as a solution to the BBC 's monolithic centralism . In the 1960s Wilson 's governments were over-extended on the economic front ; the introduction of BBC local radio , in return for the BBC starting Radio One as a successor to pirate radio , merely reflected the conclusions of the Pilkington Committee . Finally , although it was a Wilson government which ordered the Annan Committee enquiry , once the report was delivered vacillation in the Home Office made certain it would be a Conservative government which disposed of the fourth television channel , although this was an ' accident ' of the electorate in 1979 . Description alone does not help to explain the dominance of the Conservative party in the central decision-taking process of broadcasting policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during an interview for earlier research , that it is all down to ' denationalisation ' ) . One hypothesis has been that broadcasting policy may best be understood , other than superficially , as the exercise of influence over two forms of consensus : what I have called elsewhere the contingent and the absolute . The former is constantly fought over and is the stuff of everyday politics ; the latter consists in those values certain kinds of society will generally adhere to because they represent a kind of social bottom line . Of course these two may come into question , as indeed may ? some would say already has ? the whole notion of consensus . The assumptions to be made are that broadcasting does have an impact at the level of social values , and that the Conservative party is somehow aware of that in a way that the Labour party is not . From archival evidence in Conservative Central Office and elsewhere it is clear Conservatives have long thought broadcasting to be an important technology for the propagandising of their view . Conservative Central Office were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The BBC , unconsciously or not , took part in another crucial element in much Conservative thinking , namely the concept of One Nation . What better way to demonstrate that idea than through the nationally co-ordinated broadcasting processes of the BBC ? Conservative governments have used broadcasting , and continue to do so , in order to develop ideas about their general policy . Thus the coming of commercial television was linked quite openly with the heralded onset of consumerism and twenty years later Edward Heath was able to develop themes around the need to revitalise business , especially small business , parallel to a policy on commercial radio . And now Channel Four helps to develop small businesses , albeit this time within the industry , while showing in its performance the exercise of Thatcherist economic constraints , market economy accounting and diversity of output ( by providing another kind of market place ) . // Cable and satellite policies are designed with the same outcome in mind . They also , it is said . offer choice ' , which has come to have a mystical significance within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time the second Conservative Government of Mrs Thatcher apparently walks an awkward protectionist path in trying to get direct broadcast satellites engineered under British specifications . This is perfectly consistent with Conservative party philosophy , if apparently inconsistent with their public position . All of this points to a close understanding by the Conservative party that broadcasting is important , very important , to the political system not just because of its coverage of politics but because it also ' sells ' social values . In terms of attitudes towards broadcasting , and the BBC in particular , the general rule has been broad Conservative party support . That this was lost at Westminster in the mid-1980s , certainly in large part , is due to the fissure between what the new Right have been able to determine as central Conservative party ideology , against the old values of the BBC , many of which were conservative in tone and outlook . Conservative MPs are not unanimous . For instance in 1986 there were probably three groups differing considerably over what they wanted to do about broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was , including finance through the licence fee . A further third , many among the intake in 1979 and especially 1983 , believed that the BBC should in some way be sold off . The final third were worried about the direction they perceived the BBC to be taking . This may have been based partly on the general perception within the Right in Parliament of the line taken by the BBC in the Falklands crisis . In short , it was possible by 1985 ? 86 to argue that the BBC had become to many Conservative MPs a kind of political opposition . First , it had kept open all kinds of national debate , which the Labour party had signally failed to do , wrapped up as it was with its continuous set of internal problems since the early eighties . The BBC can be seen in one real sense to be the official political opposition since the mid-1980s . Second , the BBC still represents one of the more public examples of a part-nationalised industry ( albeit a very specialist one ) which by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if passive , goodwill . It is , therefore , a symbol of what the Conservative Government would like to curtail , if not totally remove . Third , and most dangerously according to some Conservative party // ideologues ( and ironically those of the Left as well ) , the BBC expresses in a form of living symbolism the possibility of a consensually organised society of the kind they themselves have attempted to erode . The tradition of public service itself cuts into the heart of the newer , more abrasive , philosophy that says the market is all . Even ITV and ILR are brought into this equation because their form arises from that of the BBC ; that is , they have certain rights ( monopoly of advertising sales , monopoly of franchise areas ) only because the BBC does not have them . The Labour party in the past 20 years has also concluded that the BBC is a problem ' , although the instinct of the centre of that party is to leave well alone . For many years it was the inherent belief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept Labour criticism to a minimum . The experiences of the Labour Governments between 1964 and 1970 have been used to explain subsequent Labour party dislike of the BBC and the Annan Committee was a direct result ( setting it up for the second time was one of Wilson 's first acts in 10 Downing Street in 1974 ) . But since then the Labour party has changed . Arguably it has no direct policy on the mass media , although publicly members of the Shadow Cabinet support the maintenance of the BBC . In fact an incoming Labour Government would be likely to make substantial changes in future funding arrangements and , as soon as feasible , in the composition of the BBC Board of Governors . It was a Labour Government proposal to hamstring the BBC with Boards of Management in the 1978 White Paper . The emerging third forces in British politics , the Democrats , the SDP ? even the Greens ? have also much to criticise in the BBC , notably that it fails to give them enough credit or , more critically , air-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malaise which for the Democrats reaches right back to the nature of the single non-transferable vote , again does not help the BBC . Broadcasters in the mid-1980s had won substantial freedoms from the political system . All this was threatened : more than any the BBC , at the heart of the system , was no longer perceived as inviolate , though neither the brilliance of Conservative government propaganda nor Labour Opposition spite alone was the danger . In larger part it was a failure by broadcasters to come up with anything other than the same increasingly tired justifications for what they did . Coverage of politics by broadcasters was patchy . The tendency of broadcasting as a medium ( more true of television than radio ) to entertain at all times // did not help serious debate . Although some political programmes had notable successes others appeared to denigrate the changing fortunes ( and views ) of politicians as examples of at best feeble-mindedness , at worst culpable deception of the electorate . Broadcasting , when it did this , arguably brought democracy itself into contempt . The political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a temptation to use this as an excuse to personalise and trivialise . But broadcasters have had ample opportunity to prevent that from happening . They , like the Press , had decided to turn much political coverage into a circus , a long-running faintly amusing soap opera . When programmes like Real Lives are made ? not , perhaps , a particularly good film ? they do at least try to open a window in the stuffy hot-house of parliamentary-led politics . They point to political issues crying out to be be ventilated before an audience itself disillusioned with much political hot air . It may be that television is a medium which inevitably and inexorably falls into the amusement mode of discourse ? see especially Postman ( 1986 ) on this question . Competition for audiences , however , lay behind much of the trend ; competition not just between channels but between programme tranches as well , the common assumption being that if politics is intrinsically not interesting to audiences then its coverage , at least , has to be pure jazz . The judgement , growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applaud political coverage ; neither , it seems , did they much applaud politicians , other than those who could perform well on television . If that is the case part of the problem is possibly that the very high levels of exposure of politicians in broadcasting lends weight to a law of diminishing credibility . Anthony King 's thesis of government overload is important here because media exposure would limit space for action even further . Equally , politicians caught in the media spotlight feel strong pressure to say anything rather than remain silent , to regret a loose tongue at leisure . ( The fall of Edwina Currie , late in 1988 , illustrates this to perfection . ) In all this , broadcasting can legitimately claim it is not entirely at fault . But as I have already suggested , not to have developed a sufficiently tight code of ethics , not to have been aware that to hide behind professional ' judgements in an area where the whole question of professionalism is in doubt , is to court disaster . Politicians are themselves the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows . // The nature of broadcasting , then , is that it is locked alongside and into central political processes ; of necessity it is inside the State though trying to pull free . It has been suggested that part of the problem is that , unlike the Press , broadcasting has not yet had an opportunity to fight the great fight for liberty . Such a view is cosy but false . The British Press never fought that fight ; like broadcasting it has suffered for it . There has been much rhetoric about the extension of Press freedom ; much hyperbole . History suggests that the Press ducked the bigger battles in favour of compromise , and a share of the Establishment 's fireside ? begrudgingly bestowed . Like the Press , broadcasting 's room to manoeuvre will be determined by its economic freedom . The BBC , in having to return time and again to governments for licence fee increases is restricted in its freedom to operate , even in a benign climate . But the climate has been anything but benign for some years and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part of the changing climate has been the development of an external body of control on broadcasters : the first of these was the Broadcasting Complaints Commission . FREEDOMS , RESPONSIBILITIES , JUDGEMENTS The Broadcasting Complaints Commission was set up as part of the 1981 Broadcasting Act . It had been preceded for some years by BBC and IBA internal formal complaints procedures . But , as with the early police complaints procedures , public disquiet continued over how impartial a procedure could be when it was run and presided over by the colleagues of those accused . The majority of broadcasters are horrified at the potential scope of the BCC and by its intellectual and even emotional separation of ' understanding ' from their daily problems . They seek ? and see ? constant references in the complaints with which it deals evidence that it is extending its brief to embrace their daily progamme making . In broadcast management some fear it will become more and more prescriptive . With events of late 1988 these fears have been realised : prescription is joined by active proscription and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being eroded . Of particular worry has been the number of attempts by the National Front ( one partially successful ) to get complaints heard by the Commission . There is concern too among producers at the number of complainants who have appeared in investigative // programmes , and the possible effect this may have on nervous broadcasting executives . The BCC is limited in scope , however , in one vital area . It can only deal with complaints from the public where individuals or organisations have been directly involved in a programme . Mrs Whitehouse , in short , may complain that a programme dealing with her organisation treated it or her unfairly ; she can not complain specifically or generally to the BCC that broadcasts are getting more violent , or ruder . Legally , the BCC was set up to consider and adjudicate upon complaints of unjust or unfair treatment in sound or television programmes actually broadcast by the BBC and the IBA on or after 1st June , 1981 ; or of unwarranted infringement of privacy in , or in connection with the obtaining of material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such sound and television programmes , including advertisements and teletext transmissions and programmes broadcast by the BBC 's External Services ' . In the first year of operation of the BCC 114 complaints were received ; 91 were deemed outside the BCC 's jurisdiction . In the next year ( 1982 ? 83 ) they received 243 complaints , of which 188 fell outside their jurisdiction . In 1982 ? 3 the Commission dealt with 30 out of a possible 52 , some being left over from the year before ; nine were subject to full adjudications and another 21 were , basically , not dealt with . Of the nine , three were upheld , six dismissed . The Commission 's Annual Report suggested that the BCC was concerned in all these cases ( as also with those it did not eventually deal with ) at a lack of care by broadcasters over editing , editorialising and a failure to keep contributors aware of the way a programme was developing . Broadcasters , seeing such comments , worry even more that the BCC is straying from its strict legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogative of programme making . What , they might legitimately ask , do BCC members know about editorialising ? This debate is in the heartland of formal accountability . It spreads out into less formal areas because the public , although not necessarily knowing the technical terms of debate , are increasingly and dangerously conscious of how a programme can be altered by technical means . The word which people at large use to describe such means is distortion . From the broadcasters ' side this can appear to be ignorance of the problems they face in getting a programme on air . But bodies like the BCC and the Press Council will continue to attract professional brickbats while they remain in the shadowy // uncertainties of just what constitutes a profession , or professional practice . Broadcasters do themselves harm when they fail to define this adequately , or retreat into jargon . Both the BCC and the Press Council ( with much weaker powers ) run the same gauntlet from professional journalists in many pronouncements . The BCC is still feeling its way across very tricky ground . Needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this task . The public has a right to protection from the excesses of over-enthusiastic programme makers . Broadcasting is big business . All too often it has trodden over-heavily on the sensibilities of those it exposes ? and few so exposed have much idea in advance of what the public gaze can do to private lives . The BCC is a blunderbuss but it is at least a warning to the wilder parts of broadcasting . On the negative side it can be and is used by fringe groups to try to push a cause . The positive side is that some of the public at least seem to realise that the Commission exists and that they might be able to use it . The limitations to its powers are probably set at about the right level . Were its jurisdiction to be extended to anyone who had a complaint against what they saw or heard , it would have to be a very large organisation indeed and its myriad judgements would fail to have much impact . But practical accountability on a day-to-day basis remains ? and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be instructed in the ways in which they should operate to remain professional . Bodies like the BBC have been set up both because of public disquiet over broadcasting 's often perceived insensitivity , and politicians ' perceptions that to curb broadcasting may be popular . Until broadcasters can bring themselves to exercise sanctions against their own through fully accredited professional associations , much as medics or lawyers do , then it is arguable whether they can assume the mantle of a distinct profession . Many of those same broadcasters would argue that they have no desire to emulate either doctors or lawyers , that what they do ? in the public interest ? has to be protected as far as possible from the encroachments of committees , however well intentioned . The exercise of professional judgement by broadcasters is always going to be a tricky thing to pin down . We are in the field of art more than science here and art is notoriously a matter of taste . This would apply most of all to the newly-proposed watchdog for violent and sexually-explicit content in broadcasting , the Broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this nature has // been on the agenda for many years . The events of the late summer of 1987 in Hungerford when a lone gunman killed 15 people and then himself , simply crystallised public and private fears . It was symptomatic that broadcasters made no attempt to point out how weak , if existent at all , were the links between content of programmes and audience behaviour . In a classic moral panic ' emotion and sentiment finally won . The capitulation of the BBC in particular , was total , with a number of senior BBC managers making fools of themselves on air in the immediate aftermath of the killings . For a moment it seemed as if reason itself was suspended , while outraged public opinion sought atavistically for any target . Television was the obvious answer , and responded with the required mea cu/pa . It will take time to see if this further intrusion into broadcast freedom will serve any useful purpose ; inevitably it has affected programmes and altered the broadcasting climate such that the kind of artistic iconoclasm British television had sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hungerford may well turn out to be British broadcasting 's last stand in the long-running fight to preserve and maintain itself as the world 's leader in broadcast drama ? if that in part means the ability to challenge the cosy assumptions of mediocre middle-town. 4 Making Programmes ' ... there are two jobs worth having in the BBC : Director-General or producer . ' ( BBC programme-maker ) To concentrate on producers , as this chapter does . is not to deny or denigrate the many tasks , the many roles and parts played by the army of people who go to make up broadcast productions . But as the quotation which starts this discussion highlights , the role of producer is perceived by most broadcasters as the critical one . There arc curiosities about it , singularities which we have to explore before we can address the questions surrounding public accountability ( and producer responsibilities ) . Anthony Smith in a paper prepared for the Annan Committee , ' The relationship of Management with Creative Staff ' ( 1977 ) says that in the UK the British producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , with his status in France ) . Part of the problem , says Smith , is the distinction to be made between directors and producers ? not least in management/union agreements . ' The agreement between the ITV companies and the ACTT does not refer to producers at all ... ' . In the BBC , meanwhile , ... there are various grades of producer , all of whom may need but not involve deploying a directing skill ; the Editor , the most senior of these , tends to merge his function with that of head of department ... The result is that in Britain the producer is placed far closer to management ( and the management tends to have far more collective experience in production itself ) . . . ( than in foreign systems ) .. . Smith concludes that the producer is a ' creative official , as well as a creative professional ' . This has its rewards as well as its dangers and both are exemplified within British broadcasting . It means that producers are able to exercise more judgement ( within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it also means their decisions are informed by particular cultures of assimilation to broadcasting 's own ideas of itself at any time . Much of the mystery which surrounds production in the UK may be explained here . Producers themselves often claim they do not 50 // understand what it is they do . As the socialisation which takes them into the role of producer is often subtle and long-term their response is not unreasonable . The danger is that this process of creative assessment becomes one of self-justification for either arrogant indifference to audiences or a crippling ( because irrational ) selfcensorship . Producers vary in what they do . the job of a radio producer being different from that of a television producer , for instance . Just as a television producer making drama programmes will do a very different job to one making documentaries . They also vary enormously in their attitudes but there is a containment of those attitudes within the framework created by , say , the BBC ? its past , its present and , in the sense that all current work is future-directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular ethos depending on where they work within broadcasting . Specialisms abound , the extreme perhaps being areas like natural history , or drama . Assessing what to produce can be very hard : A lot of the time you are dropping stones down a deep well and hoping to hear the echo . I listen to my next door neighbour or what people think in the pub . I am quite often thrown by the response I get . ( Drama producer ) There are also differences of approach between the BBC and ITV companies , and Channel Four , in the ways they deploy their production staff , but the similarities override any of these . British broadcasting has become more , not less , seamless over time . The annual national and international awards ceremonies are testimony enough to the parallelism of BBC and ITV production . Within the BBC there is a tension that is different : the one occasioned by size ; the creative professional may feel he or she is at odds with a sprawling bureaucracy . As BBC broadcasting has grown it has divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The BBC came to pass silently , invisibly ; like a coral reef , cells busily multiplying , until it was a vast structure , a conglomeration of studios , offices , cool passages along which many passed . ' C. S. Lewis ( quoted by Smith , 1973 ) suggests it was , briefly , a democracy before its early ideals were swallowed up in Reith 's ( and others ' ) gloomy determination that broadcasting must serve virtue and virtue alone . First , we should not forget , there were engineers ; then there was a // nascent bureaucracy ; then programme-makers . And if this seems to be a harsh judgement the record betokens it . The script they followed was mostly written after the event : in the early days broadcasting was very ad hoc , mostly ad lib . Rapidly , because the medium was perceived to be a crucial element in a modern state , another script came to be written so that now it is almost impossible not to believe in the rightness of the way broadcasters do their daily tasks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted , too often , from the primary purposes set out by programme-makers . It may well be that the final judgement of history is that it is a trivial pursuit , given too much weight in the councils of the wise , a bauble and not a crystal ball . But programme-making is one agreed purpose , not politics or economics or social change . All those latter three have bedevilled broadcasting and those who operate its parts . The BBC , as the national instrument of broadcasting ' has been most vulnerable to delusions of grandeur . It has become so good at playing this game that outsiders can believe the game is reality . But as one perceptive observer had it in 1986 , what BBC officials , executives , senior staff , all have in common is an ability to seem connected ' , rather more than they are . It took a series of financial and political hiccups to convince it , corporately , that in the 1980s its only hope lay in a revival of what it did best : programme-making . Yet , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director-General in 1985 , the emphasis on programmes was a cynical ratings-chase all over again . At that too , arguably , the BBC was best . The key to programme-making lies with the producer . He ( still unusually she although the balance is changing ) is the programme in its early stages , the sole repository , in many cases , of what a programme may become . The role often combines in one person the authority for the direction a programme will probably take . It is a job much misunderstood outside broadcasting precisely because it covers so many possibilities . That , among other things , is why people love the work : it creates scope for enormous freedom . This , however , is within the learned constraints of the organisation . There are two other curbs : the first financial , the second institutional , for despite there being , certainly in the BBC , a belief and acceptance of internalised norms , there is a large administrative net . Wedell ( 1968 ) points out that the tension this induces is neither new nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comment , ten years on , by the Annan Committee that , again discussing the BBC , what Making Programmes 53 I differentiates the BBC from normal industry is that it is producing thousands of one-off jobs , each of them unique ' . This may exaggerate , but not much . Programmes , even within a series , have their special individual characteristics and their unique problems . It is the diversity of output in and between programmes which determines the need for particular kinds of people to produce . Too much can be made of this but , within the older BBC , the ability of the organisation to pick these brilliant young men and women was , a legend . The trouble has in part been that the BBC still believes it picks them although , as with any other large establishment , the mediocre both get in and survive , often to an astonishing extent . On the whole they are middle class , university-educated , neither of which categories should surprise : their social composition reflects , and is reflected in , the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Channel Four is no exception to this : indeed ? possibly because of its small size ? the middle-class self-righteousness of its corporate view is what strikes an observer so forcibly . Moreover Channel Four has capitalised on the notion that somehow its programmes are not made in the same way as the BBC 's . By and large , of course , they are . Although Channel Four uses a number of independent producers , nearly all of them are fully-trained professionals ; a high proportion in the beginning , in fact , ex-BBC . Channel Four at no stage hands over anything like editorial control . Indeed , where well-used production companies are involved , whenever a serious problem over content arises , Channel Four snatches back whatever loosening of the reins had been applied . An important example of this occurred in 1986 over a programme made by Diverse Productions attacking the IBA , Channel Four 's legal parent . The commissioning editor banned the original showing saying that the programme was unbalanced ' , ironically the classic reason given for such actions by the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from socio-cultural centrism ( to use an ugly neologism ) which constitutes the middle ground of opinion . Not for one moment does this imply that any single producer might not be extreme in his or her views , left or right . But it does imply that overall there has been an effort at institutional balance and impartiality . The accepted master of this process is the BBC . The BBC has of late chosen this ground on which to stand and fight . The inability to perceive its shifting or undermining nature is attributable to any number of causes , many of which are // explored in this book . The sincerity and necessity of the stand are not in doubt . Yet by the mid-1980s it was the very existence of this consensual centre which was challenged ? by the two main political parties and , apparently , by the behaviour of people in the streets and in the voting booths . The vain efforts of the SDP-Liberal Alliance , not to break the mould but to re-form it , teetered on the edge of success , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into political controversy , as I have already argued , by simply being there . Krishan Kumar ( 1977 ) has developed this ' middle ground ' theme at some length . The thrust of his argument is that holding it constitutes the parameters of a very narrow debate about what is ' good ' broadcasting . Kumar is discussing presentation , primarily , but his words apply with some force to the whole set of processes which make up programme-making . He believes that this position taken by the BBC , which it holds with increasing difficulty , stems from a consideration of the precarious nature of its institutional position . As it has been so often caught up in controversy it has maintained an institutional balance by insisting that it is , indeed , in the middle of any particular argument . The emphasis on professionalism , with its overtones of what amount to an academic detachment , has enabled the BBC to present a public face of dispassionate aloofness . It is this persona that can so infuriate the non-broadcaster as its manifestation can all too often appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' new ' BBC ? the BBC of the ' shareholder ' , and of the populist programming face . Many ? most ? broadcasters believe they are ' professionals ' . As with the debate in journalism at large , there is a dispute over the meaning of this term ? if indeed it has one meaning . In broadcasting there is to begin with a separation of ' professions ' between the engineers and the programme producers . There is also a separation between the craft areas , including lighting , props , cameramen ; and the research , direction and producing fronts . Again , younger broadcasters would reject the term ' professional ' , seeing in it an implication of precisely that detached aloofness which they desire to break down , between themselves and their audiences . Richard Hoggart , writing 20 years ago in The Listener said ' clearly professionalism has to be better defined by the broadcasters themselves so that internal criticism improves ; and criticism from outside needs to be much more informed , responsive and varied ' . Broadcasters mean very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . To journalists it can mean careful factual checking against a very tight deadline ; getting a story across at all costs ; being cool under ( sometimes real ) fire . To drama it can mean authenticity ; to current affairs balance of argument or , where appropriate , advocacy . The professional , in the last case , knows when to advocate , when not . Producers are proud of their knowledge concerning their audiences ; there is considerable evidence to show that the majority know less than they think they do ( see Chapter 5 ) . What they think of as audience preference comes , more often than not , from a reading of letters , possibly from phone calls and from the ubiquitously mentioned man in the pub : The main thing is living in open societies . When I go to parties I do n't meet 17 broadcasters , four journalists and half a dozen actresses . My circle is headmaster , computer man , restaurateur , greengrocer . . . I am not willing to say ' yes sir ' , ' no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it that it does come back to your instinct for professionalism . Your accountability to your own conscience . The BBC is blessed by a high number of people who care . ( Senior BBC producer ) Burns ( 1977 ) points out that the word ' professional ' has ' extraordinary wide currency in the Corporation . In context of programme production , and of the BBC 's relationship with its audiences , it seems to have three separable , though not distinct , meanings ' . These are : 1 I ) The opposite of amateur ; ( 2 ) Qualified by long specialised training ; ( 3 ) Indicating a code of behaviour related to the ' client ' . But , Burns says , the client is rarely thought to be the audience but the programme-maker 's superior . He suggests that the insistence of professionalism , at one level , is the need for self-protection , or to shelve consideration of the implications of a mass audience possibly running into tens of millions . Producers do produce for their superiors who , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also produce for each other 's approval . But it would be grossly unfair to suggest that they do not have any conception of a mass audience . The problem is to reduce its enormity to human size . Letters , phone calls , the man in the pub , are all ways of doing just that . ( To put the problem into some perspective , a 1986 Saturday children 's show received in one run over five million letters . ) Burns ' study , the fieldwork for which was done twenty years ago , // describes a BBC much more certain of what it was ; even he draws out the neuroses of change , of unfulfilled purpose . Part of those neuroses even then were related to size . Part were related to a realisation that broadcasting was potent , although few then ( or now ) would have cared to indicate how the brew could be reduced to rational analysis . Producers , although less obviously than actors or presenters or the so-called ' personalities ' , have an image attached to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so have all broadcaster personnel . The public has become used to the acclamation , through the Press , of broadcasting as part of the twentieth century 's Roman Games . Broader political , economic and social circumstances are lending weight to the broadcasting managers who wish to get the public more inside the system . For the BBC this is primarily defensive ? ensuring that people understand what they pay the licence fee for . In commercial broadcasting , including Channel Four , it is good business to allow the audience to join in ? up to a point . Accessibility , if not accountability , is marketing policy . The processes of history at large are determining that the public will wish to know more and more about broadcasting . How much more is a matter for fierce internal argument . Keeping the mystery alive is a strong argument ( as it is with theatre and special effects in film ) . But the clamour of the times is for more knowledge , not less , at whatever price . Programme-makers also inhabit a world where they are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own heads of department to be , in one sense or another , accountable . Their responses are highly differential , largely dependent on their proximity to the audience , and on their institutional position . Thus , on the broadest possible scale , radio programme-makers are more likely to respond , and respond quickly , to audience pressures than are television programme-makers . But within radio there are great differences . Radio Three , whilst retaining a generally good relationship with its tiny audience , does not pride itself exactly on ' responding ' . The relationship is at best teacher ? pupil . Radio Four , not least because it produces programmes like ' Feedback ' , is better . On this scale BBC local radio is likely to be best . The level of response is also related ? although not necessarily cynically ? to self-interest . Radio is much more competitive than television ; and is indeed in competition with television . Radio audiences have already begun to fragment , especially in the evenings . In television the two classically remote areas are drama and light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , just observational surmise . Programme-makers clearly have an overriding need to be free from insistent pressure from audiences to do this or that ; the standard defence by programme-makers on not responding is that it would take far too much time . Additionally most would say that the purpose of their employment in broadcasting is to make ' professional ' judgements about what audiences need ' ; or to put that another way , and to reiterate Reith , ' few people know what they want , fewer what they need ' . This is not to suggest that programme-makers can or do operate in a vacuum ; they are extremely good at assessing public desires and public needs . As television programmes and the more elaborate radio series take up to two years to pass from idea to finished product , second-guessing the future is a highly developed art . The output shows programmemakers as quite often uncannily accurate sooth-sayers , scheduling programmes ? and not just long-planned documentaries ? just as a news event covering the same topic breaks . Sometimes they are too good , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mirror an unpleasant and immediate reality . Programmes dealing with the growing nuclear threat , and with the NATO and Warsaw Pact windows of opportunity ' were made years before the Reagan ? Gorbachev summit . The Real Lives programme At the Edge of the Union ' , shown at last in the autumn of 1985 , pre-dated by just a few weeks the Anglo-Irish Agreement and showed the kind of bigotry and extremism in human terms that the Accord is supposed to circumvent . There are many other examples . Producers and many of those assistants , researchers , secretaries , inside broadcasting read ' the world intensely for signs of what will he , as well as what is , and what has been . Mis-reading does occur . Although programmes can be close to audience concerns , and in current affairs this can be more easily done than in , say drama , many can seem irrelevant . Given that programmes can cost huge sums of money , and given that once a commitment has been made a programme will generally roll on its way , untrammelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ) , the chances of being transmitted are nearly total . Whether an audience at that time wants that programme is another matter . Part of this mis-reading of audiences ? and it is hard to know how often it happens ? is because programme-makers are , by and large , poor users of the tools they have available : principal among these is audience research ( see Chapter 6 ) . There is a strong tendency // to read audience research data for the good news , not the had . Programme-makers thus become obsessed by the raw number of total watchers or listeners and by what are known as Als ( Audience Appreciation Indices ) . The latter is a sophisticated and well-tested attempt to give more information than simply how many watched or listened . Thus it is professionally acceptable that many science programmes will not get mass audiences ; they ought , however , to get good AIs , providing that those who chose to watch or listen did so with enjoyment . Programme-makers rarely get beyond this point . But they can , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believe it ought , indulge in one or more behaviours . The first is to look at what was running against it on the other channels . It may be true that a strong programme on the other channel can take away ratings points ; it would not affect Als of course . But schedulers are trying to set strong against strong , weak against weak so the validity of this excuse is always dubious . Second , and frequent , is the denigration of audience research and its personnel . Until recently in the BBC this was common and had a certain force because of the idiosyncratic nature of parts of the BBC Audience Research Department . Since the unified system of BARB ( Broadcasters Audience Research Board ) this has not been so acceptable a defence ? although it is still tried . Curiously , those ex-programme-makers , heads of department , controllers and above , also indulge in knocking the audience research they expensively commission , sometimes publicly . The result is that some programme-makers have a very poor view of audience research and an even poorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example in pre-testing programmes or programme ideas . There are honourable exceptions , chiefly in educational broadcasting , where different arrangements between broadcasters and part of their audience ( teachers ) ensure that much more thought goes into programme planning . The older attitudes are changing under growing pressures . More and more producers are turning to the battery of methods now available at not much cost to give them some idea of what their audience both wants and is capable of absorbing within one programme . Needless to say science , health and continuing education are in the van of this movement . But the That 's Life production team made changes to its style after audience reaction testing by BBC audience research staff , as did the BBC news . // One problem for producers is suspension of disbelief in test results , especially if they appear to fly in the face of received wisdom built up over years . If a programme works , goes this argument , leave it alone . Poking into audiences ' motives might lead to a failure to innovate , to he brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen or heard it . Would Monty Python or Not the Nine O'Clock News ever have been transmitted if the public had been asked in advance about its views ? But programme-makers will point to statistical inconsistencies ; others will lament the times when having two sets of tigures ( in the pre-BARB days ; sometimes contradictory because they used different methods ) at least meant you could legitimately challenge those which were least favourable to yourself ? or dismiss them both because neither agreed . Tracey ( 1978 ) has argued , using political programme producers as a sample group , that producers have in truth no interest in the audience at all : ' the manifestation is of a relatively closed world festooned with a number of vaguely formulated but unsubstantiated assumptions about the audience ' . This is too harsh . Producers manifesting that degree of cynicism or indifference in their output would not last long . It is encouraging indeed to witness precisely the opposite . But the dilemma remains the organisation of an essentially creative activity within a framework set by a dangerous mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to he as well a ' correct ' level of assessment of audience requirements which should in no way interfere with the exercise of critical judgements . Inevitably these judgements will often appear to be prescriptive . Audiences of course matter . But they are not a homogeneous mass making demands . Over the years they have been extraordinarily tolerant as programme-making has grown from its infancy . Their collective sophistication is now immense and programmes are made which simply could not have been ' read ' correctly a few years ago . l Inquestionably the pressures on programme-makers have been growing . Since the 1960s these pressures have taken a number of forms : Financial ; Institutional ; ' Professional ' ; Political ; Social ; Audience . Financial Pressure The major problem for programme-makers has been costs . Broadcasting , radio or television , has been explosively expensive . Although // many radio programmes have tiny budgets ( a few hundred pounds , other than staff costs ) , and many television programmes are also relatively cheap ( a few thousand an hour ) . many are hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was costing around ? 250000 ; ITV drama was thought to be at least 50 per cent more . The trade unions were continuing to milk broadcasting dry . They operated many practices similar to ( if not borrowed from ) national newspapers . The attitude was that television , especially , could afford to pay through the nose . For the BBC , although it had traded on its position in the national culture to persuade many staff it was worth working for despite lower rates of pay , this was all potentially fatal . The BBC , whose accounting system had been built over many years , and which many observers thought to be quaint , was not overly profligate ; neither was its real spending so far out of line with other organisations of its size . Its central problem was its income , fixed as it was so tightly to the licence fee . There were many areas where spending could have been controlled more tightly . But producers and programme-makers at large feared that the easiest to cut were future programme commitments because they involved paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly to counter these fears that the Director-General 's office issued a statement in 1985 that the BBC was still committed to programmemaking as a first priority . Institutional Pressure At the same time , and partly as a response to growing financial pressures , programme-makers have been under greater management controls . The BBC has operated a system of ' reference up ' for its producers which at its best creates the room for them to make the programmes they want , subject to the constraints already discussed . This policy , which was laid down by the Board of Governors , is designed to ensure that producers are free , but keep the obligation to refer to their line manager any policy issue they can not resolve . Of course this helps reinforce a ' middle ground ' culture . In the climate of increasing pressure upon the top management of the BBC from outside , it may result in a kind of institutional abuse . While there are large numbers of ' case law ' directives and ' guidelines ' coming down the line from senior management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above in reporting problems , but an obligation to protect their nascent programme from senior interference . // Within the BBC there is a feeling that on certain questions ( and Northern Ireland is the most prominent ) the multiplication of ' guidelines ' and imprimaturs now informing any attempt to make programmes in these areas , will lead to a form of indirect censorship . This takes the form of ' good idea , but not just now . Part of this , and equally serious . has been the institution 's own growing caution , horn of the twin fears that it will upset Government and/or its audiences . In the words of one senior producer ' it dies the thousand deaths of the coward ' . In Channel Four the pressures also exist : first , the company operates a fierce accounting system which gives commissioned producers very little room to manoeuvre . Second , there is a form of ideological coercion , subtle but ever-present , which tends to give programmes a sameness of outlook . This ' oppositionalism ' , a form of radical liberalism without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anything the BBC can muster against its own programme-makers . If a judgement is to be made it is that programme-makers in the BBC are still much freer than programmemakers working for Channel Four ; but that in the BBC those freedoms are constantly under attack . In Channel Four the freedoms available to the commissioning editors have not begun to emerge as any kind of a potential problem . Professional Pressure The simplest to explain but the hardest to pin down , this pressure stems from the best side of British broadcasting which is its commitment to excellence . Over the years the standards of programmes , taken overall , has improved immeasurably . But the immediate effect is that all programme-makers are looking over their shoulders to see how they may increase what might be called the ' slickness ' factor . In high quality drama this may be laudable but where it is applied to a radio station output or to the Community Programme Unit it is less so . There is , contained within this desire to he seen to be making better and better programmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole structure . This is the awards syndrome , itself encouraged by managements anxious throughout broadcasting to ' prove ' that excellence is alive and encouraged here . The number and classes of broadcasting awards , both national and international , have been steadily growing as broadcasting itself has grown . Traditionally the BBC have always // scooped the pool . Since the 1970s , with increasing financial pressures and , perhaps more importantly , lessening organisational will , the BBC had been gaining proportionately less and less awards each year . Suddenly , in 1986 , the BBC nearly swept the board . There were good programmes but the suspicion remains that award panels , anxious to help the BBC at a time when it was under fierce attack , and when the Peacock Committee had not yet reported , were tilting the balance a little to prop it up . The pressure remains ? if anything it grows in proportion to the relative lack of success . The coming of Channel Four , with its innovative approaches , has made the situation much worse for the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their audiences , who probably care little for whether a particular programme wins an award or not . The running of the annual BAFTA awards ceremony , among others , live or semi-live on television , is of dubious interest outside the industry . Political Pressure Political pressure there has always been : its increase on programmemakers comes from a growing recognition by the political system that broadcasting may have great social purpose . Although it would be wrong to suggest that such pressure exists on all programmemakers at all times , equally it would be wrong not to recognise its presence in current affairs , news and , perhaps surprisingly , in drama . Drama programmes throw into sharp relief many of the political questions of the day . Almost by definition drama playwrights tend to be oppositional , radical , often overtly left-wing . Their output is meant to stimulate viewers and listeners ; their eyes and ears bring the uncomfortable into focus . ' Tumbledown ' , transmitted in 1988 , demonstrates this desire in drama , to think the uncomfortable , to force audiences to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very rare . But retrospective pressure there is : a programme is broadcast , is roundly condemned ; next time the programme-makers , aware of what happened last time , may exercise more caution ; if they do not their immediate bosses may do so on their behalf . To call this process self-censorship is too strong but it is constantly there . It is my view that the BBC has become more timid ; that some of the dramas , for instance , that it might have shown in the 1970s would no longer be acceptable . Part of the existing threat to the BBC is that companies like Central now make plays like ' Made // in Britain ' and that they are prepared to run them in peak time . The argument in reverse is that without the BBC as a model such plays would not be made by commercial television ; again , perhaps , the BBC re-took the lead in this field by showing two Alan Clarke plays early in 1989 , Elephant ' and The Firm ' . Social Pressure Programme-makers have become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was always true that a large part of the output took consideration of the world and its problems : broadcasters as a group have always espoused a very public social conscience . Since the late 1960s there has been growth of another related pressure on programme-makers ; it is to understand the medium in which they work ; and as a concomitant of that to recognise its limitations and its inherent if not fully understood ability to change attitudes . The issue of the power of broadcasting , and of television in particular , lies outside the remit of this book . Nevertheless broadcasters have become more and more aware of the dangers associated with their chosen form . Equally they have begun to recognise the limitations of content . Television has a certain shortsightedness : it purveys crude broad-brush emotions , not finely-tuned argument . It is long on spectacle , short on specifics ; extremely powerful when conveying a simple idea , weakest when attempting a subtle philosophy . On the other hand radio does lend force to the imagination and it has increasingly been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of television , its immense power to inform a worldwide audience , the technology and who controls it , all come back to the programmemakers ' door . Audience Pressure Finally then , to audiences and the completion of the circle . Audiences do exert pressures . As we have seen these may stem from the ratings ; they may stem from physical contact . Most ephemeral of all but in the long term among the most telling , the pressure may come from that very antenna-like sensitivity a programme-maker has of what audiences demand , or may like to hear and see in the coming months and years . // Part of this sensitivity is derived from a number of quite well established and formal mechanisms designed to gather intelligence . They have , in the main , a secondary ( and recent ) overlay of formal accountability placed on them . Part of their primary purpose has always been defence of the programme-maker against the cruder forms of public pressure , and a means for the programme-maker to respond to that public through post hoc knowledge of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more recent developments , not yet much used by programme-makers , some because they mistrust its source , others because they do not know it exists , is projective testing : asking an audience sample what kind of programmes it might like dealing with a subject ; how they should be organised ; what contents they should have ; and who ought to present them . Meanwhile programme-makers muddle on , the security of their belief in their profession under attack as the public is exposed to more and more broadcasting . It is the greatly under-estimated expertise of that huge audience that broadcasting research has been at pains to tap , all in the name of better programmes . Producers and their assistants are not the only creative staff who count , of course , but they do exercise an enormous influence over all broadcast programmes . They are among the most privileged people to work in British broadcasting and most of them know it . They are the front line of programme-making and it is on their continuing commitment to making the best programmes they can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospers . But it is the case that that commitment is not wholly audiencedirected . It has , as we have seen , many dimensions . The question here is not dissimilar from most consumer goods . Buyers there too have little initial choice when it comes to deciding what should he made available . Subsequently people may or may not choose to buy and thus a market-place which responds to some form of demand begins to function . Broadcasting is not so different , despite its artistic pretensions ? but then neither is fine art . The more interesting questions then , is not whether audiences count with the makers of broadcasting but whether they are seriously considered as consumers in the active or passive sense . To understand that , programme-makers would have to look much more closely at the mass of research data // already extant which tells us a great deal about audiences and how they behave . On the whole neither programme-makers nor broadcastexecutives bother . Their surprise when their own researchers tell them about the real ' audience out there is manifest ? and revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences for broadcasting ? Read on ... 5 The audience is out there What do you think of ' it so far ? A paradox of broadcasting is that while audiences have been much studied , and British audiences top the league table for breadth and depth of studies , the largest amount of all this effort is devoted to answering the least interesting question . That is how many people are watching what at a particular time . More interesting questions , why people watch or listen when they do ; how people make their choices ; and what they make of what they watch or listen to , although asked of samples , are analysed poorly . Of late these questions have come to be recognised as the truly serious ones about broadcasting if we are to have any understanding of what it is that audiences want from broadcasting in an age of proliferating choice . What is clear is that one way or another audiences are fascinated by broadcasting . This began with radio , reaching a crescendo in the late 1930s , peaking again perhaps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Television displaced some but by no means all of that simple worship . Today it is possible to discern that the mass audience , while loving ' some of its television personalities , may also have a much better understanding of what that relationship is and of the clay feet of those worshipped . This intimacy with broadcasting and broadcasters is exploited through devices like the television personality ? constructs not dissimilar to , but far more potent than the older Hollywood stars . Individual members of the mass audience do identify considerably with , for example , soap opera characters . The perception by the audience of soap opera characters is probably one of realism ? that is , they believe in them and in their real ' existence . The relationship deserves more research . One such exploration was in Dorothy Hobson 's pioneering work on Crossroads , ATV 's ( now Central ) long-running serial ? now defunct ? about a Midlands motel . Hobson discovered that her sample of the very large audience for this programme did have a close identity with its characters although there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while accepting the fictional conventions of the television soap opera , nonetheless were able to create a sense in which those fictional portrayals became part of their intimate lives . In some ways the very 66 // crassness , the stereotypical , cliched poverty of dramatic art or even artifice in such soaps gives them an added verissimilitude : after all , how many ' real ' people talk the way a Pinter character , or even an Iris Murdoch hero , does ? This point about audience choice and attitudes touches upon another significant problem about those who produce and manage broadcasting , and those for whom it is intended . It is still the case that in the late 1980s the vast majority of those connected with broadcasting have middle-class backgrounds and tastes ; along with an often highly developed sense of ' art ' . Television ? and some radio , i.e. network BBC Radios Three and Four . are bedevilled by a covert struggle between rank populism and high culture . There is perhaps only a hint but it is there , of a secret snobbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the overt debate within television ? both BBC and commercial ? of late has been between those who see the possibility at least of television as art and those who see it effectively as commerce ( as in buying and selling audiences to advertisers ) . Audiences are hardly noticed at one level in this argument , although of course they are targets for both groups . The terms of the debate ? although its rancour excludes the word more often than not ? are the old ones : giving the people what they want , or trying to lead them on to better things ( as defined by the providers ) . At one extreme the argument leads to a view that all television ( usually the prime target ) is had for us and should be banned . Jerry Mander 's Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television sits at one end ; much more serious a proposition ( that television destroys ' true ' culture ) is put foward by Neil Postman 's Amusing Ourselves to Death . Both these authors concentrate exclusively on the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very different . Well , so they are , but not that different . And indeed one so far unsullied principal of European ? especially British ? mass media is what happens in the US today will inexorably happen to us tomorrow , in however attentuated a form . Postman is a cogent thinker and his central thesis is that we have embraced that part of Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World which suggested that the tyranny of the future would not be imposed from above but absorbed from below . The new slavery would be self-inflicted . Postman says so it is , and that it is all done through television which has progressively reduced all debate , all discourse , // all meaning , to entertainment . Show business , he says , is what television does best ? possibly the only thing it can do ? and the result is the loss ( if I read him right ) of the pain of learning , cured by the new panacea of the tube . Many would agree with this analysis . Yet it flies in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience responses to broadcasting , as opposed to the responses of the elite : politicians , educationalists , theologians , sociologists , journalists and moralists at large . The subject of audience attitudes to broadcasting is entirely a fascinating one . There are strong grounds for believing there is a quasi-religious element ; a kinship with the Royal Family perhaps , in the UK , with all the overtones of mysticism that relationship entails along with its equally religious overtones . It is worth noting that in the latter case , too , clay feet are an inevitable part of the continuing story , and that the Royals have recognised , if not exactly welcomed , their soap opera alter egos . What we have then from audiences , is a complex set of attitudes directed at the others ' as portrayed on screen and via the radio set . Certainly the latter ( radio ) pulls its audiences in this way . The mid-1980s ' surprising rediscovery by Radio Four listeners of The Archers is a good case . What motivates more and more people to start to tune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet The Archers has become a vogue again . Broadcasters would argue , with some justification , that this new interest develops in small ways ? out of casual conversations in pubs and work-places ? which accumulate in a hyperbolic audience curve like the spread of a rumour or of smoke through a building . They can not so easily answer at what point this happens , or why . Script changes help . The Archers is part of a long radio cultural heritage . It has the advantage of being familiar , yet it is changing . Sex helps too : the injection of more of that magic ingredient ( Brian 's affair with Caroline ; Shula 's marriage to Mark ; Sophie 's , now Ruth 's , innocence to be snatched by David ) has undoubtedly boosted flagging ratings . Old listeners die away , possibly disgusted ? at least irritated ? at these changes ; new ones arrive and , like all mass media , the programme achieves that inevitable but vital revamping it has to have in order to keep going . Many other programmes do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis that once you find a formula that works kick it to death over many years . I Love Lucy , Highway Patrol , MASH , Starsky and Hutch , Kojak are a few examples in thousands . // The problem , of course , is that broadcasting was borne on the wings of art , and of life through the news . It has never quite sorted out the punctuation between its music hall insouciance and its serious purpose and the two functions have often been confused . Thus the BBC , the more serious in intent if not in realisation , has pushed its news service towards the stage : the Nine O'Clock News is in presentation much less serious than it once was ; on The World at One ( Radio Four ) in the mid 1980s , the Christmas schedules for BBC radio were solemnly read out as news ' . Other broadcasters commit other but equal sins . THEORIES There is no shortage of theories of audience behaviour , based , as many are , on extensive study of the mass audience and all its sub-cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial laboratory environments , most notably the mass of psychological research concerned with the effects of violence . Other research has relied on recall ? not just of what was listened to or seen , but how respondents felt while they were engaged in watching or listening . A considerable research effort has been put into defining the possible framework ( or , for Tracey ( 1978 ) its absence ) between programme-maker and audience : how , in short , does the programmemaker figure out who his or her construct is for ? McQuail ( 1969 ) , addressing this question falls back on G. H. Mead : a community that has no common interest , no co-operative activity , is one in which you could not communicate . . . The process of communication can not be set up as something that exists by itself . . . the social process is pre-supposed . ' As with many researchers before him , McQuail gets stuck on the question of how on earth the two parties do in fact communicate , other than in a purely formal sense . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of framework on the relationship . He says there are four ways of looking , formally , at audiences . First , they may be perceived ( and commonly are ) as an aggregate of spectators , readers , listeners , viewers . Second , they may be perceived as a mass . Third , they may he perceived as a public or social group and , finally , as a market . What McQuail is at pains to point out , following the uses and gratifications ' school , is that audience experiences are active , rather than passive . The evidence grows that audiences also have a social // relationship with mass media , rather than an isolating one . The missing link is between audiences and what might be called ' purposive ' activity . Although audiences ' think about the media . . . as if they could be useful . . . What is missing is extensive independent validation that much media use is prompted by consciously or unconsciously formed motives ' . Much of the official audience research data gets no further down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for watching or listening to a particular programme . Special projects in the BBC audience-research department have taken a deeper view but there is little exploration of the ' motives ' for using broadcasting . It is always possible that , as with motives in other aspects of living , these are not susceptible to other than impossibly expensive psychological ( and individual , tentative ) examination . PRACTICES The astonishing fact is that after all the research that has been done into audiences we still appear to know very little . It is as if each generation of broadcasters and broadcast researchers , facing the same problems as their predecessors , conspire tacitly to tear up the account so far and demand a new one . Every now and then , however , new insights creep in ; sometimes these have an impact out of all proportion to what they reveal . Peter Collett 's Oxford television study is one now well on the way to being a legendary project , although the data it produced are similar to those produced in the USA in the 1960s ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 homes and the way they ' watched ' television . The novelty of the approach , courtesy of modern technology , was to install a television camera in 20 modified television receivers so that the camera recorded what went on in the room when the television was switched on . In order to help the analysis the playback tape also recorded in real-time the programme being ' watched ' and a digital clock enabled a frame by frame analysis of the television picture set against the audience reaction . Apart from providing themselves and other researchers with years of material to analyse in any detail required , Collett 's own first results suggest that , as we might have suspected from our own behaviour , television ' viewing ' is as liable to distraction as is radio listening . People go on doing what they have always done in their homes before any broadcast media intruded. // They are of course brought back to the attention of the screen when given cues ? dramatic music , noisy advertisements , loud voices . These effects ' have been intuitively exploited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . The most significant point is that television programme makers are producing their work for viewing in a climate in which maybe a majority of people are only intermittently engaged with it . People are skimming through the hook ' glancing at the illustrations , rather than reading line by line . Collett points out in The Listener for 22 May 1986 that whereas the old methods of television audience measurement by means of diaries ( not strictly true , in fact ) were used extensively the results can now be seen to be widely inaccurate . Even the newer means using electronic keypads registering presence ' can only indicate just that ; attention to what is on the screen is simply not known . The Collett study fits well with a presentation given by the former head of the BBC 's Broadcasting Research Department 's Special Projects section , Pam Mills , at the 1985 Biennial Royal Television Society 's meeting in Cambridge . Mills called the paper Beyond Head Counting ' . It analysed audience data to indicate how people used their media in the home , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they watched . She dealt with the technology available , with the programme factors ( why they watched one thing rather than another ) and with the environment in which they were watching . Taking technology first : although some 40 per cent of homes now have a second set there is very little simultaneous use of both sets . On a July Saturday in London , for example , for every 100 hours of first-set viewing , there were 47 hours of second-set viewing . But 29 hours of this was at a different time . Of the 18 hours that were simultaneous 11 involved both sets tuned to the same channel . Only in seven hours was the second set used for choice . A quarter of the homes with second sets were tuned simultaneously to the same channel . In the then 30 per cent of homes with video cassette recorders ( the figure in 1988 was nearer 60 per cent ) these are mostly used for time-shifting rather than to watch pre-recorded tapes . Video ownership does not increase significantly the amount of time broadcast television is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those carefully worked-out sequences so exactly put together to tempt them to stay tuned . Other than their use of video recorders , audiences ' own watching // schedules depend on further factors : a prerequisite is that people are at home and wish to watch television , for example . Evidence suggests this is around the early evening , as schedulers assume . But it is also clear that few people have much more than a hazy idea of what might be on at any time , other than for a few punctuation ' points like the news . Most important for programme-makers , who are these people who may , as we have seen , not be really watching ' television much at all ? Many programme-makers assume that the audience for their programme is of a particular kind . Thus the producers of Panorama on BBC1 have for years believed that their audience is more middle class than that for Minder , on Thames . This is not the case . To take Panorama : in a six-week period in 1985 , when the average audience size was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class was 65 per cent ; this compares with 64 per cent of working-class people in Britain as a whole . This tendency is true of all television programmes ( although not of radio , where the choices made are different ) . Mills also looked at choice of programmes . She pointed out that little was known about how programmes are selected and ? as is still the case ? little about how they are viewed . These questions are important if more understanding is to be brought to the question of what it is that audiences gain from particular programme strands . This affects the debate about sex and violence , for example . Gunter ( 1985 ) has shown that perceptions of violence vary depending on who an audience is ; the tender-minded see more violence than the tough-minded , for instance . Audience definitions of what violence is also fluctuate . So , clearly , do their definitions of what they like . In the sixty years of broadcasting so far , our concepts of what constitutes an audience ' has changed radically . The increasing sophistication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one change . But others have come from the central points about the uses made of the mass media by audiences and their heterogeneity ; their differences not their similarities . AT THE SHARP END : WHAT DO AUDIENCES THINK ? In the time broadcasting has been available as a mass medium , and in part , undoubtedly , because of broadcasting , attitudes which once seemed certain have undergone great change . Radio was put before // people as a pre-selected diet by broadcasters who knew ' what was correct and what was not . Television , when it began in earnest as a mass medium in the 1950s , also had a strong sense of the correct way of approach . It operated in a self-imposed strait-jacket of conventions , many determined by an attitude of deference to authority . The result was that audiences responded to its factual output , in comparison with the clear-cut partisan Press , as if broadcast news was the truth . It has taken a more cynical if more realistic age to come to terms with the techniques by which current events are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of images , the editing , the words that are placed over those fleeting pictures to frame them with meaning . It used to be axiomatic that broadcasting was the most trusted medium for news , for instance . As television became the dominant medium in the 1960s it also became the case that television news was where the overwhelming majority of the national audience took its first intelligence in any day . News coverage and its impact on audiences has dominated much media research in universities and polytechnics over the past 15 years ; although the initial furore , over research like the Glasgow Media Group 's Bad News on television news bias , has mostly died down , the result has been that broadcasters have begun to worry somewhat more than they did before about what it is they are doing , and how the audience may perceive it . A study undertaken for the BBC in 1983 ( published the following year ) had disturbing things to tell broadcasters about news coverage and perceptions of it . Looking at the coverage in television news of three issues ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study found that although audiences still considered television to he the most accurate and detailed ( 41 per cent ; only 17 per cent thought the Press most accurate ) , a third thought television omitted important facts . Between a quarter and a half thought television should have shown more on each of these issues . Up to 46 per cent thought television sometimes deliberately misleading , compared with 38 per cent who thought it generally honest . This finding is in marked contrast to earlier research on audience perceptions of the integrity of broadcasting , but it reflects a slow trend by audiences to hold broadcasters more and more at arms length , even suspiciously , a problem which programme-makers increasingly find when they approach the public . In this survey BBC emerged as the channel with most audience credibility for accuracy and interest ; audiences claimed they were able to distinguish where bias had occurred and to // discount it . Research on the Press has shown audiences believe the Press to be more biased . Another 1980s study of audience comprehension of television news ( a BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in taking in the wealth of information that news bulletins throw at them . Perhaps most intriguingly the research found that what was said by television newscasters was much more important than what was seen . The report recommended repetition of important items ; better ordering of items to indicate which were the most important ; the use of graphics wherever possible . It also said broadcasters should be given more incentive to improve comprehensibility . In twenty News and Current Affairs meetings attended by the principal author of the report the audience was mentioned just twice . It is worth emphasising that my own experience is the same as Professor Robinson 's . Over a much wider span of types of meeting audiences were rarely discussed , or even mentioned , except as an abstract concept . Equally , audience members may have very hazy ideas of the broadcasters who make programmes , or of their organisations . While they may have the most clear-cut views ( and factual information ) on the nature of the family structure in , say , Dallas they may have hardly any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by IBA research which showed that about 40 per cent of viewers thought ' Jewel in the Crown ' was a BBC production , rather than a Granada one ; the BBC on the whole , is believed to be the originator of fine classic drama . The BBC suffers here as well as gains , possibly because it is so large . ITV companies may gain by being generally small and relatively regional , although when franchise changes result in new programme companies for an area , local viewers often take some time to appreciate what has happened . But it is true that the BBC is perceived more as an absence than a presence , or as a series of separate bits , radio and television , perhaps a local radio station , or a regional television one . Small group research conducted for this study in May 1985 suggested that for some of the audience at least the image of ' BBC ' is simply non-existent . It may be that , with the slow but accelerating proliferation of broadcasting outlets , to expect audiences at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the casual book reader to be able to identify the publisher , or the newspaper and magazine reader to do likewise . If this is true it will be a much bigger problem for the BBC than for // any other broadcasting organisation , given the organisations belief that it is only by identifying the BBC directly as provider through its programmes that people at least accept the principal of paying for the licence . One of the last major studies undertaken for the BBC on audience attitudes ( the AMBO study . 1980 ) did indeed discover a number of disturbing things . Although nearly three-quarters of the audience had a favourable impression of the BBC , the number who did not had doubled from seven per cent in a previous study to 15 per cent ( i.e. to about a sixth ) . The report also found that for many people the BBC did not exist : the implication here was that the whole range of its activities did not come easily to mind . Unsurprisingly perhaps , in this AMBO study , where BBC political bias was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was right-wing ; about 15 per cent left-wing . The most favourable impressions of the BBC were in the south , the least favourable in the north and in Scotland . On finance three-quarters knew the BBC was financed by licence fee but a surprising 17 per cent believed the money to come directly from Government , a figure to be set against the 30 per cent who thought the BBC to be controlled by Government . In fact 20 per cent favoured direct government financing anyway , 49 per cent thought the BBC should take advertising ( compare this with some of the most recent data from surveys which suggest that a majority by late 1985 favoured the BBC taking advertising if it meant the licence fee could be held steady ) . Thirty-one per cent thought the BBC managed its financial affairs badly ( perhaps reflecting a comparison with other nationalised industries ) ; forty-three per cent thought it could save money without affecting programme standards . What this all means ( or meant ) to the BBC , struggling to keep the public on its side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide . ' Taken with other research ( see The Image Problem ' , below ) , what it seems to amount to is that the public is inconsistent , if not perverse , in its attitudes and , more significantly , its knowledge of broadcasting and how it is put together . The biggest problem remains public indifference to the relationship between good broadcasting and the need for them to pay for it ; and in the frequent misunderstanding of broadcast finance . On this latter point , however , few broadcasters would claim more than a working understanding of the exact sums involved and , certainly , the means of holding costs down . But the public believe firmly that BBC ' stars ' get very large sums indeed to do various shows and this appears to annoy and irritate . // THE IMAGE PROBLEM Part of the BBC 's overall image problem has been to ' explain ' its programme costs , not just its proportionately smaller administrative costs . To a Britain battered by years of public-spending cuts it all looks like too much being spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the research commissioned for the BBC to put its case for a continued licence fee system of finance to the Peacock Committee . Broadcasters have been hoist by their own petard : the distorting mirror of news was being applied to them . Suddenly they were thrown up against a public whose perceptions could not easily be shifted . Ever since the Peacock Committee 's brief had been announced various newspapers had commissioned polls which apparently showed that a majority of the British public were in favour of the BBC taking advertising . The BBC research showed exactly the same , although great effort had gone into asking the question in context . Only two groups did not ( as a majority ) . These were members of the top social scale , ABs , who make up 15 per cent of the population ; the other group were those who said they disapproved of advertising ( 20 per cent of the population ) but even here 37 per cent said they would support advertising on the BBC . But the research did find that the public had no clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for programme output or scheduling and that , in particular . their knowledge of and attitude to the licence fee was ' complex ' ? a conundrum , said the report . The public also appeared to see the output of BBCI similarly to that of ITV ; that of BBC2 to that of Channel Four . They had little idea of how ITV was funded ( along with many professionals who know but vaguely ) . Research in the area of attitudes is notorious for showing what the researcher wants . The arguments much deployed in the Press in the autumn and winter of 1985 consistently suggested that about twothirds of the public would not be unhappy at the BBC taking some advertisements to raise extra money . The Broadcasting Research Unit , in part funded by the BBC , produced further research which said the opposite . Their questions were , however , as loaded as everyone elses , insisting with respondents that they ' understood ' what the implications of advertising on the BBC might be . It was a further irony of the public debate surrounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own research backed // that being espoused in the newspapers . The BMRB research for the BBC found , as with AMBO , that most people knew the BBC was funded from the licence fee , but a large minority ( 17 per cent ) said the Government paid . Although around 90 per cent assumed that this fee paid for television only around half realised it also paid for network radio and less than 40 per cent knew that it paid for BBC local radio . This is an illustration of why most people do not know how ITV is funded ( the ' its free ' belief ) and why if there is not a directly related payment ( as there is no longer for radio ) the public will simply forget , if they ever knew , who pays for a service . Most of those asked ( 28 per cent ) had little idea of how much the current licence was , the average guess putting it lower than the current fee . Even fewer knew by how much it had gone up in 1985 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent rose as the sums presented to them were given in shorter time spans . That is , only 11 per cent agreed it was good value at ? 58 a year but 21 per cent thought so at 15p per day . The bulk of the public appears to believe the licence fee is ' reasonable ' value rather than good value . Overall the BMRB report found : people 's feelings about the licence fee present us with something of conundrum . The majority believe the licence represents value for money and would not wish to give up BBCl/2 in return for paying no licence fee and would he prepared to pay more than the current level to retain BBCl/2 ; but large numbers have difficulty in finding the money to pay it . many have to save up and a substantial minority would prefer to pay in smaller , more frequent instalments . All this , the report concludes , is a puzzle which puts the public in the position of understanding at least part of the licence fee system rationally although disliking it . In that respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their customers to understand the rates and , soon , the community charge . Unfortunately for the BB ( ' broadcasting intrudes on the customer every day , not once or twice a year . Furthermore , parts of the public have begun to insist that they have more than consumer rights : that because broadcasting is the animal it is , they ( we ) should have a much broader range of general rights . As we have seen these include access . Again a paradox arises . It sometimes seems that the voices clamouring for more access ? and those , sometimes in parallel , sometimes not , clamouring for more control ' ? follow a // will-o ' - the- wisp of uncertainty of purpose . So many debates overlap here . There are those who seek pure access because they believe they are not represented ' enough by broadcasting . Minority groups of all kinds are in this group . Then there is a political argument for more access : broadcasting has to express more clearly the aspirations of democracy . Sometimes this gets confused with the minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of control . Mrs Whitehouse and her own stage army of moral majoritists abide here . But there are many other people who , disagreeing with the implications of the Mrs Whitehouses , are nonetheless perturbed at broadcasting 's intrusions and lapses . We know more and more about audiences and audience attitudes ; hardly anything about those of producers , especially their images of the audience . Central to this continuing debate ( which is often simply a messy argument ) is the question of the portrayal of sex and violence on television , brought hack into prominence by the Conservative Government in 1985 groping for a Falklands Factor ' topic to use in a future General Election campaign . In the context of the mid-1980s a book about broadcasters and their audiences has to examine , however briefly , this crown of thorns , not least now because , for the first time , a formal body is about to begin work on deciding where public taste lies in this most delicate of arenas . SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK AND ROLL The BBC receives most complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of this category a considerable proportion of complainers are unhappy about blasphemy . On-screen nudity is another source of many complaints ; violence rates rather less highly . None of this is new : in the 1950s when television was young a similar concern was expressed ? as forcibly ? about violence and sex in children 's comics and in the cinema . Just as it is now , some of that concern was directed at US imports . The attitude of broadcasters ? and this applies to radio drama , for instance ? in this area of public concern has not endeared them to audiences . Although there are guidelines , and these are revised from time to time , read aloud they sound arbitrary and even cynical . The standard reply from broadcasters is that they are ( a ) reflecting reality ' ; ( b ) the actual number of incidents of violence , or explicit // sexual activity , are low ; ( c ) programmes showing this material only go out after 9 pm ; ( d ) audiences like action ' ; and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point was the splash headline in the BBC 's own publication Ariel in December 1985 , when it became obvious that a campaign on reducing levels of violence on television was gathering pace . The headline prefaced a story announcing that the then Director-General , Alasdair Milne , was setting up yet another internal enquiry which would look , yet again , at the evidence ? and commission further research ! As with the newspaper Press , broadcasters use both sex and violence to sell ? in this case programmes . Audiences tuning to late-night horror movies , or to The Sweeney or Kojak know exactly what they are going to get . Violence is excitement ; sex is titillation or arousing or sometimes amusing . Techniques like these have been a part of theatre since ancient Greece and always will be . To argue ' reality ' or to try to give other reasons for incorporating explicit scenes of mayhem , bloodshed or the intimacy of intercourse is to fly in the face of what everyone privately knows and frequently relishes . Having said that , where arc we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mrs Whitehouse would have it , that novelists like Dickens did not have to resort to explicit sex scenes to sell books ; in any case , go back a hundred years to the 18th century and we have fanny Hill ; go back three hundred and we have the appalling and explicit violence of the 17th century dramatist , Webster . The central question about the portrayal ? and degree ? of sex and violence on television , or the use of bad ' language in radio plays is about the relationship between broadcaster and audience . To the extent that Mrs Whitehouse makes plain the arrogance implied by drama programme-makers ( and the rest where the cap tits ) when they dismiss public unhappiness at some of what they produce she does a great service . There is a hypocrisy at work here which denies while busily doing what it denies . In the weeks after it had self-righteously denounced BBC television for the degree of explicit general nastiness in the soap opera EastEnders , the Daily Mirror ran for a week the tape transcripts of the moors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their readers ( presumably including children ) nothing of the truly disgusting details . The separation between the avowed intent of public interest ' and the ' reflecting reality ' of programme-makers is questionable . The Daily Mirror can argue at length , no doubt , that fiction is not the same as fact ; but news coverage has become much more explicit and as the // competition hots up the mistakes multiply , to a point where footage of a public execution can be shown in the early evening news bulletins ( normally the hard stuff ' is kept back until the later news ) . All this can be deeply disturbing to many members of the public . The trigger level ? the moment most people , or even quite a sizeable minority ? get up and publicly protest is probably still some way away . As we have seen , the mechanisms for access , although in theory many , are in practice limited in scope . Part of the BARRTA study , in collaboration with the BBC Broadcasting Research Department Special Projects , polled a national sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially , we were interested in why , as we suspected , so many had in fact not complained . About a third of those interviewed ( in August 1984 ) said they had felt like complaining either very or fairly often . Around half said they had never felt like complaining . The level of feeling like complaining applied more or less evenly to all groups , although there was a slight correlation between a desire to complain and heavy listening and viewing . But only two per cent of the one third who wished to complain had ever bothered to do so . The commonest reason given was that it was too much trouble ( 34 per cent ) or that it would make no difference ( 40 per cent ) . On both counts it is clear that broadcasters have failed to make those existing mechanisms of accountability sufficiently clear-cut and easily accessible , and that they have , even by their own lights , failed to convince that a complaint will be taken seriously . On the second point we shall later see that complaints are examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevance or significance of any one complaint may be erratic , if not downright eccentric . The sample was also asked what influences they thought did affect programme-makers . Only a third of the total interviewed . thought it fairly likely that complaints from ordinary viewers and listeners would have an impact . Bad press reviews , pressure groups like Mrs Whitehouse 's National Viewers and Listeners Association ( NVALA ) and possible criticism from Government , were thought by half to be important . The most important influence , however , was seen to be ratings and pressure from advertisers ? 75 per cent believed that either of these would affect programme-makers ' decisions . Leaving aside the question of advertising , it is demonstrably true that ratings do affect management thinking on programmes , probably too much . This obviously can affect programme-makers either fairly quickly , when a series is running , or more slowly , for future planning . It might affect careers if a disaster were signalled , although this is less // likely . What the survey also showed is an audience which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasters might either allow or particularly like . But sixty years after continuous broadcasting began in Britain , with a television generation behind us , and knowing the average time spent listening to radios or watching television , it should not surprise that many people have a sophisticated knowledge of the broadcasting process . ( As a footnote to this , a BBC special project study on drama output found that many of the sample audience believed that , in one of the plays viewed , the sex scenes were added purely for titillation . ) At the same time misinformation is rife , as is borne out by the study for the BBC about the licence fee . The public , then , probably has in general a fairly good idea of the general operating principles of broadcasting . They may well have a stunningly good idea of the precise details of plot lines , of the public and private , screen and home lives , of many broadcasters . They have very poor knowledge in general of the details of broadcasting operations or its finances . Although two thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has to be compared with the one-third who had heard of open meetings or of the advisory councils . There is a cogent set of arguments which says this is acceptable : do the public know about the management of British Rail , or how consumer products at large are manufactured ? But these arguments mislead . Broadcasters do not believe they are producing the equivalent of moving wallpaper and argue continuously to be treated in a way consistent with the important ? and material and spiritual ? difference of what they make . And it is true that broadcasting impacts every day in the home , the place where people are most vulnerable because most relaxed . If that is the case broadcasting must be treated ? and be prepared to treat of itself ? more like parts of the political system : local government for instance ; or like the Health Service , where the desire for accountability in the stricter definition , has grown apace . It has been part of the cross broadcasters have had to bear that their early reluctance to treat more directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viewers and Listeners Association and the redoubtable Mrs Whitehouse . That lady was early on treated disgracefully by the BBC , who refused to allow her any legitimacy ? and to its long-term cost . Their argument was she represented no one but herself , words which a number of current senior BBC staff must now be chewing on painfully . Ina curious way Mrs Whitehouse did slow down the debate ; few of the // more thoughtful inside or outside broadcasting wished to he associated with NVALA and the moral majority close behind . But while the Right mobilised slowly the Left too began to question the rights of broadcasters . This too is a large debate , which grew all through the 1970s . Broadcasters in part have been more sensitive to , and sensitised by , the Left largely because at programmemaking level many are of liberal if not left persuasion . Out of such sentiment originally came the Open Door ' programmes of the BBC ( and the subsequent constant pressure from management on the Community Programme Unit ) . Pluralism in broadcasting has grown because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Using the Media ( 1979 ) and more recently the excellent Getting It On by Jane Drinkwater . The Media Project , based at The Volunteer Centre in Hertfordshire has helped in social-action broadcasting , whilst many other organisations have become much more aware that the mass media ( not just broadcasting ) offer a means to approach the public on a range of issues . Interest of a more specialist kind has been aroused through partial studies , like the Glasgow Media Group 's Bad News books . It is noticeable that all this activity still resides above the level of the individual . The arrogance of remote broadcasters has given way to earnest discussions with the public ? but only as represented by pressure groups of one kind or another . In that sense the older methods - letters , phone calls , public meetings ? do provide the only way broadcasters normally get to hear or see the man on the Clapham omnibus ; that and the woman in the pub , of course . One criticism of broadcast managements is that they , like politicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch television , if at all , under artificial conditions ; they inhabit a narrowly focused world of high finance and ? in the BBC ? west or south-west London social life . They have friends from a similar background or at least from the professionally successful . Meeting the great unwashed at the BBC public meetings at least gives them a chance to mix , however painfully , with the vulgar but all too real mass , to understand its strange compulsions . ON THE BORDER : DEVELOPING A COMMON CAUSE Broadcasters might at this point begin to remonstrate that if they are ever to make programmes they have to turn their backs on these very // interesting but potentially interfering facts . Part , a large part , of the BBC structure of central management is there to act as a defensive wall behind which creative genius can evolve , untroubled by the mad , the had and the sad . There is an element of truth in that . But broadcasters have to have audiences ; those audiences are no longer willing to be passive recipients of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , radio or Government . Problems and uncertainty naturally grow from this . As well , technology upsets previously safe positions , creates opportunities and challenges for everyone . As it happens this has come together in Britain to create in broadcasting a turbulent field ' . To overcome the immediate uncertainties it is tempting for organisations like the BBC to retreat into secluded if besieged isolation . That attitude still persists , and to a greater degree than is healthy for the BBC . The alternative is on the surface much less appetising : it is to engage in a praxis with the public , to immerse itself in the debate it has , admittedly , frequently called for but which it has appeared to use as a smoke-screen to cover its rapid and at times undignified scramble for the fortress walls . 6 Hide and Seek : Broadcasters and Audience Research ' There is a view that says that above all else broadcasters have become obsessed by the ratings , the weekly , quarterly and annual sets of figures which show which channel has had what share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The impression that this is true is easy enough to understand . Broadcasters have frequently given it in the way they react in public to programmes and how they are described . But broadcasting exists in a semi-vacuum . Its products disappear at the moment of realisation . The figures provided by an increasingly sophisticated audience research survey are the stuff of one kind of reality . What else can be measured ? As time has passed , and the dual system of British broadcasting has become more embedded so the ' ratings battle ' itself has taken on a ritual meaning . Changes are now taking place , where challenges to the meaning of ratings as well as to their statistical validity , are part of the challenge being made to the structure of broadcasting . We have not yet reached a point where those challenges are so obvious to most broadcasters . But , slowly , it is penetrating the minds of all broadcasters that knowledge of the audience well beyond raw viewing or listening figures is desirable and available . The techniques of social and market research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything can he settled by having the biggest audience at any one time . As competition between BBC television and ITV hotted up in the I960s so the ratings , and winning and losing audience shares , became more and more critical to broadcasting . In this war ' there is no doubt that the more aggressive protagonist was the BBC . The reasons for this are not hard to find . For thirty years it was a monopoly ; other than turning to foreign radio stations like Radio Normandie in the I't ( ls and Radio Luxembourg in the 1940s and 1950s audiences had no choice but to listen to the BBC . When television opened again after the Second World War it began with a small audience . Television did not become a national medium until well into the 1950s ? arguably alter the arrival of commercial television when people had a choice . // From that point on BBC television lost heavily in the ratings war , reduced at one moment in the late 1950s to a share below 30 per cent of total audience . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised there might be a reaction from the audience at large to reject payment of the licence fee . In hitting back with programmes that a mass audience would tune to , the BBC began a long hard haul to keep the balance of audience share at around 50 per cent . To its credit it has often managed to do better than that but older ideas about what was public service broadcasting kept ( and keeps ) BBC television at a potential disadvantage . It still puts out less entertainment at peak times than does ITV . The battle lines are now confused by the addition of both BBC2 and Channel Four . But audience weekly shares by the mid-eighties were roughly settled such that BBC1 gets about 35 per cent ; ITV about 45 per cent ; BBC2 and Channel Four about 10 per cent each . Much can be made ? probably irrelevantly ? of why this is so . The key to success in the settled system of the duopoly is that the balance does not , over a year , alter much from a ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strange ambivalence about winning the ratings battle in the BBC . Although the BBC has to demonstrate it is able to retain the very largest audiences available it also has , as a vital part of its function , what PeterJay once called a mission to explain ' . There is no immorality in being too popular , but there are associated dangers . To be equal , occasionally ahead , but not to be obviously , consistently beating commercial television ( and radio , although the battle here is unequal ) , is all the Corporation desires . This makes the BBC the more aggressive partner in the ratings game because it actively seeks a precise place in the total ratings , whereas ITV can go for maximum size at all times . It also means , pace BBC television schedulers , that they have often in the past been more defensive in their scheduling . Finally , there is just an element of guilt in the Corporation about ratings at all . The defensiveness of the BBC has another root . When it was decided to re-schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nine O'Clock News ' a public ' outcry could be heard from some quarters denouncing the abandonment of public service virtues . The BBC is peculiarly prone to these pressures , which can be considerable , because it is after all a public body . The public service element in ITV ( and ILR ) is there by secondary consideration , whatever the IBA may argue . No one is surprised if ITV wishes to maximise its audiences through popular programming . The BBC , by contrast , is expected to succeed but not too well , as if mere success // ( as judged by audience size ) is a vulgar beginning of a slide away from public service . The ' public ' who make this an issue tend to be the powerful and articulate . Often media trade unions are among the more vociferous in making their point on these grounds . The most notorious parts of this lobby wheel into action for Radio Four and Radio Three ; their existence is a mixed blessing for network controllers and BBC broadcast managers . The arrival of Channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old certainties , but not that much . Channel Four has now settled into a slot which may mean the permanent reduction of the total BBC share to well below 50 per cent , while previously it had taken in total about 50 per cent . Thus Channel Four has reversed the system ' balance ' . The alarms ringing in the period between 1983 and 1986 about the BBC 's decline may now be put into context . Indeed at least one senior BBC official had accurately predicted the medium term impact that Channel Four would have on BBC total audience share . We still had , in 1988 , a rough balance , now maintained over 20 years of television . This is much more remarkable than it seems at first sight . British television appears to have worked inside a very powerful consensus of broad agreement about public service and public taste ; a consensus now largely missing . Until now this has been largely defined within the traditions of the BBC , not just as premier programme-maker but as the supreme arbiter of the meaning of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and audience research is part of the weaponry deployed on both sides . It has , in a final analysis , the weight of numbers to reinforce its validity , whatever they might be taken to mean . MEASURING WHAT ? An audience research department began in the BBC in 1939 although audiences had been measured on an ad hoc basis during the 1930s . The department was set up to measure reaction to programmes rather than audience size . The onset of competition changed that drastically . When ITV started advertisers had to know how many people were watching at any given time , rather than their reactions to a programme . ITV ( commercial broadcasting in general ) is designed to deliver audiences to advertisers in particular packages ; that is how it collects its revenue and why advertisers pay . It is a neat inversion of the duty of the BBC which is , roughly , to deliver programmes to audiences . // The problem for ITV in 1955 was that it had to introduce a system of audience measurement which advertisers would accept : the result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAM ) meters in selected homes , all over the country as the commercial system spread . These registered which channel the television set was tuned . to . The measurement system was eventually taken over by JICTAR ( Joint Industry Committee for Television Audience Research ) , whose partners were the Independent Television Companies Association ; the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising . JICTAR research was aimed at reach and frequency ; that is it was a longitudinal study , made up of the panel of metered homes . To select the panel it conducted an annual establishment survey , a high quality random survey of homes taken from the electoral register . Interviewers were then dispatched to ensure that those homes picked out for metering did contain within their household the right characteristics for inclusion . But of the 2400 homes on the panel there was constant attrition ; some householders refused to co-operate or withdrew early ; replacement was a continuing requirement along with strict controls to keep the whole sample representative . Also there were continuous problems in the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the television set , families were asked to keep a weekly diary of viewing and each week the householder posted back the tape from the meter along with the diary . Both were fed into a computer and the diary and tape married to programme output . A difficulty of this system is that the tape data and the diary information may not match . The system was designed to edit out a diary entry when the meter tape showed the set was not on ; but there were many times when the opposite was true : that is , the set was on but no one was watching it . Finally under the JICTAR system there was the fundamental question unanswered as to what ' viewing ' meant . The fact that the television set was on , that there was someone in the room ( and recorded as such ) did not indicate attention or interest . The BBC started from a very different position . When the Daily Survey started in 1939 , a fundamental issue was public accountability ? was the service adequate in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' into the streets and asked . Approximately 2000 people , aged five and over , were stopped every day at around 150 points selected to be representative of the UK . By 1968
