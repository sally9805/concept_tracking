Throughout the night , because of the glow from the neon lights of Reno , 30 miles to the south , there has been no true darkness in the sky over Pyramid Lake . Not until 6:30 a.m. does the first finger of sunlight come over the Nightingale Mountains to the east . Then , in the dim light of dawn on this strange and legendary lake on the Paiute Indian reservation , the first-time visitor is witness to a seemingly inexplicable sight . // On the western shore fly-fishermen are working in a style that shows them to be expert in the ways of Stillwater trout fishing . They are throwing the long , heavy lines that anglers call shooting heads . They barely pause between stripping in one cast and sending the next one flying out over the flat surface . While this in itself is not remarkable , the visitor blinks in disbelief because it appears that all these anglers are standing on the water . The sight is made stranger still by the chest-high waders all of them are wearing . // Not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the fishermen are finally rewarded is the mystery solved . As the fish thrashes , the angler steps down into the water . It suddenly becomes clear that he has been standing atop a stepladder. // The fisherman uses one hand to steady himself as he descends , the other to hold his rod high so that the formidable fish he has hooked can run free . Now he is chest-deep in ice-cold water as he fights the trout , backing up  --  when the fish allows  --  into shallower water . At last the battle nears its end in the shallows , and the newcomer sees the fisherman slide the big trout onto the sandy beach . He asks the angler not to release the fish quite yet so that he might approach and see it more closely . // " Cock fish , ready to spawn , " says the fisherman , who will later make himself known as Bernie Crooks . It 's more than 11 pounds , maybe 12 , reddish brown in color , heavily speckled with gray spots and slashed with glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully removes the fly , a black leechlike creation known as a Woolly Bugger , and glides the fish through the bright shoreline water and back toward the dark depths . The trout 's gills pulse steadily , and then , with a flashing swipe of its tail , it is gone . // The visitor watches the fish disappear into the slightly saline waters of Pyramid Lake . This is the first specimen he has ever seen of Salmo clarki henshawi , the great Lahontan cutthroat trout , a fish that was generally thought to have been extinct for two or three decades . // Meantime , Crooks is in no hurry to start fishing again . He is a thick , balding man of 46 , and he has discovered that Pyramid Lake is perfect therapy for the stress of his day-to-day life at Reno Airport as a customer-service agent , which entails ticketing , handling baggage and telling standbys that the plane is completely filled . Even after 30 years of fishing this high-desert lake , he is fascinated by its ways . // " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from my fire went straight up into the air , " he says . " Then here would come two-and three-foot swells . They must have just spawned on the other side . I do n't know what from . This lake is special to the Paiute Indians , and they have many stories to tell about it . They say you can hear crying at night  --  babies crying . They call them water babies , and they say they were Indian children that drowned in the lake . You hear all kinds of stories . But I 'll tell you for sure , Pyramid Lake does not give up its dead . A Navy plane went in last year , and they never found the crew , only a piece of wing and a part of the motor . " // Crooks is not the first man to be captivated by Pyramid Lake . In 1844 the advance party of the explorer John C. Fremont " discovered " the lake . Actually , the group was lost ; Fremont thought he was on the return route to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what Fremont wrote in his journal on Jan. 10 , 1844 : " Leaving a signal for the party to encamp , we continued our way up the hollow ... the snow deepening to about a foot as we reached the summit . Beyond , a defile between the mountains descended rapidly about 2,000 feet ; and , filling up all the lower space , was a sheet of green water some twenty miles broad . It broke upon our eyes like the ocean .... The waves were curling in the breeze , and their dark green color showed it to be a body of deep water . For a long time we sat enjoying the view for we had become fatigued with the mountains .... " // The next day Fremont and his group made their way down to the lake . On Jan. 13 they headed south along the lakeshore , right into the teeth of a blizzard that blew up a five-foot surf and created deep snowdrifts on the beaches . But the following day the lake radically changed its mood . The snow melted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely aware of during the storm . It was a rock out in the water that , according to his journal . " presented a pretty exact outline of the great pyramid of Cheops .... So I called it Pyramid Lake , though it may be deemed by some to be a fanciful resemblance . " // Eventually , Fremont came upon a shoreside Indian village , where he was offered a fish for trade . It made almost as much of an impression on him as had the lake from which it was taken . Wrote Fremont : " We had the inexpressible satisfaction to find that it ! was a salmon trout ; we gathered round him eagerly . The Indians were amused by our delight and brought in numbers so that the camp was soon stocked . Their flavor was excellent  --  superior , in fact to that of any fish I have ever known . They were of extraordinary size  --  about as large as the Columbia River salmon  --  generally from two to four feet long . " // Though he did n't know it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously , the Northern Paiute tribe and the Lahontan cutthroat trout . Moreover , the lake he had just named would turn out to be one of the most geologically significant bodies of water in North America . It is the last remnant of the 70,000-year-old Great Lahontan Lake . In the centuries that followed its creation , the lake grew and retreated at least four times . When it was large , it was huge  --  covering more than 9,000 square miles of what is now northwestern Nevada and northeastern California . It dwindled to its present size , a mere 30-mile-long puddle , about 8,000 years ago . // But while Lahontan Lake was shrinking , the opposite was occurring to some of its inhabitants . The Lahontan cutthroat evolved into the biggest member of the trout family . Heaven knows how big the fish got in prehistoric times , but the modern high-water mark is a 41-pounder taken by a Paiute named John Skimmerhorn in 1925 . Scientists believe the Lahontan cutthroat  --  one of 14 subspecies of the cutthroat species  --  grew so large because its main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chub . To survive in the Lahontan , the trout had to evolve genetically so that they could feed on something that big . // The size of the Lahontan cutthroat almost proved to be its undoing . The commercial fishery that developed for the breed drastically reduced its population . In the winter and spring of 1888-89 , 100 tons of cutthroat trout were shipped from Pyramid Lake by Wells . Fargo , not just to epicures in fine restaurants but to railroad crews , road gangs and mining camps . // In the first decades of the 1900s , sport fishermen also depleted the lake 's stock of trout . In those days Reno was the divorce capital of the nation . As few as six weeks were needed to establish residency , a prerequisite for obtaining a divorce , and the laws favored the plaintiff . One way to kill the six or so weeks was to dangle some bait in Pyramid and catch a 20-pound cutthroat . The Hollywood crowd also frequented the lake . In one photo , Clark Gable , not a hair out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , while fishermen of all kinds were depleting the numbers of Lahontan trout and thereby weakening its reproductive pool , men with slide rules , not fishing rods , would do the most damage to the fish . What eventually caused the Lahontan trout to disappear from Pyramid Lake was the building of the Derby Dam on the Truckee River , the lake 's only source of water and the only place where they spawned . The dam was completed in 1905 to divert much of the Truckee 's water into the Carson Basin for agricultural uses and electric power . A " fish pass " was built into the dam , but as early as 1912 , it was condemned by three Nevada fish commissioners as " inadequate . " // " Tons of fish have died at Derby Dam , " wrote the commissioners . " Millions of eggs have been lost . " Eventually the fish pass fell apart . // With the dam in place , the water level of the lake dropped , exposing sandbars at the mouth of the Truckee . Consequently , fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutthroat kept trying to make their spawning runs , but could n't make it over the dam . Trapped , they became easy prey for the farmers , who would catch them with pitchforks , throw them into carts and use them as fertilizer . The fish 's last spawning run came in 1938 , when , according to Dr. Robert Behnke of Colorado State University , the few remaining trout averaged 20 pounds . Soon after that  --  the lifespan of the species is about seven years  --  the Lahontan trout in Pyramid Lake were extinct . // The Derby Dam also came close to destroying another fish , the cui-ui , a suckerlike species named by the Paiute . In his office in Nixon , Nev. , near Pyramid Lake , tribal chairman Joe Ely explained to the visitor the significance to his people of the fish and the lake where it lives . " You call this Pyramid Lake , right ? " said Ely . " Because John Fremont called it that back in 1844 , because when he came over the mountain it seemed the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Ely pointed to a picture on the wall and continued , " Have you seen that formation ? The one we call the Stone Mother ? " The great piece of tufa looks almost like a statue of an old woman with a woven basket . // " The story the Paiute have of her is that she and her husband and two children moved in this direction from the north and stopped in the desert , " said Ely . " There was no lake here then . But the two boys fought constantly , and their father sent them away , never to return . The mother learned what had happened when she returned from gathering food that day . Her tears became Cui-ui-pah , which is our name for the lake . And a fish , the cui-ui , which you would call a sucker , sprang up  --  and the people , the Cui-ui tuccatta eaters of the cui-ui . These are the three elements  --  the lake , the fish and the people  --  that make up the tribe . " // The cui-ui are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they , too , spawned in the Truckee River . " So when you talk about our struggle for the fish , " said Ely , " it is not merely a fish but an intricate part of who we are , of our identity . " // Although the cutthroats were important to the Paiute economy , that fish was never considered an integral part of their culture . For the Indians , the biggest annual festival of all was the harvesting of the cui-ui fish . " It would run for two or three weeks in midspring  --  the rest of the year the cui-ui would live in inaccessible depths , " said Ely . " But at festival time the water would turn black with cui-ui like the Lahontan cutthroats , the cui-ui grew to remarkable size , as much as 10 pounds in the shallows . After the cui-ui were caught , they were dried and stored for the coming year . They were our staple food . // " I 'm looking for an analogy . " said Ely , and after a pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desecration of the American flag , all the fervor and conviction it 's arousing . People ask us , So what is this fish that nobody likes , that nobody else wants ? Essentially , it is a flag  --  a symbol . In the first 40 years after the dam was built , the lake had dropped 70 feet . The Lahontan cutthroat disappeared , and the cui-ui numbers shrank to a point where harvest became impossible . Pyramid 's sister lake , Winnemucca , dried completely . " // What should have been the coup de grace came in 1944 , when the federal government tried to settle how the water of the Truckee  --  and by extension , Pyramid Lake  --  would be allocated . The principal claimants were the city of Reno , farmers to the east of the lake and the Paiute . The Paiute were represented by the Bureau of Indian Affairs . // " The bureau made a critical error on our account and a near fatal one for the fish , " said Ely . " It was an error that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our tribe . We tried to explain our status as ' fishermen , ' but the BIA insisted on representing us as ' farmers . ' The result was called the Orr Ditch Decree . It might have been called the Last Ditch . From receiving 450,000 acre-feet of water annually  --  it takes at least 400,000 a year just to replace Pyramid Lake 's evaporation losses  --  we were cut down to 31,000 acre-feet for agriculture irrigation and zero for fisheries . " // So how come in the spring of 1989 , Crooks  --  from his perch atop his step-ladder  --  not only has caught a dozen or so Lahontan but also is climbing back up those ladder rungs with every hope of landing another one ? Had n't Ely said the trout were gone from Pyramid Lake by the early ' 40s ? The lake , the experts thought , was by then so shrunken and saline that it could no longer support any species of trout or salmon , and certainly not the cutthroat . Or could it ? // In 1948 , Thomas Trelease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game Commission , had an idea that , one would think , would have been tried earlier . In an attempt to see whether any trout could live in such salty water , he dunked rainbows enclosed in cages into the lake . Those fish , which were not released , survived . Thus the way was open for efforts to restock Pyramid . However , not until after 1956  --  when Congress passed the Washoe Act , which returned to the lake some of the water that had been diverted to the farmers , and provided facilities for restoring the fish  --  did any serious restocking effort begin . // In the ' 60s and ' 70s the state planted in Pyramid thousands of Salmo clarki henshawi from Heenan Lake in California and Walker and Summit lakes in Nevada , lakes all thought possibly to have been part of Lake Lahontan Basin . Those fish prospered , and anglers began to enjoy fine fishing again . Ten-pounders were not unusual , and every now and then a 20-pounder was landed . It seemed that Pyramid Lake was on its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . // Except that the cutthroats from Heenan and Walker lakes were probably not true Lahontan cutts after all ; they showed evidence of hybridization with rainbows . Further , many of the cutthroats from Summit Lake did not appear to have the gene pattern that had permitted the Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroats to reach such enormous sizes . A 40-pound cutthroat from Pyramid Lake had become an impossibility now . thought many biologists . // Down at the lakeside , late in the day . Crooks asks the visitor . " Do you want to see the hatchery ? " The visitor does , but first there is a question that has been bothering him since daybreak . " The  --  uh  --  ladder ? " asks the visitor . // " Well , it used to be milk crates . " says Crooks . " If you wade out to a level of , say , hip-deep , you 're always fishing and having to hold your arms up out of the water . You get super tired . So you stand on one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " says the visitor . // " Oh , sure , " said Crooks . " Everybody takes a fall now and then . And before you ask , Yes , the lake is cold . This was the coldest year I fell in. " // The cutthroat hatchery Crooks takes the visitor to is near the community of Sutcliffe , on the western side of the lake . The fish are strong and handsome , scarlet males , silver females . " The fish are getting bigger , " says Lee Carlson , the biologist on duty as he looks at the records to verify what he has just said . " In 1980 we were averaging 3.4-pounders . In ' 86 it was 4.6 , and so far this year we 're at five pounds . " // So , might we someday see more 40-pounders ? Carlson is cagey about these breeding fish . He , too , raises the issue of the lost gene pattern for large size . But he has n't given up hope : The actual Pyramid Lake strain may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graduate student in wildlife biology at Colorado State , found a colony of tiny true Lahontan trout in Donner Creek , a small creek on the Utah-Nevada line . According to decades-old records kept by the California and Nevada fisheries departments , Donner Creek was most recently stocked in 1930  --  and at that time from only one source . Pyramid Lake . So far attempts to reestablish these true Lahontan cutthroats in their home waters have been inconclusive , but the effort continues . Should pending legislation pass , Pyramid Lake will get back more of the water it needs , and that will be a benefit not only to the cutthroats but to the cui-ui as well . // Now , late in the afternoon , the hatchery explored and the fishing over for the day , Crooks points to the sky . Blue all day , it has now turned hazy . " Contrails , " he says . " The haze is caused by aircraft contrails that have gotten spread out till they cover the sky . This is a major air route from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze seems symbolic of the pressures on Pyramid Lake . " Ever think there 'll be a 40-pounder caught here again ? " says the vistor. // " Hey , give them time , " replies Crooks . " They took 10,000 years to get to that weight before . " // The visitor wonders if Pyramid Lake has another 10,000 years at its disposal .
