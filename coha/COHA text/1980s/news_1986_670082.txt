TORONTO  --  Campeau Corp. is seeking an injunction in the Court of Chancery in Delaware to block Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and investor Paul A. Bilzerian from proceeding with an offer to acquire Allied Stores Corp. for $67 a share , or $3. 56 billion . Campeau , which has made a hostile takeover bid for Allied , said in a court filing that Allied ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties by not negotiating with Campeau and favoring the DeBartolo group with confidential information about Allied . The Allied board has endorsed the DeBartolo bid , which was made by ASC Acquisition Corp. , 90%-owned by DeBartolo and 10% by Mr. Bilzerian . Campeau also accused Allied of subsidizing the DeBartolo bid . Under a merger accord between Allied and ASC , Allied has agreed to pay ASC in excess of $80 million if the ASC bid doesn ' t succeed . " The playing field has been tilted decidedly in favor of DeBartolo , " Campeau said . Orren F. Knauer , an Allied vice president said , " ( The complaint ) is being reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no comment . " DeBartolo officials couldn ' t be reached for comment . " It ' s without merit , a sign of weakness and a last ditch attempt , " said Daniel J. Good , managing director and head of principal investments at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , which is representing DeBartolo . " Our attorneys tell us it ' s highly unlikely that it will stop anything . We ' ll go into court with a vigorous defense , " he added . A source close to Campeau said the Delaware court will hear the request for an injunction Oct. 23 . In its filing , Campeau also accused Allied of failing to disclose its negotiations with DeBartolo " while at the same time asserting the illegitimate interest of wishing to remain independent . " As previously reported , Campeau , a real estate developer , offered to buy 40. 8 million shares of Allied ' s common stock for $66 each , or about $2. 7 billion . On a fully diluted basis , Allied would have more than 53 million shares outstanding . DeBartolo , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shopping malls .

DeBartolo Sr. and Thomas Macioce , Allied ' s chairman , met at Mr. Macioce ' s urging Sept. 10 to discuss a possible transaction between DeBartolo and Allied . On Sept. 15 , Mr. DeBartolo indicated in a draft letter of intent that he was willing to acquire Allied for $62 a share , according to the filing . Campeau at the time was seeking to acquire control of Allied for $58 a share . Messrs . DeBartolo and Macioce met again Sept. 25 and Sept. 30 , according to the Campeau filing .
