These Astros are playing like a team possessed , and for good reason . After 19 years of frustration , they are one victory away from a berth in the World Series . And not even the loss of yet another key star can discourage them . The moment little Joe Morgan hit a booming triple in the 11th inning yesterday , the Astrodome crowd of 44,443 went into a frenzy that didn ' t end until some 40 minutes later . The celebration reached its peak when a sacrifice fly by Dennis Walling scored pinch runner Rafael Landestoy with the run Houston needed for a 1-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies and a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five National League championship series . But the fact they won merely scratches the surface of the Astros ' quest . Houston has been a poor cousin in baseball circles since the NL expanded here on April 10 , 1962 . The wealth of talent produced by the Astros ranges from the Rusty Staubs and Jim Wynns of the ' 60s to the Cesar Cedenos , Joe Morgans and Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz , Enos Cabell and Terry Puhl . It was a franchise that did everything but win a pennant . But after yesterday ' s victory , which put the Astros on the brink of their first league title , even that seemed possible , despite the loss of Cedeno for the rest of postseason competition with a compound dislocation and ligament damage in his right ankle . Cedeno , who fell at first base after grounding into an inning-ending double play in the sixth , was taken to Methodist Hospital , where surgery was performed to repair the ligaments . But even the departure of a .309 hitter didn ' t daunt the Astros . " I know it ( the pennant ) is something that I have been looking forward to since 1975 , " said third baseman Cabell . " We ' ve had a lot of adversities and players falling by the wayside . But we set a goal this year to win the National League West , and we did . Now the goal is the pennant , and we ' re almost there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re a team that has confidence . We had it in spring training . We had it in Los Angeles and we have it now . We know teams can beat up on our pitchers . But they can ' t hit home runs in this park , and that ' s what Philly has to do to beat us . " We lost Cedeno today . But it is just like when we lost James Rodney ( Richard ) . Somebody came off the bench to take his place , and we kept on winning . That ' s what we have to do now . " Heck , I ' m hurting . I pulled a groin muscle trying to steal early in the game . In the 11th , I told Joe , I can ' t play anymore . You have to do something . ' And that ' s why he did . " The Astros know how to play in their park , escaping through double plays , intentional walks and assorted ploys . They don ' t have much punch , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 innings with a superb six-hit effort . Dave Smith pitched out of a tough jam in the 11th , striking out pinch hitter Del Unser with two on after one of seven intentional walks issued in the contest . Perhaps an indication of the kind of day it would be for the Phillies came in the third inning . With a man on , Greg Luzinski hit a ball 390 feet that would have been a home run in any other ballpark . Cruz caught it easily , and suddenly it became apparent that even if the Phillies came up with their best shots off Niekro , they ' d still be in trouble . " People asked me if I minded coming out after the 10th inning , " said Niekro . " I told them no , because all I ' m doing is my job . I don ' t think we necessarily have an advantage just because we play in this park . But we ' re more used to games like this because we play these kind of games all year . " We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know if we get good pitching and defense , we ' ve always got a chance to win the game . My job is to keep the other team from scoring . That ' s what I did . " To the Phillies ' credit , they did the same thing to Houston until the 11th despite various Astro threats . Houston received five intentional walks , three to Cruz , who has been devastating in this series . The first three worked as the Phillies escaped jams . Starter Larry Christenson wriggled out of two tight spots that way , then benefited from the double play that bailed him out in the sixth . Dickie Noles took over for Christenson after the sixth , and Tug McGraw , who went the final three innings , got out of another predicament thanks to an intentional walk . But his luck ran out in the 11th . Morgan ' s triple was poetic justice . Garry Maddox had robbed him of a potential game-winning double with a running catch in the eighth when manager Bill Virdon was toying with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball was just out of the reach of right fielder Bake McBride , who crashed into the wall , enabling the gimpy Morgan to reach third . " It may have looked like I was in trouble , " said Morgan . " But I can run . I didn ' t feel anything rounding second , and if the third- base coach ( Don Leppert ) hadn ' t held me up , I ' d have gone for a home run . That ' s what you can do in this park . The pain is there , but I don ' t worry about that . There is a lack of strength in my legs , but I work on it every night with weights . " Morgan didn ' t have to worry . Virdon sent in Landestoy as a pinch runner , and the Phillies made the mistake of leaving the weak-armed Luzinski in left field . Cruz and pinch hitter Art Howe were walked intentionally , loading the bases and setting up a force situation , and when Walling ' s fly ball went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a shot to get Landestoy . But Luzinski ' s throw barely got past third . The run scored , and Houston moved a step closer to its day in the sun . " I ' d say we ' re in deep trouble , " Phillie manager Dallas Green replied to the obvious question . " Naturally , we ' re down a little , but we ' ll be back tomorrow . Right now we ' re not getting any offense . But their guys pitched very well . And so did ours . I ' ll tell you that it was a hell of a baseball game . " But it was a game the Phillies lost . And if that happens again today , they will be through for the year . And the Astros can celebrate in earnest .
