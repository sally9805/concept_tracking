by Paul Rosenfield erodynamically the bum-blebee should n't be able to fly , " says Mary Kay . " But the bumblebee does n't know it , so it goes on flying anyway . " And a gold-and-diamond-studded bumblebee pin is Mary Kay 's favorite award for the hundreds of lady sales executives who are out flying up to success  --  for many , success beyond their fondest dream . .. and a more beautiful life . No doubt about it , their queen and role model is Mary Kay . She reciprocates their devotion : " They think I hung the moon , " she laughingly concedes . Her bumblebees are former teachers , housewives , nurses and secretaries who are now soaring in the rarefied stratosphere of high finance more often dominated by gentlemen of heavy industry . Their queen bee is chairman of Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc. , a company of 150,000 independent consultants and 3,000 directors with gross sales in 1980 of $167 million . The analogy here is that in the atmosphere of such giants as Avon Products and Tupperware , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . But the Mary Kay people do n't know that  --  and they fly anyway . Although the spacious 8th-floor office in the gold-glass Mary Kay Cosmetics high rise near downtown Dallas might suggest otherwise , success has not spoiled Mary Kay Ash . The clear , penetrating , gray-green eyes of the founder and board chairperson of Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc. , testify to her love for people and for the world of high-level business , in which determination . talent and devotion to God have helped her carve a special niche . Unspoiled as well by the mischief of time , this blonde , perfectly coiffed , ultra-suede-attired great-grandmother ( for the fourth time ) will talk about everything but her age . " A woman who will tell her age will tell anything , " is her stock answer . Reminded that great-grandmothers do not easily happen at the age of 50 , which she could pass for , a soft smile courses across the face that has n't a wrinkle : a perfect advertisement for the array of beauty products that have made her queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . The eight-story building , occupied solely by Mary Kay executives and 40 percent of the company 's 1,000 employees , sits adjacent to heavily traveled Stemmons Freeway as it meanders out to Texas Stadium , home of the Dallas Cowboys . When the building was finished in late 1977 at a cost of $5.7 million , it was completely paid for . Recently , the firm bought 170 acres northeast of Texas Stadium for " long-term corporate needs . " Rarely are the double doors to Mary Kay 's white-walled office closed . It is n't unusual for visitors touring the building to stick their heads in and wave , just to get an eyeful of the pink antique chairs , the imported chandelier , the beige carpet with its sculptured floral border in pink , green and white and the lighted breakfront filled with porcelain  --  gifts from Mary Kay beauty consultants all over the United States . What they do not see is the adjoining powder room in white marble with pink accents . Although she spends a lot of her time trying to be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence  --  the pink Cadillac , the black Cadillac limousine , the adoring people who work for her and with her and her position as chairwoman of the $15 million building-fund drive for her church , Preston-wood Baptist  --  it 's difficult to ignore the fact that Mary Kay Ash is doing quite well indeed . Yet , there is a word for the early years of Mary Kathlyn Wagner . It is pathetic . She grew up in Hot Wells , Texas , a wide spot in the road 25 miles from Houston , where her parents owned a hotel . It was one of those small , quaint places , where people from Houston liked to drive for Sunday dinner because her mother was a good cook . Her mother , Lula , actually kept the place going , especially when Mary Kay 's father , Alec , developed tuberculosis , had to stop work the rest of his life and spent three years in a sanatorium at San Angelo in the arid part of West Texas . " I was seven years old then , " Mary Kay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I took care of my father . You can imagine how much time that gave me to be like other little girls . " It was housework , cooking and many terse telephone conversations during the day with her mother , who by then had sold the Hot Wells hotel and leased a small cafe on Washington Avenue in Houston , which she operated for 40 years . It was near the Southern Pacific Railway depot , and her customers did n't demand fancy food  --  they were railroad men . " I did n't know much about cooking , so I had to telephone Mother at the cafe to ask her about things . Everything , " Mary Kay said . " Maybe to ask how to cook potato soup . Father liked that and I did n't know what to do . I can still hear Mother telling me to get out the big pot , use two potatoes , two onions and take a cup of cream off the top of the milk . " ' You can do it , ' Mother would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that positive phrase has certainly applied . " Forays into downtown Houston , alone and on a streetcar , were a specialty of Mary Kay 's in those days . She was only seven , but when she went shopping , she always had the money because the family could n't pay for it any other way . " I remember one day when I went into a store to buy something and the clerk looked at me . She asked who was with me , and I just told her not to worry because I had the money and I knew what I wanted , " she said . " After she saw the money , she made a sale . " Mary Kay and her family lived on Kane Street in Houston in those days . Around the corner on Decatur lived her friend , Dorothy Zapp , who had long blonde curls and doting parents . Unknowingly , she was a great influence in Mary Kay 's life . " Whatever Dorothy did , I had to do better , " Mary Kay said . " At home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best , you see , because Dorothy had everything I wanted to have and did everything I wanted to do . " Consequently , Mary Kay still has the little green vase she won for being the best in Mrs. Davis ' typing class at Dow Junior High in Houston . One year , she also won second place in the state of Texas in extemporaneous speaking . " All the fringe benefits in my life came through inspiration to be better at things than Dorothy Zapp , " she said . " She made me better than I really was . " When Mary Kay was 18 , she graduated from Reagan High School . There was no money for college and there were no scholarships , either . Since Dorothy enrolled at Rice Institute in Houston , Mary Kay had to do something , too . She got married . The groom was Ben Rogers , " the Elvis Presley of Houston in those days , " who sang and played guitar on a radio program . The marriage lasted through 11 years and three children , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II . He wanted a divorce . So there was Mary Kay  --  on her own , with three children and no training . For a while , during the time Ben was in service , she had tried college . " I really wanted to be a doctor , so I took premed courses at the University of Houston , " she said . " But in those days , you had to fib about being married to get into college , so I wore bobby socks just like the other teen-agers and put my wedding band on a chain around my neck . " It did n't last long , because studying with three children did n't work very well . While Ben was still in the army , however , a friend had told Mary Kay about Stanley Home Products . She tried that and also took a job as secretary to the Reverend Lewis B. Quarles at Tabernacle Baptist Church in Houston for $125 per month . Ben 's service pay was only $80 per month , and besides , the church had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl with one or two dresses , her mother saw to it that the child was in Sunday school every week . In Stanley sales , which involved conducting demonstrations and sales parties at people 's homes , Mary Kay discovered that people liked to talk to her . Still , her sales volume was low and a real trauma developed when Stanley people started talking about a convention to be held at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas . " It was so exciting , but the problem was the $12 for the round trip by train and three days at the hotel , " Mary Kay said . " That did n't include food , and I had no money . It worried me because I liked to eat . " Using one of her Stanley demonstration cases for luggage , she borrowed the $12 from a friend across the street and took a train to Dallas . " I sat on the back row and watched them crown Laveda O'Brien Queen of Sales , " Mary Kay said . She was R tall , skinny brunette and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was unsuccessful . " Mary Kay knew it would take more than dieting and dyeing her hair to change things , but her pas sion was to be crowned Queen of Sales . At that convention , they said the customary things to in spire all the ladies : " Hitch your wagon to a star " . . . " Get a rail road track to run on " .. . " Tell somebody what you are going to do . " That 's when Mary Kay , after taking 19 pages of notes , told Frank Stanley Beveridge. president of Stariley Products : " I 'm Mary Kay Rogers , and next year I am going to be Queen of Sales . " Beveridge did not laugh . Instead , he took her hand , looked into her eyes and said , " Somehow , I think you will . " Somehow , she was . And al though she had wanted that alligator bag they gave Laveda O'Brien " with every fiber of my being , " she got a trophy instead . In 1953 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business offer in St. Louis seemed better . When the St. Louis venture failed , Mary Kay joined a similar firm , World Gift , in Houston and made $1,000 a month the first year . Before the year was out , she was area manager , then national training director , where she developed 43 states and traveled three weeks out of every four . After 11 years , an efficiency expert told the company Mary Kay 's power was too great , and the pot began to boil . " The company offered me a unit managership all over the United States , but I would have had to move every six months . I turned it down and resigned , " she said . " I was crushed . I would have gone back if they had called , but they did n't . " So she sat down at her dining-room table with a legal-sized note pad , determined to write her memoirs . " Mainly , I was doing it to help other women , " Mary Kay said . " I spent a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness . " What she ended up with was a long list of problems women in business have , but what she did n't have was a way to solve them . She read and reread the notes and resolved a plan : " I just decided to put my money where my mouth was . " Since 1953 , Mary Kay had been using a beauty product developed by a woman in a Dallas suburb . Mary Kay 's skin had responded beautifully . When the lady died in 1961 , Mary Kay sought to buy the formula for her new company . In 1963 , she finally succeeded in buying it from the granddaughter of the inventor , devised the marketing plan , and on Friday the 13th , September , 1963 , " Beauty by Mary Kay " was born . She opened a modest shop in 500 square feet of space in Exchange Park , a development west of downtown Dallas that seemed certain to boom . It already had a bank building and another tower that housed the administrative offices of Braniff International . Five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down the mall where Mary Kay 's salon was located . " We had to entice those women to get them to come in , " Mary Kay said . " They had half an hour for lunch , so they wanted in 20 minutes a facial that usually took an hour . We ended up using an electric fan to dry the magic masque so they could get a facial during their coffee break . " The firm started with $5,000 of Mary Kay 's money ; she was so unaware of business practices thatshe did n't even know how to borrow money for it . It started small , and in some ways , the business practices are still small today . For example , people who are asked to have demonstrations and sales parties in their homes are urged not to have more than six women attend , while most companies operating this way want 25 . " We want each woman to leave this meeting with her personal beauty problems answered , and we assume that they do not know anything about make-up , " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who just watch do not buy , so we urge all the ladies to apply the make-up . " When Mary Kay instituted a six-month program at Golden Acres , a Dallas home for the elderly , it was so successful that today the firm gives away almost $500,000 in cosmetics every year to nursing homes across the nation . She describes her success as " gradual , based on the fact that I gave women the ultimate chance to do whatever they were smart enough to do . I believe you can praise people to success . " The visible , personal touches have been a great asset . Mary Kay personally designs a birthday card to be sent to each of the 150,000 independent consultants each year and it always gets there on the right day . Those who have reached a higher plateau  --  the 3,000 " directors " ? receive a gift as well . Almost all are women , but recently a man in Vancouver , British Columbia , Rob Peden , was crowned King of Sales for all of Canada . When Mary Kay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , it creates a stir . Nobody , not even the newest file clerk , calls her anything but Mary Kay . At the national sales meeting , where honors are bestowed , the crowd is so big that it fills the Dallas Convention Center . As Mary Kay steps to the microphone , there is a stir and then a sweeping quietude , as though an invocation were about to be offered . Still , she clearly does not endorse the idea of being remote , untouchable and revered . Charlotte Blaine , a secretary to Jennifer Pruitt , Mary Kay 's administrative assistant , felt sure when she first went to work there that everybody would call the top lady " Mrs. Ash . " She was happy to discover that was not the case . " She is very in touch , very down to earth , " Mrs. Blaine said . " Why , she even comes out of her office to putter around in the kitchen and coffee bar we have here  --  and to clean it up . She 's a neatnik . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unusual for Mary Kay to make a rough sketch of each person seated at a meeting in her office . She pencils a diagram and labels each person with his or her first name so she will not make a mistake . Prejudice  --  religion , color or anything else  --  has no place in this pulsating organization . Mary Kay 's father was Catholic , her mother Baptist and her third husband Jewish . One of her employees even sees to it that Mary Kay receives a Buddhist newspaper every week . " Mother sent me to church because she wanted me to have a background of good morality . I attended church regularly all my life , " she said . When she founded Beauty by Mary Kay in 1963 ? later simplified to Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc. ? her second husband was a partner in the business . " After he died , I was by myself with one-half of a company and no idea how to manage it alone . What do you do ? You turn to God , " she said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Prudential , earning $480 a month . Mary Kay offered him $250 a month to help her launch the newcompany , and today he is president and chief executive officer . In 1968 , he was named Man of the Year by the American Marketing Association , the same year Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc. , went public . Even in those early days , when she asked God to be her partner . Mary Kay 's continuing philosophy was : " God first , family second , business third . " She embellishes it with these thoughts : " Where women are concerned , if they have problems at home , they can not function . If they keep faith and family ahead of business needs , then they will have time for a career . " When she was making $11 per week , Mary Kay started tithing as a member of the Baptist Church . Recently , she gave her Dallas church , Prestonwood Baptist . $500,000 to help construct a new building . " When they first asked me to be chairman of the building committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take that job , " she said . " When the entire building committee said I should take it , I told them I would pray about it , and I did . / asked God to give me a sign . " In her office desk is a small book with 12,000 religious quotations . Continued on page 106 Mary Kay continued from page63 Deep in thought and prayer about what to do , Mary Kay turned to a page at random , and the first thing her eyes saw was this : " God does not ask your ability or your inability . He asks only your availability . " That settled the issue . The fund drive for $15 million is to last three years , but in one month almost $4 million was pledged . Mary Kay started by urging all women in the 700-family church to try to raise $1,000 aside from personal income , and a one-day garage sale netted $4,500 . Ladies of the church have even published and are selling a cookbook . In a separate building , built in 1969 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold-glass tower , is the manufacturing and packaging operation of Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc . Row after row of vats hold between 1,600 and 2,300 gallons . Laboratories deal with fragrances and quality control , and much of the operation is computerized and mechanized . Eighteen years ago , there was one storage vat . Today , the structure accommodates four departments  --  warehouse , purchasing , packaging and research labs . It even has a printing set-up to create Mary Kay labels in English , Spanish and French . Pink buses shuttle employees and visitors between this building and the gold tower . Here , every machine that in any way touches a Mary Kay product is dismantled and steam-cleaned every ten hours , the normal work period . Solar energy is used to heat water in this building , the only U.S. site for manufacturing Mary Kay products . Another plant in Canada ships to Australia and Argentina . Even in Dallas , pink Cadillacs and Buicks still get attention on the streets , although they have been around for a long time . It is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topproducers get to use a leased Cadillac for two years and those next in line use a Buick Regal . The first pink Cadillac in Dallas appeared in 1966 when Mary Kay bought a Cadillac painted a usual color and decided to change it . " I showed the salesman some of our make-up and told him to paint the car that color , " she said . " He argued , of course , but it became a sensation . " Pink is not my favorite color , " Mary Kay said . " But when we started the company , everybody had a white-tile bath , and pink-packaged products looked good . So we chose pink and gold because every product should stand out on the shelf . Ours do that , but in a subtle , low-key way . " If staying busy is a tee down the yellow brick road to success , Mary Kay 's will go on and on . By 6 a.m. , she is up and dictating at home . Her administrative assistant , Ms. Pruitt , has two secretaries of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own make-upand is still at the office by 10 a.m . She manages to dabble in the garden of her North Dallas home and to dote on Gigi , her white French poodle , which she refers to as " a fur person . " A collector of cookbooks , Mary Kay had 53 guests for dinner last Thanksgiving and prepared the traditional meal , although the things she prefers to cook are chicken tetrazzini or steaks , baked potatoes and salad . In July of 1980 , Mary Kay lost her third husband , Mel Ash , to whom she had been married 15 years , to cancer . The sorrow of her husband 's illness is one of a number of medical ordeals she has faced . The one that almost ruined her career before it started hap- pened in 1957 when she developed a twitch in her left eye which spread to her forehead and much of the left side of her face . At the time , she was national training director for World Gift , and part of her face was in a constant grimace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest sunglasses she could find , long before they were even fashionable . Finally , a woman at a World Gift training session told her about a Dallas doctor , and Mary Kay made an appointment . There was a two-hour office visit and then a trip to Baylor Hospital in Dallas for tests . The doctor , a neurosurgeon , diagnosed it as a hemifacial spasm because it had continued , even under sedation . The next stop was Dr. James Gardner of the Cleveland ( Ohio ) Clinic on Labor Day in September of 1962 . He had been blunt about the ailment . " It can spread to other senses , " he said , " And you can be immobilized insofar as taste , smell , sight and feeling are concerned . " Mary Kay had gone to Cleveland with plane tickets to four cities in her purse for business trips , because she had thought that , whatever it was , it could be cured quickly . But it turned into an eight-hour operation in which her blood vessels were immobilized ; she had nurses around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The operation worked , and today there is no trace of a blemish on her lovely , symmetrical face . Thinking back to those lean days of 1963 when the women who worked in Exchange Park wanted a facial in 20 minutes , Mary Kay Ash never envisioned the degree of success in store for her . " Nobody could imagine something like that . I feel like a kid looking in a Christmas window , " she said . " All I had was the tremendous desire to help people . I never thought our business would get out of Dallas . " Nancy Tietjen had been supporting herself and her two daughters by working 54 hours a week as a shotgun-shell packer . She became a beauty consultant for Mary Kay Cosmetics in October , 1971 , a sales director the following December and a national sales director in June of 1975 . The average income of the 24 such sales directors is about $144,000 a year . " Every woman deserves the best , " says Nancy , " and since joining Mary Kay Cosmetics with its quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be beautiful . That is what Mary Kay has given me  --  and countless others : Confidence . Money . Recognition . Prizes . Also , many friends , including the chairman of the board , whom I love like a sister . " Almost from the beginning , Helen McVoy of Dallas has sold Mary Kay products . For 15 years , including 1980 , she has been the company 's top volume producer , and last year she made $242,000 . Last February alone , her check was for $40,000 as one of 24 national sales directors . " I never worked before in my life , except for six months as a secretary , " Mrs. McVoy said . " And I quit just before I got fired . " She calls her entry into the cosmetics field " a fluke . " When a friend asked her to lunch , she thought the woman had had a face lift , but discovered she had simply used Mary Kay products . " I was 45 then and playing a lot of golf . My skin was burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a tight budget at our house that I could n't even buy all the ivy I wanted . I started using and selling Mary Kay products , just working two hours a week . My original investment was for a demonstration case , and I made $17,000 the first year . " As Mary Kay Cosmetics , Inc. , grew , so grew Helen McVoy and Nancy Tietjen . If success is measured by mathematics , the answer is there  --  stock values that have tripled since 1980 , selling on the New York Stock Exchange at more than $65 per share , and a recent stock split . Mary Kay Ash herself could scarcely express it better than the words chosen by her top producer , Helen McVoy : " The theory behind the enormous success of this business is based on a number of things , but one stands out : helping others to help themselves . " And in her upcoming book , Mary Kay , the author of all this success defines her philosophy . " ' You can do it ! ' is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay . " So often a woman comes to us who desperately needs to hear that . Frequently she is a housewife who has been out of the job market for many years , or who has never worked outside the home . " When I see a woman like this , I want to do for her what nobody did for me , in the way of providing opportunities .... We make sure she learns the necessary skills . We encourage her to improve her appearance so she looks the part of a beauty consultant . " And when she does that , she begins to improve in other ways , too . Her confidence builds . She becomes more efficient and begins to set goals . Very often a Mary Kay career is a self-improvement and a way of life  --  not just a way to earn money . "
