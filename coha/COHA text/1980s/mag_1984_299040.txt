Hart lives again as Mondale stumbles in the Midwest <P> The invitation read , " Help put Fritz over the top . " Balloons floated , booze flowed and the band played as hundreds of Mondale supporters jammed the Sheraton Washington Hotel last week to celebrate the beginning of the end of the Democratic race . Inquiring reporters were told to expect an early victory statement at 8 o'clock . At 9 p.m. , Campaign Manager Robert Beckel assured the faithful : " We 're on our way . It 's only a matter of time now . " <P> But the time dragged . Small groups began to cluster around TV sets . Campaign workers whispered anxiously among themselves . Still no candidate , still no statement . Finally , a few minutes after 11 p.m. , Walter Mondale waded slowly through the now diminished crowd , family and entourage in tow . His face was weary , his voice flat and somber . " I know we 're going to win this , " he insisted . " I know we 're going to be elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If so , it was hardly apparent from the results of " Super Tuesday II . " Mondale did win solidly in North Carolina ( 36% to Gary Hart 's 30% and Jesse Jackson 's 25% ) and Maryland ( 43% to Jackson 's 27% and Hart 's 25% ) . But Hart came back from the brink to upset Mondale twice , in the key Midwestern states of Ohio ( 42% to 40% ) and Indiana ( 42% to 41% ) . " Welcome to the fourth quarter , " Hart told a jubilant throng of his supporters at Washington 's National Press Club . " The message is clear . The Democrats and the people of this country are not prepared to have this contest and debate end at this time . " <P> Hart 's analysis was closer to the mark than Mondale 's . Still , the results were less a victory for the challenger than a defeat for the front runner . The former Vice President remains the odds-on favorite to win the nomination . But party chiefs fear that by the time he raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will have taken so many blows from his opponents he will be punch-drunk . Says Iowa Democratic Committee Chairman David Nagle : " If Hart sweeps the rest , Mondale 's going to be a badly wounded duck trying to fly home . " <P> With perverse consistency , voters seem to slap Mondale down every time he appears to have the nomination within his grasp . Having derailed Mondale 's " juggernaut " in New Hampshire , they briefly admired him as an aggressive underdog struggling back . But after Mondale regained the role of front runner , he began behaving like one again , calling for party unity and looking ahead to the contest against Ronald Reagan . To the voters , he was no longer " Fighting Fritz . " Once again he was what one party insider calls " Mondale Inc. , " the buttoned-up Establishment candidate who sells shares of himself to interest groups .
