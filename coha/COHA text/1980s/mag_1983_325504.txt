An odd peace offensive <P> All along the main highway north of Kabul , Soviet and Afghan air and ground artillery bombardments rained down on guerrilla positions . Earlier , Soviet helicopter gunships and fighter-bombers had pounded Charikar , the capital of Parwan province , and villages in the nearby Kheyr Khaneh Pass , sending thousands of refugees into the capital city of Kabul . Those who were able to flee across the border into Pakistan called last week 's attacks the heaviest since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . After the attacks , Soviet helicopters dropped leaflets saying " Peace is on the way . " <P> Washington publicly deplored the " extremely heavy , brutal and prolonged " Soviet bombing of rebel regions , and repeated the U.S. desire " to see Afghanistan 's agony brought to an end through Soviet troop withdrawal as part of a negotiated settlement . " Western military analysts in Pakistan said that the Soviets may be trying to soften up their withdrawal routes for the time when a pullout is arranged . But Moscow was hardly taking any chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet troops , along with ground and air support , were reportedly massed in preparation for a maneuver to seal off the border with Pakistan . <P> The northern Pakistani city of Peshawar , which serves as headquarters for the Afghan rebels , was rife with rumors last week that some kind of deal was about to be worked out between the Soviet-installed regime of Afghan President Babrak Karmal and the government of Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq . Diplomats from the two countries , have been meeting in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations in an attempt to negotiate an agreement , but the rebels are opposed to the talks on the grounds that they are not represented . <P> Pakistan has good reason to hope for a solution to the 3-year-old conflict , which has sent 3 million Afghan refugees , many of them heavily armed , streaming across the border . Pakistan recently ordered the guerrillas to move out of Peshawar and into more remote regions closer to the Afghan border . In an attempt to reassure the rebels , Zia said last week that Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political solution had been achieved . <P> In preparation for the next round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan , which are set to begin in Geneva in June , U.N . Under Secretary General Diego Cordovez has been trying to put together a comprehensive plan . It would include 1 ) the withdrawal of the 105,000 Soviet troops now in Afghanistan , 2 ) the repatriation of the Afghan refugees in Pakistan and an additional million who are in Iran , and 3 ) a guarantee of Afghanistan 's right to self-determination without external interference in its internal affairs . Last month , Cordovez declared that an accord was " 95% in the bag , " but he may have been overly optimistic . Says a U.S. State Department specialist : " We do not see the Soviets leaving a volatile situation behind , and we do not see any Afghan government , even a coalition , acceptable to them that would not face continued resistance from the people .
