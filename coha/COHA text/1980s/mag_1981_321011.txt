The death of a chairman <P> Continental Airlines Chairman Alvin Lindbergh Feldman , 53 , worked for several hours with an aide Sunday , Aug. 9 , in his office at the Los Angeles International Airport . The two men were preparing a press release to be published the next day announcing that nine banks had pulled out of a plan aimed at stopping a Texas International Airlines takeover of the company . The banks had changed their minds about making a $185 million loan to a group of about 11,000 employees who wanted to buy controlling interest in their ailing company . Without the loans , the takeover seemed inevitable . After finishing work , Feldman sat alone and wrote four letters : two to his attorneys , one to his three grown children , in which he mentioned the death of their mother last year , and one to his secretary telling her what to do with the other three letters . Then Alvin Feldman shot himself . <P> The Continental chairman had built up a reputation as one of the top executives in the airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Seawell offered Feldman the Pan Am presidency , but Feldman declined . During nine years as chairman of Denver-based Frontier Airlines in the 1970s , Feldman transformed that carrier from a major loser to a consistent moneymaker by paring unprofitable routes , streamlining management and restructuring its flight operations . <P> When Feldman took over Continental in early 1980 , it was a troubled airline . Although it had a good network of domestic and international flights , Continental had never fully recovered from a long strike in 1976 . The company lost $13 million in 1979 , more than $20 million in 1980 and $34.7 million for the first half of this year . Like many other carriers , Continental was also suffering from the tough competition set off by the deregulation of the airline industry and the high cost of jet fuel . <P> A merger looked like a good move , and Feldman started talking to Western Airlines , a regional carrier that flies in 15 states west of the Mississippi , Canada and Mexico . The two companies tried to merge in 1979 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a deal would reduce air competition on the West Coast . But in March the CAB changed its decision and gave Continental and Western the go-ahead . <P> Then , just as the merger was about to take place , Texas International , led by its aggressive chairman Francisco Lorenzo , moved against Continental . Texas International had previously made unfriendly takeover bids on National Airlines and TWA . <P> Lorenzo quickly acquired 48.5% of Continental 's stock . In one hectic day of trading , he bought 830,000 shares of Continental just 30 min. before the market closed . The Continental-Western merger was dead , and a bitter takeover battle between Continental and Texas International was under way . In April two veteran Continental pilots proposed that company workers buy a majority of the firm 's stock through an employee stock-ownership plan . Though skeptical of the plan at first , Feldman soon threw his support behind it in a last-ditch effort to stop Texas International . Lorenzo immediately challenged the legality of the plan . But the courts rejected his case . Continental employees still had hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . "
