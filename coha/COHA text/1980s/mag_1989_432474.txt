 | With the flick of an ankle , TV 's bumbling secret agent Maxwell Smart could pick up his shoe and dial himself out of a jam . Today , cellular is a $3 billion business , and it is the nation 's 25 major service providers that are falling over themselves , signing up subscribers and swallowing up rivals . Like cable TV and VCR 's , mobile phones have moved into the mainstream . Costs for both equipment and service are dropping dramatically . Car sets that averaged $2,000 five years ago can be had for as little as $200 , while off-peak rates have halved monthly bills to $120 . The discounts have spurred sales ; more than 2 million Americans are now hooked into cellular systems , a 68 percent increase over last year . Success has spawned a spate of takeovers , including a recent $6.2 billion hostile bid by McCaw Cellular Communications , the nation 's largest mobile-phone concern , for New York-based Lin Broadcasting Corporation . Netting the fifth-largest telecommunications firm would make McCaw the only cellular network with nationwide service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive executive toys only five years ago , mobile phones have become a vital tool for working stiffs from plumbers to drug dealers . Five years ago , the typical user was male , over 55 years of age and earned upward of $60,000 a year , reports Jim Gerace , a spokesman for Nynex Mobile Communications in New York City . Today , one quarter of subscribers are women , ages range from 35 to 55 and income is often as low as $35,000 . In Upstate New York , farmer James Webb uses his set to call wholesalers from the cornfield and determine how many ears to cut for market . Portable phones let Maryland developer Harvey Spa run his company while cruising the Potomac River and link far-flung sales forces with their headquarters . Even some Manhattan taco vendors have gone cellular . Analysts predict that by 1995 the ranks of mobilephone users could top 20 million , or one tenth the number of those using the regular phone system . Infrastructure costs are high , however , and many cellular systems are running in the red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Herschel Shosteck Associates , a consulting firm in Silver Spring , Md. , as of last December , 26 percent of new-phone purchases were by private buyers . And a recent Nynex study reveals that even among corporate subscribers , 60 percent spend half their phone time on personal calls . Many executives buy mobile phones as a safety feature for the family car , and both Ford and Chevrolet plan to offer cellular options in next year 's models . Cellular owes much of its explosive growth to a combination of technology and pricing . Each service area consists of a series of radio-tower sites , or cells , that relay mobile calls to a central computer switch and into the regular phone networks . Carriers have spent over $3.2 billion so far to expand their systems , which now cover all metropolitan areas and 75 percent of the U.S. population . Lotteries for rural-market franchises promise to create a seamless nationwide mobilephone network . As systems spring up , so does new equipment . Hand-held sets that once cost $3,000 now sell for $600 . These portables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.7-ounce Micro TAC , can  | be adapted easily for automobile use . And while they represent just 10 percent of mobile-phone sales , they are expected to overtake the market as prices continue to drop . Additional improvements promise to further broaden cellular 's appeal . With pocket-size phones , train commuters will be able to tap into computer databanks , while car sets may one day include fax machines , real-time traffic information and alarm systems that pinpoint the auto 's location and alert police in case of an accident . " Cellular technology is limited only by the imagination , " says Piyush Sodha , a director of cellular systems at Northern Telecom . Certainly there has been no lack of spark on Wall Street , where cellular 's profit potential has boosted share prices by as much as 58 percent over the past 24 months . Last week , McCaw saw stock values rise $1.50 to $40.25 after upping its $110-a-share offer for Lin to $127.50 in cash and securities . If successful , the tug of war would nearly double the Kirkland , Wash. , firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage to such key metropolitan areas as San Francisco , Miami and Philadelphia ? a prospect valuable enough to prompt McCaw to pay around $300 for each potential customer . That is twice what British Telecommunications spent per subscriber when it bought a 22 percent chunk of McCaw last January , in a bid that was considered a 40 percent premium over market value at the time . High rollers . Cellular investments are not for the fainthearted . Soaring share prices reflect projections of cash flows as much as five years into the future , rather than present revenues . Shares of regional Bell companies are considered a safe bet , since their cellular operations are still undervalued , say analysts , but prices of totally cellular concerns may already be too high . Many cellular-service providers remain in the red , having invested billions in infrastructure . McCaw , for instance , is $2 billion in debt , though that has not interfered with the company 's buying binge . " The companies doing the best job are those losing the most money , " observes consultant Shosteck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure for short-term earnings and shortchange investments . **25;1328;TOOLONG revenues are expected to climb to $4.4 billion by 1990 . But costs are bound to rise , too , as more companies fight to buy a shrinking number of properties . In rural areas , for example , providers may end up paying more to acquire licenses than to build systems . Some of the cost pressure may ease with the introduction of new technology . Last January , the industry agreed to a shift from analog radio waves to digital , a move that will increase calling capacity by as much as 1,000 percent by the year 2000 . With further advancements to smaller cells , as many as 35,000 subscribers per square mile can be served by cellular , up from a maximum of 1,500 with today 's analog system . Digital technology allows massive economies of scale that could make mobile phones as common as conventional ones ; service providers who now spend between $750 and $1,000 for each new subscriber will see those costs fall by half , while consumers could shave phone bills by as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people " will start to associate a telephone with a person rather than a place , " says Geoffrey Johnson of Argus Research . After the dust settles from the buying-and-building frenzy , industry analysts forecast a period of oat enormous consolidation . With the exception of McCaw , which will offer nationwide service , superregional Bells will dominate the industry . " Fifteen or 20 companies will control 90 percent of the business , " predicts consultant Shosteck . All have been avid buyers and builders of cellular properties as a way of hedging against any erosion in their traditional customer base . The Baby Bells enjoy a leg up on cellular rivals because they bought into mobile services early , when franchise costs were lower , and thus can capture customers for less . PacTel , for instance , has paid an average of $16 for each potential subscriber in its service areas vs . McCaw 's nearly $300-per-head offer for Lin . Still , cellular 's future is far from certain . Growth could be curtailed by persistent quality problems , such as dead spots caused when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between systems and eavesdropping still trouble many users . Those snags are partly responsible for the fact that 30 percent of subscribers drop mobile-phone service annually . A change in regulation could also imperil cellular providers . The Federal Communications Commission set up duopolies in each cellular market , which tends to stabilize prices , but deregulation would usher in new players , perhaps unleashing an all-out price war . Even worse , a recession could topple debt-laden cellular providers such as McCaw . Cellular has many subscribers in the construction and real-estate industries , which are especially sensitive to economic downturns . And mobile phones remain somewhat of a luxury to many users , the first thing to go when times get tough . Even so , Denver , with one of the worst economies in the country , saw cellular climb by 25 percent last year . Cellular fans are quick to point out that today 's luxury will rapidly become tomorrow 's necessity . After all , such staples of modern life as land-line telephones were all but dismissed when first introduced . But skeptics have examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
