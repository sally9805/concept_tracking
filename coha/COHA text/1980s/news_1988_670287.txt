Merv Griffin declined to extend the deadline for agreements related to his proposed acquisition of Resorts International Inc. , intensifying speculation about whether the deal will go through . Although the agreements remain in effect , the move by Mr. Griffin gives him greater leeway should he decide to try to revise or terminate them , including a $36-a-share offer for Resorts ' Class A shares . In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , the Class A shares plunged $4. 875 to close at $29. 125 in heavy volume of 420 , 900 shares . " We have not terminated the deal , " said Thomas Gallagher , an attorney for Mr. Griffin . Mr. Gallagher added , however , that Mr. Griffin hadn ' t decided whether to terminate the agreements . Mr. Griffin ' s Griffin Co. said in a news release that it hadn ' t further extended the Oct. 7 deadline for completing the acquisition of Resorts , an Atlantic City , N.J.based operator of hotels and casinos . The deadline had been a provision in various agreements related to the multi-faceted transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman and the owner of most of the company ' s supervoting Class B shares . Attorneys for both sides agreed that the expiration of the deadline alone doesn ' t terminate the transaction . " The deal doesn ' t automatically go off , " said Jack Nusbaum , an attorney for Mr. Trump . " The deal only goes off if one side says it ' s off . " But the lack of a new deadline creates more uncertainty in the transaction , which still depends on regulatory approvals and other conditions . Previously , Mr. Griffin extended deadlines five times . " It ' s obviously been going on a long time , " Mr. Gallagher said of Mr. Griffin ' s efforts to acquire Resorts . He added that " events have a way of overtaking you , " but wouldn ' t speculate about what obstacles might yet arise . Mr. Nusbaum said he knew of no obstacles and hadn ' t been approached by the Griffin camp about any more changes it would like to make in the transaction . Mr. Griffin also declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . Griffin Co. said continuing the offer served " no useful purpose " since Resorts ' holders have already approved a cash merger at $36 a share for the Class A shares . Still , the merger agreement had previously included an Oct. 7 deadline that has now lapsed . A decision on a preliminary New Jersey casino license for Mr. Griffin could come today at a meeting of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission . During recent hearings , the commission expressed concern about the debt Mr. Griffin would assume in the transaction . Mr. Griffin has acknowledged that Resort ' s current cash flow wouldn ' t cover interest costs of the acquisition , although he has said costs could be trimmed to avoid having to sell assets . Under terms of the transaction , Mr. Griffin would pay $205 million for the Class A shares and $96 million for Mr. Trump ' s Class B shares . Mr. Griffin has also agreed to sell Resorts ' Taj Mahal hotel-casino in Atlantic City to Mr. Trump for about $273 million , far below the $467 million Resorts had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . A spokeswoman for the state attorney general ' s office has said recent changes in the terms of the transaction eased its concerns about the debt Mr. Griffin would incur . David Leibowitz , an analyst with American Securities Corp. , said that a recent Internal Revenue Service ruling that the Griffin camp has called favorable to the transaction might nevertheless have prompted a new look at potential cash flow at Resorts and given Mr. Griffin second thoughts . Marvin Roffman , an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. , noted that other developments in Atlantic City , such as a plan by Golden Nugget Inc. to operate a casino offering gamblers better odds , could step up the competition for Resorts . Messrs . Leibowitz and Roffman emphasized that they could offer only surmise in the absence of more information from Mr. Griffin .
