" Fill ' er up ! " In these days of buck-a-gallon gasoline , millions of + Americans belt out those words with relish in filling stations from Honolulu to Hartford . But the cost of that tankful could soon take its biggest leap since the oil-parched 1970s . Reason : a hefty increase in the federal gasoline tax may be coming down the road this year . To an increasing number of politicians and economists , a gas-tax boost would be one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce the 1990 budget deficit . The idea could quickly gain ground among congressional leaders who are preparing to haggle with the incoming Bush Administration over steps to stanch the red ink . " It seems everybody has decided that a higher gasoline tax is the answer , " says Susan Simon , a Washington political analyst for Wall Street 's Shearson Lehman Hutton . <P> Not quite . Opponents of boosting the 9.1 cents-per-gal. federal tax are gearing up for a fierce lobbying brawl . On one side stand the influential but unorganized advocates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenspan to Illinois Democrat Dan Rostenkowski , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . They argue that a gas-tax boost  --  the proposals span from about 7 cents per gal . to 50 cents  --  would be simple to administer and would bring a gusher of new revenues . As fringe benefits , the tax would help the environment and the U.S. trade position . <P> On the opposing side , marching beneath such catchy acronyms as FUEL ( Fuel Users for Equitable Levies ) and TRIP ( The Road Information Program ) , are some unlikely fellow travelers . Among them : the American Petroleum Institute , which represents big oil companies , and Americans for Democratic Action , a left-wing organization that rates public office holders on their support for liberal issues . Both groups contend that a gas-tax increase would unfairly burden lower-income motorists because they spend a higher proportion of their income on fuel than better-off drivers do . The opponents are joined by state legislators , who fear that a higher federal levy would squeeze their ability to raise more revenues through their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . <P> The tax issue is dividing the regions . Opposition is fierce in sprawling Western states , where some motorists routinely drive 75 miles  --  often at 75 m.p.h.  --  to shop or see a doctor . According to a study by the American Automobile Association , which strongly opposes an increase , raising the levy would hit Wyoming the hardest of any state . The A.A.A. estimated that a 50 * cents-per-gal. increase , which is at the high end in the range of proposals , would cost the typical Wyoming motorist $412 a year . New Yorkers would pay $282 more and Washington drivers an additional $198 . Says Doug Todd , a Republican state senator in Arizona : " We ought to have a lynching party standing by , and if that Eastern bunch of spendthrifts gets it passed , hang a few of ' em from the nearest on ramp .
