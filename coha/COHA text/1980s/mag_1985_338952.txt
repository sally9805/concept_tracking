" This is a sad and difficult day for E.F . Hutton and for me personally , " said a subdued Robert Fomon , chairman and chief executive of Wall Street 's fifth-largest brokerage firm . Hours before Fomon appeared at a press conference in New York City last week , Hutton President Scott Pierce had pleaded guilty on behalf of the firm to 2,000 separate criminal charges of mail and wire fraud . After accepting Pierce 's pleas in a Scranton , Pa. , courtroom , Federal Judge William Nealon fined Hutton the maximum $1,000 on each charge , or a total of $2 million . Never before had a prestigious Wall Street investment group acknowledged such a major fraud . <P> The charge made last week by Attorney General Edwin Meese was that Hutton had used a sophisticated method of check kiting to avoid high interest rates . Kiting is a procedure in which two or more checking accounts are played off against each other to stay one step ahead of a bounced check . After overdrawing an account at one bank , a person or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdraws an account on another bank . With some quick moves , it is possible to stay just ahead of the bankers and in effect obtain an interest-free , short-term loan . <P> In the case of E.F . Hutton , executives deposited funds in local banks and then wrote checks for sums greater than the amounts in the accounts . Those were then covered a few days later by checks from other Hutton branches . In addition , 83 Hutton offices were involved in multiple transfers that moved money among a series of banks on its way between Hutton offices . As much as $10 billion was involved over a 20-month period starting in July 1980 , during which time short-term interest rates rose to more than 20% . Thus the practices provided E.F . Hutton with interest-free loans of as much as $250 million a day . <P> At least 400 commercial banks were affected by the transactions , some of them small rural banks so eager for Hutton deposits that they might have been inclined to ignore doubtful practices . In addition to the $2 million fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside a reserve to pay the banks the missing interest , which could amount to $8 million or more . <P> No individuals were named in last week 's charges or identified by the company , even though the Hutton branch managers benefited because they were given bonuses equal to 10% of their branch profits . That immediately raised charges of Justice Department favoritism toward Big Business . Meese lamely attempted to explain his decision not to go after any Hutton employees , saying it was necessary to give immunity " to push the investigation along . " He added , " It did n't seem fair to subsequently charge other individuals for doing identical acts . " <P> Hutton 's Fomon last week stressed that no customer or client lost any money as a result of the illegal transactions . Even so , a brokerage house that gathered considerable eminence with its " When E.F . Hutton talks , people listen " advertising campaigns had swiftly lost some prestige .
