When Sony Chairman Akio Morita unveiled in 1981 a prototype of the first camera to capture images on electronic sensors rather than on film , he billed it the greatest breakthrough since Daguerre 's silver-coated copper photographic plate . With Sony 's still-video camera , photographers could instantly display their snapshots on ordinary TV screens . But when it finally came out in 1987 with a price tag of about $7,000 , the product did not exactly overwhelm the marketplace . Except in a few specialized applications in business and journalism , the filmless camera virtually disappeared . <P> Now Japan 's camera makers are ready to try again , this time with improved technology and prices aimed at a broader consumer market . At the Photo Marketing Association 's big annual trade show in Dallas this week , Sony and Canon will introduce a pair of palm-size , lightweight still-video cameras that will sell for less than $1,000 . Each model can take and store up to 50 shots on erasable , reusable 2-in. floppy disks . When plugged into a television set , the new systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . They are expected to arrive in U.S. stores this spring , and before the year is out they could be joined by models from Konica and Fuji . <P> All still-video cameras operate on the same basic principle . Light passes through a lens and strikes a flat electronic wafer called a charge-coupled device , which converts the image into electronic signals that are stored on a floppy disk in the same manner that a camcorder records the individual frames of a video movie . Once an image has been captured , it can be displayed on a TV , printed on paper or transmitted over telephone lines anywhere in the world . But whoever receives the images must have one of the cameras or other special equipment to view the pictures . <P> It is the ability to store and transmit images that has made still-video technology attractive to professionals , from architects to fashion photographers . Real estate brokers , for example , use it to show pictures of houses to clients in distant cities . Among the biggest consumers have been news organizations , which use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions . When the Oscar for best picture is awarded in late March , USA Today plans to capture the moment with a professional Sony still-video system and transmit the pictures to printing plants in minutes . The shots will not be as sharp as those taken by conventional cameras , but , as Frank Folwell , the publication 's assistant director of photography , puts it , " for a newspaper with a deadline to meet , it 's the alternative to having no picture at all . " <P> The availability of new , cheaper models is likely to spur sales in business markets , but whether the technology will be attractive to the ordinary shutterbug is an open question . Proponents argue that still videos are simpler to store than slides or color prints and more easily edited than videotapes . The manufacturers envision video-generation consumers exchanging floppy disks by mail and giving video slide shows to friends and relatives . Says Sony 's Hiroshi Yasuo : " We believe it will become a big business . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
