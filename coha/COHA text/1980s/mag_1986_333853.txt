It is late Christmas Eve , the tree is up and listing at something less than 15 degrees . Not perfect , but acceptable . The kids will sleep until dawn . Insufficient but unavoidable . The pres- ents are wrapped , all but that one saved for last . A favorite . One that should be freshly assembled and brightly functioning when the kids charge into the room in . . . can it be just five hours ? <P> Grab an eggnog and ( anticipating technical problems ) a few elementary tools , then sit down with Spacewarp . Picture on the box looks great . Grinning boys watching steel marbles roll over course that resembles a Disney World ride for reckless ball bearings . Open the instruction book . And  --  the horror ! the horror !  --  it looks like something from J. Robert Oppenheimer 's sketchbook . Maybe the words of Johann Stonehouse , national sales and distribution manager for Bandai America , will soothe : " You 're not getting your money 's worth if it 's not hard . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family project . " There ! That 's it ! Family project . Just the thing to work on with the children and perhaps , too , with some holiday phone help from Cousin Jonas , who has , among other sterling qualities , full tenure at M.I.T. <P> So wrap Spacewarp , settle down with another eggnog and consider the bounty under the tree . The regenerating myths of toys may have as many classical permutations as the collective unconscious , but the listings in most contemporary toy catalogs can be reduced to three basics . Spacewarp , for example , falls into a category that could be called . . . build it . <P> Here is where modernism and tradition meet as snugly as two curved tracks in a set of electric trains . It is a given that this is an age of futurism and intricacy in toys , and indeed some Transformers are wondrous and devilish at once . The Decepticon Trypticon ( about $56 ) is a gray , green and purple animated dinosaur that turns  --  with some flips , tucks and fast snaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Toy &; Hobby World 's Toy Hit Parade ) have lots of modern dash , but electric trains still have romance enough to lure any kid away from a video game . Purists note that Lionel may not be all it once was , but the H-O gauge lines of Marklin and Roco , Lima and Liliput , chug as reliably as ever , and the large-scale LGBs , made in West Germany , could be the grandest toy trains ever . A starter set ( about $330 ) with a steam locomotive and two passenger cars is a richly detailed invitation to further excursions that can be plotted from the elaborate LGB catalog , which is a real itinerary for dreaming all on its own . <P> Childcraft 's superb sets of large wooden blocks ( ranging from $35 to $200 ) are crafted to be the foundation not only of manual skill but of imaginative construction that older kids can carry forward into Fisher-Price 's excellent $5-to-$38 Construx sets . These will yield an armada from outer space that &; might handily be reinforced by some vehicle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formidable Giant " vertical climbing system , " a rumbling series of interlocking rough-roaders ( scant assembly required ) that can make it over cartons and well up walls .
