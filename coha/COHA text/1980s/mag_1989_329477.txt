Since June a band of thieves in the Los Angeles area has staged more than 30 violent raids on travel agencies . The gang demands blank tickets and the validation plates that print airline identifications , then sells thousands of hot tickets on the black market at a 50% discount . During heists in recent weeks , two female employees were raped , one agent was knifed and another killed . <P> Because the plates carry the code of each travel agency , businesses are being billed for a slew of stolen tickets , many of them to expensive locations in Central and South America . One agency was debited $47,000 for tickets taken last June . The local chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents has asked airlines to install $1,500 computer scanners at boarding gates to identify the hot tickets . Three weeks ago , when thieves held up Van Nuys travel agent Alfredo Vaca for the second time , he refused to surrender any more blanks , convinced that the losses would put him out of business . The robbers shot him dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
