cedes she does n't know whether what she says is divine or Danuta . But then , " Harvey in Chicago who had that tumor on his face will call in and say it 's gone , " she says . ' At 11:30 , after the show 's closing theme is played , Danuta and Ben talk briefly and " have some fun " with the audience before leaving the studio . In the afternoon , Danuta says , " anything can happen . " One day she might be flying to Missouri with a film crew to interview John Testrake , the pilot of the hijacked TWA flight 847 . Another afternoon she might jet to New York to interview Yitzhak Shamir , ( then ) prime minister of Israel , at a posh hotel . On other days Danuta will return to her cozy office after lunch and attempt to catch up on the stack of current-event magazines on her desk or to dive into one of the six books she is currently reading . Not all Danuta 's reading is work related , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also reading The Brothers Karamazov " for fun , " she says , laughing . Laughter and unpredictability are Danuta 's hallmarks as a television personality , but her ability to ask questions , both on and off camera , distinguishes her as a broadcast journalist . " I could interview a stone and make sense of it , " she says . Danuta has interviewed such national figures as Jeane Kirkpatrick , Edwin Meese , Bob Dole and George Bush ; she has been described by the Chicago Tribune as a " tough , incisive interviewer . " On the " 700 Club " she is afforded the unique opportunity to ask questions not often asked , questions about the spiritual and moral dimension of people in public life . Danuta says one of the most candid and delightful responses she has received came during her interview with Shamir . Does the prime minister of Israel ever pray ? she asked . Glancing up from under his bushy eyebrows , Shamir answered directly yet enigmatically : " Sometimes . " Shamir went on to relate wistfully that he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration . Danuta often directs her inquiries to Pat Robertson . In fact , Robertson 's book Answers to 200 of Life 's Most Probing Questions was basedon 20 hours of questions and answers between Danuta and Pat in a recording studio . In high school Danuta set her sights on a career in broadcast journalism . She considered going into law , oceanography or medicine but " underneath it all " harbored a strong desire to become an actress . The difficulty with acting ? " I could n't see myself going to school to study drama just to become a waitress for the rest of my life , " she relates . Danuta wanted something more cerebral than the life of a waitress-actor . Broadcast journalism allowed her , she discovered , both to be on stage and to use her journalistic talent . " So it all sort of came together for me , " she says . Danuta headed to Colorado after high-school graduation to study communications at the University of Colorado . But academics were n't the only item on Danuta 's agenda there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . ( In fact , Danuta has skied almost all her life . Her father , a 1936 Olympic participant for Poland , fitted her with a pair of skis when she first began to walk . ) Danuta left a masters program in philosophy and journalism at Colorado to become the first female camera operator in Phoenix . " They did n't think women could do that sort of work in those days , " she says . After two years in Phoenix , she went to San Francisco and looked for her big break . There she was hired by a news service to give radio ski reports for 30 California radio stations . Rather than merely recite temperature , snow depth and wind and weather conditions , Danuta spiced up her ski reports . " My personality invaded everything I did , " she says . " A typical report would begin , ' Hi , this is your California snow bunny , and the snow up here is just terrible . But that 's O.K. , because you can come up here and ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danuta , offered work as a radio news reporter in San Diego , soon became the cohost of " Sun-Up San Diego , " a morning television talk show . Danuta appeared on " Sun-Up " for five years . While there she entertained audiences with the same flair and excitement that have made her popular with " 700 Club " viewers . Dustin Hoffman , for instance , sat on her lap while she interviewed him , and Charlton Heston asked her to call him Chuck . While Danuta was making her living asking other people questions , she was also asking questions about her own life . But she was shocked to discover one summer evening that her questions were " not important . " The revelation came after she had spent three hours in a hard-nosed interrogation of an evangelist , Harald Bredesen , at his home in Escondido , California . Bredesen had been asked to speak about Christianity to Danuta 's philosophy discussion group , part of her search for religious truth . Danuta had already investigated tarot cards , the I Ching and transcendental meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nairishirin Daishonen . " I 'd come into the news room every day with something different , " Danuta recalls . Once , after a conversation the length of a ski-lift ride , she became convinced that eating indigenous seeds was the way to find truth . On Bredesen 's patio , dark after three hours , Danuta was beginning another question when she heard a voice announce , " Your questions are not important . " Perturbed and angered , she asked who had spoken . No one in the group had . Despite the importance the questions had to her , Danuta suddenly realized the futility of trying to attain absolute knowledge before making a commitment to Christianity . Just then Bredesen leaned over the table and asked , " Are you ready to have Jesus Christ in your life tonight ? " Without hesitation Danuta answered , " Yes . " After her conversion , Danuta became frustrated at " Sun-Up San Diego . " " I was taking up time and space entertaining people with vacuous , innocuous details that did n't mean anything to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed when her cohost , Jerry Bishop , recounted his dream that she was on a national-television talk showfor Jesus Christ . Danuta had no intention of becoming involved with religious broadcasting , which to her had a " fuddy-duddy image . " Her ambition was to join ABC , NBC or CBS as a newswoman . Three days later a woman Danuta had never met walked up to Danuta sunbathing on a beach . The woman told Danuta her husband had dreamed he and his son were walking up a long staircase to meet a religious leader . At the top , instead of a bearded rabbi in a long robe , stood Danuta . Confused about what meaning , if any , the dreams had , Danuta went back to talk to Bredesen . He suggested she send the " 700 Club " an audition tape and a cover letter explaining the dreams . Although Danuta had never heard of the program , she sent the materials . Nine months passed without a response . Finally , in March 1983 , an apologetic CBN executive called Danuta to invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadjust been found unopened when an employee cleaned out a desk . Danuta went for the audition ; two weeks later she packed up her calico cat and her African violets , said good-by to her friends and to the California palms and left for Virginia Beach , Virginia ( the headquarters of CBN ) , a place she could n't even find on the map , she jokes . Six months after her arrival she married Kai Soderman , a financial consultant with E.F . Hutton . Danuta describes Kai as " considerate , gentle , romantic , fun and funny . I really am married to an exquisite husband , " she says . " He treats me like a queen . " Given her platform as a communicator , Danuta is not without her soapboxes , such as the status of women in the church . " It 's just very annoying to me that there are n't more strong female personalities in the church , " she says . Submission , Danuta believes , has sometimes come continued on page 104 H ow we happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas can be traced to my wife 's birth defect . Where other women have a circulatory system composed of red arteries , blue veins and a heart , my life 's companion was born with a road map  --  red inter-states , blue secondary roads and a self-serve gas pump . As a result , if she is n't packing for a trip it 's only because she has n't had time to do the laundry since unpacking from the previous expedition . How we went to Florida : I had no more than settled on the sofa one night when the phone rang . Wife put down the Eton jacket she was crocheting for the parakeet . " Is that for you ? " she asked . I turned to the dog and responded , " No , it 's an octave too high for me . " It was wife 's mother calling . She would let us have the $1,400 . Thanking her from the bottom , I hung up and turned to the woman who had taken me ( for better or for worse ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After trying the jacket on the parakeet , she said , " Well , Barnyard , after just selling that poem to Liberty for $20 , I thought it would be a good time for you to quit selling ladies ' underwear door-to-door , tap mother for a $1,400 loan to put with that 20 , buy a house trailer and take it to Florida where you can write full-time while you 're on a roll . " And I fell for it . Looking back , I think I must have been in a state of euphoria from selling the poem for that staggering sum . ( I was easily staggered in those days . ) Or maybe it was a lack of oxygen to the brainfrom holding my breath for three hours and trying to influence her to come up with some other way of spending my 20 bucks . Whatever the reason , it was good-by job , good-by house built on a solid foundation and hello house trailer , our future abode perched precariously on two wheels . Now , by house trailer I refer not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm talking about a 28-foot Schultz complete with white-enameled bucket . I 'm talking about a bedroom at the back end , occupied of course by the kids , Michael and Nikki , and at the front end a bedroom/living room/dining room/recreation room/writing room . Connecting them was a squeeze-throughway called a galley . Here , wife would open the can of beans and halve grapefruit for Sunday dinners . Through the week , we would n't eat so well : After only three months in Florida my literary career was rolling at such a pace that I had to either sell the car or ask the family to give up the habit of eating altogether . So we really did n't need the challenge of Christmas to complicate living conditions . The situation already offered everything a pioneer-spirited couple ( make that person ) could ask for . The sofa bed that dominated the bedroom/living room , etc. , offered challenge enough in itself . The bedding was stored beneath the seat , so bedtime procedure called for me to raise the seat and hold it while wife dived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raising the seat higher would then unhinge the back section ; then I could lower them bothand create what had to pass for a bed . There were nights when everything went according to Broyhill . There were other nights when I would turn to help wife spread the bottom sheet , only to find her legs protruding from under the seat section and thrashing madly . On these nights , if it had n't been for name-calling we would have had no conversation at all . There 's nothing like the good-will feeling of the yule season , however , to make a woman forgive and forget the nights she was slow in getting her white meat out from under the seat . There was also the pleasant surprise that in this land where sun and sand had replaced snow shoveling and heart attacks , people still celebrated Christmas  --  even in trailer parks . Now , there 's an old saying . . . so old , as a matter of fact , that I 've forgotten it . No problem ; there are lots of old sayings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome , do as the Romans do . " And what the Romans were doing was decorating the palmetto nearest the front door of their trailers . Wife , as behooves the opposing sex , automatically nixed the idea before I could finish my suggestion that we follow the custom . She was for doing what Michiganders do in Michigan  --  installing a good old genuine , fragrant pine tree . And by bribing the kids before I could get to them , the vote went three for , one opposed . No matter that our Michigan trees had been sold by the tree and these in Florida were priced by the running inch . No matter that our rooms in Michigan sported 12-foot ceilings while in our present coop a 6-foot man could develop round shoulders without half trying . " Over my dead body , " she selected a tree that rangers must have climbed for spotting forest fires . " You pull and I 'll push " was her brilliant solution for cramming the thing through our 21/2-foot doorway . Only you who have tried to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed . Had it not been for the sofa , the ambulance people would have had a real job extracting my head from the opposite wall of the trailer after the two widest limbs snapped off . And only you who have giftwrapped an octopus will appreciate the time we spent weaving the remaining boughs through , under , around and between the furniture . Even then , we were n't out of the woods . There remained the problem of a ten-footplus tree bent beneath a six-foot-minus ceiling . No bomb squad could have treated it with more caution . Finally collecting my wits , some found as far away as the tree lot , removed the screen from the ceiling air vent and threaded some four feet of the topmost branches through it . " Let 's not put up the angel this year , " I proposed , trying to separate my fingers , by now stuck together in one big clump with pine pitch . After the ballot , I borrowed a stepladder and risked life , limb and ridicule of the entire park by climbing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest twig . And was Mrs. Santa now completely satisfied ? You show me how to satisfy a wife completely and I 'll show you how to milk a giraffe while wearing boxing gloves . Oh , she was completely satisfied watching me trying to wedge through the pinery to reach the sofa without undergoing a pine-needle massage from nape to tailbone . And Christmas Eve , when I emerged with icicles decorating my hair , a strand of tinsel draped overone ear and a red light bulb flashing in my hip pocket , I thought she would die laughing . For the sake of the kids , I restrained myself . It was one of those nights , however , that I happened to lower the sofa seat before she had cleared . Christmas morning in a house with separate living room and master bedroom is confusion enough , right ? You should try it in rooms the size of piano packing crates . One thing they have in common  --  the confusion begins at the ghastly hour of five-thirty , give or take . Mostly take . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pine bough that insisted on creeping up my pajama leg . Then strange rapping sounds began emanating from behind the closed galley door . Rather than fight my way again through that forest of needles , I laid the noise to sugarplums dancing in the heads of Michael and Nikki . ( That 's one head apiece , in case you should ask . ) Now , if you are among the groaners brought out of a good , sound snooze by the patter of little feet on the stairs Christmas morning , you should try being jerked out of a light doze by a kid 's train engine slamming into the side of your head just above the right ear . continued on page 102 // Microwave continued from page 40 away in a corner somewhere you may end up overcooking quite a few meals . No matter where in the kitchen you decide to place a microwave , be sure it 's set at an easy-to-reach  --  and safe  --  height . Convenience dictates that the oven 's cooking shelf be from two inches below to ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installations usually fall within this range . For safety reasons , the shelf of a microwave should never be higher than the user 's shoulder . Reaching for a hot plate of food can be risky business  --  especially if you have to stand on tiptoe to get to it . Units built to be flush with the bottom of adjacent wall cabinets are a bit high for people 5 ' 5 " or under . Other considerations to keep in mind  --  Once you decide on the placement of a microwave , you should think about what size of appliance will best suit your needs . Microwaves are now available in many different sizes , from large models with 1.6 cubic feet of interior space to the many new subcompacts with 0.4 to 0.6 cubic feet . In addition to position , the size you select will depend largely on how you plan to use the microwave . Always consider ventilation . Air circulation is required around the sides and the back of most microwaves . Manufacturers ' specification sheets will provide details , and most kitchen designers and contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors fully before installing a microwave oven . Some doors open down , which may be inconvenient at heights above counter-top level ; most open to the left , which may also influence the final location . Finally , position your microwave so that there 's sufficient work space either below or beside the oven : You do n't want to have to run around to find a spot for the dish you just took out of the oven . Now that you 've carefully considered all the options , finding just the right spot for your microwave should be simple , In fact , it should be as easy as using this modern appliance to whip up creative and delicious meals .
