If American museums had to subsist on Government money like the Louvre or the National Gallery in London , all would shrink , and many of the best would never have got started . Names like Whitney , Guggenheim , Phillips , Freer and Frick attest to the role played by the private collector in creating the public institution . Today more than ever the one-person museum , named for the man or woman who assembled it and put it in its own building , is a ruling fantasy of the ambitious collector . Why settle for your name on a plaque in the Met when for a few extra million you can have the Ira D. Rumpelstiltskin Museum , all your own ? <P> So far this year , at least three American private collections have gone public , with their own buildings and curatorial staff . One , the Menil Collection in Houston , is a triumph . The others , the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington ( based on a collection put together by Wilhelmina and Wallace Holladay ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that . <P> The National Museum of Women in the Arts is a virtuous bore . Until ten years ago , with a few resolute exceptions like Georgia O'Keeffe , Mary Cassatt and Louise Nevelson , women artists were shabbily treated by American museums and either omitted from their collections or treated as token presences . The idea that art by women was necessarily second rate lingered discreetly in some quarters through the ' 70s . Today it is gone , at least in America . Apart from political enlightenment , one of the things that killed it was the growth of the art market . Now that any list of collectors ' favorites in current art would have to include Nancy Graves , Agnes Martin , Louise Bourgeois , Susan Rothenberg , Elizabeth Murray , Jennifer Bartlett , Cindy Sherman and Joan Snyder , it is fatuous to talk as though women in 1987 formed an oppressed aesthetic class . About half the substructure of power in the art world , from museum curators and dealers to critics and corporate art advisers , is female . No talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery . <P> What is true , however , is that most female artists , like most male ones , are not very talented and live ill-known in a catastrophically overcrowded art world . Thus it is easy for Ms. Anybody , M.F.A. , to blame the obscurity of her work on sexist machinations against her as a member of a class and plangently call for redress in quotas and affirmative action . Hence the National Museum of Women in the Arts , a grimly sentimental waste of money , an idea whose time is gone .
