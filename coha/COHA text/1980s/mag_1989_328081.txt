As the ship roared higher and higher into the cloudless Florida sky , the words of Lisa Malone , the new voice of Launch Control , were cool and precise : " Discovery  --  performance nominal . " But if Malone , the first woman to deliver the countdown for a space shot , betrayed little emotion , her colleagues at NASA could barely contain their excitement . " It gets better every time , " exulted NASA administrator James Fletcher . He had reason to cheer : last week 's launch of Discovery , the third shuttle mission since the 1986 Challenger disaster , was another significant milestone in the comeback of the U.S. space program . <P> The flight 's highlight was the deployment of the $100 million Tracking and Data-Relay Satellite , which completes an orbiting communications network that will let the space agency reduce its reliance on an expensive series of ground stations . Much more was riding on Discovery , though , than a single satellite . Without a successful launch , NASA could not hope to stick to its ambitious schedule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital to a whole series of important scientific missions , including sending a probe to Jupiter and placing a powerful telescope in orbit . Those launches , plus several other missions that do not depend on the shuttle , could make 1989 the most eventful year in space science since the 1970s . <P> The next liftoff should come in April , when the shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to send a craft called Magellan on its way to Venus . The space probe will begin orbiting the planet next year , using radar to map its cloud-hidden surface . The best maps now in existence , compiled by Soviet spacecraft , show features as small as a quarter-mile across , but Magellan is expected to do about ten times as well . <P> In early October a 40-day window will open for the shuttle launch of Galileo , a craft that will head toward the sun , swing around Venus , and then use the earth 's gravity to sling itself out to Jupiter . When it arrives in late 1995 , Galileo will drop a probe into the seething maelstrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rove through the Jovian system to explore its moons . <P> Come December , NASA plans to use a shuttle to send aloft the Hubble Space Telescope . The so-called ST will fly above the earth 's atmosphere , whose turbulence limits the clarity of astronomical photos taken from the planet 's surface . The ST 's forte will thus be the sharpness of its pictures , which astronomers hope will help answer long-standing questions about the structures of distant galaxies and mysterious pinpoints of light called quasars , and about whether other stars have planets similar to earth .
