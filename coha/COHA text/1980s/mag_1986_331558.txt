Johnson &; Johnson Chairman James Burke is not one to back away from trouble . Appearing last week on the Donahue television program to answer questions about the Tylenol poisoning earlier this month , Burke reacted swiftly when one caller denounced the culprit as a terrorist . In a gesture that was rare for a buttoned-down businessman , he clenched his fist and pumped it in the air , as if to say , " Right on . I agree . " <P> It was a fitting symbol of the drug manufacturer 's dramatic response to ! the tragedy . Only the day before , Burke had announced that Johnson &; Johnson would no longer sell any of its over-the-counter drugs in capsule form . The pharmaceuticals maker saw the move as the best hope of preventing a recurrence of the still unsolved poisoning of Diane Elsroth , 23 , of Peekskill , N.Y. , who died Feb. 8 , after swallowing two Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with potassium cyanide . Said Burke at a press conference : " We take this action with great reluctance and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tampering with capsules after they leave our plant , we feel we owe it to consumers to remove capsules from the market . " <P> The decision will cost Johnson &; Johnson as much as $150 million to recall its capsules and scrap their production . In addition to Tylenol , Johnson &; Johnson made and sold capsule forms of Sine-Aid , a remedy for sinus congestion , and Dimensyn , a medicine for the relief of menstrual pain . The capsule form of Tylenol amounted to about 30% of the pain reliever 's estimated 1985 sales of $525 million . To make up for its loss , the company last week began promoting Tylenol in the form of caplets , which are the smooth , elongated tablets that Johnson &; Johnson began producing in 1983 , after seven people in the Chicago area were poisoned by tainted Tylenol capsules . The caplets , far more difficult to adulterate , already make up about 15% of all Tylenol sales . <P> Johnson &; Johnson 's sudden decision prompted the pharmaceutical industry to re-examine its widespread use of over-the-counter capsules , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dexatrim diet formula . But as the industry sent its packaging experts to Washington last week for an emergency meeting with Food and Drug Administration officials , most companies said that they would keep on using capsules . <P> A huge consumer demand for capsules still exists despite the Tylenol scare . Many people find the gelatin-cased medicine easier to swallow and less bitter than tablets . The bright color combinations of capsules also make them more readily identifiable . Moreover , because so many prescription medicines come in capsule form , a common  --  but false  --  impression has arisen that capsules are more effective than tablets . <P> For greater safety , several companies have devised methods of sealing the individual capsules to make them tamper resistant . Eli Lilly has developed a tiny belt of gelatin that binds , like a piece of tape , the top and bottom halves and makes it difficult to open a capsule without tearing it . Sterling Drug uses sound waves to create a kind of spot-weld on capsules of its Panadol pain reliever . Johnson &; Johnson says that it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely secure .
