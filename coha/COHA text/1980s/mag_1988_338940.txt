Folklore has it that August is the time when all the shrinks go on vacation , leaving behind heat , humidity and the miasma of anxiety surrounding their patients . What are these abandoned psyches supposed to do for a whole month ? This summer offers them a new option . They might pick up a copy of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson 's Against Therapy , turn to the preface and read the following : " This is a book about why I believe psychotherapy , of any kind , is wrong . Although I criticize many individual therapists and therapies , my main objective is to point out that the very idea of psychotherapy is wrong . " <P> This is not the first time that Masson , a nonpracticing psychoanalyst , has published a book designed to drive mental-health professionals nuts . His The Assault on Truth ( 1984 ) attracted headlines and controversy with the charge that Sigmund Freud had fudged certain of his evidence and thereby left the whole foundation of psychoanalysis teetering . According to Masson , Freud had initially believed his female patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused , often by fathers or other relatives . But under strong pressure from a male colleague , and knowing how little his fellow Viennese cared to hear or to talk about incest , Freud later changed his mind : these women had not been molested or seduced ; they had fantasized such experiences . <P> Masson harks back to this accusation fairly often in Against Therapy , but Freud is not specifically his target this time . Instead , the author is gunning for everyone who has ever had the gall to offer any sort of psychological treatment or aid to another person . His subtitle accurately indicates just how hyperventilating his argument is going to be : " Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing . " Readers looking for nuance or subtlety should probably go elsewhere . But Masson raises some intriguing points , even if he insists on doing so at the top of his voice . Psychotherapy is a big and largely unchallenged business in the U.S. ; many of its practitioners wield considerable influence over personal lives and public policy . Once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmist hollering that some of those shrinks have no clothes . <P> Actually , Masson goes much further than this . " The therapeutic relationship , " he writes , " always involves an imbalance of power . One person pays ; the other receives . Vacations , time , duration of the sessions are all in the hands of one party . Only one person is thought to be an ' expert ' in human relations and feelings . Only one person is thought to be in trouble . " Well , one is tempted to say , yes indeed , that is the way it happens . Masson , however , is an absolutist ; he is of the persuasion that if something is not perfect it is terrible . This point of view rarely works well in the real world , but there are instances in which it can be helpful . And the author 's point that the possibility for mischief is inherent in psychological counseling seems inarguable.                    @
