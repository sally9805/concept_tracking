JACKSON , Mich.  --  Consumers Power Co. lowered its common stock dividend to 35 cents quarterly from 63 cents . The utility also raised its estimate for completing the first of the planned two electric-generating units at its Midland , Mich. , nuclear project to $3. 95 billion . The company declined to say how much of an increase that represents ; previous company cost projections have assumed completion of both units as a single plant . The most recent protection put the two at $4. 43 billion , but it isn ' t necessarily the case that each unit equals 50% of the cost . The troubled utility also declined to disclose a cost estimate or a completion schedule for the second unit , underscoring the possibility it will abandon that unit , an option company officials have held out in talks with state officials . Consumers also reported at its annual meeting a 33% increase in first-quarter earnings to $125. 2 million , or $1. 08 a share , from $93. 9 million , or 96 cents a share , a year earlier . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher earnings to economic recovery in Michigan and to a severely cold winter , which boosted energy consumption . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Consumers closed at $9 , up 50 cents . The reduced dividend is payable May 21 to stock of record April 27 . The reduction reflects " uncertainties over the Midland " project and a need to conserve cash , the company said . At the same time , management said , the board didn ' t omit the dividend because it hopes to maintain some access to equity markets . Consumers is the third utility this year to reduce or eliminate its dividend because of financial troubles related to nuclear plants . Last month , Long Island Lighting Co. eliminated its dividend because of problems at its Shoreham plant , which is under contruction . Early this year , Public Service Co. of Indiana cut its dividend 65% and canceled the partly finished Marble Hill nuclear plant . The new $3. 95 billion cost estimate for a completed first unit at Midland brings the indicated value of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state regulators that its investment in the incomplete second unit totals nearly $1 billion . Last year , Consumers projected the cost of both units at $4. 43 billion , but that was before additional delays related to safety and construction problems and the withdrawal of Dow Chemical Co. as the prospective major customer of the second unit added more costs . Consumers said it currently expects to put the first unit into commercial operation by December 1986 , about six months later than it previously indicated . In disclosing the cost estimate for completing the first unit , John D. Selby , Consumers chairman , acknowledged at the annual meeting that the company can ' t complete the plant without the concurrence of state officials . Consumers and representatives of the Michigan attorney general and state utility commission have been negotiating over the plant ' s future for the past several weeks . As reported , the state officials have argued that the plant isn ' t needed and have proposed that Consumers abandon the project  --  an option that Consumers has rejected . Mr. Selby said another big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital it needs to complete the plant . Because of the Midland project ' s continued problems and a series of cancellations of other troubled nuclear plants , financial markets have become costly for Consumers . Also in the annual meeting , shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the Consumers board be asked to halt construction at Midland for one year , pending a review of its safety and construction problems by an independent evaluator . The Capuchin Franciscans , a Roman Catholic order and a stockholder in Consumers , submitted the proposal , voicing concern about the project ' s effect on the utility ' s dividend . Shareholders also approved amendments increasing the authorized number of common shares to 125 million from 100 million and of preference shares to 40 million from 25 million . As of Dec. 31 , the company had 86. 9 million common and 21. 6 million preference shares outstanding . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
