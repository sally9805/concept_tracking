The victim had no identification . All police found last week in an abandoned house on Detroit 's West Side was the body of a " woman " shot once in the head . The following day , the morgue 's chief investigator identified her as Jamelle Williams , 14 , a runaway . She became the 40th child under 17 to be shot to death in Detroit this year . <P> Already plagued by the nation 's highest homicide rate , Detroit is experiencing an epidemic of children shooting children . As of Dec. 11 , said a Detroit Free Press report , 341 youngsters under 17 had been shot this year , a sharp rise from last year , when 237 were shot , 31 of them fatally . Police have charged 36 children with homicide ; the youngest is twelve . <P> Two days before Williams ' death , Detroit Mayor Coleman Young reluctantly signed a gun ordinance that imposes a minimum 30-day jail sentence for a first offense of carrying a concealed firearm without a permit . Young , who has beefed up Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize community action against crime , described the ordinance as " little more than a fig leaf covering . . . a very complex and very serious problem . " <P> Young attributes the problem in part to an unemployment rate among inner- city black youth that far exceeds 50% . Some city leaders , however , point fingers at Young , who has long been hostile to gun control and has asserted that citizens need to be able to defend themselves . The availability of handguns , critics say , makes violence inevitable . Says FBI Agent John Anthony : " I remember when carrying a gun was pretty heavy stuff . Now you get 14- and 15-year-old kids carrying guns . " Anthony and others claim that the widespread sale and use of crack has promoted warfare among young , heavily armed drug dealers . Notes Harry Hamilton , chief investigator at the morgue : " Kids can make $900 a week standing on a street corner whistling when a scout car goes by . There are plenty of 15- or 16-year-olds doing things like that , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to see an end to the cycle of violence . Young says there are no jobs for kids and no jail space for criminals . But some hope the mandatory sentences for illegal firearms will make young and old think twice before picking up a gun .
