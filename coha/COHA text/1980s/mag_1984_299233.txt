ULYSSES : A CRITICAL AND SYNOPTIC EDITION Prepared by Hans Walter Gabler ; Garland ; 3 volumes ; 1,919 pages ; $200 <P> For 62 years , scholars and zealous readers have heard confirmed rumors about the typographical mistakes in Ulysses . The first person to notice them was the author himself . Shortly before his epic novel appeared in February 1922 , James Joyce wrote an editor : " I an extremely irritated by all those printer 's errors . " They were , in part , his own fault . An obsessive reviser , Joyce scrawled some 100,000 additional words in the margins of galleys as they were sent to him for proofreading . These changes had to be incorporated into what was al ready becoming a palimpsest of confusion : diverse typists ' errant renderings of various stages of Joyce 's manuscript , compounded by a team of French-speaking printers who were being hectored by the author to get the finished product into his hands on the occasion of his 40th birthday . <P> The deadline was met , although the book Joyce saw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly recognized as a classic , Ulysses went through subsequent editions that corrected some mistakes while adding others . A nagging question arose and persisted : How to distinguish the novel 's intentional complexities from accidental garbles ? <P> The whole world has not been waiting for an answer , to be sure , but here it is anyhow . Seven years in the making ( the same length of time it took Joyce to write the book ) , this new edition of Ulysses has been painstakingly reconstructed , with the aid of a computer , from all of the surviving documents of composition . It rectifies some 5,000 gaffes in previous publications of the novel . <P> That number , in isolation , sounds horrendous ; indeed , any botching of a written word in an acknowledged masterpiece is one too many . But Ulysses consists of well over 400,000 words ; so the margin of error has hovered somewhere under 2% . Furthermore , the vast majority of corrections made by Professor Hans Walter Gabler of the University of Munich and his colleagues involve spelling and punctuation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text that transformed 20th century literature . <P> There may thus be less in this expansive and expensive production than meets the eye . But the result , even with a price tag of $200 , is by no means negligible . For openers , at least one major puzzle posed by earlier editions of the novel has been solved . Stephen Dedalus , a brooding young poet who wanders through Dublin June 16 , 1904 , is haunted by the recent death of his mother . Late at night , drunk and hallucinating , Stephen sees her in a vision and pleads : " Tell me the word , mother , if you know now . The word known to all men . " She does not do so . But the identity of that word is contained in a passage , earlier in the novel , that was omitted from the first and all following editions until this one ( see box ) . The word is love . <P> This discovery underscores the connections between Dedalus and Leopold Bloom , the other hero of Ulysses . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear : " Love , says Bloom . I mean the opposite of hatred . " The fact that he does so when Stephen is not present makes their later meeting and parting more poignant and ironic .
