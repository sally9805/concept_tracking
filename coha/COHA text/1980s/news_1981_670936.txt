It is uncertain whether the incidents , in which at least 9 people were killed and 59 seriously injured , were a spontaneous outburst of nationalist discontent by the ethnic Albanians who make up most of the province ' s population or a meticulously planned action to undermine the Yugoslav Government. // What is evident from both public and private declarations by key officials is that Belgrade considers the events in Kosovo Province of the utmost gravity and is not very sure what to do to prevent a recurrence. // The official press agency , Tanyug , has reported that the situation has gradually returned to normal . The nighttime curfew has been lifted , factories are operating normally and elementary schools have reopened. // // Ban on Public Gatherings // Nevertheless , the situation apparently remains unsettled , since army and police reinforcements are still in Kosovo and public gatherings are banned. // According to the official account , the events began March 11 , in the university canteen at Pristina , capital of the province , when an unhappy student threw his tray of food on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent demonstrations with slogans calling for the establishment of an Albanian republic. // Stane Dolanc , a senior Communist Party official , gave the central Government ' s response at a news conference earlier this month , declaring that the call for an Albanian republic of Kosovo was " impossible " under the Constitution and " would mean essentially the collapse of Yugoslavia. " // Non-Yugoslavs here find it somewhat difficult to understand the inflexibility of Yugoslavs on this question . Yugoslavia ' s federal state already has six republics ; what difference would one more republic make ? Why not a republic of Kosovo , since 85 percent of the 1. 5 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians ? <> <> Rights of Ethnic Albanians // It is just as difficult to understand why ethnic Albanians so fiercely demanded the status of a republic , when under their present status as a Socialist Autonomous Province they have virtually all the rights of a republic , including their own administration , banking , courts , flag and language - everything except the right to secede. // According to the 1974 Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " voluntarily united nations , " which presupposes that these nations or republics have the right to pull out of the federation . On the other hand , it is specified that any territory of a republic , that is , the autonomous provinces , may not be altered without the consent of that republic. // The simple explanation for Yugoslavia ' s rejection of the ethnic Albanians ' request for a republic is that the Republic of Serbia would not agree to the amputation of its southern province , which was the historical heartland of the ancient kingdom of Serbia. // There are only 228 , 000 Serbs living in Kosovo today , compared with about one million ethnic Albanians . The Serbs were first driven out by the Turkish invasion in the 14th century and in modern times by the desire for a better life in the northern , industrialized part of the country . But in Kosovo remain the Orthodox Patriarchate of Pec , as well as many ancient monasteries and Serbian history , which can not be easily renounced . <> <> ' Conspiratorial Forces ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Kosovo events . Mr. Dolanc , the Government spokesman , accused " certain nationalistic groups linked to emigrants abroad " that he described as being either profascist or pro-Moscow. // There is a complex theory of conspiracy , which many high Yugoslav officials believe , involving designs for a " Greater Albania , " the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria ; allegedly at the root of it all is the Soviet Union. // A senior Communist Party official , with map in hand , explained in detail what he said might happen : // - In phase one , an Albanian republic of Kosovo would be set up , and the Albanian-inhabited areas of neighboring Macedonia and Montenegro would insist on annexation to such a republic. // - In phase two , the Albanian republic would pull out of the Yugoslav federation and proclaim itself part of a Greater Albania. // - In phase three , Bulgaria , which has always alleged that the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia were Bulgarians and refused to recognize the existence of Macedonia , could with greater justification claim the territory because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ethnic Bulgarians left. // - Finally , the theory goes , the Soviet Union could have a free corridor through Bulgaria and a Greater Albania to the Mediterranean . Albania , which has taken care to show that it had no hand in the Kosovo events , has portrayed them as a simple demonstration of nationalist discontent. // After a long silence , the Albanian Communist Party organ Zeri i Popullit produced a long editorial recently with the grievances of the students of Pristina , which were said to include bad living conditions , the gap in economic development between Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia , lack of freedom and democratic rights and the refusal of the right to their own republic . <> <> ' Misuse of Democracy ' // " Haven ' t the Albanians of Kosovo all these qualities and characteristics making up a nation , don ' t they live on one compact territory with a common language , culture , religion , aren ' t they in a position to govern themselves ? " the Albanian Communist newspaper asked . It added that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberated from the tutelage of Serbia. " // Many Yugoslavs find it difficult to understand such nationalist arguments and what is perceived as the " ingratitude " of the ethnic Albanian demonstrators and their " misuse of democracy . " Above all they fail to understand signs of irredentism with an Albania that is known to be much more closed and less developed than Kosovo , let alone the rest of Yugoslavia . They point out the major sums invested in the province since the end of World War II , and the schools , hospitals , factories and power stations that have been built. // Nevertheless , politicians and economists acknowledge that this rapid development has also brought new problems . A top planning official disclosed that according to projections the rate of economic growth in Kosovo from 1975 to the year 2000 will be 80 percent , but the labor force will have tripled. // The authorities have not said how they plan to cope with the challenges in Kosovo . It is clear , however , that although they will undoubtedly clean up the local Communist Party leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly raise criticism from the West. // It appears that in the long run , the authorities will try to give Kosovo more of the same broad autonomy and development aid , but both Yugoslavs and foreigners are asking whether this will be enough. //
