Reagan talks about the campaign , political shifts and a second term <P> During the final eight days of the 1984 election campaign , Ronald Reagan met twice with the editors of TIME for exclusive interviews . The first occasion was in the Oval Office , the second in Los Angeles'Century Plaza Hotel on the afternoon of his election victory . At both sessions he was filled with zest and optimism as he talked of where he felt America stood today and what might be achieved in his second term . Excerpts : <P> <P> Q. A lot of people have said that this election may bring a political realignment in America . Do you think that is so ? <P> <P> A. I 've gotten superstitious about talking about things of that kind . But I do believe that there has been a realignment in the sense of political philosophy . Some of the things that we have tried to do in the economy have gained support . There is less of that great division between the two parties philosophically . Not the leadership ; the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I think there are people out there , that , regardless of affiliation , want a return to a free economy and less Government invasion of their lives and their businesses . Whether that could make for a political realignment , or whether we are going to see some basic changes in the philosophy of the parties-that too could happen . <P> Some people stay where they are in their own party , but they make their party go in a different direction . <P> <P> Q. What can be done to encourage that process in a second term ? <P> <P> A. Continue our program of reducing the intrusiveness of Government , reducing the rate of increase in Government spending , have tax policies that provide incentive for growth in the economy and let the people see that , to their surprise , it works . <P> <P> Q. Do you view a second four years as primarily an opportunity to fine-tune what you have already accomplished , or do you think there is a chance for more large steps in the direction of your goals ? <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team from his own ten-yard line down to the opposing team 's 20-yard line is he going to change his game plan ? No . It 's working . We started out to reduce the size of Government . We started out to provide the incentives , taxwise , that would create economic growth and reduce unemployment . We started out to rebuild our defenses and then to actively seek arms reductions . Those are still our policies . <P> <P> Q. Is tax reform the biggest specific domestic goal ? <P> <P> A. Oh no , I think it 's a very important one and I think it has been a long time coming . When you have a system that can have at least $100 billion that is not being collected from people who legitimately owe it-there 's a flaw . Tax reform is a part of the whole economic problem that faces us . I think we 've made a good start and this is a case now of going further with it . One thing , above all , I wo n't stand still for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying a tax increase . <P> <P> Q. In your U.N . speech in September , you made the point very vigorously about your desire for genuine arms reduction . Do you envision much more time and energy being focused on that ? <P>
