Signs of a Pickup Abroad TIME 's European Board of Economists sees a timid recovery <P> Tantalizingly visible on the horizon , a weak and exceedingly vulnerable economic recovery will at last begin to take shape for the struggling nations of Western Europe during the second half of 1983 . That was the cautious view of TIME 'S European Board of Economists , which met in Geneva last week to survey the West 's hesitant forces for recovery-most notably the falling interest rates around the world-and to weigh them against the twin recessionary demons of global debt and rising protectionism that are threatening the economies of nations everywhere . <P> In the six-hour meeting , marked by more disagreement than usual , the six economists also sought to put into perspective the deep pessimism that has gripped Western Europe-an officials in recent weeks . There are in factl some bright spots . Indeed , at a time when protectionist pressures are mounting everywhere , Board Member Jan Tumlir , chief economist for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva , argued that the chances of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European partners , remain remote , if only because both sides fear the economic carnage that would ensue . Tumlir even found a " silver lining " in the GATT meeting two weeks ago , which pitted U.S. negotiators against the European Community over the issue of agriculture subsidies . Although the meeting generally was regarded as at least a setback to world trade , Tumlir saw in the desperate last-minute efforts to prevent an impasse proof that the main participants recognized the grave consequences of total failure . Concluded Tumlir : " If everybody were as pessimistic as the politicians , it would be inconceivable that the Western economies would have held so steadily . " <P> Debt as well has so far proved a manageable problem . By cooperation on a case-by-case basis , the board noted that banks and governments in the industrialized world so far have staved off the nightmare of a major default by cash-starved borrowers ranging from Mexico to Poland . And though unemployment is currently at 10.5% of the labor force in Western Europe as a whole , and rising , the specter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board Member Hans Mast , a University of Zurich lecturer and executive vice president for Crdit Suisse , inflation should have been driven down from a current level of 8.5% to an annual rate of no more than about 7.5% , the lowest in more than a decade . <P> Sam Brittan , assistant editor of London 's Financial Times , pointed out that the recent downturn in the value of the U.S. dollar and the British pound should help ease protectionist pressures both in the U.S. and throughout Western Europe . The U.S. and Britain , whose exports have suffered from overvalued currencies for more than a year , are now expected to be less inclined toward curbing imports . Reason : foreign-made goods will become relatively more expensive , and thus less competitive , in the U.S. and British markets , thereby helping to stimulate sales for domestic manufacturers and reduce demands for protectionist measures .
