The eight-block district , with some of its leafy streets and small houses resembling parts of the Georgetown section of Washington is under assault from the same forces of housing shortages , rising real-estate values and the economics of gentrification that threaten low-cost housing in many cities and towns. // The black population here stands at 15 percent of the borough of 12 , 000 , down from 20 percent a decade ago . But more significantly , from the point of view of local officials and citizens who want to preserve the city ' s historic black district , the remaining blacks are increasingly moving out of the Witherspoon area to outlying developments or , in the case of young blacks , leaving entirely. // This is weakening the district ' s black identity and sense of community , its churches and its political core. // " We ' re driving poor people out of town , and , as a matter of personal preference , I ' d like to keep them here , " Mayor Barbara B. Sigmund said . As it is , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-fulfilling prophecy. " // What is now the Witherspoon area has , in fact , been an identifiable black neighborhood since the early 18th century , when it was settled by free blacks who , for genera-tions , were the servants , journeymen and shopkeepers here . They built churches , schools and other centers that survived with their black identities intact under the segregation practiced at the time. // But the neighborhood is unraveling in the face of open-housing patterns and the hunger of home buyers for a house with a Princeton mailing address. // To many , the pressure on the Witherspoon district seems inevitable , given its location within walking distance of Nassau Street , the fashionable thoroughfare , and the downtown business district , and the inflation of housing prices in the rest of the borough. // Even a decade ago , local groups began to notice the exodus of blacks , either because of retirements or because of rising rents . At that time the Witherspoon Jackson Development Corporation was formed by citizens and churches to buy available houses in the black district and resell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at affordable prices. // The corporation has turned over 17 properties in this way and kept three others in black hands by rescuing them from tax defaults . <> <> Too Little Money // But the $97 , 000 originally raised to serve as a revolving fund to buy and sell houses 10 years ago is too little to keep up with rising prices . The future of the corporation " is up for grabs , " according to the group ' s volunteer president and the Borough Clerk , Penelope S. Carter. // " Say we raised another $100 , 000 , " she said . " Because all of the houses are now selling for over $100 , 000 , that ' s not going to allow us to meet the guidelines that the corporation was originally formed for - to sell homes at reduced rates . There has to be a subsidizing of the property to keep them affordable , but with homes going for $125 , 000 and up , we can ' t do it. " // The corporation ' s figures bear out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prejudice , was out of the maintstream of the Princeton real-estate market until recently. // In 1979 , seven of the two- and three-bedroom homes in the Witherspoon area sold at an average price of $42 , 000 . This year , eight properties have either been sold , are under contract or are on the market at an average $106 , 000. // The turnover appears to be increasing as more residents , many of them elderly and retired , take advantage of the prices to sell their homes and move into retirement apartments elsewhere. // The Rev. Michael Nabors of the First Baptist Church , a 100-year-old pillar of the neighborhood , on John Street , recently gave a tour of the area . He pointed out a modest two-story house on Green Street. // " A young white man bought that house for $70 , 000 and did some fixing up , and now he ' s selling it for around $150 , 000 , " Mr. Nabors said . " You can see that that ' s no $150 , 000 house - I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth that much . But someone will buy it. " // Mr. Nabors , at the age of 26 , exemplifies a new generation of young black ministers here . <> <> Hopes for Youthfulness // " The black churches have a stake in this issue , very definitely , " he said . " As blacks leave , the churches lose their membership , and I have some friends who say that in 15 years there won ' t be a First Baptist Church here , and this church is 100 years old. " // Mr. Nabors knows that one of the reasons he was hired , fresh out of the Princeton Theological Seminary and without previous pastoral experience , was the deacons ' hopes that his youthfulness might help him persuade other young blacks to stay in Princeton - and in the old Witherspoon community - after high school and college. // He has formed a youth group of about 65 young people at First Baptist , but so far finds little reason to hope that they will stay on . <> <> On the Outskirts // " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton , " he said . " In spite of the tremendous resources of Princeton , employment opportunities and everything , most would want to leave . And that ' s a reflection of how this youth believes they have been received by Princeton. " // It upsets Mr. Nabors also that so many blacks have left the Witherspoon area only to settle in some of the new rent-subsidized housing on the outskirts of town. // Mr. Nabors considers Princeton to be largely benign on racial issues , with a concerned mayor and a majority of residents sensitive to blacks . Yet he is concerned about the sight of a rent-subsidized garden apartment tucked in among the nearby oak and ash woods. // " Not only is this inferior housing compared to what these people had in the Withrspoon area , " he said , " it is also on the borders of Princeton and strategically located where they can ' t be seen. // " I think that ' s tragic . It ' s like moving the black people to the back of the plantation , out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
