Companies ' share prices usually go up when management announces a stock buyback . But in the two trading days since ITT said Tuesday that it would buy back 10 million shares , its stock has fallen 2 5/8 points . " In the scheme of things , I guess you could say it wasn ' t a positive reaction . It was a mild disappointment , " Jack Kelly , who follows conglomerates for Goldman Sachs , says . Mr. Kelly had expected the buyback to total 15 million shares , or about 10% of those outstanding . Other predictions ranged as high as 20 million . ITT had been hinting at a buyback ever since it made a surprise decision last summer to sell its telecommunications operations for $1. 3 billion to a French venture in which it retains a 37% interest . Within two weeks , its stock soared 31% , helping it outperform the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 index by 25 percentage points in 1986 . However , since that euphoric peak , ITT hasn ' t kept pace with the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold half of the ITT Corp. shares in accounts he manages to get money to buy gold stocks . E.F. Hutton analyst Larry Baker says the buyback announcement came four months later than some expected and didn ' t include an explicit timetable . " The wording of the announcement did not imply a great deal of enthusiasm ( for the buyback ) on the part of the company , " Mr. Baker says . The French telecommunications sale brought to $3. 4 billion the total proceeds from sales and divestitures by ITT Chairman Rand Araskog since 1985 , when he began responding to threats by raiders with a corporate slim-down plan . Yet the buyback will only consume about $710 million , counting the cost of some preferred that ITT also is redeeming . What happened to the rest ? A company spokesman said yesterday that ITT has used the proceeds to reduce debt by about $660 million , to beef up its cash position to its current level of $1. 3 billion , to expand insurance and finance operations , and on research projects . One project that flopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 . Despite the setback , ITT holders and analysts who follow the stock remain hopeful that the company " has a lot of powder left , a lot of room to move , " as Rob Lyon of Fred Alger Management puts it . Alger owns about 1. 5 million ITT shares . Both Goldman and Hutton recommend the stock . Among the possibilities are a dividend increase , which Mr. Kelly says could add 30 to 40 cents to the current $1-a-share annual payout . Mr. Araskog has said that might be considered this year . ITT is expected to shed its Rayonier forest products division , whose value has risen in recent months along with that of other cyclical natural-resource companies . Many of those companies ' export products have become cheaper because of the falling dollar . Analysts estimate that the unit could fetch $700 million to $1 billion . Some say ITT might also sell its 24% stake in a British telecommunications concern that trades on the London stock exchange . The stake has a current market value of about $550 million . Mr. Lyon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Sheraton hotel unit , which with help from a real estate venture brought ITT $675 million in 1986 revenue . That unit , he says , might be worth more than $1 billion . One prospect that makes some holders nervous is the chance that ITT might embark on some expensive , ill-advised acquisition . In an interview last summer after the French sale announcement , Mr. Araskog mentioned entertainment and hospital services among fields under consideration . But the ITT chief later signaled an intent to keep purchases under $500 million and within ITT ' s remaining businesses . The big pieces left are financial services , auto parts , defense and aerospace , industrial and forest products , communications , and hotels . Mr. Kelly envisions a manufacturing acquisition that would , for example , add to the auto-parts line . " Very few companies today are urged by their shareholders to make an acquisition in this market . Divestitures are wildly cheered , and acquisitions are generally booed , " Hutton ' s Mr. Baker says . " A large acquisition by ITT would not win market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British shares and buy back more stock . He calls ITT ' s own shares " the cheapest acquisition they could make . " The stock is trading at only about 11 times expected 1987 earnings of $5. 50 a share , a 40% discount to the market . But Mr. Lyon also praises Mr. Araskog for pulling off the French sale with a finesse beyond that of a corporate raider . " He hasn ' t gotten credit for what he has done , " Mr. Lyon says . Raiders , he says , " don ' t know the prime minister of France .
