In March , Cuomo offhandedly told a Los Angeles Times reporter that opposition to New York 's new mandatory seat-belt law had mostly come from " N.R.A . hunters , who drink beer , do n't vote and lie to their wives about where they were all weekend . " When he saw his words in a Times story last month , the liberal Democratic Governor and possible presidential candidate realized that he had insulted a large , well-organized conservative lobby . <P> To clear things up , the Governor broached the subject on his statewide monthly radio show . Cuomo also sent a long apology to then-N.R.A . President Howard Pollock , enclosing the Times piece , as well as a transcript of his radio remarks . " My response was inartful , " Cuomo wrote , " and could leave a false impression of disrespect for the National Rifle Association . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gaffe , blasted the Governor in a national press release and vowed that its voice , in the form of about 200,000 members in New York State , would be heard at the polls should Cuomo run for re-election next year .
