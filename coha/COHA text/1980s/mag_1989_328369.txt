As Jordan 's King Hussein discussed the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace with George Bush in Washington last week , life was decidedly less than peaceful in the monarch 's desert realm . The trouble started in the southern town of Ma'an when thousands of demonstrators attacked government office buildings and burned banks to protest increases in the price of food , gasoline and other goods . The riots quickly spread to other southern towns and then to the northern city of Salt . Hussein 's brother Crown Prince Hassan , whose car was pelted with stones when he visited Ma'an , blamed Islamic fundamentalists for exploiting the unrest . At least eight people had been killed , apparently all of them civilians . <P> The disturbances shocked many Jordanians , whose country has been remarkably stable for nearly two decades in spite of its precarious geographical location . Outwardly the protesters focused their anger on Prime Minister Zaid Rifai , chanting , " This man must resign , or we will burn the country ! " <P> Leaving the U.S. , Hussein canceled a visit to Britain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein , most of the rioters were Bedouins and thus had been considered his most loyal subjects .
