t must have started in my A childhood , when my mother told me I could n't have that Mickey Mouse watch I wanted for my birthday . Mom was never a very good judge of future value . If she had bought that watch when I was eight years old , for a mere $10 , I could have sold it today for at least ten times the price she would have paid . So I learned my lesson  --  and began to collect everything in sight just as soon as I was grown up and had extra money to spend for pleasure . And it began to pay off handsomely . While on a trip to Maine , I hap  --  pened to stop at a church-sponsored auction . A set of blue bubble Depression glass was of  --  fered . The bidding was practically nonexistent . It seemed nobody realized that Depression glass is a collectible . I " stole " that 40-piece place setting for $8 ? and sold it two days later to a New York City antique dealer for $95 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment . I also learned a valuable lesson : The only way a collector makes a profit on his investment is to sell his collection . Time and again people have told me that they have a collection worth thousands  --  even millions  --  in genuine ancient whatchama  --  callits . That 's balderdash ! A collec  --  tion is only worth something if someone is willing to pay the price . This truly is the test . Your collec  --  tion must have a resale value and interest to someone other than you . Now let me tell you the next lesson I learned . I was shopping in a local bookstore and happened to see a copy of Marc Chagall 's Il lustrations for the Bible sitting on the shelf like an ordinary book . ( I happened to know that this par  --  ticular book is worth more than $2,000 ) . I asked the clerk if he realized this was a truly valuable book . He smiled and said , " Of course . " Then he took the book off the shelf and put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked on the front page  --  and saw that the price of the book had been changed from $200 to $2,000 . If I had n't opened my big mouth and told the clerk he had a valuable book , I could have picked up that Chagall volume for $200 . This , then , is lesson number two : When you have a special piece of information , keep it to yourself Now for my next lesson . Three years ago , while on a fishing trip with my friends Debbie and Milt Pierce , I noticed a store that adver  --  tised " old books . " That was some  --  thing I just could n't resist . When I looked in the store , I noticed a rare first edition of Mark Twain 's Life on the Mississippi . It was priced at $45 , far below the market value . I remembered then that another friend , Steven Grant , once told me that he would pay as much as $300 for that same book just to complete his collection of first-edition Mark Twains . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that book and resold it to Mr. Grant for $90 . ( I confess that I made a 100 percent profit on my in  --  vestment . I even told Grant that at the time . He was thoroughly delighted to get the Twain volume  --  at any price below $300 . ) The lesson I learned from this ex  --  perience : When you know that someone is actively interested in getting a particular collectible , you have a special advantage . Do n't miss your chance . The final lesson I am going to relate is perhaps the most impor  --  tant to any serious collector . It began in Rome , on vacation with George and Barbara Whit  --  field . Barbara was looking in a lit  --  tle store near the Spanish Steps . She noticed that the store had a wonderful collection of Russian icons . " These are very much in demand in New York , " Barbara told us . " If the price is right , I could make a killing . " The price was right , so Barbara borrowed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She came home to New York carrying a valise packed with Rus  --  sian icons , more than two dozen of them . She was amazed to find that the market had dropped out of the icon business , and she could not unload them . without taking a big loss . It was a lesson none of us forgot : You do n't have a real killing in the collectible business unless you are absolutely certain that you will be able to sell what you have bought . A transaction takes both a buyer and a seller . Focusing Your Collection Let 's say you 've decided to become a collector . You even have some ideas of what you want to col  --  lect . Your next step , then , is to nar  --  row down your ideas until you dis  --  cover exactly what you want . If you 're going to be a stamp col  --  lector , will you collect all stamps or just those from a certain coun  --  try  --  say , the United States ? Will you search for stamps printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used today ? These are just two of the many questions the stamp collector should answer before beginning a collection . You get the point . You ca n't just say you 're going to collect bottles , for instance . If you do , you 'll wind up with a cellar full of glass con  --  tainers that have no relationship to each other . To make some sense of your collection , as well as to obtain some profit from it , you have to know exactly what you want to col  --  lect : the specific type , quality , size , age of your bottles , among other things . Once you know what you want , you 'll know what to look for . Here are some ways you might decide to focus your collection : Historical period : Items from a certain era , such as Coke bottles from the 1930s and ' 40s , can form the basis of a collection . Make sure the time period you choose is long enough to give you an adequate supply of objects and short enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : All nutcrackers crack nuts , but they do n't all do it in the same way . So if you decide to collect nutcrackers , try to find as many different kinds as you can . The key here is find  --  ing a collection that is basically similar in one point ( i.e. , cracking nuts ) , yet different in many others ( structure of nutcracker , method used and so forth ) . Or you may have a collection of similar objects with only one difference  --  say , bot  --  tles with different types of corks . Special features : Included in this category might be necklaces or bracelets with a certain type of clasp , plates with butterflies on them or paisley-print quilts . The key here is selecting only those items that have the special feature you 've chosen . Complete set : The item you want to collect ( say , U.S. silver dollars ) may already be organized in a set . If so , your job is to find and pur  --  chase all the items in the set . Coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the items that fall into this category . Materials : This type of collection is defined by the material of which the objects are made . Copper , gold , silver , brass , steel , jade , ivory , even tin  --  each one is used to make different types of objects . If you have a special affinity for copper , you may want to build your collec  --  tion around objects made from it : jewelry , cooking pots or sculpture , for example . The same can be done with all other materials . ( Of course , some materials  --  such as gold or jade  --  may be prohibitively expen  --  sive , but others are generally affordable . ) Once you have focused your col lection , the next step is to find out how and where you can obtain the items you want . This second step in collecting is slightly more difficult . Now you have to go out and find what you want . You will notice I said " find , " not " buy . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up items for your collection without having to pay top money for them . To start , let 's look at some sources of free merchandise : Fields and beaches : These are a valuable source , not only for nature collections ( shells , rocks , arrow heads , leaves , flower petals ) , but also for small items that people may easily drop ( coins , cans and bottles , keys ) . Garbage dumps : Almost any  --  thing and everything can be ' found here , but it 's best to search only for common items . In other words , you probably wo n't find dinosaur bones , gold jewelry and Rem  --  brandt paintings in trash heaps . Attics , cellars and garages : These are a very rich source for col  --  lections , especially if they have n't been cleaned out in some time . Neighbors and friends may let you have some or all of the items you want in exchange for doing the cleaning . Letters : You can often obtain free items simply by writing away for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  try will automatically bring you a foreign stamp ) and free booklets are just some of the things you can collect through the mail . ( For ex  --  ample , I 've built a huge collection of foreign stamps by asking my banker to save them for me . ) Your own house : Your own possessions may already form a previously unnoticed collection . Or you may own valuable items you can exchange for what you want . Flea markets : Many dealers and sellers will barter if they like your merchandise . This can save you some cash . Secondhand shops : If you can get a job in one of these , the owner may be willing to pay you in mer  --  chandise rather than money . Condemned buildings : Many might already have been stripped of anything valuable , but it 's always good to take a look just in case something you want was left behind . In case of possible legal restrictions , check with the owner and/or police before entering the building . Household sales : This source is not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want for next to nothing . Since most people are selling their possessions just to get rid of them , they 're likely to agree to any price you name . At the expensive end of the mar  --  ket spectrum , of course , are the dealers , auctions and large private collectors . After you have estab  --  lished your collection , you may find it helpful or necessary to go to these more expensive sources . But in many cases you should be able to start your collection for little or nothing . There are two basic sources of in  --  formation on your field of interest : verbal and written . Both are prone to inaccuracies ; but if you have many sources , you can check them against each other and come up with a fairly good idea of how and what to collect . Verbal sources include owners of items you would like to collect , dealers , museum curators and other museum personnel , sponsors of auctions and exhibitions and sometimes even store clerks , flea market operators and owners of secondhand shops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep two things in mind : The speaker probably has at least some personal interest in the object . You must carefully weigh the information you receive , par  --  ticularly if you are planning to buy the object from the person you 're speaking with . Any seller aims to get the best possible price , and some sellers do n't mind misrep  --  resenting their merchandise in order to increase their profits . So be cautious and get the facts from more than one dealer or expert . Often , just a little bit of time could save a lot of money . The more questions you ask , the more information you 'll receive . Ask questions designed to gener  --  ate information , rather than ques  --  tions that require only a yes or no answer . A question like " Is it valuable ? " is not as helpful as " How valuable is it ? " You should also have a large store of written information at your disposal . Check your local library for sources on your subject of interest . Visit dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area book  --  stores for their collections on col  --  lections . Do n't neglect the exten  --  sive , well-researched information Continued on page 89 ( 5 ) A Theology of Government : It is no coincidence that the democratic system of government created in 1776 in the United States of America was in  --  spired by the Calvinist theologians who held the dignity of man as the cornerstone of faith .

In general , both these sources are free and open to the public . If you do n't find what you 're looking for , ask where you can find it . Read as much as you can about your collection before you go out and purchase items . Once you have done your initial re  --  search , do n't stop lear  --  ning .

Your collec  --  tion is only as good as what you put into it , so your research should continue as long as you are a collector . Organizing Your Collection The organization of your collection begins My Name ( print ) Address City State Zip stations . If there 's any doubt as to your ownership of an item , the mark will settle the question . Two other important aspects of organizing are security and insurance . When you first purchase an item , con  --  sider the safest place to store it and have it transported there immediately . Your collection of antique dolls might be safe in a locked display cabinet in your home , but that is certainly not the place for gold coins ! Bank vaults , museums and galleries are all secure places to store your collection , and the added security is usually well worth any fees you have to pay for storage . For those items that you plan to keep at home , it is wise to display or store them inside a locked cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cabinet . But when you 're lection . Then know exactly under what conditions the insurance company will pay you . Will your policy cover damages from moving , storms or of  --  ficial inspection ; depreciation or wear and tear ; damage as a result of repairs or restoration ; breakage of part or all of the collection ? If you insure the total collection but lose only a part of it , will you have to give what remains to the insurance company in order to receive payment ? These are just some of the questions only your insurance agent can answer . Make sure to ask them and get clear answers in writing . These are just some general tips to help organize , protect and guarantee your collection . If you require specific information related to any particular item , consult a local museum or expert in the field . Above all , do n't buy any item until you know exactly how you 're go ing to care for it . Preserving and Displaying Your Collection Once you have your collection organized and insured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain its value . Pre serving your collection is essential if you are to maintain its aes thetic and monetary value . The exact re pairs , restoration tech niques and cleaning procedures will vary with the type of item . The first step in pre serving your valuables is simply a matter of common sense : Handle ' thing with care . In general , use hands when holding any small and lift , rather than push , when ng a large item . Never touch - jugs on the front or back ; instead , them by holding both edges with hands . To handle any object made place a glove or cloth between . bject and your hands . ( Do n't allow guests to touch parts of your coi n. ' unless they know how to handle or unless you are willing to risk ng something damaged or broken. ) here and how you display your col ) n , if you choose to display it , is tly a matter of what you collect , valuable it is and what space you available . For items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prob want to have a lighted glass lay case or cabinet , perhaps lined Continued on page 100 Trash to Cash continued horn page 89 with a cloth in a matching or contrasting color to brighten the display . If you choose not to put your collection inside a cabinet or case , you must be careful to place it where it can not be knocked over , spilled on or easily stolen by some not-so  --  welcome guest . Some collectors go to great pains to fasten down any item they wish to keep outside a case . Keeping an object out in the open also requires more frequent cleaning and increases the risk of breakage , so it is generally not advisable . Most of the time your collection will probably be stored where it 's displayed . For those times when it has to be kept elsewhere , you should keep the following points in mind : hu  --  midity , ventilation , wrapping , protection against fire , insects and mildew , lighting and temperature . Although every item differs with respect to the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , all objects should be covered to keep dust out and should not be stored in any place where the temperature is above 72 degrees F. or below 50 degrees F. Paper items should never be cov  --  ered with newspaper ; this will only ruin your collec  --  tion ( newspaper attracts bugs ) . Because metal shelves conduct heat , they are not the fire protectors one might think ; if you wish to use them , cover them with felt . ( Some ex  --  perts believe wooden cabi  --  nets are the best storage places ; even if they are burned on the outside , their contents often remain un  --  damaged ) . Musical instru  --  ments require some circula  --  tion of air . Cloth items should generally be rolled rather than folded , and of course they must be pro  --  tected against moths and mildew . Since practically anything can be a collectible , storage requirements vary greatly . Thorough research of your par  --  ticular collection will give you more information on how best to care for it . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it wo n't be difficult to keep it going . Most people who begin to accumulate items of interest find that what started out as a hobby quickly turns into a habit . So involved do they become in their collection that it 's the first thing they turn to in their spare time . At times the act of collecting becomes more important than the collection itself . Even for those who do not become so compulsive , however , collecting can be an intensely satisfying and personally rewarding experience . It will bring you into a whole new world of people , places and things . You 'll broaden your horizons , make new discoveries and meet exciting new friends .

Two years or so after his father left , Pat Moynihan moved back from Louisville to join the family in living in a 14-room mansion in a I3-acre estate in plush Westchester County north of New York City . It was not a tough living by anybody 's standards  --  except perhaps the Rockefellers . But it turned out that his mother 's second marriage did n't hold up either , and she left and later divorced her second husband .
