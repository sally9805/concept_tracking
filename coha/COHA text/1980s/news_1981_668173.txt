The dismal housing market distorts the picture of real estate as an investment . In 1974 when real estate markets were in disarray , the speculative boom had left large amounts of vacant space . For many professionals the shakeout was welcome . It tightened appraisals , placed a greater emphasis on sound underwriting and drove the marginal operators from the market . This time it is different . The year just ended was rewarding for those who had the wisdom and resources to put some of their assets in bricks , mortar and land . Judiciously selected - the house , the condominium , the co- operative , the income property and the limited partnership - all have enabled the investor to keep ahead of the eroding dollar . Some obvious forces will continue to affect real estate investment : First is supply . Both business and individuals need space and shelter . Second , well located real estate can be financed . Third , the growing pressure from institutional investors , foreigners , pension funds and profit sharing plans will keep demand and prices strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like financing , will be short term . Growth of the public real estate limited partnership industry is a measure of the widespread interest in owning a piece of an office building , shopping center , industrial property or apartment complex by individuals who haveneither the ability to own such a property outright nor the skills to manage it . The Questor Associates annual report noted this growth in a profile of 18 sponsors which raised an average of $72 million per year between 1970 and 1975 but in later years increased to $192 million and by 1978 peaked at $517 million . These sponsors sold 228 properties , after holding each parcel for anaverage of 4.7 years , for a total gain of $179 million . It is estimated for the year just ended about $1 billion in public real estate syndications will be registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers , not to mention another substantial pool of private placements . Obviously , performance fueled this growth . In the last few years there has been a trend toward securities firms offering their own real estate investment programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 million offering by Paine Webber Income Properties after that firm decided it should play a more active role in asset management rather than just brokerage . S. Douglas Weil , formerly a senior vice president with Boston- based Property Capital Trust , was named to head this program . An MBA from Harvard Business School , Weil has been active in real estate investing and lecturing since 1960 . The first year of this fund was not an accurate measure of performance , because not all properties had been acquired , but about 75 percent of the 6.2 percent return was fully sheltered . A second fund of $15 million has been established . It is the intention of the sponsors to refinance or sell properties when maximum values have been reached with gains distributed to limited partners . This type of investment is geared for individuals with a gross income of at least $20,000 or a net worth of $75,000 . Units cost $1000 and a minimum of five units is required . The investment philosophy for these funds offers the attraction of local management . In every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The local partners enjoy the opportunity to free up cash but retain an interest in the property , and it assures management familiar with local markets . For individuals interested in this form of real estate investment , the principles are essentially the same as owning an income property - as mortgages are amortized there is equity built up . There is the advantage of depreciation or sheltering a portion of income , and , most important , the type of property such funds can buy are generally in growth areas where appreciation in value is likely .
