BASEBALL 'S YOUNGEST LEGEND Two dozen talent scouts had roosted in the bleachers at the Hillsborough High ball field in Tampa to watch the school 's gifted starting pitcher . But the youngster proved unable to control his throws that late-winter afternoon ; before the first inning was half over , the coach , Billy Reed , decided to change pitchers . The scouts began to leave . Meanwhile , Reed turned and waved his sleek left fielder to the mound . As the tall right-hander began warming up , the thunder-crack of ball striking catcher 's mitt filled the air . To a man , the scouts stopped in their tracks and hurried back . " They had never seen Dwight before , " Reed recalls . Perched on a milk crate on that same field , three baseballs clutched easily in his left hand , the veteran coach allows a small smile to tickle his face . " After that , they all started trailing after him . " Dwight Gooden , the unaffected star of the New York Mets , has had the sports world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Natural , ' " says the Mets ' pitching coach , Mel Stottlemyre , referring to the movie taken from the Bernard Malamud baseball novel . " Dwight 's probably the closest thing to a natural that we have in the game today . " Stottlemyre 's assessment reflects the consensus of a sport still abuzz over Gooden 's arrival . At age 17 , following his senior year in high school , the 6 ' 2 " Gooden was the Mets ' top choice in the annual free-agent draft . Promising as Gooden was , four teams picked other players first . At age 18 the minor-leaguer struggled to a three-wins , three-losses start with Lynchburg in the Class A Carolina League . There he had what wasfor him a unique experience . His coach chewed him out in mid-game for thinking so much that he was " pitching scared . " Angry at the coach , but receptive to the advice , Gooden responded by striking out the next nine batters he faced . He went on to win 15 consecutive games and to set a league record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gooden was invited to the Mets ' 1984 spring-training camp , common practice with budding prospects . He was given number 64 , indicative of his status as a nonroster player unlikely to make the squad . But by season 's end , only two years out of high school , Gooden had won 17 games and the National League rookie-of-the-year honors . His 276 strike-outs , the highest total ever recorded by a first-year player , led the majors . Last season , at age 20 , following one of the most masterly performances in baseball 's 116-year history , Gooden was unanimously voted the Cy Young Award as the National League 's best pitcher . The youngest Cy Young recipient ever led the majors in wins ( 24 , against 4 losses ) , strike-outs ( 268 , virtually one per inning ) , and earned-run average ( 1.53 allowed per game , the lowest figure in nearly 20 years ) . Along the way Gooden enjoyed superlative stretches unimaginable for most pitchers : 14 wins in a row ; 31 straight shutout innings ; and 49 consecutive innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way as the Mets stayed in the pennant race until the last weekend of the season . At age 21 , the most famous Dwight since Eisenhower is one of sport 's most watched performers . Predictably , everyone is cashing in , including Gooden , whose income from his playing contract ( $1.32 million ) and endorsements may exceed $3 million this year . Jim Neader , his agent , is also working on patenting Gooden 's nickname , " Dr. K. " ( The letter serves as baseball shorthand for strike-out . Gooden has been called " Doctor " or " Doctor D , " for Dwight , since he was seven . ) Last year the Mets drew approximately 5,000 additional fans , at an average ticket price of $7.50 , to each home game the prodigy started . On the NBC " Game of the Week " the Nielsen ratings went up half a point ( about 440,000 viewers ) when Good-en pitched . When Gooden gets two strikes on a batter at the Mets ' Shea Stadium , fans clamor by the thousands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a home run . " You ca n't help but hear it , " admits Gooden . But Gooden is more concerned with continued on page 91 // Shade exposed units and areas  --  Your air conditioner gets rid of its heat through the condensing unit mounted outside your home , so it makes sense to place the condenser in a shady spot . This rule applies to the placement of room air conditioners as well . Always mount room-AC units on the shady side of the house , or otherwise shade them from the direct sun . For that matter , when selecting roof shingles or house paint , remember that light colors reflect sunlight and thus heat . Finally , use awnings , drapes , or shades on windows that receive direct sunlight , to reduce heat gain inside the house .

These fans , like roof vents , are easily installed . They more than pay for themselves in the savings from reduced energy consumption. * Dwight Gooden continued from page 55 securing outs and treating his arm respectfully . " You should not only pace yourself , but not try doing anything spectacular that 's not you , " he says quietly . " You should just try to be yourself . Do the things within your style that you 've been doing , not try to be like somebody else , or live up to somebody else ' standards . Just go out and do the best you can . " Gooden 's success did not quite come overnight . At 21 he is an 18-year veteran of the game , his father says . " I grew up in ball and so did he , " explains Dan Gooden , who in 1956 forsook Georgia farm life to move to Florida . In rural Albany , Georgia , Dan had learned the game from his father , a 6 ' 5 " semipro pitcher who , Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years old Dan 's boy was playing catch with members of the Tampa Dodgers ; he rolled the ball to them because he had n't yet learned to throw . Before long he yearned to play for his father . His idol was a Detroit star , Al Kaline . " That was his dream , to play pro ball . Mine too , " Dan Gooden says . " That 's all he ever did , play ball . No paper route , no nothing . lust play ball . That 's why people say he 's so advanced for his age , because baseball is all he knew . " When Dwight was 11 , he began playing Little League ball under the tutelage of Lucius Leonard , a former Tampa Dodgers player , who taught him to throw a curve . In Gooden 's first outing , he struck out 13 batters . He later played for his father in senior league on a team that won a national title . By his junior year in high school , Gooden " really did n't need much coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , but not to the point that we changed his mechanics pitching delivery . His mechanics were so good . " From the first , his poise and self-control made him what the Mets ' general manager , Frank Cashen , calls continued on page 95 Dwight Gooden continued from page 91 " the exception to all the rules as we know them . " Consequently , Gooden is unlikely to suffer the same hardships that befall lesser players . " Getting to the ballpark is the only thing he 's got to worry about , " says Al Jackson , the Mets ' minor-league pitching coach . The Mets ' field manager , Dave Johnson , had a hard time persuading Cashen to promote Gooden to the majors after the teen-ager had spent only one full season in the minors . But Gooden 's rare gifts wore down the resistance of the cautious GM . " The two things that he had that we do n't see in young pitchers is complete command and complete composure , " Cashen says . " He had command not only throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and he had a major-league curve ball right away . He had composure in that he did n't let a setback or a base hit or something defeat him . He was able toshrug it off and go on . " Others warn fretfully of pitfalls facing the young superstar . Already he has missed banquets honoring him in Tampa and in New York and has shown up late for appointments and practices . " As fast as he went up , he can come down just as fast , " Dan Gooden says . " He understands that . I talk to him about that all the time : Do n't ever let yourself get too big . " Mets ' executives have ordered that Gooden be protected somewhat from the press . Access to Gooden is limited to a mass press conference held the day after he pitches . Concerned in part about his frequently terse answers , the club also paid a media consultant to instruct Gooden and several others on how to handle the ever present reporters ( with whom he 's unfailingly polite ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' R ' Us , Spalding gloves , Kellogg 's Corn Flakes , and Polaroid ; collaborating on two autobiographies ; and appearing in a music video . Neader insists , " I do n't think hedoes that much at all . We could do ten times as much and saturate the market if we wanted to . We just do n't do it . " Gooden , remarkably unchanged by all the commotion , still calls his father after pitching a game and dwells on the details if he loses . During spring training he finds time to attend virtually every one of Hillsborough High 's games . He still lives in Tampa with his parents , in a new house he bought for them , though he plans to move out this fall when he marries Carlene Pearson , whom he met at church four years ago . As Gooden emerged from an interview session this spring , Johnson called out , " Do n't let baseball interfere with anything you 've got going . " Given Gooden 's love for the game , that 's unlikely to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already comparing him with the greatest pitchers baseball has seen . " It makes me feel weird , " Gooden admits . " That 's like every time you take the field you 've got to win , you 've got to strike out ten batters and almost pitch a shutout . " Then again , considering Gooden 's accomplishments to date , it 's difficult not to expect greatness each time he takes the mound . As this season began , he had struck out ten or more batters in 26 of his 66 major-league starts . Eleven times he held the opposition scoreless for an entire game . Only once last season , and nine times overall , did he give up more than three earned runs in a single game . He averages more than one strike-out per inning . During his career , he has fanned more batters than have reached base on hits and walks combined . " He 's way ahead of any young pitcher in the history of the game , " // Johnson says . " Just write superlatives . " X Fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seminars , writes outdoor articles , and serves as a professional guide  --  all in devotion to his favorite pursuit of finding and catching crappie . " Crappie are the king of panfish , " Steve proudly says . " They are found in every state , from small farm ponds to huge rivers , and are the most sought-after species of fresh-water game fish . " Not only are crappie abundantly available throughout the United July/August ' 86 States , but the panfish feed consistently throughout the year . " Unlike their neighbors of the underwater world , like bass , catfish , and bluegill , crappie habits place them on a year-round feeding spree , " Steve explains . " They do n't fall into a dormant stage . Thus , sport fishermen capitalize on the crappie 's year-round feeding habitats , with techniques ranging from ice fishing in Minnesota to drifting patterns in Florida . Crappie will strike a bait every season of the year , but anglers must learn to change methods and move with the fish . " Crappie are closer to the shoreline during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bank fishermen can harvest a full stringer , Steve suggests , by fishing around the roots and limbs of trees , bushes , and weed beds , where the fish are laying their eggs . " If hunting for the best lakes in the country , " Steve points out , " you 'll have to consider some of the larger , man-made reservoirs of the Tennessee Valley and through the Mississippi Delta . However , both sides of the Mason-Dixon tine offer excellent crappie fishing . " What signs on a body of water hint at great crappie fishing ? " Some of the ingredients for the recipe of above-average crappie fishing are lakes with moderate climates , shallow-to-average depths of 8 to 12 feet , stained water , and an abundant habitat for spawning , " Steve says . Steve McCadams , no stranger to crappie success , follows some general guidelines when stalking the spunky sunfish : " Successful anglers know that versatility is the key for consistent angling . Moving with the fish and reading sonar equipment is very important , " Steve suggests . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to utilize electronic devices like sonar , graph recorders , and liquid-crystal screens to monitor movement of the fish and submerged structures , like brush and stump rows . " The type of bait used relates to the environment you are fishing . " From the strip pits of Indiana to the shallow grass beds of Florida 's Lake Okeechobee , a fisherman can utilize a variety of techniques where both artificial and live bait are used , " Steve says . " Rubber-skirted jibs , which mimic bait fish , are quite popular and
