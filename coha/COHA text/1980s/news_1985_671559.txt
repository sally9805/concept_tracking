" Folks were saying the city is dead , " the Mayor said , remembering when he took office four years ago . " There was no hope for Camden. " // In some ways , this is still a desperate city . Camden officials estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of the 82 , 500 people who live here survive on some form of public assistance . Unemployment in some neighborhoods is 50 percent , according to the Mayor , Melvin R. Primas Jr . And with 22 murders in 1984 , the city ' s homicide rate is almost four times the national average. // In recent years , the population was fleeing , falling more than 17 percent between 1970 and 1980 . Students were dropping out of schools or failing at rates much higher than those elsewhere . More than a third of the population , which is predominantly black or Hispanic , lived below the national poverty level . And if there was a metaphor for all of this , Jeanne Anne Wright provided it . <> <> Words Etched in Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25-year-old woman made her way to a concrete platform by the edge of the Cooper River near midnight on Nov. 10 , 1983 , and slipped her four children , ages 11 months to 7 years , into the cold water. // A county prosecutor said the killings had reflected " the pathos in which these people lived , the pathetic nature of their existence . " It was as if the words of Proverbs , etched into the stone on the side of City Hall , had finally been fulfilled : " When there is no vision , the people perish. " // But these words have a different meaning here now . Plans have been set for major development along the Delaware River waterfront - a $194 million project on 75 acres that is to include improvements to the headquarters of the Campbell Soup Company and an engineering plant of the RCA Corporation. #3 to 5 Years for First Phase The State Sports and Exposition Authority is to build an aquarium on the tract . Near it , officials say , there will follow a restaurant , a marina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing , shops and a promenade that will be a site for outdoor festivals. // Once financing is set , the first phase of the project is to take three to five years to complete . The plan is being hailed here as the seed from which a new city will grow , a centerpiece , like Baltimore ' s harbor area , to lure the middle class back to Camden. // Already , there are small signs of change , small signs , as Mayor Primas put it , that " the pot is simmering. " // A new transportation center for bus and rail lines is under construction downtown . Rutgers University is building a dormitory on its campus off Cooper Street , heretofore limited to commuters . An industrial laundry moved across the river from Philadelphia . A company that builds limousines settled here . A new 190 , 000-square-foot warehouse was built . And new two-bedroom , two-bath town house apartments are now renting for $435 a month. // No one here tries to hide the city ' s problems . For every town house or row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Center , there are likely three to five others in the city that are boarded up and desolate . For every street that is swept clean , there is a neighborhood full of garbage and debris. // But these days Camden is a place of rising expectations , pinning its hopes on the region ' s economic boom and its plans on now-familiar formulas that have made for success elsewhere . <> <> Role of Nonprofit Agency // The first of these is the so-called public-private partnership and a nonprofit agency to move it forward . In Camden it is called the Cooper ' s Ferry Development Association - a coalition of the city ' s industries , institutions and political leaders who are developing the city ' s waterfront . The director of the association is Thomas Corcoran , a former business administrator at City Hall. // Like other nonprofit agencies after which it is patterned , the association developed plans for the site , arranged financing and will monitor the construction. // Mr. Corcoran says he believes the association will be successful where other groups here have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is political stability in City Hall and because Campbell Soup and RCA , the city ' s two major industries , have " made a major commitment to the city. " // He estimates that when all phases of the project are completed in 10 years , it should create almost 4 , 000 permanent jobs , encourage investment in the adjacent business district and change the image of the city , both in the minds of those who are lured here for the first time and those who never left. // " People have waited a long time for this to happen , " he said . " There ' s a real core of believers here . " <> <> An Informed Skeptic // Among them is a man whose job it is to be an informed skeptic , Michael H. Lang , a professor of urban studies and community developement at Rutgers here and director of the school ' s Forum for Policy Research and Public Service. // " I ' m not going to be starry-eyed and say the middle-class population is going to come running back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , minority-dominated city with a host of problems . But there is a slow climb back . There ' s real optimism here. " // Mr. Lang links Camden ' s chances for revitalization to development and gentrification in Philadelphia . He reasons that as housing becomes more expensive in Philadelphia - which is only 15 minutes away by car or train - Camden will become a more attractive place for professionals to live. // Like Mayor Primas , Mr. Lang says the city must attract middle-class professionals for both their capital and social presense. // " I ' m a firm believer that cities have to be balanced , " he said . " If this remains a reservation for the poor , there ' s no hope , no role models , no one for the next generation to rub shoulders with . The number of poor people here is the biggest problem the city has. " // Statistics , of course , do not accurately reflect the plight of the poor here or show how badly the social fabric has been damaged . <> <> View From Soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , " Tom Knoche said . " People come here crying because their son is going to jail or someone stabbed their sister or somone has just gotten thrown out of their house. " // Mr. Knoche and his wife run a soup kitchen in a worn and sagging section of the city known as North Camden . He arrived here 10 years ago , a former official in Baltimore who came to believe that welfare and government programs for the poor were destroying their self-esteem and industry. // Now he serves one hot meal a day , six days a week , to those who wander into Leavenhouse , as he calls his kitchen and dining room in an old row house on State Street. // " The city needs to be working with those who are here instead of putting all its eggs into the repopulation basket , " he said . " When you bring in so-called decent people with money what happens to those who are left ? " // In large part , Mr. Knoche and other spokesmen for the poor have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city was once strong with community and neighborhood groups . While many still function , their influence has waned. // In years past , the groups were a political buffer between City Hall and the demands of the economically disenfranchised . <> <> Closing the Spigot // " When I was first elected in 1981 , " Mr. Primas said , " the spigot from the Federal Government was wide open . Seven or eight community groups of various levels of effectiveness and quality were getting money . Thirty cents out of every dollar they got was going to housing and 70 cents was going to administration . I had to turn that around. " // City Hall now administers the Federal money - $3. 8 million a year in block-grant funds , less than in previous years . For 1986 , officials say , they expect a 10 to 20 percent cut in Federal grants . The money under city stewardship is used to renovate about 100 homes a year and to repair others. // Mr. Primas , who is the city ' s first black Mayor , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groups . This year , he was re-elected. // " There was an unrealistic expectation on the part of minority groups when I was elected , " he said . " They thought overnight things were going to change . They realize now you can ' t snap your fingers and overnight make well a town that has been on the decline for 30 years. " // During his first term , he made development his priority . During his second , he announced recently , he will concentrate less on major economic development and more on strengthening the city ' s 12 neighborhoods. // For example , he has promised to demolish every unsafe and dilapidated home within two years , to pursue absentee landlords who let their properties deteriorate , to insure that all new housing in the city will include " a fair share " for low- and moderate-income families . He has pledged to make all vacant units in public housing projects livable and available within a year and to consolidate all social services in one location. // " Yes , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now saying ' Maybe , maybe . ' The image is already changing. " //
