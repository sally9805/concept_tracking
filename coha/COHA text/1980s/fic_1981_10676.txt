" Director of the St. Louis Museum , I want you to meet the most promising young painter in America ! Just look at that masterpiece by the window , Maestro ; could n't you just reach out and eat that fruit it 's so real ? . . . " The artist Edmund 's work was most often compared to was Chardin . Pellucid tonalities , lyrically precise rendering , tight lustrous textures . Edmund enjoyed a mastery of the most ancient archaic recipes of the painter 's trade ; he found the modern world odious for its capitulation to immediacy , facility . He painted on wooden panels of five plies of maple to retain the full luminosity of old masters ' gesso techniques . He mixed his own grounds . He began by steeping two and three-quarters ounces of rabbit or hare 's skin glue in a quart of cold water ; the glue was soaked overnight and turned an opaque greenish-gray as it swelled to three times its volume . It had to be slowly heated in a double boiler ; he cooked his potions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the acrid smell , though she claimed it was pleasant ; he was ever amused and touched by her accommodations . The glue was poured into a pot containing the chalk or whiting , stirred continually for an hour , strained through several layers of cheesecloth . After brushing the mixture onto his panels Edmund completed the smooth ivory perfectionof his painting ground by rubbing it down with several differentgrades of sandpaper . He used imprimaturas of pale Venetian red mixed with egg yolk , rendered his values in umber and white before applying any further color . His portraits of the ebullient Sophie were brooding , imposing , reflective . " Richter 's paintings achieve their classic character by their virtuosity of execution and an emotional detachment remarkable in an artist of so young an age Sophie could not run their menage without bringinghome six bottles of wine at a time , five pounds of peaches , three armfuls of flowers .

" She swooped with equal appetite upon the latest tidbits of quantumphysics , jazz history , Marxist analysis , social biology ; her weight had as much variety as her information , her mercurial body waned by scores of pounds as she dove into another week-long fast of grapefruit or papaya . On other days when she sat cross-legged on the floor gorging on her favorite creme brulee , Edmund saw in her the lustful conniving impulsive child he cherished more than any of her personae , the fat greedy kid who needed to savor down to the last lick every delectable tidbit of opera , friendship , literature , ballet , anthropology , swimming fests , haute cuisine . She was phenomenallyindustrious ; Edmund insisted they share their rent and refuse Larry 's magnanimous offers of support ; though none of her jobs lasted for more than a few months she 'd accepted Edmund 's decisionthat she must " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance at a trade school in the Bronx . She previewed shows for a TV magazine . She volunteered at the Upper West Side Democratic Club . She decided she might have a flair for fashion and became a lingerie buyer at Bonwit 's . She rebelled against the decadence of that and worked at a welfare center in Harlem . She 'd been the star of Ethel Walker 's swimming team , she swam fifty laps of an Olympic-sized indoor pool daily to stay in shape . When she 'd saved enough of her earnings to stop working for a few months she studied African dancing with Katherine Dunham . " Oh God , Soph , what next , " Edmund moaned as she returned from each novel foray with a torrent of praise about its possibilities . " But E.R. you 've known since the age of five you wanted to be an artist , the rest of us have to find ourselves . . . .

" Now that finally is a great idea ; you 're a born journalist , Soph ,  |p102you  've got a mind for news like no one else . " She had the obsession of all modern youth , she wanted him to remember her as his life 's greatest lover . Candlelight , fresh flowers , Coquilles St. Jacques , Pouilly-Fuisse , the art books she collected for him on the coffee table , the wide deep bed , her Tiffany glass shimmeringlike harem silks , Brahms playing softly in the background , the rituals of undressing , shall I dim the lamp sweetheart , would you rather in the dark . . . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his simultaneous independence from it ; her touch stirred him with ravishing instantaneity , he pounced upon her with such tenderness that she often thought she 'd achieved the heat and beauty of ideal passion . But over the months she realized that the impulse had to come from her and her alone , otherwise he 'd go to sleep , his eyes staring at the ceiling until they closed . She continued her tactics of discretion , diplomacy : he could have been trying to allay his recent sorrow , dreaming of his own future glory , thinking of the canvas he wished to prepare for the next day , having an occasional thought about Claire , she never asked . Her sexuality was industrious , intense , she studied the newest manuals meticulouslyto memorize directives for novel positions and sensations , she rehearsed her sensuality like a summa-cum student cramming for exams , she turned and twisted on her artist , alternating largo with moderato vivace as she thrust down upon him at a fabulous variety of angles , riding astride his pensive body like a jockey trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian temple sculpture , mounted Edmund upon a corner of the bed and moved her haunches fervently upon his as she made him sit up with her legs locked about his waist . She put her mouth to him and circled her tongue languidly about the tip of his sex , one of her most perfectmoments was to hear him comment on her artistry , yet one morning she woke up crying . " You never grab me in the middle of the night , " she wept , " how can you love me if you do n't wake me sometimes ? " In the winter of 1953 Edmund finished his master 's thesis , " The Concept of Artistic Genius from the Renaissance to Our Time . "  |p103The  artist is the man viewed as most dangerous to Plato 's Republic precisely because he partakes of so much Godliness , because his poetic gifts are the result of divine possession and the making of his painted forms so arrogantly imitative of the Creator 's own work . .. .

Hooligan and seer , heretic inebriate and scapegoat for our sins , he will continue to be held as the complex object of our derision , envy , love ... . Most reviews of Edmund Richter 's exhibition of November 1954 praised his " masterful control of naturalistic drawing , " his " formidable skill for working with veiled transparencies of color . " " In an age when the slapdash sham of nonobjectivism seems to be swamping the New York art world , Richter offers a **25;8263;TOOLONG of the realistic tradition . . . . " A few periodicalswere less favorable . In an issue that featured a monumental Franz Kline abstraction on its cover ARTnews admitted to Richter'svirtuosity but dismissed his work as " complaisant oils depictingstrong and pretty women in a nostalgically realistic style that could have been achieved anytime in the past one hundred years .

If that 's the direction it 's all taking I 'm pulling out ! " There were always those parties for him at the Rosses . Sophie still cringed whenever he criticized her family . " Was n't that the niftiest do last night , do n't you think Larry Tibbett is sure to buy that big still life of yours ? " " Listen , Soph , one more mention of those artist-gobbling talent mongers I meet at your family 's and I 'll puke .

" Damn this business of art , Soph ; in all that 's useless one must be divine or cease altogether .. . . " When she did n't understand his meaning she gave him one of those smiles that made all other women 's smiles pale in comparison ; she had spectacular teeth , a little prominent but small and finely modeled , with a cleavage between the two front ones which she adored to hear him say was a traditional mark of great sensuality . He admired the firm ampleness of her flesh , its Rubenesque paleness , her patience . Patience ! How often he 'd felt her eyes upon his throughout the night ( pale , the color of lightning ) like the eyes of small hungry animals piercing the darkness one sees in drought-stricken country .

Sophie reclining by the pool , ogled by all men in sight , displaying her majestic milky flesh , the luxuriance of her underarms . . . Edmund sunning himself between the two women , wondering what he would do with himself the following year . Lying beside Sophie at nights Edmund often tried to recall those black days after his mother 's death when he could n't even remember the pet name of that other beloved young woman who 'd never left his side . What are those inanimate objects after which wealthy Gentiles call their daughters , he 'd kept muttering during his illness , Muffin , Fiddle . . . Fern . . . Brook . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brook ? A curious thing had happened in the months of 1954 . Edmund began to draw and paint multiples of Sophie . He could not invent any more poses for her . He sensed he had explored and exhausted the total entity of that patient malleable body . He was now painting her repeatedly in the same identical pose , arm under head , knees chastely drawn up , eyes not cast down on a book anymore but staringout of the canvas with a haunted , intelligent gaze . He simply did the same painting over and over and over again , varying only thep106tonality of the undercoat  --  raw umber , terre verte , sienna , red ocher , grisaille . During the week , when she was out working , he used the same principle of repetition in his still lifes . He painted preciselysimilar arrangements of vase , fruit , tablecloth in multiples of four , eight , sixteen , thirty-two canvases .

I hope your Oxonian studies are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do when I have the courage to travel alone again is to visit the Ashmolean down the street from you , three Brueghels of unsurpassed beauty right there . . . . I 've had a super year selling out two shows and indulging in the prehensile hospitality of the Ross clan . Listen , that talent-gobblingworld of the Big Apple is getting to be more exhausting than ever . Consumption of artists a sacrament of success , like fatness for tribal chieftains . Will you eat your artist now or shall I wrap him for you ? I 've been consumed as artist la Creme , sauteed with walnuts , boiled and fried ( a recipe I frequently have to impose on myself in order to survive ) . Sophie 's sweet as hell and very sexy , whatever that means . I feel like a bejeweled stud , like one of those bulls the Egyptiansdeified and embalmed near the pyramids of Giza . . . . So that 's how I am . It 's seldom that I write you , of course , without inquiring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card last year . It 's so hard to know how she is , with Babsie and Plinker in Arizona . I hear that Sealark is rented for a three-year term what with Babsie so ill and that she 's feebler than usual . News please ! Shall we ever see our Paradiso again ? Listen lifesaver , stay well and do know that there 's always a daybed in our living room for you ; we 've moved three blocks east to Charles Street , with a large studio skylight this time , quite out of Puccini . . . . Best always , etc . Edm . At times Edmund and Sophie looked at slides of Nantucket together : Jeff in his Harvard-crew shirt , coach 's whistle about hisp107neck , masterminding a volleyball game at Sealark . Babsie with a spray of rosemary and zinnias in hand , looking surprised . Eighteenyear-oldPebble embracing her father as he hovers over his vegetablegarden , her face nestled in his shoulder . Once Edmund caught Sophie staring at the picture of Claire with an expression of fascination , passion , anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street in the late evening when Edmundincreasingly walked out for a few hours to be alone : whistling of cabs , garrulous voices from the Cedar Bar , brushes and canvases stacked up in the window of an artist supplies ' store as in an ossury . One night he started his first postcard to Claire in almost three years while leaning against a streetlamp . He addressed it Angelface , tore it up , threw it into the trash basket in front of the Women 's House of Detention . He often feared that he forced Sophie to pose as much as he did to allay her devouring solicitude , to halt her invasion of him . So he started their weekend poses early in the morning , made her sit until the moment they had to get dressed for the opera or the Habima Players . When would this beauty exchange the happiness she knew with him for some prolific maternity ? He would go to visit her , a decade hence , in some vintage New England mansion . There 'd be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Finnish nannies for her children , first editions , poets in residence , pedigreed Weimaraners , a kind and philanthropic Wall Street husband hoveringadmiringly in the background . Increasingly voluptuous of body , she would stand over Edmund at the poolside , calling out the year 's purchases and accomplishments , her chairmanship of the Connecticut Democratic Party Committee , her rescue of three community theaters . He would lie in the sun and softly whisper , " You plague me with your abundance , you plague me with . . . Her smell of rose water and moist animal fur . Her nimble loving hands repairing his shirts , massaging his neck , whipping up delicate mousses in their little kitchen . At times he adored her . The threat of her flesh and of his growing anguish on winter weekend afternoons , when the waning light of early dusk forcedp108him to stop painting at four o'clock . . . listening then to Mozart or just talking , his head on her lap , pleading that his eyes were too strained to do anything else . . . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening ; like many men 's sisters she was the central anchor of his life and its most perfect constancy ; how often he wished that she could have been his sister . . . but such a fantasy would have been offensive to her , totally beyond her understanding . . . so he talked about his fears of being an artist behind his time , perhaps he was a born teacher like they said Jeff was . . . . " No , never , never ! " she cried at such prospects and he realized he was threatening something as sacred to her as her faith in great passions . .. . Early in the spring of 1955 he purchased a Siamese cat . He called it Vico . " If only I could start everything all over again , " Edmund said to himself , aged twenty-four . During that last year with Sophie , Edmund developed a habit of sleeping away his moments of acute distress . Sleep was his refuge , his haven , his exile from all decisions . Living with this admirable woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleep until two o'clock of the following afternoon , paint for a few hours , go to bed and sleep again until ten o'clock the next morning . Upon his last show he was interviewed by Newsweek and several other periodicals . He enjoyed saying things like " Great painting nourishes the soul . " Others of his answers were cryptic , ornery , tended to amuse reporters . " You 're presently the boy wonder of the New York art world , but do n't you fear you might be painting against the tide of fashion ? " " The artist 's business is with eternity , not costume . " LondonAsh Wednesday , 1955Sophie darling . . . how joyful to put your dear name down on paper again . . . . I just finished writing Plinker and Babsie and telling them how profoundly I 'm beginning to miss the States after this almost threep109years ' absence . . . .

However I caught a frightful pneumonia and was laid up for almost three months with it , which is why I failed to send you proper season 's greetings . . . . I might have been in very bad shape if Jeff had n't come to the rescue with a decent doctor , I was so far gone that they kept me in hospital for weeks where I got all kinds of lectures about the dangers of vegetarianism etc . . . . There was that first week when Jeff said it was really hit or miss . . . .

A big hug to you and our rabbit love and tell him I 'll write him myself very soon . . . . The quality of Sophie 's flesh : on the best days Rubenesque in its sumptuous whiteness , like milk or whey , utterly luminous . .. on other days her flesh seemed to take on the hues of fruit gone too ripe , like Renoir 's late nudes , which he had come to detest . Suddenly at 5:0o A.M. on a spring morning in 1955 , it was a Saturday , he ran out of their flat and ran all the way to Fourteenth Street and then up to Pennsylvania Station ; he sat down in the first train he saw without having the slightest notion of where it was going , it took him all the way to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , where there was nothing to do but take a guided tour of the Hershey chocolate factory , he was the only adult not accompanied by a child , it was just a week before Easter and acres of liquid chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stood over the ocean of brown ooze and wept because he was reminded of Mara 's extravagantEaster feasts . ( " Every man is born , " she used to say , " but outside of Him who else had the imagination to rise again ? " ) He weptp110thinking of the eggs she 'd painted in such delicate silken hues , of the Russian princes sitting over their pascha and koulitch and swallowingsmall teaspoons of raspberry jam while sipping tea from tall glasses . . . When he returned the next day Sophie was in bed reading , smiling , bravely pretending she had n't cried , cheek resting against her childhood fetish . The following morning he was finally able to write a postcard : New York City April 4th , 1955 Sweetest Claire ! Do you realize what a horror show it would be if you did n't take care of yourself and got to the Harp Farm ahead of schedule , ca n't you just see the hundreds of jerks who would come to your funeral , your great-uncles from Detroit and all your lousy reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob of them Cousin April with her Locust Valley lockjaw saying " yes dearie , it 's so nice to see you dearie , " and do n't tell me that scene would be nifty , kind of neat , delish , swell , keen or crackerjack , it would be strictlylousy , nothing but a floppola . . . . Oh Angelface write me which boat or plane you 're taking . . .  |p111SEALARK  'S summer tenants obligingly vacated the house a week early for Claire 's late summer wedding , which remained a very small and private affair because of her mother 's death that spring . Standing at the front door upon arriving , Edmund watches Plinkerhovering at the gate of the abandoned garden . He has not seen him in over three years , since the weeks after Mara 's funeral . Plinkerwears heavy spectacles . He has just turned sixty-five . His eyesightis said to have been failing . His face has turned an unhealthily yellow hue that could be the combined legacy of age and strong sun . He stares at the abandoned , weed-filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable growing of lettuces and zinnias , he looms tall and scowling at the garden gate , cane in hand , as if planning the reconquest of his domain . Edmund starts to walk toward his friend . It takes Plinker a while to recognize him . He puts on another pair of spectacles as Edmund approaches him and the gesture is as grand and lonely as that of a sea captain raising his binoculars to identify a distant vessel . He 's recognized Edmund , he hobbles majestically towards him , arms outstretched , half yelling , half growling his ancient jibes and greetings . Passionately fond of young Europeans ! Does Eddem remember all the times he 'd been sick on his sailboats ? Remember that time when he got poor Babsiep112so upset during the Game ? Remember that afternoon Peb disappeared in the dunes and they ended up searching for Eddem too in the fire truck ? Oh does Edmund ever remember . Well , what else could you have done but let that garden go to weed ? What would have been the use of keeping Sealark open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people grown , and Claire away on one of her crazy searches in England ? Thank God , at least that was over , Jeff had brought her safely out of it , that 's one consolationPlinker has had since Babsie 's death ; now Plinker could finally plan his next few years of retirement ; they 'd rent Sealark for another few summers and he 'd go back to Arizona  --  splendid golf club out there , a lot of fellows of his own kind , knockout place for the glums . And in a few years when the Howells returned from England he could move back to New York , live at the Harvard Club in winter and help reopen Sealark in summer ; by that time there might be one or two little Howells to help out with , right ? There 'd be a new generation to enjoy good summer fun , a lot more beach picnics and clambakes . . .

Is he making friends in his new life , always very important to pick the proper friends at his age .... " I wish you were my father , " Edmund says . Paul Sanford takes his long-distance spectacles off slowly and puts on the other pair , staring at Edmund with curiosity . Edmund turns around abruptly and walks back to the house . Plinker looming at the altar , crying as he gives his daughter away . Edmund has not seen Claire either since he accompanied her to the Queen Elizabeth three years ago . She has not grown any thinner , thank God , and her body is hued that pale tint of honey from her few days ' stay at Sealark . Her hair is longer and very lank , surpris/ingly unkempt for this occasion . Her superb face is as untainted by makeup as when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given no thought to her appearance .

They stand at the reception line . Claire wears her grandmother 's wedding dress . Sophie , maid of honor , wears a gossamer number shot through with blue-and-green iridescence , like a pheasant 's plumage . She lifts her arm to adjust Claire 's wedding veil , the two women clutching at each other in a long embrace , the flesh of Sophie 's underarms pale as alabaster . Claire 's breath on his cheek as he kisses her : like that of a child being put to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiles . Cincinnati , Atlanta , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , each weddinggift shines roundly on a long table , objects she 'd rebelled against since childhood , Spode , lace tablecloths , Tiffany silver .

April to Edmund , wry little smile : " What a dull wedding , dearie , this place is dismal with poor Babsie gone . " Sophie : " She 's done the only thing Plinker wanted her to do , marrying Jeff . " Someone tinkled at the piano , Plinker perhaps , a bit of Cole Porter . As the piece ended , Edmund saw Claire rise and clap , smiling adoringly at her father , and again there was something rigid , Teutonicallyobedient about her frail little torso , like that of a toy doll spinning under a little glass dome . She scared him anew then , with her dual quality of obedience and rebellion . How splendid Jeff looked as they cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fairly added to his stature .

Perennial coach , eternal husband , docile consumer of all that 's sold to us as happiness . . . . Claire , on the other hand , did not fit in . She was dreaming , staring out to sea as she had when Edmund found her hiding in the dunes of their adolescence , steeped in some communion with God knew what . " We 're cutting the cake , Claire , " Jeff said . And took her wrist and made her grasp the knife and strike it into the heart of the pearly white mound . He smiled and put his mouth to Claire 's cheek . She waved her hand at the camera . There was a look of triumph on Jeff 's face which Edmund decided had something brutal about it . He hated him .

He stripped off his clothes and dove into the bay . He swam furiously towards the goldand-blackhull of a yacht still called The Churchill moored several hundred yards out at sea . That Muse with whom he 'd hoped since childhood to share the struggles of an artist 's life . . . He was terrifiedby the helplessness of his desire and of his rage , by the threat of capitulations still to come . I am now obliged to deal with certain unsufferable certainties .

I 'm enough of a traditionalist to believe that the function of religion and of art is to help transcend the pains of life and make bearable the cruelty and senselessness of nature , that the task of the artist is to infect others with his emotions towards reality .

I keep thinking of the plenitude I abandonedwhen I left you ; I also think of how things would have developedif we 'd followed the luxuriant course of the past years . I remain content with my decision because of the glum predictability such a life would bring : I would have ridden the surf for a few years in that talentdevouringcafeteria of your father 's which contaminates rather than alleviates the artist 's solitude . . . we would have led an " interesting life , " which is the ideal of many idiots . . . . Irwin Shaw , Ray Bolger , Oscar Hammerstein and whatever brilliant professors you pick up in your varied courses of study would have turned up at our first child 's baptism . . . within a few years I 'd be filled with the jaded singsong of an artist radically out of step with his time . . . .

Have you ceased dedicating your life to a member of the male sex ? Are you being less generous , more self-centeredwith your admirable energies ? Have you quit thinking that fuckingartists is going to lead you to a higher state of reincarnation ? All these conditions must be met my darling if you 're going to find the happiness you deserve . There are too many rich little Jewish girls around whose greatest dream is to marry an artist when they grow up and when they 're twenty-one their daddy buys them the largest toy artist at F. A. O.

More very soon my darling , I 'll be watching for your syndicated by-line in the Daily News ! Moderato , with sincerity Edm . BerkeleyJanuary 4th , 1956 Beloved Sofia Larionovna , I miss you as desperately as ever ; I feel I owe you a still clearer reading of why I had to flee the dreadful power of your family 's protection . I 'll start with the following incident : It was the fourth anniversary of Mara 's death last week , and suffering a deeper solitude than I 've ever known , determined to suffer through it stoically , I went to Mass for the first time in many years and watched people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is to eat the God . I suddenly grasped , with unprecedented clarity , the power of our unending desire to devour the Godhead and its symbols . How did tragedy and all other art arise ? Out of religious sacrifice , out of the universal need to both placate and consume that which is most sacred and to appropriate part of its power . And I understood that it is the artist 's risk , precisely because he has a trace of the divine in him , to be in some way destroyed by society . Take it from there ; what happens in a society as profoundly desacralizedas ours ! It has nothing godly to consume anymore except the artist ! Oh Sofka will the world ever resolve its curious ambivalence of love , envy , appetite , hatred for us ! What duplicitous ways you 've found to destroy us , either by letting us starve ( as we did in our **27;8317;TOOLONG garrets ) or else by devouring us ( as you presently threaten to do ) . Well I 'll tell you kiddo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's most terrifying of all is our willingness to sacrifice ourselves for you to resolve your ambivalence , to purge you of your hatred and earn your exclusive affection and esteem . Oh , we 'll do anything to forge your love , in life and in death , we 'll destroy ourselves in drugs like Verlaine , we 'll drown ourselves in booze like Scott Fitzgerald and Dylan Thomas , we 'll do anything to satisfy the myths you create for us . And you wait and see sweetheart it 's going to get worse and worse with your dad 's spectaculars glamorizing our destruction , we 'll alternatebeing buffoons and media martyrs , Truman Capote will pull his pants down and piss right on television , Irwin Shaw will buy a fistfight with Larry Rivers on the Jack Paar show ; by the 1980s the expiatory devouring act will be brought directly into your living room , ladies and gentlemen ; artists will commit suicide right on the idiot box to keep your love . Hoc est enim Corpus meum right on the telly kiddo . Oh Soph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To return to what I wrote you a few months ago : I hope that my turn will come again ; that we shall once more be capable of celebrating the beauty of the created world ; and also of preserving our sanity by holding society at bay as a worthy adversary instead of capitulating to its greed . Until that day I 'm using the most expedient recipe yet found for the artist in our times : " Exile . Silence . Cunning . "  |p123UPON  arriving at Kiev from Georgia , Edmund , Sophieand Claire are taken to see the statue of Prince Vladimir , founder of Russia 's oldest city . His statue stands among tall beeches at the site where he once offered Slays the choice between Christianbaptism and death by drowning . At least that is the way Evgenytells it . Below Saint Vladimir , the Dnieper flows the color of flawed amber , russet beeches lean towards it like penitents from shoals of dirty sand ; nothing special here in the way of bathing , Sophie comments , let 's not even try it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town Irina points to an eighty-nine-room palace built in three days to comply with the whims of the second-to-last czarina , who never set foot in it , after all . Eighty-nine rooms never used , all that money , labor at the expense of the Russian people ! A few members of the Intourist group ask if they can visit Babi Yar , burial place of over a hundred thousand persons killed by German occupationforces . Evgeny stands mute at the request , swatting flies with his copy of a folded Pravda . Do n't even think of it , Irina says , that 's over an hour from Kiev , farther than any cab accepts to go , so . . . visit impossible . But Edmund gets a few taxis on his own . And the Americans get to Babi Yar with no problem , seeing it is in the center of the town , ten minutes from the hotel.  |p124At  Babi Yar a bronze monument now dominates a majestic ravinein which the victims lie buried . Arthur Zabar takes over as guide : During their occupation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to exterminate Ukrainian and Russian resisters . But the site was ignored until the early 196os when Yevtushenko made it famous in a poem : " There are no monumentson Babi Yar , A steep ravine is all , a rough memorial . " Soviet authorities have tried to suppress the fact that Jews were the first victims to be singled out at Babi Yar . Arthur Zabar thereuponputs on his yarmulke and reads a prayer in Hebrew from a little book covered in white vinyl which he keeps in his shopping bag . The Americans stand heads bowed for a few minutes , staring at the cenotaph . The sight is awesome . The tortuous summit of the bronze monument depicts a prisoner trying to burst from his chains . Even after thirty years the ground at Babi Yar remains brown and barren because of the massive chemical effect of quicklimepoured upon decomposing bodies . There are only a few shreds of dried flowers at the monument , Sophie notes ; visits must still be very rare , little will ever grow in this terrain . Claire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walkway and place them at the statue 's feet . " Ten minutes from the hotel door to door and they tell you it 's impossible , " Ethel Zabar says as she replaces her husband 's yarmulke in her shopping bag . " Accordingto that party slave who 's herding us around it was two hours out of town ! " Arthur Zabar exclaims . " What kind of human rights can you expect , " Claire asks , " in a country where lovely girls like that are forced to lie for a decent living ? " The next morning they take a plane to Leningrad . As they drive towards their hotel from the airport Edmund recognizes from his mother 's aquatints the yellow walls of the Smolny Institute which served as Bolshevik headquarters in 1917 . He has a recurring dream of Mara in which they walk down Leningrad 's streets looking for her childhood home near the Smolny ; they never succeed in finding it ; in successive dreams it 's been destroyed by Red troops , German artillery , has been superseded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Edmund wishes to grab Sophie 's armp125and tell her that Mara 's childhood home must be right near here , near the Smolny , but Sophie and Claire are arguing again with Evgeny about religion . A narcotic vagary doomed to disappear , Evgeny says , just as Karl Marx put it ! How can you say it 's disappearing , Claire protests , look at the babies being christened in your country , the churches often filled ! You take the Marx quote out of context , Sophie adds , he called religion " the heart of a heartless world , " and only then does he call it " the opium of the people . . . . " Evgeny smiles and compliments Sophie on her interestin Marx . At the back of the bus the Rolls-Royce dealers talk about their newly purchased balalaikas and the pleasures of the trip ; is n't it gorgeous traveling through a country where there 's no graffiti , no pornography on any walls ? Sophie has slept well and is in cheerful mood , banters with the Weickers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the average income of the Soviet factory worker . Edmund stares at the nursery-blue hues of St. NicholasCathedral , at the sumptuous lilac tints of the sky surrounding its gilt domes . These days he can not be exceptionally moved by a landscape or the hue of a wall without wondering what pigments he 'd have mixed to render it . " I do not know which to prefer , " he recently wrote Claire in a letter which he considered profoundly Slavic , " my suffering before or after the cessation of my art . It is not so much joy which leads us to paint or write but terror of our death , fear of not leaving enough claw prints on the dunes of time ; sorrow lies on either side , the act of art is strung between two poles of pain .. .. " The tenderness of St. Nicholas ' walls could be rendered in cobalt blue mixed with a very small dose of white , sky would need a trace of cobalt violet , church 's marble pilasters have a rose tint prone to alizarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most striking first impression ; what brutal history is cloaked with a more ambrosial palette , siege of the early 194os , men boiling leather briefcases into a sticky mass for their dinner , strippingoff wallpaper paste to get at its traces of potato flour , more dead of hunger than in any other city in history after Stalin 's purges had already carried off millions . Azure palaces , mourning mothers , icy foreheads of starving children , Shostakovich conducting top126packed houses , musicians ' breaths exhaling clouds of white fog in the freezing concert hall . . . . As the bus rumbles alongside the Neva , Edmund watches the first sun worshipers leaning against the cement of the river 's embankment ; in this most heroic of cities hundreds of survivors have stripped their bodies and lean against stone walls , eyes closed , lard-hued flesh begging for June 's first warming rays ; how many summers do they have left , how many do any of us have before it will be decidedly too late to find grace or rebecome what we could wish to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Evgeny 's spectaclesstill shield the curiosity he evidences towards Edmund 's party . " Ah yes Evgeny , my esteemed foremothers were suffering womenwho taught the harp to your grand duchesses .. .. " " My parents are dead also , " Sophie tells Evgeny , " they ruined my life and I loved them greatly ; do n't you think most parents have a way of destroying us in some symbolic way . . . oh I suppose you do n't subscribe to such Freudian ideas Evgeny Sergeievich ? " " Today gentlemen and ladies we are going to visit Fortress of Peter and Paul . . .. " The bus is loaded , ice-blue , packed with memories . Irina smiles at her flock , smooths her American jeans , switches on her little microphone . " On way to fortress I urge you please to notice famous Winter Palace Square , largest public space in world after People 's Square in Peking . . . . " Professor Richter is again assured that the group is scheduled to visit the Hermitage Museum on Monday of next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of Peter and Paul prison , forbidden to visit of public until the Revolution and surely not included in his 1915 Baedeker . " One of the first prisoners to be executed there was the only son of Peter the Great , who had rebelled against the czar 's reforms and was put to death by his father 's own hand . We shall also see the cells once inhabited by Dostoevski , Gorki , Kropotkin , Lenin 's brother , Alexsandr Ulyanov . . . " What do you propose to do about that dissident , Peb ? "  | " Everything I can obviously ; he 's on a hunger strike in one of the worst jails in Russia and I 'm trying to reach his friends ahead of time so I can arrange to meet them but I ca n't even get a phone connectionto Moscow . . . .

He 'd walked into Sophie 's room after a brief knock ; they were lying in a large double bed , Claire reading , half reclining on a pillow , Sophie bared to the waist , her head on Claire 's lap , trying to have a brief afternoon sleep , splendor of two women 's flesh joined in ancient affection , sensuality of sheets rumpled in great heat . " What 's new and exciting , Professor , what beautiful flowers you 've brought us ! " And then Claire had started discussing her mission again . " Since this damn tour only gives us four days in Moscow , I 've got to make some contacts ahead of time . . . . The tenacity of this Baklanov , thirty-five years old and he 's only been at liberty for fourteenmonths of his adult life . . . systematic hunger strikes to protestill treatment of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. " Edmund stares at the Neva flowing beneath their room , darkeningviolet in the early-evening light . To recreate the curious dark sweetness of that sky , like lilac blossoms about to unfurl ! A deep cerulean at this hour . The water a Prussian blue . Two women in black babushkas in an ocher yellow boat in the middle of the water . He toys with the pistil of a white tulip . " Peb take a rest for a change why do n't you ? Why ca n't you forget a bit about your missions on this trip ? " " Forget about my missions ! " Claire leaps up , paces the room . " When will you ever leave your alabaster tower , Edmund ! " " Now listen you 're not going to drop out of our tour and start getting followed by the KGB ; this is n't a country in which to exhibityour virtuosity at guilt Pebble ; you only have to be here for twop128days to realize that oppression is as great as it ever was under Peter the Great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hands . . . . " " What cynicism , Edmund , what does that have to do with my conscience , not a tinker 's dam ! " Her pale face made more inscrutable by its walls of straight brown hair , for years he 'd compared her to a medieval city-state , self-sufficient , impregnable . " It has to do with the fact that you 're a tourist of suffering , my dear , the way I 've become a tourist of art , the way our Rolls-Roycersare tourists of Russia , the way Sophie is a tourist of everything . You 've been saving asthmatic sea gulls since you were a child just to ease your damn little conscience .... " " Apologies for your own passivity ! " " If I wish to bury myself in the difficult task of reclaiming our friendship on this trip it 's my privilege to do so , so do n't try to make me feel guilty about being an inactivist who prefers to remain where it was at . . . . " " Please E.R. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languorously brushing her mass of copper hair , pacifying them with weary dutifulness . " You 're both behaving as if we were still at Sealark ; I did n't come on this trip to serve as some sort of Security Council . . . let 's not be late for dinner again and bring a sweater , Peb ... . " Edmund said other things as they walked to dinner through hallwayswalled in scarlet damask , hung with bright fairy tales and scenes of the Neva at every time of year . You pimp with your purity do n't you Peb , you know your problem sweetheart you 've been trying to be a saint much of your life but you wo n't make it because you only love that part of us that can be saved . . . saints are one of my favorite subjects , you ca n't help but be a specialist in saints when you 're an art historian , I collect them , I 'm an aficionado . . . . They 're tumblers of sorts , people who know how to turn one hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been abortive Peb , as if you 'd lost your balance in midair and landed aslant on the wrong foot . . . . She 'd walked ahead of him with her air of being unaccompanied and having no one to listen to ; he'dp129reflected on the dilemmas facing three persons in middle age who 've had a lifelong obsession for each other ; Sophie had followed close behind them , pretending to be buried in a Russian grammar . That evening the tourists are taken to see Leningrad'scircus on ice . Edmund , Claire and Sophie sit with the clappingZabars , the delighted Weickers , the gilded Rolls-Roycers among bands of round-cheeked Russian children . They watch seals dueling , clowns and poodles pushing baby carriages , trained bears in sky-blue skates playing hockey games . The youngest bear acts as goalie ; he swings smartly at the puck with his little stick when it comes near his cage ; when his wobbling ankles fail him the crowd cheers , the circus trainer rewards him with handfuls of fresh fish . There is much clapping and shouting among members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see romantic ending , " Irina promises . In the evening 's last act a ballerina in glistening white tutu whirls about the skating rink surrounded by a flock of trained white pigeons . She holds a large hoop through which the birds fly in and out , in and out , like planets gone berserk about the gravitation of a star , briefly settling on her hair , her wrists , her breasts . An acrobat in white satin pants glides into the arena , seizes the ballerina onto his shoulders . He holds the hoop while she makes her exquisite movements through it ; the ballerinanow circles about her partner like a luminous satellite , hair flying , stretching her limbs into great ecartes and arabesques . She stands on tiptoe on the hoop he holds , defying gravity , performing amazing gyrations in the air , and the pigeons become a third planetarycircle , still gliding about her body to settle briefly on her breasts , her wrists , her hair . " Three rings of light , " Edmund whispersto himself . Which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve on this trip with his life 's two loves . Their favorite time of day in Russia is after io:oo P.M. For after emerging from the ballet , the opera or whatever other spectacle they have been taken to they receive the guides ' permission to walk back to the hotel alone instead of returning by bus with the rest of the group . Dawn through the night , dawn until dawn , in Lenin/grad 's white nights the sun follows them like the KGB ; when they exit from the theater that night the buildings have sunk into a torpidhaze of dark fruit hues , the sun still throws a slice of pale gold across the rooftops of the bloodred Mariynsky , the lime-green Stroganoffpalaces . Still silent and trailing behind her friends Claire stops walking and sits alone by the edge of a canal . They are by the church built on the site of Alexander II 's assassination , its darklozengedbrilliance glints like coal in the light of night . " As the czar stepped out of his carriage a second bomb was thrown , the czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often in St. Petersburg the snow was red with blood . " Edmund stands by the embankment , wondering how long to let Claire brood alone . He walks to her and sits down by her side , his hand on her arm . And she buries her face in his shoulder for a minute . Edmund , Sophie and Claire walk through the city hand in hand again , talking about the islands , the games , the pains of their long adolescence . One detects no other serious tensions between them yet , not too many complications . They have loved each other long , their happiness in being together is as luminous as the white pageant they have just observed . It is the beginning of another beautiful Russian night.  |p131ON  a July afternoon in 1959 Edmund stands in Rome 's Villa Borghese Museum with a sheaf of notes scribbling some last thoughts on his doctoral thesis . He has chosen as his theme Titian 's painting Sacred and Profane Love , which depicts two beautiful young women who resemble each other like twins but differ vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast canvas is nude save for a white loincloth , the other protagonist is sumptuous in a gown of white-and-crimson satin ; they sit on the rim of a sculpturedmarble basin towards which a Cupid leans to stir the basin 's limpid water . Many precursors of Edmund 's labor had spent years of their lives debating the ironic symbolism of the women 's vestments  --  wasit the nude figure which Titian meant to embody Sacred Love , the vested one who personified profane and transient lust ? ( R. von Marie , Iconographie de 1'Art Profane au Moyen Age et a La Renaissance , The Hague , 1931 . ) Numerous scholars domiciled in Leipzig or Stanford had dedicated themselves to the single issue of dating the canvas ( 1514 ? 1515 ? Right before or after Titian left the workshop of his teacher Giorgione ? ) And a few doctoral candidates of Edmund 's unbridled ambition had elaborated on the paysages moralises depicted behind the two beauties  --  dark wooded hill dominated by forbidding fortress brooding behind the figure of Profane Love , serene verdant pasture surmounted by church steeplep132stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Tizian drucke , Leipzig , 1920 . ) Let 's not fuck up with our usual love of confrontation , E.R. , do n't strive for any revolutionary new views , always a risk as an opening aria . . . also avoid possibility of jealous positivists yiping against subjectively self-indulgent speculations . . . stay quiet , formal , earn the comments " impeccable , irrefutable " . . . just sum up most honorable findings to date and add some stirring insights of your own into Neoplatonism of Titian 's vision -- T 's central theme is the tension between two kinds of Venuses , two kinds of love : ( 1 ) Chaste Sacred Love , Amicitia , Caritas , that higher form of bonding only reached in deep but nonphysical relationships versus 2 ) Sensual Profane Love , which Romantic agonists later upheld as the central ingredient of happiness -- Brief elaboration needed on Renaissance 's revolutionary attitudes towardsnudity , its rejection of all medieval prejudices against the naked form  --  by 1515 the nude in art personifiesthe most exalted and spiritual attributes , Friendship , Genius , Soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studiesof Sacred and Profane  --  greatly stress general distrust of romantic passion throughout mainstream of Western philosophical tradition , right until nineteenth century 's disastrous glorification of it  --  up to then friendship ratherthan love was seen as cornerstone of human happiness  --  Aristotle : Transience and destructiveness of venerealappetites , capacity for friendship is only measure of human virtue/Cicero : Amicitia more valued than eitherpower , honor , wealth/Montaigne sums it up for the Renaissance a few decades after Titian paints Sacred and Profane : Love is " an impetuous and fickle flame , " whereas the fires of friendship produce " a gentle and universal warmth , moderate and even " While traveling through Italy in the summer of 1959 Edmund enjoys staying in those modest pensiones in which aging couples ,  |p133week  after week , keep bottles of mineral waters and amber medicineson their tables . There is an orderliness , a delectable monotony about such establishments which reflect the pace of his own recent life . An order from Napoleon Bonaparte issued on the occasion of a soldier committing suicide for love has hung over Edmund 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The First Consul notifies his Grenadiers that a soldier must conquer the pain and vulnerability of his passion . " Like many of us who 've known the ending of an ardent dream he 's come to think of himself as steeled and stoic , able to control all future lust . In such moments we may extend our disaffectionto the entire race , conceive for the future of our species a Utopian breed that will live in perfect control of all fleshy desireswhile tranquilly performing increasingly noble mental work . . . . During his years at Berkeley little emotion has stirred Edmund , save the bittersweet memory of three childhood friends he 's not yet dared to revisit and the blissful prospect of academic glory . He 's already spent much labor on , drawn much applause , for meticulously documented papers on the iconography of medieval ivories , on the disputed meaning of clocks ( reminders of life 's brevityor symbols of a rising middle class ? ) in seventeenth-century still lifer . " Recipe for academic success ? " he wrote Claire and Jeff shortlybefore leaving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those professors instrumental in voting you tenure . Head directly for the silvery-haired , old-school gentleman scholars whose pianos are littered with photographs of themselves with dear B.B. at I Tatti ; they still hold the fort , thank God , at most departments from Berkeley to Cornell . . . . Do n't omit enrapturing some of the useful faculty wives you might find most dreary , medievalists ' spouses bovine with domesticity , blue-jeaned guerilleres beginning to agitate for civil rights . Achieve repute for a good table , be noted for amusing little sauces , heed Oscar Wilde 's dictum that a gentleman is one who is never unintentionally rude . . . . " When staying in his Italian pensiones Edmund eats his dinner alone , a book at his elbow ; and then walks out slowly into the streets of Rome or Padua , stopping at a cafe to study closely some architecturallandmark and savor the prospect of the assistant professor/ship which will be his the following fall when he hands in his dissertation . Upon arriving in Florence he 'd checked into his pensione and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelicos . He arrived at half past twelve , the convent 's doors were closed , he remembered that some museums in Italy close at noon on Saturdays . He sat down on a park bench adjoining the convent , unaccustomed to suffering a flaw in his rigidly structured schedules , and tried to decide where to go next . In the Badia Church some blocks away Dante used to see Beatrice at Mass , in the Strozzi Palacenearby the medical student Savonarola had been brought to God after a severe disappointment in love . Church bells clanged , pigeons gathered in droves upon the statue of a nineteenth-century cardinal that faced Edmund 's bench . He observed the preening of males before indifferent , scurrying females , their iridescent green chests and bright rose beaks , the luminous pink eyes that blinked like signal lights in a laboratory . A few young men in blue jeans sat at the feet of two silver-haired duennas , chatting . Italians , their respect for the dignity of elders . . . he and Sophie and Claire would turn thirty the following year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very minute ; in a day or two he 'd try the pensiones she 'd be likely to have checked into ... . Wisps of cirrus clouds hovered over the city like angel 's lungs . An orange bus stopped and discharged a child in green licking on an ice-cream cone , two embracing tourists studying a guidebook . The pigeons flared upwards in a fusillade of feathers . Edmund rose and walked slowly towards the Bargello to revisit Donatello 's David , feeling sudden loneliness . Shopkeepers drawing down their blinds for the weekend , bare-legged Swedish tourists clanging with metal canteens and cameras , autumnal palette of ocher and mustard palacessimmering in a great August heat . He reached the Bargello through narrow side streets , avoiding the crowds on the main squares . An adoration of the early Sienese school hung in the main waiting room , angels ' faces modeled in apple green under the spread of rainbowed wings , mouths open in song or wonder . Hep135climbed the staircase slowly , hoping for the same burst of emotion he 'd received from the David eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at its open doorway , startled and joyful . In front of the Donatello , a few yards away from him , a young woman leaned against a pillar in a pose of some exhaustion , kerchiefed head held down . Her brooding air made it clear that she did n't see the streaks of sunlight on the gallery 's floor any more than she noticed its statuary , that she was engrossed in urgent deliberations of her own . She lowered her satchel to the floor , whipped off her kerchief with an exasperated gesture . Her cascade of copper curls confirmed Edmund 's suspicion and he walked swiftly towards her , stood behind Sophie and put his hands over her eyes . She spun around and fell into his arms , her body much frailer than he remembered . " Angel I just got the letter about your being in Italy , I was about to go to your pensione ! I 've looked for you everywhere , in Modena , Parma , Vicenza ! " " But those are n't the places with important Titians , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders at arms ' length to better study her face . " Four years ! " " Why did n't you also write me where I could find you , funny one ? " " I wanted to leave it to Providence . " A few new freckles speckled her marvelous nose . " Providence has been kind , let 's travel together a lot . They slept again in the same room for the followingthree weeks . Edmund renewed acquaintance with the arsenal of objects Sophie carried with her on all trips , he remembered them from their earliest adolescence . Postcards of Chartres , Spanish shawls , harlequin masks , she 'd always pack a few of these curios even for a weekend , as if she needed them to anchor her nomadic nature ; barely had she walked into a hotel or guest room  --  Nantucket , Haiti , Florence  --  she unpacked her magic identity kit , draped a mantilla over a lamp , rearranged furniture , cloaking the most banalp136room with her intense , domestic sensuality . On this particular journeyher first gesture was to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet how careful she was to remain passive , serene ! Edmund would usually kiss her good night with great tendernessafter they 'd read in bed for an hour . She fastidiously studied every subtle change in his body , his face . His cheeks were ruddier , his mane of hair made more golden by four years of California sun . He 'd grown even leaner and more muscled , tempered his body more fastidiously than ever , his moodiness had neither increased or decreased . Sitting in squares in front of their favorite churches  --  Santa Felicita , Ognissanti  --  they talked effusivelyabout their current problems , mostly his . Ah what a life Titian had , it was paradise on earth ! Such an artist did n't lick boots in the salon of some whimsical patron , he was often a grand seigneurhimself ; Charles V made Titian a Count of the Lateran Palace , gave him a knighthood , what have you , rulers from all over Europe paying visits to his studio . . . he was n't yet quite sure how much biography to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperorhimself leaning down to pick up one of the master 's paintbrushes . . . . The motto on T 's coat of arms bore the words " Art is more powerful than nature , " the Romantic nonsense about artists ' suffering was still a long way off , such an artist dealt in lumber and grain , invested in real estate , gold , jewelry . . . . There 's a marvelousdescription of the freedom with which he worked when he reached his seventies , he used brushes as big as broomsticks and his fingers , even the palms of his hands ; Vasari observed that he painted " like God when he created man . " . .. He could do whatever he wanted , Soph , they left him alone , they let him work into the fervor and loneliness of great age . . . .

Twice they went to Arezzo . Edmund could n't remember the location of the church where Piero had painted his frescoes on the Miracle of the Cross ; it was one of his more petulant days ; Sophie kept pointing in the direction of the main square but he complained that she could not read maps , refused to ask directions . They arrived ten minutes before the sacristan was scheduled to close the doors ; once in the church he refused to answer Sophie 's questions about the iconography of Saint Constantine 's dream . " Just look and enjoy them , do n't try to explain everything out of existence . " He complained that he 'd remembered the frescoes betterlighted , more grandiose , she understood how intensely he cultivatedhis moments of high emotion for art , that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked Sophie 's hair and apologized , gave her the little lecture she 'd craved . " That dream of Constantine you were asking about . . . the Tuscans excelled at depicting hallucinations , phantasms , dreams from the beyond . . . the FranciscanRevival , its gospel of unearthly joy was their chief source of inspiration . . . . That afternoon they sat in a cafe while Edmund sketched the fronton of the cathedral . He 'd planned to do nothing but finish his thesis during this trip ; he 'd only started drawing as a way of protectinghimself from Sophie 's solicitude , aware of that nutritional respect she had towards the act of art . He drew no persons , no landscapes , only architectural details from facades of buildings , friezes and roundels , fluted pilasters and stone rosettes . She checked on his materials , pacing and talking to him while he worked , observing that he drew as meticulously as ever , with the same number three pencil on Arches paper .

" Another day while Edmund drew , Sophie read him a note that she 'd just received from Jeff : " I 'm writing to announce glad tidings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We did want you and Plinker and Eddem to know as soon as all was totally safe . I 've got her under wraps , she 's seven months along and feeling nifty .

She scrutinized his face , terrified at the prospect that it would show pain , equally perplexed to find it impassive , inscrutable . " Anglican romanticization of nature as vulgar as it 's misguided , " he muttered , " stinking with baa-baa sheep and bunny rabbits playingcroquet on the lawn . " Lying awake in the dark one night during their stay in Florence she compared herself to a hunter waiting before dawn for the most desired brilliant mallard to rise out of the darkling water , then rebelled at the image 's violence and the metaphor was wrong anyhow ; she had long auscultated her patience , was ready to wait for him for many more years  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifism in her search for great love ; her motto was watch everything , mend when you can , lie still when you 're helpless  --  duringthat stay in Florence she 'd pretended to be utterly content with her present lot , her rising career , her new selfreliance  --  shelavishly praised Edmund for all this ; only he could have emancipated her from dutiful filial acceptance of her parents ' fame-starved lives  --  she never shared with Edmund the agonizing weeks she 'd spent after his departure to California , her decision to only work night shifts for a few years to make a radical break withp139all that was most familiar and dearest to her in the city  --  neither did she share the letters she 'd received from Claire a few weeks previously ; throughout her pregnancy Claire had had great depressions , seemed unable to leave her house , had barely opened the door to go outside . . . .

Soph dearest , do write me often and I 'll write back faithfully ; I who 've always been so aloof and self-sufficient , I need you more than ever and probably more fiercelythan you 've ever needed me . . . . " As Edmund fell into his deep easy sleeps he was aware that Sophie might lie awake in one of her frequent bouts of insomnia , humid and superb , still waiting for her once-and-only artist . He kept remembering those last nights in New York a few weeks after the Nantucket wedding during which he 'd meticulously prepared suicide at the side of this woman for whom he had immeasurable love and esteem . In between his extravagant orgies of sleep he had outlined diverse plans for self-destruction in order to escape his growing anguish , replace the death by smothering which her solicitudethreatened him with . Pills are too messy he 'd mutter , drowningtakes too much courage , pistols are better , ah , that neat tiny bullet hole in the last minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . What will become of her ? he often wondered in the summer of 1959 as he watched Sophie pacing up and down a piazza while he drew ; what would be the fate of this best friend for whom he had such an ambivalence of love and terror ? She 'd redirected her indefatigable tenderness , thank God , towards the problems of the world . She paced about the streets while he worked , conversing with passersby or reading newspapers with the aid of an Italian dictionary , returning with disparate shreds of information : Italians feared a vacuum in Lebanon , ten thousand Algerian refugees migrated to Tuscany in the past two years , largestatomic plant in Europe about to uproot the sheep-farming economyof the Modena region . You 've improved Sofka he muttered to himself as he drew , you 're on the right road all right , you 're morep140terrific than ever , but he never told her in so many words .

On their second to last night together he lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was staring at him across space as she had so often in New York , with the piercing eyes of an animal making its way through the darkness . He tightened the sheets around his shoulders and told her he could n't marry her yet . Oh I know , I know , she whispered , almost laughingly . And how does my Sofia Larionovna always know , what makes my girl so smart ? I 've learned that 's the way much human desire works Eddem , people are always pursuing some great white whale , that which they can never have , the way you 're still wanting Claire , the way I 've wanted you ... oh do n't pretend that 's all passe Edmund , I know just what Peb means to both of us , she 's what Captain Ahab was hunting for , solitude , self-containment , perfection . . . that 's why I 've chased her too , we all want the unreachable ; Claire 's my closest friend but I doubt if she can ever belong to anyone or anything except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh do n't worry about me in the least Eddem and do n't be disillusioned , you have n't hurt me a bit during this particular segment of our life together . . .

I have so little of your goodness , your greatness of heart , when will you realize how stingy I am about showing my love ? . . .

" He sat down on the edge of her bed , ruffling her hair . She still smelled of musk , of essence of roses . She brushed her hand over hisp142chest , unbuttoning the shirt he had just put on . He leaned down to kiss her , thinking this is a mystery I 'll never understand . He knew again the ecstasy of her mouth enfolding his sex , of her tongue lappingat him like a suckling at the breast . She knew he had loved her absolutely , if only for an hour , which may be the longest it ever matters . The next day , having several hours to spare betweenplanes on his way back to Great Britain and the United States , Edmund stopped in Rome 's Villa Borghese to take a few last notes on Titian 's Sacred and Profane Love .

Scores of acolytesline up at the door of his office at dawn of registration day to be ensured enrollment in his classes . They delight in his mellifluous delivery and his meticulous concern for each student 's progress .

There lives in Berkeley in the early 196os a tall , blond , suntanned professor who fascinates Edmund because of the sheer abundance of his happiness . Luke Edwards earned tenure at the age of thirtythree , has won every sailing regatta or tennis tournament in sight , is considered to be the West Coast 's most eloquent lecturer on WilliamJames , has earned literary success by publishing delicately autobiographicalshort stories which center upon the unexpected felicitiesof his domestic bliss . As if this copiousness was n't sufficient ! Luke Edwards also claims to have found God . An ordained minister of the Methodist Church , he obligingly holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university chaplain to engage in his own regatta races . Edmund 's friendship with the Reverend Luke Edwards enables him to draw the following conclusion : His own happiness in California is not one whit smaller than that of this creature graced with every attribute of human bliss . " I 've bought a modest little cottage overlooking the water , " Edmundtells his colleagues , " with dreadfully mixed feelings about becoming a bourgeois landowner . . . . " The phrase charms personsof all persuasions , but at heart he feels no ambivalence whatsoever . His dinner parties ( seductive candlelight , Russian delicacies remembered from Mara 's days ) are esteemed as the most delectable in town . He forces tulip bulbs , studies antique catalogs , has become a promising collector : Etruscan vase and XVIIIth Dynasty Egyptian bronze bought for a song from an unseasoned West Coast dealer , Tarascan statuettes bartered for a few dollars in Merida .

" When Edmund returns to his sunny cottage the cat Vico pounces softly onto his master 's shoulder , rubbing his stubbly whiskers against his neck in way of greeting . He climbs upon Edmund'slap as he sits at his desk correcting papers and gently digs his claws into his master 's lap to reassert his presence . Edmund often stares at the animal as it lies coiled in satisfaction on his windowsill , roaring its pleasure at the sun , and compares its furled contentmentto his own .

There also lives in Berkeley in the 196os a large , garrulous professor of Russian literature who rubs himself against all things Slavic like a chilled animal seeking the fire 's heat , and has no other passion in life save for women . John Mirsky is immense and bearded , lives in a state of constant crisis , prefers to engage in all activities in the supine position , and like the characters of the novels he lectures about seems to be forever suffering from some final agony of belligerence and passion . Visiting him one steers between mounds of Lermontov , Pushkin , Tyutchev volumes that threaten to avalanche the visitor like the crumbling walls of a ravine ; one finds John lying on his dusty couch moaning his adulation for a newfound love or a newly discovered poem . He lavishes his most passionate monographs on the critical moments of the briefest and most disastrous destinies  --  the last poem written before Lermontov'sfatal duel , the last letters written by Esenin before his suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonizes each time over the betrayal of his revolutionary forefathers ' dreams , swears never to return but reapplies for a visa eighteen months later , revisitsMoscow to wallow in the agony of still another disillusionment . His women can be frail , pimply freshmen or voluptuous divorcee flutists , he seduces them into his book-crammed lair for a few months , lets himself be battered by the pains of their infidelities or by the nascent bliss of one of his . And after a tempestuous dissolutionreburies himself in his dusty rooms to write a new monograph on Gogol , Gorki , Gumilev . Upon peaks of emotion his large sat/urnine face erupts in patches of violet like the mauled cheeks of a boxer ; turbulent passions or demanding translations manifest themselves like stigmata on his body , making him look as if he 'd spent the night street-fighting in the streets of Yerevan . His immense , bearded form looms over all as he walks through campus , and by the triumphant or dejected cast of his head Edmund can always tell whether Professor Mirsky is living the end of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dejection of a womanless week . This is the way Edmund had met him : standing alone in a narrow abandoned stack of the Berkeley library bellowing out for his own solitary delectation some lines of Mayakovski 's : " The sea is ebbing . . . The incident is closed . . . Love 's boat has been shatteredagainst the life of everyday . In his lonely womanless moments John lavishes on Edmund his intense affection , bringing him rare Georgian vodka , exotic brands of tea he 'd bought a decade ago in Kiev . After recounting the denouement of his last passion he lies supine on Edmund 's couch , continuing to roar out more beloved lines : " Ah for that woman who brings us delectation/After having fully tortured us for decades ... ' " There are many discussions of love , death , the redemptivepower of suffering and passion .

" " When will you wean yourself from the tyranny of romantic love that 's strangled us for two hundred years , all a lot of Wertherian nonsense , dear boy ! " " But there it is , big as the Winter Palace twice a day , " John bellows . The cat jumps off the windowsill , rubs against Edmund 's ankle , walks towards the kitchen to signify his sense of approaching dinnertime.  | " Most lust is a creation of our imagination , a form of literature !

" Ah if you could only meet that exquisite creature whose betrayalcured me of all lust , Ivan Maximovich . . . I drink to her who has purged me of all future passion ! " " And I drink to the resurrection of every venereal drive in your body , Gedmund Petrovich ! " " To the defeat of the demon of desire ! " " No no , you desiccated monk , to the eternal Venus ! " John drinks . " Ah yes , to the embrace of chaste celestial sacred Venus ! " " You will see , Abelard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened this way : On the first day of semester a tall , frail creature with an abundant mass of golden hair made a tempestuous and belated entrance into Edmund 's class in nineteenth-centuryFrench painting . Standing close to her a few weeks later in her apartment , where she 'd asked him for a drink to advise her on Impressionists inherited from her husband 's family , he saw her eyes as an unnaturally pale green , the hue of new moss at spring thaw . Within their first hour together Simona made it clear that her husband was in California much less than half the year , and was insatiably engaged in developing new terrain  --  carving up the Sardiniancoast with descendants of the Aga Khan , buying hunting lodges in Kenya , Ceylon . She spilled her life to Edmund with much tossing of her splendid hair , seeming to have already documentedp148herself thoroughly on his , often drawing similarities between their two fates . Ah she had been plagued by much misfortune ! Her mother ( Hungarian , an angel ) died when she was eight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her in the care of erratic aunts , who in turn had her brought up in a series of provincial convents . Dio the horror of it , the beatings , the near-starvation diet of sweet potatoes and sour grass tea ! Her first lover  --  the wretch  --  at least served the purpose of financing her acting lessons , which she was sure would have been her true , brilliant vocation if destiny had been less atrocious . But at Papa 's command she was married for mercenary reasons at age eighteen to a little count who measured his descent from the ninth century . She had left him the following year  --  he was the greatest bore in Europe  --  and spent two years in Paris writing poetry at the keep of an art historian who was finishinga book on Byzantine mosaics . She adored art historians , she could never stress enough how she believes in Edmund 's genius . . . . Later there had been a specialist in eighteenth-century tomb sculpture . . . anyhow , last year she married the half-Italian scion to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her comfortably to herself with a few servants when he goes parachutingin the Himalayas or dives for coral in the most barracudainfestedreefs of the Caribbean and has already discarded two earlierwives who desired bourgeois marriages . .. . At least that is the way she tells it . Weeks and months later , as Edmund cups in his hands the frail face dominated by shrewd jadehuedeyes he thinks he knows what binds him to her . I am finally staring at a face which holds some shreds of my own childhood : in this sun-drenched haven which only glimpses the century 's pain through some crazy course in the history of film she offers me some continuity with my own past , some shared pool of history and suffering . . . but the green eyes do not stare back with the same recognition . Simona is seared , unaffectable , living solely for a tenuoussurvival which she 's decided to ornate with as much novelty as possible , white Jaguars , numerous travels , rare drugs and wines .

Pale long-limbed body , flesh boyish or prepubescentp149in its frailty , mane of flaming hair spread on a velvet pillow in the light of the dying embers  --  new items in Edmund 's collection of the exquisite . Their meetings are neutral and torrid , unswept by any emotions except her whims for new sensations and his desire to break her will . . . . " Nou ? " John asks . " Orgasm is another business of the brain , dear one , a way of gainingmore information about ourselves . . . . But , oh , how she exploitsthe frailty of my ego . . . . " " I know , I know ! This creature as obdurate as granite is begging you to sculpt her destiny , correct ? " Will Edmund please help Simona to find her true essence ? she begs him ; she 's always had to live in a loathsome state of dependence on men , it will never cease until she finds that preciousvocation she 's been struggling to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress , an artist , an art historian ? This Sophie he often talks to her about , who helps support her old sick parents so nobly and has just won a big prize for her writing , how did she go about finding herself as a paparazza ? Perhaps that could be a career for Simona , should she try that next ? Only Edmund can help her look for the real Simona Danielli , a daughter of the depraved Roman aristocracy who might only have a few more years to live . . . she expresses these quests in a mongrel mix of languages through the persistent haze of Turkish cigarettes , her eyes glowing with intensity , in whatever moments she is not attempting to enlarge her still fitful grasp of the nineteenth century . As Edmund satisfies himself on Simona 's insatiable body he only begins to feel her in his power when the balance of pain and pleasure she demands verges on danger , when he takes her with as much brutality as his body can musterafter inhaling rarities that make his heart beat at double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps ten hours a night , meticulously supervises dissertations on " Cycles of Martyrdomof Saint Agatha in Italian Painting , " " The Iconography of the Railroad in Nineteenth-Century French Art .

( " Richter'strimmed his hair ! " young women professors in the audience whisper adoringly . " I liked it better when it was more Byronic . . . . " ) Some months after they had started torturing each other Edmund and Simona went to spend a weekend at a seaside hotel in Big Sur which Simona wished to visit because she might eventually interviewHenry Miller there ; she could begin her career as a paparazza that way . . . . Edmund had looked on this stay as an occasion to dissuade her from flying to Katmandu where she planned to join her husband on a two-month hunting trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before experienced he seized her many times a day , upon waking , in a quiet sea-lapped cove , before their dinner outings , testing his power over her by trying to make her promise that she would spend the summer in Berkeley rather than accompany Craven to still another nature-depleting trip to an underdeveloped country . But Simona insisted on everything , Machu Picchu and frequentstays at the Gritti and the Plaza-Athenee , she desired her master 's degree and her Edmund and her tenuous ability to talk volubly about Courbet ; why should she relinquish any of these freedomsfor the sake of one brilliant member of a sex she detests , Sono tutti stronzi ! She seemed to skirt the edge of emotion on the last day of their stay at Big Sur , her limbs twined about him like tendrils of fire about a log , she swore her eternal dedication to his body ... but the next morning she insisted on returning to San Francisco , where she must pack for that trip to Katmandu . They returned to Berkeley the day before Sophie was scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hawaii , where she 'd spent the past year writing a series of articles on the fiftieth state . " Statehood is outrageous ! " ( her last letter ) . " Do you realize that these blessed islands are blossoming into one of the most powerfuloutposts of the military-industrial complex . . . American imperialism cloaked by a seductive veil of sunshine and flowers . . . creating one of the most monstrous racist pentagons on earth ? ... "  | " How nice to be able to catch a glimpse of you , " Edmund had answered the previous week as he despaired over Simona 's threateneddeparture . " It 's far from the ideal time for me but I 'll meet that 10:50 Pan Am flight from Hawaii on May 12th .... " There are few moments more brutal than those in which a fantasy we have evolved over months , in moments of great solitude , dissolves upon the instant of encounter . Sophie had envisionedEdmund standing alone at the gate of her flight , guarded but smiling , embracing her with that heat of gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tall lanky woman at Edmund 's side had a mane of gold hair that recalled the abandoned creatures of Pre-Raphaelite paintings , was dressed in thin floating vestments that gave her a surface of glimmering plumage . Her long pale hands shook slightly , she smiled perpetually , seemed determined to immediately charm the visitor . Edmund chain-smoked and never took off his dark glasses , reminding Sophie of those times in their adolescence when he wished to seem most inscrutable and mature . Sophie decided to remain equally inscrutable . Simona 's interest in her seemed to make Edmund uncomfortable . He soon became garrulous . " The ocean is quite beautiful , " Sophie said as they sat down to lunch in Sausalito . " The sight of unenclosed water is barely tolerable . " " Ah ottimo , ottimo ! " Simona exclaimed . " I adore the Edmund who hates nature , it is divinely comic ! " " What do you do for a living , Simona ? " Sophie asked . " You never , never ask that in Europe , " Edmund snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Let her be , let her be ! She 's a little sincere but sweet , so sweet ! " " I 'll tell you what she does for a living , Soph , she collects art historians ' cocks , the way Catherine the Great used to collect very tall generals .

There 's no reason not to go to Bucharest , the Brancusis are magnificent . . . . " As they gave her a brief tour of Berkeley , Sophie kept asking questions which seemed to bore Edmund and Simona extremely , how many Chicanos had entered California since 1960 she wanted to know , what was the average yearly income of the Chinese working in San Francisco , were n't students at Berkeley beginning to activate for students ' rights ? " . . . and you have so many independent beliefs ; it is wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in Europe , particularly if you hate men as much as I do ; presently I am nothing but another bibelot in the life of a man who goes about ruining nature in as many parts of the world as possible ; he insists I accompanyhim on his shooting trips and it is amusing and helps me get rid of my anger . . . . You 're beautifully self-composed , Sofia , and you esteem yourself to be very strong , yes ? " " I 'm getting there , " Sophie said . Simona flew early that evening to Katmandu . Edmundwas co-hosting a party at the Faculty Club that night for a colleague who was leaving for Harvard . When he came to pick up Sophie at her hotel at 9:0o P.M. he seemed to be still another person from the guarded fragile Edmund she 'd lived with in Florence , the moody irate one she 'd shared earlier that day with the Italian . There was a forced radiance about him . " We 'll be an hour or so late to the party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's approximately when I like to arrive to these academicdos . . . . You seem to be in absolutely terrific shape , Sophie darling ! " " And except for the terrific new beard you 're a perfect mess , I think . " " What are you talking about ? I 'm in stupendous form !

" By this time she was steeled to her life 's search , as he smiled and tugged at a forelock of her hair she knew that he was hiding his surprise at her new measure of impudence . As she walked into the crowded room with Edmundhe immediately became its center of attention , his head stood magisterially above the level of the crowd . He stood radiant and seemingly immense at the door , lingering there as if he wanted to prolong the impact of his entrance ; the crowd seemed to turn towards him like many delicate metal filings realigning themselves around a magnet , the sweet domestic classicists ' wives with braided hair coiled chastely about their heads , the tall tanned archaeologists with yachting pins in their lapels , the tall sunned English professors who 'd forgotten to take elasticized tennis bands off their wrists , they all turned towards Edmund .

He was making the rounds of the room , introducing her as his oldest childhood friend , " the closest thing I have to a sister , " " the apple of my eye , " " star reporter for the New York Post , " " my very own house radical , " he said another time . He hugged colleagues , kissed their women on both cheeks European fashion , made appointments for the forthcoming week , tennis matches , boating excursions . Time came to make a toast for thep154departing colleague , it was Edmund , always Edmund , who was asked to make the first toast . " This is not to say that it is impossible for Jonathan to simultaneously retain the deep affection of the Berkeley and Harvard community . . . it is rather to say that Jonathanhas a greater capacity to preserve the affection of those two great institutions than any other Rembrandt scholar I can think of . . . I drink to those disciplined savants , to those noble alcoholicsof the single object of Jonathan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing barbarism of our times . . . . " Edmund does everything with such style , no one can afford to give a birthday party without him in Berkeley because his toasts are so unique , has Sophie seen his little collection of preColumbian ? Each piece acquired for a song , what an eye ! Sophie had to talk for a while to a voluminous hirsute Slavic scholar introducedas John Mirsky . " Grandiose man this Richter , " he roared out to her , " the mainstay of my existence , ca n't you resurrect him , resurrect ? . . . " At one point Sophie saw Edmund hovering alone at the bar , hands clutching the rail as if suddenly seized with some great anxiety he could n't share ; he was bent over the bar going " aah , aah , " a strange sibilant drawing of his breath ; this lasted for a few seconds and then he went to the mirror , ran his fingers quickly through his hair before returning to the crowd his brilliant smile . As they came into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie 's shoulder , its intense and immediate recognition of her ( " eight years , Vico , " she whispered , " eight years ! " ) , gave her a moment of pain . Edmund opened a split of champagne . She lay on a corner of his bed , staring at the exquisite little clay statues on his mantelpiece , blank lunar faces , archetypal arms folded over pure narrow chests . He sat at her feet with his head in hei lap , saying the Tarascan one at the right is probably a votive figure , some deity invoked at the time of human sacrifice . . . and then he turned up towards her and before either of them had undressed pulled up her skirt and buried his head in the thick hair of her sex , spread its lips apart with his subtle tongue , a tongue like a muscular flower petal that had a power , a languorous rhythm she had never known about ; you are my Orient , this he often said , you 're my favorite of all human substances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later hisp155tongue and his sex explored every orifice of her body , the night seemed dissected by their flailing limbs , she had the image of insects gone crazed on some drug , mandibles whirling in all directions , mouths screaming for new angles , new chasms , we drone in ecstasy as we straddle the same road or lie furled , receiving bliss from distant hands , the other watches , columnar and vigilant , enjoying the joy he 's offering , lying still in the expectation of his own pleasure , our limbs rotate like the arms of a compass , any dawn becomes awesome with the monotony of more desire . There was a new skill and delectation in his lovemaking which saddened her profoundly . The next morning as he drove her to the airport they were affectionate , matter-of-fact with each other ; this also was their manner , to act like two siblings who must discuss some family affairs before leaving each other for a stretch of time .

" She reached into his pocket and lit a cigarette ; she had n't smoked one for years . " I wish to be superbly taken care of . If you knew how depressing it 's been to spend three years as a roving reporter living in sleazy motel rooms , trying to fall asleep to the screech of Greyhound buses and the whining of icemaking machines . . . and then the loneliness of the evenings , solitary meals month after month in motel restaurants watching teenage organists with foot-high mops of bleached hair play the Dance of the Hours ' on electric organs , feelingtoo bushed after a twelve-hour day to walk more than twenty yards from my bedroom at night .. ..

" Why do n't you stay over an extra few days and talk it out with me , Soph ? Let 's go back to town this instant . " " Your kindness smacks of duty . I do think you 've got enough to deal with as it is . " " Please , Soph , please stay . " " We 've got to do some of these figurings out alone . . . . It 's just that it 's not a life for a woman , Edmund . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started to laugh , knowing it would forestall tears . " I do n't want to be extraordinary yet . . . . All I want is . . . what 's that word the Italian uses so well ? Repose !

" Her flight was being called . " Let me go , " she said . And then , as she kissed him good-bye : " I saw the most marvelous graffiti on a wall in Berkeley yesterday .

The pathways of the silent muddy town are sodden with recent rain , the church bells of delicately gilded Novgorod seem to have stopped in midcadence ; Claire says it 's as if some carefully timed poison had steeped into the veins of an entire population and just this morning put it to sleep .

On what boat was the shot that was heard around the world ? " " Aurora ! " " Good children , chocolatefor all ....

" Irina wears a T-shirt with the words Disco Beat on her left breast , shiny high-heeled black shoes which she keeps wiping with her tissue , a long hunter green skirt with matching jockey cap set on her carefullycrimped hair . Claire has said she ca n't detect a single chink in her armor . Edmund has talked about the narcissism of the new Soviet woman . Irina twists and turns her head seductively at her Americans , pouting and smiling , fingering her curls . " Another point ! Our per capita income has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has risen by twenty percent ... " " . . . and only ten percent of Soviet women report ever having had an orgasm , " Sophie says languidly . There 's no telling what Irina ever chooses to hear . She continues handing out cucumbers , buttering slices of black bread .

Irina steps slowly , delicately on the cobblestones of Novgorod , often bending down to wipe her shoes . She moves in thep161frail sepulchral rain as on a field of broken glass , walking with delicatecrablike motions to avoid the troughs of mud .

Claire , Sofka , come stand in front with me here  --  even more than in the West the Slavic Church serves as an icon , an image which shares in the divinity of the archetype it represents  --  and in this country the Church has always been seen as a redeeming community of love in which the individual is relatively unimportantand helpless  --  Irina Grigorievna do n't fret dear , we 'll get our tea , we 'll get it in a minute ( Ai you 're freezing me Gedmund Petrovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian nation has always seen itself as a mystical organism outside of which there is no salvation , Edmund continues ; its ancient communitarian roots give us many clues to what 's happening here today  --  the Slays neverrecognized Greco-Roman concepts of private property , the generosity , the hospitality you still shower us with today , dear Irina , manifests that unique sense of brotherhood  --  there was never any room in Russian society for our Western notions of individualism and individual salvationAll utterly brilliant Gedmund Petrovich but let 's . . .

Do n't talk to her like that , Claire shouts at him , leave her alone ! Ever since childhood Sophie and he had criticized each other with brutal clarity but Claire had abstained from any criticism of Sophie , as if she were a sacred precinct of her life which must remain untouched , and now they were both shouting together at him .

You ca n't go in , you ca n't go in the old woman sings , sweeping banks of dust back towards the steps of the church , you see no one will ever go in . They walked back to the station a half hour before train time and went to the buffet for tea . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. on . A Verdi aria played on the radio , floating from the little room like a summer breeze . A large blond waitress stood behind the counter , her hair teased and lacquered like an operatic diva 's , her lips painted a dark shade of ruby red . Shep164leaned against a vitrine which displayed arrays of radishes and beets , coarse red caviar and smoked fish . The music blared , photographs of Soviet ski teams hung on the walls , the little room was bathed in a seductive roseate light . We 'd like some tea , Irina said . We 're closed ! the waitress called out . Then why are you here ? Irina asked . I 'm telling you there 's nothing ! the waitress shouted , nothing to eat , nothing to drink ! Then why do you stand there all dolled up with all the lights and music on and that fake food on your counter ? None of your business , there 's nothing left , nothing whatsoever ! The Verdi blared , the caviar gleamed under the rosy lights . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know precisely why there 's nothing ! Remont , the woman shouted back , remont , we 're in repair ! And why are you forever repairing ? Irina cried out , since my childhood I 've never heard about anything but remont , the Hermitageis in remont ! My grandmother 's heating system has been three months in remont ! The waitress seized one of her plates with a threatening gesture . Irina swiftly ushered her Americans out of the door and led them towards the train , her needled heels clicking angrily on the stone embankment . Ai what a situation , what a state we 're in Gedmund Petrovich. . . when we can know when our buffets are open then we 'll have true Communism . Once settled on the train she was quiet , and after straightening her hair in the mirror she bit her lip and looked contritely at the landscape . It 's so wonderful to travel in a country that 's even more fucked up than ours Sophie said .

He dreamt that Irina was walking slowly through the monastery town in her green jockey outfit , her heels clicking like castanets on the pavements of the silent city . She pointed her long painted fingers to north , west , all around , and at each languid wave of her arms golden domes melted into haze , fortifications crumbled , steeples toppled , with the swing of her slim hips church bells were silenced , gold crosses vanished from sight , entire kremlins evaporated into the roseate void of the Soviet evening , the town turned as still as a firmament , as inhuman as the stars . . . after several languorous waves of her lacquered nails all became solitude and emptiness again , all returned to the silence of the eternal plain , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " THE most puzzling transformation has taken place in our Sophie , " Claire writes Edmund early in 1964 . " Imagine this : She seems to have entered a brand-new stage of rebellion against the notion of frequenting persons of any talent . . . gone are the promising painters and budding dramatists , the men courtingher this year are all hopelessly conservative and very wealthy and dotty about her ; does she crave shelter after all these years of pennilessness and solitude ? One can not help but be very moved and a little perplexed . . . . " A few months later Claire sent Edmund the following newspaper clipping : Dorothy Kilgallen reports that Sophie Ross , prizewinningNew York Post reporter and daughter of former talentmagnate Larry Ross , sprung a surprise on her friends yesterday and tied the knot with canned food tycoon Bernard B. Reilly ... " Beebee " Reilly is rumored to have bought a 3o-acre estate in Southampton just last week . .. . " Mr. and Mrs. B. B.

" " . .. to a soiree in honorof the Uruguayan ambassador to the United Nations . . . " Uruguay ? Why Uruguay ? Edmund ponders all afternoon as he corrects papers from his Brueghel seminar . It dawns on him the next day that Uruguay is noted for its large importation of some carplike fish , which it is Mr. Reilly 's vocation to place in cans . In the chaste months following Simona 's final departure , no correspondence more perplexes Edmund than the invitations to Sophie Reilly 's numerousparties in Long Island and New York , engraved in florid script on Tiffany 's heaviest stock . Edmund even begins to read the women 's page of The New York Times , in which the Reillys ' prodigalityis frequently scrutinized . Beebee buys a town house in one of the most exclusive blocks of Manhattan 's East Seventies , commissionsSophie 's portrait from Larry Rivers and Andy Warhol , pays unprecedented prices for a Sheraton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of the Reillys ' prodigal travels . They fly to Glasgow for a weekend to premiere an opera ; to Peru to pick up several bolts of custom-made textiles for their living room ; to London to bid on a case lot of 1937 Mouton-Rothschild , leaving on the Queen Elizabeth three days later to ensure their vintage minimumdisturbance . Claire seems so enthralled with her Sane chapterand her civil-rights marches , and Jeff with his teaching and his sports , that the Howells do n't get a firsthand view of the Reillys until the fall , when a note from Jeff capsules his impressions of the new menage : " It 's like some African principality ... outlandish dark servants standing at every door just to open it for you , champagneflowing throughout the day , and our old friend wandering about in her finery , not quite as sylphlike as in the last few years , warbling , Beebee has the caviar arrived , where are those chandeliers ? .. " In April of 1964 one of Edmund 's seminars in Impressionismhad already been canceled because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd lost a class in medieval Flemish to another group protesting the ban on travel to Cuba . The pickets and rallies that proliferate the following fall centerabout the issue of students ' rights . John gets arrested with hisp168students on the very first sit-in . Reverend Edwards is speaking in every corner of the campus about restoring credibility to the community . Throughout the autumn 's demonstrations Edmund spends an increasing amount of evenings at home , reluctant to engage in student-faculty discussions in which he 's bound to be branded as ultrareactionary . In his free hours he begins to write a series of articles attacking the new vogue for Pop Art and rehearses delicate dishes for himself and his cat  --  sorrel soup , kidneys flambeed in Armagnac  --  wondering when he can ever again impress his colleagueswith them . Claire 's letters only mirror the mayhem growing in his former paradise . " I 'm cheered by the prospect of joining the San Francisco-Moscow Peace Marchers when they pass through Boston next month ; I 'll walk with them for several weeks before going South to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl to take care of Victoria while I 'm away ; Jeff is beside himself of course : What will the family think Peb ? ' He 's being kept quite busy thank heavens by a local field hockey association which calls itself Marvelous Mothers and Fabulous Fathers .... " In November the Free Speech Movement is formed , several thousand Berkeley students immobilize a police car for thirty-two hours in protest against the arrest of one of their peers . " Our campusswarms with all the accouterments of twentieth-century horror , " Edmund writes in the first of his letters to the campus paper , The Daily Californian . " We live in a melee of gas masks , clubs , guns , walkie-talkies , motorcycle jackboots , pickets , banners , bullhorns , armed astronauts adorned in garish motel bathroom colors . . . crowds scream and bodies interlock as the world 's most privileged children protest their oppression . . . meanwhile a fashionable new breed of youth-adoring professors weep at their students ' plight in the midst of liturgical parades that equal the pomp of Seville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go South and join Martin Luther King 's magnificent movement for human equality !

Joan Baez entertains the crowds byp169singing " We Shall Overcome , " bids them to face their struggle with love in their hearts and leaves shortly after midnight . At 3:05 A.M. the governor of California broadcasts a message giving the police the order to arrest . John goes to jail again . Mario Savio bites a policeman on the thigh while being dragged away . " Beleaguered teachers ! " Edmund writes The Daily Californian . " Have we forgotten what our authority represents ?

The possessed youth gesticulating and shouting in the begonia-decked lawns outside his window , those once docile angels who 'd taken the place of the childrenhe 'd yearned to have , are betraying him . . . as he finishes his letter a student runs through the building with a bullhorn announcingthat thousands are rallying that afternoon at Sproul Hall to condemnGovernor Pat Brown , the regents , the president , the chancellor , the police , the United States government . Edmund packs his book bag and drives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cat and for himself , returns to his flowered cottage in the Berkeleyhills , padlocks his doors for the weekend to protect himself from the possible intrusion of ruffians handing out more petitions . He opens a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon , puts on his recording of Monteverdi 's Vespers for the Year 1609 , places his latest acquisition in sight of his desk  --  a fine little sang-de-boeuf vase , Ming Dynasty . And he sits down at the typewriter to compose his attack on the new art , Vico purring , purring at the edge of the sunny window . " The phenomenon of Pop Art presents us with still anotherp170tightrope act in the circus of public taste .. . .

" The din of voices reaches Edmund every few minutes like waves of nausea from the protesters ' rallying point twelve blocks away . Edmund plugs up his ears with wax and continues writing . With a passion that surprises him , he goes on to defend the Abstract Expressionistpainting he 'd attacked so vigorously ten years ago . The president of the university , the radio announces , has canceledall classes and called the entire community to meet at Berkeley'sGreek amphitheater ... . " Unlike the debased kitsch of current Pop , Abstract Expressionismhad embodied most of the values of traditional humanist art : dynamic form , lyric power , a distilled celebration of the glory of the created world . . . .

After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edmund drives to a village on the calm side of the Sierra to avoid setting foot in downtown Berkeley . He mails his article , renews his supply of victuals and sits down at the typewriter again to write another letter to The Daily Californian . " There are no more efficient prophets of totalitarianism than the virtuosos of cheap guilt presently holding toy guns to our heads and forcing us to politicize institutions whose very essence is to stand above politics . . . . " By biting a policeman on the thigh Mario Savio ( **29;8377;TOOLONG of our Student Soviet ) has earned himself the dazzling new label of charismatic leader , ' thus debasing a hallowed Greek word to a label for moral parvenus . . . . " As for the Songstress of the Dispossessed arriving at Sproul Hall in her gleaming Jaguar , it assures us that Berkeley has become nothing but a massive entertainment to the world . .. " A partial quiescence returns the following spring . Edmund is enthralled by the teaching of his new course , " Stoicism in Seventeenth-Century Painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of controversial attention he 's beginning to enjoy  --  ravesfrom the older generation of gentlemen scholars , vociferousattacks from younger dealers and critics . Every morning over breakfast Edmund proceeds to the women 's page of The New York Times after glancing at its art critique and book review . He reads with interest that Beebee Reilly has bought a quantity of Sevres at auction and has built New York City 's largest private wine cellar in the bowels of his town house ; that Sophie has developed what The New York Times describes as " one of the city 's most curious salons . " ( Sophie photographed during an interview , standing by a Ming vase of the feeblest period , something newly round about her face : " Being a hostess is an exciting , demanding , full-time vocation . . . . I 've never had a sense of roots until now ; do n't you think modern society is intensely rootless ? . . . Actually I know almost no one in New York , I never know any of the guests at our parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own house .... " ) In May , Edmund was invited to give a paper at an art historians ' conference being held in Philadelphia the following month . He accepted with pleasure , and that very day booked a plane reservation for his first trip to New York in several years . He would satisfy his curiosity about the Reilly menage , attend his conventionand later drop in on Claire and Jeff in Nantucket . As Providencewould have it , still another invitation reached him in Berkeleya few weeks before he left : " At Home to Celebrate a Birthday : Mr. and Mrs. B. B. Reilly , 125 East 77th Street , June 25th , from sixp172The walls were of oak paneling . He stepped upon Bokhara rugs . A black man in white turban opened the door when Edmund arrived at the Reillys shortly after six and ushered him into an immense dining room on the ground floor . It immediately struck Edmund that Sophie could not have engaged in a more violentrevulsion against the stark Village flats , the lonely motel rooms , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied most of the ground floor and aspired to the ornateness of the most exclusive men 's clubs . The Anglophilic opulence of its Sheraton , Hepplewhite , Queen Anne and ponderous silver services summed up all that Larry Ross had aspired to in the 195os . Nibbling on translucentcaviar and radishes carved in the shapes of tulips , Edmund walked about the room with the critical eye of a seasoned fellow acquisitor . They 'd managed to paint their dining room a hideous shade of blue . It was awfully hard to mix an ugly blue , but they 'd quite succeeded . The Sheraton breakfront might have been elegant as a showcase for Greek pottery , but it was presently filled with a florid Sevres that clashed conspicuously with the fluting of English woodwork . And he should tell Sophie to apply a duller wax to her Queen Anne chairs , which presently shone with an almost vulgar maroon gleam . . . . " I 'm Mrs. Reilly 's chief butler , Mr. Edmund , sir ... . " Another turbaned black man was greeting him by name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood friendship ; she must felicitateher birthday guests upstairs but she told me that you were commencing a long voyage and asked me to see that you were adequatelyrefreshed as soon as possible upon your arrival . " " I 'll be up to see her in a moment , I 'm having a marvelous time looking at your splendid house . " " As you wish , sir . Madam warned me that you are of solitary disposition and might prefer to take a turn away from the maddening crowd . May I suggest that you enjoy a visit to the library on the mezzanine , to which Mr. Reilly has just added a collection of Jack Londoner . . . . You might also study our noted wine cellar , first door to the left in the hall .... " Edmund opted for the wine cellar , which he had already read about in the women 's page of The New York Times . " Ah , Sofka ,  |p173what  a sense of drama you 've developed ! " The arches and vaults of the cavernous space were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage set for the death scene of Romeo and Juliet . Edmund , so admired in Berkeley for his amusing little wines , took time to admire the velvety labels of ' 33 Mouton Lafites and 1885 Fine Napoleons , the silver tasting cups , marble boards and other refinements of the wine collector 's trade which accompanied the Reillys ' rare vintages . Edmund began to walk towards the second floor with great apprehension , infinitely dreading the revelation  --  surely startling  --  which Sophie 's hedonisticnew incarnation would offer . Reaching the second landing , still carefully avoiding the din of crowds and any room where he might find her , Edmund continued to climb the stairs to where he assumedhe would find the master bedrooms . He stood on the landing and stared at a wall ornated by two portraits of Sophie , one in a neosurreal vein ( walking by a tempestuous seashore in Victorian dress , holding a parasol ) and another cubistic enterprise in which her eyes descended in mournful triangles to her chin while she strummed on an eggplant-hued guitar . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven 's name had advised these outlandish commissions ? He must find out more ; from the door to the left came the familiar odor of Sophie 's rose toilet water ; he tiptoed towards it as reverently as an archaeologist approaches a cache unopened for decades . He opened the door , and was reassured . Only his dear Sophie could inhabit this room , it had a wondrous sense of impermanence , it looked as if she had just arrived or were about to leave , its floors were bare and uncarpeted , her clothes had n't even been put into any closet but hung from windows in lieu of curtains . The heaps of dusty books piled on the floor reflected the rich fluctuations of her interests  --  studies of Third World economicsand guidebooks to Hawaii , histories of Renaissance paintingsand exegeses of Marxist theory , biographies of Democratic presidents and of women physicists , how-to books on losing weight and improving recorder performance . And all about the room were strewn those traditional fetishes of her travels  --  postcards of Renoir nudes , photographs of the Mont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago in Italy . It was evident that she didp174not permit any member of her large domestic staff to even enter this precinct of the house . On a narrow , barely made single bed lay the same satchel which she and Edmund had shared during their trip to Tuscany , the stuffed koala bear which he remembered from Sealark and Charles Street . And what happened on this austere littleschoolgirl bed ? Not much , Edmund surmised , not much . Surprisedby the pleasure he derived from this vision , he now wandereddown the stairs towards the roar of the crowds as slowly as he could , paused a second at the landing and pushed his way towards the bar . " Large bourbon , straight up . " A dapper , silver-haired man with a black patch over his eye came towards Edmund , hand outstretched . " Ah , you 're her dreamboat , " B. B. Reilly said . " My wife still refers to you with that euphoric nomenclature . You seem to be an insuperable part of her early life . " Here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ florid language . Beebee spoke a kind of night-school English which seemed to have absorbed large doses of fresh vocabularywithout fully digesting them , and cloaked the faint trace of an undefinable foreign accent . " I 'm terribly glad to meet you , " Edmundsaid , raising his glass , " here 's to your great happiness . " " My wife has the most luminous judgment of any hostess in New York and she tells me that you 're catapulted towards a meteoric career in the field of art history . " " I 've just been voted tenure , " Edmund said as modestly as possible . " I may not get my full professorship for another two years . " " I wish you success in that transcendent enterprise . Your European background must allow you to perceive realitywith a detached retina . " " Have you been abroad a lot also ? " " I often travel for severely transactional reasons . . . . " Blue eyes . A handsome clean-shaven gent . The eye patch and the impeccably tailored clothes gave him the elegance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sucker for good looks . The relationship might be complicated . He did n't understand life . Edmund stood at the living room 's entrance and resumed his study of the Reillys ' decor . He startled at the sight of a half-dozen more portraits of Sophie hanging over the convoluted marble mantelpiece . Beebee 's esteem of his wife seemed to have expressed itself in a need to immortalize her features in as many pictorial styles asp175were known to the 196os . And what a choice of artists ! What were bestowed place of honor in this room but those currently fashionablemonstrosities which Professor Richter was decrying in classroomsand learned papers ! Hanging a few yards away over an Empiresettee were twelve multiple silk-screen portraits of Sophie by Andy Warhol . By the window , another triumph of Pop Art depictedher in a glaring kitchen , smiling at graphically detailed stacks of supermarket items . . . George Segal 's white plaster cast of Sophieseated in a chair , looking like a victim of the Pompeii earthquake . . . Sophie by Robert Rauschenberg , her features outlined against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ah yes she had always adored to pose ! And now she had spent the past year posing for those very idiots whom Edmund was attacking in several distinguished publications , and was about to savage at his forthcoming convention ! Beebee Reilly still stood at Edmund 's side , appearing to know as few people at his party as Edmund did . The garrulous guests filling the room seemed as purchased as the newly hung atrocities sullying Sophie 's image on the walls ; it was a gesticulating , middle-aged , ravenously eating throng dressed with the glittering maladroitness of the Reillys ' decor ; many women surmounted with hairdos of immense size and strange convolutions ogled each other with inarticulatemurmurs and shifted through the room like shoals of perplexedfish . . . . " The Chateau Lafitte forty-five I 've uncorked for my wife 's birthday is notorious for its contumelious bouquet , " Beebeewas saying . " I 've devised an unusually delightful way to exhibit our hostess 's beauty tonight ; I hope you will find the vision as delicateas I do . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could muster , for Larry Ross was hobbling towards him , crippled by a recent stroke , vastly fattened and baldened . Edmund held out his arms to this old protector . " Ah , Kinder , who are these dolts ? " Larry whispered as he embraced Edmund . " Is this what we sent her to Ethel Walker 's and Smith and Mara 's ballet school for ? What have these people accomplished , they 're not creative , they 're not famous , they 're not even young . . . and you , Edmund , the distinguished art historian , are you going to become the Berenson of our time ?  |p176Listen  , Mr. Renoir , if only you 'd stayed around , had some patience , by 1958 we could have had you at the top already , a truly distinguishedgallery , the Bergdorf Goodman of the art world like Betty Parsons and if not Parsons at least Sam Kootz ; one of his cousins was the brother of one of my big screenwriters . . . and by sixty-two we could have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great times for artists ... . " That 's the trouble , Larry , times may be too great . " All this dying was something was n't it , Maestro ? First Mrs. Sanfordand then Camilla , both gone a few years from each other , who else was there to survive ? But what a brave little girl he had in his Sophie , what a saint she 'd been to them , sharing every dollar she earned , free lancing night after night after her hard day 's work to pay for Camilla 's hospital bills , and now this Reilly was being most generous too , whoever he was . . . . Edmund suddenly heard Sophie 's pearly laugh ringing through the room ; his apprehension and curiosity became untenable . He excused himself from Larry and swiftly pushed his way through the crowds , he walked towards the familiar joyous sound , he reached the middle of the room and saw , from a distance . . . Sophie seated on a Louis XV chair , which in turn was set upon a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her adolescentweight since Edmund had last seen her , how much one could n't tell , for she was wrapped in a voluminous robe of studded tapestry that recalled the vestment of some primitive idol and a regal diamond tiara sat atop her mop of unruly gleaming hair . Seated on a throne , wrapped in tapestries that recalled the sack of Nineveh , the fall of Tyre , there was his Sophie . . . . " Sofka , " Edmundcalled out severely from the middle of the room , " Sofka , what the hell ? " She turned towards him and gave him her ebullient laugh , stretching out her jeweled hand with what he recognized to be profound tenderness . " Dreamboat , at last ! " Edmund elbowed his way farther through the tuxedoes , the taffetas , the whispers , the rhinestones , the garrulous voices , the tubs of rented caviar , the rented guests , remembering the sad ravenous emigres at the parties he and Mara had attended to relieve their hunger and their loneliness . Upon this moment of Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anguish and anger , productive and blazingyears , obsessed with acquisitions and honors and exhibitions of his conquests , replete with clever antiques , flamboyant Simonas , papers of great cleverness , lectures of devastating charm . For a very fleeting moment which would only return fully many years later  --  would then even change his life  --  Edmund was suddenly flooded with the desire to retreat to a distant place and support himself by humble occupations , mending nets , grinding corn , gardening for others , making sails , anything , anything rather than the rapacity of his past few years at Berkeley or the squalid glitter of the Reillys ' opulence . . . but this sense of gluttedness and guilt blazed only for a few seconds . Sophie continued smiling , he came towards her dais , renewed acquaintance with her smell of rose and musk ; the fertile odors thrust him into a dual state of panic and desire . Sofka , fellow sufferer on sailboats , beloved model of his brief and brilliant painting career , the most tenderly dutiful and giving of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she whom he had trusted would become a star of her generation ; had he been guilty of not clearly enough showing his love for her , not instilling enough courage ? " What do you think you 're doing , " he blurted out as he stood at the foot of her dais , " will you please get out of that ridiculous chair ? Immediately ! " " Marriage , " she laughed , " just another stage of life 's way . . . " She continued laughing and the fluted sound reassured him a little , perhaps the nomad was resting , drawing strength for future struggles in a rented tent , this travesty might be as brief as some of her earlier excursions , he would make sure it would be her last ! Sophie stretched out her arms towards him , he bent forward to touch her dear face , stumbled on the step of her dais and fell to the floor . Our lives are hidden from us , like our deaths , he thought as he lay briefly at her feet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie , impossible ! I 'll take care of you , I 'll kidnap you tonight , I 'll do anything to get you out of this monstrous place ! "  |p178HALFWAY  in the middle of their stay in the Soviet Union , Edmund decides that the whole trip might be a fiasco . Do n't kid yourself fellow the recovery of innocence is an idiotic enterprise . We 're diving into each other like pilots on reconnaissance missions , insights fitful , sometimes savage , we 're trying to turn back to some golden age which may have been more violent than we 've dared to admit ; the recapture of youth is as brutal as most nursery rhymes , here is a candle to light you to bed here is an ax to . . . In the last evenings of their stay in Leningrad , Edmund starts drinking with Evgeny . Sophie is out walking alone every night , allegedly documenting the attitudes of Soviet women to natural childbirth , detente , abortion ; half the time Claire is out searching for Sophie or else she 's trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Intourist party are equally irksome . Irina keeps chiding the Zabars for dropping out of the official tour to visit synagogues , " rubble of no historical significance . " Mrs. Jones has heard that face-lifts are free and wonderful in Russia and wants to come back with her friends to have it done here , Ah yes remont Edmund quips by all means have one . The Rolls-Roycers have broken three ashtrays at the Dollar Store after consuming too much vodka at lunch and Ted Weicker is praising the Soviet Union for its lowp179crime rate , where else in the West can you walk alone so safely at night ? Soviet bars close at ten o'clock . Edmund and Evgeny head for one of Leningrad 's foreign currency bars , dark chromed spaces filled with the din of rock , with vapors of American whiskeys and tobaccosunavailable to Soviets . Tempted but diffident , Evgeny follows Edmund to these haunts with a stealthy air . The ruby-mouthed Soviet women in deeply cleavaged silks who accompany some of the foreigners remind Edmund of the German officers ' molls who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edmund ordersa bottle of Black Label and often needles the Russian about the state of his country . " I 've evolved a new theory on this trip , Evgeny , I 've realized that civilizations contact each other through their poisons . Take heed , brother , think of the way the Indians were done in by our first colonizers ; it 's our liquor those poor bastards wanted rather than our alphabets or medicines , just the way you crave our Marlboros and Pepsis and odious music without giving a hoot about our humanrights . . . . Look at this Western decadence which you 'd all sell your icons for if you had any left ; your country reminds me of a fruit that 's rotting before it 's even had a chance to ripen . Listen , Evgeny , if I were a member of your Politburo I 'd be more authoritarianin these matters , more severe . . . " Severe ? " the Russian repeats loudly over the din of the rock , keeping his spectacled eyes on Edmund . " Severe , severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd wish on you is to become like us . If I were one of your leaders I 'd safeguard our ancient Slavic values , resurrect our glorious ethnic traditions ; oh , I 'm an unabashed romantic , I 'd only allow balalaikas , Georgian songs , Kalmyk zithers , Cossack dances . . . in old times your cravingfor debased Westernness was restricted to the upper crust but now you 've become one huge beggar 's opera ; look at how these dens are corrupting your youth with their black markets ! " Evgeny resettles his spectacles with a firm thrust of his fifth finger . " One position is that we 're still suffering from the aftermath of the Great War , Gedmund ; your foreign currency is immeasurably helpful to our economy . "  | " One position , brother , is that you 're brilliant at finding excuses for every shortcoming you have .

" " Oh do n't take us as a model , Evgeny , I 'd close it down , close it all down . " " Time may have come for you to start defining human obligationsalong with human rights , Gedmund . . . . " You 've put your finger on the American tragedy , dear friend ; our honeymoon with spineless permissiveness is over ! We 're yearningfor restrictions , authority , tens of thousands of our kids joining half-crazed religious cults in which they 're programmed like robots around the clock ; you 're seeing in us Narcissus in Chaos , the final wasteland of bourgeois individualism . . . . " There were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women you travel with , Gedmund , you 've known them for long ? " " Thirty years . " " Perhaps you were almost married once to one of them ? " " Almost to both of them . " " Colossalnoedelo , " the Russian murmurs , " a colossal feat . The thin darker one , she is always trying to phone Moscow , she has relatives there ? " " Relatives of friends , trifles , I would n't bother with it in your KGB reports . " " And which one is more difficult to live with ? " " Oh , do n't ask me , brother , they 've both become impossible , impossible , perhaps they always were . . . . Do you expect me to live with simple women , without divinities ? I 'll never settle for a modified rapture. . . let 's drink in reckless communion , Evgeny Sergeie-vich ! " After a half bottle Evgeny offers sparse details of his own life.  |p181During  the height of the Stalinist terror his family had stayed up until dawn hours playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KGB , going to bed only in exhaustion . . . he 'd once been much in love with a teacher of history who became too interested in Polish culture . . . he 'd once written a paper on Dreiser at university , he might soon leave Intourist work and take an advanced degree . . . after such moments of candor he picks up his coat and explains that he must go home because his grandmotheris waiting for him , his grandfather has a kidney disease , a cousin is arriving from Lvov . " Communists always want to go home , " Edmund sighs . Evgeny gives a guarded smile , taps his knee with his Pravda as he reminds Edmund of the next morning 's tour schedule . Their conversations often end with Evgeny saying , " Ah yes this is Wonderland Gedmund Petrovich . " " Wonderland , right ? " One night on their way out of the hotel Edmund and Evgeny pass some members of their Intourist group in a corridor . One of the Rolls-Royce couples is trying to entice the Zabars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate this gorgeous country , Zabs , clean as a whistle ! No longhair kids standing in Red Square yelling hell no we wo n't go ! " " No Gay Lib , " his wife adds assertively . " You think we 're crazy , Prof , " the Floridian says to Edmund with his wide disheveled smile . " Here 's to effete intellectual snobs , " his wife raises her glass . The Zabars are trying to be pastoral , proposing Bisodol , urging an early bedtime because of the 7:oo A.M. waking scheduled for the next morning . The Rolls-Roycers ' lapels are replete with insignias of Lenin exchanged with Soviet teenagers for T-shirts and gum  --  Lenin aged four , cherubic and blond-curled as Baby Jesus , Lenin as high schooler , Lenin as fiercely bearded leader . " We too are a Wonderland , Evgeny , " Edmund says as they leave for their evening outing . Sophie burst into the bar of the Astoria shortly after midnight . " Soph my love , what have you been up to this time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edmund ; I climbed upthe stairs to Raskolnikov 's room , saw the courtyard on whichSonya 's window looked out . . .  |p182Claire  came in next . " Oh thank God , she 's here . . . I was so worried . I saw her walking by the Admiralty and then I lost sight of her in the dark . . . . " Edmund stared at Claire and continued trying to understand her after thirty years . She stood above them fingering a variety of papersstuffed into her boyish raincoat , her skin the color of clean sand after a storm , looking at the bar with her haughty , abstracted glance . " I may return , " she said after hugging Sophie . " I must go upstairs to finish some letters . " " Do n't worry , dear heart , " Sophie called out after her , " I 've survivedalone in the streets of more perverse cities . . . . " She downed her Scotch in one gulp , put her arm around Edmund . " Ah if you knew what extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . unearthly . . . or perhaps too earthly . Let me explain . . " Let her explain . " Edmund leaned his head back on Sophie 's shoulder . " We 'll have one of our frequent consciousness-lowering sessions . " " Well I 'll start with Claire , it 's easier , more brutal . I 'm a Slav too , Genia , and I 'm inebriated with candor tonight ! When we were young I used to see her pacifism as a kind of magnet which could absorb all evil in her own frail person . . . " " Oh her nonviolence is of sterner ore than any knives , Genia , her silences are bombs with time fuses . " " But later on I saw a few more dangerous things in that purity of hers  --  it 's genuine , mind you , genuine , yet what has it done but trigger us to more and more outrageous behavior !

Four Swedes sang " Auld Lang Syne " and loudly clapped while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , a drunken young Russian accompanying a group of Danes weaved about the bar yelling obscenities , Evgeny rapped his Pravda nervouslyagainst his chair . " Have you ever had anyone like that in your life , Genia , " Sophie leaned across the table towards the Russian , " someone whose puritydestroys ? She 's moved by compassion for the world and the lives she 's touched most deeply may be ruined ! "  | " How well you understand human nature ! " the Russian shouted with feeling . " She 's ruined our lives has n't she Eddem , but with such style ! " " Turn off the soap opera , Soph . " " Well you came here for the truth , did n't you Edmund ? " " I 'm not sure anymore my love . " Edmund refilled their drinks , sat between them , arms folded . " I 'm beginning to think that we need illusions even more than truth if the three of us are going to live together from now on . " " Live together ? Who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say so . Right now . I thought of it just now , at this very moment . I think we 've totally fucked up going it alone , especially you and I. ... I 'm about to propose it at our next plenary session , propose some revolutionary form of triadic household . " " But you will torment each other so , " the Russian lamented . " The three of us , what madness ! As usual you 're terrified , you 're avoiding your real needs , Edmund . .. . " " What is he doing ? " the Russian shouted over the din of the rock . " Avoiding , avoiding ! It 's her alone you want , Edmund , her alone ! Why not just grab her now that she 's finally free ? " " You are all so Slavic ! " the Russian exclaimed . . . I need to be more refueled than ever with illusions , Sophie , and I ca n't abide this hemorrhage of openness . . . " " The more Clara tortures you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes , what insights our friend has , she 's indeed grown increasinglydependent on us over the years ! " Late at night Evgeny 's pale leonine head nodded slowly , methodically , over each word . " How I enjoy your calisthenics of the soul ! " " Love is only one thing , Genia , " Sophie said , " it 's the willingness to die for the other . . . . I 've come to your country with the only two people I 've ever known for whom I 'd willingly give up my life ! " " Your heroic fidelity to each other moves me so , " the Russianp184exulted . " A toast to her , to the mysterious third one ! " " Yes yes , " Sophie cried , " to her who 's clarified our lives by the suffering she 's brought us ... " They drank . " Do let 's toast some more cheerful matters , Gedmund ! " " To the noble suffering of the artist , Evgeny Sergeievich !

" To your tears , Sofia Larionovna , " Evgeny drank , " to Sofia 's tears ! " " Yes , to her beloved tears ! " Edmund came knocking at Claire 's door early that morning complaining of a furious headache ; perhaps he might have come to her without that excuse  --  she hovered at the door 's edge in a long childlike white nightgown , rubbing her eyes  --  the hotel window behind her opened out upon the tuliped expanse of St. Isaac 's Square  --  as he engaged her firm , tense body for the first time that year he was reminded that this most severe of individualists would only come to him at her own pace , her own time , refusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the twenty-five years of their extremely rare lovemakings he 'd learned that there was no frigidity at the core of her abstinent life , that her complex , delicate flesh could be as unleashed as that of any woman he 'd known  --  Radiant 5:0o A.M. light flooded her oval face as she stared at him with pale eyes drained of their habitual defiance or aloofness , filled with an almost sassy playfulness , as if she enjoyed the surprise he had in her unfettering  --  He put his lips to her face in a ritual sequence he 'd begun a quarter of a century ago , first on a cheek , then on each closed eyelid ; how maddening she must be to otherp185men because of her ability to control lust , making her rare gifts of it with freedom incomparable  --  he 'd come to think of sexual encountersas a quest for information executed in a spirit of curiosity and high playfulness ; a line had been haunting him , " Je ne veux pas jouir , je ne veux que savoir , ' " he whispered to Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this satisfaction she held back , her Nordic eyes reflected nothing but an immensely serene affection , the self-containment of a planet  --  he fell asleep feeling gratitude for a life in which a rich full spectrum of friendship , passion , brotherly love had been incarnated into each of his two deepest bondings  --  when he woke , Claire had already left the room , he rememberedwith a burst of immense joy that it was the day to go to the Hermitage . " What a crazy night we had , " he told the Zabars and the Weickers at breakfast , " everyone was drunk , the Swedes were singing , the Russians were weeping , or perhaps the other way around , I do n't know anymore , you never know in this country . "  |p186THE  ferry blew its amazing horn before it came into sight . Edmund stood at the Hyannis landing playing the game he 'd once shared with his mother , choosing the most magnificent family scheduled to board the vessel . He settled on a Buick whose cargo included six bicycles and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , three enormous and anxiousIrish setters ( he 'd always remembered an abundance of setters on the island , as if they were a more trustable token of family bliss than poodles or terriers ) , a proliferation of barbecue grills , tennis rackets , picnic hampers , and two parents of some beauty impatientlywaiting for the boarding to begin . The slender , green-eyed femaleof the pair stepped out of the car to assess the imminence of the ship 's arrival to Hyannis , staring fiercely at nothing in the manner of athletic women . Her setters yapped nervously at a pug on the road , beach towels tumbled out of hampers , her flaxen-haired children were arguing among themselves , the eight-year-old pulled at his younger sister 's ear , the child protested with shrill cries , the older girl  --  a beauty of fourteen or so , the same age at which Edmundhad first met Claire  --  reprimanded her siblings while carefullyrebraiding her long pale hair . The mother chided gently also , turning her head towards her brood with a soft laugh , whispering to her husband do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edmundp187stood among the fishing instruments , the beach gear , the remonstrances , the Andover T-shirts , the vapors of copulation and nourishment , he remembered how the ferry had looked to him two decades ago ; it had glided across the dark water like a blazing caterpillar , metamorphosing into a moth of bridal whiteness as it slid past the lighthouse . But when it rounded the cape this morning it changed from insect to mammal in the space of a few moments , it plowed through the oily sound with the heaviness of a wounded whale , spluttered and spit as it spun on its engines to thrust its maws towards the dock ; Edmund lost the image of lightness , bridal whiteness , the ferry had become . . . something else . He had just turned thirty-five this past spring , and in a few weeks Claire would be thirty-five also . The vessel made its final docking , slid into the oily fences of its berth and expelled scores of vehicles  --  food trucks , early thrifty vacationers returning to the gloom of summer cities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its joy , their setters panted quickly , their blue Buick slid voluptuously into the ferry . Halfway into the passage Edmund had a talk with a clergyman of extreme black and whiteness  --  pale eyes , silver hair , white socks , sternly black little suitcase . The priest expressed interest in the fact that Edmund hoped to soon become chairman of Berkeley 's art historydepartment and spoke movingly about the Church of it Gesu in Rome . They went on to an amusing conversation about grace ; the priest was clearly a Jansenist . " It comes down upon you like rain . " He fluttered his dark arms upwards , his long pale fingernails clicking above his head like castanets . The Nantucket coast finally came into sight , offering its beauty like a Puritan woman baring her breast , uncleaned pearls of pale gray houses spread against the harbor , docks filled with coquettish shops which Edmund did not rememberthere a decade ago . It was shortly before noon when the vessel docked . And stepping alone onto the pier amid the throng of vacationers Edmund decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours . A handsome risk , looking up such friends after six years , he 'd been wary of it for months . So he started driftingthrough the town , peered into Lilliputian gardens and houses that had so enchanted him decades ago , tried to recapture thep188island 's nursery-rhyme spell , walked aimlessly down thoroughfares called Coon Street , Beaver Street , New Dollar Lane . Within a half hour he realized that he was more or less following the movements of the couple he 'd studied at the Hyannis landing . They were easy to sight by the splendor of their hair , their children , their dogs . And he proceeded to linger behind them even more meticulously , lurkinga block away , feeling like a thief as he watched them act their roles in this theater of family happiness . How many children there were about , filling the streets ! The infant population drenched the air with small sounds of crude and tender timbre , like the din of verbiage in high wind . On tepid threatening days not fine enough for the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slickers and high boots . It was the Fourth of July ( national birthday of a people more dedicated than any other to the cult of happiness ) and Edmundwondered whether he could feel part of these happy crowds if he acquired the right props : a child to hold by the hand , a sand pail , a little striped umbrella . He followed his adopted family for another hour at proper distance , admiring the beauty of the children about him , marveling at what it would be like to have married Pebble and be vacationing like this every day of the month , answering his son 's questions about birds as he biked downtown for his morning papers , wondering when the wife 's period would be over , feeling solicitous about a baby 's bowel movements , worrying about the ingress and egress of several earthly frames . Whatever happiness he 'd had was of such a different order that he barely felt part of the humanity milling about him . He often felt the burden of his solitude ; I sometimeswish we could reproduce alone he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , sculpting part of our bodies into perfectchildren the way we try to shape our students . . . . Edmund remained a respectful block behind his adopted family as they stood in line at a bakery , procrastinating his view of Sealark for a while longer and wondering what life was about . The family 's mood had become exacerbated . " I 'll sock you one if you do n't stop yiping , " the ten-year-old shouted at the freckled four-year-old . " I shall not have that language in my house , Jeremy , "  |p189the  beautiful mother exclaimed . " I hate islands , " the eight-year-old offered . " The children are tired , " Father said . " Do we have enough beach chairs , honey ? " " Of course , sweetheart . " " And towels ? " " Yes , yes , love . " They received what they 'd stood in line for and six mouths gravely bit into six sugared doughnuts . Edmund suddenly felt bullied by the purchasing , staring , chewing crowd ; all that was ogled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its lobster-infested place mats and wooden captain dolls ; he 'd stared and loitered with others , he 'd sat in the sun licking an icecreamcone and bought a vulgar T-shirt , at two in the afternoon he ceased following the vacationing family and walked back to the ferrylanding , he hovered over the ropes by which he 'd stood with Mara decades ago at the end of the worst holocaust in human history . And then he started walking towards the Sanford house , trying to recall a line of Sartre 's that Mirsky had recently read him , " I did not know what to do with my body , ' " how did it go .. . ah , there it was , " I did not know what to do with my body in the midst of this tragic crowd which was struggling to amuse itself . ' " Claire Sanford Howell has gutted and eviscerated her mother 's house , scrubbed it of nearly every vestige of her childhood . Gone is the china striving to imitate the shapes of frogs and various forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roses and carnations , the ducks swimming across green swatches of petit point ponds . All is now limpidly white and unadorned , remindingEdmund of Claire 's own pale face when it emerges from the water after a swim . Frenzied chintzes and floral rugs have given way to monastic burlaps and raffias , Babsie 's wondrous flower arrangementshave been replaced by a few trailings of beach foliage and seashells arranged in geometric patterns upon denuded tables . But the most amazing change of all has occurred on the walls ! Claire has turned Sealark into a veritable museum of social protest . The living room , which first undergoes Edmund 's scrutiny , literally swarms with photographs of humans marching , picketing , fasting , getting arrested for the cause of peace or of equality . And all is carefully dated and labeled , with Claire 's particular brand of didac/tic care , with fastidious concern for educating the most casual visitorinto'the various reform movements that have swept America in the past century . God knows Claire 's interest is not new , simply more systematic . Hanging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolitionist , Lucretia Mott , whose burning Quaker gaze is familiar to Edmund from the walls of Claire 's childhood room . The air of wasted constancy on the faces of the colleagues who surround her , the stubborn stance of their folded arms , the severe part in the women 's flat hair , exude the rigor of purpose that now pervades the house . In 1918 twelve women in large hats clench their fists as they sail for The Hague to plead for the end of all wars , conscientious objectors are herded into a Utah jail . Some years and decades later throngs protest the indictment of Sacco and Vanzetti , Jeannette Rankin is besieged by reporters shortly after she has cast the only vote in Congress opposing its declaration of war against Japan , the civil servant Rosa Parks is dragged to jail after refusing to move out of her bus seat . Amid parades of societies opposed to the vivisection of animals and posters advertising meat-replacing substitutes , Edmund also recognizes Sir Bertrand Russell being arrestedin an anti-nuclear sit-in in London , A. J. Muste leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he wanders through rooms once florally serene Edmund is perplexed by this proliferation of humanity being herded through streets and thrust into paddywagons , this melee of contorted faces shouting for many varietiesof liberation . Yes , too many ! That is perhaps Claire 's tragic flaw . The diversity of causes dramatized on these walls  --  suffragism , vegetarianism , laborers ' rights , animal rights , numerous varietiesof pacifism  --  expresses an almost frivolous abundance of dissentingpassions . .. . Edmund stared out of the window at the unchanged view he 'd painted two decades earlier  --  rowboats bobbing like petals on the glass of the harbor , yachts steered by tall blond men playing captain setting out for an afternoon sail . And when his eyes turned from this serene idleness to the images of struggle scattered about Claire 's rooms he felt more at peace than he 'd felt for several years . He would realize much later  --  Edmund always realized things awfullyp191late  --  the reasons for his surge of pleasure : palpable proof that Claire was not suited for the docile felicity Plinker and Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mutual complexityof destiny . . . . It was close to four o'clock . Under the arrogantlypeaceful face of Bertrand Russell that surmounted the hallwaytable a note informed him of the Howells ' afternoon schedule . He seized one of the bicycles leaning against the garden fence and pedaled to the tennis club . Edmund could have known that if Claire ever resumed her island life he would find her on a tennis court at 4:0o P.M. , and not at base line but right at that net position where she 'd spent much of her adolescence , volleying the ball with that swift aggressive turn of her shoulders which he 'd always thought of as her most characteristic gesture . This is precisely where he did find her , but the following was less predictable : Right there at net , Pebble was threatening to throw a fit . As coltish as ever and dressed in virginal white , she was shouting at her husband , who was about to start a match of mixed doubles two courts away : " Now for Christ 's sake , Jeff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know perfectly well that dozens of my friends can be arrested down there at any moment . . . really ! " " How many times have you forgotten to give me messages , honey , " he said with a cordial smile . " Yes , about some damn hockey game or faculty meeting , not about matters of life and death , what time is it precisely , Jeff ? " He was languorously swinging his racket in preparation for service . " Oh , I guess around four or thereabout . " " For heaven 's sake , I asked precisely what time is it ? " she cried once more . She threw her racket to the ground and ran off the court towards the clubhouse , pleated skirt waving about her thighs like that of a teenage gymnast , leaving her own doubles matches stranded . " It 's precisely two and a half after , " Jeff called out after her , " just look at the club clock , Feb ! " Edmund had witnessedthe preceding scene from some fifty yards away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smiling apology to his pretty partner , " Sorry , Rose sweetheart , Pebble 's constant damn crusade in the Deep South . " Jeff bent down to tie the laces of his sneakers . He kept his head up as he kneeled , radiating his amiable serenity towards the courts.  |p192Not  one of his three oldest friends , Edmund reflected , had changed so little since adolescence . There was still the beginning of an ingenuoussmile on Jeff 's lips , an expression of optimism so unaltered that one imagined he retained it in the privacy of his ablutions . Living with this large , sumptuously beautiful man might have been like living under some tall belfry clock which struck each hour with a resounding din to reassure us of the excellent order of mankind . Since adolescence Jeff had stared with equally affectionate protectivenessat boats in the harbor , strangers in streets , children in playpens . And this benignancy was negligible compared to the reverencehe offered those persons he might have been the last of his generation to call " the fair sex . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say when he looked at a handsome woman . " You can be my redeemer , my guidance and inspiration ! " " Careful crossing the street , " Edmund remembered Jeff saying throughout their adolescence as Claire , Sophie , April , Babsie , ventured towards Main Street on the smallest errand . " Careful crossing the street ! " he shouted again in New York City as they exited from theater or debutante dance . Yet there was a strain of nastiness in Jeff which had to do with virtue . Like Pebble he was ever ready to carry the burden of others . But unlike her crusades for voter registration in the South his were the concrete familiar others , childhood friends , blood-kin tribe . And he wished his virtue properly exhibited , his gifts of happiness meticulously accounted for . If the rescued did not collaborate with the rescuing procedures according to Jeff 's own ideals of felicity he was capable of sabotaging the whole mission . . . . After he finished tying his sneaker that afternoon Jeff turned again towards his pretty partner with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smile waned into a gaze of cynical annoyance as he saw Claire slam the door of the clubhouse . He clutched his racket rather grimly and prepared for service . His afternoon match was ill-fated , for it was then that he saw Edmund and called out to Plinker , who had been sitting in a chair by the court with a small girl on his lap : " Look who 's here , Plink , look who 's finally come back to us ! " And before clutching Jeff 's shoulders Edmund saw the old man hobbling towards him too , arms outstretched , accompanied by a girl of six so strikingly resem/blant to Claire as a child that Edmund could have shouted out with the pain of memory . " So . . . have you come to stare at my happiness , rabbit love ? " Claire was kneeling in her parents ' former vegetable garden , diggingup clumps of weeds , chucking them haphazardly over the fence . " People come to stare at each other 's happiness in these resorts the way Sunday visitors go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families parading their delight like protesters carrying pickets , bigsigns saying PERFECT AMERICAN FAMILY , BE THE PERFECT FAMILY ! " She continued digging , not looking at him . " I expect that 's the way you expected to find me , sitting on the beach with needlepoint of ducks on a green pond , bustling children about proclaiming our bliss . . . well if you 've come to stare at my felicity dear one you should get a refund on your boat fare . . .. " " I miss Babsie 's flowers , " Edmund said . She glanced up at him with a bitter , wry little smile . " Ah you would miss her flowers , would n't you ? . . . Well I 'm not Babsie and I 'm not April and there is n't enough of dear Plinker in me either , maybe I should leave you here to keep housey with Jeff .... " " I 'm going back to Alabama next week , " she added bluntly . " There 's a lot of work to be done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like bolts of sand-colored satin . She 'd changed little since the brief visit he 'd paid the Howells in England six years ago save for the very fine lines about her eyes , which intensified the anger of her gaze . This trace of the passing of time struck Edmund as sharply as a change in his own body . " A little lettuce , parsley , carrots , I 'm seeding it all before I go South again . . . . Plinker would be despondent if he did n't see something growing here before summer 's end , just a few goodies to keep them quiet . " " I 'm sure you 're doing the right thing . . . the garden before leaving , I mean . " " Oh , do contradict me more than that , " she whispered . " Aren'tp194you going to dispute me as you always used to , E. R. ? Have you come back after all these years just to agree with me ? " As she pulled up a clump of weeds and threw it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loam . Poor rabbit hurt his paw , Vicky put it in a splint maybe ? Plinker was walking from the boat landing to the house , holding Victoria 's hand . She clutched a basket in which a tiny animalreposed . Victoria was frail and pensive , with light brown hair and glacial blue eyes that tortured Edmund with remembrance . Plinker 's walk was made very slow , more majestic than ever by his gout ; he could only see at close distance and from his lawn he gave all passersby the wave of a royal personage passing through crowds in a limousine . That 's Uncle Edmund over there , Mummy and Daddy 's oldest friend , does n't Victoria want to give Uncle Eddem a good-night kiss ? All right sweets , later . " Oh I could have continued to play Elgar so beautifullyat St. Paul 's commencements , Eddem , I could have gone on sitting there year after year seeing that bright ribbon of life go by , hearing a racist headmaster mouth his platitudes about being better Americans let us praise Thee Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children onto the road of manhood , Jeff always cried at commencement , those beautiful rich boys seemed to carry his only assurance of immortality , his only faith in the ancient order being able to forever perpetuate itself . .. . " She had migrated to the other side of the lawn , to the abandoned cutting garden where her mother 's parterres had once bloomed in such profusion . " Achillea , " she muttered , " does best in dry exposed places , like me . Hemerocallis , each bloom lasts for a single day , as I do in this house . . . . You know what 's wrong with me , Eddem , I 've simply never wanted to be like any woman I 've ever known in real life . Not like my poor loving Babsie who grew mad in the gathering of flowers or the tragically happy classmates I still meet in the streets of Boston , wheeling prams with the smell of morning sherry on their breath . . .. "  | " You were always the quintessential critic . " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? He has a nasty gift of mimicry , he 's like an immense pair of spectacles through which all of the world 's ills are hugely magnified , he 's grown so omnivorous that he needs to be curbed . . . or better , anchored to a communityof critics . My critic needs group support , that 's why he 's off to Alabama . . .. " She looked up at him with that cunning which those who profess unworldliness can wield like a club of stone . " What about Viola Liuzzo , a woman just like me looking for salvation ? " Fog rolling in from the ocean . Town wrapped in banks of misty brilliance . Thumping of the day 's last tennis balls , Rap of furling sails from the Yacht Club around the corner . Plinker walking up a neighbor 's path in the property next door , teaching Victoria names of flowers that had long since disappeared from Sealark . Lily of the valley , plant pips two inches apart , it 's that little thing every pretty bride must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching death : " The confessor , who had been with him in the inner chamber , ran forth in tears and whispered that his last confession had been that of a child of five . " Claire gestured to Edmund as she moved from one part of the property to another ; she seemed to want him continually by her side during her tasks . " And what about you , Eddem ? You 've had your Guggenheim and your associate professorship , next year you 'll start getting honorarydoctorates and distinguished chairs here and there , what kind of a future do you dream of for yourself ? " He cleared his throat . He joined his index fingers thoughtfully to his blond beard , Dr. Richter charming audiences from the lectern . " Well , many things . Having power for instance . Give me two or three years to get the chairmanship of the department and I 'll reallyp196clean it up , restore all kinds of outmoded disciplines . No more **25;8408;TOOLONG , much stress on classics and iconography ... " She stared up at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury the positivistic nonsense ; I 'll make it the best traditional school in the country . I also look forward to being sixty-six ; upon retirement I 'll move to Venice into a strictly inodorous palace with cooks , frescoes , tapestries . .. " She burst out laughing with all the abandon of her youth . " I 'll look like a tenor who 's too old to make love but is still redolentwith charm , I 'll wish for conversion each time I hear the organ , the Reverend Edwards already has great hopes for me . " She threw spadefuls of earth playfully over her shoulder and he knew that underneath what he now saw as mayhem she was as resilient as ever . " Ah Eddem we do need you to wake us from our Puritan earnestness , as Babsie used to say . Now . What about our Soph ? " " Oh I tried hard enough to get her to come up this weekend ; between the two of us we might have straightened her out a bit ... " " Eddem dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom she was in last year , the manic hedonism of this season . " " I 've always thought of psychoanalysis as a science for moral parvenus , " Edmund said . " Yet her fluctuations are such it might be a last resort . . .. " " However , " he added pointedly , " she retains the courage of frivolity , as I do . " The one time Edmund saw Claire and Jeff alone together they were discussing matters of the household with attemptedcivility . " Beach chairs , Clairsie . " " Do you mind ? " " Not at all , I 'll go on the A.M. Also , April phoned , Katrinka has no room for her and she wants to drop in on us next weekend with the children . "  | " How beastly . " " Now , sweets , it 's the family ! We 'll do a clambake the day she comes , and the next afternoon we can have a nifty sail to Siasconset. . . do give it your one oh oh , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One oh oh , " she murmured as she picked lettuce for supper , looking absentminded . Before dinner Edmund was asked to hold Victoria on his lap . It is possible that he had never had a child on his lap before . It is possible that he had never before closely experienced the smell of a young child 's flesh . The texture , the odor , of Victoria'sface was terrifying in its novelty . In this flesh of palpitating innocence there was already some principle of procreation which he had never detected  --  perhaps never dared detect  --  in her mother 's wiry body . He put his face close to the child 's hair , closed his eyes , inhaled deeply . In the immaculacy of her hair 's fragrance he recalledsome moment and texture of his own childhood that had slipped into oblivion , some smell of his own body being scrubbed by Mara . The child turned her face swiftly towards him and he felt the inexplicable delicacy of her skin upon his cheek like the brush of a flower 's pistil . The fleeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the somber weight of that splendidly groomed body of his which had never reproduced , which had seldom merged with its highest object of desire , this girl 's mother . . . . And who would bring up this superb child ? Women were leaving home to find a possible death in good causes , schools were dissolving under the threat of radical idiots , the daughters of women who 'd gone mad from staying at home were going mad from being too much in the world . He missed intensely throughout this visit the presence of Elizabeth Sanford , that half-crazed creature of commonplace conversationwhose singular contribution ( and he suspected it was a gift peculiar to women ) had been to bring comfort to those about her . I 'm becoming more conservative than ever , Edmund reflected with pleasure . Before Victoria went to bed Claire embraced her daughter with a tense desperate tenderness and held her very tight . She sat her onp198her lap and brushed her hair with the silver-handled brush that had belonged to Babsie . How the child delighted in her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's arms all afternoon . But now she sucked her thumb , eyes closed , her head collapsed against her mother 's shoulder as if it were the only place in which she could abandon herself to her childhood . After Victoria 's hair was straight and gleaming Claire clutched her again and rocked her softly , eyes closed . Looking suntanned , rested and moral , Jeff sat in his upstairs study that evening writing mail-order houses for numerousarticles with which to ornate his denuded house . He ordered shell-shaped night-lights , monogrammed note pads , creme bailee ramekins , cocktail glasses etched with herons sailing across brilliant skies . He had told Edmund as they 'd biked home from the tennis club that his dream was to retire fairly early from the teaching professionand live year round in this part of New England , supporting himself " by some profitable little local commerce . " Designing nauticalinstruments . . . strengthening the local lobster industry . . . he might import some sheep , as he had in Great Britain . . . useless to even mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of ever living on the island . . . meanwhile he aspired to make the house as comfortable as Babsie had had it . As Edmund sat sipping Scotch with him that evening Jeff lovingly studied offerings of bowl and whisk sets , wind-chill meters , butter churners , portable weaving looms . " See , Eddem , the trouble is that I looked forward to marriage more than to anything else in the world ! I was going to be a great husband the way I was going to be a great teacher ; I wanted to have four children and build a perfect little community .... " " You poor bastard . " " D' you know the single most important thing we 're doing in a great school like St. Paul 's , Edmo ? We 're training good husbands , loyal men . What better service can we offer society than to train them for ideal marriages ? " Edmund was damned if he was going to shape students into idealp199husbands but it was n't the right time to differ ; he was agreeing with everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Sealark 's attic , two floors above Claire 's displays of fasting pacifistsand picketing monks , Jeff had installed a veritable sanctuary of military values . Walls adorned with portraits of uniformed ancestors  --  AdmiralHowell , strikingly resembling his offspring , leans on his sword during a lull in the Spanish-American War ; General Howell of the Battle of the Bulge stands in a field in Flanders , foot poised on a cannon . All about the floor of Jeff 's refuge the elaborate collection of toy soldiers from all ages of mankind which Edmund had so admired in their adolescence  --  silver-helmeted Roman legionsshoot arrows from clusters of plastic trees , medieval foot soldierscharge across moats and drawbridges , generals in crimson jackets inspect regiments ; and at center stage a two-inch-high Napoleon , hand thrust into his vest , is led away by one of Wellington 's blue-jacketed aides-de-camp . " You know what the schoolboy is , Edmo ? He 's like a base ore that can be forged into precious metal in the crucible of a great school and then polished to shine with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him as young as possible , to forge his courage and loyalty ; one of the masters has a neat way of putting it , Eddem , he compares it to making a perfect martini . You need the right proportionsof unswerving loyalty and individualism , the old geezer says , the loyalty of the character is the gin . . . but Edmo the way young anarchists are going today they 're getting to be like a ghastly potion of ninety percent vermouth ! " " I know only too well , they 're odious . " " I work my ass off to correct the balance , Eddem ; I teach three history courses , coach two sports , advise the military history club , I have seminar on sixth-form responsibilities Tuesday and Wednesdaynight , sex education on Thursday , I take my turn in chapel once a week ; teaching is a continuous act of faith . . . like great husbands , Eddem , good teachers are paragons of loyalty and firmness who 're capable of exploding in righteous indignation . .. . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other at the table laden with Jeff 's books of military history , finishing the bottle of whiskey set between them . " And what are you going to do about her ? " Jeff opened his arms with a helpless gesture that added to the irony of his smile . He 'd always been reluctant to discuss his private life with anyone , nothing Edmund respected more . " I do n't mind if women take over the world , old sport , what I 'm afraid of is their values . . . sensitivity to the suffering of unknown hordes , splendid on the private plane but what if it enters the realm of public affairs , forces the masculine tone to pass from the nation ? " " Quite so , a reign of mediocrity , hollow phrases about better worlds ! " " After we get through with animals ' rights they 'll give us theories about plants having emotions , rocks feeling pain , there 's no end to it , Eddem , how are we ever going to feed the planet ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concerned with the survival of the family , " Edmund sighed . The bottle was depleted . Even as an adolescent Jeff had had the most honorable manner of holding his liquor , amiablecheeks flushing , smile widening into the evening until he fell benignly asleep in some chair . Even now when he more or less fell onto the sofa the gesture had a certain choreographic splendor . " Peb and I will make up tomorrow and she 'll have a super plan for saving the Congolese . . . where are you going ? " Jeff muttered as Edmund paced about his study . " Nowhere . .. I mean , I might take a turn around the block a bit later . " " Careful crossing the street , " Jeff whispered , and then fell into a deep sleep . Sitting at the table littered with volumes of military history Edmund felt sadness in the felling of this simple complex man . Fellows like Plinker and Jeff were becoming like snow leopards , an endangered species . Edmundhad returned to the island longing to taste again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historic order that had nourished his fragile exiled self upon his arrival in America . And if this most stalwart of worlds was crumbling where was the refuge , could thep201center ever hold ? Edmund raised Jeff 's feet up more comfortably onto the sofa , put a pillow under his head , continued staring at him by the light of the army lamp that illuminated Jeff 's toy battles . There was in Jeff a Puritan Don Giovanni which incited him to aspire to the unconquerable , to climb every Everest of the eroticallyaccessible , even there clearly exhibited valor was of the essence . He 'd probably persevered to win Claire precisely because she was so particularly unseductable , and when the process of taming her ran amok his moods might well turn vile . There lay le Puritain Moyen Sensuel , Jeff of the loyal hard-on , Jeff of the dutiful erection ; in sleep his profile was almost feminine in its beauty , resembled Donatello 's David . Edmund looked out the window and stared at the tragic set of New England innocence it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that frozen nostalgia for a purer age shouting through the white spires of floodlit churches . When Plinker and Jeff would be called away the heroic age of America would come to end , age of high ideals and the most elegant hypocrisies . He did n't wish to leave that fragrant face of Jeff 's which even in sleep continued to shroud all pains in a benign ironic smile ; he would have been happy spending the night on the same couch , coiled in whatever remained of Jeff 's certitude . He went to bed humming an old school song familiar to the Sanfordsand the Howells . " Hath he fulfilled the promise of his youth . .. and borne unscath'dthrough danger 's stormy fields . . . Honor 's white wreath and virtue 's stainless shield . . . " " Almighty Father bless our land with honorable industry sound learning and pure manners defend our liberties as Thou has in the recent world upheaval and grace our house as we have honored Thee in Thy Tabernacle in this year of our Lord 1955 . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , all right . " " ... bless all who teach and all who learn among the beloved teachers gathered here today that they may train young souls in pursuance of Thy will and grant that in humility of heart . . . " Save us from Communist vegetarian pacifists , " Jeff intoned ,  | " help us build mighty fortresses to ward them off . " He was in a vile mood at that Sunday lunch ; not so much from his headache , Edmundhad deciphered , but from the announcement of another of Pebble 's imminent departures . The day was halcyon . Victoria was running about in a little apron , helping her mother to bring dishes from the kitchen . Still dressed in her bathing suit , Claire had set the table quite formally with the little that remained of Babsie 's silver . In the desolate white dining room ornated with humans agitating for redress , sunlight dappled by the sound gleamed on the same crystal and china as it had precisely twenty years ago . Plinker hoveredover the table , leaning on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very old , his eyes traveling from Jeff to Claire to the photograph of Bertrand Russell over the breakfront. " . . . save us from the savers , " Jeff continued as he set the roast on the table . " Ban the Bomb Banners , enable us to resist the resis-ters " " Mediums , vegetarians , " Plinker muttered . Edmund found Claire 's next tactic quite extraordinary . She proceeded to propound domestic information of the grossest common sense : April 's toilet-training theories were outdated , not a chance of getting her to listen to Dr. Spock , a string quartet from Boston was playing at Town Hall on Wednesday , the mushroom dish she 'd fixed them today came from the Alternative Commune Cookbook and was n't it heaven ? Edmund feared greatly what would come next : confrontation , accusation , the pain of history . " Edmund , you want to be a swell friend to little Victoria ? " Jeff was sharpening his carving knife , flourishing it with theatrical gesturesthat worried Edmund . " Why do n't you stick around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the vegerino meals coming right on sched , bang bang , but when she 's away saving the world it 's up to us men to stave for ourselves . Join the club of the bereaved , Eddem , greater love hath no man than to share his family with his friends , the little he has of it . So here 's the real grub , and is it delish ; Vicky , watch Daddy carve the lovely roast . Thanks for uncorking the wine so nicely , sweet Plinker , I drink a toast to . . . our happiness . Not a chance , let 's try again . To the cun/ping little pacifists who 'll save America ! Do n't knock them E. R. or they 'll creep up on you ! Salut ! Na Zdarovie ! " Edmund felt great anger rising . His childhood craving for china , silver , dining rooms , his lifelong love for the solace of rituals , the polonaise of etiquette . . . they were trampling on the torn garmentsof his youth , whatever there was left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Must this family always be going mad in some way ? Ca n't you pull yourselves together and lead this country again as you always have ? Where 's your stamina , where 's everything ? You ca n't even do a proper Sunday lunch anymore ! " Nantucket , Mass . July 8th , 1965. . . at some point in that meal , Soph , with that haunting view of the sound unchanged since the day the four of us first had lunch together , I found myself in an argument with Claire that went somewhat like this : Your pacifist friends would n't give a rat 's prick about watching the world burn , right , they 'd let someone else do that dirty little business ? . . . Well , you know perfectly well how she 'd retort , she did n't sound that different from the way you would have in one of your earlier incarnations : You desiccated passive academic always locked in your ivory tower she cried , are you saying you believe in violence ? Not at all I replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's a lot of brutality in your nonviolence Santa Clara , you 're being duped by the new manufacturers of liberation , another big business that 's about to boom in this country . . . .  |p207TITIAN  'S Shower of Danae depicts a naked woman reclining on a richly rumpled bed , a wreath of pale braided hair winding between her perfect breasts . Gold , rose , mauve glazes cast on her flesh the luminous grain of time-worn silks , of a camellia on its last days of bloom . One leg is bent at the knee , her head leans back on a pillow as she stares at the shower of golden coins that descends from the sky above her . Her expression is one of rapture , of abandon . Yet the painting is full of doom , russet shower bursting upon Danae from a somber thunderous sky , Godhead manifesting itself not in a beneficent stream but in some awesome explosion . And at the right of the canvas an aging woman servant greedily holds out her arms to catch the falling gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud over the maiden 's sumptuous flesh . Edmund stands before Titian 's Danae on a June morning in Leningrad'sHermitage Museum . Let Dr. Richter write an ideal last paper in which he 'll elaborate on the ambiguous symbolism of this spilt radiance , gold and sperm , greed and grace , man spending his sperm or his hard-earned coins , sky god spending itself in a rain of gold . Previous instances in which an effusion of riches is a sign of grace : shower of coins blessing Hansel and Crete as they fall into their innocent sleep ; Grimm brothers ' Sternhaler , wealth of goldp208raining down upon the pious orphaned virgin who offers all her clothing to the poor ; the young hero of still another German folktalesoars above his city on a giant bee , dispensing golden showers on all the marriageable girls of his province . One could speculate on the roots of such legends in primeval agricultural myths , in the ancient rites which call on male gods to fructify the fields of female earth . Teutonic legends merely Nordic variants on Zeus 's rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Danaewas even seen by some medieval scholars as a prefiguration of the Virgin Mary . And so the cloudburst of coins descending upon Titian 's reclining maiden ( this would be an amusingly farfetched aside of our discourse ) could be compared to the fertilizing beams of grace that flow to Mary from the angel 's palm in paintings of the Annunciation . " Dr. Richter will give his last lecture of the century tonight on The Iconography of the Shower of Gold as a Prefigurationof the Word . ' " One could stress that in earlier depictions of the Danae myth ( Correggio 's , Gentileschi 's ) Danae stretches out her own hand with considerable greed , seems as guilty of cupidity as the elderly attendant hovering by her side . But this is where Titian shows his psychological cunning , transposes all avarice unto the hag who hovers over the rapturous girl , purifies his heroine into a symbol of amorous and celestial grace . . . . Also ! Essential to elaborateright here on the splendid Oedipal elements of the PerseusDanaetale : Danae 's father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be destroyed by his own grandson , imprisoning his only daughter in a brass chamber to preserve her virginity ; sky god 's divine rain piercing through the fortress wall to conceive Perseus , the redeemer king , Perseus later performing heroic feats to protect his mother 's chastity , destroying her tyrannic captors with the head of the Gorgon Medusa whose sight turns men to stone , " Snakehairedcreature fought and won through lurid air on strident , whirlingwings . . . The city of Leningrad glimmers a floor below the windows of the Hermitage ; sharply etched buildings washed with pale hues of confectioners ' colors , familiar from the aquatints hung about Mara 's bed in their tiny New York rooms ; the walls of the General Staff Headquarters across Palace Square are the pale yellow of fresh but/ter . Edmund had looked away from Titian 's Danae for a moment and realized why the image had long mesmerized him : the very tale of his adolescence , fatherless Edmund and chaste much-courted Mara whose marriage led to her destruction . A curiosity about his father 's identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very mild malarial fever . It 's odd that you do n't wonder more about who he was , John Mirsky had once said . Well perhaps he was another salesman of fake degrees from the University of Heidelberg , Edmund answered , like that creep my mother fell for in her blini parlor . Do you realize that you can only joke about it ? John had persisted . . . . Some years ago , shortly before dying , Grisha had finally given Edmund the key to his father 's identity . The first Edmund was a gifted but unsuccessful painter who had killed himself with laudanum out of fear of not making his proper mark upon the world . It was as dreary and simple as that . He had never even been a writer . The epiphany had explained Mara 's long-suffering silences , her awesome nurturing of her son 's gifts , her determination to bring him early fame so as to enjoy its fruits during her own short life . The revelation had strengthened Edmund 's disdain for any form of suicide , existential , too chic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father had just been . . . a shower of sperm , a man spending himself in a shower of golden talent .... Edmund goes on to pace about the ornate gilt-ceilinged galleries of the Hermitage . Earlier that morning Intourist Tour No. 137 had been guided through chambers surfeited with marble surfaces and precious stones , through doors flanked by caryatids and columns of jasper , malachite , lapis lazuli . " Everything in St. Petersburg is colossal , innumerable , ' " Edmund had read to Claire over breakfast from a nineteenth-century traveler 's diary . " ... the costliness and glare of the courtiers ' apparel , and a profusion of precious stones , create a splendour of which the magnificence of other courts can only give us a faint idea . . . many of the nobility are almost covered with diamonds yet the same nobles sleep on the floors of their palaces to avoid the vermin of their beds , have a great part of their estates pledged to pawn shops Impatient to reach the galleries of European painting , Edmundp210had walked restlessly that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alabaster basins , had stood before a twenty-seven-yard-wide map of Russia whose cities and rivers are indicated by rubies and emeralds . The Rolls-Roycers exultover the quantity of gems , the Zabars ask Edmund studious questions about French influences on nineteenth-century Russian art , the Weickers photograph every portrait of royalty in sight . The Americans are particularly elated by Faberge 's eight-foot-high sapphire-studdedgold clock in the form of a peacock which makes a total revolution of its wings upon the striking of each hour . " Once outside nature I shall never take / My bodily form from any natural thing , ' " Sophie whispers to Edmund as she stands in front of the blazing bird . " Once out of nature , ' " Edmund rebuts , she 's still getting it wrong after thirty years ; " give me the next lines , sweetness butsuch a form as Grecian goldsmiths make / Of hammered gold and gold enameling . .. ' " He kisses her forehead and wanders on . The Hermitage contains 1050 rooms 1170 staircases and fourteen miles of floors and galleries , Evgeny calls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guided tour . Edmund goes to stand before a Mernling which he suspects is false , searches for Claire . Standing by a window he sees the gold needle of St. Paul 's Cathedral rising ethereal towards a mother-ofpearlsky , Claire passes him by with her abstracted gaze , flat brown hair hanging straight as a schoolgirl 's ; at times he wishes he could drink her , ingest her so as to know her from the inside of himself . Shreds of their early life return as he comes back to stand before Titian 's Danae , Claire at the Sealark piano playing Fur Elise , sunlightpouring into the room from a gull-filled sky while Sophie trims his hair with Babsie 's gardening shears , Jeff radiant with heroism brings him hot broth every hour , it 's the day after Edmund 's almost drowned and the household has gathered about him and caters to his every whim ; in the next room Plinker growls out orders to his Wall Street firm over the phone . . . another point to make about the image of Danae ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outward sign of inner grace as well of lowliest corruption . The foulness of riches , Midas choking on his fortune , finding death in it . Luther had gone further than anyonep211else in associating wealth with excrement and Satan , " Money is the word of Satan , " " Simia Dei , ape of God . " Gold equals grace also equals defecation . The prophet of Protestantism receives his first illumination in the privy of his monastery at Wittenberg , later envisionsthe Apocalypse , the Second Coming , as a rain of gold that turns to fecal filth . Ambivalence of the most potent symbols , showerof gold that is both sinful offal and symbol of God 's love ! " Gentlemen and ladies , " Irina calls out , " we are now entering the great rooms of Hermitage 's Dutch paintings , collectionbegun by Catherine the Great with help of French philosopherDiderot .. .. " Much greater stress on grace in Rembrandt 's version of The Shower of Danae . The iconography of coinage disappears , Rembrandtdematerializes gold into pure light , transmutes the shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper left of the canvas . The northern Danae does not lie in the erotic pastoral loggiaof Venetian nudes but on the alcoved bed of a proper Dutch interior ; contrast her modesty , her Puritan reticence to the brazen hedonism of her Venetian counterpart . . . the torso of Rembrandt'sfigure is half raised on a folded arm , she greets the effusion of light not with the voluptuous abandon of Titian 's maiden but with the serene , surprised gesture of an Annunciation scene . The cloudburst of radiance pouring down upon her seems to bring happinessto all ; the aging servant at Danae 's side is devoid of the greed of her own Venetian counterpart , stares at the spilt radiance with the obedient awe of a worshiper at Mass . Light ! No ambivalence there , an element of redemption wherever you turn , Australian shamangaining his magic powers by swallowing rock crystals , Augustine , the light Grace pours into our inner eye ... . In the early seventies , trying to ease Claire through her convent phase , Edmund had used the term secular Pelagianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusory , that she could find whatever she wished to call salvation by returning to the palpable political suffering of others . Which she 'd eventually done beyond the call of duty ; such was the nature of the errand they 'd debated a few nights ago and a myriad of her other dedications . In that austerep212period of her sisterhood he 'd told her that grace could lurk on many levels , in the hard decision , the clear memory of a mother , behind every closed door of the courage to be . He had confided to Claire that if he were ever to paint again ( this desire was then just nascent ) he would have to find many new sources of fortitude  --  a new wellspring of trust in himself , a new fund of trust in others , a disdainfulindifference to most criticism , a vastly purified life lived far beyond the pale of that public scrutiny which he had come to think of as demonic . To paint again would require some upwards mobilityof trust , rebecoming as unwary as a small child , shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love and loveliness , believing in the spilt radiance of belief . Edmund begins to walk out of the Hermitage after having mustered the courage to tell his two loves , two Muses , about a curious decision : On this particularly light-flooded morning he will tell them that he 's about to radically change his life again . Sophie will have a fit , he can already hear her , at your level of success , achievement . . . Edmund smiles at the travelers assembledwith him in the Rembrandt gallery and feels a happiness he has n't known for decades . " What 's so new and exciting , E.R. ? " Sophie whispers as she comes towards him . " He 's manic , marvelous this morning "  --  Claire taps his elbow with her notebook  --  " pouring forth pure sunshine . " " Our own dear tyrant , what 's come over him ? " " Are you suddenly happy , Edmund love ? " " Happy ? He 'd need a Nobel . " " A superb new insight to share with your classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving any more classes . Finito , I 'm quitting , I 'm leaving Berkeley . " " When , " Claire says excitedly , " precisely when did you make that perfectly extraordinary decision ? " " Quite some time ago , it 's precisely what I came here to talk to you about . " " You 're totally out of your mind " ( he could have said it forp213Sophie , journalists are so predictable ) , " when anyone 's at the top of their ... " He does n't hear the end of her sentence . He 's spun around and is walking swiftly towards the museum 's exit . He 's placated Evgeny with declarations of urgent bodily needs . He walks through a gallery hung with quattrocento masters he 's dissected for decades of classroomlectures : note the drapery language , the bleak featureless landscape which emphasizes the monumental isolation of the figures . He pauses once with reverence before a Fra Angelico depictingthe Virgin and Child flanked by Saint Dominic and Saint Thomas . The sun is God 's sun and light stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no nature independent from God 's hierarchy . Self-absorption of Angelico 's figures , incorruptibility of their inwardness , saints as well as artists know that loneliness is the centralcondition of their vocation ; how clearly this is stated in their fiercely lowered eyes , the isolation of their gestures . . . He resumes his swift walk towards the Neva , passes through the palace 's barbaric expanses of marble , jasper , malachite , walks by a bronze life mask of Peter the Great  --  eyes dilated as those of a Gorgon , brutal face set upon a monstrously thick neck  --  standing amid the vulgar gilt of caryatids . The artists with whom we 've communedthis morning have achieved most of the goals of heroism and religion , they 've forced us to remain perpetually in their presence , they 've conquered death ; in these rooms the suffering of history is temporarily eased , time the destroyer is imprisoned and held at bay . . . . All of art is one gigantic guerrilla expedition against the chaos of experience and the silence of death .. .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down our rivers ... " The artist works on the faith that he contains in himself the source of his eternity , still engages in that communion with the immortal which is said to have passed away with the waning of the gods . . . . That was one way of putting it , E.R. , not very satisfactory , too much of the old Romantic tripe . Divinity of the creator , artist as sacred vessel  --  bane of our existence ! Debased Faustianism , elitist ooze , Kraut metaphysics doled out in seedy art schools . . .  |p214Try  again , Richter . I want to be more of what I could have been . Edmund walks to the embankment of the Neva and stares at the swiftness of the river 's flow . He climbs down a flight of stairs , stands a foot above its eddies . The Neva swirls in tortuous currents from some icy lake many miles east of the city , flowing senselessly to lose itself in the glacial waters of the Gulf of Finland . Edmund opens his trousers and relieves himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankment , descends into the innards of Russia 's most brutal river . Edmund spends himself graciously into the pool of his unknown forefathers , he sheds years of pain as he flows into their victories , their passions , their unknown sins . He watches his arabesque for a felicity of time and when it subdues he feels great loss , great regret , that such moments of joy can not last for an eternity . His bliss flies above him in a dazzling troika , a flock of swans echo his delight on the black water , the Sphinx of Russia laughs all about him with bared fangs , all noise ceases on the Neva ; the corrupt world waits for its absolution , tail lowered , like a guilty dog , all sleeps for a while  --  humans , palaces , canals  --  and then bells begin to ring again over the city 's golden fleece . Edmund turns back towards the green-and-gold immensity of the Winter Palace , stares at the great bronze statues that stand atop the ice-green roof . Their arms are raised in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still for a few moments until he sees his friends flowing through the portals of the Hermitage . Flanked by the chattering Zabars and the photographing Weickers , Sophie and Claire walk slowly onto the quay of the Neva , their arms about each other 's waists . " Freedom , svoboda ! " he says as he hastens towards them . " Dear God " ( he also knew something similar would come out of Sophie ) , " what a country he 's chosen to find that in. "  |p215HE  heard Spanish being spoken , toilets flushing , dogs barking somewhere next door . Sophie was wearing a turban . A large parrot hovered over Edmund , staring out of a mean yellow eye . This was New York ? A man sat by the window , smiling , peelingcarrots . Sophie had lined up seven large canvases against the wall by the fireplace , they were her paintings , damn it ; here he was impotent before his life 's passion and she was dabbling away with excruciating freedom , even with a measure of talent . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He already had a headache . Edmund leaned back against the pillow on Sophie 's bed and inhaled his joint . Sophie seemed to have divorced and remarried and was wearing a turban . He also saw organic cookbooks , amaryllis plants in various stages of phallic splendor , effusions of batik , a tyranny of mirrors , pillows and tatami mats strewn about the floor . All was precisely as it should be . Claire was serving a two-week term for civil disobediencein some D.C. jail and Sophie was shacked up with a bodyfreakOff-Broadway star who was peeling carrots of bright cadmium orange . Two months ago she 'd notified him that her radio program , Tell It Like It Is , was being syndicated to thirty-seven stations and that she 'd started going to the Art Students League at nights . Americawas going mad . This generation thought it could master , domesticateeverything . The mirrors lining Sophie 's living room re/flected myriad areas of the parrot 's plumage , shimmering panels of cobalt , alizarin , chrome yellow . It was 1969 . Why was he lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of feminist rhetoric he 'd heard on Sophie 's program all the way to Berkeley . " Someday I also want to write a novel which expresses sexual experience from an intensely female point of view , " she was saying . " Mailer and Henry Miller piss me off ; I mean how do they know what it 's like for a woman to have her first orgasm or suck a man 's cock ? " " If you ca n't talk like a lady at least talk like a gentleman , " Edmund muttered . The actor wore a gold chain with a small squat Buddha around his neck . He had dark glasses and long wavy brown hair and a Chagall-bluejacket with gold braid on it , like the prince 's in Swan Lake . The actor was quite famous . Edmund had seen pictures of him in a half-dozen publications in the past year alone . He 'd seen him in The Village Voice doing a Cherry Orchard in modern dress , playing the schoolteacher in SDS costume . He 'd read about his performance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an environment of red silk . Sophie finally had an artist of her own again ! And in the corner of the room stood her new easel , surrounded by dozens of fresh lustrous canvases . She smiled at Edmundradiantly , hair more Titian-sumptuous than ever . Her breasts hung splendid and braless under a T-shirt which said Liberate the Presidio Seven , her hips were swathed in a lamentation of African cotton . She stretched her arm up rhythmically , as if practicing one of her old dance exercises ; dark soft hair stood like a small forest in the snowfield of her underarms , her ancient floral odor wafted towardshim with the precision of new lilacs . Come away with me he wanted to say , erotic sister , beloved companion of my happiest days , come away ! Shared studios of our youth , plaster casts , the paisley shawls we 'd draped under vases of fresh roses . . . She stretched her arm still higher ; her perfume pulsated towards him along with the torturing smell of his abandoned oil paints . " Well what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . " He inhaled , deeply this time . " Watch your edges . "  |p217He  was a donkey , flying through the room , braying . The actor 's shoulders had grown a tender hue of crimson as carrots mounted in his bowl . Today , today ! the parrot screamed . Edmund finished his joint and leaned back on the bed , peacefully looking at Sophie 's canvases . All was spherical , orbed , drawn with remarkable precisionand executed in excruciatingly fleshly hues , sometimes dimpledwith what seemed to be a proliferation of nipples . Abundance of genital shapes , dark chasms surrounded by delicate labial convolutions , crimson clefts , violet orifices , botanical curiosities honeycombedwith the fluting and thrumming of biological tissue . " You 're sure painting with your ovaries on your sleeve . Powerful sense of design . Are you two planning marriage ? " Edmund feigned a yawn . " Institutionalize the rape and bondage of women ? " " Legal whoredom ! " " So . No nuptial benediction , " Edmund murmured , relieved . Edmund squinted at the paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . Rosa Luxemburg , Let It All Hang Out , Homage to Eleanor of Aquitaine . Cathedrals of convoluted tissue , femaleness offered as some primeval covenant . Serrated , revolutionarylabia bulging with assertive tendrils ( George Sand ) . Shy pearly labia nestled in collars of elaborately drawn lace ( Homage to Emily Dickinson ) . Fleshly labia palpitating around assertive central slits ( Charlotte Corday ) . She said : " You 're threatened , are n't you ? " " Uhh ... why ? " " Let 's be existential , Edmund , one of the reasons you 're so threatened by my imagery is that women have an infinite capacity for orgasm . " " Uhuhhh . " " Uhh , uhuhhh , a new academic tic of yours . Not only can we have eighteen orgasms in a row , honeybun , we can also fake them . " " Really . Good luck , my precious darling .

" " Today ! Today ! " the parrot screamed . " The problem of avoiding emotional strain can only be cured by the praxis of nutrition , " the actor was saying . " I see in you the fatigue , the banal metaphysical fatigue of a man still striving to find himself . . . it can be allayed by daily intakes of lecithin in normative doses , and you 'd better check on your glycogens . . . They had sat down to dinner. . .. glycogens are the existential component of our biological spectrum , they tune , they vivify , they turn the body of despair into the hope of the future . . . . The American diet elevates innocent stupidity to a form of suicide , pure Thanatos at six P.M. across the fifty-two states " You could only have found him in California , " Edmund muttered to Sophie when his host went to the kitchen for the next course .

My closet is my haven , my most precious refuge , my repressions are truly collector 's items ! You 've become infectedwith the cult of openness , sweetheart , that diet of absolute candor you feed me on your program and off it is ruining the culture as fast as anything else . . .. " The first phase of grass always made him talk very quickly , he packed his words in as fast as he could in apprehension of the torpor that followed .

Whether she picked up a hi-fi repairman or shared a bacchanalwith a triad of stoned sociologists she described her encounters with the sordid detail of a botanist 's journal . . . . I threatened to leave her ; since she did n't have the imagination to lie I begged her to deceive me , that 's how tedious these unsolicited accounts became . . . . I insulted her , I told her that I did n't ask of a lover to be faithful but simply to remain interesting  --  all to no avail ; for a year I lived folie deux with this voluptuary of the sincere . . . .

Sophie and her man hold up their bowls with both hands and make a small bow of the head to each other at the beginning of each course . Edmund asks which ashram they 've picked that up in but by that time everyone 's having trouble hearing each other . Miles Davis is on full blast . There 's been much wine . The grass is catching up with Edmund . " Listen to those drums ! " the actor says to Sophie . She raises her eyes to the ceiling with a knowing smile . " It must be like this every night , " Edmund says ; " is it like this every night ?

Edmund went back to the Westbury Hotel and started assembling every lamp he could find in his suite . Then he surrounded his bed with them .

Mara gurgles and trills back to them in their own tongue , the most resplendent and desirable feathers lie on the ceilingso Mara grabs his hand and they fly through the width and height of the room , smoothing their palms over the wings of many a silken bird , hovering at length to caress the gleaming plumages , they swoop from swansdown to shimmering egrets to bronzed guineahen . . . .

When Edmund wanted to attend an Office during his visits to Claire he came in well before the appointed time , loving the mystery of the space at its most tenebrous , before any candles were lit . Shortly after she 'd entered the monastery he 'd gone to hear None , the Office preceding the nuns ' afternoon work period . A thin white curtain had remained drawn across the wooden choir screen of the chapel , fluttering in the summer breeze like a moth 's wing . And from behind it there emerged the frailest , most ethereal chant imaginable , the nuns singingthe Alleluia of midday on a single spectral note , perhaps high E . . . the timbre of their voices was supplicating and expressed a certain helplessness . . . the single tone of their litany floated wraithlike above the sounds of nature proliferating outside the small chapel , blackbird proffering its liquid trill , guard dog barking . . . The pale incantation lasted for ten minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dark , a band of women in dusty gray work robes and muddy boots streamed out of the chapel and went out again towards their fields , their sheds , their kitchens , to continue their task of survival . . . . Claire had told him that her favorite Office was the Matins sung between the hours of 4:00 to 6:oo A.M. , which was exclusively dedicated to the singing of thep224Psalms . Once in a rare moment of insomnia Edmund rose at four to hear Matins and was perplexed by the thought that throughout the world tens of thousands of his contemporaries were still dedicating over five hours a day to chanting sacred litanies  --  Matins , Lauds , Mass , Sexts , None , Vespers , Compline  --  " simply singing in celebration of the ground of being , " that was the way Pebble had put it . . . perhaps if he let himself go and thought of sacred life as simple celebration , thought of the Lord as a great Will diverting Himself in the garden of His creation , the meaning of her present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and time could be the dance of the Lord in emptiness , and the silence of the spheres the music of a wedding feast . . . there is a painting of Zurbaran 's which reminded him of Claire when he stared at her standing at the back of the chapel , one of three lay sisters coiffed in a simple veil , her beauty more impassive , more imperturbable than ever , the perfectoval of her face , the slightly arrogant mouth . . . it was in this state of stubborn self-determination that she had realized her fullest and most complete womanhood . . . on another occasion some sly beckoning of her eyes led him to go up to the altar at communion time with the handful of worshipers from the nearby village who came to daily Mass . . . he walked up to the altar and closed his eyes , remembering the icy ting of the Communion spoon on his lip in the Orthodox church , in the Eucharists he 'd shared with his mother . . . now the wafer lay tasteless and fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing and went back to his pew . In the tempest of opinions and regrets that followedClaire 's exit from the secular world ( " Folie mystique ! " exclaimedCousin April , who had left her second husband and taken a string of courses at the Alliance Francaise ) , the central trait of Claire 's character was curiously overlooked . Except for Edmund , no one took into account her excessive will to autonomy , her lifelongstruggle to liberate herself totally from the privileged world she 'd been born into . History 's made it clear , Edmund would say , that most persons striving for sainthood or the monastic life are endowed with a perfectly remarkable will to power ; why else dop225they so frequently pray for humility ? Yet even Edmund admitted that the timing of this decision was extremely singular . Throughout the 196os thousands of men and women had been leaving the traditionalreligious life to work for precisely the same secular causes that had been obsessing Claire . Nuns who 'd been forbidden to read anything beyond the collection of saints ' lives on their convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of praying and attending weekend seminars on revolution . Benedictineswho had written on the contemplative life for arcane theologicaljournals were protesting the Vietnam War with acts of civil disobedience and singing hymns over piles of burning draft files . It is in February of 1971 , at the height of this rebellion against all traditional premises of salvation , six months or so after her father 's death , that Claire went to live as a lay sister at the Abbey of St. Agatha , a community of cloistered Anglican nuns in eastern Minnesota . For several preceding years she has engaged in a ritual that has already caused much consternation to her family : Claire Sanford Howell , progeny of all that 's most decorous in American society , has been repeatedly dragged away by policemen in antiwar demonstrations . There is a core of austerity in her that adapts with an assentment almost perverse to the rigors of prison life . By 1970 she 's been arrested twelve , fourteen times . She comes into a cell , takes off her shoes and sits cross-legged on the prison floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze of absolution as she observes the cold animal rage of women 's eyes clutching the bars of their cells , the pistols slung on the hips of jail matrons patrolling the corridors , the graffiiti on cell walls saying ARISE AND SHINE YE SISTERS OF THEWORLD . In the late sixties Claire had engaged in civil disobedience with a nun who convinced her that " in witness to the poor " they should refuse bail and choose instead the alternate penance of five days ' imprisonment . She henceforth refused bail at all her arrests and deepened that sacrifice with a water fast . ( Edmund gently scolded her , in a note from Berkeley , for " indulging in that greed for personal salvation which might be the most obnoxious greed there is. " )  |p226With  questionable precision , psychologists have tended to divide humanity into the healthy souls who are content to be born just once and those problematic " twice-born " spirits driven to search for redeeming conversion . One of the intricacies of Claire Sanford 's character is that she does n't belong clearly to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebirth " in her decision to leave the secular world . She 's never entertained , for instance , the fashionable Anglican custom of turning to Roman Catholicism . To the contrary ( as she enjoys stressing in her letters ) she 's being more faithful than ever to " the rock bottom of our own tradition . " Her decision seems to be forged in that iron of the soul which drives most reformers and revolutionaries to return to earlier levels of purityand rigor . In the months preceding her departure for the convent , for instance , Claire spent much time reading medieval history , concentrating in particular on the great abbesses of the early Middle Ages . This obsession had also been instigated by one of the many priests and nuns she worked with in the antiwar movement  --  a Franciscan who lectured spiritedly , during an all-night vigil at the Pentagon , on " Women 's Autonomy in the Religious Orders . " And if Claire ever came close to a state of trance it might have consisted of some historical meditation on these paragons of female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabled for stilling storms and taming wild beasts , founders and administratorsof great separatist enclaves , females so powerful that they did n't allow bishops into their monastic settlements ! Saint Melania , converter of Byzantine emperors , Saints Thecla and Lioba , girls of noble birth who left their families to escape unwanted marriages and ended their lives as contemplatives in mountain retreats where they healed and taught the hundreds who came to them . Women saying no to the dictates of family , leaving marriages that enslaved them to the cycle of childbearing , pioneering enclaves of peace and learning in the chaos of barbaric forests , defying the patriarchal order , creating the truest semblance of equality offered women in the West . What transcendence , what a release from the tyranny of nature , Claire would write in one of her letters to Sophie ! What ap227splendid improvement on our pathetic new concepts of women 's liberation ! " I never did like the Reformation , " she wrote in her P.S. " What an erosion of our autonomy , what a blow to women 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in 1971 she 'd pack a small bag of personal effects and leave her home in Concord with a long letter to Jeff ( two impeccable carbon copies had already been mailed to Edmund and Sophie ) announcing her decision to go and live , for an indeterminateamount of time , at the Abbey of St. Agatha in Four Rivers , Minnesota . There were two separate letters for her twelve-year-old daughter Victoria : one to be opened before her departure , another one a year hence . She did n't claim to have heard any voices , sensed Presences , experiencedtransports . Her departure for Minnesota seemed as calm and measured as the little notes she 'd written to herself since childhood , those neatly labeled exhortations towards self-perfection scatteredamong the pages of her Book of Common Prayer and her cages of recuperating animals . The first visit Edmund made to St. Agatha 's occurredsome three months after Claire 's departure , and was preceded by several communications concerning the behavior expected of him at the abbey guesthouse , where relatives and friends of the nuns were allowed to come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge is open to visitors for only a few hours of the afternoon , and for good or for worse that 's where we 'll have to meet . I asked the mother superior for visit permission a few weeks ago and it 's been granted . .. . " " Your essay on Van Der Weyden 's Deposition sounds like an ideal project to work on here , and if I told you not to bring your darn typewriter I 'd feel as if I were ordering Kenneth Clark not to write . So yes do bring it , but only use it in your room with the doors closed so as not to distract other guests who seek the meditative silence we promise them . . . . "  |p228The  abbey was set in heavily wooded Minnesota terrain , several hours from the nearest large town . And the guesthousewhere Edmund came to stay for his visits with Claire was situated at the bottom of a steep hill a half mile or so from the abbey proper . The rustic dirt road wound upwards through several stands of pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . The abbey church loomed before the visitor at a sudden turn of the road when one least expected it , its small gilded cross outlineddarkly against the setting sun . Edmund had arrived on a halcyonevening in late May for his first visit , feeling great need to look at the landscape which Claire was confined to seeing day after day . In an expanse of valley within the monastic enclosure he glimpsed well-tilled fields of corn and wheat , thriving vegetable gardens and fruit orchards , pastures dotted with Hereford cows . A frail , high strain of women 's voices emerged from the chapel , they must have been singing Compline , the last office of the day . Mallows , day lilies , buttercups , blazed in the small field at his side . On a summer evening like this twenty-two years ago he had kissed Claire for the first time and felt her resistance , that mineral resistance to the expected which was the core of her being . A beaver shuttled swiftly , silently across a nearby pond , carrying formidable amounts of twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligentabove the umbrous water . He dove repeatedly to prepare the terrain of his habitation , floated several large balls of mud across the pond to heap them upon his dam , his paws often scrubbing his face as if to sanctify it for a new bout of work . It appeared to be the first sunny evening after a stretch of rain , the air was filled with the fervid buzzing , gathering , soaring of spring insects . Edmund picked a few wild flowers to take to his stark room in the guesthouse . Before walking downhill he stared once more at the serene enclosurein which Claire had chosen to continue her struggle for selfperfection . In this tiny community as closed and self-sufficient as the beavers ' pond nearby , what a challenge it was to curb one 's drives of greed , envy , pride ! Before going to sleep he started a letter to Sophie , who the year before had begun a vigorous new career as television correspon/dent . She was presently on a long-term assignment in Jerusalem , where she was living with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sat down to write , free to metamorphose until the end of their days . . . ( he always strived for a dramatic opening when writing to Sophie . ) Polymorphic creaturestackling vows of chastity at forty , struggling with doctorates in sociobiology at fifty-six , dropping their first acid at sixty-two like Mrs. Tillich . .. . " O brave new world , " he continued his letter , " that is seeing the Odysseizing of women , the Penelopizing of men . " " It was in November or so of 1970 , Eddem . . . I was standing with some nuns and priests in a small room in a black section of Boston ; we were having a Eucharist in preparation for an action on the nearby draft board . . . . The room we stood in faced a black tenement , a backyard full of boards , rags , trash , debris , buildings that looked as if they 'd been struck by a series of bombings . . . it all had a quality of occupied territory , as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Only one room in the tenement looked lived in , and at its window sat a woman hugely swollen with some disease who fanned herself with a newspaper and held a wasted , screaming child on her lap . . . . The Epistle reading that day had been from Corinthians Two : I 've been in danger in the towns , in danger in the open country , in danger at sea , in danger from so-called brothers . . . ' And as I began to think about these lines everything in my field of vision suddenly took on a curious and intense existence of its own . That is . . . everything suddenly appeared to have an immense interior space , to own an individual life as precious as the whole universe . To save that womanand child , to go out to them and not only feed them and get them work but particularly to give them the courage to live on seemed as important and quite as difficult as stopping any war . . . . Eddem , this was n't a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had moved towards him an hour ago across the parlor of the abbey lodge with a merry , rolling gait . And he was both startled and perplexed to see that she 'd never looked so well . Her cheeks had gained a startling new ruddiness . She had even plumped out a littlep230bit . ( " Hi , cookie , " he 'd said when they 'd embraced . What does one say ? He had n't known precisely what to say . " You 're looking so marvelous ! What a marvelous place ! " ) Her erect posture , her crisp walk , had something newly determined about it . Dressed in a surprisinglycontemporary long gown of brown serge , a lay sister 's simplewhite veil floating about her head , there was his Pebble walking towards him with a radiant smile ... . " I do want to stress the difference , Edmund ; in that moment in which I seemed to make my choice there was none of that sense of unity or merging mystics report , none of that business of All Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything stood out with a fierce and glowing individuality . And E.R. you know how much guilt I 've been burdened with for years , guilt for the very fact of surviving and being blessed with much ; perhaps that 's why I did n't even feel worthy of the happiness I could have had with you . . . well , in the surrendering I experienced that day , the guilt was . . . as if melted , melted . Burden of condemnation gone , darknesslifted . " " But , Pebble . . . allow me an indiscretion . You had no vision ? You do n't call that a vision ? " " No , it was rather . . . an abandonment and a return . At that moment in the bleak room I stood in , the stillness was marvelous , and I felt both . . . both deeply anguished by our helplessness , and supremely happy because I was accepting that helplessness . There was very little theology you know in this moment of mine . Simply a willingness to capitulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but . . . that 's too private to talk about . A passion of acquiescence . " There was a bright new caroling quality to her voice , she spoke with the oddly emphatic phrasing he remembered from her adolescence . " You are peaceful , " he whispered . " I looked around at the men and women praying with me that morning and was filled with fear for . . . oh , this is hard to explain , Eddem . " " Do n't always go so fast , Peb . We 've plenty of time , you know . "  | " Well not so much , only until Vespers . . . . Looking at them I was filled with emotion not so much for what they were at that precise moment , more for where they 'd come from . Here they were preparing another of their amazing acts of protest , more courageous and self-giving than anything that 's been done in the Movement . . . I 'd always sensed that it was the meditation and witness they 'd lived for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I had a great fear that their contemplative force was waning , shedding its power like a battery , that the world 's ordinariness was contaminating them too much .... " There was a silence . He found it hard to talk to her because he 'd very quickly sensed that she was still celebrating her isolation , that she was apprehensive about talking about her child and that this must be saved for the last ; he 'd sensed a lot . He cleared his throat as he tended to do in the middle of a college lecture , looked out of the window . Claire flung back the flat brown hair that hung under her veil , a defiant gesture unchanged since childhood . " Oh you 're still puzzling , " she cried out , " you 're still wondering , confused about me , are n't you . . . all right , this is it , Eddem . The reality of my need for the sacred suddenly became greater than my need for any proof of its existence . And so I needed to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such force that he was compelled to look deep into her eyes for the first time since the beginning of that visit . The pale eyes had changed greatly , he could n't tell how at first . Lost their anger , he decided now . On the wall of the abbey lodge behind her chair were affixed the same stark little directives that confronted him daily in the guesthouse : WE WELCOME YOU TO THEABBEY AND ASSURE YOU OF OUR PRAYERS . . . SHORTS ARE NOT PERMITTEDON THE GROUNDS OF THE MONASTERY . . . ST . AGATHA 'S SERVES THOSE SEEKING MEDITATIVE SILENCE . " I knew that I had to take a radical new direction in life , and this in the space of barely a few minutes , Eddem ... . " Like in Somerset Maugham , " he suggested . She waved her hand impatiently , stood up and paced the room . " Hardly as colorful . You 're probably trying to define my experience , darn it , everyone out there is always trying to define every/thing . No , I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chance , my last possible chance of acquiring peace and strength . The universe remained as meaningless as before and even more hopelessly charged with suffering , yet more charged also with some sacred fullness . . . above all it occurred to me that all could be right if I stopped trying to do it all by myself , if I finally ceased to resist and subjected my will to a greater one . ... " " Ouf , that was hard , " she whispered , " that decision to surren-der . " " You of all people . " " Oh it was a struggle . " At night during his many visits to St. Agatha 's , Edmund read from the pious biographies that studded the guesthouse'sbookshelves . He always brought his own work with him but was curiously unable to proceed with it , as if Claire had not yet clarified some aspect of her presence here which he must still persevereto decipher . During those study hours in the evening he kept coming across curious relics of the pietistic 1930s and 194os , accountsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Lisieux by Clare Boothe Luce . ( " Preciousness of every hidden soul in the economy of the universe . . . law of conservation of charity as the center of the comtemplative life . . . . " ) He would bring Claire tidbits of his reading during their afternoon visits , as if to reassure her that he was taking a small step into her world . " I read the most marvelous story about Elizabeth of Hungary last night . " " Tell . " " This sainted queen had for confessor a tyrant , which I would define as a man without imagination . He was perceptive enough , however , to discern that the penances imposed upon Elizabeth in the confessional brought her into a state of joyful exultation . . . . So he searched and searched his mind every Friday afternoon for penances which might bring her a proper dose of pain . He finally came up with a real zinger , he forbade her to help the sick and the poor . But this is where she parted with him and with thep233system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went right on helping the sick and the poor .. . . " Claire leaned forward intently towards him ; she observed him during those visits with a depth of concern she 'd never given him before . " I think you should travel more , dear one , go to Europe ; I feel you 're in a rut after fifteen years of Berkeley . " " You 've turned psychic in your seclusion . But let me finish with Elizabeth . Another order of nature takes over . . . a snowstorm screens her as she makes her nightly trip to the sick and the poor so that her disobedience may not be observed . " The story may exemplify , " he added pointedly , " tyrants ' excessivezeal against all forms of satisfaction . " There were many days when she 'd meet him in the abbey lodge after having come straight in from working in the fields , hair tousled , dust in her face , nails still dark with mud , eyes more serene than ever . Her peevishness , her old resentment towards her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , clear-skinned women walking about the monastery compoundin sneakers and farmers ' boots , their long gray garbs cinched with thick workmen 's belts of heavy leather . Some had come from their beehives , others from their vineyards or cornfields Claire said , they carded their own wool , wove their own cloth . She often pointed out some nun 's name as they said good-bye at the abbey lodge door , that 's Sister Patrick , there 's Sister Stephen , Sister Jerome . " I find them infinitely seductive , " he once wrote Sophie , " like everything that 's veiled . " " Sophie 's gone through another metamorphosis , " Claire announced one day . " Dear Lord , not in a kibbutz . " " Oh it 's for the best Eddem , just listen . . . " Whenever she had a new letter from Sophie she 'd welcome him in the abbey lodge with a joyous wave and immediately begin to read it aloud , quite admitting to her craving for news.  | " Let 's say I 'll just talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three wars in ten years " Sophie wrote . " Like most men in this garrison state Amos 's green eyes have a very controlled anxiety , they 're the eyes of a man who 's had to be both a soldier and a monk , whose body has been struck or grazed by shellfire many times since the War of Independence , and they 're still not as disturbing or disturbedas the eyes of those who live in the northern kibbutzim under a constant barrage of fire . . . . Last week for instance Amos and I drove north to document some articles on the Lebanese border and I 'm still obsessed by the resigned , beaten-down gaze of the twentyfive-year-oldsto whom a machine gun has become a fifth limb .... " Claire paced the room while reading , interrupting to open the window with a brusque gesture . " I ca n't forget that moment last week when we walked into the dining room of a settlement two miles from the Northern border and Amos tapped the shoulder of a young man sitting alone at the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little expressed pleasure , so little recognition in that gaze that I assumed he was barely acquainted with Amos . . . the young Israeli just continued to silentlyeat his soup , staring at us with those exhausted aloof eyes , yet a moment later I learned that he was one of Amos 's most ardent fans , the one who constantly writes and phones to invite Amos to this kibbutz . . . . When Amos started to question him about the rocket attacksof last week his friend 's eyes lost some of their weariness , grew almost angry as he barked back , How do you expect me to remember last week 's shelling from the one before , or from the year before that ? " Well how else can I put it Claire darling , there 's little talk about anything but the possibility of survival in this new Sparta , one only lives for whatever work and love one has , all 's very austere and meaningful . . . at first I was confused and overwhelmed by this state ofp235siege but recently it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face up to the brevity of life , focus on a single task . . . . " " What a miracle , Eddem , " Claire exclaimed , " and what a serious writer she 's getting to be ! " " If she survives it she 'll finally start having the glory she 's always dreamed of . " " No , no , totally different from the passive man-given success she 'd wanted as a kid , this glory will be her own ! " It struck Edmund as interesting that Claire 's seclusion led her to observe others more attentively than ever . " Tell me this , " he began another day ( her costume , the room , sometimes imposed an uncomfortable formality upon him ) . " Are you planning .. . " ( the question was irrelevant at that precisemoment but his need to ask it was immense , a fear as ancient as his love swept through him ) " are you planning to take vows ? " " Oh , no great need ! I 'm not good enough for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , participate in their witness . They 're the rock . I 'm just . . . " She searched for the image . " I 'm just a barnacle . " The humility of the reply affected him . He turned towards the window , stared at the amber pond where he often sat in the evening watching the family of beavers at their work . She would sometimes break off their talks , at the appointed time before evening Vespers , with a terse , pithy phrase : " Sin is just a messing up of your priorities . " That child , that daughter of hers ! Once or twice a year , whenever his work brought him to New England , Edmund made a point of taking Victoria out to tea . She was as pensive as ever but had grown sturdier , was not as fragile of body as Claire had been . Her large eyes were as cold blue pale as her mother 's . The ephemeral touch of her adolescent cheek upon his when they met ,  |p236the  nascent rebelliousness of her talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are people who do n't care about discussing matters such as good and evil , Victoria 'd once said , and they truly bore me to death . Like who for instance darling ? My aunts and cousins of course , all they do is win tennis tournaments and give themselves airs going out to look for persons of the oppositesex , which is so gross . You might belong to a new generation of mystical celibates , Edmund said , a grand solution to the population problem . You know perfectly well that many people get along withoutall that nonsense , Uncle Edmund ; my generation is strictly into friendship , anyway . . . . Uncle Eddem , do you still believe in romanticlove ? she 'd asked him warily from behind her curtain of light brown hair . Oh I 've pretended not to darling he 'd said fiercely , you see I 've had rather little of it . The funny thing , he often thought when he came to the convent , is that Claire 's never been so available to me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net posed over an insect . During the days he spent at St. Agatha 's he experienced the delight of the lepidopterist who triumphs after years of searching for an arcane species and can stare tranquilly at his prize for hours , admiring in loving closeness every detail of mandiblesand rainbow scales . Yet he knew that his love was bound to be all the more arduous because its object seemed to grow more perfect under his close scrutiny . She reversed that habitual process of human passion which wanes with the melting of distance and of dream ; in her new peace and candor she was becoming , to his sorrow , increasingly marvelous . Is there something peculiar about the persons who love only once in their lifetime , he also worried , are the once-in-loves as singular as the twice-born ? Is it a glandular condition , could it be dictated by early deprivation of the mother 's presence ( Freud , Leonardo 's lovelessness ) , is there only one human Muse for each artist 's life ? Are such persons more prone to depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they better or worse athletes ? He imagined people in his part of Californiaforming consciousness-raising groups for the once-in-loves , asso/ciations as garrulously introspective as those for the drug-deprived , the homosexual , the adopted . " It also happened to me in a jail cell , Peb . . . a locale which you barely associate with my decorous right-wing behavior . But I 'm more radical than you think I am , my love . If I had n't become much of an activist it 's because I 'm much more of a cynic than you are ; the antiwar movement had always reminded me of doctors putting Band-Aids on a cancer that needs radical surgery ; I 've come to think that the whole culture has to be rebuilt from the basement up , priorities revolutionized , massive humanistic socialismestablished if such a thing exists . . . . Anyhow , I was hanging around a demonstration trying to keep my dear Slavic friend John Mirsky from getting busted for the tenth time and they rounded up the whole lot of us and I got dragged away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains of one of those detestable hymns that have their proper place in church . . .. I 'd been finding little meaning in anything that year , a medal at the College Art Association for my book on Caravaggio , honorary degrees from Brown and Vanderbilt , letters of corroboration or protest with flattering frequency from the readers of my articles . . . I could accept honor after little honorand feel numb , indifferent , blah ; I 'd turned down visiting professorshipsat Harvard and Chicago because the only reason I 'd have moved would have been to be nearer you or Soph but you were both so nomadic there was no hope of ever catching you anyway ; I could see no alternative to continued steeping in the poisoned juices of Academe . . . until the day I sit in a jail cell staring at a graffito that says what do we want freedom what do we get bologna sandwiches . A tall blond page boy out of Botticelli walks in and lies down on the bunk opposite mine and starts berating me for not signing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . . . he 'd started in art history and had switched to pol sci because it was more relevant ' quote unquote and I dug into him for that . . . the memory is dim now because I was so extraordinarilytaken with Toby 's presence . Oh I 'd had several decorative persons in my life in the past decade as you know , average fare for ap238department chairman , pert grade-grabbing sophomores wanting to squeeze me dry of every inspired thought on Degas , divorcee potterswith a proclivity for interminable foreplay . . . it had been pleasant , it had been lonely in turn . And suddenly here is a Botticellifacing me in a cell , holding a copy of Regis Debray in hand . ... " " And you had Pater ? " " Close , Peb , close . Ruskin . An idiotic ideological argument ensued , what 's appropriate reading in these times of crisis and so forth , Toby was clearly baiting me ; you 're sitting back and letting society rot Professor while mouthing inanities about the stones of Venice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soapbox , and suddenly leaned down to seize the book from my hand . As that pale rather beautiful hand traveled towards me I put my mouth to it and bit him , as satisfying as planting my teeth into a peach in a moment of hunger on a hot day . . . thinking as I did , what barbarians these times have made of us . There was the taste of blood on my tongue , and in his eyes an air of startlement that verged on amusement , pleasure even . Those eyes were a curiously dark brown , like water at night , so dark that you could n't distinguish the iris from the pupil , which would make his periods of drug ingestion maddeningly difficult to deal with in the next months we were to spend together . . . a time devoted of course to reforming his character in my perennial Pygmalion fashion . Oh how readily he turned from the rigors of his Trotskyite student cell to the sybaritic pleasures of my little Pouilly-Fuisses while retaining the luxury of his Marxist rhetoric ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I do , they want the revolution and the palazzo ; you 'll do well in Italy , Toby , I told him the week he left , you 'll get taken to cell meetings in chauffeured Alfa Romeos , Rolls-Royce radicals of the world unite . . . . Of course there were the sweet good moments too that would flood me with regrets for months after we quit , so much that was malleable , splendid about him ; much occasional sweetness , and that long slender body wandering naked about my house with the insouciance which it 's been the genius and the depravity of this generation to cultivate ; the moments when I staredp239at his face below mine , as into the mirror of my own lost youth .... " " But we 're babies , Edmund ! You keep talking as if we 're so ancient ! I feel I 'm at the very beginning of the best life I 'll ever have ! " " That may be an agreeable asset of being one of the twice-born , my dear ; as for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless me sister if I have sinned , just a recent installmentfrom the epic of my tragic flaws . " " I 've told you before , E.R. , I think you need a change , " she whispered . How soothing , after all these years , to have her advise him ! In 1973 Edmund would accept a visiting professorship to a New Englandcollege , having carefully determined that Minnesota was equidistant from California and Massachusetts . " How is she ? " Claire had whispered towards afternoon'send during the very first visit he 'd made to St. Agatha 's . Her face had tightened with pain . A vast expanse of her new armor ( faith , serene obedience ) was shed in that moment . " Victoria 's unbelievable , " he said . " Demonically independent , like you . " He was trying to pace his visits to alternate with Victoria 's , who came every three months or so . He always tried to add a new fillip of information . " She 's doing particularly superb work in Latin this term . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin ! Right up the old family tree . . .

Otherwise I could n't possibly be here . " " Do n't rationalize , " Edmund said severely . Her eyes cast down , undecipherable . " She 's beginning to look at boarding schools , " Edmund continued . " She 's drawn to Milton , and lately to St. Paul 's , of course . . . you might have heard that they 're taking in girls beginningnext year , going co-ed. "  |p240Her  eyes fluttered briefly in merriment . " Oh I wonder how Plinker would have felt about that desecration . " " Are you absolutely sure she 's very well ?

Her " crackerjack plan for salvation , " as you call it , does seem to be a tough , old-fashioned way out of modern quandaries , but I beg you to honor her decision ( if only in the spirit of history ) as one of the more imaginativealternatives a liberated woman can find in our time . . . . You keep falling into the dangerous trap of labeling it " self-abnegation . " In our present tornado of carnal propaganda we seem to forget that celibacy is not necessarily a form of self-denial , that it 's equally served throughout history to enlarge our secular powers and achieve the full potency of our selfhood , that it 's been as much practiced by the tribesman readying himself for the big hunt or the warrior preparing for an important battle as by the shaman , priest or hermit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as you so cutely phrase it , is by far the most radical act of independence she could engage in . You forget how devilishlyconsistent she is , dear fellow ; only the devil is more consistent than she is . . . . Jeff ! In the recent past when Edmund stood in an airport on the way to one of his conferences he had seen Jeff waiting for a plane , waiting for a woman . . . . Jeff kept his hands in his pockets as he smilingly waited , as if nervously fingering handfuls of loose change . . . the trousers of his perennial Brooks Brothers tweeds were cut on the short side , in the manner of the 1940s , and underneaththeir cuffs there stretched an area of immaculate athleticp241sock . . . . Faint gray now streaked that excellent head of shortclippedhair and gave him an added air of venerability . . . . Jeff the ever-ready groom , Jeff the king of honorable sensuality stood there expectant , smiling , fair , and over the years Edmund came to associate Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of early middle age , the peculiar restlessness of its flesh , the incandescent furtiveness of Puritan adultery . . . . On the first instance the woman who appeared looked strikingly like Cousin April . Her hair was sleeked into a smooth glossy pageboy , as in the 1944 graduation pictures taken for the Miss Hewitt 's yearbook . Her fair athlete 's face was both lined and warmed by frequent sun and her pink lips opened in a photogenic smile as she clutched Jeff 's arm . Edmund imagined that in his school-bound life at St. Paul 's , Jeff could only have met these women at commencements , facultyparentteas , parents ' weekends , soccer matches . . . Edmund nevergreeted Jeff on these occasions , knowing the extent of his friend 's moral delicacy , his stated probity . . . he 'd usually duck into some restaurant to buy cigarettes , find a phone booth , do anything to respect the zeal of Jeff 's search for happiness . . . . These women , this charm-braceleted chorus line of Jeff 's middle-age felicity , sometimescarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the plane from a sunny Southern provenance still wearing short golf skirts , brief socks with pom-poms . . . . What better reassurance could Jeff have of the ancient order than these slender Junior Leaguers with faint crow 's lines and gleaming eyes whose braces barely seemed to have come off their teeth ? . . . Edmundenjoyed visualizing people 's domestic interiors and he imaginedthem at home , admitting Jeff to their bower while their husbandswere on business trips , their children away at camp or boardingschool . . . there might be a curved oval dressing table with starched white organdy ruffles like the ones that April and Katrinka had had in the forties . . . some childhood fetish  --  a white and woolly stuffed dog on a floral bedcover . . . the fetish would lie on the floor of the pink and flounced divorcing woman 's bedroom as she tossed in bed crying with joy at Jeff 's hungry , competent lovemaking . . . . Once in New York a colleague had enticed Edmund to have a drink after a lecture and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his palm was placed on the small of her athletic back as he steered her towards the dance floor with the same rolling , confident sailor 's gait with which he 'd moved through Larne 's , the Stork Club decades ago . . . . Katrinka had recapped her teeth , remarried twice , lost some of her overbite. . . in the last years ( so Edmund had gleaned from Sophie , who always knew everything ) Jeff had confined himself to shuttling back and forth between these two companions of his youth , April and Katrinka , Katrinka and April . . . a year after Claire had left for Minnesota he saw Jeff and April at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Sixty-second Street , outside the Knickerbocker Club , at the exact same spot where he 'd seen them in the late 19405 when he accompanied Claire and Sophie to some coming-out party . . . April was tanned and fitter than ever and had a barrette in her hair and wore a mink instead of a panda and was saying in her clearest Locust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'll fly to . . . " The cuffs of Jeff 's Brooks Brothers suit rode frugally high over his ankles and they were buying a little bag of roasted chestnutsfrom the street vendor , precisely as they had when he 'd glimpsed them on the same street corner a quarter of a century ago . " Who won Wimbledon this year ? " Claire once asked during one of Edmund 's visits to the monastery . " I think it was Kodes and Billie Jean , " he answered . And then continued : " Nixon should be prosecuted ; if only Bertrand Russell were still around to start a proper tribunal for war crimes , there should be another Nuremberg . . .. " He remembered that he was using the same phrases she 'd used five years ago . She was fingering a daisy and looking absentminded . " I 've realized here that any politics not grounded in spiritual substancewill dissipate into failure , " she said , " will even breed its own violence .... " " Dear one ! " Edmund leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stark serge gown . " Did n't you know that everything begins with mysticism and ends in politics to begin all over again in mysticism ? "  |p243He  had little idea of how traditional her beliefs were , whether the nuns questioned her concerning their catholicity ; she preferred not to discuss such " dogmatic " things . The few definitions she made had a limpid , brutal simplicity . " How do you pray ? " he once asked . " I mean , this has always struck me as the most difficult . How do you name Him , or It or whatever ? " " No matter . You have to name yourself first . Then it just comes . " And what . . . what if that fails ? " " Oh dear , you worry too much ! " she laughed . " No matter ! If you do n't find it in prayer you might find it in your own true work . " On one of his last visits to Claire , Edmund stopped at the pond neighboring the abbey on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . . . the animal was shuttling back and forth across the water with large branches in his mouth , depositing them upon his dam . . . . Each time he waddled onto shore and hovered near Edmund for a few seconds , as brown and lustrous as the water that was his home , before diving back for furthertasks . The intricate steering mechanism of his forelegs , whirringabout like propellers . . . The animal rose before Edmund one last time at the edge of the pond , monumental in the mystery of his work , his compulsion . . . and then as the mist rose over the darkening orange dusk he dove into the water again for his daily recreation . He swam about in large slow circles now , not fetching or carrying anymore , moving about in pure play , no purpose , all pleasure . . . once or twice he lashed his tail out upon the water with a flat broad motion , exploding the darkening pond into high white sprays and spumes . . . then dove under and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide meditative circles , having become his own contemplation , his own survival.  |p244THEY  begin their wait for Lenin 's tomb early in the morning . On their second day in Moscow members of Intourist Tour No. 137 line up in pairs as docilely as schoolchildren by the west wall of the Kremlin , Sophie clutching Claire 's arm . They stand behind hundreds of Soviet citizens , all patient in the burning sun , moving inch by inch towards the sepulcher of the embalmed leader . The expanse of Red Square looms before them , spelling perpetualvigilance , sided by crenellated ramparts , surmounted by numerouswatchtowers  --  slender as minarets , peaked like caps of Mongol princes , punctuated with belfries , sentry boxes , dungeons , turrets , lookouts . All color in the sullen capital converges prismaticallyat the heart of Soviet power , the battlements ' brick is the color of clotted blood and dormant fire , at the far end of the square the green and blue protuberances of St. Basil 's domes bristle like a bouquetof lapidary fruit . And at the center of the russet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite , militiamen in forest green guarding its massive doors , gleam of silver-plated bayonets . As the Intourist group starts to stand in queue , slender young Russians approach them , softly beseeching Americanp245coins , cigarettes , offering for exchange the star-shaped medallions of their belt buckles or more insignia of Lenin ; they whisper with the humility of beggar children , they brush swiftly against a foreignerand go on to another so as not to alert the soldiers guarding the visitors ' line . On their first morning in Moscow , Claire , Edmundand Sophie had risen at dawn to drive about Moscow by themselves . Their cabdriver was a cheerful , ruddy-cheeked man who talked effusively about Russians ' love for Richard Nixon . A good friend of the Soviet people , Brezhnev 's favorite Western leader ! Perhaps they have n't been told what 's happened yet , Claire quipped . Do you have a boy or a girl Sophie asked , do you love her very much , according to your last census sixty-five percent of Russianfamilies have no more than one child , where does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the day care center ? During their long queue for Lenin 's tomb members of the Intouristgroup try to talk among themselves . " Listen to this ! " Ethel Zabarreads from her guidebook . " Rushing upon Europe for the last time , Asia stomped the earth and left us the Kremlin . ' " Sophie : " Genghis Khan with the atom bomb , that 's what this country 's about , advanced technology mixed with total primitivism . . .. " Ted Weicker : " Oh , now listen , the effects of science are just as disastrous everywhere . . . . " A soldier guarding the file of visitors sternly puts a finger to his mouth . Irina and Evgeny mimic him with a parental smile , repeating that everyone must stand silently two by two , in pairs , when waiting to visit the mausoleum . At times Sophie leans heavily against Claire , eyes closed , her head buried in the shoulder of her friend 's coat . She ca n't sleep at all in Moscow , she turns down the Zabars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in Moscow . " What a labyrinth , what a nightmare . You go along Gorki Street and within ten minutes you 've circled back to the same sagging glory-to-Lenin sign you started from , and these resigned , contentious crowds shufflingabout , all you smell is solitude and fear .. ..

Liable to do anything . And I have to show him to the guest room and lay him out some fresh pajamas . The guest room , right next to Jadine .

You going to break up with him , lose all that just because he got drunk and let a crazy hobo spend the night .

" SYDNEY went out with the tray on which a steaming potato in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineglass , a napkin and a stack of mail . As the kitchen door swung on its hinges , Ondine took a deep breath . She had surprised herself . Before Sydney came in she was as nervous as he was . Still tastingher breakfast , too confused to quarrel with Yardman about the unplucked hen . She did n't put any stock in Jadine 's assurances , but when Sydney looked like he was falling apart , she 'd pulled herself together and talked sense . Good sense . That was what surprised her . She talked sense she did n't know she had about a situation that both frightened and disoriented her . But in talking to Sydney she knew what it was . The man was black . If he 'd been a white bum in Mrs. Street 's closet , well , she would have felt different . Sydney was right . It was his bone . Whether they liked it or not . But she was right , too . He had to drop it . The man upstairs was n't a Negro  --  meaning one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made Sydney understand that . ) Mr. Street might keep him for two days , three , for his own amusement . And even if he did n't steal , he was nasty and ignorant and they would have to serve him anyway , if Mr. Street wanted it . Clean his tub , change his bed linen , bring his breakfast to his bed if he wanted it , collect his underwear ( Jesus ) , call him sir , step aside if they met him in the hall , light his cigarettes , hold open his door , see to it there were fresh flowers in his room , books , a dish of mints . " Shoot , " she said aloud . " That nigger 's not going nowhere . No matter what they say . " Ondine picked up the chicken . Her fingersquickly found the joints they were searching for , and brokep103each one . Then she removed the wings from its back . The hen 's little elbows held a dainty V as though protecting its armpitsfrom the cold although it was noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the orchids was so hot it burned the children 's fingers  --  or would have , if any children lived at L'Arbe de la Croix . But none did . So the stamens of the orchids went untickled and the occupants of the lovely breezy house with the perfectly beveled cabinets heard no children 's screams and no tramp of red soldier ants marching toward the greenhouse , past the washhouse where a woman sat rubbing the dirt from her feet with one of seventeen Billy Blass towels . Stacked before her in two wicker baskets were the other sixteen , some everyday table napkins and tablecloths , assorted underwear and T-shirts , four white uniforms , four white shirts , a corset , six pairs of black nylon socks and two thin cotton nightgowns . She was happy as she sat there cleaning her calluses . Her laundry load was getting smaller each week and the bundle of clothes that traveled by motorboat to Cecile 's in Queen of France was gettingbigger and bigger . She knew quite well that she was supposedto be insulted by that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her heart of hearts she was happy . She put the black socks in a bucket to soak and dropped the corset in a basinful of soapy water and vinegar . She made the Billy Blass towels the first load for the washing machine since they took longest to dry . Once the machine began to agitate she could sit for a while and attend to her own thoughts while she waited for Gideon to come by her . From the pocket of her dress she pulled two wrinkled avocados and some smoked fish and placed them on a piece of newspaper and covered it all against flies with a stained Dior napkin . Then she disconnected the dryer , plugged in her hot plate and set an old drip-pot of coffee on to heat . She had no assigned lunch hour so she ate while the laundry washed itself . It was such a pleasure . Washing for these people was child 's play compared to the way she did it on Place de Vent . But at least there she had the pleasure of gossip overp104the tubs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music that came from the serre chaude ) , which is why she could hear the soldier ants so clearly and why she was so eager for Gideon to finish with the hens and join her on some pretext or other for if the heavy one with the braids crossed like two silver machetes on her head caught them chatting in the washhouse or in the garden behind , she would fly into a rage and her machetes would glitter and clang on her head . The silence was why she often brought Alma , and although the girl 's chatter was so young it made her head ache , it was better than listening to soldier ants trying one more time to enter the greenhouse and being thwarted as usual by the muslin dipped in poison and taped to the doorsill . She was sorry Alma could not come today . Gideon and she had a bet on how long the chocolate eater could last . Gideon said , " Long as he wants . Till New Year , " while she said , " No . The chocolate eater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . " And as they rowed back to Queen of France she raised the bet to 150,000 francs instead of the i oo , 000 she began with . She laughed and spat in the sea as she raised him , so confident was she . For she had seen evidence of the man who ate chocolate ( in the washhouse , in the trees , in the gazebo , down by the pond , in the toolshed , near the greenhouse ) . And it was he who brought the soldier ants onto the property with his trail of foil paper containingflecks of chocolate that the ants loved and sought vigorously . She had seen him in a dream smiling at her as he rode away wet and naked on a stallion . So she knew he was in agreement with her and any day now he would be discovered or reveal himself . As soon as she got out of the jeep that very morning , she was convinced that today was the day . A great rush of butterflies was what she noticed first and later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baskets of clothes , she instantlysaw that the machetes were not clanging now . They , like their owner , were subdued  --  by fear , she thought . The chocolatep105man would be the cause of that . She could think of nothing else  --  hurricane wind , or magic doll , diamondback or monkey teeth  --  that would quiet those curved and clanging knives . Only the man who ate chocolate in the night and lived like a foraging animal and who was as silent as a star could have done it . She had eaten the fish and one avocado and still Gideon had not come . She did n't want to start on the coffee , because it ran right through her and not having access to a toilet ( she felt unwelcomeeven in the kitchen ) she did not want to run off to the bushes behind the garden in the middle of his visit . She insisted she knew about the man before Gideon  --  although it was he who actually saw him first . She knew of his presence twelve days ago long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mistook for a fabricated attack against herself made up by machete-hairwho had asked her point-blank had she been taking chocolate and she had said , No , madame , over her shoulder to every query without allowing her eyes to see the heavy one ) . Beforethat mistakable trail , he left the unmistakable one of his smell . Like a beast who loses his animal smell after too long a diet of cooked food , a man 's smell is altered by a fast . She caught the scent twelve days ago : the smell of a fasting , or starving , as the case might be , human . It was the smell of human afterbirth that only humans could produce . A smell they reproduced when they were down to nothing for food . So a hungry man was on the grounds , or , as she said to Gideon , " Somebody 's starving to death round here . " And Gideon said , " Me , Therese , " and she said , " No , not you . A really starving somebody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her under the lime tree near the kitchen terrace and whispered that he 'd seen a swamp woman dart out from behind some trees near the pond . Therese stopped scaling grouper fish and said that what he saw was what she smelled and it could n't be a swamp woman because they had a pitchlike smell . What he saw must have been a rider . So she took to bringing two avocados instead of one and leaving the secondp106one in the washhouse . But each third day when she returned it was still there , untouched by all but fruit flies . It was Gideon who had the solution : instead of fixing the sash on the window of the pantry as he was ordered , he removed one of its panes and told machete-hair he was having trouble getting another . The heavy one fumed and removed " perishables " and things that attractedflies into the other kitchen until he could repair the window . In the meanwhile , they hoped the horseman would have access to the food left there . And soon they saw bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten from the pantry chocolate at the very least . Once Gideon saw an empty Evian bottle in the gazebo . Then they knew he had fresh water too . Therese removed the coffee pot from the stove and put it back five times before she heard Gideon 's footsteps . She poked her head out of the doorway , grinned and started to speak . " Sh , " he said , " sh . " His finger touched his lips . But Therese could not restrain herself . " Something 's going on . I can tell . " Then as he stepped inside and came close she saw his shirt . " You slaughter the hen or the hen slaughter you ? " Gideon held up one hand to shush her and with the other pulled the door shut . " Open the door , man , " she complained . " Too hot in here . " Gideon stood fast . " Listen , " he said . " He 's in the house . In it ! All out in the open ! I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Therese 's whisper was close to a shout . Gideon went to the coffee pot . Two cups were sitting on top of the folding table and he filled them both . " A little fridge out here would n't be a bad idea , " he said . " Just one of them little ones , like he got out in the greenhouse . Plug it up right there . . . " " Talk , man . Stop going on about a fridge . " " Would n't you like a little cold beer or chilled wine from time to time ? "  | " Cold beer ? " She looked at him in amazement . " That country ruined you , man . Stop fooling with me . Where did you see him ? " " In the window . Her window . " He took the chicken head and feet from his shirt and wrapped them in newspaper . " Doing what ? " " Looking . Just looking . A sheet or something wrapped around him , but bare naked on top . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Do n't think so . I pretended I was taking off my cap to scratch my head and looking off up in the trees . " " He did n't do anything ? Move ? " " Nope . Just looked around . Then I turned and walked back away . " Alone ? Was she with him ? " " Ca n't say . But it was in her room . Get what I mean ? And I saw her up there before naked as a worm when I was fixing to put up the tree . She jumped back , but did n't do no good . She do n't know I got eyes in the top of my head . Then next , about a hour or so later , there he was . Naked too , almost . Just a piece of white stuff around his waist . You reckon they got it on ? " He had stopped trying to appear uninterested and was openly enjoying the possibilities . " I told you ! " said Therese . " He 's a horseman come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around waiting for his chance . " " Maybe . Maybe . " Gideon looked at her milky eyes . " You damn near blind , but I have to hand it to you . Some things you see better than me . Otherwise why would a big strong-looking man be hiding round here like that ? Why this house all the time ? Why not over the other side , or up the road where those Fili ' pinos are ? He must have been looking for somebody specific . " " The chippy . The fast-ass , " said Therese . " That 's why he went straight up to her room . Because he knew she was here , he saw her from the hills . Maybe he 'll run her out of here . " " Back to the States , eh ? "  | " Or France even . Where that big box came from . Maybe he 's not a rider . Maybe he 's an old boyfriend and he the one sent her the box , Gideon . " " Hold on . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Tried to keep them apart . But it did n't work . He find her , swim the whole ocean big , till he find her , eh ? Make machete-hair too mad . Now she tell her bow-tie husband . . . " Therese sat on the wooden chair and rocked in the telling , pressing her fingers into Gideon 's shoulder as each new sequence presented itself to her . " Bow-tie get mad very . ' Cause he lives near machete-hair 's thumb . . . " The more she invented the more she rocked and the more she rocked the more her English crumbled till finally it became dust in her mouth stopping the flow of her imagination and she spat it out altogether and let the story shimmer through the clear cascade of the French of Dominique . Gideon could n't stop her , so he tried to gulp coffee while wardingoff the jabs to his shoulder . When she abandoned English he stopped listening for it was in French that she had tricked him into leaving the States after twenty years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shut his ears and tried to finish his coffee submitting to the shoulder jabs out of deference to her because she was his mother 's baby sister and because of a grudging respect for her magic breasts and because she had been able to trick him ( of all people ) with thirty-four letters in fifteen years , begging him to come home and take care of the property by which she must have meant herself because when he got there that 's all there was left : no land , no hills of coffee bush . Just Therese , two years his senior , and a cement house whose roof had to be put back on after every hurricane which meant four times a year . When he looked at the house  --  one of a dozen scattered over the emerald hill  --  and discovered that the 130 arpents he 'd remembered from his childhood belonged , like the emerald hills , to the Frenchman who lived in Guadeloupe and that except for the kitchen garden and the vil/lage garden on the riverbank there was no land to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craving for apples , he was n't even angry . Just amazed that he had believed those thirty-four letters written in perfect French by the priest at first and then by an acolyte describing the burden of managing so much property , too much for an old lady who nevertheless always thought of a way to get a ten-dollar money order out of him , and asking over and over again to make sure he brought apples when he came or to send them , and if he would let her know when that would be she would alert a friend at customs because apples were contrabandand could not be imported into Dominique which was true because only French-grown fruit and vegetables could arrive at that port or be sold in the stores . And ships unloaded wilted lettuce , thin rusty beans and pithy carrots every month . A hardshipfor the rich and the middle class , neither of whom would consider working a kitchen garden ( except , of course , the American , who made it a hobby ) and were dependent on the market but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gardens , from the sea and from the avocado trees that grew by the side of the road . Only Therese had tasted apples once when she was seven and again when she was thirty-five and had a craving for them akin to hysteria . When Gideon appeared in 1973 with twelve apples hidden in the lining of his electric blue leisure suit which Therese 's friends at customs noticed  --  but for two dollars U.S. ignored  --  her gratitude was so complete he did n't get on the next plane back as he threatened . After all he had n't left much : just U.S. citizenship , the advantage of which was the ability to send an occasional ten-dollar money order , buy a leisure suit and watch TV . Most of the friends of his youth had emigratedto France , but the stories of their lives there were so heartbreaking , he 'd chosen Quebec instead although he had to wait until he was twenty-two for a visa and then he arrived in the coat pocket so to speak of a Canadian farmer . And two years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro ) got into the States where money orders , leisure suits and TVp110abounded . Now that he 'd come back what was there to do but build a new roof after each hurricane , find a little work , and wait for carnival ? At first he was ashamed before his family and friends . Just as Therese had lied to him , so had he lied to her about the wealth he had accumulated in the States . Now there he was for all the world to see building another temporary roof , looking for tourist tips , eying women at the bars  --  just like before . With no suitcase of American dollars . Just twelve apples and a leisure suit . Humiliating . Who but an ass would go back to Dominique with no more than what he had when he left ? Those who wished desperately to come back ( from France , Quebec , New York City or wherever ) could not , would not , unless they were accompanied by the college certificates or money they had gone to find . He spoke English very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an asset on the island , but at his age with no certificate and out of touch with friends who could make a way for him he could not carry luggage at the airlines , or wait tables at the Old Queen . So he drifted to the docks for a few days ' work or got a lucky day collecting fares for a taxi man until , finally , all of his forty years of immigrant labor paid off when an American who owned a house on Isle des Chevaliers came to stay and needed a regular handyman/gardener with boat skills , English and a manner less haughty than that of the local Blacks . For in spite of the fact that they built their houses four times a year the natives of Dominique did not hide the contempt they felt in their hearts for everybody but themselves . Gideon got over the shame : the work at Isle des Chevaliers , which began for a season and had lasted three years , helped and so did the fact that the jokes and insults heaped on him by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which U.S. citizenship did not change . Also the thought of being able to die in those coffee-growing hills rather than in those lonely Stateside places gave him so much happiness he could not hold a grudge or sustain anger for more than an hour . Unlike Therese whose hatreds were complex and passionate asp111exemplified by her refusal to speak to the American Negroes , and never even to acknowledge the presence of the white Americans in her world . To effect this she believed all she had to do was not look at them ( or rather not look at them while they looked at her ) so her face was always turned away when they addressed her and her glance ( when it was not on her work ) went to a distant point on the horizon which she could not have seen if her life depended on it . What they took for inattentiveness was a miracle of concentration . " Hush , Therese , " said Gideon . " They can hear you in the harbor . Finish making up your romance in your head . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abused shoulder . " But you forgetting one thing in your story . One important thing . I said I saw him in the house , in the open . Open . Get it ? Now there are five people living there . Not three . And two of them is white and the same two is the boss of everything as well . While you making up your story about what this one thinks and this one feels , you have left out the white bosses . What do they feel about it ? It 's not importantwho this one loves and who this one hates and what bowtiedo or what machete-hair do n't do if you do n't figure on the white ones and what they thinking about it all . " He tapped her on the chest bone and left her sitting there with a half-finished plot on her tongue . Therese unplugged the hot plate and put the last of the Billy Blass towels in the dryer . Then she put all the white shirts and uniforms into the washing machine . The load was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossiping with Gideon so she left it that way . She sat down again on the chair and began sloshing the black socks of the bow-tie husband . It was true , she thought . She had forgotten the white Americans . How would they fit into the story ? She could not imagine them . In her story she knew who the others were : the chocolateeatingman was a lover , the fast-ass a coquette who had turned him down ; the other two were the traditional hostile family . She understood , that , but now she had to get a grasp of the tall thinp112American who played in the greenhouse whom she had never seen clearly and certainly never spoken to . And also the wife with the sunset hair and milk-white skin . What would they feel ? She realized then that all her life she thought they felt nothing at all . Oh , well , yes , she knew they talked and laughed and died and had babies . But she had never attached any feeling to any of it . She thought of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alma talked about , the two little French girls she took care of one day when the governess ran away , and the hundreds of French babies who used to nurse at her magical breasts . What went on inside them ? Inside . Therese resented the problem and the necessity for solving it to get on with the story . " What difference does it make , " she murmured . " I do n't know what they would think about him , but I know for certain what they would do about him . Kill him . Kill the chocolate-eating black man . Kill him dead . Ah . Poor thing . Poor , poor thing . He dies and the fast-ass is brought low at last . Too late , bitch  --  too late you discover how wonderful he really was . How gentle , how kind . And you are full of remorse , but too late , cow , too too late ; you will never have him now . And you machete-hair and you bow-tie you will think everything is all right now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the fast-ass is grief-stricken and will blame you for his untimely death and hate you forever . So you can go back to the States the whole pack of you and choke to death on your big red apples . " T H E S K I N of the baby seals sucked up the dampness of her own . Jadine closed her eyes and imagined the blackness she was sinking into . She lay spread-eagled on the fur , nestling herself into it . It made her tremble . She opened her lips and licked the fur . It made her tremble more . Ondine was right ; there was something a little fearful about the coat . No , not fearful , seductive . After a few more moments of nestling she got up and made preparations to take another shower and to get dressed . Thep113clock showed twelve-thirty and she still had to phone Solange , answer letters , and see about Margaret . She would need soothing . Maybe they would take their fruit and cold consomme clown by the fish pond or farther up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her bedroom , they had alreadymissed their session of exercise and muscle-tightening calisthenics . Valerian would be in the greenhouse through lunch where he usually had a baked potato or some other single item . Only Ondine and Sydney ate a substantial lunch .. Both had three very full meals a day and their menu was in no way related to what was served at Valerian 's table . Jadine came out of the shower as moist as she was when she went in , so she dressed as slowly as possible in order to prevent more perspiration . The emperor butterflies were back now agitating the air . Jadinewatched them languidly as she brushed her hair and bound it into a knot at the top of her head . Then she pulled a few strands over her ears and temples to soften the look . On impulse she put on her coat again and she was looking in a full-length mirror judging the effect when the smell hit her . She moved a little to her left to see what the mirror reflected behind her . There he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a riverbed , his eyes as steady and clear as a thief 's . " Morning , " he said , and smiled bringing once more into view the small dark dogs galloping on silver feet . Jadine could not find her tongue . She was staring into the mirror at his hair . Last night , sitting with Valerian in the soft light of the dining room , it had looked merely long and unkempt . Here , alone in her bedroom where there were no shadows , only glimmering unrelieved sunlight , his hair looked overpowering  --  physically overpowering , like bundles of long whips or lashes that could grab her and beat her to jelly . And would . Wild , aggressive , vicious hair that needed to be put in jail . Uncivilized , reform-school hair . Mau Mau , Attica , chain-gang hair . " Good morning . " He said it again.  |p114She  struggled to pull herself away from his image in the mirrorand to yank her tongue from the roof of her mouth . She was sober now and the thought that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Margaret had seen clearly , was framed for her now in the fruitwood of the mirror : this man had been living among them ( in their things ) for days . And they had not known it . What had he seen or heard ? What was he doing there ? " Hey . I was saying good morning to you . " She turned , freed at last from the image in the mirror . " You could knock , you know . " " The door was open . " He gestured to the door behind him . " But it 's still a door and can be knocked on . " He seemed to close his eves to her without shutting the lids , and what was left of his smile disappeared into his beard and the riverbed darkness of his face . This is wrong , she thought . I should n't make him angry . " I 'm sorry , but you startled me . Did you sleep well ? " He nodded but did not return the smile she dredged up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , glancing around the room . " Oh . " She laughed and , to hide her confusion , shed her sealskincoat , throwing it on the bed . " There 's no handle . Just push the knob in the center . It 'll come on . It took me a while too , at first . " He looked past her to the sealskin coat sprawled on the bed . Jadine flushed as though he could see the print of her nipples and thighs in the pelts . He walked toward the coat and the bed . The pajamas they 'd given him were too small  --  the sleeves ended somewhere between wrist and elbow and the pants leg came to just above his shins . As he stood looking at the coat she could not tell whether he or it was the blacker or the shinier , but she knew she did not want him to touch it . " I 'll get Sydney to get some clothes for you if you like . " Thenp115thinking of Sydney 's response to that chore she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " " Who ? " He turned away from the coat . " Yardman . The gardener . " " That his name ? " " No . " She smiled , searching for the leashes of the small dark clogs . " But he answers to it . Which is something , at least . Some people do n't have a name of any kind . " He smiled too , moving away from the bed toward her . " What do you like ? Billy ? Paul ? What about Rastus ? " " Do n't be funny . What is your name ? " " What 's yours ? " " Jade . " He shook his head as though he knew better . " Okay . Jadine . Jadine Childs . " She reached for a cigarette . " Can I have one of those ? " " Sure . " She gestured toward the escritoire for him to help himself . He pulled out a Gauloise filter , lit it and began to cough . " Been a long time , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jadine grabbed the leashes . " Keep the pack , " she said . " There 's plenty more if you want them . " He nodded and took another drag with a little more success . " Who 's the copper Venus ? " he asked her . Jadine dropped the leashes . " Where did you see that ? " " I did n't see it . I heard it . " " Where ? " She could not find them , they were gone . " The woman who comes to work here . She talks to herself out . in the washhouse . " Now she had them again , safely back in her fingers . " Mary . It must have been Mary . " Jadine laughed . " That was a publicity thing . When I was modeling they called me that . I wonder how Mary knows about it . I do n't think she can even read . " " You were a model ? " He narrowed his eyes with interest.  |p116Jadine  walked over to a large straw chest . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After rummaging awhile she pulled out a fashion magazine with her face on the cover . When she handed it to him he sat down at the desk and made a flute sound between his teeth . And then another as his eyes traveled from the crown of her head to the six centimeters of cleavage supported ( more or less ) by silver lame . Her hair in the picture was pressed flat to her head , pulled away from her brow revealing a neat hairline . Her eyes were the color of mink and her lips wet and open . He continued the flute sounds and then opened the magazine . After flipping the pages for a few seconds he came to a four-page spread of her in other poses , other clothes , other hair , but always the same wet and open lips . " Goddamn , " he whispered . " Go-oddamn . " Jadine said nothing , but she held on tight to the leashes . The look on his face made her smile . He examined the pictures closely , whispering " shit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What does it say ? " He put the magazine flat on the desk , turned at an angle so she could read and translate the text . " Oh , it 's just stuff about me . " She leaned on the edge of the desk facing him and the magazine . " Where I went to school . Things like that . " " Read it to me . " Jadine leaned over and translated rapidly the important parts of the copy . " Mademoiselle Childs . . . graduate of the Sorbonne . . . an accomplished student of art history . . . a degree in . . . is an expert on cloisonne , having visited and worked with the Master Nape . . . . An American now living in Paris and Rome , where she had a small but brilliantly executed role in a film by . . . " She stopped . The man was tracing her blouse with his forefinger . " This , " he said , lifting his finger from the picture to point at the caption beneath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a description of the dress . Natural raw silk . . . honey-colored . . . " " Right here it says fast lane . ' What 's that about ? " " Oh , they 're trying to be hip . It says , If you travel as Jade does in what the Americans call the fast lane , you need elegant but easy-to-pack frocks . ' Then it goes on about the jewelry . " " What about the jewelry ? " Now he traced the heaps of gold necklaces above the honey-colored silk . " The total worth of it is  --  " she calculated quickly from francs into dollars  --  " thirty-two thousand dollars . " " Thirty-two thousand ? " " Um-hm . " " Shit . And the earrings ? Do they talk about the earrings ? " He was looking at a facing close-up of her , from the nose down to the first swell of her breasts , which featured earrings , a sculptured piece around her throat and again the wet and open lips . " Lovely , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Catherine the Great . A queen , huh ? " " Empress . The Empress of all the Russias . " " She give them to you ? " " Stupid ! She 's been dead for almost two hundred years . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Yeah . " She drew out the word and made it as flat and Americanas she could . But she was smiling at the same time . " They must be worth a lot , then . " " Quite a lot . Priceless . " " Nothing 's priceless . Everything has a price . " He was tracing again , circling Catherine 's earrings with his forefinger . Jadine felt her earlobes prickle as she watched him . " Well , half a million , certainly . " " Half a million ? Shit . " " Do n't you have any other word to express awe ? " She tilted her head and fastened her big minky eyes on him.  |p118He  nodded . " Goddamn . " She laughed then , and for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He merely smiled and continued fingering the photograph . " Are these your clothes or did they just let you use them for the pictures ? " " They 're mine . Some were given to me after I was photographed . A kind of payment . " " And the jewelry ? They give you that too ? " " No . That was mine from before  --  except the earrings . They were on loan from the Russians . But the rest is part of my own collection . " " Collection , huh ? " " Why ? Are you a thief ? " " I wish I was . Be a lot easier for me if I could steal . " " If ? What do you call what you were doing in this house for days ? Or were you planning to give Ondine back her chocolate ? " " You call that stealing ? " " You do n't . " He shook his head . " No . I call it eating . If I wanted to steal I had plenty of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape with what you took . So maybe there was no point in stealing . Then . " " You think there 's a point in my stealing now ? " " There might be . It depends on what you want from us . " " Us ? You call yourself us ' ? " Of course . I live here . " " But you . . . you 're not a member of the family . I mean you do n't belong to anybody here , do you ? " " I belong to me . But I live here . I work for Margaret Street . She and Valerian are my . . . patrons . Do you know what that means ? " " They take care of you . Feed you and all . " " They educated me . Paid for my travel , my lodgings , my clothes , my schools . My mother died when I was twelve ; my father when I was two . I 'm an orphan . Sydney and Ondine arep119all the family I have , and Valerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was silent , still staring at the pictures . Jadine examined his profile and made sure the leather was knotted tightly around her wrists . " Why do n't you look at me ? " she asked him . " I ca n't , " he said . " Why ca n't you ? " " The pictures are easier . They do n't move . " Jadine felt a flash of pity . " You want me to be still ? Will you look at me if I 'm still ? " He did n't answer . " Look , " she said . " I 'm still . Very still . " He lifted his head and looked at her . Her eyes were minkcoloredjust like in the pictures , and her lips were like the picturestoo . Not moist , but open a little , the way they were in sleep . The way they were when he used to slip into her room and wait hours , hardly breathing himself , for the predawn light to bring her face out of the shadows and show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those times in order to manipulateher dreams , to insert his own dreams into her so she would not wake or stir or turn over on her stomach but would lie still and dream steadily the dreams he wanted her to have about yellowhouses with white doors which women opened and shouted Come on in , you honey you ! and the fat black ladies in white dresses minding the pie table in the basement of the church and white wet sheets flapping on a line , and the sound of a six-string guitar plucked after supper while children scooped walnuts up off the ground and handed them to her . Oh , he thought hard , very hard during those times to press his dreams of icehouses into hers , and to keep her still and dreaming steadily so that when she woke finally she would long as she had longed for nothing in her life for the sound of a nickel nickelodeon , but after a while he began to smell like an animal in that room with her and he was afraid his smell would waken her before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers and breathe into her open mouth his final dream of the men in magenta slacks who stood on corners under sky-blue skies and sang " If I Did n't Care " like the Ink Spots , and he fought hard against the animal smell and fought hard to regulate his breathing to hers , but the animal smell got worse and her breathing was too light and shallow for his own lungs and the sun always eschewed a lingering dawn in that part of the world and strutted into the room like a gladiator so he barely had time to breathe into her the smell of tar and its shiny consistency before he crept away hoping that she would break wind or believe she had so the animal smell would not alarm her or disturb the dream he had placed there . But now she was not sleeping ; now she was awake and even though she was being still he knew that at any moment she might talk back or , worse , press her dreams of gold and cloisonne and honey-colored silk into him and then who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much ? " he asked her . " Was it a lot ? " His voice was quiet . " What are you talking about ? How much what ? " " Dick . That you had to suck , I mean to get all that gold and be in the movies . Or was it pussy ? I guess for models it 's more pussy than cock . " He wanted to go on and ask her was it true what the black whores always said , but she was hitting him in the face and on the top of his head with a badly formed fist and calling him an ignorant motherfucker with the accent on the syllable ig . Jadine jumped away from the desk and leaned forward trying to kill him with her fists while her mind raced to places in the room where there might be a poker or a vase or a sharp pair of shears . He turned his head a little but did not raise his arms to protect himself . All he had to do was what he did : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head out of her easy reach . She stretched nonetheless trying to tear the whites from his eyes . He caught both her wrists and crossed them in front of her face . She spit full in his face but the saliva fell on the C of his pajama top.  |p121Her  gold-thread slippers were no good for kicking but she kicked inyhow . He uncrossed her wrists and swung her around , holding her from behind in the vise of his arms . His chin was in her hair . Jadine closed her eyes and pressed her knees together . " You smell , " she said . " You smell worse than anything I have ever smelled in my life . " " Shh , " he whispered in her hair , " before I throw you out the window . " " Valerian will kill you , ape . Sydney will chop you , slice " No , they wo n't . " " You rape me and they 'll feed you to the alligators . Count on it , nigger . You good as dead right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think somebody 's trying to rape you ? " " White ? " She was startled out of fury . " I 'm not . . . you know I 'm not white ! " " No ? Then why do n't you settle down and stop acting like it . " " Oh , God , " she moaned . " Oh , good God , I think you better throw me out of the window because as soon as you let me loose I am going to kill you . For that alone . Just for that . For pulling that black-woman-white-woman shit on me . Never mind the rest . What you said before , that was nasty and mean , but if you think you can get away with telling me what a black woman is or ought to be . . . " " I can tell you . " He nestled his cheek in her hair as she struggledin his arms . " You ca n't , you ugly barefoot baboon ! Just because you 're black you think you can come in here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shot you on the spot . But no . A white man thought you were a human being and should be treated like one . I Ie 's civilized and made the mistake of thinking you might be too . That 's because he did n't smell you . But I did and I know you 're an animal because I smell you . " He rubbed his chin in her hair and blew at the little strandp122over her ears . " I smell you too , " he said , and pressed his loins as far as he could into the muted print of her Madeira skirt . " I smell you too . " His voice was soft , breathy and seemed to her to come from a great height . Someplace far far up , higher than the ceiling , higher than the ake trees even and it frightened her . " Let me go , " she said , surprised at the steadiness of her own voice and even more surprised that he did it . She stood with her back to him , rubbing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't say anything so she turned to face him and repeated , " I 'll have to tell Valerian . " He nodded . " Tell him , " he said . " All of it or part of it . Whateveryou like . " " I will , " she said , and started walking toward the door , clicking her gold-thread slippers on the tile . " Except for one thing , " he said . " Leave out one thing . Do n't tell him that I smelled you . " She walked out the door and down the hall . She meant to go to the downstairs powder room and clean him off her , but she did n't want to stop walking just yet , so she descended the staircase , crossed the front hall and opened the door . The gravel of the driveway hurt her feet in the little gold-thread slippers , but she went on , rubbing her wrists , feeling frightened and then angry , then frightened then angry again . When she got to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued until she came to a large stone by the side of the road . She sat down on it under the eyes of an avocado tree and lifted the hem of her skirt to wipe her face . She would tell Valerian to get rid of him that very afternoon . He would go and that would be that . A minor episode in an otherwise uneventfulwinter in the Caribbean . Something to chat about at supper , to elaborate on with friends , and laugh and laugh and say , " Can you believe it ? He was in the house all that time ! And when we found him , we invited him to dinner where he sat down andp123poured the coffee into his saucer and said Hi ' to the butler . Ha ha , you should have seen Sydney 's face and Margaret was out of her mind , but Valerian was superb , as you might guess , you know Valerian , right ? Totally unflappable . Totally ! But I was about to wet my pants , right ? . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell that part , although it was funny , especially about how he asked her did Catherine the Great give her those earrings ( he actually believed it , that they had belonged.to the empress ) , and how he kept fingering her pictures , but she could n't tell about the question he asked her : how much did she have to suck . She would make it some other impudence so she could get to the part about smashing his face and his trying to rape her , and maybe she could say that he was so dumb and country he thought she was white probably because she had a bath that morning and did n't have any hoops in her ears , and that he did n't want to rape her after all , but was content just to smell her . No , she 'd leave out the smelling part . She would not mention that part at all . Jadine felt the fear again and another thing that was n't fear . Something more like shame . Because he was holding my wrists so tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nasty motherfucker . Really nasty . Stink nasty . Maybe that was it . His smell . Other men had done worse to her and tried worse but she was always able to talk about it and think about it with appropriatedisgust and amusement . But not this . He had jangled something in her that was so repulsive , so awful , and he had managed to make her feel that the thing that repelled her was not in him , but in her . That was why she was ashamed . He was the one who smelled . Rife , ripe . But she was the one he wanted to smell . Like an animal . Treating her like another animal and both of them must have looked just like it in that room . One dog snif fingat the hindquarters of another , and the female , her back to him , not moving , but letting herself be sniffed , letting him nuzzle her asshole as the man had nuzzled hers , the bitch never minding that the male never looked in her face or ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nowhere , smelled her ass and stuckp124his penis in , humping and jerking and grinding away while she stood there bearing , actually bearing his whole weight as he pummeled around inside her not even speaking , or barking , his eyes sliced and his mouth open and dripping with saliva , and other dogs too , waiting , circling until the engaged dog was through and then they would mount her also in the street in broad daylight no less , not even under a tree or behind a bush , but right there on Morgan Street in Baltimore with cars running by and children playing and the retired postman coming out of his house in his undershirt shouting get that bitch out of here . She 's in heat . Lock that bitch up . Every goddamn dog in town 'll be over here and he went back inside to get a mop handle to run the males off and crack the bitch over the back and send her home , she who had done nothing but be " in heat " which she could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she who was beaten and cracked over the head and spine with the mop handle and made to run away and I felt sorry for her and went looking for her to see if she was hurt and when I found her she was behind the gas station standing very quietly while another dog sniffed her ass embarrassing me in the sunlight . All around her it was like that : a fast crack on the head if you let the hunger show so she decided then and there at the age of twelve in Baltimore never to be broken in the hands of any man . Whatever it took  --  knife blades or screaming teeth  --  Never . And yes , she would tap dance , and yes , she would skate , but she would do it with a frown , pugnacious lips and scary eyes , because Never . And anybody who wanted nice from this little colored girl would have to get it with pliers and chloroform , because Never . When her mother died and she went to Philadelphia and then away to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teacher , and no , I do not smile , because Never . It smoothed out a little as she grew older . The pugnacious lips became a seductive pout  --  eyes more heated than scary . But beneath the easy mannerswas a claw always ready to rein in the dogs , because Never . " Tell him , " he said . " Tell him anything but do n't tell him Ip125smelled you because then he would understand that there was something in you to smell and that I smelled it and if Valerian understands that then he will understand everything and even if he makes me go away he will still know that there is something in you to be smelled which I have discovered and smelled myself . And no sealskin coat or million-dollar earrings can disguise it . You son of a bitch I need this like a wart . I came here to get some rest and have some peace and find out if I really wanted to kick my legs up on a runway and let buyers with Binaca breath lick my ears or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer games for the rest of my life and looking for another Bezzi or if I should buy an Alfa and drive through Rome making the scene where producers and agents can see me and say Cara mia is it really you I have just the part ! I came here to do some serious thinking and the fact is that I can come here . I belong here . You , motherfucker , do not and you , motherfucker , are leaving now as soon as I tell Valerian what you did to me and the harbor police will be here and return you to the sharks where you belong . Damn Valerian , what does he think he 's doing ? Playing white people 's games ? Or what the hell is the matter with him ? He sits there and complains about Margaret , practically breaks down thinking about his son and talks about how he loves them both and has sacrificed everything for their happiness and then watches her go crazy , she 's so scared . And instead of protecting her or at least getting upset he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to dinner and lets him sleep down the hall from us all . Does n't he know the difference between one Black and another or does he think we 're all . . . Some mess this is . Jadine cupped her elbows in her palms and rocked back and forth on the stone trying hard to pull herself together before she went back to talk to Valerian , to tell him he and his joke had gone too far and might backfire . She sat for a long time , longer than necessary since she had already made up her mind . Shep126started to stand several times , but each time something held her to the rock . Something very like embarrassment . Embarrassment at the possibility of overreacting , as she told her aunt and uncle they were doing . More awful than the fear of danger was the fear of looking foolish  --  of being excited when others were laid back  --  of being somehow manipulated , surprised or shook . Sensitive people went into therapy and stayed there when they felt out of control . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there real danger ? But there was more . She felt a curious embarrassment in the picture of herself telling on a black man to a white man and then watching those red-necked gendarmes zoom him away in a boat . But he was going to rape her ; maybe Margarettoo , or worse . She could n't wait for Valerian to get bored or sober or come to his senses and she could n't risk hanging loose in this place where there was no one really to call on , where they were virtually alone . It would have to be done now , in the light of day . There was no betrayal in that . That nigger knew better and if he did n't he was crazy and needed to be hauled away . Besides that fear and the fear of fear , there was another authenticloathing that she felt for the man . With him she was in strange waters . She had not seen a Black like him , in ten years . Not since Morgan Street . After that in the college she attended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had every girl in a 150-mile radius at their feet . She was barely noticeable in ( and never selected from ) that stampede . Later when she traveled her society included Blacks and whites in profusion , but the black people she knew wanted what she wanted  --  either steadily and carefully like Sydney and Ondine or uproariouslyand flashily like theater or media types . But whatever their scam , " making it " was on their minds and they played the game with house cards , each deck issued and dealt by the house . With white people the rules were even simpler . She needed only to be stunning , and to convince them she was not as smart as they were . Say the obvious , ask stupid questions , laugh with abandon , look interested , and light up at any display of their humanity ifp127they showed it . Most of it required only charm  --  occasionally panache . None of it called for this . . . this . . . " Oh , horseshit ! " she said aloud . It could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . The avocado tree standing by the side of the road heard her and , having really seen a horse 's shit , thought she had probably misused the word . Jadinedusted off the back of her skirt and turned toward the house . The avocado tree watched her go then folded its leaves tightly over its fruit . When Jade got near the greenhouse she thought she saw two figures behind the translucent panes . One was gesticulating wildly . Her heart pounding , she raced to the open door and peeped in . There they were . Valerian and the man , both laughing to beat the band.  | " LAUGHING ? " Margaret could not believe her ears . " I 'm telling you ! They were in there laughing ! I was looking right at them when you called out the window . " " Good God . What 's gotten into him ? " " I do n't know . " " Are you scared ? " " Not really . Well , sort of . " " You do n't know him , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him ? " " I do n't know . This is making me crazy . Maybe we should do something . " " What ? We 're the only women . And Ondine . Should I go to the Broughtons ' and . . . " Jadine stopped and sat down on Margaret 's bed . She shook her head . " This is too much . " " What did he say ? " asked Margaret . " When you all had dinner ? Did he say what he was doing here ? " " Oh , he said he was hiding . That he 'd been looking for food after he jumped ship a few days ago . That he was trying to get something out of the kitchen and heard footsteps and ran up the stairs to hide . Apparently he did n't know what room he went into , he was just waiting for a chance to get back out . " " Do you believe him ? " " I believe some of it . I mean I do n't believe he came here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but not you . ) " How did he get here ? " " He says he swam . "  | " That 's impossible . " " It 's what he said . " " Well , then he can swim back . Now . Today . I 'm not going to sleep with him in this house . If I had known that I would have had a heart attack . All night I waited for that bastard Valerian to come up here and tell me what the hell was going on . He never showed . " " And Sydney was patrolling the halls with a gun . I thought he would have killed him by now . " " What does he think ? " " He 's angry . Ondine 's scared , I think . " " I 'm going to have it out with Valerian . He 's doing this just to ruin Christmas for me . Michael 's coming and he knows I want everything right for him , and look what he does to get me upset . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nigger . " " Right , nigger , instead of throwing him right out of here . " " Maybe we 're making something out of nothing . " " Jade . He was in my closet . He had my box of souvenirs in his lap . " " Open ? " " No . Not open . Just sitting there holding it . He must have picked them up from the floor . Oh , God , he scared the shit out of me . He looked like a gorilla ! " Jadine 's neck prickled at the description . She had volunteered nigger  --  but not gorilla . " We were all scared , Margaret , " she said calmly . " If he 'd been white we would still have been scared . " " I know , I know . " " Look . Valerian let him in . Valerian has to get him out . I 'm sure he will anyway but you talk to him and I will too . It will lac all right . You want to calm down . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to breathe , we have to do something . We ca n't leave it up to Valerian . Listen , let 's leave : take the boat to townp130and fly to Miami . We wo n't come back till he 's gone . Oh , but Michael ! " She touched her hair . " I 'll telephone him . He can meet us in Miami and if Valerian 's got his senses back . . . " " But it 's the twenty-second . There is n't time . And what about Sydney and Ondine ? " " You do n't think he 'd go after Ondine , do you ? Well , we 'll start . We 'll look like we 're going and tell Valerian why . We can call the police ourselves when we get to town . Is the boy here ? " Margaret asked . " Yes , but  --  " " Jade . Come on , now . You 've got to help . There 's nobody else . " " Let 's see if Valerian will send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . " " Let 's wait and see . Pack just in case . I 'll get reservations . " " All right . But I 'm not going to leave this room until I know something definite . " " I 'll bring you something to eat . " " Yes , and please hurry . I do n't want to take a Valium on an empty stomach . " They stayed in their rooms all afternoon , and the next time they saw the stranger he was so beautiful they forgot all about their plans . WHEN J A D I N E had clicked out of her bedroom in her gold-thread slippers , the man sat down in her chair and lit another cigarette . He listened to the four/four time of her clickingshoes , tapping it out on the little writing table . The seat was too small for him  --  like a grade school chair  --  even though he had lost the ship-food weight and now  --  after two weeks of scavenging  --  his body was as lean as a runner 's . He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Not at all the way it appeared at dawn when he crouched there watching her sleep and trying to change herp131dreams . Then it looked mysterious but welcoming . Now in the noon light it looked fragile  --  like a dollhouse for an absent doll  --  except for the sealskin coat sprawled on her bed which looked more alive than seals themselves . He had seen them gliding like shadows in water off the coast of Greenland , moving like supple rocks on pebbly shores , and never had they looked so alive as they did now that their insides were gone : lambs , chickens , tuna , children  --  he had seen them all die by the ton . ' Mere was nothing like it in the world , except the slaughter of whole families in their sleep and he had seen that , too . He took another cigarette and walked to a table to look at the presents she 'd started to wrap . Two damp spots formed on the yoke of his pajamas . Still smoking , he left off looking at the packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie saw a fixture exactly like the one in the bathroom down the hall . But her shower had curtains , not sliding doors . Heavy shiny curtains with pictures of old-fashioned ladies all over . Towel material was on the other side , still damp . Water glistened on the tub and wall tile . On the corner of the tub was a bottle of Neutrogena Rainbath Gel and a natural sponge , the same color as her skin . He picked up the sponge and squeezed it . Water gushed from the cavities . Careless , he thought . She should wring it out thoroughly , otherwise it would rot . The sponge was so large he wondered how her small hands held it . He squeezed it again , but lightly this time , loving the juice it gave him . Unbuttoning his pajama top he rubbed it on his chest and under his arms . Then he took the pajamas off altogether and stepped into the shower . " Pull , " she had said . Tepid water hit him full in the face . He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower head , pulled again and water peppered his chest . After a moment he noticed that the shower head was removable and he lifted it from its clamps to let it play all over his skin . He never let go the sponge . When he was wet all over , he let the shower head dangle while he picked up the bath gel , pumpingp132the spout above the sponge . He lathered himself generously and rinsed . The water that ran into the drain was dark  --  charcoalgray . As black as the sea before sunrise . His feet were impossible . A thick crust scalloped his heels and the balls of both feet . His fingernails were long and caked with dirt . He lathered and rinsed twice before he felt as though he 'd accomplished anything . The sponge felt good . He had never used one before . Always he had bathed with his own hands . Now he pumped a dollop of bath gel into his palm and soaped his beard , massaging as best he could with his nails . The beard hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face up and sprayed water on it . Too hard . He stopped , wiped his eyes and fiddled with the head until he got mist instead of buckshot . He soaped his face again and misted the lather away . Some of it got into his mouth and reminded him of a flavor he could not name . He sprayed more and swallowed it . It did not taste like water ; it tasted like milk . He squirted it all around in his mouth before pressing the button to shut off the water . He got out dripping and looking around for shampoo . He was about to give up , not seeing any medicine cabinets , when he accidentallytouched a mirror that gave way to reveal shelf upon shelf of bottles among which were several of shampoo boasting placenta protein among their ingredients . The man chose one and stood before the mirror looking at his hair . It spread like layer upon layer of wings from his head , more alive than the sealskin . It made him doubt that hair was in fact dead cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely alive . Left alone and untended it was like foliage and from a distance it looked like nothing less than the crown of a deciduous tree . He knew perfectly well what it was that had frightened her , paralyzed her for a moment . He could still see those minky eyes frozen wide in the mirror . Now he stuck his head under the shower and wet the hair till it fell like a pelt over his ears and temples . Then he soaped and rinsed , soaped and rinsed until it was asp133metallic and springy as new wire . After he dried it , he found a toothbrush and brushed his teeth furiously . Rinsing his mouth he noticed blood . He was bleeding from the gums of his perfect teeth . He unscrewed the cap from a bottle of Listerine with instructions in French on the label and gargled . Finally he wrapped a white towel around his waist . He noticed another door in the bathroom and opened it with the easy familiarity of someone who has been there before . It led to a dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror circled by lights . Farther along were dresses , shelves of shoe boxes , luggage , and a narrow lingerie chest . On a tiny chair lay shorts and a white tennis visor . The smell of perfume nauseated him  --  he had not eaten since the gobbling of cold souffle and peaches the night before . He picked a robe , returned to the bathroom and urinated . Then he stooped to pick up the pajamas , damp and bunched on the floor , but changed his mind , left them there and walked back through the bedroom . The breeze from the open window was sweet and he went to it and stood looking out . They are frightened , he thought . All but the old man . The old man knows that whatever I jumped ship for it was n't because I wanted to rape a woman . Women were not on his mind and however strange it looked , he had not followed the women . He did n't even see them properly . When the boat docked , he stayed in the closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock and when he went , at last , to look , all he saw were two slim-backed women floating behind the beam of a flashlight toward what looked like a jeep . They got in , turned on the lights , then the engine ( in that order , just like women would ) and were gone . It amused him that these tiny women had handled that big boat . Which one had thrown the rope ? Who jumped onto the dock and secured the line ? He had not seen them clearly at all : just the hand and left side of one as she picked a bottle off the deck , and now their slim backs disappearinginto the darkness toward a jeep . He had not followed them . He did n't even know where they were off to . He waitedp134until the sea , the fish , the waves all shut up and the only sound came from the island . When he had eaten mustard , flat bread and the last of the bottled water he too disembarked but not before he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell sailors always swear they love . Behind him to his right the dim lights of Queen of France . Before him a dark shore . Ahead , under the stars and above the black of the beach he could barely see the hilly outline of the island against the sky . He walked along the dock and then . over forty feet of sand past the shadow of something that looked like a gasoline pump to the road the jeep had taken . He stayed on it and hoped he would n't meet anybody , for , having lost his shoes , he was not willing to cut through the bush , fat and tangled , by the side of the road . At every step clouds of mosquitoes surrounded him biting through his shirt and on the back of his neck . An old dread of mines chilled him  --  stopped him dead and he had to remind himself several times that this was the Caribbean  --  there were no beautiful pygmies in the trees or spring mines in the road . He had not followed the women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were going . He just walked for an hour on the only road there was and saw nothing to make him stop ; nothing that appeared to offer rest . At some point duringthat hour a foul smell rose about him . But the mosquitoes left him and he supposed it was the fumes coming from a marsh or swamp that he imagined he was passing through . When he emerged from it he saw above him a house with lights in its upper and lower stories . He stopped and rested one hand against a tree . How cool and civilized the house looked . After that hot solitary walk through darkness lined by trees muttering in their sleep , how cool , clean and civilized it looked . They are drinkingclear water in there , he thought , with ice cubes in it . He should have stayed on the boat for the night . But he 'd been shipbound so long and the land smell was so good , so good . " I 'd better go back , " he told himself . " Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bunk . " He drew his tongue across his lips and felt the cracks . Moving his hand an inch or two up the tree in preparation to go his fingers grazed a breast , the tight-to-breaking breast of a pubescent girl three months pregnant . He snatched his hand away and turned to look . Then he let his breath out in a snort that was more relief than laughter . An avocado was hanging from the tree right at his fingertips and near his cheek . He parted the leaves and stroked it . Saved , he thought . It smelled like an avocado , felt like an avocado . But suppose it was n't . Suppose it was a variety of ake , the fruit that contained both a pulp that was edible and a poison that killed . No , he thought , ake trees are bigger , taller and their fruit would not grow so close to the trunk . He strained to see the color , but could not . He decided not to chance it and looked again at the house lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him . Just then the wind , or perhaps it was the tree herself , lifted the leaves and , precisely as he had done a moment ago , parted wide the leaves . The avocado swung forward and touched his cheek . Why not ? he thought , and placed three fingers on either side of the fruit and bit it where it hung . Under the tough bitter skin was the completely tasteless , wholly satisfying meat and it made him thirstier than he was before . He had not followed the women . He had not even seen them clearly , only their slim backs . What he went toward the house for was a drink of water . To find an outside spigot ; a well , a fountain , anything to quench a thirst brought on by mosquitoes , the hot night and the meat of a teenaged avocado . He approached the house from its northern side , away from the gravel of the driveway and over where the grass was wet and silky under his feet . Through the first window he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not following the women ) but the piano . Nothing like Miss Tyler 's , but still a piano . It made him tired , weak and tired , as though he had swum seven seas for seven years only to arrive at the place he had started from :  |p136thirsty  , barefoot and alone . No water , no shipboard bunk , no ice cubes could fight the fatigue that overwhelmed him at the sight of the piano . He backed away , away from the light and the window into the protection of the trees that were still muttering in their sleep . He would have sunk where he stood and slept under the dreaming trees and the holy sky except for the part of him that never slept and which told him now what it always told him : to hide , to look for cover . So he obeyed the self that never blinked or yawned , and moved farther from the house looking for anything : a hutch , a toolshed , a cloister of shrubbery  --  and found a gazebo . He crawled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep did not join him there at once . What came , what entered the gazebo , what floated through the screen , were the boys who laughed at first when he used to go to Miss Tyler 's and teased him about fucking Andrew 's auntie when all he was doing was playing her piano , because there was n't another one in town except behind the altars of the A.M.E. Zion and Good Shepherd Baptist Church . Two churches for fewer than three hundred people . Drake , Soldier and Ernie Paul laughed and pointed their fingers . How it feel ? Is she good ? But he went anyway because she let him and because nothing else mattered . And after a while she said she would give him lessons if he would weed for her . And a year later Drake , Soldier and Ernie Paul were n't laughing ; they were sitting on Miss Tyler 's porch steps listening and waiting for him to come out . Cheyenne too listened while he played and waited out front for him . But that was much later and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake , Soldier and Ernie Paul . They kept him up all night , practically , so he thought they were probably alive somewhere . Each of them had been afraid for something different : his balls , eyes , spine . He had been afraid for his hands . All through the war he thought of sitting in a dark and smoky joint  --  a small place that could n't pack a hundred and could make it with a steady crowd of thirty  --  and him hidden behind the piano , surrounded and protected by the bass the drum the brass  --  takingp137eight once in a while but mostly letting his hands get to the crowd softly pleasantly . His hands would be doing something nice and human for a change . After he was busted  --  discharged without honor or humor  --  he had done it but so badly only the pity of the owner and the absence of a rival kept him there , playingat night while Cheyenne slept at home  --  waiting . He had not followed the women . He came to get a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the piano , slept all through the next day because Drake , Soldier and Ernie Paul kept him awake in the night . That 's how he came to sleep in the day and wander the property at night contrary to common sense and all notions of self-preservation . And he stayed tired . Even at night when he walked around looking for food and trying to think of what his next step should be . To go back to the boat and wait for one of them to sail it again . To examine the island and maybe find a rowboat  --  something anonymous  --  and make it to town at night . Get a little work , enough to fly to Miami and then work his way back home ? To knock on the door , ask for help and take the risk of being turned in . Each possibility seemed fine and each seemed stupid . But he was so tired in the day and so hungry at night , nothing was clear for days on end . Then he woke up , in a manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accident . The broken pantry window where he was accustomed to look for food and bottled water was boarded up . He tried the door and found it unlocked . He walked in . There in the moonlight was a basket of pineapples , one of which he rammed into his shirt mindless of its prickers . He listened a moment before opening the refrigeratordoor a crack . Its light cut into the kitchen like a wand . He shielded the opening as best he could while he reached inside . Three chicken wings were wrapped in wax paper . He took them all and closed the door . The silence was startling compared to the noisy night outside . He pushed the swinging doors and looked into a moonlit room with a big table in the middleand a chandelier overhead . It led to a hall which he enteredp138and which led to the front door which he opened and he stepped back outside . The chicken was incredible . He had n't tasted flesh since the day he went crazy with homesickness and jumped into the sea . He ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going right back and raiding the refrigerator again . Later . Wait till tomorrow night , he told himself . And he did . Each tomorrow night he entered the house and it was a week before he ventured upstairs and then it was out of curiosity as well as a sense of familiarity . The door of the first bedroom at the head of the stairs was open , the room itself , empty . The one to the left was not empty . A woman was sleeping in it . He meant to look but not to watch and not to stay because he had not followed the women . Had not even seen them clearly . So the first time he entered her room he stayed only a few seconds , watching her sleep . Anybody could have told him it was only the beginning . Considering the piano and - Cheyenne and this sleeping woman he was bound to extend his stay until he was literally spending the night with her gratified beyond belief to be sitting on the floor , his back against the wall , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find any ) , in the company of a woman asleep . His appetitefor her so gargantuan it lost its focus and spread to his eyes , the oranges in his shirt , the curtains , the moonlight . Spread to everything everywhere around her , and let her be . He spent some part of every night with her and grew to know the house well , for he sneaked out just before dawn when the kitchen came alive . And he had to admit now , standing in the sunlight , that he had liked living in the house that way . It became his , sort of . A nighttime possession complete with a beautifulsleeping woman . Little by little he learned the people . And little by little he forgot that he had not followed the women . He thought he had . Only now did he remember that it was the avocado , the thirst , the piano . And now here he was with the immediate plans of a newborn baby . He did n't like to think too far in advance anyway , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them about whop139he was and what his name was . Oh , he had been alone so long , hiding and running so long . In eight years he 'd had seven documentedidentities and before that a few undocumented ones , so he barely remembered his real original name himself . Actually the name most truly his was n't on any of the Social Security cards , union dues cards , discharge papers , and everybody who , , knew it or remembered it in connection with him could very well be dead . Son . It was the name that called forth the true him . The him that he never lied to , the one he tucked in at night and the one he did not want to die . The other selves were like the words he spoke  --  fabrications of the moment , misinformationrequired to protect Son from harm and to secure that one reality at least . THROUGH the window on the ground below he saw the back of a man stooping at some cutting or digging chore . It was the black man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at his back . Yardman , she called him . That was Yardman 's back . He knew backs , studied them because backs told it all . Not eyes , not hands , not mouths either , but backs because they were simply there , all open , unprotected and unmanipulable as Yardman'swas , stretched like a smokehouse cot where hobos could spend the night . A back where the pain of every canker , every pinched neck nerve , every toothache , every missed train home . empty mailbox , closed bus depot , do-not-disturb and this-seat taken sign since God made water came to rest . He watched the angle of the old man 's spine and for no reason that he could think of tears stung his eyes . It astonished him , those unshed tears , for he knew well the area into which his heart was careening  --  an area as familiar as the knuckle of his thumb . Not the street of yellow houses with white doors , but the wide lawn places where little boys in Easter white shorts played tennis under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to light their way , golden their hair and reflect the perfection of their Easter white shorts . He had fingered that image hundreds of times before andp140it had never produced tears . But now watching Yardman  --  he was kneeling , chopping at the trunk of a small tree  --  while he himself was so spanking clean , clean from the roots of his hair to the crevices between his toes , having watched his personal dirt swirl down a drain , while he himself stood wrapped waist-tothighin an Easter white towel  --  now he was as near to crying as he 'd been since he 'd fled from home . You would have thought something was leaving him and all he could see was its back . Slowly Yardman stood . He turned around toward the house and for less than a pulse beat glanced at the trees that grew at the edge of the courtyard . Then he lifted his cap , scratched his head with his ring and little finger , and pulled the cap back on . " Thanks , " whispered Son . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at last . " WHILE MARGARET had been lying in her sculptured bedroom , fighting hunger , anger and fear , Valerian was in his greenhouse staring out of the one glass window imagining what was not so : that the woman in the washhouse was bending over a scrub board rubbing pillow slips with a bar of orange Octagon soap . He knew perfectly well that a washer and dryer were installed there ( he could n't hear the hum , for the music and the drone of the air conditioner in the greenhouse obliterated it , but he could see the steam puffing from the exhaust pipe ) but the scrub board , the pillow slips and the orange soap were major parts of what he wished to see : the back yard of the house of his childhood in Philadelphia ; the hydrangea , fat and brown in the September heat . His father , knocked down by a horse-drawn milk truck , lay in bed , the house already funereal . Valerian went out back to the shed where a washerwoman did the family 's laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . Valerian sometimes visited her , or rather hung around her shed , asking questions and chattering . She was like a pet who would listen agreeably to him and not judge or give orders . The first time hep141came , she had said , by way of polite conversation  --  the pointless conversation of an adult without stature to a child who had some  --  " What your daddy doin today ? " And he had answered that his daddy was away on a sales trip to Atlantic City . From then on she greeted him that way . He would wander to the shed door and she would ask , " What your daddy doin today ? " and he would tell her , as a preliminary to the conversation , " He 's at the factory today " or " He 's in New York today . " It was a delightful opener to him because she and his father had never laid eyes on each other . A sort of grown-up conversation followed the question that they both took seriously . On one of the Wednesdaysshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Valerian was fussed over by his mother and relatives and then left alone while they busied themselves with death arrangements . He wandered out to the washhouse that afternoonand when the woman said , " Hi . What your daddy doin today ? " Valerian answered , " He 's dead today , " as though tomorrowhe would be something else . The woman looked up at him and paused for an awkward silence in which he suddenly understood the awfulness of what had happened and that his father would also be dead the next day and the day after that as well . In that instant , while the birdlike colored woman looked at him , he knew limitlessness . The infinity of days in which the answer to her question would be the same . " He 's dead today . " And each day it would be so . It was too big , too deep , a bottomless bucket of time into which his little boy legs were sinking and his little boy hands were floundering . Finally she blinked and pointed to a shelf behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he did . " Now unwrap it and stand right over here . Up close . Closer . " He did that too and she made him rub soap on the wet pillowcase that clung to the washboard . He scrubbed his heart out , crying all the while , pillowcase after pillowcase , rubbed and rubbed until his knuckles were cherry red and his arms limp with fatigue . And when he could not do another , she patted him on the head and said shep142would hire him any day . Later George , the butler they had before Sydney , found out about it ( he had wondered about those cherry-red knuckles ) and told him to stay out of there because that woman drank like a fish and he must n't let her use him to do her work . Valerian told him to mind his own " beeswax , " but they let the woman go and Valerian never again had to say , " He 's dead today , " but he said it anyway to himself until his little boy legs were strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no bottom . So , inconvenient as it was , he had insisted on a separate washhouse when he built L'Arbe de la Croix , less for an island touch than for the remembrance of having once done something difficult and important while the world was zooming away from him . Now another washerwomancame . It was n't quite the same . No Octagon soap , no wavy gleaming washboard , but he liked looking at it through his greenhouse window knowing there was a woman in there doing something difficult but useful in peace . A soothing thought to concentrate on while his own house was prickly with tension and unanswered questions . He had rattled last night to Jade . And why he had ascribed his exile to the Caribbean to the relationship between Margaret and Michael , he could n't imagine . The fact was he 'd become a stranger in his own city and chose not to spend his retirement there at exactly sixty-five ( or close to ) in order to avoid watchingit grow away from him . Sidewalks and thoroughfares were populated by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not know him ; familiar houses were bought by bright couples who either updated them or returned them to some era that existed only in their minds . They tore out unfashionable shrubbery for decks and patios ; they closed in the wide-open porches and enlarged windows that had been tiny , private and sweet . These new people privatized their houses by turning them backward away from the street , but publicized their lives and talked about wine as though it were a theology instead of a drink . The unending problem of growing old was not how hep143changed , but how things did . A condition bearable only so long as there were others like him to share that knowledge . But his wife , twenty-two years younger and from another place , did not remember , and his friends were dead and dying . In his heart he was still the thirty-nine-year-old Temple alumnus working in the candy factory about to assume from his uncles control of the company , and who had married a high school beauty queen he was determined to love in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that unlovable shrew who was unlovable to this very day . She had died a year before his retirementin South Carolina , where she had gone to live with her sister . When he heard about it , she was already in the ground . He began to miss her at precisely that point  --  terriblyandwhen he settled in the Caribbean she must have missed him too for she started visiting him in the greenhouse with the regularityof a passionate mistress . Funny . He could n't remember her eyes , but when she came , flitting around his chair and gliding over his seed flats , he recognized her at once . In nine years of marriage she had had two abortions and all she wanted to talk about during these visits was how relieved she was that she 'd had at least that foresight . He wished she felt something else . You 'd think in death , in the Beyond , she would have felt something else . Or nothing at all . He was not alarmed by her visits ; he knew he conjured them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood playmates who were clearer to him now than the last thirty years were , and nicer . But he was astonished to see  --  unconjured  --  his only living son in the dining room last night . Probably the consequenceof describing the sink business to Jade . Michael seemed to be smiling at him last night but not the smile of derision he usually had in the flesh ; this was a smile of reconciliation . And Valerian believed that was part of the reason he invited the black man to have a seat , the forepresence of Michael in the dining room . His face smiling at him from the bowl of peaches was both the winsome two-year-old under the sink and the thirty/year-old Socialist . The face in the peaches compelled him to dismiss Margaret 's screaming entrance as the tantrum of a spoiled child , the deliberate creation of a scene , which both father and son understood as feminine dementia . Michael had been on his heart if not in his mind since Margaret had announced the certainty of his visit . He could not say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael would come . That maybe this time there would be that feeling of rescue between them as it had been when he had taken him from underneath the sink . Thus when the black man appeared , Valerian was already in complicity with an overripe peach , and took on its implicit dare . And he invitedthe intruder to have a drink . The Michael of the reservationand the Michael of the sink was both surprised and pleased . It was easy not to believe in Margaret 's hysteria ; he had seen examples of it many times before and thought she was up to her old combo of masochism plus narcissism that he believed common to exceptionally beautiful women . But when , in a flash too speedy for reflex , he saw his entire household standing there , and in each of their faces disgust and horror , and all together triumphant , and all together anticipating his command , already acting on it in fact , just waiting for the signal from him to call the harbor police and thereby make him acknowledge his mistakein not taking Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment in a crisis , that he was wrong , that she was right , that his house had been violated and he neither knew it or believed it when it was discovered and it had been Sydney who had the foresight to have a gun and the legs to ferretout the intruder , when he saw Margaret 's triumphant face , Jade 's frightened one , and Sydney and Ondine looking at the prisoner with faces as black as his but smug , their manner struck him as what Michael meant when he said " bourgeois " in that tone that Valerian always thought meant unexciting , but now he thought meant false , but last night he thought meant Uncle Tom-ish . He had defended his servants vigorously to Michael then , with aphorisms about loyalty and decency and with shoutsp145that the press was ruining with typical carelessness the concept of honor for a people who had a hard enough time achieving any . What he had said to Jade , he believed : that Michael was a purveyor of exotics , a typical anthropologist , a cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pain . Valerian hated them , not from any hatred of the minority or alien culture , but because of what he saw to be the falseness and fraudulence of the anthropological position . The Indian problem , he told Michael , was between Indians , their conscience and their own derring-do . And all of his loving treks from ghetto to reservationto barrio to migrant farm were searches for people in whose company the Michaels could enjoy the sorrow they were embarrassed to feel for themselves . And yet , in the space of that flash he felt not only as Michael must have when he urged Jade to do something for her people ( no matter how silly his instruction ) , but something more . Disappointment nudging contempt for the outrage Jade and Sydney and Ondine exhibited in defendingproperty and personnel that did not belong to them from a black man who was one of their own . As the evening progressed , Valerian thoroughly enjoyed the disarray that his invitation had thrown them into . Margaret ran from the room  --  foiled . Jade was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked while the intruder himself did n't even look " caught . " He walked in with his hands raised and clasped behind his head and looked neither right nor left  --  not at Jade or Ondine or Margaret , but straight at Valerian and in his eyes was neither a question nor a plea . And no threat whatsoever . Valerian was not afraid then and he was not afraid atnoon the next day , when Sydney tapped quietly on his door and brought his mail and his baked potato . Valerian could sense the small waiting in Sydney , some expectation or hope that his employer would give him a hint of what had been in his head last night . Valerian felt a twinge of compassion for him , but since he could not tell him about faces that looked up out of peaches , he said nothing at all . Actually he had no plans . He was curious about the man , butp146not all that much . He assumed he was what he 'd said he was : a crewman jumping ship , and his roaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , was more outrageous than threatening . He had looked into the man 's eyes and had no fear . Digesting his potato and sipping wine , he was rewarded for his serenity by an expansive " Howdy " followed by the entrance of the stranger wrapped in a woman 's kimono , barefoot with gleamingwrought-iron hair . Valerian let his eyes travel cautiously down from the hair to the robe to the naked feet . The man smiled broadly . He looked down at himself , back at Valerian and said , " But I do n't do no windows . " Valerian laughed , shortly . " Good morning , Mr. Sheek , " said the man . " Street . Valerian Street , " said Valerian . " What did you say your name was ? " " Green . William Green . " " Well , good morning ; , Villie . Sleep well ? " " Yes , sir . Best sleep I ver had . Your name really Valerian ? " " Yes . " Valerian shrugged helplessly and smiled . " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Valerian . " Our candy company made them . " " No kiddin ? You named after a candy ? " " The candy was named after me . I was named after an emperor . " Oh , " said the man looking around the greenhouse . Its sudden coldness was delicious after the heat outside . Shady and cool with plants shooting from pots and boxes everywhere . " It 's sho pretty in here , " he said , still smiling . " Tell me the truth , " said Valerian , " before you get confused by what you see . What were you really doing in my wife 's bed-room ? " The man stopped smiling . " The truth ? " He looked down at the brick walk in some embarrassment . " The truth is I made a mistake . I thought it was the other one . "  | " What other one ? " " The other bedroom . " " Jade 's ? " " Yes , sir . I uh thought I smelled oyster stew out back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . They done left the kitchen and I thought 1 'd try to get me some , but before I knew it I heard them coming back . I could n't run out the back door so I run through another one . It was a dinin room . I ran upstairs into the first room I seen . When I got in I seen it was a bedroom but thought it belonged to the one y'all call Jade . I aimed to hide there till I could get out , but then I heard somebody comin and I ducked into the closet . I was just as scared as your wife was when she opened that door and turned that light on me . " " You 've been skulking around here for days . Why did n't you ask at the kitchen for something to eat ? " " Scared . I ai n't got a passport , I told you . You going to turn me over to the police ? " " Well , not in that get-up certainly . " " Yeah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd give me life . I do n't reckon you have an old suit to lend me ? Then I can go to jail in style . " " In one of my suits they 'd make you governor . I 'll tell Sydney to find something for you . But do n't be surprised if he bites your head off . " Suddenly the man jumped and stamped his feet on the bricks . " What 's the matter ? " " Ants , " he said . " Oh dear . You 've let them in , and I 'm out of thalomide . " Valerian stood up . " Over there , that can . Spray the doorsill . It wo n't do much good , but it will help for a while , and tuck that muslin in tighter . " The man did as he was told and then said , " You ought to get mirrors . " Mirrors for what ? " " Put outside the door . They wo n't come near a mirror . "  | " Really ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ant killer on his legs . His kimono came undone at the belt and fell away from his body . Valerian looked at his genitals and the skinny black thighs . " You ca n't go round like that in front of the ladies . Leave that alone , and go tell Sydney to give you some clothes . Tell him I said so . " The man looked up letting the kimono hang to his sides . " You ai n't gon na turn me in ? " " I guess not . You did n't take anything , but we 'll have to figure a way to get you some papers . Go on now . Get some clothes . " Valerian took the ant spray and set it down near a heavy plant of many shades of green . Its leaves spread out healthily and long stems stood straight up among them . Stems with closed buds . Valerian peered into the plant and frowned . " What 's the matter with it ? " asked the man . " Looks sick . " Valerian turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . It 's been in bud like that for I do n't know how long . They wo n't open no matter what I do . " " Shake it , " said the man . " They just need jacking up . " And he walked over to the cyclamen and with thumb and middle finger flicked the stems hard as though they were naughty students . " What the hell are you doing ? " Valerian reached out to grab the man 's hand . " Do n't worry . They 'll be in bloom tomorrow morning . " " If they are I 'll buy you a brand-new suit ; if they die I 'll have Sydney chase you back into the sea . " " Deal ! " said the man . " I know all about plants . They like women , you have to jack them up every once in a while . Make em act nice , like they 're supposed to . " He finished flicking the cyclamen stems and smiled first to himself and then at Valerian . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went to heaven ? " " No , " said Valerian . " Tell me . " And he did and it was a goodp149joke . Very funny and when Jadine ran to the greenhouse certain the noise coming from it was somebody murdering somebody she heard laughter to beat the band . SYDNEY had put some of his boss 's old clothes in the guest room for him , and Valerian sent him off with Gideon to get a haircut , because Sydney refused flat out to cut it . Valerian half expected the man would get into town and not return , since he had given him enough money to buy some underwear and some shoes that fit him better than his did . While Valerian had dinner alone that night served by a silent steeping butler , and while Margaret pouted in her room and Jadine ate with Ondine in the kitchen , Mr. Green alias Son drifted off with Gideon and Therese in the Prix de France . With country people 's pride in a come-from-far guest , they paraded the American Negro through the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends to give them a free taxi ride to the outskirts of town , and then they had to walk and walk and walk up into the hills to Place de Vent before they reached the powder pink house where he lived with Therese and , sometimes , Alma Estee . Therese was in ecstasy and kept moving her head about the better to see him out of her broken eyes . As soon as they had got ashore she let it be known to every island Black she saw that they had a guest , a visitor from the States , and that he was going to spend the night . Her pride and her message ran all over the streets and up the hillside , and at various times during the evening , heads poked in her doorway , and neighbors dropped by on some pretense or other . Therese sent Alma Estee flying back down the hill to the market for a packet of brown sugar , and she went into the bag that hung by her side under her dress for money for goat meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listened to the men talk and waited her turn . Gideon told her stories on Isle des Chevaliers , but here at home he did not socialize with her  --  he kept to himself or spentp150his free time with old cronies . Only at work on the island of the rich Americans did he entertain her . Now she was to be privy to the talk between them , and in her house at that . She would also have a chance to ask the American Black herself whether it was really so that American women killed their babies with their fingernails . She waited until Gideon had cut his hair with clippershe 'd borrowed from the man who sold rum . Waited until great clouds of glittering graphite hair fell to the floor and on the bedspread they had wrapped around the man 's neck and the front of his whole body . Waited until Gideon was through with his boasts about when he was in the States , boasts about the nurse he had married , the hospital he had worked in , the hatefulnessof that nurse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the money he made there and why he returned home . Waited until the stranger who ate chocolate and drank bottled water was properly shorn and his neck dusted with baking soda , and Alma Estee was back and the meat was frying on the two-burner stove . Waited till they ate it and drank coffee loaded with sugar . Waited till they opened the bottle of rum and the chocolate eater had coughed like a juvenile with his first taste of it . Therese served the two men but did not eat with them . Instead she stood at the portable stove burning the hair she had swept up from the floor , burning it carefully and methodicallywith many glances at the chocolate eater to show him she meant him no evil . When they had eaten and Therese had grown accustomed to the rhythm of their guest 's English , she joined them at the table . Alma Estee sat on the cot by the window . Son smoked Gideon 's cigarettes and poured the rest of the rum into his coffee . He stretched his legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postures and phony accents . The tough goat meat , the smoked fish , the pepper-hot gravy over the rice settled in him . It had been served all on one plate and he knew what the delicacies had cost them : the sweet , thick cookies , the canned milk and especially the rum . Thep151nakedness of his face and head made him vulnerable , but his hosts gave him adoration to cover it . Alma Estee had taken off her short print dress and returned in her best clothes  --  a school uniform  --  but Son knew right away that she had not had school tuition for a long time now . The uniform was soiled and frayed . He could feel her waves of desire washing over him and for the first time in years he felt like a well-heeled man . Therese urged him on into a feast of plantain and fried avocado , then leaned toward him in the lamplight , her broken eyes cheerful , and asked him , " Is it true ? American women reach into their wombs and kill their babies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gideon said to her , and then to Son , " She 's gone stupid as well as blind . " He explained to Son that he used to tell her what working in an American hospital was like . About free abortions and D &; C 's . The scraping of the womb . But that Therese had her own views of understanding that had nothing to do with the world 's views . That however he tried to explain a blood bank to her , or an eye bank , she always twisted it . The word " bank , " he thought , confused her . And it was true . Therese said America was where doctors took the stomachs , eyes , umbilical cords , the backs of the neck where the hair grew , blood , sperm , hearts and fingers of the poor and froze them in plastic packages to be sold later to the rich . Where childrenas well as grown people slept with dogs in their beds . Where women took their children behind trees in the park and sold them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that even the priests were women . Where for a bar of gold a doctor could put you into a machine and , in a matter of minutes , would change you from a man to a woman or a woman to a man . Where it was not uncommon or strange to see people with both penises and breasts . " Both , " she said , " a man 's parts and a woman 's on the same person , yes ? " " Yes , " said Son.  | " And they grow food in pots to decorate their houses ? Avocado and banana and potato and limes ? " Son was laughing . " Right , " he said . " Right . " " Do n't encourage her , man , " said Gideon . " She 's a mean one and one of the blind race . You ca n't tell them nothing . They love lies . " Therese said she was not of that race . That the blind race lost their sight around forty and she was into her fifties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Gideon started to tease her about being " into her fifties . " Sixties , more like , he said , and she had faked sight so long she did n't remember herself when she started to go blind . Son asked who were the blind race so Gideon told him a story about a race of blind people descended from some slaves who went blind the minute they saw Dominique . A fishermen 's tale , he said . The island where the rich Americans lived is named for them , he said . Their ship foundered and sank with Frenchmen , horses and slaves aboard . The blinded slaves could not see how or where to swim so they were at the mercy of the current and the tide . They floated and trod water and ended up on that island along with the horses that had swum ashore . Some of them were only partially blinded and were rescued later by the French , and returned to Queen of France and indenture . The others , totally blind , hid . The ones who came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went blind too . What they saw , they saw with the eye of the mind , and that , of course , was not to be trusted . Therese , he said , was one such . He himself was not , since his mother and Therese had different fathers . Son felt dizzy . The cheap rum and the story together made his head light . " What happened to the ones who hid on the island ? Were they ever caught ? " " No , man , still there , " said Gideon . " They ride those horses all over the hills . They learned to ride through the rain forestp153avoiding all sorts of trees and things . They race each other , and for sport they sleep with the swamp women in Sein de Veilles . Just before a storm you can hear them screwing way over here . Sounds like thunder , " he said , and burst into derisive laughter . Son laughed too , then asked , " Seriously , did anybody ever see one of them ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them without their permission . No telling what they 'll do if they know you saw them . " " We thought you was one , " said Therese . " She thought , " said Gideon . " Not me . Personally I think the blindness comes from second-degree syphilis . " Therese ignored this remark . " I was the one made him leave the window that way . So you could get the food , " said Therese . " You did that ? " Son smiled at her . Therese tapped her chest bone with pride . " Miss Therese , love of my life , I thank you from the bottom of my heart . " Son took her hand and kissed the knuckles . Therese shrieked and cackled with happiness . " I said you would n't ask machete-hair for anything , so I left food for you in the washhouse . You never came for it . " " Machete-hair ? The cook ? " " That one . That devil . The one I almost drown myself for twice a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get there . " " Do n't listen to her . She knows those waters just like the fishermen . She does n't like the Americans for meanness . Just because they a little snooty sometimes . I get along with them okay . When they say to let Therese go , I say okay . But I bring her right back and tell them it 's a brand-new woman . " " They do n't know ? " " Not yet . They do n't pay her any attention . " Stimulated by the hand kiss , Therese wanted to ask more questions about the women who clawed their wombs , but Gideonp154grew loud and stopped her . " She was a wet-nurse , " he told Son , " and made her living from white babies . Then formula came and she almost starve to death . Fishing kept her alive . " " Enfamil ! " said Therese , banging her fist on the table . " How can you feed a baby a thing calling itself Enfamil . Sounds like murder and a bad reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I got milk to this day ! " " Go way , woman , who wants to hear about your wretched teats . Go on out of here . " Gideon shooed her and she left the table but not the room . When she was quiet , Gideon waved his arm about the house and told Son , " You welcome here any time you want . " His arm took in the cot where Therese slept at night , the floor where Alma Estee sometimes slept and the tiny bedroom where he did . Son nodded . " Thanks . " " I mean it . Any time . Not much life going on over there . Maybe you could find work here . Plenty work here and you young . Son sipped rum-laced coffee wondering why , if there was plenty work there , Gideon was n't doing any of it . " How long have you been working over there ? " " Three years steady now . Off and on before . They used to come seasonal . " " Did you become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I marry that crazy nurse woman ? Got a passport and everything . But , listen , I do n't let on over there that I can read . Too much work they give you . Instructions about how to install this and that . I make out that I ca n't read at all . " " You 've been away so long , you must have lost your citizenship by now . " Gideon shrugged . " The U.S. is a bad place to die in , " he said . He did n't regret it . The only thing he regretted was his unemployment insurance . A marvelous , marvelous thing , thatp155was . You had to hand it to the U.S. They knew how to make money and they knew how to give it away . The most generous people on the globe . Now the French were as tight as a virgin , but the Americans , ahhh . After a while they were quiet . Therese was breathing heavily so Son thought she was asleep . He could not see her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You going back ? " asked Gideon , " to the island ? " " I do n't know . " " You want to get in there , do n't you , eh ? That yalla ? " Gideon stroked his chin . " Man , " said Son . " Oh , man . " He said it with enthusiasm but he put a period in his voice too . He did n't want her chewed over by Gideon 's stone-white teeth . Did n't want her in Gideon 's mind , his eye . It unnerved him to think that Gideon had looked at her at all . The old man beard the period in his voice and turned the conversation to serious advice . " Your first yalla ? " he asked . " Look out . It 's hard for them not to be white people . Hard , I 'm telling you . Most never make it . Some try , but most do n't make it . " " She 's not a yalla , " said Son . " Just a little light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black folk . " Do n't fool yourself . You should have seen her two months ago . What you see is tanning from the sun . Yallas do n't come to being black natural-like . They have to choose it and most do n't choose it . Be careful of the stuff they put down . " " I 'll be careful . " " Come on , " said Gideon . " Let 's go see some of the boys . Let me show you this place . Paradise , boy . Paradise . " They got up to leave and Alma Estee sprang into life . She stood near the door and stretched out her hand . Son stopped and smiled at her . " You think , " she said whispering , " you think you can send top156America for me and buy me a wig ? I have the picture of it . " And she pulled from the pocket of her school blazer a folded picture which she tried her best to show him before Gideon pushed her away . " TARZAN mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickey Freeman and a little Paco Rabanne could do . He held the jacket by his forefinger over his shoulder . With the other hand he struck the keys . Jadine was startled . In a white shirt unbuttoned at the cuffs and throat , and with a gentle homemade haircut , he was gorgeous . He had preserved his mustache but the kinky beard was gone along with the chain-gang hair . " If I were wearing Tarzan 's suit , " she said , " I 'd show a little respect . " " That 's why I asked . I 'm showing respect . " " Then ask him yourself , " she answered , and turned to leave . She had been sitting in the living room after lunch waiting for Margaret when he entered and stood at the piano . She was impressedand relieved by his looks , but his behavior in her bedroom was uppermost in her mind . " Wait , " he said . " I want to talk to you  --  apologize . I 'm sorry about yesterday . " " Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't forgive me ? " he asked . Jadine stopped and turned around . " Uh-uh . " " Why not ? " He stayed near the piano but looked directly at her , the question apparently important to him . Jadine took a few steps toward him . " I do n't have to explain anything to you . " " But I said I 'm sorry . You can figure out why I did it , ca n't you ? You were so clean standing in that pretty room , and I was so dirty . I was ashamed kinda so I got mad and tried to dirty you . That 's all , and I 'm sorry . "  | " Okay . You 're sorry you did it ; I 'm sorry you did it . Let 's just drop it . " She turned around once more . " Wait . " " What for ? " " I want to play you something . " He tossed his jacket on the piano lid and sat down on the stool . " Would you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a living ? " He played a chord , then another and tried a whole phrase , but his fingers would not go where he directed them . Slowly he took his hands away from the keys and stared at them . " Could n't have been much of a living , " she said . " It was n't . I could barely keep up with the drums when I was cookin my best . Now  --  " He turned his hands over and looked up at her with a very small smile . " Maybe I 'll just do the melody . " I Ie tapped out a line . " I do n't like what you did , hear ? So do n't play any songs for me . " " Hard , " he said without looking up . " Hard , hard lady . " " Right . " " Okay . I quit . I just wanted to tell you I was sorry , and that you do n't have to be nervous anymore . " " I 'm not nervous , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad . " " Or mad either . " She walked toward him now and leaned an elbow on the piano , her thumbnail pressed into her bottom teeth . " I suppose Valerian invited you to stay for Christmas ? " " Did he ? " " Did n't he ? " " I do n't know . I just got back this minute . " Jadine stepped away from the piano and looked out the slidingglass doors . " He was carrying on this morning about some flower you made bloom . " " Oh , that . He has n't got enough wind in there . It needed shaking . "  | " You some sort of fanner ? " " No . Just a country boy . " " Well , listen , country boy , my aunt and uncle are upset . You go and apologize to them . Their name is Childs . Sydney and Ondine Childs . I had to throw the pajamas you left in my bathroomout the window so they would n't see them . You do n't have to apologize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you apologize to them . " " All right , " he said , and she sure did look it  --  like she could take care of herself . He did not know that all the time he tinkled the keys she was holding tight to the reins of dark dogs with silver feet . For she was more frightened of his good looks than she had been by his ugliness the day before . She watched him walk away saying " See you later " and thought that two months in that place with no man at all made even a river rat look good . There was no denying the fact that looking at his face and keepingher voice stern required some concentration . Spaces , mountains , savannas  --  all those were in his forehead and eyes . Too many art history courses , she thought , had made her not perceptivebut simpleminded . She saw planes and angles and missed character . Like the vision in yellow  --  she should have known that bitch would be the kind to spit at somebody , and now this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original insult . She wanted to sketch him and get it over with , but when she thought of trying to lay down that space and get the eagle beak of his nose , she got annoyed with herself . And did he have a cleft in his chin ? Jadine closed her eyes to see it better , but could n't remember . She left the room and climbed the stairs quickly . Christmas will be over soon . She had called Air France just as she promised Margaret she would , but she also made a reservation for herself for December 28 , standby . Just in case . This winter retreat thing was running out anyway . She had not accomplished anything , was more at loose ends here than anywhere . At least in Paris there was work , excitement . She thought she had better go to New York , do this job , and then return top159Paris and Ryk . The idea of starting a business of her own , she thought , was a fumble . Valerian would lend her the money , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a silly age , twenty-five ; too old for teenaged dreaming , too young for settling down . Every corner was a possibility and a dead end . Work ? At what ? Marriage ? Work and marriage ? Where ? Who ? What can I do with this degree ? Do I really want to model ? It was nothing like she thought it would be : soft and lovely smiles in soft and lovely clothes . It was knife hard and everybody frowned and screamed all the time , and if ever she wanted to paint a predatoryjungle scene she would use the faces of the people who bought the clothes . She was bored and no more together than the river rat . She kept calling him that . River rat . Sydney called him swamp nigger . What the hell did he say his name was and even if she could remember it would she say it out loud withoutreaching for the leash ? SON WENT immediately from the living room piano to the kitchen and , finding it empty , walked down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steps and noticed a door on the landing to the short flight of stairs separating the kitchens . He rapped shortly and a voice said , " Yes ? " He opened the door . " Mrs. Childs ? " Ondine was soaking her feet in a basin . At first she thought it was Yardman . He alone on the island called her that . Even the Filipinos over at the nearest house called her Ondine . But the clean-shaven man in the doorway was not Yardman . " Jadine said it was all right if I came to see you , " he said . " What you want ? " " To apologize . I did n't mean to scare everybody . " Son did not allow himself a smile . " Well , I 'd hate to think what would be the case if you had meant to . "  | " I was a little off . From not eating . Drove me a little nuts , ma'am . " " You could have asked , " Ondine said . " You could have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , but I 'm , like , an outlaw . I jumped ship . I could n't take a chance and I stayed too hungry to think . I was in a little trouble back in the States too . I 'm , you know , just out here trying to hang in . " " What kind of trouble ? " " Car trouble . Wrecked a car , and could n't pay for it . No insurance , no money . You know . " Ondine was watching him closely . Sitting in a chintz rocker , rubbing one foot against the other in an Epsom salt solution . The difference between this room and the rest of the house was marked . Here were second-hand furniture , table scarves , tiny pillows , scatter rugs and the smell of human beings . It had a tacky permanence to it , but closed . Closed to outsiders . No visitors ever came in here . There were no extra chairs ; no display of teaset . Just the things they used , Sydney and Ondine , and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee table . Worn house slippers to the left of the door . Photographs of women with their legs crossed at the ankles and men standing behind wicker chairs , touching them lightly with their fingers . Groups of people standing on stairs . One blue-tinted photograph of a man with magnificent handlebar mustaches . All-dressed-up black people of some earlier day who looked like they had serious business at hand . Ondine sensed his absorption of her apartment . " Not as grand , I suppose , as where you sleep . " Now he did smile . " Too grand , " he said . " Much too grand for me . I feel out of place there . " " I should n't wonder . " " I want to apologize to your husband too . Is he here ? " " He 'll be back in a minute . " Son thought she sounded like the single woman who answersp161the door and wants the caller to think there is a huge , tough male in the next room . " I 'll be gone soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has friends in town , he says . " She looked skeptical . " But even if he does n't , I 've got to make tracks . I just do n't want you upset or worried . I did n't come here for no harm . " " Well , I 'm more inclined to believe you now that you had a bath . You was one ugly something . " " I know . Do n't think I do n't know it . " " You went off with Yardman yesterday ? " It bothered him that everybody called Gideon Yardman , as though he had not been mothered . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " Mr. Street told me to . I spent the night there . I started to just stay on there , since that 's where I was heading for in the first place . But I did n't want to leave without making peace with you all . My own mama would n't forgive me for that . " " Where is your own mama ? " " Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my sister and me . But I do n't know if he 's alive still . " Ondine saw the orphan in him and rubbed her feet together . " What line of work you in ? " " I 've been at sea off and on for eight years . All over . Dry cargo mostly . Wrecks . " " Married ? " " Yes , ma'am , but she leave Florida , before they threw me in jail . That 's when I started fooling around on docks . " " Huh . " " What 's the matter with your feet , Mrs. Childs ? " " Tired . Stand on any feet for thirty years and they might talk back . " " You should put banana leaves in your shoes . Better'n Dr. Scholl 's . " " Is that so ? "  | " Yeah . Want me to get you some ? " " I 'll get em if I want to . Later on . " " Well , I 'll leave you alone now , " and he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like lightning as soon as he saw who was standing there talking to his wife . " What are you doing in my place ? " Ondine held up a hand . " He came to apologize , Sydney . " Son moved aside so he would not be standing between them and said , " Yes , sir . . . " " Anything you got to say to me or my wife , you say it somewhere else . Do n't come in here . You are not invited in here . " " It was Jadine , " Son began . " She suggested . . . " " Jadine ca n't invite you in here , only I can do that . And let me tell you something now . If this was my house , you would have a bullet in your head . Right there . " And he pointed to a spot between Son 's eyebrows . " You can tell it 's not my house because you are still standing upright . But this here is . " He pointed a finger at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I was surprised as anybody when he told me to stay  --  " Sydney interrupted him again . " You have been lurking around here for days , and a suit and a haircut do n't change that . " " I 'm not trying to change it . I 'm trying to explain it . I was in some trouble and left my ship . I could n't just knock on the door . " " Do n't hand me that mess . Save it for people who do n't know better . You know what I 'm talking about , you was upstairs ! " " I was wrong , okay ? I took to stealing food and started wanderingaround in here . I got caught , okay ? I 'm guilty of being hungryand I 'm guilty of being stupid , but nothing else . He knows that . Your boss knows that , why do n't you know it ? " " Because you are not stupid and because Mr. Street do n't know nothing about you , and do n't care nothing about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all , inviting you to dinner . He do n't give a damn what it does to anybodyp163else . You think he cares about his wife ? That you scared his wife ? If it entertained him , he 'd hand her to you ! " " Sydney ! " Ondine was frowning . " It 's true ! " " You know him all this time and you think that ? " she asked him . " You tell me , " he answered . " You ever see him worry over her ? " Ondine did not answer . " No . You do n't . And he do n't worry over us neither . What he wants is for people to do what he says do . Well , it may be his house , but I live here too and I do n't want you around ! " Sydney turned back to Son , pointing at him again . " Mr. Childs , " Son spoke softly , but clearly , " you do n't have to be worried over me either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does worry me . You had a job , you chucked it . You got in some trouble , you say , so you just ran off . You hide , you live in secret , underground , surfacewhen you caught . I know you , but you do n't know me . I am a Phil-a-delphia Negro mentioned in the book of the very same name . My people owned drugstores and taught school while yours were still cutting their faces open so as to be able to tell one of you from the other . And if you looking to lounge here and live off the fat of the land , and if you think I 'm going to wait on you , think twice ! He 'll lose interest in you faster than you can blink . You already got about all you can out ' of this place : a suit and some new shoes . Do n't get another idea in your head . " " I 'm leaving , Mr. Childs . He said he 'd help me get a visasomething  --  so I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need no visa to go home . You a citizen , ai n't you ? " " Well , I use another name . I mean I do n't want nobody checking me out . " " Take my advice . Clean your life up . " Son sighed . He had told six people in two days all about him/self . Had talked more about himself than he had in years and told each of them as much of the truth as he had to . Sydney , he knew from the start , would be the hardest to convince . But he kept calling him Mr. Childs and sir and allowing in gesture as how he was a reprobate , and ended by asking them both if they knew somewhere else he could sleep while he waited for Mr. Street to get the visa and some identification for him . Outside if need be , he said . It would just be one more night , he thought , and he did n't feel comfortable up there on the second floor . The couple exchanged glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the patio outside the kitchen they could fix something up for him . " I 'd appreciate it , " Son said . " And would you do me one more favor ? Could you let me eat in the kitchen with you all ? " They nodded , and Son left quickly , pleased , rather , that Sydney thought he was interested in Valerian 's generosity . THE HOUSE locked back together that evening and busied itself for Christmas . In Ondine 's kitchen Son ate so much of her food she softened considerably toward him . Sydney was less accommodatingthan his wife , but he could not doubt the man 's hunger and his ways were quiet and respectful , almost erasing the memory of that " Hi . " By the time they finished eating and reminiscing about the States , Sydney was calling him Son . Valerian and Margaret and Jadine had eaten together in the dining room earlier , Sydney serving regally . Margaret was mollifiedby two telephone calls and a window view of the man who 'd been in her closet which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was harmless . At any rate , he was not sleeping upstairs , she 'd been informed by Jadine , nor eating with them , and maybe Michael would enjoy him if he was still on the property then . Especially if B.J. did n't show . The travel agency said the ticket had not been picked up yet . She tried to hang on to her despair about Valerian , but it was hopeless . He was tickled top165death by the sight of four cyclamen blossoms , so happy he was considering putting down mirrors for the ants . He 'd gone around all morning beating up other plants , especially his miniature orange trees which had come with no blossoms or fruit . He had even drafted a letter to the consulate asking whether a B-class visa could be arranged for a local employee of his . And he spoke of Michael 's visit as though it were a reality . They were amiable that evening . Relaxed . Valerian cracked jokes that were not funny back in the fifties . Margaret chattered and thought up extra niceties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas dinner herself . It was to be a really old-fashioned Christmas , and that required the woman of the house to be bustling in the kitchen with an apron roasting turkey and baking apple pies . Valerian should call the consulate . They would have some apples ; they always got Americanproduce . Valerian said she 'd never made a crust in her life and he was n't looking forward to an experiment at Christmas . But Margaret would n't listen . She was hyper and happy : Michael was on his way . Valerian thought she had gone hogwildthis time  --  but her cheer cheered him and he encouraged rather than spoiled it . The quiet amiability lasted the whole evening and there was rest in everybody 's sleep that night . Except Son 's . He was swingingin a hammock outside in the night wind with that woman on his mind . He had managed a face for everybody but her . The others were seduced by the Hickey Freeman suit and the haircut , but she was not and neither was he . Not seduced at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he always knew what he was like . The soldier ants were not out in the night wind , neither were the bees . But heavy clouds grouped themselves behind the hills as though for a parade . You could almost see the herd assemble but the man swinging in the hammock was not aware of them . He was dwelling on his solitude , rocking in the wind , adrift . A man without human rites : unbaptized , uncircumcised , minusp166puberty rites or the formal rites of manhood . Unmarried and undivorced . He had attended no funeral , married in no church , raised no child . Propertyless , homeless , sought for but not after . There were no grades given in his school , so how could he know when he had passed ? He used to want to go down in blue water , down , down , then to rise and burst from the waves to see before him a single hard surface , a heavy thing , but intricate . He would enclose it , conquer it , for he knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it too that it did not consider him able . The conflict between knowing his power and the world 's opinion of it secluded him , made him unilateral . But he had chosen solitude and the company of other solitary people  --  opted for it when everybody else had long ago surrendered , because he never wanted to live in the world their way . There was something wrong with the rites . He had wanted another way . Some other way of being in the world that he felt leaving him when he stood in the white towel watching Yardman 's  --  Gideon 's  --  back . But something had come loose in him , like the ball that looped around the roulette wheel , carried as much by its own weight as by the force of the wheel . In those eight homeless years he had joined that great underclassof undocumented men . And although there were more of his kind in the world than students or soldiers , unlike students or soldiers they were not counted . They were an international legion of day laborers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crewmen on ships with volatile cargo , part-time mercenaries , full-time gigolos , or curbside musicians . What distinguished them from other men ( aside from their terror of Social Security cards and cedula de identidad ) was their refusal to equate work with life and an inability to stay anywhere for long . Some were Huck Finns ; some Nigger Jims . Others were Calibans , Staggerlees and John Henrys . Anarchic , wandering , they read about their hometowns in the pages of out-of-town newspapers.  |p167Since  1 971 Son had been seeing the United States through the international edition of Time , by way of shortwave radio and the views of other crewmen . It seemed sticky . Loud , red and sticky . Its fields spongy , its pavements slick with the blood of all the best people . As soon as a man or woman did something generous or said something bold , pictures of their funeral lines appeared in the foreign press . It repelled him and made him suspicious of all knowledge he could not witness or feel in his bones . When he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican drew in Uncle Sam 's mouth : a map of the U.S. as an ill-shaped tongue ringed by teeth and crammed with the corpses of children . The Mexican had presented it to him with a smile the day Son bashed the snapper 's head in . " Americano , " said the Mexican , and handed him the picture that he 'd drawn in prison and kept in his locker . They were close to Argentina and had been fishing off the prow that morning , pulling in snapper so rapidly they seemed to be leaping onto the deck . All but Son . The Swede and the Mexican  --  the two he was closest to  --  laughed at his spectacular bad luck . Suddenly a bite and he reeled in a huge glitter of froth and steel . The friends watched admiringly as the fish flopped into death . But when Son bent down to remove the hook , the fish executed a dazzling final arc three feet above the deck and slapped his face . The Mexican and the Swede laughed like children , and Son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist the snapper 's head . The mouth pulped and a little eye skittered across the deck . The Swede roared but the Mexican was suddenly quiet , and later handed him the drawing saying , " Americano . Cierto Americano . Es verdad , " and maybe it was so . In any case , if he was punchingdying fish in anger , if he was pricked to fury by the outrageousclaim of a snapper on its own life , stunned by its refusal to cooperate with his hook , to want , goddamn it , to surrender itself for his pleasure , then perhaps he was cierto Americano and it was time to go home . Not to the sticky-red place , but top168his home in it . That separate place that was presided over by wide black women in snowy dresses and was ever dry , green and quiet . There were n't going to be any impalas or water buffalo ; no mating dance , no trophies . There was dice instead of tusk ; a job when he wanted a journey . And the lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was frozen in stone ( can you beat it ? ) in front of the New York Public Library in a city that had laughed at his private 's uniform . Like an Indian seeing his profile diminished on a five-cent piece , he saw the things he imagined to be his , including his own reflection , mocked . Appropriated , marketed and trivialized into decor . He could not give up the last thing left to him  --  fraternity . On the ocean and in lockups he had it ; in tiny bars and shape-up halls he had it , and if he was becoming cierto Americano , he 'd better go where he could never be deprived of it  --  home . He wanted to go home but that woman was on his mind . The one whose dreams he had tried to change and whom he had insulted to keep her unhinging beauty from afflicting him and keeping him away from home . She is on my mind , he thought , but I am not on hers . What must it be like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know was to find out . The next morning he asked her if she would like to eat lunch with him down on the beach , and she said , " Sure , I want to sketch down there before I go , anyway . " It surprised him into awkwardness and the word " go " sent a ripple through him , exacerbating the awkwardness . She was getting ready to leave ? Go somewhere ? They took the Willys and she drove , saying almost nothing . She sat quietly under the wheel in an expertly crushed white cotton halter and a wide , wide skirt that rich people called " peasant " and peasants called " wedding , " her skin damp and glowing against the Easter white cotton  --  all temptation and dare . When they got to the dock and parked , she jumped out with her sketch pad and box of pencils . He followed her with thep169basket for she was leading the way  --  making little prints in the hard-packed sand . They walked about half a mile to a bend of good clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and she took off her canvas shoes . It was after they ate that carelessly assembled , hurriedly packed lunch that she seemed really aware of him but only because she was opening her sketch pad and fiddling with the wooden box of pencils . She examined him then with an intent but distant eye and asked him a casual question which he answered by saying , " My original dime . That 's all . My original dime . " The sun was hiding from them and the mosquitoes were held off by a burning can of commercialrepellent . The olives , French bread , uncuttable cheese , ham slices , jar of black mushy cherries and wine left them both as hungry as they were when they started . It was a deliberately unappetizing lunch which she had literallydumped into a beautiful brown and purple Haitian basket as though to disabuse him of any idea that this was a real picnic or that it was important to her . But they ate it all up and wished for more . It was probably that yearning for more that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of life ? " A tiresome question of monumental ordinariness , the kind artists ask models while they measure the distance between forehead and chin but one which he had apparently given some thought to . " My original dime , " he said . " The one San Francisco gave me for cleaning a tub of sheephead . " He was half sitting , half lying , propped upon his elbow facing her with the sky-blue sky of the sky behind him . " Nothing I ever earned since was like that dime , " he said . " That was the best money in the world and the only real money I ever had . Even better than the seven hundred and fifty dollars I won one time at craps . Now that felt good , you know what I mean , but not like that original dime did . Want to know what I spent it on ? Five cigarettes and a Dr Pepper . " " Five cigarettes ? " " Yeah . They used to sell them loose in the country . That wasp170my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could have seen how it looked in the palm of my hand . Shining there . " " The Dr Pepper ? " " The dime , girl . The dime . You know I picked up money before . In the street and a quarter once on the riverbank . That was something too , you know . Really great . But nothing , nothing was ever like that sheephead dime . That original dime from Frisco . " He paused for a comment from her , but she made none . She just kept busy behind the screen , the wall of her sketch pad . " Just before I left home , I heard he got blown up in a gas explosion . Old Frisco . " He murmured the name . " Son of a bitch . I heard about it on my way out of town , and I could n't wait for the funeral . He worked in the gas field and got blown to bits . I left town crying like a baby . He was a nothing kind of dude , mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other women all over town . But I still cried when he got blown up and I was a full-grown man . It must have been that dime , I mean , no money ever meant much to me after that . I could n't work just for that  --  just for money . I like to have it , sure , it feels fine for a while , but there 's no magic in it . No sheephead . No Frisco . And nothing to buy worth anything , anyway . I mean nothing like five Chesterfieldcigarettes and a Dr Pepper . Talk about good ! " He threw his head back and directed his laughter into the sky . He was beautiful , like that ; laughing like that : teeth lips mustache perfectand perfectly disarming . Jadine paused . She could not draw his laughing heaven-raised face . " Well , anyway , I guess that 's what I want , all I want , in the money line . Something nice and simple and personal , you know ? My original original dime . " Jadine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really lazy . I never thought I 'd hear a black man admit it . " She rubbed the line with her thumb and frowned . " Uh-uh . I 'm not admitting any such thing . " Son 's voice cracked with indignation . " Ah got duh sun in duh mawnin and duh moon at night . "  |p171Jadine  waggled her charcoal stick and rocked her head like " truckin on down . " " O00000 , Ah got plenty of nuffin and nuffin 's plenty fo meeeeeee . " Son laughed in spite of himself . " That 's not lazy . " " What is it then ? " " It 's not being able to get excited about money . " " Get able . Get excited . " " What for ? " " For you , for yourself , your future . Money is n't what the scramble 's all about . It 's what money does , can do . " " What can it do ? " " Please . Do n't give me that transcendental , Thoreau crap . Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's who ? " " Thoreau . " " Jesus . " " Do n't look disgusted . I 'm illiterate . " " You 're not illiterate . You 're stupid . " " So tell me ; educate me . Who is he ? " " Another time , okay ? Just hold your head still and stop making excuses about not having anything . Not even your original dime . It 's not romantic . And it 's not being free . It 's dumb . You think you 're above it , above money , the rat race and all that . But you 're not above it , you 're just without it . It 's a prison , povertyis . Look at what its absence made you do : run , hide , steal , lie . " " Money did n't have anything to do with that . " " Sure it did . If you had some you could have paid a lawyer , a good lawyer , and he would have gotten you off . You think like a kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then what did you run away for ? You told Ondine you got into some trouble with the law and jumped bail . " " I did n't want to go to prison . "  | " But  --  " " That 's not the same thing . I did n't want their punishment . I wanted my own . " " Well , you got it . " " Yeah . " " And you might end up with theirs and yours . " " No way . " " You 're like a baby . A big country baby . Anybody ever tell you that ? " " No . Nobody ever told me that . " " Well , you are . Like you were just born . Where are your family ? " " Home , I guess . " " You do n't know ? " " I have n't been back in a long time . " " Where in Florida are you from ? " " Eloe . " " Eloe ? What on earth is that ? A town ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it already : gas stations , dust , heat , dogs , shacks , general store with ice coolers full of Dr Pepper . " " No shacks in Floe . " " Tents , then . Trailer camps . " " Houses . There are ninety houses in Eloe . All black . " " Black houses ? " " Black people . No whites . No white people live in Floe . " " You 're kidding me . " " I 'm not . " " Black mayor ? " " No mayor at all , black or white . " " Who runs it ? " " Runs itself . " " Come on . Who pumps the water , hooks up the telephones ? " " Oh , well , white folks do that . "  | " I 'll bet they do . " " But they live in Poncie , Ferris , Sutterfield  --  off a ways . " " I see . What work do these ninety black people do ? " " Three hundred and eighty-five . Ninety houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What work do they do ? " " They fish a little . " " Sheephead . Right . O00000 , Ah got plenty of nuffin . . . " " Do n't laugh . They work in the gas field too , in Poncie and Sutterfield . And they farm a little . " " God . Eloe . " " Where 's your home ? " " Baltimore . Philadelphia . Paris . " " City girl . " " Believe it . " " Oh , I believe it . " " Were you ever in Philly ? " She put the pad and pencil down and rubbed her fingers together . " Never . " " Just as well . " Jadine dug her fingers in the sand then brushed them . " Not so hot ? " " Well , better than Eloe . " " Nothing 's better than Eloe . " " Oh , sure . When 's the last time you were there ? " " Long time . Eight years . " " Eight , huh . You have n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten your name by now . " " She 's been dead . My father raised us . " " He know your name ? " " He knows it . Sure , he knows it . " " I do n't . What is it ? " " I told you already  --  everybody calls me Son . " " I want to know what 's on your birth certificate . "  | " No birth certificates in Eloe . " " What about your Social Security card . That says Son ? " No . That says William Green . " At last . " " One of them anyway . I got another that says Herbert Robinson . And one says Louis Stover . I got a driver 's license that says " Okay . Okay . But I ca n't call you Son . Hi , Son . Come here , Son .

I need something that fits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question I want to ask anyway and the best name will fit right in . Here I go . Why did you have to leave Eloe on the run , leave so fast you could n't go to Frisco 's funeral , uh , uh , Phil ? ' That 's good . That 's Anglicized French for son . " " Not Phil . Anything but Phil . " " Well , what then ? " " What about Sugar ? Why did you have to leave Floe on the run , Sugar ? ' " " All right . What did you do to have to leave Floe on the run , Sugar ? So fast , Sugar , you could n't go to the funeral of the man who gave you your original dime ? ' " " I killed somebody . " Actually he did n't look like a baby or even a big old country boy dressed up in a white man 's suit . His hair was cut and his nails filed , but he had lived in the house and hid in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips into the back of her skirt and underneath the light cologne was a man with hair like snakes . It was hot . Hazy and hot . A bad day for a picnic . " Should I be scared ? " asked Jadine . " Not if you have to ask . " " I 'm serious . " " So am I. " " Who was he ? The man you killed ? "  |p175He  stood up , untangling himself gracefully but swiftly . They always assume that , he thought . That it was a man . " Let 's change the subject , " he said . His voice was soft , a little sad , it seemed to her , and he gazed out into the water as he spoke . Fake , she thought . He 's faking remorse and he thinks I am impressed by it . " I hate killers , " she said . " All killers . Babies . They do n't understandanything but they want everybody to understand them . Lotta nerve , do n't you think ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no nerves at all . " " I do n't feel sorry for you , you know . I think you ought to be in jail . So you can stop looking pitifully into the sea and thinking how terrible life 's been to you . " He glanced at her , briefly , as though she were a distraction from the major work of looking at the sea . " Sorry , " he murmured . " I did n't mean to . I was n't thinking about me . I was thinking about the person I killed . And that is pitiful . " " Then why 'd you do it ? " " There is no why . The reason does n't hold . I mean it was n't a good reason ; it was a mistake . " " Sure . You did n't mean to , right ? " " Oh , I meant to , but I did n't mean to . I meant the killing but I did n't mean the death . I went too far . " " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah . " " Temper , temper , temper , " she sang . He looked down at her again wishing it had been temper . Something simple like that or something forgivable like that . But he knew better and for eight years wherever he looked  --  in the molten sea , in shape-up halls , in canneries and on flophouse cots he saw that mouth dying before the eyes did when it should have been the other way around and while he could not regret the fact that she was dead , he was ashamed of having been unable to look her in the eyes as she died . She deserved that . Every/body deserves that . That somebody look at them , with them , as they face death  --  especially the killer . But he had not had the courage or the sympathy and it shamed him . He looked at Jadine . Now it was her turn to gaze into the sea . " Who 'd you kill ? " she said . " A woman . " " I should have known . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? Kill a woman ? Was she black ? " " Yes . " " Of course . Of course she was . What did she do ? Cheat on you ? " She said it ugly . Cheat . Like " Take away your candy ? " He nodded . " My my my . And you , I suppose , were the faithful boyfriend who never looked at another girl . " " Never . After I got out of the army , never . I played a little  --  piano , I mean , at night . Nothing much but okay until I could get on at the gas field . I had this gig in Sutterfield . Off and on for about three months . Then one morning I came home and . . . " " No , " sang Jadine , " do n't tell me . You found her with somebody else and shot her . " " No . I mean yes , I found her  --  that way , but I did n't go in . I left . I got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , and I backed the car out in the road , but I could n't leave , could n't leave them there so I turned the car around and drove it through the house . " " You ran over them ? " Jadine 's upper lip was lifted in disgust . " No , I just busted up the place . But the car exploded and the bed caught on fire . It was a little place we had , just a little box , and I drove through the bedroom wall . I pulled her out of the fire but she never made it . They booked me after that . " " What about the man ? " " It was n't a man ; it was a boy . Thirteen , I heard . Singed him bald , but nothing more . They had me up for Murder Two . " He was still standing and now he looked down at her and noticed that she had folded her legs under her white cottonp177skirt . She is scared , he thought . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the house , she is too scared . Suddenly he liked it . Liked her fear . Basked in it like a cat in steam-pipe heat and it made him feel protective and violent at the same time . She was looking into the horizon and kept her legs hidden under her skirt . Does she think I 'll cut them off , or is there something under there she is afraid I will take out and kill ? The idea both alarmed and pleased him and he dropped down on one knee and said very softly , " I wo n't kill you . I love you . " Quick like a doe she turned her head . Her eyes stretched wide with the problem of deciding what to be outraged by : the promise or the confession . " You better not do either one , " she said . " I do n't want you lovingme , and do n't threaten me either . Do n't ever threaten me again . " " I was n't threatening you . I said I wo n't  --  would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? What kind of man are you ? People do n't say things like that . Nobody says that . Where do you think we are , in some jungle ? Why would you say you 're not going to kill me ? " " Shhhh . " " I wo n't shhhhh . You ca n't just sit here on the sand and say something like that . You trying to scare me ? " She 's bolting , he thought . I have disgusted her again . And it was true that she was looking at him as though he were a dwarf with a head lopsided and swollen with water . She 's right , he thought . I am crazy . Whenever I try to tell the truth it comes out wrong , or dumb or scary and there was no way to hide his helpless naked face . " No , wait a minute . I . . . I was n't trying to scare you . I was trying to comfort you . " " Comfort me ? " " Yeah . You tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to tuck your legs . I mean . . . " " What are you talking about ? " " You changed the way you were sitting . "  | " You thought I sat this way because I was afraid ? " " Okay . I was wrong . But I did n't say it to say , maybe I could but I wo n't . ' I said it so you would n't think that I would or . . . I 'm not a killer . Just that one time , accidentally when I was fucked-up . I just did n't want to see your legs folded up like that . I wanted you relaxed , like you were before . You were sassy beforeand rubbing your ankles with your hands . " Jadine looked at him trying to figure out whether he was the man who understood potted plants or the man who drove through houses . " Honest , " he said . " I did n't mean to scare you . Honest . I can live without a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet away from me just because I did n't go to jail like I was supposedto . I do n't have a real life like most people , I 've missed a lot . Do n't take your feet away from me too . " " You are not well , " she said . " Yes , I am . " " No , you 're not . " " ' Cause I like your feet ? " " You ca n't have my feet . " " I did n't ask to have them . I just asked to see them . " " I ca n't carry on a conversation like this . This is not a conversationthat anybody has . " " Let me see them . " " Stop it . " " Please ? " " Look , Harvey , Henry , Son , Billy Green , maybe we 'd just betterpack it up and call it a day . " He sat down on the hard-packed sand in front and a little to the right of her and looked at her steadily . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not crazy , Jadine . Raw , maybe , but not nuts . " " I 'm not convinced . " " A man admires your feet and you want to lock him up ? " " You need professional care . "  | " Put one foot out . Just one . I prefer two , but if you want , you can show me just one , although two is better . Two feet is a pair . They go together , so to speak . One is just  --  " he shrugged slightly  --  " one . Alone . Two is better . I want to see them both . " " I do n't know about you . " " Take your time , I 'll see them anyway when you stand up , but I 'd like it better if you showed them to me yourself . " Jadine 's feet were warm under her skirt , each one hidden near a thigh . " I wo n't touch , " he said , " I promise . " She looked past his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fuzz in the sky . Gulls with dark hoods rested beyond the surf . They looked like ducks from where she sat . All the gulls she remembered screeched and dived . She 'd never seen them quiet before , sitting still in water as though they were listening . " Come on , " he said . " Show me . Please ? " Slowly she started to unfold one leg , carefully , cautiously as though she was about to do something wild . " Just a little bit more , " he urged her . " Come on . " Quickly then , she straightened both legs and stuck them into the air . He looked at them and did not touch . The waviness traveledfrom her head to her toes pointing up from the sand . He looked at them , and whispered , " Look at that . " He leaned down for a better look . " I said I would n't touch and I wo n't . If you object , that is . But I have to tell you how much I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch . " If you do n't want me to , I wo n't , though , like I said . " He wants to kiss my feet , she thought . He wants to put his mouth on my foot . If he does I 'll kick his teeth out . But she did n't move . " Can I ? Can I touch it right there ? " She did n't answer and he did n't say anything more for several pulse beats . Then he did it . Put his forefinger on her sole and held it and held it and held it there . " Please stop , " she said , and he did , but his forefinger stayedp180where his finger had been in the valley of her naked foot . Even after she laced up the canvas shoes . " I 've got to get back , " she said . He stood quickly so there would be no mistake , and walked ahead of her , leading the way . He drove this time , while Jadine sat quietly going over in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him make love to her ; the reasons it would be impossible to even consider going to bed with him , fingerprint or no fingerprint , laughing into the sky or not . The most important reason was that he expected her to . As hard as she tried , he did not seem convinced that she was unattracted to him . Second , it would trouble Nanadine and Sydney . Third , he was n't manageable . Afterward . What would he be like afterward ? Stake a claim ? Try to trade his room for hers ? Drive the jeep into the house if she said no ? He was whistling now , driving along whistlingthrough closed teeth like he already had it made . Still , she had been there two whole months with nobody . Jadine sighed and set her jaw . Fifteen more minutes and they would be back at the house where she could put the whole business out of her mind , but the jeep slowed down and she could n't believe it . He must have done something ; did he think she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true ; he pumped and pumped the accelerator . Nothing happened . The gauge was securelyempty . Jadine looked around : jungle muck on both sides ; trees close to the road on the left . An uphill walk to the house was longer than a trek back to the pier . Jadine reached into the glove compartment and took out a key . " It unlocks the pump back at the pier , " she said . " Got something to put it in ? " he asked . " In back under the seat , there 's a five-liter bottle . Use that . " " I hope you 're right . That there 's gas in that pump . " " I hope I am too . If not , get some from the boat . I know there 's some there . " He nodded . " Twenty minutes about , to get there and another twenty to get back . "  |p181She  agreed and settled back in the seat crossing her legs . " You 're not coming with me ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Alone ? " " Go on , will you ? I 'll be all right . There 's nobody on the island I do n't know . If somebody drives down , I 'll have them pick you up and bring you back . " He left then and Jadine rummaged around in the basket to see if there was anything left of the awful lunch . Nothing . Nothing at all . She sat for a while under the hateful sun that had come out in full dress when they least needed her . Thank God there were no mosquitoes here , just a funny jungle-rot smell . She waited until the sun burnt a hole in her head . She did n't have a watch on but thought twenty minutes must have passed by . Only twenty more . Then she decided to seek shelter from the sun under the trees to the left of the road , in spite of that unpleasant odor . This was the ugly part of Isle des Chevaliers  --  the part she averted her eyes from whenever she drove past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its silence . Her jangled nerves she attributed however to the conversation with Son , the print of his forefinger on her foot , and the silly thoughts she 'd had afterward . A fair amount of composure returned quickly once they had gotten back to the jeep where all was familiar , but a tremor had not yet died in her stomach and required the resolutionsof a new nun to subdue . It was nothing like the fear-slashed anger she had felt the morning he had held her from behind and pressed into her . Nothing like that . But he was bathed now , clipped and beautiful with spacious tender eyes and a woodsy voice . His smile was always a surprise like a sudden rustle of wind across the savanna of his face . Playful sometimes , sometimesnot . Sometimes it made her grab the reins . She took her pad and a stick of charcoal and walked toward the trees , wishing once more that she had had genuine talent in her fingers . She loved to paint and draw so it was unfair not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , to know the difference between thep182fine and the mediocre , so she 'd put that instinct to work and studied art history  --  there she was never wrong . The trees were not as close together as she 'd thought . Tall bushes had made them seem so . She approached the shade and peeped in between the trees . She almost laughed at what she saw . Young trees ringed and soared above a wavy mossy floor . There was hardly any color ; just greens and browns because there was hardly any light and what light there was  --  a sentimental shaft of sunlight to the left  --  bunched the brown into deeper shadow . In the center under a roof of greens was a lawn of the same dark green the Dutchmen loved to use . The circle of trees looked like a standing rib of pork . Jadine tucked her pad under her arm and clenched the charcoal stick . It was amazing ; the place looked like something by Bruce White or Fazetta  --  an elegantcomic book illustration . She stepped through some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lawn , the center of the place began only a couple of yards ahead . She walked toward it and sank up to her knees . She dropped the pad and charcoal and grabbed the waist of a tree which shivered in her arms and swayed as though it wished to dance with her . She struggled to lift her feet and sank an inch or two farther down into the moss-covered jelly . The pad with Son 's face badly sketched looked up at her and the women hanging in the trees looked down at her . There is an easy way to get out of this , she thought , and every Girl Scout knows what it is but I do n't . Movementwas not possible . At least not sudden movement . Perhaps she was supposed to lie horizontally . She tightened her arms around the tree and it swayed as though it wished to dance with her . Count , she thought . I will count to fifty and then pull , then count again and pull again . She had only to hang on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . And she would spend it edging up the tree that wanted to dance . No point in looking down at the slime , it would make her think of worms or snakes or crocodiles . Count . Just count . Do n't sweat or you 'll lose your partner , the tree . Cleave together like lovers . Press togetherp183like man and wife . Cling to your partner , hang on to him and never let him go . Creep up on him a millimeter at a time , slower than the slime and cover him like the moss . Caress his bark and finger his ridges . Sway when he sways and shiver with him too . Whisper your numbers from one to fifty into the parts that have been lifted away and left tender skin behind . Love him and trust him with your life because you are up to your kneecaps in rot . The young tree sighed and swayed . The women looked down from the rafters of the trees and stopped murmuring . They were delighted when first they saw her , thinking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking closer they saw differently . This girl was fighting to get away from them . The women hanging from the trees were quiet now , but arrogant  --  mindful as they were of their value , their exceptional femaleness ; knowing as they did that the first world of the world had been built with their sacred properties ; that they alone could hold togetherthe stones of pyramids and the rushes of Moses 's crib ; knowing their steady consistency , their pace of glaciers , their permanentembrace , they wondered at the girl 's desperate struggle down below to be free , to be something other than they were . Jadine counted to fifty eight times , pulled eight times , then her right knee grazed something hard and she managed to lift her leg and bend it enough to kneel on the hard thing that seemed to be growing out of her partner the tree . It held and she got her other leg up , but the slimy soles of her shoes could find no other footing on the bark . She had to shimmy , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up far enough , she twisted with a giant effort around to the road side of the tree  --  the part of the trunk that leaned out of solid ground . She slid down on her stomach and when Son came sweating up the hill she was crying a little and cleaning her feet and legs with leaves . The white skirt showed a deep dark and sticky hem and hung over the door of the jeep . She was in halter and panties . " What the hell happened to you ? " He ran to her and put thep184bottle on the seat . She did n't look up , just wiped her eyes and said , " I took a walk over there and fell in . " " Over where ? " " There . Behind those trees . " " Fell in what ? That looks like oil . " " I do n't know . Mud I guess , but it felt like jelly while I was in it . But it does n't come off like jelly . It 's drying and sticking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff was shiny in places and where it was dry it was like mucilage . Nothing much was happening with her leaves . He shook some drops of the gasoline onto a clean place in her skirt and handed it to her . She took it and continued to clean herself in silence . He poured the gas into the tank and they waited for a few minutes for it to get into the line , and only when the motor finally caught did Jadine hazard a glance back at the place where she 'd gone in . She could not identify the tree that had danced with her . Son drove slowly up the hill to conserve the gas . He glanced at her from time to time , but could see she was not about to be consoled easily . He decided to tease her gently . " That 's where the swamp women live , " he said . " You see any ? " She did n't answer . " They mate with the horsemen up in the hills . " " Oh , shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have seen one . " " Look , " she said . " I might have died . That mess was up to my knees . Do n't try to cheer me up ; it 's not funny ! Just drive , will you , and get me home so I can get this shit off me ! " " Okay , okay , " he said , and smiled because he liked her sitting next to him in her underwear . Liked it so much it was hard to look serious when they drove up to the house and Margaret , sitting on the living room patio , came round to see who it was . " An accident , " said Jadine before Margaret could shift her stare from the underwear to Son . " I took a walk and fell in the swamp . " " My God , " said Margaret . " You poor thing . You must havep185been scared out of your mind . Where was he ? " She jutted her chin at Son 's back as he drove the jeep to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . We ran out . " Jadine was hurrying into the house . IIer legs were burning from the gasoline . " I have to get in the tub . " Margaret followed her . " Soap first . Then alcohol . Jesus , what is that stuff ? It looks like pitch . " In the bedroom Jadine took off halter and panties and tiptoed into the bathroom . " He 's bad luck , Jade . He really is . Any time anybody gets near him , something happens . " " Except Valerian , " said Jadinc . " He 's good luck for Valerian . " " That figures , " said Margaret . " Turpentine 's better , honey . You have any ? " " No . But it 's coming off all right with the soap . I wo n't be able to wax my legs for a week now . God , it burns . " " He 's bad luck , Jade . Really . I just know it . " " Do n't worry , Margaret , Michael will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's going to be so nice . I 'm cooking everything myself , did I tell you ? " " You told me . " " He has n't been here since he was fourteen . I could like this place if he 'd stay . I could like everything about it . He wo n't spoil it , will he ? " " Who ? " " Him . Willie . " " No . Why would he ? He 's leaving as soon as Valerian hears from the consulate . What are you afraid of ? " " Well , Jade , he was in my closet . " " He is n't there now . What 's the matter , Margaret ? You think he wants your bod ? " " I do n't know what I think . I 'm all nerves . This place makes me crazy and so does he . Look at you , you go off with him , step out of a car and fall in a mudhole. "  | " Margaret , I fell in , not you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jadine surprised herself ; she was defending him against her . She thought it was gone  --  that mistrust , that stupid game she and Margaret used to play . Any minute now , Margaret would be reaching out her hand and saying " What 'd ja do to yer hay-er ? What 'd ja do to yer hay-er ? " like white girls all over the world , or telling her about Dorcus , the one black girl she ever looked in the face . But there was a little bit more in her annoyance now . Maybe she should just say it . He does n't want you , Margaret . He wants me . He 's crazy and beautiful and black and poor and beautifuland he killed a woman but he does n't want you . He wants me and I have the fingerprint to prove it . But she did n't say any of that ; she said she wanted to sleep now . Margaret left but her alarm stayed behind . Jadine got into bed and discovered she was jealous of Margaret of all people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sole purpose in life was to seduce her . Naturally her . A white woman no matter how old , how flabby , how totally sexless , believed it and she could have shot him for choosing Margaret 's closet and giving her reason to believe it was true . God . Jadine turned over carefully to protect her raw legs . I am competing with her for rape ! She thinks this place is driving her crazy ; it 's making a moron out of me . Certified . It took some time before she could fall asleep . The soap had done its job . The little feet he wanted so badly to see were clean again , peachy soft again as though they had never been touched and never themselves had touched the ground.  |p187CHRISTMAS  EvE 'S EVE and even the goddamn hydrangeahad bloomed ! The whole island was vomiting up color like a drunk and here in the corner , in plastic filtered light , was one spot of sane , refinedmauve . Valerian sprayed it with water and aerated the soil around the stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shy violet buds with his wineglass . Maybe Margaret was right : this would be a warm and memorable Christmas . The black man had brought luck to the greenhouse , maybe he 'd bring luck to the whole celebration . Michelin would be there ; Michael , Michael 's friend ; that was just enough . And Margaret was sober and busy and cheerfully preoccupied with something outside herself for a change . Valerian walked away from the hydrangea and looked out the window toward the washhouse . The washerwoman was there , bless her heart , with the yard boy . He could n't hear them , but they looked as though they were laughing . A nip , he thought . They 're already celebrating and have taken a Christmas nip . He liked that . That was the way a holiday ought to begin and since everything was in its place as it should be  --  Michael coming , Margaretcooking , hydrangea in bloom  --  he decided to go out there with the servants and wish them a Merry Christmas too . All that was needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ollieballen . " Ollieballen ? "  | " Yes . My grandmother used to make it at New Year . " " The Candy Queen ? " asked Margaret . " I never heard of it . " Its not hard , " said Valerian . " It 's Dutch . " " What 's it taste like ? " " Sweet . Like a doughnut . " " We ca n't serve doughnuts at dinner , Valerian . " " It 's not for dinner , it 's for afterward . With brandy and coffee . " " This is going to be hard enough without ollieballen . " " Then let 's forget the whole thing . " " No . I said I 'd do it and I 'm going to . Michael will get a kick out of it . " " So will Ondine . " " Maybe . I 've never seen her cat anything . " " Nobody ever sees a cook eat anything . Let 's go over the menu again . Turkey , mashed potatoes and gravy , green beans  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " " You can use the apples in it . It 's easier than pie and it 's traditionalin our family  --  or it was . What about something to start ? Soup or fish ? " " Valerian . " " Something simple . You can handle it . " " You 'll help ? " " I 'll be entertaining the guests . I ca n't do both . And that 's not what you said . You said you 'd do the whole dinner for every-body . " " So how many is that ? Six ? " " Seven . It 'll be fun . You 'll enjoy it . Do n't forget it was your suggestion . " " How do you get seven ? " " B.J. has a girlfriend , does n't he ? So there 's me , you and Michael , B.J. and his guest , Jade and Michelin . Seven . The tu '  - -  key is here  --  beans , potatoes  --  nothing to it . You can make the ollieballenahead of time . Christmas Eve . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " What do I need ? " " Nothing special : yeast , eggs , milk , sugar , lemon , flour , raisins , apples and butter . " " What about the lemon whip ? " " Just lemon-flavored gelatin beaten to froth and whipped cream on top . Very simple . We can have smoked fish , perhaps , to start . All that needs is parsley . The lemon whip is a light sweet for after a heavy dinner . Then coffee and brandy with the ollie -- ballen . " Valerian spread his fingers to show how easy it was . He wanted her occupied the next few days  --  not sitting around in anxiety about when ( or if ) Michael would get there . " Doughnuts and brandy , " she said , and shook her head . " Margaret . " " No , no . It 's fine . Just sounded funny that 's all . " " They do n't have a hole in the middle . " " Too bad , " she said . " It might inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was n't why I came . I 've been hateful and I know it . I should n't have behaved that way when you found Willie up there in your closet . " " We 've been through all that . Forget it . " " It worked out okay , did n't it ? " " I suppose . " " You should see the greenhouse now . Black magic . " " Really ? " " Really . You should come and see . And I ant sorry , Margaret . I liked what you did though . " " Sure . We 'll do it again sometime . " " Soon ? " " Soon . " " Now . " " Now ? " " Why not ? " " It does n't work like that , Valerian . I mean I ca n't just lie down in the middle of the afternoon . "  | " I can . I can even kneel . Might need help getting back up , but I can do it . " " No . Wait . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner is that ? I would n't have it for lunch . Does she think she 's doing me a favor ? " " Stop grumbling . It 's Christmastime and for once in your life you do n't have to cook the dinner . " " But I have to do the dishes , I bet . " " No , you do n't . " " Who then ? You ? No Mary . No Yardman . They decide not to show up without telling anybody . Everything 's on me . A pile of laundry a mile high in there . Jadine off playing games with that jailbird ; guests coming . . . " " I told you he already called Dr. Michelin , and Dr. Michelin said he 'd get us somebody right away . Maybe not right away because they got Christmas there too , but he thinks his housekeepercan find somebody . We 'll just have to make do for a day or two . Let the laundry stay there , and get yourself organized . You are worrying the life out of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please . And if you expect anything at all to go right , you better quit soon . " " You the one riding people . You been hot for days . Nothing can please you . " " The whole house is upset . Hard to think and be nice in a house that 's upset . " " The house is not upset . You are . Everybody else is laughing and having a good time but you . Mr. Street slept with his wife last night . You know how long it 's been since he did that ? Slept in the same bed with her ? " " Slept is the word all right . " " Do n't you believe it . They been cooing all morning . "  | " I do n't care . They ought to sleep together . I never did know how he puts up with that . Whoever heard of married folks sleeping any other way but together . They can sleep anywhere they want . It 's where Jadine sleeps that bothers me . " " She slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring this basin down on your head . You know what I 'm talking about . " " Well , what you want me to do about it ? " " Talk to somebody . " " Who ? " " Her . " " Get away from me . " " Sydney , listen here . I do n't like it . None of it . What she want to mess with him for ? He ai n't got a dime and no prospect of one . " She 's just playing . Nothing much else to do out here , you know that . Cleaned him up and he looks fine and even acts all right . Look here . They pack a lunch , go off to the beach and swim a little . What is that ? Marriage ? First you was screaming because you thought she was going to marry some white boy ; now she goes swimming with one of us and you still mad . Jadine 's not a fool and he 's okay . " " He is not okay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get me to calm down . I was ready to shoot him . Now you the one want the gun . " " I just do n't like it . " " What you afraid of ? She 's not going off with him . Just because you foolish , do n't think she is . She 's worked hard to make something out of herself , and nothing will make her throw it all away on a swamp nigger . " " It ai n't what she thinks that worries me . It 's what he thinks . " " You know something I do n't ? " " No. "  | " Well then . " " But I 've seen his eyes when nobody 's looking . At least when he thinks nobody 's looking . " " And what did you see in his eyes , Ondine ? " " Wildness . Plain straight-out wildness . He wants her , Sydney . And he 'll do what he has to do to get her and what he has to to keep her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Would n't put it past him . " " Mr. Street likes him . " " He likes him because Jadine likes him . " " No . He helped him with those plants in there . Made somethinggrow that was dying . " " He wants to keep him here so Jade will stay and if Jadine stays then his wife might stay and if Michael does show up maybe she wo n't want to go running off after him . " " Well . Maybe he 's right . " " Do n't rely on it . If that boy gets in she 'll be out of here like a shot . She 's got a lot of cleaning up to do with Michael . It 's sitting on her heart and she 's never going to have no peace until she cleans it up . She 'll trail him to the end of the world and God himself knows that is exactly where she ought to be . " " You hate that woman , and you want her out of here so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate her ; I feel sorry for her , to tell the truth . " " Want some more hot water in there ? " " No , this is fine . " " It 's going to be all right , Ondine . She is coming in the kitchen to cook Christmas dinner . And you have to get out of the way . Maybe it 'll taste bad , but it 's only for one night . We can behave for one night , ca n't we ? Then it 'll be over and everything will be back to normal . " " Everything but my feet . " " Your feet too . Put ' em up here . Let me rub them for you . " " They not going to last much longer , you know . I get thep193littlest cut on them now and it do n't seem to heal . I have to stand up to do the work I do , if I ca n't stand then I ca n't work . " " When you ca n't stand , girl , sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take care of you , you know that . " " We do n't have a place of our own . And the little bit of savings went to Jadine . Not that I regret a penny of it ; I do n't . " " We got a few stocks and Social Security . Years of it . Rememberhow I tried to get Mr. Street not to take it out , back when we first started , and he would n't listen to me ? Now I appreciate the fact that he did n't . " " Such a smart little girl , and so pretty . I never minded not having children after we started taking care of her . I would have stood on my feet all day all night to put her through that school . And when my feet were gone , I would have cooked on my knees . " " I know , baby , I know . " " She crowned me , that girl did . No matter what went wrong or how tired I was , she was my crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We never could have done it without him . " " And I 'm grateful . You know I am . I 've never had no problem with him . He 's a nuisance , but he stood by us when we needed him to . " " And she never objected to it , Ondine . A lot of wives would have . " " I suppose . " " Lay back . Put your legs up on this pillow . Rest yourself and do n't worry about nothing . Nothing 's going to change . Everything'sgoing to be all right . " " She would n't up and marry some no-count Negro , would she ? I do n't care how good-looking and sweet-talking he is . You did n't say nothing about stuffin . Is she going to stuff that bird or just roast him empty ? " " Rest , girl . " " And what the devil is lemon whip ? "  |p194NOBODY  CAME . At least none of the invited . The emperorbutterflies flew in the window , but they were not invited , nor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tin-tin birds sitting in formation at the top of the bougainvillea . But the maiden aunts were n't there , thank God , with their wispy maiden aunt hair . Still nobody came . Uninvited and emergency guests shared dinner on Christmas Day . First the telephone operator read off the cable from B. J. Bridges : " Bostonweather can not fly okay postpone New Year . " Then Dr. Michelin called with regrets saying the crossing would be too rough . Finally customs contrele reported there was no red trunk on the last flight arriving at nine in the morning from Miami , and there was no Houston flight at all that day . More telephone calls . Michael did not answer his telephone . Margaretwould have caved in Christmas Eve except for the busy-ness of confirming the disaster : more placing of calls  --  forty-fiveminutewaits until they were connected ; more cables with " confirmdelivery " instructions ; Michael 's neighbors were summoned , but the number had changed or the neighbors had ; his old girlfriends were asked to go to his house and check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before Christmas and people had other things to do . Then there was the wrapping of gifts , the ollieballen to make , the turkey that was really a goose to prepare . Margaret was too tired to feel her sorrow at its deepest point until Christmas Day dawned bright and secular and nobodyat all came to L'Arbe de la Croix , and nobody was in his proper place . Ondine was in the bathtub . Margaret was in the kitchen . Sydney was in the greenhouse cutting flowers for the table . Jadine was in the washhouse waiting for a dryer load to conclude . And Valerian was by the telephone placing incompletecalls . Son , who had no place of his own , got in everybody'sway . The exchange of gifts , scheduled for Michael 's arrival , took place anywhere , furtively and without fanfare orp195enthusiasm . When it was certain that no one was coming and the day looked as if it belonged to the tin-tin birds and not to family and friends , Valerian , to raise Margaret 's spirits probablyor simply to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and have the dinner among ourselves . Everybody . Jade , Willie , Ondine , Sydney . " They would all have a good time , he said . Margaret nodded , and left the kitchen , where the uses of things now eluded her completely . She was in control the night before  --  enough to wash the fowl whose legs would not stand up as they ought to . But the ollieballen recipe slipped out of reach entirely . Sydney rescued it and now when Valerian called her away from the kitchen she seemed not to care one way or another . It was just another meal now and the dinner she had planned to cook Ondine had to finish , including the lemon whip . Ondine was persuaded to dress up and join Sydney and the others in the dining room partly because she 'd had the foresight to bake a ham and a coconut cake and would not be required to eat Margaret 's menu and partly because she 'd have to eat alone otherwise , but she was deeply unhappy about being thrown out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when Margaret abandoned the whole thing halfway through because the guests were different . She was also unhappybecause she thought Jadine had secret plans to leave right after Christmas . A few days ago she had the humiliation of Alma Estee handing her a pair of recently worn pajamas that she found in the gardenia bushes underneath Jadine 's bedroom . Ondine took them and did not mention the find to anyone , but it worried her . Jadine 's scurrilous remarks about Son seemed too pointed , too loud . Sydney took the invitation in stride . The suggestion of a special and intimate relationship with his employerpleased him more than it disconcerted him . And what was unthinkable and undesirable in Philadelphia was not so on that island . In addition , it leveled , in a way , the invitation Mr. Street had extended to Son when everybody thought he wasp196a burglar . More than leveled  --  this invitation was formal and sober although it was an emergency solution to a rapidly deterioratingholiday . Jadine was enchanted . Wanted everybody dressed up and gave Ondine and Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exacting a promise from her aunt that she would wear hers to dinner . It was hard to tell what Son felt . Perhaps he did not know himself . For such a long time a Christmas spent on land for him was an extempore dinner or party with miscellaneous people he never expected to see again . This was another , except that the imminent exit of one of those persons alarmed him . She said " before I go " on the beach . Not " before you go . " And he had had a brief encounter with Margaret that confirmed it . He was still apologizingall around and saw Margaret lying in a canvas-back chair , sunning herself in the shade and away from the wind too , so she could acquire a tan but not the aging of skin that would accompany it . Her place for this was on the patio outside the living room where the piano was , sheltered by the bougainvillea bushes . Next to her chair on a small glass-topped table was a box of stationery , Bain de Soleil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was in a bathing suit and Son thought she was like a marshmallow warming but not toasting itself . That inside the white smooth skin was liquid sugar , no bones , no cartilage  --  just liquid sugar , soft and a little pully . Quite unlike her tips , where all of her strength was . Direction , focus , aggression , tenacity  --  all that was tough and survivalist in her lay in the tips of her fingers , the tips of her toes , her nose tip , her chin tip , and he suspected her breast tips were tiny brass knobs like those ornately carved fixtures screwed into the drawers of Jadine 's writing table . Even the top of her head was fierce , pulled back as it was into a red foxtail of stamina . She heard him approach and turned her head slowly . The minute she saw him , she reached for her towel . Son picked it up from the flagstones and handed it to her . His gesture was swift andp197accommodating so she did not fling it over herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in her lap . " I scare you ? " " No . Yes , " she said . " I did n't hear you come up . " He did not comment on that so she said , " What is it ? " " Nothing . I just saw you out here and wanted to say hello . " " Hello . Is that all ? " " That 's all . " " It should n't be . You should have more to say after what you did to me . " " What did I do to you ? " He was counting on the liquid sugar . Never mind the tips . " You know what . You sat in my closet and scared the hell out of me . " He smiled . " You scared the hell out of me too . " " Bullshit , " she said . " It 's true . Your husband was right ; you were wrong . As soon as he saw me he knew I did n't mean no harm . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet ; I saw you . " " What did you see ? " " I saw a big black man sitting in my closet is what I saw . " " I 'm not so big . Your husband 's bigger  --  taller  --  than I am . Besides , I was sitting down . What made you think I was big ? " " There are no small men in a closet . Unless the closet belongs to them . Any stranger in a closet is big . Big and scary . I thought  --  " " You thought what ? " She looked at him out of the corner of her eyes and did not answer . Son finished her sentence . " That I was going to  --  that if you had n't come in and turned on the light , I was going to stay there , wait there , until you went to bed and then I would creep out and GETCHA ! " He laughed then , laughed like a ten-yearoldat a Three Stooges movie . Mouth wide open , bubbly sounds coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to make fun of it . " But he kept on laughing , long enough to make a little anger spread inside her . When he could stop laughing he said , " I 'm sorry , I was n't laughing at you . I was laughing at myself . I was seeing myself do it . Or try to do it , and it looked funny . Me with my raggedy pants down around my ankles trying to get in your bed . " " It 's not funny . " " No , it 's not , but believe me it would n't have been much of a rape . Sex is hard when you 're starving , but I thank you for the compliment . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Margaret spread the towel across her knees and picked up the iced glass . " And the part I do understand , I do n't believe . " " When your son gets here , ask him . He 'll explain it . " Margaret stopped sipping the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " About as old as your son . " " My son is twenty-nine going on thirty . " " Okay . Almost as old as your son . " " He 'll be thirty March tenth . " " Does he favor you or your husband ? " " Favor ? " " Look like . Does he look like you ? " " People say so . Everybody says so . The hair , of course , and his eyes are blue like mine . Everybody says he looks exactly like me . Nothing like his father . " " He must be good-looking . " " He is . He is . But tall like Valerian . Is that true ? You 're shorter than Valerian ? " Son nodded . " He 's got at least two inches on me . " " Huh , " she said , " I would n't have thought so . Well , Michael is every bit as tall as Valerian , but he does look more like me . Inside though , that 's where he 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for a year now ? He 's been working onp199an Indian reservation . With the young people there , teenagers . There 's a lot of suicide among Indian teenagers . The conditions are awful , you know . You would not believe . I visited him when he was in Arizona . Well , some of the tribesmen have money but they 're just  --  well , they do n't really help their own . Most of them live in terrible conditions and they are very proud people , you know . Very . Michael encourages them to keep their own heritage intact . You 'd really like Michael . Everybody does . " He listened . She took sips of the Evian and lime as she talked , her knees covered with the towel . She was looking at him now . Relaxed . Interested in what she was saying . Interested in his hearing it , knowing it , knowing that her son was beautiful , wise and kind . That he loved people , was not selfish , was actually selfsacrificing , committed , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be dissolute , reckless , trivial , greedy . But he was n't . He had not turned out that way . He could have been president of the candy company if he had wanted , but he wanted value in his life , not money . He had turned out fine , just fine . " Jade knows him , " she said . " They used to see each other during the summers she spent with us . Oh , he 'll be thrilled to see her again . She 's not leaving till a couple of days after Christmasso they 'll have some time together . " Son did not blink  --  he took it in and nodded his appreciation of Michael into his mother 's face . She was leaving soon . Margaret was perspiring a little bit on the forehead . A light glisten on the healthy and cared-for skin . Her blue-if-it's-a-boy blue eyes wide open , not squinting in the sun for it could not get to her under the shade of the bougainvillea . Just the heat , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THEY SE R V E D themselves from the sideboard and drank wine in some haste to hurry the dismal affair along . The forced gaiety was helped into some semblance of naturalness by Jadine with much cheery help from Valerian . Sydney was awkward butp200subdued . Ondine was irritable , her aching feet encased in high heels with zircons up the back . " The turkey is very tender , Mrs. Street , " said Sydney . Margaret smiled . " Not bad at all , " said Valerian , who had none of it on his plate . " Geese makes excellent turkey . " He glanced at Margaret to see if she would be amused . She seemed not to hear . " Lot of fat in a goose . " Ondine was slicing her ham . " It should be cooked on its breast , not on its back . " " Oh , but I like the juices . " " That ai n't juice , Jadine , that 's grease , " Ondine answered . Valerian lifted his fork like a toastmaster . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " " What ? " asked Jadine . " You 'll see . An old family recipe . Right , Margaret ? Margaret ? " " Oh . Yes . Right . It was n't hard . " " Do n't be modest . " Sydney looked at Ondine with what he hoped was a stern gaze . They say it 's a surprise , his eyes seemed to be saying , let 's agree and be surprised . Ondine kept her eyes on her ham . " Is that the phone ? " Margaret was alert . " Would you get that , Sydney ? " " I 'll get it . " Margaret was rising from her chair . " No , let Sydney . " No one spoke as Sydney left the room . " Dr. Michelin , " said Sydney when he returned , " calling to say Merry Christmas . I suggested he call back later . " " I thought it might be the airport , " said Margaret . " Airport , what for ? You heard the final news . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a break in the weather . " " The weather is in Boston , not California . " " How do you know that ? " " I think , " said Jadine , " that the radio said there were storms all over.  | " Downed the telephone lines too , I suppose , " said Valerian . " Probably , yes  --  " Margaret 's voice was a bit shrill . " Well , he 'll be sorry , " said Valerian . " He 's missing some very good food and some very good company . We should have thought of this before . Give Ondine a clay off , and you get to show off in the kitchen , Margaret . It 's good to have some plain Pennsylvania food for a change . This is an old-fashioned Christmas . " " Too bad Gideon could n't come . " Son , who seemed to be the only one genuinely enjoying the food , had been silent until then . " Who ? " asked Valerian . " Gideon . Yardman . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a beautiful name . Gideon . " Valerian smiled . " Well , at least we knew Mary 's name . Mary , " said Jadine . " Nope , " said Son . " No ? " " Therese . " " Therese ? Wonderful , " said Valerian . " Therese the Thief and Gideon the Get Away Man . " Ondine looked up . " They did n't steal that chocolate , Mr. Street . That was this one here . " She nodded her head at Son . " Chocolate ? Who 's talking about chocolate ? They stole the apples . " Valerian got up to go to the sideboard for some more mashed potatoes and gravy . " Gideon stole apples ? " asked Son . " Yep . " Valerian 's back was to them . " I caught him red-handed , so to speak . Them , rather . She , Mary , had them stuffed in her blouse . He had some in each pocket . " Sydney and Ondine both stopped eating . " What did he say ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said he was going to put them back . " Valerian rejoined them and chuckled . " So that 's why they did n't come back to work . Ashamed . " " Oh , more than that , " said Valerian . " Much more than that . I fired him . Her too . "  | " You what ? " Ondine almost shouted . " Ondine , " ' Sydney whispered . " You did n't tell us , " she said to Valerian . " Beg pardon ? " Valerian looked amused . " I mean . . . Did you know that , Sydney ? " " No . Nobody told me anything . " " Mr. Street , you could have mentioned it . " " I 'll get someone else . I 've already spoke to Michelin , I told you that . " " But I thought that was temporary help , until they came back after Christmas , I thought . " " Well , Ondine , it is n't temporary help I 'm asking for . It 's permanent because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Margaret said softly . " I 'm getting a headache . " " I never bicker , Margaret . I am discussing a domestic problem with my help . " " Well , they are guests tonight . " " The problem is still of interest to everybody at the table , exceptyou . " " Certain things I need to know , " Ondine was talking into her plate , " if I 'm to get work done right . I took on all sorts of extra work because I thought they were just playing hooky . I did n't know they was fired . " " Ondine , what would you have done differently if you had known ? You would have grumbled , and tried to make me keep them on . And since they were obviously stealing , and the whole house was upset anyway , I did what I thought was best . " " I would n't have tried any such thing , if they stole . I do n't condone that . " " Well , they did and I let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went dry as he watched Valerian chewing a piece of ham , his head-of-a-coin profile content , approving even of the flavor in his mouth although he had been able to dismiss with a flutter of the fingers the people whose sugar and cocoa had al/lowed him to grow old in regal comfort ; although he had taken the sugar and cocoa and paid for it as though it had no value , as though the cutting of cane and picking of beans was child 's play and had no value ; but he turned it into candy , the invention of which really was child 's play , and sold it to other children and made a fortune in order to move near , but not in the midst of , the jungle where the sugar came from and build a palace with more of their labor and then hire them to do more of the work he was not capable of and pay them again according to some scale of value that would outrage Satan himself and when those people wanted a little of what he wanted , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed them with a flutter of the fingers , because they were thieves , and nobody knew thieves and thievery better than he did and he probably thought he was a law-abiding man , they all did , and they all always did , because they had not the dignity of wild animals who did not eat where they defecated but they could defecate over a whole people and come there to live and defecate some more by tearing up the land and that is why they loved property so , because they had killed it soiled it defecated on it and they loved more than anything the places where they shit . Would fight and kill to own the cesspools they made , and although they called it architecture it was in fact elaborately built toilets , decorated toilets , toilets surrounded with and by business and enterprise in order to have something to do in between defecations since waste was the order of the day and the ordering principle of the universe . And especially the Americanswho were the worst because they were new at the business of defecation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stench of the cesspools as though pure soap had anything to do with purity . That was the sole lesson of their world : how to make waste , how to make machines that made more waste , how to make wasteful products , how to talk waste , how to study waste , how to design waste , how to cure people who were sickened by waste so they could be well enough to endure it , how to mobilize waste ,  |p204legalize  waste and how to despise the culture that lived in cloth houses and shit on the ground far away from where they ate . And it would drown them one day , they would all sink into their own waste and the waste they had made of the world and then , finally they would know true peace and the happiness they had been looking for all along . In the meantime this one here would chew a morsel of ham and drink white wine secure in the knowledge that he had defecated on two people who had dared to want some of his apples . And Jadine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helping of this , a dab of that and smiled when she did not have to . Soothed down any disturbance that might fluster him ; quieted even the mild objections her own aunt raised , and sat next to him more alive and responsive and attentive than even his own wife was , basking in the cold light that came from one of the killers of the world . Jadine who should know better , who had been to schools and seen some of the world and who ought to know better than any of them because she had been made by them , coached by them and should know by heart the smell of their huge civilized latrines . Sydney closed his knife and fork and said , " Other folks steal and they get put in the guest room . " Jadine shot a look at Son and said , " Uncle Sydney , please . " " It 's true , ai n't it ? We were slighted by taking in one thief and now we are slighted by letting another go . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We are actually quarreling about apples . " " It is not about apples , Mrs. Street , " said Sydney quietly . " I just think we should have been informed . We would have let them go ourselves , probably . This way , well . . . " He looked as if even staying on at the table let alone the job was hopeless . Valerian , at the head of his Christmas table , looked at the four black people ; all but one he knew extremely well , all but one ,  |p205and  even that one was in his debt . Across from him at the bottom of the table sat Son who thought he knew them all very well too , except one and that one was escaping out of his hands , and that one was doing the bidding of her boss and " patron . " Keeping the dinner going smoothly , quietly chastising everybody including her own uncle and aunt , soothing Margaret , agreeing with Valerian and calling Gideon Yardman and never taking the trouble to know his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Valerian and Valerian looked back . The evening eyes met those of the man with savannas in his face . The man who respected industry looked over a gulf at the man who prized fraternity . So he said to Valerian , in a clear voice , " If they had asked , would you have given them some of the apples ? " The whole table looked at Son as if he were crazy . " Of course , " said Valerian . " Some , surely , but they did n't ask ; they took . Do you know how many Americans here want special treats and goodies from the consulate ? Especially at Christmas . They sent us one crate , and those two , along with that girl they bring , took them , or tried to . I stopped them . Besides , it was n't the apples alone . It was the way they acted when I caught them . After trying to lie out of it , they did n't even apologize . They got arrogant  --  the woman called me names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I fired them . Those apples came at great expense and inconvenience from the consulate . I do n't see what the problemis . " " Inconvenience for who ? " Son asked . " You did n't go and get them . They did . You did n't row eighteen miles to bring them here . They did . " " Surely you do n't expect me to explain my actions , defend them to you ? " " You should explain it to somebody . Two people are going to starve so your wife could play American mama and fool around in the kitchen . "  | " Keep me out of it , please , " said Margaret . " Precisely , " said Valerian . His evening eyes had a touch of menace . " You keep my wife out of this . I rather think you have caused her enough mischief . " Somewhere in the back of Valerian 's mind one hundred French chevaliers were roaming the hills on horses . Their swords were in their scabbards and their epaulets glittered in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the security of the Napoleonic Code . Somewhere in the back of Son 's mind one hundred black men on one hundred unshod horses rode blind and naked through the hills and had done so for hundreds of years . They knew the rain forest when it was a rain forest , they knew where the river began , where the roots twisted above the ground ; they knew all there was to know about the island and had not even seen it . They had floated in strange waters blind , but they were still there racing each other for sport in the hills behind this white man 's house . Son folded his hands before his jawline and turned his savanna eyes on those calm head-of-a-coin evening ones . " Whatever mischiefI did , " he said , " it was n't enough to make you leave the table to find out about it . " " You will leave this house , " said Valerian . " Now . " " I do n't think so , " said Son . Margaret raised her hand and touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Valerian . Let 's just . . . " " It 's not all right ! Whose house is this ? " " We got them back , " she said . " I made the ollieballen with them . " Her voice was limp . Maybe if they all just ignored that " I do n't think so , " it would disappear . It did n't . It clicked like a key opening a lock . " That 's not the point ! " " Well , what is the point , I 'd like to know . It 's Christmas . . . " " I am being questioned by these people , as if , as if I could be called into question ! " Jadine spoke . " Valerian , Ondine 's feelings were hurt . That 's all.  | " By what , pray ? By my removing a pair of thieves from my house ? " " No , by not telling her , " said Margaret . " So what ? All of a sudden I 'm beholden to a cook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . " Ondine had been watching the exchanges with too bright eyes , chagrined by Margaret 's defense of her interests . Having caused all the trouble , now she was pretending that Ondine was the source of the dispute . " I may be a cook , Mr. Street , but I 'm a persontoo . " " Mr. Street , " said Sydney , " my wife is as important to me as yours is to you and should have the same respect . " " More , " said Ondine . " I should have more respect . I am the one who cleans up her shit ! " " Ondine ! " Both Sydney and Valerian spoke at once . " This is impossible ! " Valerian was shouting . " I 'll tell it , " said Ondine . " Do n't push me , I 'll tell it . " " Nanadine ! Get hold of yourself ! " Jadine pushed her chair back as though to rise . " I 'll tell it . She wants to meddle in my kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Your kitchen ? Your help ? " Valerian was astonished . " Yes my kitchen and yes my help . If not mine , whose ? " " You are losing your mind ! " shouted Valerian . Ondine was fuming now . " The first time in her life she tries to boil water and I get slapped in the face . Keep that bitch out of my kitchen . She 's not fit to enter it . She 's no cook and she 's no mother . " Valerian stood up . " If you do n't leave this room I 'll . . . " ' It was the second time he ordered a dismissal and the second time it held no force . " What ? You 'll what ? " asked Ondine . " Leave ! " said Valerian . " Make me , " said Ondine . " You do n't work here anymore , " he said.  | " Oh , yeah ? Who 's going to feed you ? Her ? " She pointed uptableat Margaret . " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . And away from her . " Margaret picked up her glass and threw it . The Evian splashed on the cloth and some got on Ondine 's chiffon dress . As the others jumped up from their seats , Ondine slipped out of her zircon-studded shoes and raced around the table at the target of all her anger . The real target , who would not be riled until now when she got fed up with the name-calling and shot her water glass across the table . " Do n't you come near me ! " Margaret shouted , but Ondine did and with the back of her hand slapped Margaret across the face . " Call the harbor ! " shouted Valerian , but again there was no one to do his bidding . He had played a silly game , and everyone was out of place . Margaret touched her flaming cheek and then rose up from her chair like a red-topped geyser and grabbed Ondine 's braids , forced her head down to the table where she would have banged it except for the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son who managed to separate them . Sydney was shaking and saying , " 0 Lord 0 Lord . " Valerian was shaking and saying nothing  --  his evening eyes gone dawn with rage . Held tightly in the arms of Son , Ondine was shouting wildly , " You white freak ! You baby killer ! I saw you ! I saw you ! You think I do n't know what that apple pie shit is for ? " Jadine had a hard time holding back Margaret , who was shouting , " Shut up ! Shut up ! You nigger ! You nigger bitch ! Shut your big mouth , I 'll kill you ! " " You cut him up . You cut your baby up . Made him bleed for you . For fun you did it . Made him scream , you , you freak . You crazy white freak . She did , " Ondine addressed the others , still shouting . " She stuck pins in his behind . Burned him with cigarettes . Yes , she did , I saw her ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p209Valerian  held on to the table edge as though it were the edge of the earth . His face was truly white and his voice cracked a little as he asked , " Burned . . . who ? " " Your son ! Your precious Michael . When he was just a baby . A wee wee little bitty baby . " Ondine started to cry . " I used to hold him and pet him . He was so scared . " Her voice was hardly audible under the sobbing . " All the time scared . And he wanted her to stop . He wanted her to stop so bad . And every time she 'd stop for a while , but then I 'd see him curled up on his side , staring off . After a while  --  after a while he did n't even cry . And she wants him home . . . for Christmas and apple pie . A little boy who she hurt so much he ca n't even cry . " She broke down then and said no more . Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and picked up a table napkin so she could wipe her streaming eyes with it instead of with the backs and the palms of her hands . Sydney led her barefoot , her diadem braids turned into horns , away from the table . Margaret was standing as still and as straight as a pillar . There were tears in her eyes but her beautiful face was serene . They could hear Ondine 's cries all the way into the first kitchen and down the stairs to the apartment of second-hand furniture . " Yes my kitchen . Yes my kitchen . I am the woman in this house . None other . As God is my witness there is none other . Not in this house . " Margaret serene and lovely stared ahead at nobody . " I have always loved my son , " she said . " I am not one of those women in the National Enquirer . " " THAT WAS AWFUL , awful , " said Jadine . She was holding Son 's hand as they walked up the stairs . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valerian was looking at Margaret and she was looking at nobody . So the two of them left as soon as Ondine and Sydney did . Jadine would not admit to herself that she was rattled , but her fingertips were ice-cold inp210Son 's hand . She wanted a little human warmth , some unsullied person to be near , someone to be with , so she took his hand without thinking about it and said , " That was awful ! " " Yes , " he said . " What happened ? We all went crazy . Do you think it 's true ? What Nanadine said ? She would n't make up anything like that . " They were at Jadine 's bedroom door and went in . Still holding hands . In the center of the room , Jadine stopped , released his hand and turned to face him . She pressed her fingers together in front of her lips . " Awful , " she said frowning , looking at the floor . " Do n't think about it . It 's over . " Jadine put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . They 're fired for sure . Tomorrow will be terrible . God , how can I wake up in the morning and face that ? I wo n't be able to sleep at all . Maybe I should go down and see about her ? " " Ondine ? " " Yes . " " Leave her alone with Sydney . You should n't bother them now . " I wish I could figure it out , what got into everybody . " Son put his arm around her ; she was like a bird in the crook of his arm . " What does it mean ? " She closed her eyes . " It means , " he said , talking into her hair , " that white folks and black folks should not sit down and eat together . " " Oh , Son . " Jadine looked up at him and smiled a tiny smile . " It 's true , " he said . " They should work together sometimes , but they should not eat together or live together or sleep together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put her head back into his shirt front . " What 'll we do now ? " " Sleep , " he said . " I ca n't sleep . It was so ugly . Did you see the faces ? " Son kissed her cheek , bending his neck down low . " It 's true , is n't it ? She stuck pins into Michael , and Ondinep211knew it and did n't tell anybody all this time . Why did n't she tell somebody ? " " She 's a good servant , I guess , or maybe she did n't want to lose her job . " He kissed the other cheek . " I always wondered why she hated Margaret so . Every time she could she would jab at her . " " Sleep , " he said , and kissed her eyelids . " You need sleep . " " Will you sleep with me ? " she asked . " I will , " he said . " I mean really sleep . I 'm not up to anything else . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrible , Son . Terrible . I do n't want to thinkabout it , but I know I will and I do n't want to do it alone . " " I know . I 'll stay with you . You sleep and I 'll watch you . " Jadine stepped back from him . " Oh , the hell with it . Youwo n't . You 'll start something and I 'm not up to it . " " Relax . Stop imagining things . You want somebody to be with tonight , so I 'll do it . Do n't complicate it . " " You start something and I 'll throw you out . " " All right . Take off your dress and get in the bed . " Jadine folded her arms behind her and unzipped the top part of her dress . He reached behind her and pulled it the rest of the way down . Jadine stepped out of it and sat down on the bed . " No foolishness , Son . I 'm serious . " Her voice sounded small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began unbuttoning his shirt . Jadine sat on the bed and watched him . Then , for the first time . she saw his huge hands . One hand alone was big enough for two . A fingerspread that could reach from hither to yon . The first time she had been aware of his hands they were clasped over his head under Sydney 's gun , so she had not really seen them . The second time was at the beach when he touched the bottom of her foot with one finger . She had not looked then either , only felt that fingerprint in the arch of her sole . Now she could not help looking , seeing those hands large enough to sit down in . Largep212enough to hold your whole head . Large enough , maybe , to put your whole self into . " I hope you are serious , " she said . She left her panties on and got under the sheet . Son undressed completely and Jadine shot him a quick look to see if he had an erection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to meddle me and all I want is rest . " " Be quiet , " he said . " I 'm not meddling you . I ca n't control that , but I can control whether I meddle you . " He walked to the bed and got in next to her . " Well , how am I supposed to sleep with you taking up half the sheet in that tent ? " " Do n't think about it and it 'll go away . " " I 'll bet . You sound like a character in those blue comics . " " Hush . " Jadine turned round on her stomach and then her side , with her back to him . After a silence during which she listened for but could not hear his breathing , she said , " Have you slept with anybodysince you jumped ship ? " " Yes . " " You have ? " She raised her head . " Who ? I mean where ? " " In town . " " Oh ho . " She put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ca n't remember her name . " " Men . Why ca n't you remember her name ? Did n't Yardman tell you her name ? " " Gideon . " " Gideon . Did n't he introduce you ? " " Go to sleep , Jadine . " " I ca n't . I 'm tired , but not sleepy . " " You 're agitated . Calm down . " " You wo n't bother me ? I do n't want to wrestle . " " I wo n't bother you . I 'll just be here while you sleep , just like I said I would . " " I 'm not up to any fucking . "  | " For somebody who 's not up to it , you sure bring it up a lot . " " I know what 's going to happen . I 'll fall asleep and then I 'll feel something cold on my thigh . " " Nothing cold is going to be on your thigh . " " I just do n't want to fuck , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? If I wanted to make love , I 'd ask you . " I did n't say make love , I said  --  " " I know what you said . " " You do n't like me to use that word , do you ? Men . " " Go to sleep . Nobody 's talking about fucking or making love but you . " " Admit it . You do n't like me to say fuck . " " No . " " Hypocrite . " Son thought he must have had this conversation two million times . It never varied , this dance . Except when you paid your money and there was no seduction involved . Free stuff was always a pain in the ass , and it annoyed him that this conversation should be taking place with this sponge-colored girl with mink eyes whom he was certain he could not live in the world without . He wished she would either fall asleep , throw him out or jump him . " Listen , " he said , " I 'm not a hypocrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " What do you call it ? " Jadine turned over and lay on her back . " I do n't call it anything . I do n't have the language for it . " " Why not ? " " I just do n't . It 's not love-making and it 's not fucking . " " If it 's not making love , it 's because you do n't love me and you said at the beach that you did . " " I said that because I do n't know how else to say it . If I had another way , I 'd have used it . Whatever I want to do to you  --  that 's not it . " " What do you want to do to me ? I mean if you had the language what would you do ? "  | " I 'd make you close your eyes , " he said , and when he did n't add anything Jadine raised up on her elbows . Is that all ? " " Then I 'd ask you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see anything . " " Nothing ? " " Nothing . " " Not even the dark ? " " Oh , yes , that . " " Is it all dark ? Nothing else ? No lights moving around ? No stars ? No moon ? " " No . Nothing . Just black . " " Imagine something . Something that fits in the dark . Say the dark is the sky at night . Imagine something in it . " " A star ? " " Yes . " " I ca n't . I ca n't see it . " " Okay . Do n't try to see it . Try to be it . Would you like to know what it 's like to be one ? Be a star ? " " A movie star ? " " No , a star star . In the sky . Keep your eyes closed , think about what it feels like to be one . " He moved over to her and kissed her shoulder . " Imagine yourself in that dark , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You are by yourself , just shining there . You know how a star is supposed to twinkle ? We say twinkle because that is how it looks , but when a star feels itself , it 's not a twinkle , it 's more like a throb . Star throbs . Over and over and over . Like this . Stars just throb and throb and throb and sometimes , when they ca n't throb anymore , when they ca n't hold it anymore , they fall out of the sky . "  |p215The  BLACK GIRLS in New York City were crying and their men were looking neither to the right nor to the left . Not because they were heedless , or intent on what was before them , but they did not wish to see the crying , crying girls split into two parts by their tight jeans , screaming at the top of their high , high heels , straining against the pull of their braids and the fluorescent combs holding their hair . Oh , their mouths were heavy with plum lipstick and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crying and nothing could persuade their men to look to the right or look to the left . They stoked their cocks into bikini underwear and opened their shirts to their tits . But they walked on tippy-toe through the streets looking straight ahead , and Son looked in vain for children . He could n't find them anywhere There were short people and people under twelve years of age , but they had no child 's vulnerability , no unstucklaughter . They cracked into the M2 bus like terrified bison running for their lives , for fear the school at their backs would grab them and eat them up one more time . It was n't until he caught the downtown A that he saw what they had done with their childhood . They had wrapped it in dark cloth , sneaked it underground and thrown it all over the trains . Like blazing jewels , the subway cars burst from the tunnels to the platforms shining with the recognizable artifacts of childhood : fantasy , magic , ego , energy , humor and paint . They had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Yard Boys . Teen , P-Komet and Popeye . He sat on a bench at the Fifty-ninth Streetp216station watching the childhood flash by . Now all he needed to know was where were the old people . Where were the Thereses and Gideons of New York ? They were not on the subways and they were not in the street . Perhaps they were all in kennels . That must be the reason the men walked that way  --  on tippy-toe looking neither to the right nor to the left . The old people were in kennels and childhood was underground . But why were all the black girls crying on buses , in Red Apple lines , at traffic lights and behind the counters of Chemical Bank ? Crying from a grief so stark you would have thought they 'd been condemned to death by starvation in the lobby of Alice Tully Hall . Death by starvation in Mikell 's , death by starvation on the campus of C.U.N.Y. And death by starvation at the reception desks of large corporations . It depressed him , all that crying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin gay lines over their eyes . Who did this to you ? Who has done this thing to you ? he wondered , as he walked down Columbus Avenue looking first to the right and then to the left . The street was choked with beautifulmales who had found the whole business of being black and men at the same time too difficult and so they 'd dumped it . They had snipped off their testicles and pasted them to their chests ; they put the weighty wigs Alma Estee dreamed of on their heads and feathery eyelashes on their eyes . They flung sharp hips away to the right and away to the left and smiled sweetly at the crying girls and the men on tippy-toe . Only the Hilton whores seemed to him quiet and feeling no pain . He had tried a little television that first day , but the black people in whiteface playing black people in blackface unnerved him . Even their skin had changed through the marvel of color TV . A gray patina covered them all and they were happy . Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound of their televised laughter was enough to tell him so . Different laughter from what he remembered it to be  --  without irony or defiance or genuine amusement . Now all he heard were shrieks of satisfaction . It made him shiver . How long had he been gone , anyway ? If thosep217were the black folks he was carrying around in his heart all those years , who on earth was he ? The trouble he 'd had the night he checked in was representative of how estranged he felt from these new people . The Hickey Freeman suit passed muster easily enough , and he wadded Jadine 's four hundred dollars in his fist as he approached the desk . The clerk was about to give him a very hard time because no , he would not be paying with a credit card , and no , no check either . Cash . Two nights . Cash . Son had chosen that line to wait in because the clerk 's little pecan-pie face looked friendly ; now he realized the boy was in love with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom misjudged people . He thought the love thing with Jadine must have thrown his sensibilities off , derailed his judgment , so he leaned toward the clerk and whispered , " Brother , do you want to get home tonight ? This ai n't your fuckin hotel . " But now he thought it was less an error in judgment than it was being confronted with a whole new race of people he was once familiar with . He was heart-weary when he opened the door to his room , and the purple carpet fairly took his breath away . He wanted her in that room with him giving him the balance he was losing , the ballast and counterweight to the stone of sorrow New York City had given him . Jadine would lighten up the purple carpet , soften the tooth-white walls . She 'd read the room-service menu as though it were a private message to them both and then choose a corner of the room to make love in . They had spent two whole days following the Christmas dinner in or near each other 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both under ; stood that Son had to get out fast , so he used Jadine 's ticket and Gideon 's passport , and split . She was to follow as soon as she could get a flight and had seen what Ondine 's and Sydney 's situation was  --  whether they would stay or leave . He sat down in a plastic tub chair , rested his arms on the windowsill and looked down at Fifty-third Street . How hard this one night 's wait would be , shot full already of fallen airplanesp218and missed connections . Even if he managed to sleep from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. , what would he do with the morning ? Refuseto have breakfast until nine ; shave long and shower longer till noon when Air France would glide like a crane into Kennedy . Did she say baggage claim or lobby ? Or did she say to wait at the hotel ? His mouth went suddenly dry with the possibility of losing her in that city . Was he in the right hotel ? Was it the New York Hilton or the Statler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to call and find out without letting Sydney know . He might answer the phone himself , or Ondine might , and if they knew she was joining him , they both might try to stop her . He could call Gideon . He tried to remember that hillside hut , but all he could summon were the powder pink walls and the record player sitting on a shelf . Gideon had no telephone , but messages got to him via a store halfway down the hill that sold rum and meat pies and lent out hair clippers . That was foolish . What could Gideon tell him anyway ? He was so angry at the Americans , he was actually helping Therese prepare all sorts of potions and incantations for their destruction , just in case there was such a thing as magic after all . And he was quite willing to lend his passport to the man who shared his anger at the Americans . He could not understand why Son wanted to return to the country too terrible for dying , but he agreed that one black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years would not be noticed in a black man 's five-year-old passport . Therese gave Son , as a going-away present , a tiny , dirty bag of good fortune , but he tossed it away  --  it looked like ganja and he did n't want to draw any attention to himself at customs . He took what Jadine gave him and left . Now , on the second day of their separation he would just have to wait and keep on imaginingdisaster since his emotions were so young that this heavy , grown-up love made him feel fresh-born , unprecedented , surrounded by an extended present loaded with harm . There was nothing to do ; he would have to trust to her city-sense to do the right thing and be in the right places . Andp219this time tomorrow he could smooth back her hair and sweep her eyebrows with his thumb . This time tomorrow the side teeth in her smile would divert him from what she was saying or laughingat . He loved to watch her eyes when she was not watching his . And to listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees back and forth like a schoolboy . Not thinking most of the important things there were to think about : What would they do ? Where would they go , live ? How would he earn money to take care of her and , later , their children ? He smiled at the vigor of his own heartbeat at the thought of her having his baby . Watch her . He would watch her stomach while she slept just the way he had when he 'd lived like an animal around the house and spent the hind part of the night at her bedside pressing his dreams into hers . Now those dreams embarrassedhim . The mewings of an adolescent brutalized by loneliness for a world he thought he would never see again . There was a future . A reason for hauling ass in the morning . No more moment to moment play-it-as-it-comes existence . That stomach required planning . Thinking through a move long before it was made . What would he name his son ? Son of Son ? He should have thought about that before he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry and the passport of a stranger instead of a friend . Instead he took the clothes , one piece of luggage and the Bally shoes and his bottle of Paco Rabannc . He saw it all as a rescue : first tearing her mind away from that blinding awe . Then the physical escape from the plantation . His first , hers to follow two days later . Unless . . . he remembered sitting at the foot of the table , gobbling the food , watching her pour his wine , listening to her take his part , trying to calm Ondine and Sydney to his satisfaction . Just as she had done the first night when they found him in the closet . He would not look at her then  --  refused to lock with those mink-dark eyes that looked at him with more distaste than Valerian 's had . The mocking voice , the superior managerial , administrative , **33;8498;TOOLONG she took . Gatekeeper , advance bitch , house-bitch ,  |p220welfare  office torpedo , corporate cunt , tar baby side-of-the-road whore trap , who called a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who could n't give a shit who he himself was and only wanted his name to file away in her restrung brain so she could remember it when the cops came to fill out the report  --  five eleven , maybe six feet , black as coal with the breath and table manners of a rhino . But underneath her efficiency and know-it-all sass were wind chimes . Nine rectangles of crystal , rainbowed in the light . Fragile pieces of glass tinkling as long as the breeze was gentle . But in more vigorous weather the thread that held it together would snap . So it would be his duty to keep the climatemild for her , to hold back with his hands if need be thunder , drought and all manner of winterkill , and he would blow with his own lips a gentle enough breeze for her to tinkle in . The birdlikedefenselessness he had loved while she slept and saw when she took his hand on the stairs was his to protect . He would have to be alert , feed her with his mouth if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for her to flourish in , for the love thing was alreadythere . He had been looking for her all his life , and even when he thought he had found her , in other ports and other places , he shied away . He stood in her bedroom , a towel wrapped around his waist . Clean as a whistle , having just said the nastiest thing he could think of to her . Staring at a heart-red tree desperatelyin love with a woman he could not risk loving because he could not afford to lose her . For if he loved and lost this woman whose sleeping face was the limit his eyes could safely behold and whose wakened face threw him into confusion , he would surely lose the world . So he made himself disgusting to her . Insultedand offended her . Gave her sufficient cause to help him keep his love in chains and hoped to God the lock would hold . It snapped like a string . He stood up , searching for the anger that had shaken him so that first time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crying girls and men on tippy-toe , he could not find it . Even conjuring up that head-of-a-coin profile , the unfleshed skinp221and evening eyes , was not a vivid enough memory to produce it . He needed the blood-clot heads of the bougainvillea , the simple green rage of the avocado , the fruit of the banana trees puffed up and stiff like the fingers of gouty kings . Here prestressed concrete and steel contained anger , folded it back on itself to become a craving for things rather than vengeance . Still , he thought of it not just as love , but as rescue . He took off his clothes and filled the tub , smiling to think of what the leaden waves of the Atlantic had become in the hands of civilization . The triumph of ingenuitythat had transferred the bored treachery of the sea into a playful gush of water that did exactly what it was told . And why not ? Wilderness was n't wild anymore or threatening ; wildlife needed human protection to exist at all . Stretched out in the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have remembered . Where was the wavysevenlanguage on the windows of the butcher shops ? The laundries named Hand . What had they done to the Apollo ? Where was Michaux 's , the awnings on St. Nicholas Avenue ? Who were these people on the islands in the middle of Broadway and where were the trees ? There used to be trees . Trees coming out of the concrete . But nobody would chop down a tree in New York , so he guessed he must have been wrong . That must have been some other city he had been memorizing . JADINE sat in the taxi barely able to see over her luggage piled in the seat in front of her . Unlike the anxiety-ridden man in a Hilton bathtub , she wanted to giggle . New York made her feel like giggling , she was so happy to be back in the arms of that barfly with the busted teeth and armpit breath . New York oiled her joints and she moved as though they were oiled . Her legs were longer here , her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of stingless bees , butterflies and avocado trees , the smart thin trees on Fifty-third Street refreshed her . They were to scale , human-sized , and the buildings did notp222threaten her like the hills of the island had , for these were full of people whose joints were oiled just like hers . This is home , she thought with an orphan 's delight ; not Paris , not Baltimore , not Philadelphia . This is home . The city had gone on to something more interesting to it than the black people who had fascinatedit a decade ago , but if ever there was a black woman 's town , New York was it . No , no , not over there making land-use decisions , or deciding what was or was not information . But there , there , there and there . Snapping whips behind the tellers ' windows , kicking ass at Con Edison offices , barking orders in the record companies , hospitals , public schools . They refused loans at Household Finance , withheld unemployment checks and drivers ' licenses , issued parking tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady do n't make me mad . They jacked up meetings in boardrooms , turned out luncheons , energized parties , redefined fashion , tipped scales , removed lids , cracked covers and turned an entire telephone company into such a diamondhead of hostility the company paid you for not talking to their operators . The manifesto was simple : " Talk shit . Take none . " Jadine remembered and loved it all . This would be her city too , her place , the place she spent a whole summer once in love with Oom . Riding the subways looking for his name , first as a talisman , then as a friend and finally as a lover in the tunnels of New York City . And now she would take it ; take it and give it to Son . They would make it theirs . She would show it , reveal it to him , live it with him . They would fall out of Max 's Kansas City at 4:00 a.m. ; they would promenade Third Avenue from the Fifties to SoHo ; they would fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie on I 35th Street , paella on Eighty-first Street ; they would laugh in the sex boutiques , eat yogurt on the steps of the Forty-second Street library ; listen to RVR and BLS , buy mugs in Azuma 's , chocolate chip cookies in Grand Central Station , drink margaritas at Suggs , and shop Spanish and West Indian at the Park Avenue Market . She would look up Dawnp223and Betty and Aisha and show him off : her fine frame , her stag , her man . Jadine was so ruttish by the time she got to the Hilton , she could barely stand still for the doorman to take her bags , and when she was checked in , and had gotten his room number from information , she did not call him  --  she took the elevator to his floor and banged on the door . When he opened it , she jumped on him with her legs around his waist crashing him into the purple carpet . But he insisted on Eloe . In spite of the Gate and Central Park in the snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four months while she was on the Coast shooting her seventh pilot , the one that was sure to stick . Four months in that apartment of long and bristling winter days when he slowed her down to the speed of a tulip . Murky New York days when she spun him like a top until he slammed into the headboard . He met her women friends  --  girls who talked with their shoulders , and found them less than she ; he met her men friends  --  alight with success , almost rich  --  and found them less than he . Everybody was ridiculous , maimed or unhappy to them , so satisfied were they with their mutual adoration . He thought he would have to stamp the ground , paw it and butt horns with every male they came in contact with , but he did n't . Her devotion surprised him ; she looked only at him and grew her own horns when other men got out of line . She was startled and pleased to discover that his beauty , so sudden and impressive on Isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitresses and the eyes of passersby had not already told her , her own friends altered as well in his presence . Dawn went completely Annie Rooney , falling all over herself with helplessness , and generosity . Betty , who had been " into " bisexuality for six months , could n't get back into the closet fast enough when Son was in the room , and when Jadine told Son about Betty 's range of interests , she was angry enough to fight . Still he insisted on Eloe . Even after she earned $2,500 for fourp224walks and a picture spread all in two weeks and they bought each other pretty things . Even after he worked the bar three afternoons at a fashion show where he got the drinks mixed up , dropped a fifth of gin , and Leonard , the old man who had taken him on as a favor to Jadine , shook his head in disbelief . Son took six bottles of leftovdr champagne , the S150 , and gave it all to her . They got swinging drunk and Jadine laughed in his ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober too . And he let her be still and cry after she told him about her mother and the awful hat she 'd worn to the funeral . Too big and grown-up for a little girl of twelve . She poured her heart out to him and he to her . Dumb things , secret things , sin and heroism . They told each other all of it . Or all they could . He told her what she wished to hear about the war . He could not speak to her or anyone about it coherently so he told her what she wished to hear : no , he never killed anybody " with his hands " ; yes , he was wounded and he showed her a burn on his skin from a burst boiler to prove it ; yes , he had been afraid , although in truth he had not been , or had not been properly frightened . He had laughed , in fact , laughed all over Vietnam because at eighteen laughter was his only reliable weapon . It was still early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded too soon or not at all , laughter was always there , almost always ; but one day it ran out too , as unreliable as his fucked-up M-i.4 . The silence in his throat where laughter or tears ought to be blew up in his head and he was stockaded , busted and , when he refused to re-up , discharged without honor or humor . He went to Eloe , married Cheyenne , left the set early when a fistfight broke out and found his sleeping wife sleeping with a teenager . He was silent then too as he ran his car through the house and the bed caught on fire . He pulled them both out  --  the teenager and Cheyenne  --  but she did n't make it . He watched her wrappings but not her eyes in the hospital and still no sound . It was hearing about Frisco blowing up in a gas field . Old nogoodFrisco who used to pay him to clean fish . That did it . Hisp225father told him the news when he met him at the bus stop across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to write ; and told him about Frisco . In a tiny toilet at the rear of the bus , Son cried like an infant for all the blowings up in Asia . Jadine kissed his hands and he asked her why she left the States in the first place . She said she always thought she had three choices : marry a dope king or a doctor , model , or teach art at Jackson High . In Europe she thought there might be a fourth choice . They told each other everything . Yet he insisted on Eloe . She listened to him and nodded , thinking anywhere with him would be all right . She was completely happy . After all those sexuallyefficient men , all those foreplay experts and acrobats , and the nonverbal equipment men , his wildness and fumbling , his corny unself-conscious joy was like blue-sky water . Show me again what it 's like to be shining all alone in the sky . And he did that , and he did more . Regarding her whole self as an ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing fish , The Fox and the Stork , The Monkey and the Lion , The Spider Goes to Market , and so mingled was their sex with adventureand fantasy that to the end of her life she never heard a reference to Little Red Riding Hood without a tremor . They thought about Isle des Chevaliers sometimes . He would say " ollieballen " and she would scream with laughter . She wrote two misleading postcards to Ondine and Sydney . Got a short , sorrowful , somewhat accusatory letter back which she refused to let sour her happiness . Her leave-taking had been difficult . She was dependent at last on that mulatto with a leer sent by Dr. Michelin as the new yard boy . The Streets seemed not to notice or mind her going . Only Ondine and Sydney were cut up about it . She promised to send for them as soon as they wanted her to , but she had to take this gig , she told them , and she left the two sullen and confused old people at the kitchen table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York trip , she said , was vital if she were to arrange things so all three could live together . She could n't let them know who waited at the Hilton.  |p226Son  and Jadine discussed their situation in Dawn 's apartment . Ondine arid Sydney seemed unsure of their jobs , but no steps had been taken to let them go , it seemed . Son was less than sympatheticto Ondine 's plight because she had acted too shuffle-footed  --  keeping her white lady 's secret " lak it wuz hern " and loving her white lady 's baby " lak it wuz hem , too . " And much less sympatheticto Sydney because in thirty years he had not split Valerian 's skull . Eighty percent of both Sydney 's and Ondine 's conversation was the caprice and habits of their master . " You still like that old man , do n't you ? " Son asked her . " Who ? Valerian ? " " Yes . " " He put me through school , I told you . " " Nothing in return ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " " And Margaret ? " he asked . " How did she treat you ? " " Okay . She was more distant than he was , but she was nice to me . Nice enough anyway . " " She was n't very nice to your folks , " he said . " Actually , she was , " Jadine answered . " They both were . At least from what I could see of it . That 's why I was so took-out that day . I could n't believe it . They fought like we did in grade school . " " Wild , " he said , thinking of rescue . " Really wild . " Jadine let two of her fingers do the Charleston in the hair of his chest . " We 'll get rich and send for them and live happily ever after , " she said , and thought it was so , but not right this minute , not today , there was so much nestling to do . They had only two months left in the apartment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over like a fourth grade Girl Scout and he finally got around to telling her he wanted some body hair . But they needed time for it to grow . Much more time . Time for her to sketch him right for once . But why sketch when she could touch ? Time to make a genuine paella ; time for her to finish the macrame plant holder , for himp227to fix the dishwasher . They must have been in love  --  they never once turned on the television . They forgot to buy cigarettes or alcohol and they did n't even jog in the park . There was n't a permanent adult job in the whole of the city for him , so he did teenager 's work on occasion and pieces of a grown man 's work . He spoke to the men at the shape-up halls . The black men told him Baltimore . Everybody works on the docks in Baltimore . Or Galveston , or San Diego or New Orleans or Savannah . New York  --  not a chance . There was a little pilferingmoney  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brute work , look-out work , and sometimes he dropped payoffswhen asked . But none of it could hold his attention and one afternoon while he was helping a trucker unload boxes on Broadwayand i o i st Street , he heard a commotion in the traffic . A young girl with a shaved head and a small ring in her nostril was cursing a man right in the middle of the street . The man , who looked African or West Indian to Son by the innocent confusion in his face , stood watching her in silence . Two or three of his friends leaned on cars , looking elsewhere but obviously waiting for the finale . The girl was in jeans , platform shoes and a thin sweater . She had the voice of a sergeant and her language was nasty enough to be memorable . Cars honked at them before swerving into parallel lanes ; pedestrians glanced and then pretendedthey were n't there . Only Son and people in second-story windows gave them their undivided attention. - It was beyond embarrassment . The girl 's face was as tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement . But inside her narrowedangry eyes were many other eyes  --  some of them hurt , some brave , some just lonely hollow-eyes , and her shaved head reminded Son of his sister . He listened to the abuse , the catalog of shame and rage until the man felt safe enough ( his back-up team still leaned on the cars ) to turn his back on her and walk away . None of which dulled the glitter of her nose ring or shut her mouth . She word-whipped him on down the street and probablywould have followed him to make it stick except Son , madep228miserable by the eyes inside her eyes , went over and stood in front of her with his arms wide open . She looked at him with hatred older than lava . " Come here , " he said . She did n't move , so he put his arms around her to shield her from the eyes of the second-story people and bank her fire . The girl bucked , but he would n't let her go . " You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me buy you a drink . " She tipped her foreheadonto his chest then , and began to cry . " Come on , " he said . " There 's a place down the block . " Arm around her shoulder , he led the way to a Chinese restaurant and ordered her gin . She drank and began to tell him about the man , but Son shook his head . " Do n't , " he said . " Do n't think about it . You got a place to stay ? " She said , " Not tonight , I do n't , " so he left the job hauling boxes and took her home . All three , Nommo , Jadine and Son , went to a delicatessen where , after much discussion , they bought potato chips , A &; W root beer , and three Payday candy bars with Son 's last ten-dollar bill . They ate it all in the snow . Cold and giggling they trudged back to the apartment where Son and Jadine slept like puppies and Nommo made off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She agreed but before they could make plans , she stubbed her big toe on a metal plate bolted to the middle of Sixth Avenue . By the time she got home , her toe was the size of a plum and very painful . Son made a splint for it out of emery boards and the ribbon from a Valentine candy box . All night he woke at half-hour intervals to bathe her toe in an Epsomsalt solution . In the morning , the swelling had decreased and he left for work while she slept . When she woke and hobbledto the bathroom she saw that he had drawn a happily obscene picture under the toilet lid . At his coffee break he called . " How 's your toe ? " " Lonely . " " Mine too . "  | " Come home for lunch . " " I only have thirty minutes for lunch , baby . " " Come anyway . " " I wo n't be able to get back in time . I 'll lose a half-day 's pay . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't report to work again until she could walk effortlessly . In the meantime they ate Chinese food in the tub . She read True Confessions stories to him with appropriate " white girl " voices and gestures and he laughed until his chest hurt . She read Cesaire to him and he closed his eyes . She read the sexy parts of the Bible and he looked at her . Gradually she came to feel unorphaned . He cherished and safeguarded her . When she woke in the night from an uneasy dream she had only to turn and there was the stability of his shoulder and his limitless , eternal chest . No part of her was hiddenfrom him . She wondered if she should hold back , keep something in store from him , but he opened the hair on her head with his fingers and drove his tongue through the part . There was nothing to forgive , nothing to win and the future was five minutesaway . Heunorphanedher completely . Gave her a brand-new childhood . They were the last lovers in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inefficient and kept no savings account . They spent it like Texans . When he had a sore throat so bad he could not speak , she put him to bed and drew a checker board on the inside of a Bergdorf box . They played the game with M &M's.; It did n't work because the crowns would n't stay still , so they used her Enovids instead , partly because of their plane surface and partly to keep her from eating the pieces jumped by her kings . She told him straight brandy was good for his throat and made him drink so much so fast , he passed out . She did n't like his being unconscious without her so she drank the rest and passed out with him . He woke first and vomited the strep away . After bathing and dressing , he watched her sleep . She woke unable to see , speak or move and he put his huge hand on her forehead until she could . They did n't go to parties any/more  --  other people interfered with their view of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ioth Street . They stopped laughing and began to smile at each other . From across the room , across the mattress , across the table . Their language diminished to code at times , and at others ballooned to monologues delivered while cradled in the other 's arms . They never looked at the sky or got up early to see a sunrise . They played no music and had n't the foggiest notion that spring was on its way . Vaguely aware of such things when they were apart , together they could not concentrate on the given world . They reinvented it , remembered it through the other . He looked at her face in the mirror and was reminded of days at sea when water looked like sky . She surveyedhis body and thought of oranges , playing jacks , and casks of green wine . He was still life , babies , cut glass , indigo , hand spears , dew , cadmium yellow , Hansa red , moss green and the recollection of a tree that wanted to dance with her . It was difficult to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they managed occasionally . She thought about calling her old professor who said he could always find work for her . But maybe May would be a better time to ring him  --  after exams . They discussed opening a retail flower shop and boutique that they could call Jade and Son ; they discussed bank robbery and an agency for black models ; they discussed the New School and Empire State and figured out a way to collect Gideon 's unemploymentchecks . But Jadine was not worried . She had $i , 94o in the bank , $5,000 in Paris and connections . If push came to shove , she 'd go permanent with an agency and work her behind off . The check scheme worked , but he had time to pick up just one check before they left hand-in-hand for Eloe.  |p231THE  nix was so charged with pain the angel trumpets could not breathe it . Rows of them wrinkled on the vine and fell unnoticedright in Valerian 's sightline . He sat in the greenhouse oblivious to everything but 1950 when he heard for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought she drank , was a not-so-secret alcoholic : the sleeping masks , the clumsiness , the beauty spa vacations , the withdrawals , the hard-to-wake mornings , the night crying , the irritability , the sloppy candy-kisses mother love . He thought she drank  --  heavily , in private , and that was why she took only wine and sherry in his presence . Nondrinkers take real drinks ; only secret drinkers insist on Chablis at every occasion  --  or so he thought . And he wished it were true . He was devastatedknowing that she had never been drunk , had never been " out of her mind , " never in a stupor , never hung-over , never manic from being dry too long . Drunkenness he could take , had taken , in fact , since he 'd always believed it . Anything was better than knowing that a pretty ( and pretty nice ) sober young woman had loved the bloodying of her own baby . Had loved it dearly . Had once locked herself in the bathroom , a pair of cuticle scissorsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing serious , though . No throwing across the room , or out of the window . No scalding , no fist work . Just a delicious pin-stab in sweet creamy flesh . That was her word , " delicious . " " I knew it was wrong , knew it was bad . But something about it was delicious too . " She was telling him , saying it aloud at the dinner tablep232after everyone had gone . His knees were trembling and he 'd had to sit down again . The Negroes had all gone out of the room , disappeared like bushes , trees , out of his line of vision , and left the two of them in the light of the chandelier . She was standing there next to him , her cheek white again after the blow Ondine had given her , her hair rumpled but lovely . She was serene standing there saying it , and he agreed with that , thought it could be , must be , true  --  that it was delicious , for at that moment it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carving knife lying on the platter next to the carcass of the goose and slashed into her lovely Valentine face . Delicious . Conclusive and delicious . But he could not concentrate . His knees were trembling , his fingers shuddering on the tablecloth . He did n't want to see them shaking there , but he did not want to see her face either . He thought about that  --  how or whether to stop looking at her and look instead at his hands . He could n't make up his mind and he could n't shift his gaze . But he thought about it while she was saying it . " It 's funny , but I would see the mark and hear him cry but somehow I did n't believe it hurt all that much . " " Mark " she called it . She saw the mark . Did n't think it hurt " all that much . " Like a laboratory assistant removing the spleen of a cute but comatose mouse . Suddenly he knew exactly what to do : go to him . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , hold him in his arms . Now . He tried to stand but the spastic legs defied him . " I can not hear anymore , " he said . " I ca n't . " She stopped then and looked at him with complete understanding and complete patience . Still he could not stand . She understood that too , and without another word walked slowly out of the room , " Later , " her footsteps seemed to say , " when you are stronger , I will say it to you . Share it with you . Make it yours as well as mine . " Valerian did not move . I will never be that strong , he thought . I will never be strong enough to hear it . I have to die now or gop233to him . When I move from this table I will do one or the other , nothing in between . I will never be able to hear it . It was two in the morning when Sydney returned dressed in robe , slippers and pajama bottoms . Valerian was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rest . " You should go on up to bed , Mr. Street . " Valerian gave a small shake of his head . If he went up he might never come down again and if he stood up it would only be to die or go to Michael . " Get some rest ; figure things out in the morning , " Sydney said . Valerian nodded . The table was precisely as it was when Sydney guided the sobbing Ondine away . No one had moved a thing while he helped Ondine undress , made her lie down and rubbed her feet until she slept . But he could not sleep at all . The sea spread around him and his wife . They were afloat in it and if removed from the island there was nowhere to land . They had no house , no place of their own . Some certificates worth a bit , but no savings . Just the promises of being taken care of in the will of a man whose wife his own wife had slapped . Sydney started to clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too great , so he asked him outright . " Mr. Street . " Valerian showed him his evening eyes , but did not speak . " You going to let us go ? " Valerian stared at Sydney trying to focus on , then comprehend , the question . " What ? " " Me and Ondine . You going to let us go ? " Valerian rested his forehead in his hand . " I do n't know . I do n't know anything , " he said , and Sydney had to be content for now with that answer spoken faintly , remotely , for Valerian , holding on to his head , fell back into the waxen horror Sydney had tried to penetrate . He was still there at six the next morn/ing . His eyes closed at last , his mind slowed to an occasional thud . He woke because nature required him to . Not to die or board an airplane headed for his son , but to go to the bathroom . So he did move from the table and he climbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , it was not unthinkable to attend to another  --  to rinse his face , clean his teeth , brush back his hair with his hands . He took off his shoes and sat on the bed holding them . The picture of the beautiful boy in the laundry underthe sink , singing because he could not speak or cry  --  because he had no vocabulary for what was happening to him , who sang la la la , la la la instead  --  that picture had stayed with Valerian all night , through fitful sleep , and was there between his stockingedfeet in the morning . I have to cry about this , Valerian thought . I have got to shed tears about this . But not water , please God , may they be blood . I have to cry blood tears for his wounds . But I will need several lives , life after life after life after life , one for each wound , one for every trickle of blood , for every burn . I will need a lifetime of blood tears for each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon lives for the the the the the . Hurt . The deep-down eternal little boy hurt . The not knowing when , the never knowingwhy , and never being able to shape the tongue to speak , let alone the mind to cogitate how the one person in the world upon whom he was totally , completely dependent  --  the one person he could not even choose not to love  --  could do that to him . Believingat last as a little boy would that he deserved it , must deserve it , otherwise it would not be happening to him . That no world in the world would be imagined , thought up , or even accidentally formed not to say say say say created that would permit such a thing to happen . And he is right . No world in the world would allow it . So this is not the world at all . It must be something else . I have lived in it and I will die out of it but it is not the world . This is not life . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that whatever this was it wasp235not life . He achieved a kind of blank , whited-out , no-feeling-at-all that he hoped would sustain him until the blood tears came . Until his heart , revivified , pumped its way along for a single purpose : to spill out of his eyes throughout the millennia he would have to live . Until then , then . Margaret awoke very early that morning , having had the dream she ought to have had : it was unspeakable . She rose at once ; the wonderful relief of public humiliation , the solid securityof the pillory , were upon her . Like the much-sought-after , finally captured , strangler , she wore that look of harmony that in newspaper photos comes across as arrogance , or impenitence at the least . The harmony that comes from the relieved discovery that the jig is up . The parts settle back into their proper places , and the strangler sighs , " Thank God I did n't get away scot-free . " She had no idea of what would be next , but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . That was the future , her job at hand was to reveal the past . Right now she had to wash her hair , hard . Soap it with mountains of lather , and rinse it over and over again . Then she sat in the sun against every instructionever given her about the care of her hair , and let it dry . L'Arbe de la Croix became a house of shadows . Couples locked into each other or away from each other , the murmurings of whose hearts rivaled the dreaming daisy trees . Jadine and Son off together plotting . Sydney and Online walking on glass shards , afraid , angry , sullen . Snapping at one another one minute , soothingeach other the next . Valerian stayed mostly in his room ; the greenhouse remained untended , the mail unread . Silence pressed down on the dahlias and cyclamen  --  for there was no diet of music anymore . Sydney brought pieces of dinner to the table but no one was there . Jadine and Son foraged in the refrigerator  --  accomplices . Margaret appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared sandwiches to Valerian 's room and brought them back untouched . Margaret told her husband in pieces . Little by little , shep236spooned it out to him a sip here a drop there . A fleeting sentence in midair as they passed on the stairs : " It was not as often as you think and there were long , long periods of happiness between us in between . " But he had stepped inside his bedroom door . Another time she said , " Do n't try to persuade yourself that I did n't love him . He was more important to me than my life . Than my life . " She had to repeat the phrase for his back was recedingfast . He never directed those gloaming eyes her way . She told him in bite-sized pieces , small enough for him to swallow quickly because she did not have the vocabulary to describe what she had come to know , remember . So there was no way or reason to describe those long quiet days when the sun was drained and nobody ever on the street . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neither Life nor Time could fill a morning . It started on a day like that . Just once she did it , a slip , and then once more , and it became the thing to look forward to , to resist , to succumb to , to plan , to be horrified by , to forget , because out of the doing of it came the reason . And she was outraged by that infant needfulness . There were times when she absolutely had to limit its being there ; stop its implicit and explicit demand for her best and constant self . She could not describe her loathingof its prodigious appetite for security  --  the criminal arrogance of an infant 's conviction that while he slept , someone is there ; that when he wakes , someone is there ; that when he is hungry , food will somehow magically be provided . So she told him that part that was palatable : that she could not control herself  --  which was true , for when she felt hostage to that massive insolence , that stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margaret entered his room one night and locked the door behind her . " I 've just spoken to Michael , " she said . Valerian could not believe it . She could call him ? Speak to him ? Say his name ? Did she think it was business as usual ? " He said he sent two cables telling us he could n't make it.  |p237Two  . Neither one was telephoned to us . I asked him to call B.J. Bridges . Obviously we do n't need any guests at New Year 's . " Valerian was speechless . She was going to go on about it , chatting about things just as if nothing had happened . The blood had not dropped out of his eyes yet , so this still was not life . He could get through it because it was some other thing he was living . " How dare you call him ? " he asked hoarsely . " How do you dare ? " " He is n't damaged , Valerian . He is n't . " Valerian said nothing ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her hair had no spray in it , that it was not torturedinto Art Deco , now that it hung according to its own will and the shape of her head . And she wore no make-up . Little charming eyebrows instead of styled ones , and the thin top lip was much nicer than the full one she ritually painted . " How can you know that ? How can you know what is damage and what is not ? If you do n't know the difference between betweenbetween between . " He stopped , he could not say it . " How do you know the difference between what is damaged and what is healed ? " " I know ; I see him ; I visit him . Believe me , he 's fine . Finer than most . " They were both silent for a few moments and then Margaret said , " You want to ask me why . Do n't . I ca n't answer that . I can tell you that I was more successful in keeping myself from doing it than not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . I thought at first it was because he was crying or would n't sleep . But then sometimes it was in order to make him cry , or to wake him from sleep . " " I ca n't hear this , Margaret . " " You can . I have done it , lived with it . You can hear it . " She seemed strong to him . He was wasting away , filed to nothingby grief , and she was strong , stronger . Talking about it asp238though it were a case history , an operation , some surgery that had been performed on her that she had survived and she was describingit to him . " You are disgusting . You are are are are monstrous . You did it because you are monstrous . " " I did it because I could , Valerian , and I stopped doing it or wanting to do it when I could n't . " " Could n't ? " " Yes , could n't . When he was too big , when he could do it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave me . " " He 's fine , I 'm telling you . He 's all right . " " Please leave me . " She understood , understood completely , and without another word she unlocked the door and left . Another time she waited for him at the breakfast table and said , " You are angry because he did n't tell you . " " Why did n't he tell me ? " Valerian had not thought of that yet ; he had been living with just the picture of the boy under the sink and had only been hearing the la la la , la la la , but now he realized that was part of his anger . " Why did n't he tell me ? " " He was probably too ashamed . " " Oh , God . " " I think he is still ashamed . " Valerian 's hands were shuddering again . " Why does he love you ? " he asked her over his shuddering fingers . " Why does he love you ? " " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a third time , " Why does he love you ? " " He knows I love him , " she said , " that I could n't help it . " Valerian shouted then , at the top of his throat , " Why does he love you ? " Margaret closed her blue-if-it's-a-boy blue eyes . " I do n't know . " Now the tears came . Not all at once . Not in the rush of bloodp239he anticipated , longed for ; rather a twilight glimmer , a little mercury in the eyes that grew brighter and brighter . That was the beginning and he knew there would be more of them . For now he would settle for this bright burning . Margaret opened her eyes and looked into his . " Hit me , " she said softly . " Hit me , Valerian . " His shuddering fingers went wild at the thought of touching her , making physical contact with that skin . His whole body recoiled . " No , " he said . " No . " " Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please , you have to . " Now he could see the lines , the ones the make-up had shielded brilliantly . A thread here and there and the roots of her hair were markedly different from the rest . She looked real . Not like a piece of Valerian candy , but like a person on a bus , already formed , fleshed , thick with a life which is not yours and not accessible to you . " Tomorrow , " he said . " Perhaps tomorrow . " Every day she asked him , every day he answered , " Tomorrow , perhaps tomorrow . " But he never did and she was hard-pressed to think of a way to ease their mutual sorrow . ON THE FIRST DAY of the year , Margaret pushed open the kitchen door . Ondine was there as she always was ; the braids Margaret had snatched were folded quietly now across her head . Margaret , having had the dream she ought to , felt clean , weightlessas she walked through the doors and stood at the oak table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chair , her feet resting on another . When she heard the grunt of the door hinges , she woke at once and stood up , alert . " No , no . Sit back down , Ondine . " Ondine shoved her feet into her moccasins and continued to stand . " Can I get you something ? " she asked out of habit andp240out of a need to do what was wanted of her and get the woman out of the kitchen . " No . No , thank you . " Margaret sat down and did not seem disturbed by the painful silence Ondine was keeping after the refusal . She looked past the black woman 's silhouette to a place in the shutters where the sky showed through . " I knew you knew , " she said . " I always knew you knew . " Ondine sat down without answering . " You loved my son , did n't you ? " It was more a statement than a question . " I love anything small that needs it , " said Ondine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying anything , but I have to tell you that it would have been better , Ondine , if you had . It 's terrible living in the same house with your own witness . But I think I understand it . You wanted me to hate you , did n't you ? That 's why you never said anything all those years . You wanted me to hate you . " " No , I did n't . You . . . you was n't a whole lot on my mind . " " Oh , yes I was , and you felt good hating me , did n't you ? I could be the mean white lady and you could be the good colored one . Did that make it easier for you ? " Ondine did not answer . " Anyway , I came in here to tell you that I 'm sorry . " Ondine sighed . " Me too . " " We could have been friends , Ondine . Like at first when I used to come in your kitchen and eat your food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ondine ? Did n't we use to laugh and laugh . Did n't we ? I have it right , do n't I ? " " You got it right . " " But you wanted to hate me , so you did n't tell . " " There was nobody to tell . It was woman stuff . I could n't tell your husband and I could n't tell mine . " " Why did n't you tell me ? I mean why did n't you scream atme , stop me , something . You knew and you never said a word . " " I guess I thought you would let us go . If I told Sydney hep241might tell Mr. Street and then we 'd be out of a job  --  a good job . I do n't know now what I thought , to tell the truth . But once I started keeping it  --  then it was like my secret too . Sometimes I thought if you all let me go there wo n't be anyone around to take the edge off it . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You should have stopped me . " " You should have stopped yourself . " " I did . I did stop myself after a while , but you could have stopped me right away , Ondine . " Ondine put the heels of her hands on her eyelids . When she removed them , her eyes were red . She blew out a breath and she was old . " Is that my job too ? To stop you ? " " No . It 's not your job , Ondine . But I wish it had been your duty . I wish you had liked me enough to help me . I was only nineteen . You were  --  what  --  thirty ? Thirty-five ? " Ondine tilted her head and looked at her employer sideways . She raised her eyebrows slowly and then squinted . It was as though she saw Margaret for the first time . She shook her head back and forth back and forth in wonder . " No , " she said . " I was n't thirty-five . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret put her forehead into her palm . The roots of her sunsethair were brown . She held her head that way for a moment and said , " You have to forgive me for that , Ondine . You have to . " " You forgive you . Do n't ask for more . " " You know what , Ondine ? You know what ? I want to be a wonderful , wonderful old lady . " Margaret laughed a rusty little bark that came from a place seldom used . " Ondine ? Let 's be wonderful old ladies . You and me . " " Huh , " said Ondine , but she smiled a little . " We 're both childless now , Ondine . And we 're both stuck here . We should be friends . It 's not too late . " Ondine looked out of the window and did not answer . " Is it too late , Ondine ? " " Almost , " she said . " Almost . "  |p242AT  SOME POINT in life the world 's beauty becomes enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even remember it . It is enough . No record of it needs to be kept and you do n't need someone to share it with or tell it to . When that happens  --  that letting go  --  you let go because you can . The world will always be there  --  while you sleep it will be there  --  when you wake it will be there as well . So you can sleep and there is reason to wake . A dead hydrangea is as intricate and lovely as one in bloom . Bleak sky is as seductive as sunshine , miniature orange trees without blossom or fruit are not defective ; they are that . So the windows of the greenhouse can be opened and the weather let in . The latch on the door can be left unhooked , the muslin removed , for the soldier ants are beautiful too and whatever they do will be part of it . Valerian began going back to his greenhouse . Not as early as before ; now he waited until after the breakfast rain . He was still telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not change anything in there . Did n't sow or clip or transpose . Things grew or died where and how they pleased . Isle des Chevaliersfilled in the spaces that had been the island 's to begin with . He thought about innocence there in his greenhouse and knew that he was guilty of it because he had lived with a woman who had made something kneel down in him the first time he saw her , but about whom he knew nothing ; had watched his son grow and talk but also about whom he had known nothing . And there was something so foul in that , something in the crime of innocence so revolting it paralyzed him . He had not known because he had not taken the trouble to know . He was satisfied with what he did know . Knowing more was inconvenient and frightening . Like a bucket of water with no bottom . If you know how to tread , bottomlessness need not concern you . Margaret knew the bottomlessness  --  she had looked at it , dived in it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful thing she had done . And how much more awful not to have known it . Which was all he could say in his defense : that hep243did not know ; that the postman passed him by . Perhaps that was why he had never received the message he 'd been waiting for : his innocence made him unworthy of it . The instinct of kings was always to slay the messenger , and they were right . A real messenger , a worthy one , is corrupted by the message he brings . And if he is noble he should accept that corruption . Valerian had received no message , but after waiting so long , to receive , know and deliver its contents , imperceptibly he had made it up . Made up the information he was waiting for . Preoccupiedhimself with the construction of the world and its inhabitantsaccording to this imagined message . But had chosen not to know the real message that his son had mailed to him from underneath the sink . And all he could say was that he did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there anything so loathsome as a willfully innocent man ? Hardly . An innocent man is a sin before God . Inhuman and therefore unworthy . No man should live without absorbing the sins of his kind , the foul air of his innocence , even if it did wilt rows of angel trumpets and cause them to fall from their vines.  | " THIS IS a town ? " Jadine shouted . " It looks like a block . A city block . In Queens . " " Hush up , " he said squeezing her waist . " This is not only a town , it 's the county seat . We call it the city . " " This is Eloe ? " " No . This is Poncie . Eloe is a little town . We got fourteen miles to go yet . " Now she understood why he wanted to rent a car and drive to Florida . There was no way to fly to Floe . They had to go to Tallahassee or Pensacola , then get a bus or train to Poncie , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and as for taxis  --  well , he doubted if either one would take them . Bumming a ride did n't seem to be a problem in his mind . Her luggage held all he had and when they got off the bus she saw eight or ten black men lounging there in front of the depot , as Son called it . Son talked to one of them for at least five minutes . They waited another thirty minutes at the candy machine until a black man named Carl appeared driving a four-door Plymouth . He drove them to Eloe asking pointed questions all the way . Son said he was an army buddy of a man named Soldier  --  that they were out of Brewton on their way to Gainesville . Thought he 'd look in on old Soldier , he said . Carl said he knew of Soldier but had never met him . He had never seen a cashmere sweater with a cowl neckline , or Chacrel boots , and did n't know they could make jeans that tight or if they did who but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in them . So hep245looked in the rear-view mirror with disbelief . Nobody dressed like that in Brewton , Alabama , and he suspected they did n't in Montgomery either . He followed Son 's directions and dropped them off in front of a house Jadine supposed was in Eloe since Son paid the man and got out . " Where are the ninety houses ? I see four , " asked Jadine , looking around . " They 're here . " " Where ? " " Spread out . Folks do n't live all crunched up together in Moe . Come on , girl . " He picked up the luggage and , grinning like a groom , led her up the steps . A frame door was open to the still March morning . They both stood in front of a screen door through which they could see a man sitting at a table with his back to them . Son did n't knock or move , he simply looked at the back of the man 's head . Slowly the man turned his head and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Son opened the screen door and stepped in with Jadine just behind him . He did n't move closer to the man ; he just stopped and smiled . The man did not speak and did not smile ; he kept on staring . Then he raised his hands , clenching them into fists , and began to jump up and down on both feet , stamping the floor like a kid jumping rope . Son was laughing soundlessly . A woman ran in , but the man kept on jumping  --  pounding the floor . The woman looked at Son and Jadine with a little confused smile . The man jumped higher and faster . Son kept watching and laughing . The man was still jumping rope , but not smiling or laughing as Son was . Finally when the stamping shook a lamp to the table 's edge arid a window banged down , and the children were peering in the doorway , the man shouted at the top of his lungs Son ! Son ! Son ! to the beat of his crazy feet , and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . " It 's me , Soldier . It 's me . " Soldier wrenched away , looked him in the face , then ran to the back window . " Wahoo ! Wahoo ! " he shouted , and came **30;8533;TOOLONG in the office doorway , watching their mother work . As the Americans left , the consul 's wife shooed them away and back to the screen . The twenty-four dollars stayed where it was , on the desk . When they returned to the central square and their car , Holliwell and his company found the boys gone but their hubcaps in place . Zecca opened the hood to see that the battery had not been stolen . All was well . On their way back to the Pan-American Highway , a little boy of hardly more than six ran toward the car , demanding to guide them . Zecca avoided running over him with some difficulty . " Well , that 's Zalteca , folks , " Zecca said . " Not such a bad town really , " Marie said . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 're in Tecan , " Zecca said , " you 'll think about it fondly . " They stopped at a filling station on the edge of town , filled the tank with the highest-grade gasoline and drank Coca-Colas . South of Zalteca the land flattened out altogether ; the line of the coast range disappeared and only fulsome clouds marked the proximityof the ocean . It was desert , the barest of cattle land , brown grass , dust . East of them the Sierra petered out into a low regular slope that seemed to be covered with a jungle of thorns . Within half an hour they were in sight of what appeared to be the border , a cluster of kiosks of different colors , a line of trucks , and most incongruously in this empty landscape , lines of people blocking the road . The border between Compostela and Tecan proved to be an affair of some social complexity . The Compostelan dimension consisted of three adjoining green buildings atop one of which the national banner hung lifeless from a peeling flagpole . The highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumps were green-striped on the Compostelan side ; on the Tecan side the stripes were yellow . Four Compostelan border policemen in green tropicals and Wehrmachtstylecaps lounged together in the shade of the customs shed , a fifth was making what appeared to be a halfhearted inspection of a truck loaded with kerosene stoves . From the perfunctory nature of his pokingand prodding about the truck , he appeared not to have had his turn at AID customs school.  |p151The  real action was all on the Tecanecan side . There , six or so trucks were lined up at the side of the road while Tecanecan customs men in coveralls went over them with screw drivers and flashlights . The difference in ambiance on the far side of the border was reinforcedby the presence there of the Tecanecan Guardia Nacional , whose uniforms , resembling those of American paratroopers completewith the laced boots and colored scarves , were freshly pressed and spotless and quite different from those of the ordinary customs inspectors . The Guardia were occupying themselves with a long line of young foreigners who had been lined up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagpacks and who stood , facing Compostela , squinting into the sun and looking frightened and unhappy . Zecca had parked his car so that its front tires surmounted the first Tecanecan speed bump ; those foremost in the line of colorful young travelers could exchange glances with the passengers in the Honda at a distance of a few feet . " It 's hard to get into Tecan if they think you look funny , " Zecca said . " It 's even harder to get out . " There was a sergeant in charge of the line of funny-looking foreigners . The sergeant was black , although it was not a part of Tecan where many black people lived  --  the Guardia Nacional pursued the tradition of stationing the members of the gendarmerie as far as possible from their native region . This made assignments fairly predictablein Tecan ; it was not a large country and its only regions were the mountains and the land on either side of them . The sergeant was repeatedly inspecting and commenting upon the hippie gringos . From time to time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull him out of line , caress the hair while making kissing noises with his mouth , shout something at the youth and shove him back in line . He had a repertory of spits and sneers and snarls and his smiles were not good-humored . ' When he came to a girl who struck his fancy , he would pause contemplatively and feel her up . No one seemed to be protesting his behavior . " Shit , " Zecca said , " they must have caught someone with grass . " " I think someone should have a word with that guy , " Marie said . On the opposite side of the road , another event was in progress . A cow had fallen into the ditch that marked the frontier and entan/gled itself in the wire the Tecanecans strung on their side of the line . A crowd of local boys , whose proper business was assisting tourists through customs , selling cold drinks or begging , were amusing themselvesby stoning it to death . The cow had so totally engaged their attention that they ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was lying with its back legs tucked under it , its hooves tearing ineffectually at the dirt and wire while the rocks crashed down on it from every side . The boys would exhaust their handful and then run off into the sandy fields to gather more . Each stone was received by the cow with a soft bellow . Its eyes and nostrils were beginning to show blood . " Look at that , for Christ 's sake , " Marie said . " Are we going to do something about this bullshit ? " she asked her husband . " Hang on , " he told her . " Everybody give me their passport . " The Honda 's passengers gave him their passports ; he climbed out from behind the wheel and held a brief dialogue with the officials on the Compostelan side . Holliwell and Bob Cole sat watching the boys stone the cow . As they watched , one of the smaller boys looked over at the car , wiped his hands and approached them with a glass jar . He thrust the jar through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest scorpion Holliwell had ever seen . " Two dollar , " the boy said . " No , " Holliwell said . " No , gracias . " For a moment he thought he might be being threatened . If he failed to produce two dollars the boy would drop it on his chest . " One dollar , " the boy said . Marie Zecca let out a fetching little scream . " No , " Holliwell said . " Otra vez . " But the boy only made a farting noise at them and ran back to throw more rocks at the cow . " That thing must have been nine inches long , " Marie Zecca said . " Smaller than that , surely , " Bob Cole told her . Tom Zecca came back clutching the brace of passports . " What happened ? " " A kid just tried to sell me a scorpion , " Holliwell said . " Hell , you ca n't give them away around here . This is aiacran city . "  | " I suppose , " Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marie Zecca grasped the back seat and turned to Tom . " Look , man  --  those nasty little kids are murdering a defenseless animal and over there that goddamn Guardia is abusing women and children . Can we do something about this action ? " " Sure , " Zecca said . He handed the passports back round and started up the car , easing it over the Tecanecan speed trap . This forcing of his nation 's border attracted the Guardia sergeant 's attention ; he came toward them with languid belligerence , walking with his hands on his hips . " Buenas tardes , sargente , " Tom Zecca hastened to say , when the Guardia stood beside his window . He thrust the red passport into the sergeant 's hand . The Guardia looked at it through the reflecting sunglasses that were as much a part of the Guardia uniform as the paratroop boots . Within a moment of inspecting the passport , the sergeant drew himself to attention and saluted energetically . " Senor Capitano , bienvenidos a su casa . " Zecca thanked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the cow ? " Marie whispered . From where they were now parked , Holliwell was looking out nearly eye level with the young Europeans and North Americans who were trying to cross the border . A number of them , boys and girls both , had begun to cry . " Sergeant , " Tom Zecca said , " I 'm sure you know how women are . My wife here is disturbed by the misfortune of that cow . Can something be done ? " His Spanish was effortless , unashamedly Americanin accent . " Capitano , " said the Guardia , smiling with Zecca , " claro que si . " He walked over toward the ditch , drawing the automatic pistol from the web belt at his waist as he went . Bracing his legs , he fired the weapon three times , a few inches above the hairline of the tallest boy . The gringo youths in line recoiled at the firing . The boys dropped their stones and scattered crouching , diving for cover . Some cringed along the shoulder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands clasped over their heads . The cow was so startled at the burst of fire that it freed itself from the wire in an awkward lunge , gained its feet and succeeded in haul/ing itself out of the ditch . Liberated , it trotted up to the Pan-AmericanHighway , eluded a charge by the cursing Compostelan customs cops with a bovine end run and took off down the center line , headed for the capital . Zecca waved his thanks . " Que le vaya bien , capitano , " the sergeant called , and returned to the line of quaking travelers . The Honda and its passengers drove past their wistful glances . " It 's lousy about these kids , " Zecca said . " But I ca n't interfere in that . " " They ca n't all be carrying dope , " Holliwell said . " No , he just got one or two . He 'll let the rest out when he 's had his fun . " " They really are pigs , the Guardia , " Marie said . " Actual pigs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Bob Cole asked . " Best not to think about it , " Zecca said . " It was very dumb ofthem to buy it here . They were probably turned by the guy whosold it . " " I did n't know you were a captain , " Holliwell said after a while . " That 's because I did n't tell you . But I am . U.S. Army . I 'm with the military mission in San Ysidro . " Bob Cole stared at him . " Do n't you feel a little . . . " Cole let the question die . " A little what , Mr. Cole ? I feel just fine . " " O.K. , " Cole said . He turned to Holliwell . " Can you imagine what that feels like  --  especially for a college kid ? Standing there , taking that abuse , waiting for those bastards to go through your stuff ? " " I know what it feels like , " Holliwell said . " I dream about it . " " That was no dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that was an average day at the gates of Tecan . " As they drove south , the wind carried dust clouds that sometimes forced them to close the car windows . With every kilometer the land seemed more brown and infertile , the cattle fewer , the corn scantier and more stunted . A squat brown volcano came into view in the southwest ; the wind whipped its faint smoke trails into the lowering sky.  | " I 'll tell you a Guardia story , " Tom Zecca said . " Our Caudillo in the capital lives in a house with a hundred and fifty rooms . The grounds take up about twenty-five city blocks square and there 's a wall of cactus against the fence . The whole complex is patrolled by German shepherds , real ones  --  from Germany . When the old man bought them he was told that they had to have steak every night to be happy and alert  --  so the palace is serving up steak dinners for over a hundred of these huge mutts . The dogs probably eat more meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Caudillo arrives at his desk to find eight guys from the palace Guardia detachment on their knees in front of it . The palace commandant is his little brother Arturo and Arturo is wailing on these guys , yelling and carrying on and beating on them with the butt of his sidearm . It turns out they 've been stealing the dogs ' steak , sneaking it home to their families . Arturo 's beside himself , making points with big brother . A breach of the President 's trust . Treason to the nation . A disgrace to the most honored branch of the service . And so on . One of the Guardia is already half dead from Arturo 's beating on him . " Now this is a thorny problem . These characters know all the security arrangements for the presidential palace . They know where all the bodies are buried  --  we 're in Tecan now , so I 'm speaking literally . You ca n't fire these men , you 've got to shoot them or forget about it . " Amid the weeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponders deeply . Finally he tells Arturo to knock off and let them go . From now on he says , all the Guardia and their families get steak every night just like the dogs . AID will pay for it somehow . The Guardia crawl over to El Hombre , they cry on his cuffs , they lick his boots . He 's got their loyalty for life . They 'll all walk over their grandmothersfor him . " All except the dude little brother 's been beating on too much . He 's too punchy to be properly grateful , so they shoot him . " Marie uttered a soft vibrating wail , indicating fear and loathing . " Life in Tecan , " she said . " But observe the craft , " Tom said . " Observe the crude but sound statesmanship . The bastard has n't been in power all this time for nothing . "  | " Have you been inside that palace ? " Holliwell asked Tom . " Claro . Many times . Even partied there . " " The parties , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dracula movie but without the class . " " The last party I went to , " Tom said , " was after I 'd been out to the islands , so I 'd been peeling . I mean my skin was peeling from sunburn . Up to me comes Arturo-drunk out of his gourd , as is customary . He grabs a fistful of skin off my nose and calls me a gringo . " " You did n't tell me about that , " Marie said . " What did you do ? " " What did I do ? smiled and saluted . Is Arturo a sadistic little creep ? Should I have cold-cocked him and rubbed him into the carpet ? Claro . But I represent the flag , comprende ? In my small way , I represent Policy . I had my dress whites on and two years in grade . " " He 'll get his , " Marie said . " Not if we can help it , my dear . If we can help it , he 'll be the next President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Holliwell said . " Someone acceptable . " " Well , Arturo 's a stopgap . While Policy decides what to do next . Mind you , Fat Frank really likes the guy . He likes the whole family . He thinks they 're American-type people . " " That 's a quote , " Marie said . " American-type people . ' Because they - speak English to him . " " Fat Frank ? " Holliwell asked . " Ambassador Bridges . Some people call him that . " " But not us , " Tom said . Bob Cole was staring out at the hills to their left . The desert ended where they rose toward the Sierra and the further hills showed dark green . " That 's coffee up there , " he said after a while . Holliwell thought that Zecca was glad to hear him speak . Cole 's silence had been makinghim uneasy . " That 's right , " Tom told him . " Good grade and low price , they tell me . But what do I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress up there , " Cole said . " Given the situation . " " Yeah ? " Tom Zecca asked him coolly . " Why do you say that ? "  | " The way I understand it , " Cole said , " wherever you 've got coffee in this country , you 've got an insurgency . They go together . " " There 's a degree of truth in that , " Tom said . " Is there one going on up there ? " " What do you hear ? " Zecca asked him . " I hear there is . That it 's centered around Extremadura . Among the Indians there . " " Who says that ? " Cole looked on Captain Zecca with a sagging smile , his mossy yellow teeth briefly displayed . " There was a piece in the international edition of the Miami Herald last week . It was off the AP wire  --  I think the dateline was San Jose . You must have seen it . " " I saw it , " Zecca said . " Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole said , turning his gaze back toward the hills , " I 'm thinking of going up there . " " I would n't , " Zecca said . " You ought n't to , " Marie told Cole . " I 've been around there . If I were you I would n't go up there right now . " " I 'm just doing my job . Like you folks are . Like Mr. I-Iolliwell . " What job ? Holliwell thought . What does he mean ? " If I know you 're up there , " Zecca said , " I 'm going to worry about you . The Atapas do n't like strangers around in the best of times and they 're not nearly as tranquil as they look . Especially these days . " " Do you suggest I register my presence with the embassy in San Ysidro ? " " Honest to God , Mr. Cole , " Zecca said , " I do n't know what to suggest . Except that you not go . " " I understand , " Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau . The coastward volcano was abreast of them , a second , larger rose ahead . To Holliwell , they seemed freakish mountains ; only malignant gods could inhabit or inform them . They rose solitary out of featureless tableland , bare , without harmony , unbeautiful enough to appear exactly what they were  --  burst excrescences on Tecan 's pocked dusty hide . A geology lesson , he thought . They communicated a troubling sense of the earth as nothing more than itself , of blind force and mortality . Asp158mindlessly refuting of hope as a skull and bones . The landscape was a memento mori , the view ahead like a dead ocean floor . " Scary , " Holliwell said . Tom and Marie laughed . " We thought it was only us , " Marie said . " The Tecanecans are very big on their volcanoes , " Tom told Holliwell . " They 're on the flag and the national seal . They run up and down the country along a fault . First thing a local will ask you when you come in-country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Key-to-the-country kind of thing ? " " I never had it put that elaborately , " Tom said . " I do n't think anyone here thinks they 're the key to the country . They 're just big things for turistas to gawp at . I mean they 're there and they 're huge and uniquely Tecanecan , so the Tecs are proud of them . It 's their duty to be . " " What does the national poet say ? Is he on about them ? " " They do n't have a national poet to speak of . They never had a Ruben Dario in Tecan . Never saw the need of one . " " There 's a verse about the volcanoes in the national anthem though , " Marie said . " I ca n't remember how it goes . It 's pretty trite . " " The first movement of Brahms ' First , " Tom told them . " That 's the national anthem . Moving as hell . In the old days before the Marines came the Tecanecan Army could goose-step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They began to pass more buses on the road . The number of dirt roads with signs indicating villages off the road increased . Tom slowed down , wary of children and cattle on the highway , sounding his horn at turns to warn the burro carts that appeared more and more often now as they approached the capital . From time to time , they passed a lone Indian bent under a load of firewood . People looked down at the dirt as the car sped by them . " What I wonder , " Bob Cole said in his strange tremulous voice , " is whether the people down here have to live this way so that we can live the way we do . " " I 'm just a soldier , " Zecca said . " But I think the answer to that is no . It sounds too simple to me . " " But it 's not a simple question , " Marie said brightly . " It 's a really complicated one . " Cole turned to Holliwell.  | " How about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think the answer is ? " " I have to confess , " Holliwell said , " that I have n't figured that out . There are lots of gaps in my expertise . I do n't know what the answer is . " " We have to believe it 's no , do n't we ? " Cole asked . " We could n't face up to it otherwise . Because if most of the world lives in this kind of poverty so that we can have our goodies and our extra protein ration  --  what does that make us ? " " It makes us vampires , " Holliwell said . " It makes us all the cartoon figures in the Communist press . " " What if you found out it were true ? " " Me ? What I do does n't matter . I 'd go on doing what I 'm doing . " " How about you , Captain ? " Zecca took one hand from the wheel and turned partway around toward Cole . Marie kept her eyes on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Zecca asked . " Some kind of an agitator ? " He asked the question humorously , with more of Toledoin his voice than he usually permitted . " Not at all , " Cole said . At the approaches to the Tecanecan capital of San Ysidro , the Pan-American Highway wound down in switchbacks from the high desert into a lush tropical plain beside a great lake . As they started the descent , the sun hung over the low hills of the coffee country and the contours of the two visible volcanoes softened to show Holliwella more insidious menace . They were running late . After sundown , the inter-capital truck traffic would be on the road  --  a mortal risk . " When you were in Vietnam , " Holliwell asked Cole , " what did you do there ? " In the expectant silence that filled the car , Cole seemed to force an answer . " I was in the Army , " he told them . " In the Army there for three years because I extended . " " Is that right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon , a second lieutenant . Then I was on staff , with intelligence . Then later . . . I went back . With AID . And then I went back again as press , free-lancing . " " You must have liked it there , " Zecca said.  | " In a way , " Cole said , " I liked it very much . " The captain smiled thinly . " It held a fascination for you . A kind of moral fascination , am I right ? " " Well ... " Cole began . " Yes , " he said . " I can understand that very well . Right , Marie ? " " Sure , " Marie said . " A lot of our friends were like that . We were a little like that too , were n't we ? " " We sure were , " Tom said . " And we were courting , so that lent color to our moral fascination . " " I never found time to go courting , " Cole told him . " Too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get laid ? Or were n't you interested ? " " Sexist talk , " Marie hissed softly . " Jeez . " Holliwell asked Cole if he had been much in the delta . He hadbeen . He had been out to the island and met the coconut monk . " He 's in jail now , that guy , " Tom said . " They locked him up . " " That 's a mistake if it 's true , " Cole said . " It 's true , " Holliwell found himself saying . " And they did n't lock him up by mistake . They know what they 're doing . " " Fucking-A , " Zecca said . Cole only shrugged and looked more unhappy . Fields of bananas grew on the slopes above San Ysidro , introducedthere from the east coast . The town below was a white seaport city with the lake doing duty as ocean . It was a lake twice the size of the Lago Azul but lifeless from four hundred years of ill use . Its surface was still and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove past a summerhouse among the young banana trees , a pocket villa hung with Japanese lanterns . Below them , a mile or so from the foamy edge of the lake , was a reservoir , surrounded by a cement wall . " The Marines put that in during the nineteen thirties , " Zecca told them . " You can drink the water here . Only drinkable water between El Paso and God knows where . " " That at least , " Marie said . " So our presence here has n't been all bad news . " Cole stirred in his seat , his thoughts apparently fixed on the coffee country . Holliwell lit a cigarette . Entering the capital , the Pan-American Highway made a briefp161promenade into town , running along the lakefront past several blocks of crumbling , incongruously Victorian mansions and lit by cast-iron streetlamps of antique Parisian design . After less than half a mile of this , it broke up into unpaved narrow streets . San Ysidro , in its tuck of the lake valley , was losing the light . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted , but alive with the din of a half-seen crowd . Driving slowly , Zecca put his head out of the car window to see past the screen of dust and crushed insects that fouled his windshield . On corners , vendors sold roasted maize from pushcarts , barefoot families made their way along the damp walls , ready to press back against them as cars passed . At the intersection where there was a little light , groups of young men in bright plastic shirts stood together drinking rum , listening or singing to someone 's guitar . There was much music to be heard  --  but these streets were not festive or lyrical . The mood was restless  --  febrile , Holliwell thought  --  furtive . The songs were short on melody , driven and mocking , calling forth from those who listened a hard humorless laughter . Holliwell could not understand a word of the shouted , perversely inflected Tecanecan Spanish that went back and forth in the darkening streets as they passed . He and Cole were tense and silent . " Late at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Holliwell caught a whiff of marijuana on the air , something he had never experienced before in a public place in a Spanish-American city . From a nearby street , he heard what seemed to be screaming . " Pretty lively for this time of evening , " he said . Zecca pulled his head back in and steered carefully round a turn . " It 's always lively on this side of town . It 's one big bad party . " Someone fired a water gun at Cole 's closed window . Cole lookedat the dirty water streaking down the glass beside him . " Hey , Cole , " Zecca said , " a lot of the people here are from Extremadura . You could find out a lot by checking it out over here , discreetly . In the daytime . " " I think I 'd do better out there , do n't you ? I mean , I 'd feel kind of heavy-footed around here . I 'd be drawing crowds . " " You 're gon na draw crowds anywhere , " Zecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the country or of Cole . Holliwell began to notice that there were a surprising number ofp162cars in the narrow streets , most of them American cars only a few years old . They drove along a block of open arcaded shops and came on a cathedral square centered on a monumental obelisk . The rotary around it ran its course like a mechanized feeding frenzy , a riot of oversized cars in every condition , bad driving and ostrich optimism . " Well , shit , " Zecca said , and drove the Honda into it . Marie clung to the back of her seat , her face on her arm . Cole and Holliwell held to the top of the car interior . They went halfway around the rotary and up a wide , park-sided avenue that ran between the cathedral square and another plaza , visible in the distance , where there were neon signs and taller buildings  --  office buildings lit on every story . To one side of the avenue along which they drove was a forest of low trees , divided from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side there was more greenery . There , only the tops of trees were visible because the thick wire fence along the street was backed with a wall of cactus . " On your right here , " Tom Zecca said , " behind the wire and the cactus and the German shepherds is the palace of the President . Over there is the Central Park and the Zoo , famous for its three-legged cow . " There are about ten thousand people bedding down in that park now . They 're a lot worse off than the people back there in Mamalago . But the nearest shack is more than a mortar 's distance away from the Palace . That 's a trick we taught the President . Anything closer is patrolled by the Guardia . The cracks in that obelisk back there came from the earthquake ten years ago . The people in Mamalago moved into the park and some of them never moved back . Then more folks came down from the hills and took over the houses in Mamalago . If you 're in Mamalago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . Mamalagoand the park are better than the shanty towns on the west slope . If it were still light , you 'd have got a good look at the cathedral and you 'd have seen the Palace of Culture beside it . " " Where they have the midget wrestling , " Marie said . " What 's the obelisk for ? " Cole asked . " Usual shit , " Zecca said . " Victory and independence and successfulstruggle . Tecan always wins . It won the Second World War . " It was a dead-hot city , sea level and without hope or promise ofp163an ocean breeze . As they drove along the ceremonial avenue , the day 's heat welled up from the earth ; the mixed smell of the jungle plants and of cheap gasoline threatened to close off breath . As they passed the palace gatehouse the smells , the sight of the sentry box in its well of light under the jacaranda , the brown sawedoffsoldiers in MP 's helmets brought Holliwell such a Vietnam flash that he was certain that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent a mixture of nostalgia and dread that in spite of the morning booze-up which was still fouling his blood , he began to feel like a drink . No one said a thing . When they made the turn into traffic at the end of the drive he half expected to see noodle restaurants beside the cinema with its cheap imported karate thriller  --  but there were record shops and farmacias instead and the street vendors sold roasted nuts and empanadas and the city smell was of cigars and pomade and dust instead of fish sauce and incense and bougainvillea . Some things were the same though . The empty stares , the dementedtraffic  --  even the newly built bus station had about it something of the curving hand-me-down art deco of downtown Saigon . There were beggars clustered about its doors with little paper cartonsfull of cigarettes or chewing gum and fruit or sometimes only brown outstretched open palms . And the markets would be behind the bus station , where they always were , in Tecan as in Danang or Hue . " As close to the bus station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will suit me fine . " " You 're not trying for Extremadura tonight ? " Marie protested . " You 'll get there in the wee hours . You 'll have no place to sleep . " " My little red book says there 's a through bus in two hours , " Cole told her . " I 'll wander around town a little and get it . " When they pulled up at the bus station both Tom and Marie turned around to check that their car was out of traffic . " Stay the night with us , " Marie said . Tom , beside her , was nodding . " No , thanks , " Cole told them . " Look , " he said to Tom Zecca , " maybe someone from the consular office should know I 'm up there . If that 's the case , you tell them . O.K. ? "  | " You 're making a mistake , " Zecca said . " That 's the advice of the consular office . As conveyed by me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He climbed out of the car and started into the crowds in front of the bus station . The beggars were on him at once . " How do you like that ? " Marie said . " He 's out of his mind . " Carefully Zecca pulled the car into traffic again , and rounded the bus station block . " He broke up with his wife , " Tom said . " I think I remember him telling me that . " In the market behind the station the stalls were beginning to close . The streets at this end of the city were very like the streets at the lakeside with their mud roadways and high broken curbs . The same morose groups were gathered at corners . " Shit , the guy 's crazy , " Zecca said . " He 'll get macheted up there . it And he better not wander off from the bus station or he wo n't even get that far . This is no town for midnight strolls . " The Zeccas lived in a house high on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little stucco walls in front of them . At the end of their comfortable street , the shacks began , cut offII from the bourgeois fortress by a barricade of barbed wire , rusted road signs and sheet metal : as they drove the Honda into their garage and began unloading their gear , a chorus of unseen dogs set up a cry from one end of the street to the other . A smiling young maidservant met them at the door . She took asmany of their cases as she could manage and led them into the livingroom . The house was new but tasteful and pleasant in a severe colonial style . The tiles looked as though they might have come from Spain , the oak beams were weathered and supported at their moldings by metal studs . Oak beams were not just for fun in Tecan  --  the number and mortality of her earthquakes was appalling . It was a small house , by no means sumptuous , with a homely American smell . Marie argued the maid out of making them dinner and sent her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the maid 's room and her opportunity to watch the dubbed soap operas had made her the foremost storyteller in her barrio.  | " Well , we can go out or I can make us up something simple . Like ham and eggs . " " There 's a big production of a place , La Finca , a few blocks from here , " Tom Zecca said . " Steak in the local style . Muy Autentico . Lots of music and red bandanas flapping . " " Speaking just for me , " Holliwell said , " I 'm not very hungry . But I 'll go along with anything . " " Well , I 'm not too hungry myself , " Zecca said . " Do n't know why . " " Maybe no one 's hungry , " Marie said . " Looks like no one is , " Tom said . " But I think everyone would like a drink . " Holliwell nodded gratefully . They took margaritas in a small garden , closely bound by vinecoveredwalls and banana trees . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs that had been set around it . Marie put out glasses and two large blenders full of margaritas . " Someday , " she told Holliwell , pouring the drinks into the frosted glasses , " I 'll tell you about the day I was sitting out here and an iguana fell in my lap . " Tom took his drink . " And me  --  goddamn it  --  I missed it . I was at the office . I have to reconstruct the whole scene in my imagination . " " As I remember it , " Marie said , " the cops came . People poured into the street , crossing themselves . " They drank and after a moment Tom said : " What about that Cole guy ? Now there 's a questionable character . " It struck Holliwell as odd that Captain Zecca would raise the matter of Cole 's questionabilitywith him . He looked across the table and saw that Marie was shaking her head sadly . Perhaps they were just relaxing . " I suppose the question about Cole , " Holliwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thinks he 's doing . " " Do you mean does he think he 's Regis Debray ? " " No , " Holliwell said , " I mean beyond that . " " Beyond that ? " Zecca asked . " Beyond that is n't necessarily my business . Beyond that he 's a Vietnam burn-out . A pilgrim . " " There 's a lot of us , " Holliwell said . " You see yourself as a bum-out ? " Marie asked . She turned to her husband . " I would n't have described him that way . " " Maybe just badly seared , " Holliwell said.  | " Everyone that ever saw that Place is a little fucked u ) Tom said , leaning his stocking feet on the delicate table . It was easY to picture himat the Diplomat Hotel or some BOQ bar , a younger man , harder case , second-generation tough , hungry . " It was the dumbest damn thing we ever did as a country , no question about it . " " Well , we told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nobody listeneduntil it was too late . " " No , " Holliwell said , " we told them and they did n't listen . " " AID ? " Zecca asked . " That was your cover ? " Holliwell became afraid . It was a misunderstanding . " It was n't a cover , " he insisted . " I was n't an intelligence specialistor even a contract employee . I mean , you know how it is . " He was staring at his drink . The Zeccas watched him . " They come to you . Someone has a girlfriend in Saigon , he wants to stay there , so he has to make work for himself , he has to make up a report to file . So whatan anthropologist knows  --  family relationships , the relationship of an uncle to a nephew , a younger cousin to an older cousin  --  it all goes into the hopper . Nobody gives a shit about it  --  maybe nobody everlooks at it . But it ends up  --  pardon the expression  --  intelligence . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Did you learn the language ? " Tom asked him . " I picked up a certain residue . No , " he said . " I never really did . I depended on a few local people and we spoke mainly in French . " The thought came to Holliwell that he had spent much of his life depending on a few local people , speaking some lingua franca , hovering insect-like about the edge of some complex ancient society which he could never hope to really penetrate . That was his relation-1 with the world . And he himself  --  more and more losing touch with the family he had made , a bastard of no family origin , no blood or folk . A man from another planet forever inquiring of helpful strangers the nature of their bonds with one another . " I do n't know how I got into family structures , " he heard himself tell the Zeccas . Tequila . Insidious . " It was archaeology I liked . Theruins , the traces , you know . I would have liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe you will yet , " Marie said . " The family , " Holliwell said . " It 's so strange , you know . I never had a family of my own to speak of . And the one I 've raised I don'tp167believe I understand at all . As far as other people 's families go  --  I 'm absolutely ignorant . " " Christ , " Tom Zecca said . He was relaxed now , merry with the end of the drive . " With guys like you in the shop no wonder we lost the goddamn war in Nam . " They all laughed . " No , " Zecca said , touching his arm to reassure him . " I 'm kidding you , bro . You 're O.K. You 're a straight shooter . " " I hope our friend Cole comes down O.K. He worries me a little . " " How about it , Holliwell ? " Captain Zecca asked . " You think he 's a spook ? " " You 'd probably know more about that than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you something , Doc Holliwell . . . I do n't know much until I read my mail  --  that 's the situation we 've got working here . Maybe there 's a line on him in the pouch tomorrow . " And maybe , Holliwell thought , a line on me . " Well , " Marie said , " he 'll be up there tomorrow wandering about among all those disgruntled macheteros . Feel for him , guys . " " We do , " Holliwell said . " Poor useless bastard , " Zecca said , pouring out his creamy margarita . " He does n't know who he works for and he does n't know what side he 's on . Even if he 's ours , he 's not a hundred percent sure . You take a dude like that and the next thing you know you 've got a double agent , the most dangerous goddamn creature walking . " " They have short life spans , " Marie said , " that 's one thing about them . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the second blender into position . " But damnit , those people up there are screwed . They 're getting dumped on in the most incredible fashion . " " You better believe it , " the captain said . " For untold fucking generations they 've been living on beans and lizards to grow coffee for the bastards that run this country . Now we 've found copper up there and the idiot greedhead generals who own it are throwing them off the land  --  sending them down here to beg or starve . Nah , " Zeccap168said , " who am I to knock Cole ? It 's no wonder they 're fighting back . " " Are they ? " Holliwell asked him . " Are they seriously fighting back ? I wish I knew . I 'm supposed to . I ca n't depend on dip-shits like Cole . One of these days I 'm going to have to exercise my ass and go find out . I go up there in a chopper and they 've got the weaponry , I 'll know in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " Marie said . " If this place goes , they know where to find us . We 're fatalists . That 's what you 've got to be , see . You 've got to be a fatalist . " They drank from the second blender . " How much do you know for sure ? " Holliwell asked . " If you do n't mind telling me . " " O.K. , " Zecca said . " There 's a basic , quite justified piss-off all over the country . It 's particularly strong up in the Sierra where the Atapas live and the Atapas have a history of banditry and troublemaking . They can handle modern weapons but we do n't really know if they have any or if they have , what sort . If they 've got , say , groundto-airmissiles  --  El General is in big trouble . Likewise if they 've got a big cache of AKA 's . Here in town , anyone with a brain or an honest buck to turn hates the government but probably wo n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  they 're divided into factions , Fidelistas , Trots , Maoists  --  the usual spectrum . Over on the east coast people tell you time stands still , nobody expects trouble over there . In my opinion that 's complacent because if anybody lands armament it 'll be over there , not on the Pacific coast . And it 's hard to fly stuff in here because we gave them an outrageous air force and we trained them in radar detection . " " Sounds sort of standard , " Holliwell said . " It 's not , though . Because now the morons who run this joint have given every anti-government faction a common cause with that copper grab . The unemployment rate is like sixty percent here . The streets are full of teen-age kids with nothing to do but rip off whatever'shandy and go to the karate movies . You could make a tough little army out of those kids . Inept , disorganized , sure . But you 'd have to kill whole bunches of them  --  they 'd be the cannon fodder . El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Bad scene , " Zecca said . " The question is  --  does the Guardia stay loyal ? Answer  --  probably . "  | " And when the Guardia goes in  --  we advise them ? " " Mr. Holliwell , " Zecca said . " Doctor ! We put this government in for our own interests . We trained the Guardia . Our ambassador thinks the Pres and his family are American-type people . " " There 's a grain of truth in that , " Marie Zecca said . " You 're a Communist , " Captain Zecca told his wife . " She sings Guantanamera ' at embassy lawn parties . " " Under my breath , " Marie said . " Fat Frank would n't recognize it if he heard it anyway . " " O.K. , " Zecca said . " the Guardia will have American weapons and support . The support will be mealy-mouthed and covert but it will be there . " " And what do honest folk like ourselves do then , Captain Zecca ? " Holliwell inquired . Zecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's too late , understand . The usual shit will go down . You and I , Doc , maybe we know something about the country . But it 's too late . If we do n't back them now , we 'll have a Russian submarine base in Puerto Alvarado  --  maybe a missile base this time . See how that goes over in Dubuque , in Congress , in the White House , for Christ 's sake . " " Fucked again , " Holliwell said . " I 'll be gone , " Zecca said . " My tour is almost up . Then they can send in the types who like the Guardia 's style . The headhunters , the Cubans , the counterinsurgency LURPS 's . And the guys who enjoy saluting animals in tailor-made pink uniforms . " " And where will you be then ? " " I do n't know , " Zecca said . " Not some place like this . They owe me . " It 's not all one thing or another , you know , " Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . Only assholes think that . Pious assholes . " " Do n't call him a pious asshole , " Captain Zecca commanded his wife . " I do n't mean him , " Marie said , and Holliwell thought she was beginning to cry . " I do n't mean you , " she assured him . " I agree with you . I do n't even mean Cole and Cole really is a pious asshole . " " You have to go on hoping for the best , " Zecca said.  |p170Marie  nodded . " You have to have faith . " " Only pious assholes have faith , Marie , " the captain said . " Up yours , " Marie told him . Holliwell drank another margarita . It was all in fun . " Let me tell you something , " the captain said suddenly to Holliwell . " In Nam I spent two years in combat intelligence . In that time I interrogated maybe hundreds of prisoners and chieu hois and I never once let the Arvins get away with torturing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never did , in any of the time I was in that place , anything I thought was cruel or dishonorable . You believe me ? " " Of course , " Holliwell said . " I never sat still for shooting up civilians , not even up north . I never clipped an ear or set fire to a hootch and I never countenanced it . I conducted that fucking war honorably and so did my people . I did that to the greatest possible extent , sir , and it was n't easy in my position . Moreover , I thought it was a crock , a stupid hopeless crock . It was dumb and it was inhuman by its nature . But me , " Zecca said , turning his fingertips inward and tapping his heart , " I 'm not . I make that claim . " " It 's true , " Marie said . " I do n't claim virtue , " Zecca declared . " I do n't claim to be a kindly man . I claim to be capable of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I took an oath , " Zecca said . " I fulfilled it and I fucking fulfilled it without compromising myself . Takes a little working at . " " Surely , " Holliwell said . " The Army did n't send me down here to be a chaplain to the peasantry or to feed the birds or conduct an agrarian reform . It sent me down because I 'm supposed to know about the lay of the country from a military point of view . In terms of intercontinental defense . " " Of course , " Holliwell said , " intercontinental defense . And you 're beginning to feel compromised ? " " No , " Zecca said quickly . " Not at this point . " " Excuse me , " Holliwell said . " Do you expect to conduct your career in one American-sponsored shithole after another , partying with their ruling class , advising their conscripts in counterinsurgency and overseeing their armaments , and not compromise your oath or your honor ? Because that sounds very tricky to me. "  | " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I know a few , " Holliwell said . " Beyond that I know what you tell me . " " I know what you know , " Zecca said . Holliwell folded his hands on the metal table . In the circumstances , he had gone too far . " And this is what I tell you  --  that when they evict those people over the mineral rights , I hope to Christ we 'll be on our way to another posting . O.K.  --  that 's a cop-out , it 's a quease . But you 've got to think in terms of the larger scale , the ... " " The Big Picture . " " The Big Picture , " Zecca said with a grim smile . " Thank you , sir . But you do n't know what 's really going on here . Neither does Cole . He thinks he does but he does n't . He knows more than me but I know more than him , do you follow me ? " " I think we went to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I both went to St. Bonaventure , " Marie told him . " In Olean , New York . " Captain Zecca was drunk . So was Marie . So , to his own reckless satisfaction , was Holliwell . " I 'm sorry , " Holliwell declared . " I do n't approve of the American presence here . " " Someday , " Captain Zecca said , " I 'm going to work with the Chinese . Someday somewhere the conditions are gon na be right and me and the Chinese will get something going  --  I do n't care if it 's Africa  --  maybe even China . " " Would n't that be great , " Marie said . " I 'm a fucking master of destiny , " Zecca said . " My family is related to Napoleon 's . I 'm gon na get down with those Chinese . " " Listen to him , " Marie said . " I hope you realize we 're all drunk here . " " I realize it , " Holliwell said . " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , " Marie went on a little sadly , " I wish we could trust you . I mean , we do n't even know who you are and here we 're talking about the Chinese . " " You know who I am and you can trust me , " Holliwell said . " Personally , I enjoy talking about the Chinese . " " Well , one day , " Zecca said , " this army will get me and the Chinese together and together we are gon na be the fucking Yellow Peril . "  | " Include me in , " Holliwell told him . " As far as possible . " " There have been Chinese for five million years , man , " the captain said . " I do n't know how long there 's been Zeccas but I know there 's one thing that Zeccas and Chinese have in common . We know how the world goes . " He took a little salt from the edge of his margarita glass and rubbed the grains between his fingers . " We know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever knew . But Zeccas and Chinese will always know . " Holliwell toasted the ancient wisdom of the Zeccas and the Chinese . " Cole does n't know shit . Fat Frank does n't know shit . El General  --  well , he 's an ape . You , sir , " he said , addressing Holliwell , " I do n't know what you know . I wo n't presume to speculate . But things do n't work the way people think . " Holliwell shrugged . " I know that my redeemer liveth , " he said . The Zeccas stared at him . It was too Protestant a text . After a moment , Tom laughed . " We have a proverb , sir , in my grandfather 's country . In his island . I 'm positive they have the same proverb in China . It goes To trust is good . Not to trust is better . ' " " A salute , " Marie said , and they drank the last of the margaritas . " To Sicily , " Holliwell said . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the light from the living room , the shadow of his thick brows masked his eyes , high cheekbones and the arch of his nose covered the play of his thin lips . " To the price of salt , " he said , " and the ten pains of death . Which is all we really know . " Marie sighed . Holliwell held his seat until Captain Zecca rose from the table . He had seen such drinking parties in Vietnam and sometimes they ended badly . Zecca had begun to " sir " him rather a lot , a bad signal . " Next month , " Captain Zecca said , as they all staggered off to show Holliwell to his quarters , " we have to have twenty barrels of green beer . The way things get done in this country we better get on it now . " The room to which Holliwell was shown was small and comfortable , typical of the house ; a touch of suburbia , a touch of Spanish formality . It had its own bath.  | " Green beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good night , Doc , " the captain said . " Great ride . " " Really , " Marie said . Holliwell thanked them profusely , excessively . Washing up in the small neat bathroom , he could hear them plainly when he turned off the tap . They were in the kitchen . " St. Patrick 's Day , " Captain Zecca was telling his wife . " It 's in March . " " Oh , you 're kidding , " Marie said . " Like hell I 'm kidding . I 've got to locate this individual who can dye beer green without poisoning the whole station . " " That 's too goddamn ridiculous , " she said . Sitting on his bed , Holliwell could still hear them . " Some Kraut , maybe . They 've got ta have some Kraut over at the Germania brewery . Maybe he can do it . " " He 'll think you 're crazy . " " Fuck him . " " Tom  --  in this town  --  they 'll dye it with old socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraut , " Captain Zecca said . " We 'll make him drink the first barrel . " Marie was giggling as they went to bed . " Green Tecanecan beer for St. Patrick 's Day . That 's the living end . Will anybody mind if I stick with agua mineral ? " Holliwell heard them laughing together until he went to sleep . Pablo woke to the goony birds . He had propped a chair against the doorknob ; he was lying in a soiled mesh hammock in a bare evilsmellingroom . Roaches in the size and quantity of delirium were scurrying across the slat floor , stripes of hard sunlight came in through the closed battered shutters . He struggled out of the hammockand took a Benzedrine at once . On the floor , he found an empty pack of the local cigarettes ; he poured his remaining tablets into the packet and folded it away in his shirt pocket . His clothes and his body were sweaty and rank and it had been days since he had been able to brush his teeth properly . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastidiousness.  |p174Downstairs  , Cecil was cooking re f ritos in a kitchen off the bar . " Do n't you never sleep , Cecil ? " Without a word , Cecil came out of the kitchen and threw a plastic bag on the bar that contained Pablo 's passport and his turista card . Beside it he placed the blue duffel bag that Pablo had come south with . " Twenty , " Cecil said . " Damn cheap at de price . " Pablo paid him . " De bus station  --  you know where it is . Take de bus to Palmasmake sure . In Palmas go on down to de quays and you see de Cloud . Das de name of her  --  de Cloud . Goin ' to be your new home . " " See you , Cecil . " " Hope so , mon . Hope you be doin ' all right . Find out de use of you , all like dat . " " Shit , " Pablo said . Cecil watched him walk out with his gear and went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile of banana plantation . One of them was enclosed by a chain link fence surmounted with barbed wire ; at its gate was a Coca-Cola sign with its center board replaceable for the inclusion of the name of the establishment on whose behalf Coca-Cola was prepared to extend its welcoming logo . The sign read : " Coca-Cola  --  Bienvenidos a  --  LA COLONIA PENAL . " The bus stopped often and it was crowded . There were a few women with children but most of the passengers were young plantationworkers wearing machetes hung in leather sheaths from their belts . Listening to them speak together in a soft-edged Spanish of which he could pick up scarcely a word , Pablo fell victim to his wonted suspicions . That they were mocking him , taking counsel in avian trills and hisses to plot his undoing , seemed as obvious to him as the cloudless sky and the green mountains . Pablo was scornful ofIII their ill intentions ; he was armed , as was his custom , with a Dacor diver 's knife strapped to his calf and the automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus aroused within Pablo another sensationand it was one on which he scarcely dared reflect . As his guarded glance swept the people pressed close around him , he felt that he could anticipate every smile and gesture that he saw . There was ap175secret self inside him that knew their rhythms and their stirrings , even knew their thoughts . In the hot cramped space he realized suddenly that he had some kinship of the blood with these dark stunted people whom he so despised  --  that they were , however distantly , his mother'speople and in that way , his own . It did not make him feel in the least warm toward them . Palmas was a gas station at the end of a dirt street that led past mean wooden shacks to the ocean . Pablo climbed off the bus with his gear and walked the length of it . He paused at the dockside  --  there were a few shops and bodegas and the office of the captain of the port . Tied up at the two piers were two dozen local shrimp boats of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical colors like the local buses . There was no craft in sight that looked as though it would be the Callahans ' powerboat . He put on his Macklin Chain Saw hat , took his sunglasses from the pocket of his shirt and looked from one quarter of the harbor to the other . Nothing but shrimpers . He walked out on the pier , set his bag down and leaned against a piling , cursing under his breath . From behind the tinted-glass windscreen of the Cloud , Mr. Callahanand Freddy Negus watched Pablo on the pier . " That 's our boy , " Callahan said . " Gawd , " Freddy Negus said . " What 's wrong with him ? " Callahan demanded . Callahan was drinking a rum and soda and the sight of it in his hand at so early an hour made Negus uneasy . " He showed up , did n't he ? He 's just a deserter , that 's all . " He saw Negus glancing at the drink in his hand and put it down beside the Fathometer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake ? Billy Budd ? " " You hire these monkeys and then I got to keep them in line . I 'll tell you , Jack , I 'm getting plumb wore out with it . We could have taken on a local crew for this . " Callahan picked up his drink angrily . " I told you , Freddy , did n't I , Freddy , that I did not want a native crew for this ? I need people I can control and who need me . I need a guy with a little technical savvy who 's a long way from home and who ca n't take to the hills if the deal goes queer . A deserter is perfect . That boy you 're looking at is gon na work out fine . "  | " Gim me a dope run any old time , " Negus said . " At least you know what you 're up against . " " Hell , Freddy , " Callahan said , " you been out in all the weather . An old pirate like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the galley for another drink . " Maybe that 's the problem , " Negus said . " We 're all getting a little old for piracy . " He kept on watching Pablo , fretting down on the pier . " And when 's Deedee coming back ? We want to clear to-night . " " She drove over to Pico to find a dentist , " Callahan said , measuringout his rum . " She 'll be back in plenty of time . " " Fuckin " ell , " Freddy Negus said . He put his baseball cap on and went out on the little bridge beside the wheelhouse , squinting into the sun . " Hey , you ! " he called down to Pablo . " Pablo ! Come on up here . " Hearing himself hailed from one of the ratty shrimpers , Pablo picked up his bag and started along the pier . There was a white man in a baseball cap on the bridge of the largest of the boats ; the man was waving Pablo aboard . It occurred to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . He had suspected contrabandingbut nothing so complex . " Tabor ? " the man asked him when he stood abeam of the shrimper . A black man who had been painting bright yellow numerals on the vessel 's prow turned to look at him . Pablo nodded . " Come aboard , Tabor . " Pablo stepped over the rail . The man who had called him was tall and lean , tanned , with lazy faded blue eyes . He indicated a hatchway behind the wheelhouse and followed Pablo through it . " I 'm looking for the Cloud , " Pablo explained . " You 're standing in her , " the tall man said . Mr. Callahan came forward from the galley , a glass in his hand . " Well done , " Mr. Callahan said . " Right on time . " Pablo turned from the tall man 's steady gaze . " Christ , Mr. Callahan . You told me you had a powerboat . You did n't say nothing about shrimping . " He felt disappointed and betrayed . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't see any sails , do you ? " the tall man asked him . " This is a powerboat. "  |p177Pablo  turned to face him . " No question about that . " " What 's happening right now , " Mr. Callahan said , " is that you 're being engaged as a crewman on the shrimp boat Cloud . We 're registeredout of Marathon , Florida . We 're licensed to fish in the territorialwaters of the United States , of Mexico , Belize , Compostela and Tecan . Any other questions will have to wait . O.K. ? " " What am I working for ? " Pablo asked bitterly . " A percentage of the catch ? " " T'hat sounds like a question to me , " the tall man said . Pablo looked at the man again . From his accent , Pablo made him out to be a white Bahamian . Hope Town , Spanish Wells , some sorry-ass town like that . A mean redneck . " Let me introduce Mr. Negus , " Callahan said . " My number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug of tobacco in his cheek . " And let me hasten to assure you that you 're not being taken advantage of . If we were looking for cheap labor there 's plenty to come by down here . You 'll do fine but you 've got to go by our rules . " Negus was looking out at the pier through the hatchway . " Where you from , son ? " he asked Pablo . " Texas . " " Lay out your gear for us . " He indicated Pablo 's bag and the deck of the passageway in which they stood . For the first time , Pablo noticed that the interior bulkheads were paneled in dark wood , the rubber-matted deck was spotless . He opened his bag and spread his store of worn work clothes , toiletry bags and slickers across it . Negus crouched to rifle through it and immediately picked up the plastic bag that held Pablo 's passport and tourist card . He handed it over to Callahan . " We ask everyone to do that for us , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too careful . " He looked the passport and tourist card over and returned them . Negus took Pablo 's wallet from him . There was nothing in the wallet except what was left of his money . Negus gave him back his wallet and motioned him up against the bulkhead . Pablo leaned forward on his palms . " Sorry , " Mr. Callahan said . In a few moments Negus had the automatic and the diver 's knifep178out on deck . Grimly , he turned out Pablo 's trouser pockets one by one . " What 's all that for ? " Mr. Callahan asked mildly . " Just for protection . " " Now how in hell , " Mr. Negus wanted to know , " did he get down here trussed up with all that weaponry ? Do n't you think it 's a bit odd , " he asked Callahan , " that they did n't get it off him ? " " Nobody ever searched me , " Pablo told them . " I come down to Vizcaya on the bus . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . All the way from Matamoros , Mexico . " Negus sighed in exasperation . " I mentioned that it would be our rules , " Callahan said to Pablo . " If any of that troubles you "  --  he motioned back toward the shacks of Palmas  --  " we 'll pay your way back to Vizc and wish you luck . Otherwise  --  our rules and no questions . That way you 'll make out very well indeed . " " O.K. , " Pablo said . " I guess I 'm with you . " " You ca n't keep that pistol while you 're aboard , " Callahan told him . " You might have an accident . The knife , O.K. " Negus gave him his Dacor knife . " Wear it on your belt where a man can see it , sailor . " " Welcome aboard , " Mr. Callahan said , and took his drink aft . He walked through the galley and into a dark compartment where the forward ice hold should have been , closing a door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galley to the tinted glass fronting the pilothouse . At the forward end of the passageway in which he stood was a Modar UHF transmitter and a CB . There were A and C Lorans and what appeared to be a **28;8565;TOOLONG scanner . The wheelhouse cockpit had a brand-new recordingFathometer . From the dock the Cloud had appeared to be a moderately clean eighty-five-foot shrimper . Inside she had the appointmentsand equipment of a cutter . " I take it , " Mr. Negus said , as he watched Pablo look over the electronic gear , " that you 're familiar with this stuff ? " " More or less , " Pablo said . " Everything the latest boats carry , we carry , " Negus told him . " Your big Texas boats have all this stuff . "  |p179Pablo  did not contradict him . They went out on deck and Mr. Negus led him aft . Between the mainmast and the upright outriggers , some kind of extra compartment had been constructed . Its uppermost section rose above the level of the main deck and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , would be the compartment into which Mr. Callahan had taken his drink . Pablo decided that he would venture an observation . " Never seen that space on a Texas boat , " he said to Mr. Negus . " You 'll see it on plenty of boats down here , " Negus told him casually . " When a man takes his family out , he needs more space . The Cloud 's a home , you understand . It 's a lifestyle . " " Oh , " Pablo said . There were two ice holds , empty and with their hatch covers off . Aft of them a hatchway led down to an airless lazaret where there was a single bunk and some bales of chafing gear . " You can sack out for a while if you like , " Negus told Pablo . " But we 're going out before sunset and I want everybody standing to . " " Roger , " Pablo said . " Tino can fix you up with boots and whatnot when he 's finished painting . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on up to the pilothouse and we 'll tell you what you need to know . " " Yes sir , " Pablo said out of instinct . Down in the lazaret , he took off his cowboy boots and lay down on the bunk . The sheet smelled freshly laundered , the pervasive odor of diesel fuel made Pablo feel somewhat at home . A powerboat . He lay low for a while , listening to the slap of water against the boards , the sounds of the quiet harbor . At some time during his rest , the woman came aboard ; he heard them call out to her from the pilothouse and then her voice with theirs in a muffled echo through the holds that lay between his quarters and the dark compartment . Late in the afternoon he looked up to see the black man who had been painting the bow framed in the hatchway above him . The man dropped a pair of white rubber boots down the hatch : each boot had a rubber glove stuffed inside it . " Vamonos , muchacho . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He rolled out of his rack and put on a pair of clean woolen socks , pulled the boots over them and jammed the gloves in his pockets . Thep180black man stepped back to let Pablo climb topside and extended his hand . " Soy Tino . " Tino 's hand was like a shard of coral . Pablo wondered what Tino made of his own soft hand . " Pablo . " " Buenas . Usted es norteamericano , no ? " " Texas . " " Dat 's what I figger , " Tino said . " Sure is a fine boat . " " Surely is . Dushi , we say on my island . " " Which is that ? " " Sint Joost , " Tino told him . " You see it couple days . " " Be my pleasure to be the fuck off this coast , I 'll tell you . " Mr. Callahan , looking fresh and sober , was standing on the docksidein conversation with a Compostelan in a smart naval uniform . They were laughing together . Pablo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Negus , who had been leaning on the rail beside the pilothouse , sauntered back to Pablo and Tino . " Reckon we 're just about set , " he told them . " You do n't want the net rigged ? " Tino asked . " Do n't want the outriggers over ? " " Fuck it . We 're not fishing tonight and we do n't have to put on a show . Weather 's nice , so we wo n't need the stabilizers . Just get up steam and we 'll ease along out . " Tino took off for the engine room . " Like the boat ? " Negus asked Pablo . " Dushi , " Pablo said . Negus did not smile . Holliwell traveled down the Rio de la Fe from a town called Tapa . The Zeccas together drove him there from San Ysidro . If Captain Zecca had received a line on Holliwell in his workday morning 's mail , he gave no indication of it . At the same time , it seemed to Holliwell that they talked less on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more bland . On the dockside , they shook hands with him gaily and assured him that it had all been fun . Holliwell , quite sober now , felt inexplicably forlorn watching their Honda disappeardown Tapa 's single muddy street , headed for the potholed , switchbacking mountain road back to the capital . In the guidebook Holliwell carried , the local boat was recommendedbecause it afforded a leisurely journey in the course of which one might inspect the magnificent gorges of the river valley , see the Indian towns on the bank and the landings where the hacienderos waited for their mail and their mail-order luxuries from the capital . Unlike Compostela , Tecan had no highway between her coasts ; eastwestsurface transportation was by boat along the river . It was a route much used by Forty-niners during the California gold rush to avoid the journey around Cape Horn ; an arduous and malarial journey in those days that killed a quarter of the men who undertook it . Now the traffic moved by diesel-powered launches manufactured in Bremen , and the one moored at Tapa 's dock looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeccas ' convenience and his own impulse to flight , had booked passage on the night rdpido and engageda cabin . An Indian boy carried his bag aboard for a quarter ; he found his cabin small but very clean , with a brass-knobbed wooden door openingon an interior passageway and a second , louvered door opening to the deck . The sheets on the bunk were starched and spotless ; there was a ceiling fan , mosquito netting , even a glass and a jug of agua purificada . Holliwell took a bottle of the local rum from his suitcaseand mixed himself a rum and water . When he finished it , he drew back the mosquito netting , lay down on his bunk and went to sleep . Rdpido or not , the boat stopped many times during the night ; so often that Holliwell within the first two hours of darkness was moved to rise and take his bottle out on deck . The night was clear . The mountain ranges rising close over the river on both sides cut off the moon from view but its deflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slow-seeming tawny river . Night birds and howler monkeys sounded from the banks , their calls echoing in the gorges . Holliwell sat down on a gear locker and looked up at the stars . According to his guidebook , there were jaguar in the valley.  |p182The  finca landings were lit by the headlights of parked jeeps . The forks of white light would flash of a sudden from the bank ahead , lighting the dun river in their glow , and the boat would slow and ease toward the bank until the searching spotlight over the wheelhouse picked up the vehicle and the waiting men together with a thousand spinning moths , their bright wings flashing a thousand colors in the glare . Into this well of light , the Indian deckhands would toss the starboard hawsers and the men on the bank secure them to rusty weighted barrels while the vessel 's fantail swung completely around in the invisible current and her engines labored full astern . When the boat was steady against the bank , the engines still rattling astern , the deckhands would push a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though under fire , would commence to carry ashore a few dozen sacks and crates . These the finca 's peons would carefully load in the waiting jeeps . Within a few minutes it would be over , the hawsers cast back aboard and the boat under way again . Astern of them , the landing would quickly dissolve into jungle darkness , like a theatrical tableau suggesting dreams or fairy spectacle . In the Indian villages along the Rio de la Fe there were no jeeps nor were there electric lights of any kind . The people on the bank would signal the boat with torches and the offloading would be lit by the pilothouse searchlight and a fire burning in an open pit beside the bank , with the hawsers secured around stumps . Handshakes and greetings would be exchanged on the run ; the language of discourse was not Spanish . Boys would leap aboard from the outer darkness , prowling the decks like scavengers , accosting the few cabin passengersin sight with things to sell  --  feathered rattles , stuffed lizards , a live snake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would watch his unlocked cabin door , although there was little behind it worth stealing . At the last possible moment , the boys would leap ashore in the firelight and the boat continue its slow passage down the river , Although it was difficult to see in the darkness , the smoke and the confusion of lights , the Indian villages seemed to Holliwell as poor and mean as the slums of the capital . There was a distinct sour smell to them , not quite fecal , but like rust and congealed blood . And in spite of their size and remoteness , they seemed to him like some North American cities he knew in that what they brought to the landscape that surrounded them was not a sense of settlement and advance but of concentrated misery , despair.  |p183Between  stops , he walked the upper deck  --  the few other cabin passengers were not in sight . For a while he leaned with his elbows against the rail and watched the men in the pilothouse . The helmsmanwas an Indian like the rest of the crew , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned up and down to resemble an Australian bush hat , staring out into the darkness with a faint smile . Behind him the captain bent over a chart in the light of a desk lamp shielded from reflection by a tar-paper shade . The captain was a heavy red-faced man of some African blood with fair wavy hair , wearing a starched white shirt and narrow black necktie . Neither man appeared to speak to the other . In time the mosquitoes drove Holliwell back to his cabin , and he lay down on his bunk buried behind the netting , smoking . He was thinking about his wife and his daughters , and how , though he had stayed  --  would never leave now  --  he had lost them . He had thought to do everything right  --  he believed in love . There had been something , perhaps , that it was not possible for someone like himself to know and his not knowing it had lost them . The hard way , little by little , without an outcry of any sort . Thoughts of loss could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consuming since the start of his journey was a regular part of his metabolism now ; he was half drunk , almost at peace . He nearly slept . When he went out on deck again it was getting light , the sun rising over flat jungle and grassland where lean cattle grazed . The mountains were behind them to westward , rising abruptly in a massiveescarpment that burst into bright green with dawn . Within minutesthey were coming into a town of sorts  --  a city . Unpainted wooden houses with slant roofs stood on stilts above a black beach where gulls picked at piles of refuse and open clay gutters emptied a viscous stream into the brown river . Puerto Alvarado . As the launch pulled for the right bank , Holliwell could see ahead a line of tin-roofed warehouses where two freighters stood at moor , and beyond that the river widening into a delta bordered with mangroveswamp , and beyond all , almost motionless in the morning light , the expanse of pale green ocean . While they tied up , Holliwell worked on his expense records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , offering to carry his bag or shine his shoes , spoke Caribbean English and required eye contact of him.  |p184Holliwell  's shoes were already polished to a high gleam . He attempted to oblige with the eye contact but his eye was uneasy ; he was scanning the dock for menace . The most menacing presence he could detect was that of the Guardia Nacional  --  four troopers and an officer , who exuded a floral aroma and regarded him in an unfriendly fashion . A few yards behind the Guardia pack  --  at the edge of the dockside street  --  a tall black man in a white shirt stood beside a Willys jeep of World War II provenance . " Paradise ? " the man asked Holliwell . " Lovely , " Holliwell told him . The man took Holliwell 's bag from him with a sure hand and placed it in the back of the jeep . " Wait , " Holliwell said to him , " there must be some misunderstandinghere . " The black man frowned at him . " Mon , I just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tol ' me O.K. " " No , " Holliwell said . " I 'm not going to Paradise . " The man turned toward the boat in no particular hurry . Holliwell retrieved his bag lest he incur some manner of fee . At the dock , the last Tecanecan passengers were disembarking under the Guardia 's glare . There appeared to be no other gringos aboard . " Where you want to go then ? " the tall man asked Holliwell . Holliwell looked at him and at his jeep . " Well -- to the Islas Airlines office . And the airport . " " Jolly good , " the man said , taking the bag back . " I take you to the office . " He climbed in beside the driver and they started up . The riverfrontstreets had little Spanish about them . The peeling woodenhouses , the tin roofs , might have been in Kingston or Belize . " How about the airport ? " Holliwell asked . " You not gain ' there today , mistuh . Nor tomorrow neither . " " How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because Islas got only one plane and she 's over in Respina and she not about to fly . They got to get some parts from up San Ysidro . Carry dem over on de boat when they feel like . " " Christ , " Holliwell said . The streets and the people in them were more Latin American as they approached the center of the city.  |p185Indians  with marriage bands around their sombreros carried slaughteredturkeys and heaps of faggots over the cobblestones . " If it was my airline , " the driver said , " I run it differently . But it 's not . " " I guess I 'll check in at the office anyway . " " Humm , " the driver said . " Want me to wait ? " Holliwell thought about it . " No , do n't wait . I might be a while and maybe I 'll get lucky . " " Thas a good way to think , " the Paradise driver said . " Thas the way I think . " In front of the Islas office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The office was in a part of the city off the central plaza , across from the government technical school . It was decidedly Spanish America here . The high curbs were set with ancient paving stones ; the cathedral he saw through the jacaranda trees of the plaza was at least as old as the late eighteenth century . There was an old stone building beside it of about the same date , with Guardia sentries at its doorway . The judicia . Behind a desk in the airline office , an Oriental woman sat listlesslyon a high stool , projecting inexpressible melancholy  --  Masha Kuligina with another life to mourn , upon whom karma had bestowed exotic rebirth and strange displacement . Holliwell realized at once that there would be no good news from her . In the most decorous and formal Spanish at his command , he inquired the state of transportationto the islands . She answered him , as he knew she would , in English . Things were more or less as the driver from Paradise had describedthem . The plane was in Respina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed parts but had not yet returned . There was no question of alternative arrangements because the government regulations about the franchise were very rigorous . The islands and the coast were a military district and could not be overflown by any aircraft other than those authorized . There was indeeda boat that ran to the islands but it ran only on Wednesdays and Saturdays , the same days for which the plane was scheduled . A boat had left that morning . The journey was over ten hours because it stopped at several places along the coast as well as at each of the fivep186offshore islands . One waited on the quay in the morning for a place , it was always very crowded . " You speak English very well , " Holliwell told the woman . " Do you speak French also ? " The woman looked at him sadly . In his irritation , the observation and question had been a bit patronizing , an impertinence to a Vietnamesewoman of culture such as this lady unquestionably was . She allowed him to realize this and smiled without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . Of course , Holliwell thought . Bien sun . Our worlds have touched before and we both know it , do n't we ? In any case the small opportunity he had offered himself for second thoughts on the spot seemed just about removed . Now he would be obliging Ocampo . He was there ; he was being seen , as Oscar had put it , to be there . He glanced about the broken streets and wondered by whom . Taking his bag once around the square , he paused on a guanospottedbench to have his shoes shined yet again by a gaunt nineyear-old . It was a grim little plaza ; the people lounging in it were as poor as any that Holliwell had ever seen . The interior of the cathedral , though it contained some good carved santos , was mainly a Babylonian horror with mindless rococo gilding and a curious encoffinedChrist . When he had finished inspecting it , he carried his bag down a street of notaries and public letter writers to the clapboard riverfront . The jeep was parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver stretched out in the front seat with the brim of a Ralston Purina cap pulled down over his face . The ships at the adjoining wharf were loading sacks of coffee beans and the longshoremen workingthem wore sweatbands across their foreheads and machetes at their belts which gave them a piratical look . The sleeping Paradise driver awoke to the whistle of a diesel launch from the interior which was pulling for its berth . He raised his hat and looked at Holliwell sympathetically . " We goin ' to Paradise , you and me ? " " I guess we are . How much to go there ? " " Ten dollars , " the man said . " And I did n't say pesos , did I ? I said ten dollars U.S. "  |p187Holliwell  shrugged . ' The tourists always sayin ' I told ' em ten pesos , " the driver said as they turned to watch the arriving boat . " Never told anyone dat . Ten dollars . One with Mr. Hamilton on it . " " I got you , " Holliwell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the Paradise . A short rounded man with a deep tan , a gray goatee lengthening his thick jowls . His wife or girlfriend , gray-blond with a leathery brown face like a boot about to crack . A thin , florid man wearing a Yucatecan Panama . The driver took their bags and everyone exchanged small nods . Holliwell sat in the back , beside the slight man with the Panama . " Ralph Heath , " the man beside Holliwell said , as they drove over a straight dirt road through the mangrove swamp . The man held his Panama in his lap . " Frank Holliwell . " " Been here before ? " He was an Englishman of about fifty , with a mean-featured hard little face . A drinker  --  the pouches under his eyes were the only slack part of him and distended veins ran down the sides of his nose . " Never . " " Alvarado 's a hole . But it 's a nice coast if that 's what you 're after . Coming place . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once or twice a year . Sometimes on business , sometimes just for the beer . " " From England ? " " I live in Miami now , " Heath told him . " I have ever since our fruit company merged with yours . You 're American ? " " Yes , " Holliwell said . And after a moment , he shouted to Heath over the engine noise . " How do you like Miami ? " " Never looked back , " Heath said . They drove under the mangrove wilderness opened to sandy beaches and palm groves ; the road was only a packed sand track near the water 's edge . The cheerlessness of Puerto Alvarado fell away in the sunlight . The drive took hours . They sped past clapboard fishing villages in the palm groves where nets were drying on poles along the beach andp188brightly painted boats with cabined wheelhouses were hauled up , buccaneer fashion , on raked plank dry docks beyond the tide line . Almost every house had in front of it a small garden of plantains and an overturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit company houses , numbered and painted yellow . A good half of them appeared to be unoccupied . On the beach road they were constantly passing women carrying baskets or pots on their heads . From time to time , Holliwell would see a basket that looked to have the ghost of an African design or a pot inlaid with a highland Indian pattern . But for the most part they were factory-made , bought in Alvarado or from a passing Syrian . Between the villages or on the edge of them were some compounds of vaguely ecclesiastical design that looked as though they might be missions . Holliwell said something to Heath about its being a fine place to be a missionary in . " Too damn many of them , " Heath shouted to him . " That was your company 's policy in the old days  --  the more of the bastards , the merrier . They 're regretting it now . " " Why 's that ? " " Why ? Because they 're a pack of reds . Why should n't they be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm assuming you work for a living . " " I teach , " Holliwell said . " Ah , " said Mr. Heath , and he fell silent for a while . " It is n't religion they need down here , " Heath declared after five minutes . " They 've had plenty of that . It 's the Pill . If this coast had half the population it has it would be in damn fine shape . " Heath was speaking at the top of his voice , conceding their driver only the virtue of some necessity . The couple in the front seat stirred and half turned round in embarrassment . " Then who would pick the fruit ? " " Hardly any fruit to pick these days . Less than half the crop there was ten years ago . We package coffee and bananas now  --  we 've lost most of the bananas to blight . The next thing we need to package is tourism and we do n't need all these imported Jamaicans for that . The other way round  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seat cringed visibly . The driver , one arm resting on the back of his seat , looked with an amiable countenance at the track before him.  | " In the old days , " Heath said , " when the bananas had a few bad years the pickers moved on . No more . The sensible thing for us to do is to airlift the lot to the Pacific coast where we 're bloody crying out for pickers . It 's the sensible thing , so naturally these psalm singers are determined to stop us doing it . They turn the people against us and against the government . They 're masters of propaganda . " " Really ? " Holliwell asked . " God , yes . Down here they 're meek and mild . Lambs . Then they go abroad and thunder for blood and revolution . They 've got powerfulfriends , you know , and they use them to the hilt . Dignity of man , " Heath said sourly . " Where I stand a man 's got dignity or he has n't , rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . You ca n't send it to him in a CARE package . " " I do n't really know the situation , " Holliwell shouted back . " So I ca n't say . " " Fair enough , " Heath told him . " You 're one among many . " The hotel called Paradise was neither as transcendent nor as banal as its name . It consisted of a number of simple wooden bungalowsaround a well-tended garden . At some distance from the bungalowswas what appeared to be a disused airplane hangar but which revealed itself on closer inspection to be a terraced dining room , open to the beach . Where the tool shops might have been there was a kitchen and a crescent-shaped bar ; an old nineteen-forties jukebox stood at the edge of the large cement floor between the bar and the decks of tables , blasting Freddy Fender 's rendition of " El Rancho Grande " into every square foot of covered space . At the water 's edge was a dock with a couple of numbered boats tied up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof . Not paradise but nice enough . In the office bungalow a hefty Spanish woman registered the guests and dispensed keys to the bungalows . Holliwell stowed his bag in the plain bungalow and took a cold shower , the only kind available . When he had changed clothes , he poured himself a drink and went outside to sit in the shade of an arbor of bougainvillea . After he had been sitting for a while , a dark-skinned young man came up from the bar , where he had been drinking a beer with the driver , and asked Holliwell if he wanted to go diving . Holliwell looked at the young man and then at the placid ocean.  |p190The  question aroused in him a thrill of fear and also a longing for the depths , for the concealment and oblivion of blue-gray light at sea level minus seventy . " It 's been a while , " he said . " If you want , " the young man said , " we run you through a checkoutin the morning . Bring it back . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A reliable-looking kid , he thought . Undersea images flashed in his mind , fans and parrot fish , silvery barracuda . Things being what they were , why not ? The young man gave him a card with the diving package rates . Holliwell put it in his pocket . As the young man walked back toward the dive shop , Ralph Heath came by carrying a glass of white rum and soda . " Going diving , are you ? " " I 'm thinking of it . I have n't in a long time . " " Nor have I. I got thumped on the head in Bogota eight years ago and I have n't been able to dive since . Only wish I could . " " Did you ever dive around here ? " " Oh , yes . Here and in Jamaica . Malta . Yap in Micronesia . I was very fond of it . " " How did you come to get thumped ? " Holliwell asked . " Accident , " Heath said . " I 'll tell you  --  Playa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about six miles south of here . There 's a reef close inshore  --  then she drops off about three quarters of a mile out . It 's a wall  --  a real chiller-diller , that one . Grand Canyon . " " Many sharks ? " Holliwell asked sheepishly . It was a question one was not supposed to ask . " Well , " Heath said , " this is the eastern Carib , chum . You 're likely to see the odd shark out there . " " I suppose , " Holliwell said . " Another good place is near there . By the American Catholic mission . There 's one reef that starts in about eight feet of water , then slopes down to forty , then flattens out and drops a mile out . Good snorkeling there as well . " " How 's the shop here ? " " Quite good actually . Sandy 's a good boy . I used to dive with his father ten years or so ago . Nice family they are . Head and shoulders above the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will go out , " Holliwell said . " I 'll go look up Sandy in the morning . " " You 'll have a jolly good time , Holliwell , " Heath said . Pablo leaned idly on the rail as they cleared the harbor , the rubber work gloves still in his back pocket . His want of a bath was bothering him acutely now and he wished that he had asked them about it while the boat was still hooked up to a dockside water line . If there was a woman aboard , he reasoned , the Cloud must have a head and shower somewhere . No harm in asking , he thought after a while ; there might be enough water from the evaporators or a fresh-water supply somewhereaboard . They seemed to have everything else . He went forward to the wheelhouse and leaned his head through the hatch . Negus and Callahan were in the cockpit chairs . " If we got some time now and there 's water enough , could I clean up ? I ai n't shaved nor showered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's enough , " Callahan said . " Right behind the galley . Knock first . " He went back to the lazaret to get some fresh clothes and his toilet kit and then up to the galley . Behind it was the door to the dim compartment into which Mr. Callahan had earlier disappeared with his drink . He knocked twice on it . " Hello , " called the voice of Mrs. Callahan . " Sorry , " he said . " Come on in . " He opened the door just as Tino , out on deck , was hauling away the hatch covers that closed off the windows of the compartment from the outside . As the space filled with light he saw that the compartmenthad the same dark paneling as the forward passageway , that there was a striped chaise longue , some captain 's chairs with brightly colored cushions , even a bookcase . In the center of the stateroom was a round table with metal studs , an electric fan resting on it . Mrs. Callahan was sitting in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book on her lap.  | " On your right , Pablo , " she told him . She pulled the terry-cloth robe she was wearing a little farther down over her tanned thighs . It was all she had on , Pablo thought . " I 'll go easy on the water . " In the pocket of Mrs. Callahan 's robe , Pablo espied a bottle of pills . There was a small swelling distorting the patrician contour of her high cheekbone and long jaw . " Yes , do , " she said . Pablo had him a shit , shower and shave ; his thoughts were carnal . Soaping down , he sang to himself . " I ride an old paint I ride an old danI 'm going to Montana for to have a hooly-an . " The water was warm , hand-pumped out of an overhead pipe through a rubber nozzle . He shaved slowly and deliberately , his shoulder propped against the bulkhead beside the mirror , riding with the slow roll of the boat , still singing . When he came out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elbow , her hand covering her mouth . When she took her hand away , he saw that she was smiling . " Do you play the guitar ? " she asked him . " No , " Pablo said , feeling surly and put down . " What a shame , " Mrs. Callahan said . He climbed out of the fancy compartment , the kit and soiled clothes under his arm , and went out on deck . Low even seas slid westward under the light wind , over the horizon was a thin line of cloud , nearly pink in the fading light . Big bitch thinks I 'm comical , he said to himself . She thinks I 'm the fucking entertainment . Tino was checking out the net 's chain line as Pablo tossed his things down into the lazaret . " Callahan bring his old lady every trip ? " " Mostly does . " It was not his custom to speak of white women with dark people but resentment and desire made him uneasy and perverse . " She spread it around any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding toward the casing of the out/rigger 's auxiliary motor . Pablo watched him drop the chain line on the deck and walk over to slap the top of the casing . " You can work it from right here or from the cockpit . Can haul it up by hand on the windlass if you needs to . " Pablo fixed his eyes on the tall St. Joostian and leaned against the upright outrigger . He was being turned around again . He watched the other man 's eyes and thought of the denticled palm . " We ai n't fishin ' tonight , " Tino said , " but I tell you in case like . Over dere  --  " He pointed to a rolled-up smaller net against the port rail . " Dat 's de tri-net . We haul her up every half hour maybe on a lay line . You ever been shrimping before ? " Pablo only stared at him . " Well , " Tino said , meeting his stare , " you best be told so you know what you doin ' . Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that right ? " Pablo asked him . " Believe it , " Tino said , and picked up the chain line again . " That 's real good of you , Tino . " " Para servile , " Tino said softly . During the next two days , the Cloud ran the coast of the Isthmus . Most of the time they were out of sight of land , in the seas between the Swan Islands and Serrana Bank . Pablo watched and listened , made himself useful and kept his nature to himself . It was like a breakdown cruise ; they were testing the electronics gear and the auxiliary diesels ; making plans to which he was not party . Mainly , he realized , it was he himself that they were observing . Tino , Negus , both of the Callahans would engage him from time to time in strained quiet conversations that varied in nature according to their several styles . He made it his business to be pleasant , incurious and resourcefulin small matters . He had a turn at the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatches . Once , when they were anchored off Gracias a Dios , he had a skinny dip and was confirmed in the conviction that Mrs. Callahan had eyes for him . The swim also gave him a chance to study the boat 's dynamics from the business end , and although he was no engineer he could see that even in basic construction the Cloud was not what she appeared . She had what the Coast Guard would call a false hull ; a squat duck of a shrimper at first and even second glance above the waterline , her linesp194were modified to make her capable of formidable speed with the diesels engaged . A contrabander , as he had assumed . On the morning of the third day out , they dropped the hook off Palmas and every one of them but Tino set about getting drunk . Their intemperance worried Pablo , who thought it unbusinesslike . They smoked a great deal of grass as well and tried to press it on him . Pablo had settled himself into three Benzedrines a day and he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An indistinct notion presented itself to him : that the company 's undisciplined selfindulgencemight eventually be turned somehow to his advantage . But for the moment he was content . After siesta , on the same day , the lot of them held a conference in their improbable saloon space . Pablo was not invited . He had found that standing in the forward ice hold he was able to hear quite clearly everything that was said on the far side of the bulkhead , but he knew better than to employ this convenience prematurely . When the afternoon passed and he was not summoned , he felt confident that they were satisfied with him . In the evening , he and Tino took the anchor in and lowered the stabilizers . Mrs. Callahan cleaned the kitchen . It seemed he was in . In the years since the city 's history had caused the decline of the lakeside district , the most desirable section of Tecan 's capital was in the hills west of the center , on the only slope not occupied by squatters . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few had moved to the hillside neighborhood ; it was in this section of Tecan 's capital that the Zeccas maintained their pleasant house . The slope section had always been known as Buenos Aires . Its central area of four blocks or so was the remains of a colonial suburb destroyed by a series of earthquakes and contained the remnants of a baroque church and a colonnaded building which had been a theater , a market , or the palace of the Inquisition depending on the books one referred to . A market was what it had become , and it had probably always been one . The outer streets of Buenos Aires , between the colonial core andp195the new residential sections , had been set out in the nineties by a class of people who had been to Paris once or twice and remembered it imperfectly but fondly . Any foreigner taking a turn round the Buenos Aires district and attempting to pursue the promise of an isthmian Montparnasse would be disabused as quickly as a stroller among the flats and terraces of a production of La Boheme  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian vendors , a streetlight , a gray stone high Renaissance structure , a mansard roof might bring a fleeting taste of some dead comprador 's lost city of light . The gentry responsiblefor this modest hall of mirrors were melancholy internal exiles . But they were also great dreamers , so it was impossible to be certain just how far , during the brief period of agrarian prosperity and large foreign loans , they had intended to pursue this fancy . Their greatest achievements in its realization were marked by the blighted lakeside barrio ; Buenos Aires , like the Paris of Thiers , had been early aborted . But for reasons of recent history , that section had held its thin illusion more successfully . Squatters who tried moving into some of the empty buildings were summarily dealt with and sometimes murdered outright by the Guardia , an indication that there must be a continuing affection for the district on the part of a faction in the present regime , men of sensibility less taken with Houston and Atlantathan their colleagues and relations . There were many religious houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of professional men . The National University used a few buildings there , and there seemed to be a great many private language schools doubling as pensions whose brochures were available through foreign travel magazines . High on the slope , the President 's family were constructing a new , glass hotel . Early on a winter morning , just after first light in the hour before the day 's heat descended on the inland sea , a young woman in jeans and a neat white blouse was walking downhill past one of the grander of the gray stone buildings , humming to herself and carrying a stack of books and a thin plastic briefcase . Obviously a student , her very presence , her books and high spirits , contributed to the decorous European veneer of the neighborhood . She was at the point of entering another stone building a little further down the hill when she slipped on a worn marble step at the street entrance . She kept her footing but her books and the briefcasep196scattered over the pavement . Bending to recover them , she looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit advancing to help her . The man had just stepped out of a Fiat in the narrow street ; as soon as he was out the door the car sped away . The man was elegant and professorial , as he briskly gathered up the young student 's fallen books ; he smiled in a dignified way and spoke to her softly to ease her embarrassment . It was a charming incident in its contrast to the petty cruelties and palpable brutality that characterized so much of the street life of San Ysidro . The two , student and professor , looked like the kind of people for whom the Malecon and the Buenos Aires district had been constructed . " What an opportunity , " the elderly man was saying . " In my youth one could always make the acquaintance of a pretty fellow student in this way . " " One still may , " the girl said gaily . She was naturally pale , though blushing under the compliment . Her face was angular and handsome ; in body she was a bit squat and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books as the two of them went into the building before which she had had her small accident . A worn brass plaque on the door identified it as a residence of the Christian Brothers . Once inside they walked up a dusty flight of stairs and to the head of an immaculate corridor which had windows with lace curtains at each end . A European brother met them there , politely asked their names and told them that room five had been engaged for their seminar . The corridor had plastered walls and a wooden floor on which their steps reverberated . In the room numbered five , five men sat at a polished round table . All five stood at the elderly man 's entrance ; they seemed to strain toward him , wanting to touch him . He was the object of their happiness . " Compaiieros , " the elderly man said , " salud . " The terseness and dignity of his greeting held them in place . They took their seats again . With a courtly smile , the old man placed the stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extended his hand to the young woman . " I am Aguirre , " he told her.  |p197The  girl took his hand and held it . Her accident had in fact been the signal for his safe entry . " We met once , Don Sebastian , but you would n't remember me . When you left we were all afraid . . . never to see you again . " " But here I am , " Aguirre said . " And I 'm not Don Sebastian to you , companera . " All in the room were smiling now . Aguirre himself was not well and was extremely tired . Within the past week he had visited foreign friends in several countries , had even made the transatlantic journey from Prague , a process which never failed to exhaust him utterly . In Prague , in addition to business , there had been late nights with his old friends from the Spanish war  --  much spinning out of the past and hardly any talk of the future . Their relentless nostalgia discouragedand exasperated him and to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  brothers and more than brothers from the terrible days of the defense of the University City  --  tiresome and redundant . Even more depressing to him than the burned-out nature of so many old comrades had been the occasions of his lack of communication with the young . These , fortunately , had been few  --  but they frightened him . His courtesy had served to conceal much impatience with empty nostalgia , rhetoric a la disco , self-indulgence and mindless bohemianism . He was relying on the same courtesy now , for few in the room had anything to tell him , in spite of his three years ' absence from Tecan . He was eager for action , for hard information that would complete his strategic assessment , that would move things forward . There was only one person in the room who could provide for his requirements in this regard and he had now to wait , benign and courtly , until the real conversation could take place . As he pretended to listen to young Comrade Rodo present her report on the student situation in the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to read in the faces of the men around him , in their manner and demeanor , some record of the three years he had lost of Tecan . Of course , they in their turn were seeking out the reverse side of the record in watching him . The concentration that seemed focused on Rodo 's assessment , as she shuffled her coded aides-memoire , was profound . Across the table from Aguirre sat an Atapa Indian called a la Torre . Taller and more broad-shouldered than most Atapas , he wasp198otherwise physically typical of them . The Atapas were a Malay-like people , and even their artifacts resembled those of Southeast Asia . During the conquest , the Spaniards had thought of the Atapas as docile , although in the period before independence they had come to learn otherwise . A la Torre himself was a small landowner and while it would be unfair to speak of him as vicious , he was , drunk or sober , feared by Indians and whites alike . A kulak , the Russians might call him . But their social designations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made on a la Torre 's life by both gentry concerned with mineral rights and ultra-right fanatics . Each had failed and some had occasional mortal consequences . He was the unquestioned leader of the southern group of Atapas , in spite or because of the ways in which his life differed from most of theirs . In his youth , he had been converted to Adventism by North American missionaries , but his enthusiasm for the gospel and its evangelists had evaporated during his two years at the National Technical College , obviated , it seemed , by his discovery of the Republic and the machine . His experiences had left him with a curious and volatile variant of the Protestant ethic . He was an unstinting and indefatigable worker of strong ambition and great physical strength . His small holding , given over to scarce and hence relatively valuable vegetables and a small dairy herd , had been cleared from scrub jungle by his own muscle and sweat . When he had occasion to hire the labor of his fellow Atapas he paid them as generously as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced him to see his own and his people 's work as a humiliation , surrounded and dominatedas he was by those who did none or lived off that of others . All work to a la Torre was physical work . Doctors and teachers he recognized as necessary , but they were not workers . Making reluctant exceptions for these professions , he was consumed by a serious and quite personal hatred for large groups of people whom he saw as living without working . The rich and the priests did none and he hated these most of all . The bourgeoisie did none . Nor did the gringos , the gachupines , the soldiery . Their existences consisted in living by trickery off the work of others and he was prepared to kill them in good conscience as he would those he caught stealing or cheating himp199at cards . He was thoroughly honest and a leader , not cruel but unyieldinglyjust in accordance with his perception of justice , which owed something to that of the Adventist God . Looking covertly into his black Tonkinese eyes , Aguirre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social forces as to pose a dilemma , one that Aguirre might find the energy to discuss over good Pilsener with his old comrades in the Charles Square . In terms of socialist humanism , a la Torre was almost too good to be true . That history has provided us in our poor country with such treasures , Aguirre thought gratefully ! And que huevon , the old man thought . Invincible ! Seated beside the formidable Atapa  --  owlish , effervescent with wise humor and contained intelligence  --  was another personified dilemma , Hector Morelos de Medina , one of the few surviving members of the old Communist Party of Tecan and one of Aguirre 's oldest friends . Ironical , learned , the best of company and , most rare in San Ysidro , a true wit  --  Morelos ran a bookshop in the Buenos Aires neighborhood . For many years as a Communist in Tecan he had led a terribly dangerous life , endured exile , acted with the greatest bravery in the face of torture and excruciating sacrifice . Now , like Aguirre 's other old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a North American spy . Intelligence abroad had not identified the motive for his defection but it did not seem to be ideological . Presumablyit was banal like Ocampo 's . Aguirre had always been close to Morelos ; certainly he preferred his company to that of Stakhanoviteslike a la Torre . On the other hand it could not be said that he was profoundly shaken . He had known many defectors in his lifetime and plenty of them had construed for themselves the best of motives . Sometimes the nature of their treason was objective only . It was disagreeable and regrettable for Sebastian Aguirre to now consider his friend Morelos an enemy in war , but it was certainly not impossible . Senorita Rodo finished her report and everyone nodded . She was Urban Youth , Studentdom , Woman ; an essential . A good-hearted rich kid who might or might not have a mean streak for good or ill when the time came . No question of guts ; she was risking interrogationby the Guardia . Aguirre gave her his choicest approving smile . Beside Rodo  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mestizo of poor origin who had worked his way to enlightenedwealth and been rewarded with sharp dealing and extortion at the hands of the ruling clique . He was also in competition with foreigners . Most of the local capitalists endured and took what they could for themselves ; Baz had the gift of resentment and more balls . He preferred facing revolution to being openly cheated . Baz was as honest as a la Torre and ran the clandestine organization in San Ysidro effectively . He had moments of tactical brilliance . Yet , he would not go the distance , Aguirre thought . The man was no traitor and no weakling but they were simply not fighting for the same things and Baz would finish in Miami , embittered , a gusano , as the Cubans said . He himself had not the remotest idea that this would come to pass , but Aguirre , listening to his report on the state of the nation 's finances , felt fairly certain of it . Naturally , he was always ready to be proven wrong . Next , inevitably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golz was of partly Swiss origin , another honest man conversant with and not unsympathetic to Marx . Inspired by the example of Calles , a disciple of Gustavo Gutierrez , he thought of himself as an intellectual . Aguirre , as much a connoisseur of engage priests as he was anticlerical , thought him fatuous . But there was no question in his mind of the necessity of having Golz , and in his portly , priestly way , Golz was a fanatic . Aguirre was much more certain of Baz 's ultimate desertion than of Golz 's . His fanaticism might take him either way  --  one could never be sure with priests . The moderates , Baz and Golz , were ill at ease . They were aware of the patronizing and faint scorn of nearly all the other participants , and the monsignor , as he described conditions on the Caribbean coast , was particularly aware of the distaste and distrust with which the terrible a la Torre watched him . Even young Rodo curled her lip as she listened . And of course Morelos , the CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this ecclesiastical presence . Listening carefully to Golz 's report , and giving no evidence of any suppressed contumely , was the man whom Aguirre had come to see . He was a man in his middle thirties , dark-skinned and massive , with a face not easily forgotten . His hair was thick and straight , he was bullneckedand broad-faced and down the length of his broken nose from brows to nostrils was a jagged crooked scar , showing the red imperfectlyhealed flesh of a deep wound . The coarseness of his featuresp201and the disfiguring mark of violence seemed to sum up the fortunes of a Tecanecan campesino ; in fact the young man 's origins and career were in no sense proletarian . His father had been a botanist at the Institute of Sciences and he himself had degrees in art and in art history from the University of California . For years he had been a moderately successful painter , spending most of his time in New York and in Mexico City ; presently he was chairman of the Art Department at the National University . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ henchmen and with quite a few Americans in the diplomatic community . He was the man , Aguirre thought , reassured , watching him nod encouragement to the rambling monsignor . They thought well of him abroad . The Americans thought they knew him , liked him , had no reason to fear him . He looked as vital , as capable as ever . He was the man who would lead  --  during the revolution and afterwards . Among those in the room , only Aguirre and the young man himself realized this . The realization had taken Aguirre a long time to arrive at ; the young man himself seemed always to have known it . From his suit pocket , Aguirre drew a forbidden cigarette  --  Benson &; Hedges  --  and waited , smoking , for the mock council to draw to its conclusion . The scarred young man was his only true collaborator among the lot of them and there were things now that required urgent consultation . The pro forma strategy session was not ended easily . All participantsrequired a stroke for their self-esteem , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrazos exchanged with the venerable and distinguished visitor . It seemed a long time before they had all gone and Aguirre was left alone with the scarred man , whose name was Emilio Ortega Curtis . When they were across the table from each other in the abandonedconference room , Aguirre lit another cigarette and offered Ortega the pack . Ortega smiled and shook his head . " How was Prague ? " " Beautiful as ever . A bit subdued , as you may imagine . " " Well , " Emilio Ortega said , " too bad . But that 's their problem , of course . How did you find our friends abroad ? " " How ? " Aguirre weighed his words . " Cautious . Patronizing . Faux naive . " " Then nothing 's changed . "  | " Nothing essential . Tell me about Tecan . " " As they say in the Koran , Don Sebastian , no one has promised us tomorrow . But I think , my friend , you 've lived to see the revolu-tion . " Aguirre 's frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I just seen the provisional government  --  more or less ? " " Some of it . The same sort of people . Except , of course , for Morelos . Whom we know is a Yanqui spy . " Aguirre nodded . " Sad , no ? I ca n't know how you feel , Emil , but  --  myself  --  I 'll miss him . " " I miss him , " Ortega said . " I 've already mourned for him . " They sat without speaking , observing something like a moment of silence for the man 's treachery . " If one must have a moral , " Ortega said , " I propose : Look too long into yourself and you wo n't know whom you 're seeing . " " He was always , " Aguirre said , " an exquisite ironist . " " Well , " Ortega said . " Small suffering countries do n't require ironists . When we require ironists we 'll produce our own . Without help from the United States . " " But not too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisional government  --  what did you think of them ? The usual suspects ' ? " " Yes , I suppose . I have hopes for Golz , as priests go . " " I do too , " Ortega said . " His organization within the church was built very discreetly and subtly . He 's lined up some solid ones for this stage . " " Godoy , I think , is his man , no ? " " Godoy is among his chiefs . Like him , but not a man to my taste . " " You 're not Spanish enough to appreciate Godoy . " Ortega shrugged . He was indifferent to the legend of Spain and the self-obsession of Spaniards . Even Tecanecan criollos like Aguirre , with their peninsular pieties , offended his indigenismo . " I 'm a man of UCLA , " he said . " In spite of what they say , we were n't all mystics in Los Angeles . " " Clearly not , " Aguirre agreed , then changed the subject . " You 're aware , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spies . Their activity is more than routine . We have this from primary sources abroad . "  | " We 're aware . They 're here for the show , so we 're making it hot for them . In fact , a la Torre shot one in the mountains last week . " " You 're joking ! A U.S. citizen ? " Ortega was unable to repress a smile ; in a moment his expression sobered . " Not merely a U.S. citizen but an imported gringo . " Dr. Aguirre whistled between his teeth . " A man named Cole showed himself in Extremadura . He claimed to be a journalist and full of sympathy and he expressed great interest in visiting our military formations . He had just come from Oscar Ocampo . A la Torre took him up to First Brigade . He talked a great deal and he demonstrated familiarity with every sort of weapon . He had been in Vietnam  --  he told us this himself . We held back awhile  --  we wanted to be fair and avoid a provocation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I approve , " Aguirre said . " Let them stop taking us for fools . Let them find out that Yanquis die as easily as peasants . And perhaps , " Aguirre said , " the regrettable time has come to do something about Oscar . He seems to enjoy making difficulties . " " The time has come . But we have to clear it abroad  --  or so we 're told . " " I grant you dispensation , " Aguirre said . " Let the Compostelan comrades have him . " He stood up from his hard-backed chair and began pacing the room . Then tiring , he took a different chair . " Thank God for the Atapas , " he said , his eyes closed . " The Fascists truly screwed themselves when they went mad over those mineral rights . They tore the last spines out of the social structure . " Ortega smiled in agreement . " For forty years , " Sebastian Aguirre said , " we worked to bring the Atapas to our side and like pious donkeys they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the mineral grab . " " We have them now , " Ortega said . " Moreover , the government has taken to drafting more and more Atapas into the Guardia to find reliable troops  --  and also of course to demoralize them . ' When these Indians get out they 're changed men . And right now half of the Guardia is Atapa . " " My God , " Aguirre said , " it 's going to happen ! I do n't know if I ever believed it . "  | " There were times , my friend , when you were the only man in the country who did . " " Morelos and I , " Aguirre said . There was a tray in the center of the table that held a pitcher of cold coffee and some cups . Ortega poured them both a quarter cup and they drank . " I want to talk strategy now , " Aguirre said . " Is there a chance that Senor Morelos or these good brothers have placed some electronicinstruments here ? A bug ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not here . " " You must realize , " Aguirre told him , " that I have instructions for you . More help from abroad . Most of it is so much shit . So now I 'll ask you what you propose to do . " " With pleasure . Sunday  --  a demonstration here in the capital . A dangerous one , a bad one  --  but as you 'll see a necessary one for our purposes . They 'll bring in more Guardia from the mountains . A day passes and we hit the Libertad Guardia barracks on the edge of town in small force with automatic weapons . The Guardia troops there are slightly less than half of them Atapas  --  we do n't expect to take it but anything can happen and we 'll see . Should we take it , we wo n't try to hold it but we may gain some arms and recruits . While this is happeningthe main force will move . The five Atapa brigades will take command of the cordillera and liberate the fincas . In a single offensivethey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the Pacific highway and the river . The Guardia will never dislodgethem , even with aircraft . This is the important thing , and you may depend on its not being in the newspapers . We 've had tons of automatic weapons and surface-to-air missiles flown in and we have n't lost a single shipment . Guardia troops going into the mountainswill meet Atapas more numerous and better armed than themselves . They will have no support whatever from the population . The Guardia air arm has no experience against surface-to-air missiles and the bastards do n't know how to fly anyway  --  at least not in a combat situation . The gringos trained them in close air support and if they try doing what they 've been taught they 'll cease to exist in those mountains within an hour . The ground-to-air missiles are miraculous ; they 're easy to hide and two half-trained men can use them . They'llp205be the only ordnance from the socialist bloc we 're using and they 're untraceable . " " Instructions specify Israeli weapons wherever possible . " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyoneknows the Israelis handle supply for the gringos here to see to the Guardia 's needs and Israeli weapons for the most part are what we 'll use . If they 're captured we can say we got them from the Guardia . " " Bravo , " said Sebastian Aguirre . " Now prior to the main thrusts we have a diversion on the Caribbeancoast . " " Interesting , " Aguirre said , " but it 's proverbial they do n't care to fight down there . " " Forget proverbs . It 's going to be a good test . We 'll hit the foreignproperty there and we 'll kill some notable sons of bitches . The Yanquis are convinced things are safe there , they think it 's a little apolitical paradise and they want to use their property to build resorts now . We shall disillusion them and upset the digestion of their guests . Maybe we can capture a Club Med , eh , Sebastian ? " " Very bad for our fighters ' morale , " Aguirre said drily . " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize this ? " " To his credit , he did . He arranged for excellent weapons from the old-time smugglers there , , so the enemy will be badly outgunned , at least in the beginning . It will frighten the gringos , move troops from the real theater of war and politicize the population . Godoy also cultivated the active support of some progressive missionaries . " " An effective man , for sure . " " No doubt of it . Now we ca n't depend on success here  --  the methods are primitive , the Guardia may intercept our weaponry , we may not prevail . But nothing is lost if we fail here and it 's a traditionalregion of exploitation . We owe our people a front there . " " One word of advice , " Aguirre said . " Do n't leave Godoy running a diversion . He 's too good , especially with the Indians . " " I agree . While the southern Atapas are fighting under a la Torre , we 'll have Godoy with the Atapas in the north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in military control . " " It 's going to work , " Aguirre said finally . " Clearly . The mountains are the key , the Atapas . The roads and the rivers closed , the coast unsafe , insurrection everywhere ! Everyp206night rockets in the capital . Within ten days we 'll have Tecan . San Ysidro falls as an epilogue . " " Abroad , " Aguirre said , " they 're afraid of the North Americans . " " This is shortsighted of them , with all due respect . They , of all people , should be aware of how it 's going in the world . For one thing we have a most moderate non-Marxist manifesto prepared and the North American embassy will be among the first to get copies . More importantly , a lot of gringo asses got kicked forever in Vietnam and Congress will never authorize any intervention on behalf of this present government . " " Very good , " Aguirre said . " We can give the Yanquis the stick and the carrot  --  their own favorite method . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring them . They 've got that coming for their own murders . " " Precisely , " Ortega said . " And what can they do  --  destabilize us ? Destabilize Tecan ? " The two men laughed together . " I want a drink , " Aguirre said . " I want to drink to this now in case I die tomorrow . " " Only one , compadre , " Ortega said . " You 're a living treasure of the nation at the moment and I want to keep you that way . " " A piss-poor treasure . " " Nonetheless , " Ortega said , walking toward the door , " you are hereby nationalized . Later I can lay flowers on your monument  --  now I require you alive . " During the time that Ortega was out of the room , the beating of Sebastian Aguirre 's heart made him clutch his breast . He felt nearly pulverized with excitement at the prospect of victory yet terrified as he had never before been of loss . Someone had said that the secondsaddestthing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition and that the saddest was to achieve it . Who had said it ? A Frenchman ? Clemenceau ? No , no . Oscar Wilde . He sat looking through the curtainedwindow at the pseudo-Parisian facade on the building across the street . After a few moments , Ortega returned carrying two glasses and a bottle with a few inches of Spanish brandy . He poured out the liquor and handed a glass to Aguirre . " Salud , " Aguirre declaimed , and drained his glass . Ortega wasp207amused and touched at the antique chivalry of his style . He returned the toast . " Where in the world , " Aguirre asked presently , " did you find a la Torre ? The man makes nee tremble . " Ortega laughed . " Yes , a la Torre was a find . A fierce one , no ? " " It is n't his ferocity , " Aguirre said , " it 's his essence , his life . The man is history . The personification of every Marxian insight . EverythingI 've ever believed about socialist humanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So true , " Ortega said , " as to be a vulgarization . " Aguirre laughed in spite of himself . " Compadre , we are all vulgarizations of history . We have to live it out by the day  --  life , unlike sound philosophy , is vulgar . " " Indeed . And you approve of Golz ? And Godoy ? " " Golz , yes . For this stage certainly . And even more of Godoy , although I know you dislike him personally . " " You 've rarely met the man , Don Sebastian . " Under Ortega 's disapproving eye , Sebastian Aguirre poured himselfanother small brandy . " I 've never met a la Torre until this morning , still I approve of him because of what I know . Now let me tell you something about the Godoys of our world . " We 'll be off to Spain , damn the place , Ortega thought . Always Spain . Why not Algeria ? Why not Angola , Vietnam , China ? " In Iron we faced the Carlists . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had great conviction . In a way , they were the most reactionary of all the Fascist troops . We called them Fascists too but they were not really such . They were fighting a jihad . " Ortega nodded politely . " I do n't think you 've ever heard me speak against the Spanish Republic , " Aguirre went on , " but between ourselves there were some rather sordid bourgeois elements active within it . Some of these thought to act progressively and enrich themselves at the same time through the seizure of church lands in the north . Madre de Dios , what a storm this produced . In the name of Juan Carlos , this fugitive from a Velazquez , led by their priests and by mounted artistocrats  --  the real thing , Emilio , not like these ratones here but men who spokep208their language and their dialect  --  they turned out to destroy us in the name of Jesus Christ . " " Like the Cristeros in Mexico , " Ortega suggested . Aguirre made a sour face . " The Cristeros were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caricature . " Ortega felt the first surge of sympathy he had ever felt for Cristeros . Farce to the gachupin Aguirre because they were brown AmerCI ; icansand not men of Holy Spain . " These Carlists were in the grip of a metaphysical politics fromIli which grew baroque mutant fruit . There arose such arabesque absurditiesas anarcho-Carlism  --  all men would be equal and all politicalorganization rooted in the sky . The preposterous Carlos would beIllking-surrogate for Jesus Christ himself , who would be the true , directlyresponsible King of Spain . Under His reign there could be only virtue and honesty , liberty , equality , fraternity based on the Sermon on the Mount . Imagine it , Emilio , we found ourselves fighting creaturesout of Engels ' history , men who in their hearts believed much of what we believed , who should by rights have been shoulder to shoulderwith us , but were fighting us to the death . Well , we could never say so in those days and circumstances but many of us admired them . " " Courage and conviction are always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you , Emilio , say ' so what ? ' And I agree . But let me tell you that I think that Godoy is a bit like those men . I think he fights for the peasants and the Indians because whether he knows it or not , he deeply desires the just rule of the Lord . Probably , he will neveril realize this  --  certainly we must hope not , for his sake . I 'm sure he sees himself as a humanist and a student of Marxism . But I thinkIj unconsciously it is the kingdom of God he fights for . Emilio , the best revolutionaries , the first Communists may come from among such men ! " " This must be what I do n't like about him , " Ortega said , smiling . " I admit only that he 's good at his job and for now that 's good enough for me . " " Ah , yes , " Aguirre said archly . " UCLA . He fights for Christ and you for John Dewey . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a brandy for him/self , " what shall we do about our late comrade , Morelos ? In fact , " he told the old man , " I 've already decided . But I should like your opinionall the same . " Aguirre was taken aback and impressed . He felt justly chastened . Ortega had terminated the anecdotes and the levity with talk of treasonand its consequences . It was calculated , brutal and to the point ; it reminded Aguirre of the Old Man . The Old Man might have done it the same way . How right he himself had been , Aguirre thought , in deciding that Ortega must lead . " Do you think me sentimental ? " Aguirre asked his young leader . " Do you imagine I would plead for him ? " Only once in his career had Aguirre opposed an execution for reasons of friendship and his advocacyhad nearly cost him his own life at the hands of Andre Marty and the NKVD clique . Only Stalin 's intervention had saved him . Never again had he undertaken to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result , further reflection had always convinced him that the policy of unyielding severity was ultimatelycorrect . In the case of Morelos it was not in question . There could be no mitigating circumstances to regret here . " Perhaps I 'm sentimental , " Ortega said , " because my first instinct was somehow to spare him . For his long service and his gray hairs . I thought we might dispatch him abroad with his ten favorite classics in the presidential airplane . Or wrap him in ribbons for the Yanqui embassy . " " But now you think otherwise ? " " Tomorrow , when our people here are underground and you and I are in the mountains with First Brigade  --  Senor Morelos will be arrested by the Guardia as a proven Communist . Then you may be sure he 'll howl for the gringos and he 'll learn whether they retain any interest in him after he 's no use to them . " Aguirre finished his brandy . " This , " he said , " is only simple justice . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was not made to be a leader . " Now let me tell you something , Don Sebastian  --  pardon me for addressing you so  --  we are fighting for a new Tecan with a new leadership . The leader will not be John Dewey and he will certainly not be Jesus Christ . Not Bolivar , or Jefferson or the ghost of Popep210John . Not , as we say , the People . Nor even the Party , because all of these entities are either dead or not yet truly formed . " " Who then ? " " With permission , " Ortega said , " and with your invaluable as-sistance  --  me ! " " Am Ito take this for cynicism , Emilio ? " Ortega looked away from him and out through the curtained window . " Cynicism ? That I  --  a plain man , a mediocre artist , perhaps even a mediocre fighter  --  take it upon myself to bring justice to our accursedsuffering country ? To bring health to her children , dignity to her desperate poor ? To replace her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make housing , hospitals , schools for her masses of ignorant ? To leave sound philosophy and engage life which we both know to be so vulgar ? To dispense life to some and death to others in the name of a form of humanity which for all we know may never exist ? " The old man listening to Ortega rose from his chair . Ortega turned his back on him . " Hombre , " Ortega said , " there is no Jesus Christ . There is no philosophy in a shack or in the gutter . There is not yet even such a thing as the People . There are only poor creatures like you and me , my comrade  --  and we propose to bring these things about . We proposeunto death . " Ortega turned toward Aguirre again . " Cynicism ? I would have to be mad , would I not , to cherish all this cynically  --  in the name of my own glory ? Perhaps I am mad to propose these things at all . Yet , as an act of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on Ortega and took a step toward him . The old man spoke truly of himself when he said that he was not sentimental . He had heard such words from the cynical and the mad . He had seen much of war and executions , death and cruelty . He raised his palsied hand in a fist . " I do n't know , " he said to Ortega , " whether one may thank History . She 's a cold bitch . But I thank her now . I thank her with love that I 've lived to see you and this day . I beg her to allow me to see the days that are coming . You are my son , Ortega . . . " The old man laughed with pleasure and to cover his emotion . He could say nop211more and advanced no further . It was a time to refrain from embracing . Perhaps , later . Ortega returned his salute with a smile . He was embarrassed at having run on . He supposed that the suggestion of his cynicism had provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temperament . " And you , my father , " he told Aguirre . " Without you  --  nothing . I thank you . " If the gringos could see us here , he thought , it would amuse them . " So , " old Aguirre said . " Death in one eye and dishonor in the other , eh . We shall have a drama . " They raised nearly empty glasses to each other . " Victory , " Ortega said . " Patna o muerte . " The dark came down quickly after sunset . The lights of the coastal fishing boats grew dimmer and , more distant abaft ; eastward the eveningstar was rising , the wind steady . The Cloud plowed into its faint resistance making seven or eight knots . From the galley came the smell of frying steak . Pablo sat beside the after hatch , watching the wake in starlight . Freddy Negus came out on deck and called him forward for chow . Mrs. Callahan was leaning over the galley stove , a rum and tonic secured on a rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan , there was a huge pot of boiled greens . " She 's a good feeder , " Pablo said . He was cheerful . " Oh , you bet , " Mrs. Callahan said . " Get yourself a drink and go sit down . " Pablo helped himself to a moderate measure of light rum and took it down to the fancy paneled compartment . The crew 's lounge . Tino came down behind him , smelling of diesel fuel , and ducked into the head to wash . At opposite quarters of the mahogany table , drinks set before them , were Negus and Mr. Callahan . Pablo picked himself a chair and sat down . After a moment Tino came out of the head , ducked up to the galley to draw a Coke from the freezer and joined them . Pablo looked around at the men in the compartment ; all of them were watching him . Callahan looked boozy and affable . Freddyp212Negus , scratching his ear , looked unhappy ; Tino , sleepy-eyed now , expressionless . " What do you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do I think about what , Mr. Callahan ? You got a nice boat here . She 's a good feeder . I ai n't even done any work yet . " Mrs. Callahan , in the galley , was humming " Amazing Grace . " " You will , though " Callahan said . " For example , can you handle an M-16 ? " " I do n't see ' em every day . But I 'm familiar with the weapon . " " We may be dealing with unpleasant people and we may have to defend ourselves . How 's that grab you ? " " That 's how it always is , " Pablo said . After a moment , he said : " I hope you 're not talking about the U.S. Coast Guard . " " Christ , " Negus said to him , " you think we plan to shoot it out with the goddamn U.S. Coast Guard ? I was hoping you had more sense than that . " " We wo n't be dealing with any U.S. authorities . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll even see them . So do n't worry about that . " " Local-type cops , maybe ? " " Not too likely either . If we have that kind of problem we tend to run . We 're a lot faster than we look . Thanks to our engineer . " Pablo surmised that Mr. Callahan was referring to Tino . He nodded . " It 's thieves I 'm thinking about . We have a few exchanges to make with various parties that we 'd like to see secure . Just so everybodykeeps their side of the bargain . " Pablo sipped his rum with satisfaction . It was everything he might have hoped . " You got the right man , no shit , Mr. Callahan . I never backed out of a hassle in my life and I never let my people down neither . " " We your people ? " Negus asked him . " You treat me right , you 're my people . Anybody that knows me knows that . " " We do n't let our people down either , Pablo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in business a long time . " Pablo raised his hands , palms up.  | " Good enough ! " Mr. Callahan rose to his feet . " Let 's have another drink , cornpaneros .... Deedee , " he called to the galley , " come and have one with us . " He started toward the single step that led up to the galley space and in climbing , tripped and staggered . Negus and Tino exchangedlooks as he did so . For a moment , the Callahans whispered together in the galley , then returned ; Deedee Callahan carried a tray with the bottles of rum and of tonic and some iced glasses . When she had settled herself in a captain 's chair everyone except Tino poured himself another drink . Then it seemed Mrs. Callahan was lighting a joint . She passed it to her husband , who passed it to Tino . Tino took two deep tokes and passed it on to Pablo . On this occasion he smoked some and passed the joint to Negus . Negus passed it back to Deedee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same fashion and then Mr. Callahan declined a third toke . " Das all for me , " Tino said . " Me , too , " said Pablo . " Well , " said Mrs. Callahan , " the more for me . " Pablo felt her eyes on him . He looked through the smoke into their blue watchfulness . Tino stood up suddenly . " Goin ' forward , " he announced . " Got to watch de bottom out here . " " What about your chow ? " Negus called after him , but he was gone . Mrs. Callahan leaned back in her chair and finished the joint . Callahan was pouring himself another drink , Negus moodily finishing the one in his hand . The woman worked her joint down to a ring of resin , balancing it on her lip with a hemostat . When it was finished , she put the hemostat away . " Want to help me out , Pablo ? " " Sure , " Pablo said . From the galley , they could see Tino sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly green in the unnatural light of the Fathometer . A soft merengue was coming in over the UHF ; Pablo watched Mrs. Callahan 's lower body , encased in the tightest of faded denim jeans , sway mellifluously to its beat . She was gathering metal plates from an overhead dish rack . For the first time he noticed ap214printed sign posted over the stove that read YOU BETTER BELIZE IT . When she turned to him he was laughing at the sign . " What 's funny , pardner ? " She smiled and brushed the damp hair from around her eyes . He could not tell how old she was  --  forty , more or less . Her face was lean , creased around the eyes , sun-cured . ' When she set the dishes down on the counter beside the stove , he felt her breast brush his bare arm , the nipple distinct and distended under the soft cotton of her sweat shirt . " Just feelin ' good , " Pablo said . " Feelin ' good is easy , " Mrs. Callahan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflection . " No , " he said after a moment . " Not so easy . " They watched each other , locked in the drug ; she was looking at him with wary amusement , still easing to the merengue . " Funny kind of boat this is , " Pablo said . " Yes , " Deedee Callahan assured him . " This is your basic funny boat . Now do something for me , Pablo . Give the boys their vittles . " She took the steak from the pan and placed a strip on each of the five dishes . On each dish she spooned out some of the greens from the stewpot , then handed two of the plates to Tabor . She winked at him and motioned with her head toward the dining compartment . Pablo did not chafe under his servitude . He served Negus and Mr. Callahan graciously , setting the steaming plates before them . I goddamn well got her , he was thinking . Any old damn time . When he went back into the galley she gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forward and placed it on the chart table ; Tino gave him a brief bad eye in return . Pablo smiled . The man must know , he thought , what was passing between himself and Mrs. Callahan . There was a plate for him steaming in the galley ; he brought it down to the table and seated himself across from Negus and Callahan . Mrs. Callahan joined them presently , carrying her own plate and some salsa , salt and pepper on a tray . The Cloud took the gentle seas with a slow fore-and-aft pitch . " Beats shrimping , " Pablo said , breaking the silence that had settledover the dinner table . He assaulted his tenderized steak with concentration . " We 'll do some shrimping by and by , " Mr. Callahan told him.  | " But as you have undoubtedly surmised  --  shrimping is not how we make our way through life . " " Yeah , " Pablo said . " I surmised that . " " What else you surmised ? " Negus asked him . " You told me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so I did n't ask you any . " He looked around the table . " I 'm easy to get along with . " " Fred , " Mr. Callahan said to Negus , " you 're the best seaman in the world but you 're a balls of a politician . " He turned his soft look on Pablo . " What we 're wondering , fella  --  you being lately in the Coast Guard and all that  --  is what you make of us . We 're interested in your educated guess . " " O.K. , " Pablo said . " You 're running something . I would have said dope but I do n't think so now . If you were going up to the States from a Dutch place like St. Joost I 'd say diamonds . But you say you 're not messing with the States . " He cut himself another piece of steak . " Computer parts maybe . Calculators , like that . Only this boat 's not big enough for a high-scoring run with that kind of weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing and another  --  guns . That 's a good old-time trade . " " Yes , it is , " Callahan said . " If we 're going to Cuba , " Pablo said , " we got our work cut out for us . " " We 're not going to Cuba . " " Well , good . If it 's not there it could be any one of ten or a dozen places . There 's lots of petty-ass politics down here , right ? I do n't even follow it . " " All right , " Callahan said . " Let me give you the word on a needto-knowbasis as it were . You do n't need to know where we 're going . In a day or two we 'll be in Nieuw Utrecht on St. Joost taking on ice and groceries . After dark we 're loading cargo on the other side of the island . What we want from you is a little help with the groceries and what we especially want is you standing by while we take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the moment of truth , hombre . You 'll get to do some shrimping tomorrow night too , in case you 're interested . " " I wish someone would tell me what I stood to get paid , " Pablo said.  | " When we figure our costs , " Negus said , " we 'll tell you . " " It 's a reasonable question , " Callahan said equitably . " You can figure on at least five hundred a day for the next few days . It 'll beat your Coast Guard pay . " " I guess so , " Pablo said . " Think that 'll keep you happy ? " Negus said . " Because we have to keep you happy . We insist on it . " " I think everybody 's gon na do all right , " Pablo said . Everyone in the cabin laughed ; Pablo found it disconcerting . When dinner was over , Negus and Mr. Callahan took their coffee to a small compartment aft of the central cabin and closed the teak door behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The radio in the cockpit was tuned to one of the missionarystations that broadcast Jesus messages  --  the Baptist missionarieshad the most powerful transmitters in the islands . " Whereunto shall I liken the Kingdom of God ? " a youthful Nebraskanvoice inquired over the UHF , " it is like leaven ... " Tino was making notations on his Loran chart . She had gone back to smoking grass . It was the strongest grass Pablo had ever drawn of and she seemed to take joint after joint of it . After two or three tokes , the enveloping papers grew moist and tarry with deep green resin . Pablo declined . When the washing up was finished they went back to the cleared table . " What brought you down here , Pablo ? " " Just wandering around , " Pablo said . He was thinking that they were all the same . " You 're kind of a throwback , are n't you ? In the jet age ? " " I been on plenty of jets , " Pablo told her . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it all right until they started turning me around . " " I thought that was what they were all about . " " Some guys will sit still for anything , " Pablo explained . " They got no self-respect . Any kind of militaristic trash , they do n't object to it . " Pablo had picked up the anti-militaristic angle working at the Coast Guard district headquarters in Boston and incorporated it into his line . It had worked fairly well with the girls around there , and Mrs. Callahan , although not so young and tenderhearted , seemed to be a little like them.  | " So you got radicalized , is that it ? " Pablo felt as though he had been softly counterpunched . He rolled with it . " I had this CPO on my case who was like a Fascist-type guy . He kept at it , so I cold-cocked him . Broke his jaw . I was looking at time , see what I mean ? So I skipped . " " Is that a literal story , Pablo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of symbolic ? " " What ? " Pablo asked . He did not necessarily insist that women believe everything that they were told , but he was not used to their calling him a liar . She put her joint down and looked sincerely thoughtful . " The thing is , " she said , " when you hear the same kind of story from a lot of different people you wonder about the little details . Because no two things ever happen the same way , do they , Pablo ? " " I guess not , " he said . " Of course , they do n't . So you tell me that story and right away I want to know  --  because I 'm a curious sort  --  what 's special about Pablo Tabor . As opposed to all the other guys who broke the CPO 's jaw and so forth . " Smart , he thought . But smart or not they were all the same . " A jaw got broke , " Pablo told her , " and it was n't mine . Somebodytried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill and on this boat and that 's my story . " " And they call you Pablo . Is that a nickname or what ? " " It 's my name , " he told her . " But it 's Spanish . " " My mother was Indian , " Pablo said . It was true to an extent , but to what extent was a question lost in centuries . " I knew it , " Mrs. Callahan said quietly . That 's what she goes for , Pablo thought . He had run across it before . He was aware that she had eased her chair against his and he felt her body again , her long leg in smooth clean denim . " This funny boat where you live ? " he asked her . " So it would seem , " she said . " It just goes on and on . " " Maybe you do n't like it too much . " " It has its moments . " When he put his hand against her soft sheathed thigh , she was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid his hand down to her knee and back up , fingering an inner seam and the flesh it lined . Then he closed his fist and rested the back of his hand on the film of denim . It was a physical stalemate . With Tino in the cockpit , Callahan and Negus on the other side of a door , there was nothing more he dared do . " You take your pleasures where you find them , do you , Pablo ? " " My kind of life you do . " " Mine too , " she said . She turned her head to look at him and he saw that under the weathered skin , the various set wrinkles and the small boozy sacs below her eyes  --  there was something like a kid about her . " Hey , " he said after a moment , " we 're gon na get in trouble . " He was embarrassed at the standoff and his palms were beginning to sweat . The woman laughed silently . " Trouble ? " " Ai n't we ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " on this funny boat ? " The small teak door to the inner compartment opened and Freddy Negus put his head out . In the moment , Pablo decided , Negus had seen all there was to see . " Jack would like you with us for a while , Deedee . If you do n't mind . " She rose slowly from under Pablo 's hand , her own hand touched his shoulder . " Right you are . " Negus was watching Pablo as he held the compartment door for Mrs. Callahan . " Why do n't you get some sleep , son ? " " Thought you might want me to take the wheel from Tino . " " Tino 's all right . If he wants a few zees we can go on automatic for three or four hours . " " Well , O.K. then . " He stood up and stretched . " Guess I 'll go back aft then . " Negus nodded and they exchanged good-nights . Ambling back to the lazaret , Orion ablaze over the starboard quarter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lean over the rail . He was flushed and horny with his conquest of the soft rich lady . As he lounged , scheming in the starry darkness , he became aware of voices sounding from somewhere in the innards ofp219the boat . He was standing over the forward ice hold . The voices were those of Negus and Mr. Callahan . Pablo took a look around and lowered himself into the halfcoveredhold ; its interior still smelled of shrimp and of another substance , vaguely familiar but beyond his recall . There was a half inch of water on the flooring . Moving to the bulkhead closest to the compartment in which he had taken dinner , he pressed his ear against the damp boards . It was almost completely dark where he stood , except for the scattering of stars visible beyond the edge of the hatch cover overhead . " The old Jew 's losing his grip , " Callahan was saying in his whiskey-confident voice . " He 's hitting the sauce . There 's a certain vacancy there . " " I would n't attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be unwise . " " It would be plumb fatal , " Callahan said . " Even half out of it old Naftali 's worth ten of the punks you see around now . " " Speaking of punks . . . " Negus began  --  but Callahan cut him off . " Speaking of punks  --  stay off the kid 's back . I do n't want him getting all disgruntled and paranoid . We do n't have to live with him long and he 's going to come in handy . " " Handy for what ? " Negus asked . " For playing kneesies with Dee is all . " " You playing kneesies with him , Dee ? " " I confess , " Pablo heard her say ; he was startled . " I was playing hot kneesies with him . I dig him . " " If you fuck him , " Callahan said , " that rather makes him one of the family . I think that 's going too far . " Negus uttered a series of low cautioning obscenities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its socks up . We 're doing serious business and the whole vessel 's stoned , drunk or sopored . " There was a brief silence and then laughter . " Pablo 's all right , " Callahan said . " For our purposes . " " I got ta admit he ai n't as bad as some of ' em , " Negus said . " He 's a hard-ass and that 's good if he knows his place in things . " " I think he does , " said Mrs. Callahan . " Pablo Tabor is one of life 's little yo-yos . He wants to please and he 'll do just fine . " His ear pressed against the cold sweating woodwork , Pablo'sp220mind beheld the picture of a red yo-yo on a red , white and blue string with a store sticker on it that said " Made in Japan . " He had forgotten that he was high ; he was more puzzled than angry . I 'm gon na fuck her brains out , he thought . Negus was swearing again . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was armed to the goddamn teeth . Shit ! " Another silence and Negus said : " Tino do n't like him . " " Tino 's not too big on the whole number , " Callahan said . " Well , " Deedee Callahan said , " Tino 's a fucking mystic . How can you go by Tino ? " " I 'm inclined to go by him , " Negus said . " I been with him fifteen years in all weather . " Crouched in the hold , Pablo heard a step on the deck above him . He heaved himself against the boards and saw a shadow pass between his hiding place and the night sky . It would be Tino , he thought . Coming up from the lazaret . From going through his gear . He bent lower and listened . " Naftali still take his money up front ? " It was Negus . " First thing that happens is Naftali gets his dough . He 'll be on the pier with his hand out . " " Chrissakes , " Negus said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him peel off hundred-dollar bills like they was lempiras . I think he keeps it all in his hotel room , I swear . " Pablo was thinking of an old boy in a hotel room full of hundreddollarbills when he was startled once more by a sound on deck . He looked up and saw the outline of a man directly above him . It could only be Tino again . After a few moments , the man moved off aft . Pablo waited , too anxious to eavesdrop further , and then climbed silently out of the ice hold . He saw no one . For a while he leaned on the rail expecting to be challenged  --  but there was no further sign of Tino and he was reassured . He went down into the lazaret , found his gear in good order and climbed into his rack . Negus and the Callahans sat late in their paneled cabin while the Cloud ran on automatic . Tino was brewing coffee in the galley . " We getting ice and fuel from the Perreiras this time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , his bony arms folded on the table . Callahan sat across from him nursing a glass of soda water.  |p221His  lady reclined on a short sofa , her feet up , reading High Times . " I do n't think so , " Callahan said . " I think we 'll get grub and parts from the Perreiras , then after dark we 'll go over to Naftali 's outfit in Serrano . We can get fuel from him along with the goods . " " What 'll we tell Perreira ? " " We 'll tell him Naftali made us a better offer . He wo n't press it . He 's not aggressive . " " Always wondered how Naftali got away with running that operation , " Negus said . " You 'd think the Dutch would know it . Or the Americans . " " Maybe they do . Anyway it 's Naftali 's property , he owns it and he 's pretty fucking careful . Or else Mossad owns it and they 're super-careful . " Tino came down from the galley carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly to Negus in Papamiento . " You 're unhappy , " Callahan said to him . " I don ' like dat mon , " Tino said . " Pablo . " " Hell , I do n't like him neither , " Negus said . " But he ai n't supposedto be a nice fella . He 's our sonuvabitch . " " You approved him , Tino . You said you 'd ship with him . " " So I gon to , " Tino said . Callahan kept his eyes on the engineer . " You 're sort of off the whole enterprise , in my opinion . " Tino smiled sadly . " De ting can be done , capt'n . De money 's good . " " I think , " Negus said slowly , " that Tino 's concerned about the way things are being done lately . " " Meaning what ? " Callahan asked . " I ain ' sayin ' dat , Fred . You sayin ' dat , not me . " " Look , Jack , " Negus said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lax . You been drinking a lot , there 's that . You been drinking on the job , so to speak . The both of you been acting like there 's no tomorrow . I mean , the days are past when you can operate down here in a spirit of fun like . " " You can ask anybody around , Freddy , and they 'll tell you we 're the most professional , the most reliable vessel in the commerce . That 's always been true . " " It 's been true in the past , Jack . "  | " If we were n't good , Naftali would n't work with us . " Negus looked down at the tabletop . " I 'll tell you  --  sometimes I 'm surprised he still does . " " Well , " Callahan said , " you give me pause , Freddy . " " I 'm sorry , skipper , but there it is . Sometimes it feels like we 're just floating a party . " " We do like we 've always done , Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our confidence . " Negus was silent . Callahan reached across the table for the bottle and poured some rum into his soda . " Maybe you 're right about getting old for it . Could be it 's the beach for you , old stick . Maybe you should get back to that saloon in Hope Town . " " I just hope to see it again , " Negus said . " Nowadays , " Tino told them , " so many droguistas . A mon get killed quick . " " Young Pablo reminds me of a droguista , " Negus said after a while . " That 's what bothers me about him . " " He 's a Coast Guard deserter , " Callahan said . " Has n't been around long enough . " " Know who he reminds me of , " Negus said . " That dude we had the trouble with . . . you know . Ca n't even remember his damn name . " Deedee put her magazine aside . " Oh , dear , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tino said . Negus nodded in somber agreement . " Well , " Callahan said , " we dealt with it . I trust we wo n't have to do that to anybody again . However , " he said , " should the occasion arise . . . we wo n't be found lacking in resolve . " Freddy Negus stood up and walked to the hatch that led up to the galley . " It ai n't a matter of Pablo , Jack . It 's the whole thing . I mean , Tecan 's no milk run . Those Tees lay hands on us , we 've had the fucking drill . " He leaned in the hatchway for a moment and went back to his chair . " El Jefe 's got a lot of new technology . He 's got more boats and they 're faster . He 's got helicopters . The Yanks give him whatever he wants . They tell him what he wants . "  | " We 've always run the same risks , Fred . " " Damnit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tougher and more squared away . And you were . . . more responsible . " " Obviously , " Callahan said , " if you do n't have faith in me we ca n't operate . " " Fred 's been brooding , " Deedee said . " He 's been thinking about that albino dwarf El Jefe keeps . " Callahan sipped his drink . " Oh , " he said with a smile , " the one who chews people 's privates off . " Negus flushed . " There is such a creature , Jack , I hate to tell you . " " Snowflake , " Tino told them . " Copo . Das his name . " " Tecan is a mixture of the old and the new , " Deedee said . ' " Look , " Negus said , " there are times when the two of you act stark crazy . Now we gon na keep this damn boat right end up and do our business or what ? " " I 'll come through for you , Fred . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us or not ? " Tino nodded silently . " Of course I 'm with you , " Negus said . " Always have been . Just I get the feeling sometimes you 're flirting with disaster . " Callahan grinned with adolescent mischief and winked at his wife . " If it be now , ' t is not to come , " he declared . " If it be not to come , it will be now . If it be not now , yet it will come . The readiness isall . " " Ripeness , " Deedee Callahan said . " It 's readiness , Dee . " " I mean taking a risk is one thing , " Negus told them . " Fucking around for kicks is another . " " I like ripeness better , " Deedee said . " You like it , " Callahan said , " because it 's sexier . " With the air tank tucked into the gunwales under the bench on which he sat , Holliwell smoked and watched the green coastline  --  palm groves , banana plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy , the dive master , ran his thirty/six-footer at full throttle , slapping the hull over the placid water ; the bow took spray over the windward side that soaked the STP jacket Holliwell had worn against the sun . Sandy was a long , spare man with a freckled English countryman'sface darkened by the suns of Tecan and West Africa . He lounged in the stern , one loose hand over the stick , one elbow on the rail , leaning out to see the water ahead . His long black hair was bleached at the crown , parted at the middle of his skull like a **25;8595;TOOLONG peasant 's , and this with his sharp black eyes deep-set under thick low brows brought a kind of dervish flair , a Rasputin intensity , to his appearance . In the boat with Holliwell was a family of five Cuban-Americans from Miami . The father was stocky and muscular , his hair worn in a brush cut , his jaw jowled and pitted from relentless shaving . His wife was buxom and fleshy-faced yet with a long-legged trim frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were three boys between twelve and seventeen  --  the oldest vulpine with a nearly complete moustache and muscular like his father , the two younger quite like their mother ; over the waist of each of their bathing suits sagged a tube of buttery fat . The parents spoke to each other in Spanish , the boys in American Adolescent . All of them ignored Holliwell . " Could be seein ' turtle over this reef , " Sandy told the boys . " Good place to see dem . " " Aw-right , " said the middle boy with enthusiasm . " Would they bite you ? " asked the smallest boy . Sandy laughed . " Turtle bite you ? Turtle do n't bite you . Maybe take you for a ride . " " Hey , " the seventeen-year-old said , " I could go for that . " When the children 's parents spoke to Sandy it was in a formal and imperious way , as though they were used to service . Sandy answeredthem with deference . Three hundred yards offshore , Sandy killed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone looked over the side . The sky 's light sparkled back at them , reflected and refracted from the reef tops below  --  a long line of peaks curving out toward open ocean . Sandy gave them the dive plan . The current was southerly . Theyp225would dive straight out from the stern , up-current . Then they could follow a semicircle of reef tops , cross a sandy bottom and follow the edge of a drop back to the boat with the current behind them . There was black coral there , Sandy told them . The site was called Twixt by the people of the coast . Holliwell stared down at the liquid light of the white reefs . They were , after all , what he had come to see . He took a deep breath and put on his buoyancy compensator , his backpack tank , and bent to wrestle on his weight belt . Sandy put his own tank on with the ease of a man donning a sweater . The Cuban-American bustled about , tryingstays and buckles  --  the head of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going down . While Holliwellput his boots and fins on , Sandy checked out the gear of the younger of the two boys who were diving . " Ever see any sharks around here ? " the younger boy asked , as casually as he could . Holliwell admired his sangfroid . Testing his own regulator , he turned to watch Sandy answer . " No sharks here , " Sandy said simply . It turned out that the younger boy was diving with Sandy , the oldest with his father . It had been so ordered . " Want to come with us ? " the dive master asked Holliwell . " I 'll just follow along , " Holliwell said . " I 'll be all right . " He was not in fact a very experienced diver but the dive seemed easy enough . Holliwell went over last , carrying two five-pound weights , wearing trunks and a tee shirt to ease the shoulder straps on his sunburned back . On the jump-off , his mask filled almost to eye level ; he let the water rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he saw the reef tips rising around him , he cleared his mask and checked the depth gauge on his wrist . He was forty-five feet below the surface . He settled over a punch-bowl depression on the bottom ; his fin tips stirred the milk-white sand there . The visibility at this depth was marvelous  --  over a hundred feet , perhaps two hundred . Black and golden angelfish swarmed around him as though they expected to be fed . There were parrot fish and convict tangs in uncountable numbers . The reef descended in terraces from its highest peaks , from each terrace elkhorn coral stretched in tortured fantastical shapes between the domes of brain coral . Below him wrasse and groupers glided by , a boxfish watched him shyly from behind two prongs of elkhorn . Whenp226he paddled out from the plateau on which he had rested , two trumpet fish came along with him like scouts . He swam clear of the next terrace and let the weights take him deeper ; on the edge of vision he saw a barracuda  --  fairly small , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick off stragglers . When he leveled off , he was at sixty feet and the ocean floor still sloped downward under his fins . Far off and about forty feet above him he saw Sandy and the Cuban boy outlined against the shimmering curtain of the surface , swimming away from him . On the next terrace he saw the black coral . There seemed to be acres of it , dappled with encrusting yellow infant sponges , and circlingdown he felt as though he were flying over a lava ' field grown with daisies . When he was closer , he could see the coral 's root and branch patterns . It was sublime , he thought . He could feel his heart beating faster ; his blood coursed through him like a drug . The icy , fragile beauty was beyond the competency of any man 's hand , even beyond man 's imagining . Yet it seemed to him its perfection provokeda recognition . The recognition of what ? he wondered . A thing lost or forgotten . He followed the slope of the coral field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken so much pleasure in the living world . At about ninety feet , he confronted the drop . The last coral terracefell away and beyond it there was nothing , an immensity of shadowy blue , an abyss . He was losing color now . The coral on the canyon wall read blue-gray as he descended ; the wrasse , the butterflies , the parrot fish looked as dun as mackerel . A gray lobster scurriedalong the cliff . Enormous gray groupers approached to have a look at him . In a coral crevice , a spotted moray drew back at his approach , then put its head out to watch his bubble trail with flat venomous eyes . The surface became a mirage , a distant notion . He was at a hundred and ten and his pressure gauge , which had pointed twenty-five hundred p.s.i . at the jump-off , now read slightly under eight hundred . It was all right , he thought , the tank had no reserve and no J valve ; he would have enough to climb back as the pressure evened out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and he was unable to suppress the impulse to turn a somersault . He was at the borders of narcosis . It was time to startup.  |p227As  soon as he began to climb , he saw shimmers of reflected light flashing below his feet . In a moment , the flashes were everywhere  --  above and below . Blue glitters , lightning quick . The bodies of fish in flight . He began pumping a bit , climbing faster , but by the book , not outstripping his own bubble trail . Some fifty feet away , he caught clear sight of a school of bonito racing toward the shallows over the reef . Wherever he looked , he saw what appeared to be a shower of blue-gray arrows . And then it was as if the ocean itself had begun to tremble . The angels and wrasse , the parrots and tangs which had been passing lazily around him suddenly hung in place , without forward motion , quivering like mobile sculpture . Turning full circle , he saw the same shudder pass over all the living things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invisible shadow , a silence within a silence . On the edge of vision , he saw a school of redfish whirl left , then right , sound , then reverse , a red and white catherine wheel against the deep blue . It was a sight as mesmerizingas the wheeling of starlings over a spring pasture . Around him the fish held their places , fluttering , coiled for flight . Then Holliwell thought : It 's out there . Fear overcame him ; a chemical taste , a cold stone on the heart . He started up too fast , struggling to check his own panic . Follow the bubbles . Follow the bouncing ball . As he pedaled up the wall , he was acutely aware of being the only creature on the reef that moved with purpose . The thing out there must be feeling him , he thought , sensing the lateral vibrations of his climb , its dim primal brain registering disorder in his motion and making the calculation . Fear . Prey . He was running out of air  --  overbreathing and overtaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own desperate respirations furthered panic . When he had worked out a breathing pattern and reached the firstterrace , he found that he had enough to curve his ascent with theslope of the coral . At forty feet , he saw a sandy punch bowl like theone in which he had stopped but the forests of elkhorn were everywherethe same and the anchor line was nowhere in sight . Lookingup , he saw Sandy outlined against the surface , coming down at him . Sandy grabbed Holliwell 's pressure gauge , read it and shook his head in reproach . He pointed to the right and upward along the slope.  |p228Holliwell  followed the coral ridges as long as he could . The fish in the shallows swam placidly , unperturbed . When he found himself sucking hard on the regulator mouthpiece , he eased up the next thirty feet , taking three breaths on the way . And there , in another dimension altogether , the boat rocked gently , the youngest of the Cuban boys leaned over the side to watch the shifting surface , lost in reverie ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot blur of the beach , the line of banana jungle broken only by a white wooden building on a solitary hill , surmounted with a cross . Holliwell turned over on his back and swam to the boat 's ladder . The boy and his mother watched as he took off his gear . Before disconnecting the regulator from the tank he checked the gauge once more ; it read just a hair over empty at sea level . " That 's as empty as it gets , " he told the people in the boat . The charge of primary process he had experienced at a hundred and ten feet put him in danger of becoming garrulous . The boy looked at the gauge . " None left at all ? " " Empty , " Holliwell said . " Just like it says . " He was ill at ease with the boy and he sensed a certain artificiality in his own manner . His own children had not been this age for five years or more ; he had forgotten what it was like . Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? " the woman asked . " Just ran it out , " Holliwell told her cheerfully . " What did you see ? " the boy asked him . " Lots of great fish , " he said . " And beautiful black coral . " " And we ca n't take any , " the woman said . " Such a shame because it 's so beautiful . " " I 'm sure it looks prettier where it is , " Holliwell heard himself say pompously . The woman inflated her cheeks and shrugged . She was not a bad sort , Holliwell decided . They chatted for a few minutes . The family 's name was Paz ; they lived in Miami , had lived there since 1961 . All of their sons were born there . The man was a dentist , she herself was in real estate . They were visiting her brother , who had five hardware stores in Tecan . Holliwell told her that he was a professor ; she had lived in the States long enough to remain unimpressed . Sandy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboardp229and fixed a smirk on Holliwell . The dive master got out of harness in a single easy motion . " Now what you want down theah , mistuh ? " he asked Holliwell . He was smiling . " I nevah tol ' you go down theah . " " Just wanted a look , I guess . " " Sandy made him get out of the water , " the middle son announced . Senora Paz and the youngest boy gave Holliwell dutifully accusatory looks . Then Senora Paz asked sharply after her husband and eldest son . They were under the boat , Sandy assured her , playing among the elkhorn coral . After a few minutes , the dentist surfaced and climbed aboard . Hewas elated after his dive and his amiability extended even to Holliwell . " Where the hell were you ? " Dr. Paz asked Holliwell . " I nevereven saw you . " His English was almost completely unaccented . " Sandy made him get out of the water , " the middle son said . " Just down too deep , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air run out faster . " " What 's the attraction down there ? " the dentist asked . " Just the drop , " Holliwell said . " How far you think she drop off dere ? " Sandy asked him , laughing . " A long way , " Holliwell said . " Nine hundred meters , " Sandy said . " Is that possible ? " Holliwell said . Sandy let his smile fade . His nod was solemn , his eyes humorous with certainty . " I 'm tellin ' you , mon . Nine hundred meters . " When the youngest boy wanted to know how far that was in feet , Sandy was uncertain . " It 's about two thirds of a mile , " the dentist said . " I thought they taught you that in school . " " Yeah , dummy , " the middle son said to his brother . " How about that , " Holliwell said . Then the oldest boy surfaced with an empty tank . " Orca , orca , " the two younger boys shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were shining as he climbed up the ladder . It wasp230hard to dislike anyone , Holliwell thought , when you watched them come up from a dive . " Gosh , " the boy said to Holliwell , " we did n't see you anywhere . " " Sandy made him get ... " Senora Paz hushed her middle son with a frown and a raising of her chin . They motored back to the hotel dock making small talk . At the dive shack , Sandy , who knew a big tipper when he saw one , helped the Pazes wash and stow their gear and was jolly with the boys . Holliwell put his own gear away and sat down on the dock . After a while Sandy wandered down and joined him . " How long you been divin ' ? " Sandy asked him . " I 've been certified for two years . I do n't do it much anymore . " Sandy looked out to sea . " Lost a mon on dat drop other year . I follow him dom near two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' down . " " Suicide , " Holliwell said . " Das right . Mon take de sleepin ' pills and go down . " " It must have happened more than once . " Sandy nodded . " I don ' lose nobody , " he said . " Got to be dere own chosen will . " Holliwell felt himself shudder . " Did you think that 's what I was doing ? " " Oh , no , " the dive master said quickly . He touched Holliwell on the shoulder in the Caribbean way but avoided his eye . " I wo n't make the dive this afternoon , " Holliwell told him . " Maybe you could leave me off around French Harbor . I 'd like to snorkel down there . " Sandy guessed that it would be all right . French Harbor was on the way . He told Holliwell that if he requested it , the Paradise kitchen might pack a lunch for him . They walked together toward the hotel buildings . " There was something down that drop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . " Sandy stopped walking and looked at Holliwell , holding his hand on his brow to shield his eyes from the sun . " You see any shark ? " " No. "  | " Then don ' be sayin ' shark if you don ' see one . " " Something was happening down there . " " I tell you don ' go down that far , Mistuh Holliwell . I give you de dive plan . When you down so far , das not a good place . " " Why 's that ? " Sandy walked on ; Holliwell followed him . " Dat drop , people see tings , den dey don ' know what dey seen . Dey be frightened after . " " Was it always like that ? " " Jus ' dangerous divin ' , das all . Surface current and de drop is cunnin ' . You get deeper den you know . " " So pretty , though . " " Jus ' as pretty on de top , " Sandy said . " Always prettier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , of course . " Justin was trying to reread To the Finland Station in the afternoon shadows of the veranda . She had almost dozed off when she saw the man snorkeling along the southern end of Playa Tate . For days now , her dispensary had been ready to receive wounded insurrectionists ; each night she had spent awake and prowling in the light of her hurricane lamp among the stacks of stretchers , the basins and the small array of surgical instruments  --  listening to the government radio until it went off the air and then to U.S. Armed Forces radio or the BBC foreign service . Sometimes she would turn the volume down and tune in Radio Havana . Nights were long . It was high tide and the swimming man crossed over the inner reef and headed for the roadside beach in front of the mission steps . Only a few hundred yards past the steps , a sizable stream ran down from the foothills of the Sierra , carrying with it all the refuse and infections of the hillside barrios . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp that lived there grew to great size and Justin had often seen boats from the hotels up and down the coast come at night to gather them . Moreover , she knew that in the water offshore there was a deep channel where hammerhead sharks came in to feed upon the shrimp.  |p232The  man would be a tourist from one of the hotels . There would be many more before long as the fruit companies liquidated their unprofitable plantations and converted to the resort business . The swimmer 's absurd sportive presence irritated Justin considerably . If he persisted in staying near the channel , she would have to go down and wave him out of danger and she was not in the mood for personal engagement . To her further annoyance , the man came out of the water by the mission pier , took his fins off and sat down on it . Two women carrying laundry on their heads passed the pier and Justin felt as though she could see the false smile he gave them , hear his fatuous " Buenos dias . " While Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out on the veranda . " There 's someone on the dock , " he said to her . " A tourist . Snorkeling through . " " What do you think he wants ? " " He wants to sun himself on the glistening sands of Tecan . That 's what he paid for . " " But why on our dock ? " " Because he owns the place . Chrissakes , Charlie , go ask him . " She watched Egan make his way down the steps , slack-jawed , shuffle-gaited . His deterioration was proceeding at an alarming rate ; he had aged dreadfully in the past months , sometimes he seemed to her almost senile . Egan was talking to the tourist now ; the tourist had accepted a cigarette and a light from him . An odd pair they made  --  the tourist tanned and muscular , towering over the priest 's gray , lumpish figure . The two of them turned toward the mission building ; Egan was pointinginto the forest behind it . She stood up impatiently and went inside to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Godoy had said . Perhaps it was still . One time , she thought , they will require something from me other than my well-exercised reverent attention and prayerful expectation . People  --  men , when you came down to it  --  were always dreaming up glorious phantasmas for her to wait joyously upon . Justice . The life to come . The Revolution . There are limits , she thought . Justin Martyr.  |p233When  she went out with the coffee , Egan and the snorkeler were sitting on the pier in conversation . Well , she thought , why not , we 're all tourists now . For weeks no one had come . Campos had some method of keeping them away . After a few minutes , Father Egan came huffing up the steps . " Know who he is , that fellow ? He 's an anthropologist . He had business in the city and now he 's come to see our ruins . " " Yours and mine ? " " Haw , " Egan said . " Clever kid . " But Justin was growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him back and show him ? " " Yes , I did . And I asked him to dinner on Friday . " Justin looked at him in dismay . " Go down and un-ask him , " she said in a steely voice . " We ca n't have him here . " " We certainly can . " " We can not ! " Justin almost shouted . " May one ask why ? " She looked away , out to sea . " Good heavens , I suppose we can go to town and have dinner . I do n't understand what the objection is . Do you think I 'm so unpre-sentable ? " " It 's not that , " Justin said . Better to let it go , she thought . The chances were that the man would not come back . Or that Egan would forget . She watched the strange swimmer now , saw him sit waist deep in the water putting on his fins . He began to crawl toward deeper water . He was not far from the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom would slope sharply and without warning he would be over it . It was no place for a tourist to be  --  the sharks , and the bottom covered with sea urchins . A few feet short of the surge channel , she saw him crumple up and stop swimming . He was splashing , clutching his knee . Justin stood up . The tourist had crawled into the shallows and was lying in the slight surf , both hands folded over his wound . Damn you , she thought , you asshole tourist . " He 's hurt himself , " Father Egan said helplessly . " He stepped on a goddamn sea urchin is what he did . Either that or something took a piece of him . " She went into the dispensaryp234wing , snatching up a bucket on her way through the kitchen . In the bucket she poured a pint of ammonia and then diluted it with well water from the tap . She hauled the solution down the veranda steps and across the road to the water 's edge . The swimmer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he saw her , he was squinting in pain , his teeth clenched , pale under his tan . " Watch where you 're sitting , sir . There are sea urchins all around you . " The man turned on his side and eased toward her , feeling the way before him with his swim fin . She put out a hand and he took it in his , leaning his weight on her , dragging the injured leg . His mask was up on his forehead . Justin guided him out of the water and had a look at his leg . Sure enough , his left knee was swollen and purple with small spine ends visible through the skin . Justin poured some of the ammonia solution over his knee and rubbed it in with a cotton swab . " You can also piss on it , " Justin explained . " It 's not so easy to piss on your knee sitting down , " the man said . He was looking grateful and embarrassed . He was a tall well-built man ; his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But perhaps it was only the pain and his being a tourist . " I 'm really sorry to be trouble . Are you from the mission here ? " " Yep . " She took a hemostat from a kit and lifted a spine end offthe mottled flesh of his knee . " Hey , " she said , " I got the end out . " " I 'm sure you have more important things to do . " " Oh , stop it , " Justin said . She went after the second spine and pulled it out . " That 's gon na be sore for a while but the real bad pain will stop very soon . It 's nothing serious . " " I guess I was lucky . " " I guess you were . When you doubled up I thought a shark had hit you . " " A shark ? Right here ? " " There are sharks in the channel here . And a carpet of sea urchins . And the water 's polluted . It 's like a harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playa Tate then . " " You should , " she said . " This is a lousy place for it . " And what now ? He should be given an aspirin , put in the shade . He did not appear to be in shock . Nursey business for the tourists.  |p235She  helped him across the dirt road , sat him under a ceiba tree and went back up to her dispensary for aspirin . " Poor fellow , " Egan said as she passed through the kitchen to replace her bucket . " A nice chap . " " Yep , " she said . As she went down to him , two young loafers from town walked by along the road and paused briefly to mock him . He was indeed mockable , she thought , with his swim fins in his lap and the mask and snorkel still fitting on the front of his skull and his Day-Glo kneecaps . An absurd and unnecessary person . " Have an aspirin , " she said . " Have two . Forgot the water . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his face . In the scattered afternoon sunlight that shone through the great ceiba 's branches , she noticed that there were two identical and very nearly invisible scars on his right earlobe and that a small piece of the lobe itself was missing . " My name is Frank Holliwell , " the man said . " I was just talking with your Father Egan . " " Is that right ? " When the man 's ear was out of the sunlight the small scar disappeared . " How will you get back now ? " " The boat will pick me up . " He looked at the angle of the sun through the ceiba leaves . " They should be by anytime . " " You O.K. now ? " " I feel a lot better . " " Good . Take care now . " " I understand I 'm coming to dinner on Friday . " " No , I do n't think so , " Justin said , blushing . " I think Father Egan means to go into town with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " We 're in a state of disarray . We 're closing down soon . " There was something in the man 's affectless stare that made her uneasy . She glanced quickly at the scar , visible again in the sunlight . " They 'll have to get along without us . " " You 're a nun ? " " That 's right , " she said . He asked her what order she was and she told him . He went onnodding as though the Devotionists were familiar to him . Catholic . " They used to rap you on the knuckles , right ? " she asked lightly . " Not on my knuckles . I had Jesuits for that . "  | " Oh , I see . Well , that 's . . . classy . " " Are you coming to dinner with us too ? " he asked . She was startled by the manner in which he put it . It was as though he was flirting with her . What 's the world coming to ? she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Justin that she would relax a bit and speak earnestly and directly to a man and the man would think she was becoming flirtatious . It was annoying . It had something to do with the way she looked . " No , I ca n't , " she said . " I 've got a whole dispensary to pack . " " What 's it like being a nun these days ? " " Oh , " she said , " well , there are all kinds of nuns . " He is , she thought , he 's coming on . He probably ca n't help himself . That 's what that softness in his face is all about . " What 's it like for you ? " " It 's medieval , " she said , " And otherworldly . " She was pleased when he laughed , in spite of herself . " What 's that business on your ear , Mr. Holliwell ? " Put him on the defensive . The question seemed to surprise and embarrass him . " It 's a tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really ? Where ? " " Indonesia , " he said quickly . " Celebes . I 'm an anthropologist . " " And you were being one of the gang . " " Yes , " he said , " one of the bunch . I asked for their smallest size . " The buzz-saw whine of a large outboard sounded on the ocean ; they both turned to see the Paradise dive boat on its way to Playa Tate . " Well , " she said , " take care of your foot . Be thankful you knelt down on a baby one or we might have had to open up your leg to get the spines . " " Thanks , " he said . " And try to keep it clean . " " What ? " She laughed at him . " Your knee . " " Oh . . . yes . Look , maybe I 'll see you again . At the ruins or somewhere . I 'd like very much to talk . " " I 'll be pretty busy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at him and turned away . He was impertinent and patronizing and for all she knew , depraved . He was the kind of man she thought of as " cheesy . " But he was sort of nice . And not just a tourist , she thought ; Justin was innocently snobbish in the extreme . Back on the veranda , she felt a little high . The very recognition of her exhilaration was enough to depress her ; she was shortly guilty and ashamed . Air-headedness . Petty foolishness . The thought of waiting through another night was dreadful . But she would have to . She would have to go on believing in them . She leaned on the rail , gripping it until her knuckles were white . " Christ , it 's impossible , " she said . Egan was in the kitchen . Drunk . " Now , now , " he said . " There 's a good girl . " Pablo opened the hatch to dazzling sunlight and stepped out on the hot boards of the afterdeck , barefoot and shirtless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town of red-tiled roofs . The streets , unlike those of Palmas , were paved , the walls of the harborside buildingswere whitewashed . Over the port captain 's shed was a doublemastedflagstaff displaying a banner with a white cross on a stardappledblue field and the horizontal tricolor of Holland . Beyond the town was desert , grown with cactus and thorny acacia . Across a sparkling bay lined with limestone palisades , a low white peak rose like a cone of salt . The water lines were over ; Pablo picked up a hose and laved his head and face with a jet of fresh water . The water was good and cold . Spring water . Wiping it from his eyes , he saw Tino approaching . " Like to start d ' day wid some beer ? " Tino asked pleasantly . " You kidding me ? " Tino motioned him toward the rail . Stacked up on the dock were a dozen cases of Amstel beer . A yellow-haired Creole driving a forkliftwas lowering more beside it . " You go get ' em , sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pablo took his morning Benzedrine ; a barbed wave of resentmentp238ran through him . Fucking pull and tote . He climbed over the rail and took a closer look at the town . At the end of the pier was a market square dominated by a gabled stone building with " Perreira Brothers " lettered over its central doorway . To the right of it , behind a garden wall enclosing royal palms and banana trees , was a government building marked by the same two flags . Two seagoing tugs were berthed at the adjoining pier , one flying U.S. colors , the other Dutch . Beside the tugs were two small Venezuelanfreighters . As far as Pablo could see , there were no other craft in port . He lifted a crate of Amstel , carried it aboard and set it down beside the forward hold . After a while , he fell into the rhythm of hauling ; the speed , the sweating , the sun on his body made him feel powerful . When the beer was aboard , there were cartons of frozen meat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo shouldered a box past the shuttered main cabin , he heard the voices of the people conferring inside and although he could not make out what was being said there was something about the very tone in which they spoke that made him think of high fortuneand the big-time score . He began to take less pleasure in his donkey work and to feel turned around . After a little more than a half hour , he decided that he would take a break , let the cartons pile up on the pier for a while and get out of the sun . Tino was down in the engine space , working on the diesel . In the shade of a hatch cover , Pablo contemplated the scheme of things . He kept thinking of the old man called Naftali who was with them in the cabin now , and who lived in a hotel room amid piles of hundred-dollar bills . He had made his move , he thought . He had put a thousand miles between himself and the life of petty day-by-day . McPhail and his like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her ratburgers . He was out where it mattered ; out here , he thought , you made it big or you went under . He would go under or go back and let them put the irons on him and do the time . But if he made it big , he might go back and no one could touch him . Or he might settle down , on some island , a better island than this one  --  and be like the men you read about in Soldier of Fortune , men who had lived the life ofp239adventure in hot countries and by their strength and cunning made it big , gotten rich , and who lived exquisitely in plantation houses high above the harbor with beautiful native wives . People liked to get you thinking you were small-time . That way , they made out and you got fucked . It was that way now , he thought , they were in the cabin talking big-time scores and he was hauling groceries for them . They might pay him or they might not ; he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the fact was , they were old and soft . They were making it big , they had made their move , but they were soft . Callahan was a rummy . ' What were Negus and Callahan together compared to him ? Surely , he thought , their day was over . It was someone else 's turn now , someone smarter and tougher . And it was all in your mind ; if you let weak people buffalo you , they would keep you down . He had been letting them do it all his life and it was time to call them on it . He was young , he was strong , a soldier of fortune . He had seen them up close , they were nothing much . Naftali with the room full of money , he had not seen . But Naftali was an old man , was losing his grip . Was he as bad as all that ? He , Pablo , might see about that ; you had to take risks , there was nothing for free . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspect that things were going his way . Then Tino came up and yelled at him  --  the black son of a bitch actually cursed him out in front of the other niggers on the dock ; he was put back to his loading . As he labored under the bales of netting and the boxes full of spare parts , a chain of recall ground against his memory and every insult and humiliation he had ever been forced to bear flashed before him , as bright and hurtful as though he were enduring each again . ' When the last of the stores were aboard , he took another Benzedrineand shortly thereafter made up his mind . They would never pay him , he realized . They took him for a fool . It was time for another move . A man does n't live forever , he thought . You do n't make out playing it safe . He had tried being Joe Citizen and he had ended up sharing a trailer with an ignorant whore and a kid he could n't support . No more . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like everybody . In the afternoon , Tino sent him to the port captain 's office to getp240the Cloud 's papers stamped and the fishing permit renewed . By the time he got back aboard , the conference was over . The cabin shutters were lifted and Naftali had departed unseen . The Callahans were in bathing suits . Pablo asked if he could take a shower . " Go ahead , " Callahan told him . " We 're finished here . " Callahan looked pretty good , Pablo thought , harder and trimmer than he ought considering his age and the amount he seemed to drink . The sight of Mrs. Callahan in her bikini stirred Pablo 's resentment and strengthened his resolve . He noticed that Negus had started in drinking beer . " We 're going to the beach , " Deedee said . " Up at the new hotel . Anybody else want to come ? " Pablo shook his head . " Tino , " she said , " you come . I want to see if you 'll show your legs . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't think he can swim , " she said to her husband . " I de bes ' swimmer , " Tino told her with a sad smile . " You 'll find Naftali at the Hollandia if you need him , " Callahan told Negus . " He 'll probably sack out , I do n't think he 's feeling well . " He looked over his men with an air of good-natured proprietorship . " Think you boys can stay out of trouble until we get back ? " As he asked the question , Pablo noticed that a gear locker beside the galley was swinging open . Its upper drawer was piled with tubes and radio parts  --  various things that might be worth keeping under lock and key in port . His automatic pistol was in the lower drawer still in its leather holster . On the locker handle hung an open padlock . " Guess I 'll wash up now , " Pablo said . He went back to the lazaret to get his towel and clogs and some clean underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind to cool it ; the boards enclosed each hour of the day 's heat . When he had finished showering , the locker still hung open . He changed clothes on deck , leaving his boots beside the hatch with his wallet and passport under his socks , and put on his sunglasses and his Macklin Chain Saw hat . With the cap down over his eyes , he sat down in one of the cockpit chairs , turning it round on its swivel so that he could face the main cabin and see the open locker.  |p241In  the cabin , Negus reclined on a wooden bench , his feet up on the table and his back against the bulkhead . He had been up all night and had started drinking in the morning . There was a glass of neat rum on the table , a few inches from where his legs rested . Tino was in the engine space with another St. Joostian , working on the Lister . Through the planking , Pablo could hear the rattle of their tools and their soft curses . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was waiting for Negus to fall asleep . As he willed Freddy Negus into slumber , he had a look at the publications stacked beside the Modar . He found two U.S. Coast Guard code books , laminated and stamped " Secret , " and the Coast Guard frequency chart , all current . Along with these were code books of the Tecanecan and Compostelan navies , so similar in typeface and binding to the U.S. books that it was apparent they had been printed by the same outfit . The Spanish in these was obscure to Pablo , but the military frequencies and codes were listed . ' When he heard Negus begin to snore , he put the books down quietly and stood up and walked barefoot into the galley . Negus was asleep down in the main cabin , not ten feet away from him , his head resting on a lintel in the paneling , his mouth open . Pablo waited a moment with his eyes on Negus ' drawn face and listened to Tino and his mate work in the engine space . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching Negus , he reached into the lower drawer of the open locker and drew out his holstered pistol . Pistol and holster in hand , he backed off silently to the cockpit and furiouslyset about getting himself in harness . Negus was still snoring when he finished , Tino still tapping away on the Lister with his assistant . With shirttails over his trouser tops , Pablo walked out on deck , picked up his boots and sat down on the edge of the after hatch . He put his passport and wallet in his pocket and casually put on his socks and cowboy boots . He made himself wait for a moment , then climbed over the rail and walked slowly along the cement dock toward town . There was still no one in sight aboard the Cloud . On his way to the market square , he could not resist touching the pistol under his arm . When the slant of the sun lit the cockpit windows to a greentintedblaze and the sunlight crept across the galley and the cabinp242below it , Negus woke up and held his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , shuddered and went out on deck shielding his eyes . He found the water hose beside the after hatch , turned the pressure on and held it over his head and drank from it . Tino , in a grease-spatteredpurple tank-top shirt , came up and took the hose from him . " Where 's the kid ? " Negus asked him as he drank . Tino rolled the water in his mouth and spat it out on the deck . " He not with you ? " They looked at each other and stalked around the boat in search of Pablo . Negus called his name . They checked the lazaret and looked through his gear . " The fucker flew , " Negus said . " Lef ' his gear . " " I did n't see his passport there . " They went into the galley and leaned against the stove . Negus rubbed his eyes . " Maybe he won ' come back , " Tino said . " Took his piece out of here , " Negus said , slamming the gear locker shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fin ' him , " Tino said . " No place he can go I won ' fin ' him . Not on dis eye-land . " " O.K. , " Freddy Negus said . " Wan ' me to bring him back ? " " Find out what the hell he 's up to and let me know . We 'll figure it from there . " " Ya , " Tino said . Negus watched him walk briskly down the cement pier . As he went , two young islanders who had been sitting on a piling stood up and fell into step with him . Holliwell finished his rum , thought about having another and decided on it . He poured it quickly and guiltily ; he was drinking as he had not done for years and still smoking . Propped in a wicker chair on the porch of his Paradise bungalow , his feet on the pastel rail , he looked out over the layered ocean . Raw rum drained the disease of his mind . His thoughts werep243focused by an act of will on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly the cool sure-handed motion with which she had guided him from the surf . The lightest of touches , a gesture almost , but she had put all her strength behind it . For a few seconds she had supported him . Curious . Indicative of what ? Trust . Confidence . An insolent assurance , an unthinking self-superiority that was wonderful to see . A nun . Thinking of her made him laugh . In his solitary laughter there was admiration , contempt and jealousy . It was very beguiling , that female arrogance . There were women who could not refrain in their dealings with men from intimating that it was they who were more at home in the world . Who could not forbear , all unprovoked , to run up their mythic pennants . Instrument of Birth . Shroud Weaver . Bent never Broken . It became very primitivevery quickly . Talking some commonplace like genocide or the weather they performed a hula , a series of mudras . Your eyes are hot and deluded , they signaled , ours are clear . We have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured . We can look on all things the same , we can imagine serenity . Grow up , they said . The responses were various and complex but all involved equally primitive rage . Snatch ! Stuff , cooze , undoing , unclean . Go bathe yourselves and be suitable for our fantasies . And you ca n't hear the sound of our Bull Roarer ! He took more rum and filled his glass with warm Popi-Limon . The ice in the bar bucket had melted . He liked her , it was that simple . He could say anything he liked or nothing at all and the spooks and hirelings could report anything that he said and it would make no difference . He felt sure enough of that . Was she then at home in the world  --  the modern world , like the Jew in Nolan 's strange arrested hypothesis ? She seemed to think she was . The question would not have occurred to her . He would put it to her ; that was in his line , after all . Who do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One way or another it must seem possible to her that the world could be ordered to suit her scruples and inhabited with satisfaction . In the name of God or Humanity or some Larger Notion  --  a newp244order of ages with a top and a bottom and sides . Right consequences following right actions . A marvelous view of the world , he thought . If it prevailed it would produce its own art forms , its own architecture , its own diet . In Saigon , he had once smoked opium with a young officer of airborne troops who had described himself as a winner . " If you opposeme , " the young officer had explained , " I will win . You will lose . " " Always ? " Holliwell had asked . Every time , the officer had explained . Because the compulsion to lose was universal and only a handful of people could overcome it . Holliwell had ventured the opinion that it must be very strange to approach every contest with the certainty of success . The officer was an unimposing man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come to be in the Army at all . " ' What I think is strange , " he had said , " is approaching them knowing you 're going to lose . " Saying it , he had fixed Holliwell with a look of unsound satisfaction . The eyes behind the lenses were knowing and tolerant and demented , but the point was well taken and he had scored a success ad hominem in that very moment . Positive thinkers . How could they ? he wondered . How could they convince themselvesthat in this whirling tidal pool of existence , providence was sending them a message ? Seeing visions , hearing voices , their eyes awash in their own juice  --  living on their own and borrowed hallucinations , banners , songs , kiddie art posters , phantom worship . The lines of bayonets , the marching rhythms , incense or torches , chanting , flights of doves  --  it was hypnosis . And they were the vampires . The world paid in blood for their articulate delusions , but it was all right because for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consciences on automatic . They were beyond good and evil in five easy y steps  --  it had to be O.K. because it was them after all . It was good old us , Those ' Who Are , Those Who See , the gang . Inevitablythey grew bored with being contradicted . Inevitably they discovered the fundamental act of communication , they discovered murder . Murder was salutary , it provided reinforcement when they felt impotentor unworthy . It was something real , it made them folks and thep245reference to death reminded everyone that time was short and there could be no crapping around . For the less forceful , the acceptance of murder was enough . Unhappy professors , hyperthyroid clerics , and flower children could learn the Gauleiter 's smirk . The acceptance showed that they were realists which showed that they were real . Rum was making his poisoned leg throb . There was no reason to get angry . At his age one took things as they were . Despair was also a foolish indulgence , less lethal than vain faith but demeaning . One could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to believe in oneself . Very , very difficult . One was a series of spasms , flashes . Without consistency , protean , infantile  --  butone would have to do . The loneliness was hard . In the greening twilight , he thought of the great silence that had settled on the reef . The fear and the muted coral colors hung in his recollection like fragments of collective memory , a primordial dream . Closing his eyes , he could hear again the rhythm of his breathing and feel the panic drugs surging in his blood . He had no business down there . Three men carrying firewood came down the road , their bent figures outlined against the aqua and scarlet horizon . Approaching the Paradise grounds they turned off to follow the shore where their passage and their burdens would not worry the nerves of sensitive guests . It was a diorama of toil and poverty , and Holliwell , in his easy chair , felt suitably guilty . B. Traven  --  but they were all south of cliche , so it was simple reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always felt different depending on your health , your state of mind and the time of day ; sitting in a resort watching the peons was always the same for people whose education prepared them to do it properly ; the final emotion was self-pity . He had no business under the reef . Nor had he any business where he was , under that perfumed sky . He reminded himself that he had his business like everyone else . It was as real as anyone else 's and so was he . His business was done in University Park , a perfectly real place though recently constructed . It was to husband and father , to teach , even to inspire , and to endure . These things were not trivial . A monstrous pride might despise them , but honor could not . Because who does one think one is ?  |p246At  times one has only a slender notion . One is only out here in this , whatever it is . Whirl . People disappeared and were said to have died , as in war . Or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking the wrong lines . Some disappeared in place , their skulls hollowed out by corrosive spirits or devoured by parasites . The world and the stations of men changed ruthlessly ; the funhousebarrel turned without slowing . The fall of last week 's airplane sends amazed salesmen down the ledge . The coral polyps and sawfish receive a dry rain . In suburban shopping centers the first chordates walk the pavement , marvels of mimesis . Their exoskeletons exactly duplicate the dominant species . Behind their soft octopus eyes  --  rudimentaryswim bladders and stiletto teeth . Just out here . Each one alone . The rest is fantasy . It had been to consider too curiously to consider so . As the stars came out , fear broke over his heart like a dawn of unwholesome colors . Rags in the wind , the taste of a tannery . It was a childhood image . He drank more but the rum did n't do it . That 's what you get , he thought . In the last hours of afternoon , Pablo sat pacing himself in the E Wowo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , he hit the street ; he felt himself an instrument of stealth and strength . He followed the palm-topped wall of the Governor 's Palace , grim , almost angry . Naftali 's Hollandia Hotel was two blocks beyond the palace on the far side of the street . Pablo sauntered across , strung tight and trying to loosen it down . Trying to ease it , cool it . The Hollandia was no more than a two-story stone house with a little garden behind its pastel gate . Four tiled steps led up to its veranda . Pablo mounted them quickly and went inside . The foyer was deserted , the cubicle-sized desk unattended . In a curtained room behind it , someone was watching television , a comedy with music , in Spanish from the Caracas station . No one came out when Pablo went upstairs.  |p247The  second-floor corridor smelled of varnish and insecticide . At the far end of it a loosely fitted shutter creaked in the gentle wind and lightly battered the window casing . The sound covered Pablo 's soft steps as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and it was at the windowed end of the passage , above the room numbered eight . Across the hall was a water cooler with a plastic glass resting on it . As he passed the cooler , Pablo glanced back over his shoulder toward the stairs , then placed himself beside the door to room eight . He was disturbed to hear voices sounding from inside , speaking some foreign language he had never heard before . Dutch maybe . But after he had listened for a while , he determined that there was only one voice , a single speaker . The voice sounded vacant and slurred , like that of a drunk man talking to himself . Well , well , thought Pablo . You put yourself away a little early , my friend . He went to the cooler and silently filled the plastic glass . Then he crouched down outside the door and began to pour the contents of the glass underneath it . The door opened at the first spout . Standing above Pablo was a hawk-faced man in a blue bathrobe and carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Pablo 's throat . The hand holding the gun was unsteady but purposeful . Pablo set his plastic glass down and rested on one knee , a genuflection . " What 's this , sailor , " the hawk-faced man inquired , " the wine of astonishment ? " When the old man leaned down to take Pablo 's weapon from beneath his open shirt , Pablo realized how unsteady the man 's hand actually was . Had he not been thrown so off balance himself , he might have tried a move . But he had lost for the moment . The sclerotic nature of the old man 's movements both frightened and encouraged him . " Come visit , " the man said to Pablo . " I been expecting you all night . " " Not me , " Pablo said , blinking under the shaded light of the room . " We both got the wrong people . See , I was playing a joke on a friend of mine . " " Aha , " the man with the gun said . " Funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now just take it easy ! " " Tell me something . How easy you want me to take it ? " He motioned Pablo deeper into the room . It was a room that was clean and without character , unclaimed by its occupant , everything the management 's . " In my former organization when funny people poured water under our doors we would blow the door apart . " " Hey , man . . . honest to Christ ! " " If I would have done that it would have been your blood I 'd see coming under my door . But I 'd wait before I put my head out , believe me . " " It 's a mistake is all , see . " The man carefully seated himself on the side of his bed ; he was half turned away from Pablo . " I saw you on the boat today . You stank all over the dock of petty thief . " Naftali was inspecting the serial number on the stock of Pablo 's service forty-five . " But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd meet again . " He had put his own gun down on the bed to look at Pablo 's . " This is U.S. government property , no ? " Naftali asked . He removed the clip from Pablo 's gun , set it down and picked up his own automatic . Leaning back on the bolsters , he held the gun on his lap . " That 's right , " Pablo said . " And you . . . whose property are you ? " Pablo made him no answer . " ' Well , you 're too late , thief . " Naftali took a piece of paper from his bathrobe pocket , wadded and threw it toward Pablo . What Pablo picked up and read was a bank receipt for the transfer of gulden three hundred eighty thousand to the Amsterdam branch of the NederlandseAlgemeen Bank . The account to which the money was consignedwas held in the name of a M. Blanc , a resident of Brussels , Belgium . " Know what it means , boychick ? " " I believe I know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die for nothing , thief . It means the money 's gone . " " What are you gon na do ? " " You know what 's customary ? " Naftali asked  |p249Pablo  took a deep breath and glanced at the door . It looked very far away . ' When he turned back to face Naftali he noticed for the first time the night table beside the old man 's bed . The table was covered with bottles  --  one of Mexican brandy , another of liquid Nembutal , clearly labeled in English , yet another small one of insulin with a syringe beside it . " I wo n't ask you for a break , " Pablo said . " It never hurts to ask . " Pablo turned away from the sight of the barrel . " Fuck you , " he said . " Nothing to say for yourself ? A name ? " " Pablo , " Pablo said . " Whose life is worth more , Pablo ? Yours or mine ? " Tabor looked with hatred into the man 's cold gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of games . " I 'm gon na walk outa here , " he told the man on the bed . " You can do what you like . " " That 's right , " Naftali told him . " I 'm entitled . " Pablo stayed where he was . " Tonight I indulge my every whim , why not ? " Confused and frightened , Pablo bared his teeth and tried to shrug . The man seemed extremely drunk . Or drugged . Yet his movements were deliberate . He was crazy , Pablo decided , and sick . His eyes werered-rimmed , he was pale and sweating . Sick to death , Pablo thought . " Please , " Tabor said . He knew it was a terrible thing to say . " I think I waited for you , " Naftali said . " The thief always comes . " Pablo panicked , coiled himself to spring and almost lost his balance . He was too frightened . " You embarrass me , " the old man said . Yet he was not so old , Pablo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm dying . " Tabor could only stand and stare , taking each breath as it came . " Do you understand , Pablo ? " Pablo slowly shook his head . Naftali smiled coldly . " You are interrupting my suicide . " Tabor 's mouth fell open . " It 's terrible , " Naftali said . " A coarse intrusion at a solemn moment . What a rude fellow you are . "  | " I . . . I . . . do n't know what to tell you , " Pablo stammered . " I made a mistake . " " Definitely . " " I made a big mistake , " Pablo Tabor admitted . " But I ai n't gon na crawl , mister . Whatever happens gon na happen . " Naftali laughed and his eyes closed for a moment and Pablo considered a bolt for the door . The predatory eyes were on him before he could compose a move . " You 're young , Pablo . " Tabor swallowed . " Have a drink , " Naftali said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night table and tossed it to Pablo . Catching it , Pablo held it by his chest for a moment , then took it in his right hand . He licked his lips . He was preparing to throw it in the man 's face . " Do n't even think about it , " Naftali warned him . " I want to see you drink . " Pablo stared at the bottle . " No , " he told Naftali . " No way . " " Think it 's poisoned ? " Naftali laughed again . " That would be funny , eh ? I could go to eternity with a little thief at my feet . A Viking funeral . Do n't worry , " the old man said . " It 's not the best brandy but it wo n't kill you . " Pablo took a sip and gently put the bottle on the foot of the bed . " Sit , " Naftali ordered him . He went across the room to a straightbackedchair and sat down with his head in his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naftali said . " I 'm sorry , " Pablo said . " I 'm awful sorry . Lemme go , will ya ? " Naftali shook his head solemnly . " An extrovert to the last , that 's me , Pablo . But I 'm a good listenertoo . Since you 're here , we 'll chat . But it must be about important things . Time is short . " Pablo started to speak , to plead . The barrel of the pistol was still trained on him . He put his hand over his eyes . " I 'm a thief like you , " Naftali said . " An older and much better thief . Smarter . If I were not a thief  --  who knows what I 'd be . A geologist . An opera singer maybe . A baritone . Scarpia . " Still pointing the gun at Pablo , he leaned forward and took the brandy from beside his slippered feet . " Truthfully , " he told Tabor , " I think I would be ap251pianist , strange as it seems . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a thief what would you be ? " " The thing is , " Pablo said , " I 'm not a thief at all . " " Answer seriously . " " Shit , man , I do n't know . Look , if you 're gon na be easy about this , would you mind if I just left ? " " I would mind , " Naftali said . " Now answer . " " I got no idea in hell . " " Try harder . " " I suppose I 'd be a lifer in the Coast Guard . " " Harder . " " I 'd do things different . " Then to his own surprise he said : " Maybe I 'd be a better father . " " Ah , " Naftali said . " Now you 're talking . Father to whom ? " " You want to know my story do you , mister ? " " I do . In your own words . " " I got a little boy . Nine . I was just wishin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here . " " Then why do you have to be a thief ? " " Because I got turned around . Just turned around and around . " " Yes . Me also . What turned you around ? " " What did ? Things did , is what . Things . " Naftali took the bottle of liquid Nembutal in his hand and drank from it . He followed the drink with brandy , which he swallowed without blinking , his eyes still on Pablo 's . " Things , " he said . " Life ? History ? " " Sure , " Pablo said . " If you like . " A small wind chime tinkled against the closed shutter on the window . Naftali turned toward it . Pablo saw that his hand was still around the pistol . " The last time I saw my father , " the old man said , " he was standing on a piano stool . He was showing our visitors that there was no jewelry concealed in the light fixture . It was in a faraway country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only pajamas and I had never  --  although I was already a graduate  --  I had never seen him in pajamas before . And my mother stood beside the stool and her hand was raised because she was afraid he would fall . I was there . I was also afraid . I was n't Naftali then . " Pablo frowned . He could make no sense of it.  | " Did they find any jewelry ? " he asked after a moment . " No jewelry . But in the stool there were some nocturnes of Chopin . Manuscripts in his hand . Right in the stool . So typical of my father . " " Huh , " Pablo said . " Did they find them ? " " Oh yes , they found them . They came back for them . And for my parents and my sisters also . But I was gone . " He picked up the brandy bottle and tossed it to Pablo . Pablo took a long drink . Naftali was listening to the wind chime . " Hey , that 's tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " Happened a million times . Always has . Continues . History . History will turn you around every time , sailor . " " Well , " Pablo said . " I hope you got your own back off the bas-tards . " Propped on one elbow against the bolster , Naftali shrugged . " I had revenge . It was n't enough . " He turned toward the shutteredwindow again and the breeze drifting through stirred his sparsehair . " You ca n't get your own back . " Naftali 's eyes were dulled . Pablo began to think he might come out all right . " I keep remembering trains , Pablo . The last trains . Little gymnasiasweethearts waiting on platforms . Their parents waiting for them . And I alone am escaped to tell thee . " " What I do n't understand , " Pablo said , " is how come when you got all that money you 're gon na throw it away . " " If you lived long enough , you might understand , " Naftali said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster ; his hand , holding the pistol , rested at his side . " Know what Nietzsche tells us ? He tells us that the thought of suicide helps bring a man through many a long hard night . Well , I 'm grateful to Nietzsche for that observation  --  but , danke schon , no more nights . " Another breeze licked at the wind chime . " All that bread , man  --  that could buy you a couple of good ones . " " You can buy lots of fancy nights . But you ca n't buy morning . Try sometime and buy yourself a short night for money , you 'll see what I mean . "  |p253Talking  was the thing , Pablo thought . " I could n't be that negative , " he said . " The way I see it , if money do n't mean nothing then nothing does . " " I know the value of everything , " Naftali said . " I 've stolen it all and I 've sold it all . " " Life is life . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A little cinder in the wind , Pablo  --  that 's what you are . You 're telling me  --  who set such store on my survival  --  that life is life ? " " It 's me gon na be alive in the morning , " Pablo said . He hoped it had not been rash of him . " What for ? " " What for ? Well . . . to keep it rolling , I guess . " " To keep it rolling , " Naftali repeated . " To make the world goround . Maybe it goes better without you  --  what about that ? " Pablo watched him warily . The man seemed balanced on the edgeof consciousness but his falcon 's gaze was still sharp enough . " I never thought of it that way , " Pablo said . " Try it . " " Are you gon na let me go ? " Pablo asked . " I had three wives , " Naftali said . " Each one was an idealist . All went to prison . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of a prison . " " You been lucky . " " Why should I let you go ? " Naftali demanded . He pulled himself upright in a sudden spasm of passion . " What are you worth ? Explain yourself . " " Everybody 's worth something , " Pablo said . " I mean  --  everybody'slife got some meaning to it . You know  --  there 's a reason for people . " " No kidding ? A reason for you ? What is it ? " " I do n't know , " Pablo confessed . " I ai n't found out yet . But I know there is one . " " But you 're vicious and stupid , are you not ? " " No ! " Pablo said hotly . He was shocked and enraged . " Of course not ! " Naftali 's eyes went out of focus for a moment . His gaze wandered . Pablo tensed . " I could have put an end to everything with this , " the old manp254said , lifting his pistol . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow . I want to remember . Can you believe it ? I wanted to remember everything . " " I believe it , " Pablo said . He felt himself under Naftali 's cold scrutiny again . " You 're a very stupid young man , " Naftali told him . " I tell you this for your own good because you need to know it . " " Can I have a drink ? " Pablo asked . Naftali let him come forward and take the bottle off the bed . " When you 're dead in some gutter for a dime , what happens to your son ? It was you with the son , yes ? " " Yeah , " Pablo said . " It was me . " " What happens to him ? He becomes a thief like his father ? Or what ? " Pablo put the brandy back on Naftali 's bed . " You really give a shit ? " " Tell me . " " He wo n't be nothing like me , " Pablo said . " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the breeze again . The wind chime sounded . " You wo n't get to sniff that wind where you 're going , " Pablo told him . " I leave you the wind , " Naftali said . " Are n't you scared ? " " Of what should I be scared ? Of devils ? " Pablo was impressed . " You got a real heavy rep around this ocean , Naftali . I guess you know that . " " I got a heavy rep all over , " Naftali agreed . " For my avarice and my readiness to kill . " " Listen , " Pablo hastened to say , " I appreciate your been ' easy about this . I would n't blame you if . . . " Naftali 's smile stopped him . A hard , bad smile , he thought . A dead smile . He froze in his chair . " Revenge is not enough , " Naftali said . " I know . " The smile faded and the hardness left his eyes . " Not revenge . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we like , Pablo , you and me . They 're not enough . " " Easy for you to say , pal . You 've had all those things . " " Not enough . "  | " Well , hell . What 's enough then ? " " I am not the man to ask , young sir . I can only tell you what is not . " Pablo began to rise from the chair but Naftali raised the gun and waved him back down . He took more Nembutal , then brandy , and rolled the bottle to Pablo . " Drink . " Pablo had another pull and eased back in the chair . " Trains , " Naftali and softly . Pablo saw with embarrassment that he was crying . " I sure did come to rip you off , Naftali . Sorry I picked tonight . " " Thank your lucky stars you picked tonight , " Naftali said . He kept the gun pointed at Pablo ; his left hand was groping under the bolster . It came up a clenched fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm dead . Tell them you saw me . That there 's no mistake . " Pablo nodded . Naftali extended his closed left hand and opened it under Pablo 's eyes . In the colorless palm was a small bright stone ; it took Pablo a few seconds to realize that the stone was a diamond . " Take it , " Naftali said . His voice was empty of intonation , running down . Pablo looked at the stone , then at Naftali . " You 're giving me this ? " " I 'm giving . Take it . " It was the biggest diamond Pablo had ever seen , although he had not seen many . It appeared to be five times the size of the one in his wife 's wedding ring and he had still been paying for that one when he went over the hill . " Goddamn , " he said . " I do n't want them to get it here , " Naftali said . " Goddamn , " Pablo said . " You 're all right , boss , no shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want you searching my room afterwards . It has . . . bad associations for me . " Smiling like a child , Pablo feasted his eyes on the diamond . " Since I was young , " Naftali told him , " I have n't given anything to anyone . Now there 's no one but you and it costs me nothing . So take it , thief . Give it to the son you talk about and tell him . . . " He broke off in a massive yawn that seemed to exhaust him . " Or keep it and lie . Do what your nature compels. "  | " What do you want me to tell him , boss ? " " There is a creature in another dimension whose jewelry is dead worlds . When this creature requires more of them it plants the seed of life on a tiny planet . After a while there are people and then nothing  --  a patina . " " You want me to tell him that ? " The pistol fell from Naftali 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The thief always comes , " Naftali said . " Were n't you told by your mother ? " " Not by my mother , no . " " Yes , " Naftali said . " Always . " The old man 's eyes began to roll backward in their sockets . He said something too faintly for Pablo to hear . " Es ist eine schone . . . " Naftali whispered . " Ach . Trains . " Pablo leaned against the brass frame of the bed and bent down to hear . " Brain coral , " Naftali whispered to him . " It 's only the outer coral of the brain ... " Tabor took the brandy bottle and sat down on the edge of the bed . He dropped Naftali 's diamond into the breast pocket of his shirt . " Pablo ! " " Yo , " Pablo answered . " There are reefs outside , Pablo . And reefs inside  --  within the brain of the diver . " " I do n't understand you , boss , " Pablo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's presence . But he had scored in spite of everything . Had made an idiotic overplay and scored all the same . He felt forgiven , favored by God . " In the brain coral you see the skull of the earth , the heaping of the dead . You pass it going out . . . you see it in your mind . . . it 's your own brain . Sometimes among the brain coral . . . the casing of a skull . It rolls under the reefs . " Pablo stood up , lifted the shutter slats and looked out into the quiet street . He saw no one save an elderly Chinese in a Hawaiian shirt , walking his bicycle along the sidewalk . He turned and put thep257brandy bottle on the dresser , catching sight of his own lean brown face in the mirror as he did so . " Pablo ! " " Still with you , boss . " " Your name rolls , Pablo . It 's your skull down there  --  white and round . It shines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral . Your skull is the counter . . . it 's the only ball in this game , Pablo . " He cursed me , Pablo thought , he turned around and cursed me . The chill of eight fathoms touched his heart . A dying man 's curse . Might it be , he wondered , that a man saw the future as he went out ? " Hey , man ! " He shook Naftali 's shoulder , lightly at first , then harder , trying to bring him back in over the reef . But Naftali 's breathing was like the slow droning of some remote insensible machine , beyond call . He stepped back and looked around the room , fingering the bottom of his shirt pocket where the diamond was . It was still possible , he thought , that there was more jewelry somewhere in the room . If there were even one more stone like the one in his pocket , he might buy time and freedom . If there were two or three more . . . the excitement made him clench his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he reached down to take his clip and gun from beside Naftali 's unconscious body another thought came to him : that it might still be possible to bring the old man back , to get help , a doctor , an ambulance . But it was too late for that . There was too much to explain , too many forces at work . It would be a foolish gesture . Naftali 's pistol was a good one  --  Japanese , a new Nambu , eight shots , seven sixty-five . Pablo set about searching the drawers and paper wardrobes . In one drawer , he found a wall crucifix . The other drawers held invoices , onionskin copies of contracts , letters typed in several languages , some in a strange alphabet he had never seen before . Only one was locked and when Pablo pried it open he found a stack of nearly a dozen passports from as many countries . The wardrobes held a few pairs of slacks and a great many short-sleeved white shirts . He searched no further ; he felt very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down in the chair for a few minutes and drank the rest of the brandy , listening to the wind chime and Naftali 's last labored breathing . What , Pablo wondered , might he be seeing now ? The speculation threw him into a sudden panic . He 's too strong , Pablo thought desperately , he 'll take me with him . Tabor got to his feet , hesitated for a moment and then went quickly to the bed and slid the bolster from under Naftali 's head . Staring hard at the colorless stucco wall before him , he pressed the bolster with all his strength into Naftali 's face . There was a brief spasm of faint struggle , so faint that he might almost have imagined it . When he had finished , he dropped the bolster and wiped the sweat from his eyes . He could not bring himself to feel for the old man 's heart . Before turning out the light , he glanced quickly at the figure on the bed . Naftali 's gray eyes were dull , there was spittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reefs he lay . Alone in the darkened room , he felt bereaved . He would interpret Naftali 's words not as a curse , nor as a prophecy , but as a warning from the dead worlds . He besought Naftali 's forgiveness . When he passed the open drawer where the crucifix lay , he crossed himself as he had seen Mexicans do . What now , old man ? he thought , touching the diamond . There was nothing to do but go back to the Cloud . The lower floor of the Hollandia was silent and dark now ; its street door had been bolted . Pablo laid back the latch carefully . Outside , the island town seemed to have withdrawn into itself . He could hear only a distant car engine , a few dogs , the calls of the night birds that had tormented him in Compostela . He went down the front steps and out through the little garden fence and it was not until he had crossed the street and started down the neat little alley leading to the marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that was parked some distance down the road from the Hollandia , and that there was a man seated behind the wheel . The Hollandia'snight light reflected on what might be the man 's sunglasses or the visor of a driver 's cap . Aboard the Cloud , the Callahans were making merry in their saloon deck ; Negus was on the bridge moodily tapering off on beer.  | " Where the hell you been ? " he demanded of Pablo . " Who in fuck said you could just take off ? " " I got finished loading , " Pablo told him . " You were crapped out , so I thought I 'd go over and lift a few . " Negus staggered out of the pilothouse . He looked slack with his day 's drinking , his anger weak and without menace . " Nobody told you you could have that pistol . Give it here . " " I need protection , " Pablo said , " if I 'm gon na walk around theseforeign places . " He handed Negus his forty-five . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This ai n't the goddamn Waterman Line , " Negus said , as though he had thought of saying something else instead . " Hell , I was over with Tino before . I thought it must be all right . " " Where is Tino ? " Negus asked . " Was he with you ? " " Have n't seen him since this afternoon , " Pablo said . He walked back to the lazaret with Negus ' frail curses behind him . Down in the compartment , he propped the hatch cover open with a marlinspike and lay down on his rack . When he closed his eyes , luminescent ranges of coral began to form behind them . Godoy 's church was in the hills above Puerto Alvarado , a square structure of whitewashed clay with the shapeless parody of a Norman steeple over its doorway . As soon as Justin opened the unpainted wooden door she heard the babies crying . Some Indian couples had come down from the Montana to have their infant children christened . The Indians knelt gravely in the candlelight around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were never sold in shops or exported , the men in khaki shirts and trousers , clutching straw sombreroswith red and black marriage bands like coral snakes around the crown . The older children knelt behind the adults , equally grave and silent . In turns the women rose to offer up their weeks-old infants and as Godoy , unassisted , poured the sacramental drops , the church would fill with the babies ' thin cries and the liturgical hum of the godparents reciting their oaths . Justin sat waiting in a rear pew , out of the light . When she had been seated a minute or two , she looked across thep260church and saw two men , one white and the other Negro , sitting in a pew opposite . The two men had turned to watch her ; they did so unselfconsciously . One of them had thrown a lazy arm around the back of the bench on which he sat . The men were wearing cheap silky sport shirts of a bright print . Justin ignored them and sat facing the baptismal font . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blessed the Indians and his church , the two men crossed themselves . Justin , out of reflex , did the same . Father Godoy , with a smile , walked the Indians to the door . Each of them turned their eyes toward Justin as they passed her ; not one , not even the children , glanced at the men in the print sport shirts . Godoy opened the church door and stood in the doorway , a rhombus of fiery light , shaking hands and bestowing felicitations . The Indians gone , he remained there , shielding his eyes from the glare . The surpliceover his black cassock was real lace , Justin saw ; it was a strangely rich thing in so poor a place . A gift from his mother , she thought . Vestments were what their mothers gave them . The two men in the church stood up , and passing Justin , affected to examine her with an insolence enriched by four hard centuries of tradition . At the doorway , they did as well for Godoy . When the two were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and locked it . " Thank you for coming up , " the priest said to Justin . He approachedher and offered his hand with the same manner and with the same smile that he had employed for the Indian parents . The recognition of this troubled Justin slightly : she decided that it was his sincerityshe saw . " I 've been waiting to hear from you , " Justin told him , as indeed she had been . Together they walked toward the front of the church and Godoy went to the baptistry to blow out the candles around the font . Justin sat in a forward pew to the left of the altar . With the candles out , the church was almost in darkness , lit only by two small windows of imitation stained glass over the ceiling beams and the red sanctuary lamp . He sat down beside her and she could barely see his face . Theyp261were close together , nowhere touching ; two creatures of sacerdotal Clark . " I sent for you to tell you I was leaving , " the priest said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the silence of the church , she thought he must have heard her shocked intake of breath . She fixed her eyes on the lamp beside the tabernacle . " The work is in the mountains . It 's very important for us to be there now . " " Of course , " Justin said . " Whatever the necessity ... wherever it 's going on . . . you should be . " She could not get it to come out right but her voice never broke . " In the mountains we have started collectives  --  ejidos . There are nuns working there and the Indians are organized . They 've done wonderful things there , these nuns . Our compadresitas . " Unlike the nuns here , Justin thought , who tend to be twittish , sentimental and useless . And who are not above a rush of raw hatred for the wonderful compadresitas in the mountains . " We have the land there , " Godoy told her . " We have it by right of occupation and by right of law . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guardia to take it back if we let them . But we 're not going to let them . This time we resist , you see . And all over the country we will resist . " " What about the foco here ? " Justin asked . " Is it going to happen ? " " Absolutely it will happen . When the signal is given . Arms are on the way . And it will be soon . Absolutely . " " And how will I know what to do ? " " You 'll be directed by people who know you . You must prepare . " " We might have done things here as they did in the mountains , " Justin said sadly . " We might have organized collectives on the land . " " The situation is different here . Here the foreign companies have what they want and the structure is not so visible . Also one is cut off on this coast . It can be liberated only together with the rest of the country . " " I thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I was n't looking around me . I was n't seeing . In all this time . . . " She could hear Godoy tapping his fingertips on the pew bench , impatiently.  | " Do n't reproach yourself . You have your job and I have mine . " After a moment she said : " I 'm sorry you 're leaving . " Godoy himself was silent for a while . She waited in the darkness for his answer . " Interrupted friendships are disappointing " was what he said . " Yes , " Justin said calmly , " but I suppose they 're very much part of the work . " " Sadly so . " Sadly so . He had done her the courtesy of informing her personallyof his leaving and he wanted her to be off . " How much notice do you think I 'll have , " she asked him , " before the dispensary is needed ? " " You were told to be ready at the shortest possible notice . At most you will have only a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Justin said . " I must go very soon . I have many things to do before I leave for the mountains . " " Yes , " Justin said . " I have to go myself . " In fact she had nowhere to go . Nothing of any value to attend to except the nursing of a dying drunk . They sat beside each other , neither moving . Will you just touch me , Justin thought , will you do only that much ? I will do whatever you ask , I will face the Guardia , I will die , I will try to kill for you , will you just touch me ? Will you do something for me , to me ? Will you give me your hand ? Will you give me any-thing ? Godoy stood up and waited in the aisle for her to do the same . She rose and walked the length of the aisle with him . A key was in his hand . " Father Godoy , " she said to him . He had not looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was now unlocking . " Father Godoy ! " She nearly shouted it at him . " What I care about ... maybe all I care about . . . is me ! Not about this country . Only about the way I myself feel . " He looked at her in silence for a moment and then he smiled . He had a sad smile for all the wind and weather , she thought . " I think we are all that way deep inside . But there can be a coincidence of interest , can there not ? Between justice and one 's feelings . "  |p263In  despair , she played the schoolgirl and then the penitent . " Of course . But before I go there is something I want to say . I want to say it because we may never meet again . My feeling for you is particular . I have come to feel about you in a particular way . " Godoy had opened the door a crack . She stepped back from the light so that he might not see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy not to say anything . And then to say it in the absurd language of the cloister . Now it was too late . In time suspended , she watched him search for an answer , saw his brows knit , his eyes shift . Then , without looking at her , he said : " I feel the same about you . " Immediately she knew that he was lying . Whatever his feelings might be , his declaration to her was a simple lie , a pacifier . She watched the Adam 's apple bob in his white throat above the top button of his cassock and the thought came to her that he must be quite good at lying . But for her he was not trying very hard . " There you see the extent of my selfishness , " she said . Driven by the lie , she could not stop . " And my smallness and foolishness . " Godoy was genuinely embarrassed and perhaps concerned for his foco . " Please , " he said . He opened the door and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am your friend , you can believe that . I need you to help me . These poor also need you . " " There was never any question of that , " she said . " I 'll be there when you need me . " Another melancholy smile . " Until later then , dear friend . " " Yes , until later , " Justin said , and went down the three whitewashedsteps . The two men in print shirts were on the corner and she needed all her strength to walk past them , calm and heedless with a friendly , superior nod . On the drive back she let herself cry . She cried from shame and from revulsion at his deceit and unctuousness . But he was right , she thought . Her feelings were a child 's feelings , and they were a matter of no importance . It was she , by all the rules of all the games , who was wrong . By the time she was most of the way along the beach road , the sun was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean , climbed out and walked to the water 's edge . For ap264long time she looked out over the ocean before her , still in sunlight and deep blue . In all the working systems , she thought , the weakness was always yourself  --  that spot of gristle in the gears . It applied on every level  --  even the act of getting through a day could be performed with gusto and dispatch if you kept out of your own way . Justin believed that she knew as much as anyone about self-struggle . But if I win , if I crush myself , she wondered , what will be left of me ? She was not so much afraid as curious . Would what was left be useful ? And if so , in what way ? Would what was left be happy ? And there I am again , she thought . Me . The self was only a girl , a young thing , brought in arsy-varsy . A One True Church was a One True Church , a scientific system was a scientific system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a broad was only a broad . It was all so obvious . I am unworthy , she thought . You are . We are . They are . We are all fucked flat unworthy , unworthy beyond belief , unworthy as a pile of shit . Help us there , you  --  help us crush ourselves out of recognition , help us to be without eyes without pudenda without any of those things . Most of all make us without childish feelings . Because it 's that kid inside that makes us so damnably unworthy . We 'll scourge ourselves , we 'll walk in the fiery furnace , we 'll turn ourselves around . To do penance and to amend my life , amen . To struggle unceasinglyin the name of history . Gim me a flag , gim me a drum roll , I 'm gon na be there on that morning , yes I am . And it wo n't be the me you think you see . It 'll be the worthy revolutionary twice-born me . The objective historical unceasingly struggling me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning , she thought , I wo n't be anywhere at all . She walked a few steps into the mild surf , wetting her chino trousers to the knee , and cupped two handfuls of salt water to pour over her face . When she started back to her jeep it was a few minutes before twilight and the hillside across the road had started to settle into evening . The first howler monkeys were awake and signaling their alarms , the diurnal birds settling down to cover among the thickest boughs , trilling the last calls of the day . Something was in the road ahead ; Justin stopped in her tracks . It was an animal running along the inshore shoulder , but it did not runp265so much as prance . And it was not an animal , it was a kind of man . The light was still strong enough for her to make out some of its colors  --  a topping of flaxen hair , white garments that were stained . Back behind the wheel , she could not be certain that the stains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . No fruit she knew would stain that brightly . She could not make the stains be anything but blood . And she understood then that the creature she had seen was the young Mennonite who had passed the mission weeks before . The hillside now was darkening and apparently deserted , the road empty of traffic . Justin shivered , turned her headlights on and started the jeep for home . Holliwell hobbled along a rutted pathway lined with frangipani toward the dining hall . The stars were out , the wind easy . The half dozen working tables in the Paradise 's utilitarian refectorywere lined up along the seaward edge of the hall . Japanese lanterns hung from the rafters above them and from wire stays in the palm grove between the tables and the beach . On the other side of the huge floor space , some officers of the Guardia were lined up at the bar , drinking rum and listening to old Lucho Gatica records on the jukebox . Looking over the line of tables , Holliwell saw Mr. Heath sitting by himself over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called him over . " Hurt your foot , did you ? " he asked . His face was florid in the lantern light , his nose and the skin under his eyes marked with swollen veins . " I kneeled on a sea urchin over by the Catholic mission . There was a nun standing by to pull the spines out for me . " " Good luck . Was that sister Justin ? " " I never asked her name . I think she 's the only one there . " " Yes , " Heath said . " What brought you over that way ? " Holliwell shrugged . " Nothing special . " " What do you make of them over there ? " " I do n't know what to make of them , " Holliwell said . " What do you make of them ? "  |p266did  n't you think ? " " Yes , " Holliwell said . " Yes , they are . " Heath and Holliwell dined on fresh dorado . As they took dinner Mr. Heath said that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Old hands like me are redundant since the blight , " he told Holliwell . " The profits are in tourism . So it 's take that up or retire . " " And which will you do ? " Heath smiled vaguely . At that moment , Holliwell realized how drunk the man was . " When I first came out here , " Mr. Heath said , " ten bandits and myself were the only force of law in two hundred miles of mountains . Great days they were . " Holliwell nodded . " We could put a company blanket on a tree stump  --  leave it for weeks and no one would dare touch it . We were respected . We respectedourselves as well . Every morning I could get up and say  --  Yo se quien soy . Understand ? " " Sure , " Holliwell said . " My men were able to say that because I made them able . And I did n't do it by avoiding their eyes and tipping them ten shillings for smiling at me . D'ye see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It reflected my training . " Holliwell was about to ask him where his training had been acquired . " Nineteen years of age I was in the legion  --  the Legion Etrangere . Sidi Barras . Christ , great days ! " " And you came here after that ? " For his question , Holliwell received a momentary glance of dark and profound suspicion . It was a look to stay the timid and was obviously meant to be . " After that I was in the Ceylon police . Had a bit of trouble there ... a damn religious procession in Kandi . I was shown the instruments , you might say . Drove off in superintendent 's car after a party and that was that . Then I came out here . " " Do you ever go back to England ? " " Ca n't , " Heath said . " She 's not there , bless her . Not my England . Of course , I was home for the war . I was with the Second Army . " " Montgomery . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Monty . Teetotaler . " When the server took their plates , he called for more gin . Holliwell , who was fighting a wave of fatigue , would try to counter it with another small rum . " We 're going to have tourists coming down here at the rate of a few thousand a month . We 're going to have me spying through keyholesso the hotel staff does n't pinch their Minoxes . We 're going to teach the people to steal and we 're going to teach them contempt for us . " Holliwell began to say something about jobs for the populace . About giving them a share . " These people do n't like being poor , Holliwell . No one does . We 're going to teach them to be ashamed of being poor and that 's something new , you see . " " That 's the American way , " Holliwell said . Heath sniffed . " Do n't like to see a man run his country down . Not abroad . " " I 'm not doing that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exportable . " Mr. Heath did not hear him . " We 're all wringing our bloody hands , that 's it . We 've been doing it since the war . Apologizing and giving in and giving over and not one black , brown or yellow life have we saved doing it . We want to be destroyed , you see . So we will be . " At the bar , the celebrating Guardia officers had grown progressivelymore hilarious . But a few of them , drunker than the others , were subsiding into a sinister quietude . They were not coastal people but Indians and mestizos from over the mountains and their style of being drunk was different . They leaned on the bar as though holding themselves up , communicating to each other in single shouted words , in whistles , sudden gestures , bursts of unpleasant laughter . Some telepathy of alcohol . The Miami dentist came in , accompanied by a tall youthful man in an elegant guayabera . Behind them came Mrs. Paz and her sons , all combed and scented . Their entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers at the bar . Holliwell gave them good evening and Heath , who apparently knew the tall man , did the same . The tall man , Holliwell assumed , was Mrs. Paz 's brother . ' When the Cuban party were seated and served , an Americanp268couple came in from the darkness outside , and seated themselves at a table behind Holliwell 's chair . Holliwell had time to observe them as they passed . The woman was of a certain age  --  perhaps in her forties , though she might also have been sixty or even older . She wore a muumuu with a coral necklace at her fleshy throat , and her hair , dyed deep black , was pasted against her temples like Pola Negri 's . The man was lean , pale and thick-lipped . He had very close-shaven hair and small dark eyes ; his face preserved a kind of desiccated youthfulness . He was in white , even to his loafers . The couple 's entrance induced an attitude of watchful menace in the drunken Guardia officers at the bar . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sit down , drawing thoughtfully on the lemon slice that had come with his fish . " Stew Nabbs was in Key West , " Holliwell heard the man say . He himself was at the point of exhaustion . Of course the rum did not revive him . " Ugh , " the woman muttered in a deep coarse voice , " the pits . The pits . " The man giggled . A tiny-eyed giggle . " Well , " Holliwell told his dining companion , " I 'm going to bed . I 'm out of it . " Mr. Heath leaned forward and addressed him softly with a bland half smile . " You 're not to go . Stay where you are . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand , " Holliwell said . Heath glanced over Holliwell 's shoulder at the couple and fixed his eyes on Holliwell 's . " I want you to listen to these people . They 're extremely interest-ing . " " What a guy , " the man behind Holliwell was saying to his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's living it up in Key West . A house , you know ? A bankroll . Fuckin ' guy . But it wo n't last . " Holliwell shrugged and frowned a question at Mr. Heath . But Heath had settled back like a man about to listen to some beloved music.  | " Stay , " Heath whispered . " Listen . " " You lived with him , " the woman said . " I went by his pad up there . Off Duval . He 's got a kid passed out in the garage  --  the kid 's fourteen ? Fifteen ? On a tank of gas . I split . I said , See you , Stewart . ' " " You were his pal , " the woman said . " New York , Clyde Hotel . Aagh . That fuckin ' place . Needle Park over there . " " Hey , " the woman crooned . " Hey , I remember , Buddy . Do I remember ? " " You remember Phelan , the loan shark ? " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring her face to mind again . " You were also , Buddy . And Stew . " " Everybody was . Me and Stew were supposed to be whattayacallit . His men . " " His leg breakers , " the woman said . In a sweet singsong , like one reminding a child of a lesson forgotten . " And legs were broken , in my recollection . " The man began to curse immoderately . " How was your dive today ? " Heath asked . " I was just thinking of the dive , " Holliwell said . " It was a lot of things . " The young man was speaking again . " That little harelip from Riker 's . The fuck was doing six bits a day and going to Phelan . Simpleminded . Phelan says put the arm on the little stiff . So we go to the big hotel there , the Ansonia . They got offices there , everything . Pay phone and we order shit from Riker 's . An hour later comes the harelip and we jump him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runs up a dozen flights of stairs . Finally me and Stew get him on the top floor . We hold him over the stairwell by his feet and it rains coin . His change , his wallet , his works , everything goes  --  and he 's upside down there making little bird noises . The whole goddamn time he never let go of that burger . " " Down the purple corridor , " the woman declared , " the scarlet ibis screaming ran . " " You know what Phelan says ? He says how come you did n't drop him ? " Holliwell 's eyes met those of Mr. Heath.  | " Twixt , was n't it ? " Heath asked . " I remember that wall very well . See anything marvelous ? " " There was something down there . I do n't know what . " " Stew had holes in his shoes , " Buddy told his dining companion . " He wore rubbers every day . Fucking Clyde Hotel . " " And Phelan passed away ? " " Did he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening ? " Heath asked Holliwell . " Oh , " Holliwell said , " I suppose . I gather it 's a sinister place . " " It 's never been my idea of a sinister place , " Heath said . " Right after Phelan got it , " the man behind Holliwell said , " Stew 's wig snapped . He went funny . " " Ha , " the woman said , " I heard . I know what it was . " " No , Olga , " the man said . He lowered his voice . " No , you do n't . " The officers at the bar were much quieter now , drunk almost to silence . They neglected to play the jukebox . At one end of the dining hall , a waiter was counting out white candles from a stack on a table before him . " We were still in the Clyde . Stew was chicken-hawking . All these kids , in and out . He dealt . He had a string . " " Those kids are lousy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left town . He did one . " " He did ? " " He did one . He took this chicken out . " " Curtains ? " " I 'm telling you , " Buddy said . " He went to L.A. I saw him there . Hollywood he went to . " " The Boulevard of Broken Dreams , " Olga said . " He had chickens on skateboards . Dolls , a couple . Hustling . " " Tray bizarre , " Olga said . " Bizarre . He was on Percodans . He was into snuffing . Him and a friend . " " Some friend . " " They had clients took pix . They ran the roads , Stew and this friend . Chicken snatching . Kids up the bazoom , they grabbed them . The freeways , like . Off the street . " " Gollywilkins , " Olga said . The Japanese lanterns in the palm grove flickered , went out , thenp271cause on again . The officers at the bar were leaving . One of them staggered past the tables into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frangipani . Over the palm crowns hung an infinity of stars . " It 's the simple life down the wall at Twixt , " Mr. Heath told I lolliwell . " Clean down there . One sees so far . " " I was thinking it was the same up here . " " Humanist fallacy , " Heath said . " Appearances deceive . There 's a philosophical difference . " Holliwell was unable to answer . Mr. Heath had proved himself a philosopher and once again Holliwell caught the saffron taste of Vietnam . The green places of the world were swarming with strongarmphilosophers and armed prophets . It was nothing new . Heath was looking over Holliwell 's shoulder , holding his expression of affable uninterest . Buddy had lowered his voice further , it trembled with rodential wariness . " Chickens were disappearing . Stew had these pix . He sold them . Famous names , he says . " " Intense . " " Me , I 'm shit scared . I know this is happening . Stew knows I know . His friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The cops are finding these children , Olga . Blipped . Bitty kids almost . Sans parts . It 's big in the paper . " " The parents do n't care , " Olga said . " They sell them . " " Snuff pix , chickens , that was Stew . He was obnoxious about it . He said it was big . " " Did he say he liked it ? " " He never said . I figure he liked it , right ? I was scared , Olga . I left town . " " The kids ask for it sometimes , " Olga said . " They 're lousy at that age . " That 's what Stew says . I says : See you , Stew . I was scared . " " This , " Olga said , " is why I wo n't live in Los Angeles today . " When they stood up , Heath gave them a friendly nod . Holliwellforced himself not to turn around . " Do you know how I came to notice them ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " It was a way of laughingp272that bastard had . When I heard him laugh I knew what I had before me . " Not your ordinary run of tourist , " Holliwell offered . " Yes . . . well , what 's ordinary today ? There 's a very rubbishy sort of American loose on the world these days . If you do n't mind my saying so . " " All kinds of people have money and leisure in the States . Surely you know that . " " I thought the American of thirty years ago was a better type , " Mr. Heath said . " Not much savoir-faire but a sounder sort of chap . " " I know who these people are , " Holliwell said . " I know what they come out of . I know more than I want to about them . " " So their dinner conversation does n't shock you ? " " Does it shock you ? " " Not me , mate . I was there when we went into Belsen and quite honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it do for you ? " " It aroused my workmanlike instincts , " Mr. Heath said . " I have the same reaction to . . . them . " " Olga and Buddy . " " Yes . Olga . And Buddy . They make me think  --  ha , boyo . Time to go to work . " " It is the same , " Holliwell insisted . " Up here and down the wall . It 's the same process . " " That 's very tender-minded of you . Are you going to tell me all that lives is holy ? " " Not me , " Holliwell said . " But even Olga and Buddy have a kind of innocence , do n't they ? And their friend in the story ? " " Holliwell , " Heath said . " Holliwell  --  God may forgive Olga and Buddy and company  --  he does n't have to share the world with them . You have children , I suppose ? " Holliwell confessed that he did . " There 's someone murdering children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's killed five kids already . " " I did n't know . But that has nothing to do with these people . " " Do n't you know your own side , man ? I can assure you that I do . And when I hear that laugh  --  when I catch that pong in the air I feel like our good missionary friends , ready to go into my cure of souls.  |p273I  believe that God gave the likes of Olga and Buddy and the late Rudolf Hoess into my especial keeping . But because this civilization is corrupt and cowardly , because it insists on being tyrannized by weak , bent neurotics who do n't know the fucking meaning of self-respect or mercy  --  I ca n't do my job . " His knuckles were white on the glass of gin . He blinked and sipped of the drink and smiled again . " So I feel frustrated , you see . " The officers of the Guardia were leaving the bar . The last to go whistled unpleasantly for the shy black barmaid who had been nervouslyserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed a wad of bills under the bodice of her bright tight dress . Then he turned and watched the two men at the table across the hall . " I 'm a copper , really , " Heath said . " Why did you ask me if I was frightened down the wall ? " " Ah , " Heath said , " rude of me . Sorry . " " I did n't think it was rude . Just a little peculiar . " " My manners are dreadful , " Mr. Heath said . " I expect I 'll have trouble in the resort business . " At Serrano on the windward shore , the frayed ends of a norther whipped the winch chains against the stabilizers and set the mooring lines to groaning . The dock lights showed soiled whitecaps speckling the milky harbor . Pablo worked the fuel line with one of Naftali 's pier hands . Freddy Negus leaned against the bridge housing , smoking , staring into the darkness beyond the lights . He was waiting for Tino . Naftali 's men worked quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were loaded in the holds on a waterproof tarp ; the tarpaulin'sends were tucked down and the holds half filled with sixteenpoundblocks of ice . Within an hour of tying up , the Cloud was nearly ready to get under way again . In other circumstances , Negus would have kept a close eye on the loading , but on this night he let the dockers go about their work unsupervised . His attention was fixed on the unlighted road that led to the pier . Across the bay , the lights of an oil refinery glowed like the towers of a phantom city . Slightly above them , on a cactus-covered hillside deep in darkness , were the dim , scattered lights of Serranop274Town . A wall of barbed fencing and thorny acacia divided Naftali 's marina from the desert wilderness outside . The dirt road that led to the pier was blocked by two Dodge trucks parked head to head across it ; fifty yards beyond them was a steel hut lit by a single naked bulb over its doorway . A man with a holstered pistol stood under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the cockpit . " I reckon he 's not coming , " Negus said . Mrs. Callahan was stocking the galley shelves ; Callahan himself was bent over his charts . " And what does that mean ? " Deedee Callahan asked . " He never done this before , " Negus said . Callahan said nothing . " Listen , " Negus said , leaning on Callahan 's chart table . " Put it together , man . We 've got this punk off the coast on our hands . Then Tino goes over and he does n't come back . " " What are you suggesting ? " Callahan asked . " That the kid did away with him ? " " By Christ , I wish I knew . But all of a sudden Tino 's gone and he does n't come back . Either he 's in something he ca n't get out of  --  or else he thinks the deal 's queer and he 's pulling out . " " Would n't he have let you know ? " Deedee asked . " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't able . " Negus turned from the chart table and looked out through the windshield at the dark water . " It 's always number one first in this business . That 's the rule . " Callahan kept his eyes on the chart , not answering . When the fueling was done , Pablo took a brief turn at loading crates . He , too , was watching the dark road that led to the pier , thinking of the room in the Hollandia Hotel where the wind chime would be sounding faintly on the light breeze . From the pilothouse he heard Negus ' rasping petulant drawl . As he stepped onto the dock , he noticed that the armed man beside the shed had turned to look down the road , and that far in the distance along it was a flickering , waveringlight . Pablo glanced over his shoulder at the pilothouse and jogged toward the shed . " What 's up ? " he asked the guard.  |p275The  guard looked at him , shrugged and looked down the road again . As the light drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bicycle ; a tall islander wearing a mack 's violet platform shoes was pumping it along the sand-and-shell track . He pulled up beside the iron shed and wiped the sweat from his eyes . He and the man who stood by the shed spoke together in Papamiento . The rider held a manila envelope in his hand . " Boy come up from town , " the guard told Pablo . " Got a letter for Mr. Negus . " Pablo turned around and saw that the bulk of the iron shed stood between him and the Cloud 's bridge . " I 'll take it , " he said . " You Mistuh Negus ? " " That 's right , " Pablo said . " Just give it here . " The man with the bicycle spoke again . He , too , wore a pistol on a web belt around his waist . " This man say the boy come from the city . Twenny mile . Got to give him sometink . " Pablo reached into his pocket for a handful of island bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rider 's hand . He had no idea of how much they might amount to ; they turned out to be enough . While the guard and the armed rider stood by , Pablo walked to the light from the shed 's doorway and stood where he was still out of eye line from the shrimper 's deck . He took a note out of the manila bank envelope and read by the naked bulb . " Deer Fredd , " said the note , " I muste tell you in haaste . Thees jung pog Pablo ben by Naftalie and that man by him morded . Sure bad you knowe it yeerself . You know brudeer I ben skipping wit you everie ways but thees onie gone be deadt ver us .

" Dey tell de boy wait for an answer . " " No answer , " Pablo said . " It 's all right . " Pablo pursed his lips inp276outrage . " Damn lucky you got up here , " he told the blank-faced rider . " Really appreciate it . " In the wheelhouse , Mr. Callahan was setting his Rolex to the time signals from Corn Island . Negus ran his hands through his thinning hair as though the steady double beats from the receiver were flaying his nerves . " If Tino does n't show , " he told Callahan after a moment , " I 'm not going . " " We 've just concluded that he is n't going to show , " Callahan said . " Have we not ? " Deedee Callahan looked in turns at Negus and at her husband , the shell of a pistachio nut clenched in her white teeth . " Stop it , Freddy , " Callahan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a damn fool , " Negus said . " That 's what you are . " " Where is our sloe-eyed boy ? " Callahan asked his wife . " Where 's he got to ? " Deedee put her head out to see . " He 's up on the hatches , " she said . " Looks like they 're about done . " " Go and stroke him , " Callahan said . " Keep him out of harm 's way . Freddy and I have to talk . " He watched his wife smooth her hair as she went forward . " If you do n't go , Freddy , I ca n't go . And God knows I 've set my heart on it . " " You have to know when not to go . Callahan . I do if you do n't . " " Freddy , " Callahan said , " you owe me one . " " Not my bloody life , Jack . I do n't owe you that . " Callahan rolled up the chart he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " I ca n't go just me and Deedee and that kid from nowhere . Those bastards on the coast  --  they 'll take the weapons and then they 'll board and sink us . I need at least one man I can trust . " " Do n't go . " " My dear man , I have to go . I must . I bet the ranch on this run . Negus looked away from him . " Remember what happened to Otis in Grenada , Freddy ? Him shorthanded and his boat full of M-i 's ? "  | " He made it to St. Eustatius , " Negus said absently . " They 're good people there . " " Now here we are , " Callahan said . " We 've paid and we 've loaded cargo . We ca n't quit now . I ca n't . " " I can , " Negus said . " Tino did . " Callahan closed his eyes , rested an elbow on the chart table and put his hand over his eyes . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board until we deliver . Pablo wants to do us , it 's the money he 's after . We can keep him in line until then . " " Maybe . What about then ? " " Then , " Callahan said , " kill him . In fact he 's yours for the whole run . If you seriously feel he 's more trouble than he 's worth , deep-six him . I 'll leave it to your discretion . " Negus was silent for a while . Callahan turned in his seat to read the tide tables . " No chance of paying him off now and turning him loose ? " " No chance , " Callahan said without looking up . Negus leaned in the hatchway , his teeth set in a rictus of unease . " Shit , if it 's up to me I 'll put him over as soon as we clear the reef . " " No , you wo n't , chum . You 'll be patient . When the balloon goes up you may learn to love him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her in surprise . " Where 's the kid ? " " He 's right where he was , " she said . " What 's happening , gentlemen ? Are we setting forth or not ? Because this vessel 's all loaded and the dock boys are wondering what we think we 're doing . " " Take her out , Freddy , " Callahan said . Negus put his fishing cap on , went out on deck and shouted at Pablo to let go the mooring lines . Callahan took the whiskey down from a pantry shelf and poured himself a shot . " And how 's our young man ? " he asked . " He 's in some kind of sulk . You ever see a speed freak trying really hard not to talk ? That 's how he is . " " In the words of a great Irish wit , " Callahan said , " it 's not enough to opt for silence . You have to consider the kind of silence . "  | " Ah , " Deedee said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , I do n't like this too well . " " You could have fooled me . " " He is bad news . He is , he is . " " Then we 'll kill him , " Callahan said . " Stay close to him . We 'll want to know what 's on his mind . " " He 's not dumb . Remember that . " " Is n't he ? " " Not at all . He 's pretty fucking clever . " " Too bad , " Callahan said . " So this time it 's me who gets to drink if I 'm supposed to stay close to him . And it 's you that stays sober . Because he 's not dumb and you better be on top of things . " " You 're right , of course . " " Damn straight , " Deedee said . " Some fun , hey , boss ? " " That 's what we 're here for , " Callahan said . All night they steamed with the stabilizers down , rolling almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roseate raft of clouds was massed over a solitary mountain to southward . Clouds there seemed to slip away reluctantly on the wind and were replaced by others that , singly or in packs , came over the flat far horizon and made straight for the veined slopes that were brightening to green . It was San Ignacio , once English , then Colombian and Panamanian by turns , now its own , or anyone 's , island . Pablo had settled in the lee of the after hatch ; sleeping in short fits , sliding into undersea dreams , awakening to the stars . Spray had started him once and he had lifted his head to see white water racing under the rails and felt the vessel 's boards tremble from the power of the engines and a steady slap of the bow against the sea ahead . They had been making a speed which he could not calculate but a speed of which no shrimper on earth was capable . When she settled down to her accustomed fifteen knots he had gone to sleep again . The rumble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He backed off to the rail and turning , saw in the distance a white reef line and green hills fading into cloud . The deep black valleys among the hills were inlaid with rainbows . " That 's Tecan , " Deedee told him . And he recalled that she had been around all through the night ,  |p279smart-talking  and boozing , coming on . He had paid her no mind . She was lying across the hatch cover now , in jeans and no shirt at all , leaning her chin on her hands . Pablo felt for the diamond in his shirt pocket and found it over his heart . He saw Freddy Negus come out of the wheelhouse and engage the windlass engine . They were settling down for the day . Negus never looked in his direction ; he felt that the man was trying not to see him . " So , " Deedee Callahan asked him , " you believe in the invisible world ? " It was just smart talk , but the words troubled him . He turned over the leeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , " he said . " You do n't sleep much , do you ? " " I do n't feel the need of it much . " " In the Navy they say , All time not spent in sleep is wasted . ' Do n't they say that in the Coast Guard ? " " Yeah , " he said . " They do . " He saw that in the smooth flesh of her shoulder there was a miniature tattoo , the links of a chain . It was tiny and elegant , a beauty . She saw him looking at it . " Chain of Cashel , " she told him . " It stands for eternity . On and on and on and on and you do n't know where she starts from and you do n't know whither she goes . So you string along . " She was smoking a reefer . It seemed to him that she had been smoking through the night ; he had been smelling it in his dreams . She rolled over and he looked quickly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a paler tan then her shoulders . " This is Praisegod Reef , " she said . Looking over the side , he saw no reef ; the water under the boards looked as deep and blue as the expanse around them . He turned to look at the coast again , wondering if it could be the same coast they left three days before . " I spent so many mornings here , " she said , offering him the joint . He shook his head . " So many mornings I wonder how many . Morn-ings . " " On this thing ? " Pablo asked  |p280It  seemed to take her a moment to realize that he meant the boat . " Hell , no . " She was looking toward the coast with a melancholy vacant smile . " On the real Cloud . The real article . " " What was that ? " Deedee raised the joint to her lips and drew from it . " That was , " she said slowly , " that was a schooner , boy . Seventy-footer , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lipton Cup racer and you could smell her teak before you saw her coming . That was the real Cloud . " " Where 's she at now ? " Deedee shrugged , pouted her lips and opened them with a little groan . " She 's in times past . Sailing along in past perfect . " Pablo snickered at her . He told her she was stoned . " I been staying awake on this dope , " she said . " It 's good for that . " " How come you been staying awake ? " " How come you have ? " she asked . She got no answer from him . " The We Never Sleep Shrimp and Shit Corp. , right ? Eternal vigilanceis the price of parsley . " Pablo was watching the anchor chain grow taut as they drifted to windward . The hook was fast on bottom . " How come he put the hook over ? " Pablo asked . Deedee flipped the end of the jay overboard and rolled onto her stomach . " Better ask him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dial on the Cloud 's VHF receiver ; the cabin hummed with submarine static and faint Spanish voices . He and Callahan looked at each other and sat back to wait . Callahan glanced at his watch . Quite shortly , what might well have been an American voice came in loud and clear . " Waterbrothers , this is Marie Truman , you copy ? Over . " " Well , well , " Callahan said . " There he is now . " He picked up the mike . " Marie Truman , Waterbrothers . Copy real well . What kind of night you have up there ? "  | " Waterbrothers , Marie Truman . Slow night . Scraping the rocks . We got us a sawfish bill . Over . " Callahan grinned at Negus . " Marie Truman , Waterbrothers . Do n't throw that away , hear ? It 's worth forty bucks on the beach . Over . " " Waterbrothers , Marie Truman . We 'll see you-all up to Gracias a Dios tomorrow . Have a nice day . Over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Waterbrothers . You have a good one too . Out . " " Is n't he a darling ? " he asked Negus . " He 's playing he 's a Texas boat . And he 's got what we want and we have what he wants . " " We still got all day , " Negus said . " If we have him on VHF he 's within seventy miles of here . " Callahan went to the chart table and brushed a worn copy of Bowditchfrom on top of his coastal charts . " By his coordinates he 's coming out from a place called French Harbor . Coming out over a reef . " He took a pair of reading glasses from the breast pocket of his tennis shirt and bent to the chart . " There 's supposed to be a church tower there . Anyhow it 's just a hair down from Puerto Alvarado and they have all kinds of lights . So we 'll run past him around dusk . See what we got to work with and take a sight bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful weather , Freddy . Fair . Light northerly . And no moon until after midnight . " " That guy speaks gringo awful good , " Negus said . " God help us if that 's the Guardia we 're talking to . You know , " he said , " they got a lot of Yankee know-how behind them . " " Ah , Fred , " Callahan sighed , " if they had him they 'd want me . And here I am right on their front porch . " " Maybe they got you and they want him . " " Then how would they have his codes ? Use your head for Christ 's sake . " " Negus went on deck and swept the coastward horizon with his binoculars . " Nothing happening , " he told Callahan when he came in . He set the glasses down in their box beside the windshield . " The thing is , Fred , " Callahan told him , " you do a thing or you do n't . Now we are doing this thing , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . "  | " I was thinking , " Negus said . " Our people could be just a nice bunch of good patriotic Spanish boys . Probably just pay up and take their hardware . Probably would n't give us trouble at all . " " Then we could get rid of Pablo right now , could n't we ? " " That 's right , " Negus said . " But it 's more likely they 're a bunch of fucked-up ratones . You do n't get a good class of Spanish boy on this coast anymore . Not since the cocaine boom . " Negus put his head out of the cabin hatch and looked aft at Pablo , who was propped against the lazaret with his hat over his eyes . " Goddamn that guy , " he said . She was driving in from Alvarado with two ten-pound sacks of beans and a few kilos of fruit when she saw Campos in the road before her . His jeep was parked so that it blocked passage to any other vehicle and he stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster-Grants ablaze in the afternoon sun . Although she had firmly made up her mind not to be afraid of Campos , the positioning of his jeep troubled her . Someone would have to back off  --  a minor matter on the face of it but a confrontation , charged with suggestions of authority , confidence and guilt . She stopped her own jeep in the middle of the road and stayed behind the wheel . Lieutenant Campos came forward and looked her body up and down . His attitude was not in the least jocular or flirtatious . " Sister Justin " was all he said . She tried to find his eyes behind the reflecting glass . " Good afternoon , Lieutenant . " He passed by her and examined the provisions in the rear seat . " We understand you 're leaving our poor country . " " Yes , " she said . " Before long . " " You 've been ordered to go . " " By our provincial , " she said . " As soon as is convenient . " The lieutenant leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty pounds of beans . Going to take them back to Yanquilandiawith you ? "  | " We still have people to feed . " " Hippies , " Campos said . Justin was at a loss for words . It was true that some of the longhairedforeign travelers had been turning up around the mission grounds and some of them looked like settling in . She was aware that Egan had taken to spending his evenings out back and that this visitation somehow involved him . As far as she knew  --  and she kept close accounts  --  the kids in the ruins never stole . They brought in their own provisions . But the business could not have come at a worse time ; somehow she would have to put a stop to it . Since Godoy 's departure she had received no further orders . " We did n't ask for these people , " she said , " and we 're not feeding them . The ruins are a natural tourist attraction . We 're not responsible for our location . " " Hippies are n't tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Justin had the sense that a great deal depended on her behavior at that moment . It was necessary for her to seem confident and also necessary for her to determine what Lieutenant Campos had on his mind  --  never an easy enterprise . Justin had little knowledge of policemenin general but through Campos she had discovered that being crazy did not stand in the way of one 's being a good cop . " So this does n't help the country as a mission should . But the contrary . " What now , she thought , rational discourse ? She had no idea how much he knew or suspected , except that she was somehow subversive . Was he simply upset further about hippies in his jurisdiction ? Was this new apostolate of Egan 's a weakness that he was seizing on to hurry them out of Tecan ? Or was it much more , a little cat-andmousebefore he brought the whole sorry structure down  --  the foco that might or might not be , her , Godoy  --  with his simian Guardia fist ? By God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to he knows more than I do . " If you wish , " she said , " we 'll advise them to move along . On your recommendation . " " They 're murdering children , " he said . " Six children have died . " Justin let go the wheel , which she had held to like a steersman throughout the encounter , and stared at the lieutenant in horror.  | " No ! " was all that she could manage . Her combatant 's poise deserted her . Campos smiled . " Yes . Murdered . Six . " " These killings , " Justin said , " these killings . . . they began months ago . If we had the slightest evidence or suspicion . . . the slightest . . . we 'd report it . " " How do I know that ? " Campos asked . Justin fought to keep her temper in bounds . " We have all been horrified by these murders , Lieutenant . " Her fury grew , but as it did she came to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . " We have all been puzzled by the Guardia 's lack of success in solving them . You can be sure we 'll help in any way we can . " " You 're puzzled by the Guardia 's lack of success ? " " Disappointed . " " Ah , " said Campos as though soothed . " You know , " he said , " it 's funny . We both have uniforms to wear . I wear mine . But you  --  never . Are you still a nun ? " " You can consult the church authorities and the Interior Ministry in regard to that . I 'm a nun . This is not the capital and we 're permitted to dress for work . " " Only a confusion of traditions , then ? " " I suppose , " she said . " Then you may be sure , " Campos said , " that in this jurisdiction you 'll be treated as what you are . " She made herself smile . Whence came the smile and how she had mustered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at him . " We thank you , Lieutenant . " He stood about for a moment whistling tunelessly through his teeth . " Now , Sister , have the goodness to back up your vehicle and let me pass . " She put the jeep in reverse and backed into soft sand hard by the water 's edge . For a moment , the wheels spun ; she cursed softly . The rear wheels spun free of the slough . " Excuse me , Sister , " Campos asked , " did you speak ? " He had backed his own jeep onto higher ground and was straightening out to pass.  | " No , I did n't , " she said . He threw his jeep into gear and gunned the engine briefly . " Nuns do n't curse , " he shouted at her . " Not at me . " And then he was off at his customary speed . " Que le vaya bien , " she said to herself as she eased back onto the track . Driving the rest of the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was very frightened and she wanted nothing more than to go back to her quarters , close the shutters and stretch out in the cool darkness . Things would come clearer to her there . Back at the mission , she showered and lay down ; for a short time , under the weight of her fear and exhaustion , she actually slept . Awakingfrom a confusion of dreams , she found herself confronted with a simple certainty . The notion that the Devotionist mission at French Harbor could be used as a tactical location in the coming struggle represented a coincidence of fond fantasies . It had been compounded of her own egoism and the Tecanecans ' naive confidence in the protectionafforded by the American flag . If the Movement was dismissive of Campos as a venal thug , then they had not understood his obsessiveness . To them , presumably , he was simply a sly and brutal timeserver  --  the ideal enemy . She herself was convinced that there was more to him than that ; he had a spider'swebaura of schizoid insights around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was always asking Charlie Egan about her , asking the merchants , the campesinos . It was beyond suspiciousness . In a peculiar way , he seemed more intelligent than a social agent of the Guardia should be ; it was as if he had succeeded in becoming everything that the other swaggering sneering bastards of his organization pretended to be . Then , if he was as unsoundly intelligentas she suspected , he would be as attached to the idea of a foco on the coast as the rebels were . He would have planted the idea on his superiors in the capital and he would , of course , have connected it with the straggling Devotionists . It would be , in a sense , his project too . Captain Campos . General Campos . The whole thing suggested internal betrayal as well . Tecan wasfull of police informers ; they would have penetrated the Movement , perhaps to its highest level . A fiasco that dissipated the Republic'srevolutionary energy would buy the government ten years . Or longer . Can it be , she wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
