In the 86-to-11 vote , 50 Democrats and 36 Republicans favored the bill , while 10 Republicans and one Democrat opposed it. // The measure goes now to a conference with the House of Representatives , which passed a similar bill by a 302-to-127 vote in July . <> <> Reagan Expected to Approve // The legislation builds on a proposal made in February by President Reagan , who was acting on the advice of Dr. Otis R. Bowen , the Secretary of Health and Human Services . Mr. Reagan is expected to sign any compromise legislation that emerges from Congress , although he has expressed concern about the costs. // Senator Lloyd Bentsen , the Texas Democrat who was the chief sponsor of the Senate bill , said it would make the biggest changes in Medicare since creation of the program in 1965. // Medicare now finances health care for 3 million disabled people and more than 28 million people 65 years old and over . Under the Senate bill , beneficiaries would not have to pay more than $1 , 850 in 1988 for hospital care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , there is no such limit. // The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate bill would cost $1. 4 billion in the current fiscal year , $3. 3 billion next year and nearly $4. 5 billion in 1990 . Supporters of the bill noted that it called for Medicare beneficiaries to bear the entire cost , by paying higher premiums. // But some conservative senators said they feared the costs might explode in later years , forcing the Government to pay them . These senators said Congress should defer action on the bill because of renewed concerns over the Federal budget deficit stemming from the stock market ' s recent plunge. // Senator Steve Symms , Republican of Idaho , said that if Democrats wanted to " send a strong signal to the markets , " they should take the bill off the Senate floor , at least until they complete work on measures to reduce the deficit. // But Senator George J. Mitchell , Democrat of Maine , said : " This legislation does not add to the Federal deficit . It is , by its terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Senate passed the overall bill several hours after voting to expand Medicare to cover the costs of many prescription drugs for elderly and disabled people outside hospitals . The vote on the drug benefit , which is also to be financed through higher premimus , was 88 to 9 . Under this provision , Medicare would pay 80 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs beyond the first $600 in a year. // Mr. Reagan ' s proposal contained no prescription drug benefit . But Administration officials have been involved in negotiations with Congress on the issue and recently accepted the concept of a drug benefit , with safeguards designed to control costs. // Supporters of the drug benefit said it would be introduced gradually , so as to avoid a sudden , unexpected increase in costs . Under the proposal , Medicare coverage of outpatient drugs would begin in 1990 with anticancer drugs , immunosuppressive drugs and intravenous antibiotics . Coverage of cardiovascular and diuretic drugs would be added in 1991 , to be followed by other prescription drugs in 1993. // Medicare already covers the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals . But it generally does not cover the cost of drugs for outpatients . <> <> Heinz Defends Provision // Senator John Heinz , Republican of Pennsylvania , who offered the proposal to cover outpatient prescription drugs , said , " Older Americans want this benefit , and they are willing to pay for it themselves. " // Under his amendment , the extra monthly premium for prescription drugs could not exceed $2 in 1991 , $3. 50 in 1992 or $4. 80 in 1993. // The Secretary of Health and Human Services could increase the deductible or deny payment for certain categories of drugs if necessary to control the overall cost of Medicare drug benefits. // Mr. Heinz said that , according to the Congressional Budget Office , the cost would be $740 million in 1991 and $1. 4 billion in 1992 . The budget office did not estimate the cost for later years , but again conservative Republican senators said they feared the costs might explode. // " The big expenses will come in 1993 , " said Senator Don Nickles , Republican of Oklahoma . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insisted : " This is no gravy train . This is no giveaway program. " // The Heinz proposal would encourage pharmacists to dispense less expensive , chemically equivalent generic drugs , unless a doctor said explicitly that brand-name products were " medically necessary. " // Under current law , the monthly Medicare premium , $17. 90 , will jump to $24. 80 on Jan. 1 , the biggest increase in the history of the program . Federal health officials said the increase had resulted in part from increases in the volume and cost of doctors ' services. // The bill passed today by the Senate also includes these provisions : // * Medicare would cover up to 150 days of care in a skilled nursing facility in a year , an increase from the maximum of 100 days under current law . The House bill contains a similar provision . Both bills would eliminate the existing requirement that a person must have spent three days in a hospital before Medicare will pay for a stay in a nursing home. // * Medicare would pay for hospice care beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still terminally ill . The House bill has a similar provision. // * The Government would cover at least 21 consecutive days of home-care visits for most Medicare beneficiaries . Current law has generally been interpreted to limit such visits to five days a week for two or three weeks . The House bill would permit Medicare coverage for a maximum of 35 days of home-care visits. $1 , 100 Premium for Some To pay for the new coverage envisioned in the Senate bill , there would be three new sources of revenue : a basic premium of $4 a month , or $48 a year , for each beneficiary ; a separate premium to pay for prescription drugs , and a special supplementary premium , which would rise with a person ' s income , to a maximum of $800 a year in 1988. // Thus , the total Medicare premium could exceed $1 , 100 a year for some people with incomes exceeding $100 , 000 a year. // But Senator Mitchell said that no more than one million people would pay the full supplementary premium of $800. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
