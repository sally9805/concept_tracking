 | You often hear the advice : " Work with a good carbide-tipped saw blade . " You know that tungstencarbide teeth are tough and will stay keen longer than those on an all-steel blade . You also know that carbidetipped saw blades cost much more than all-steel blades . The price of a 10-inch blade can range from $30 to more than $100 . But is price the only mark of a good blade ? There are several things to check before you buy even the costliest blade . Some you can see ? plate flatness , carbide thickness tooth attachment grind quality , blade finish , and even package quality . But there is more : tooth styles , for instance . Like standard blades , carbides are designed for particular applications . Is the " all-purpose " blade really the smartest choice ? Is the blade that 's great on a table saw also good on a radial-arm ? Judging quality " Cemented carbide " is the technically correct term to describe the tooth material on a carbide-tipped blade . An alloy of powdered tungsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( vacuum sintering ) , tungsten carbide is tough ? second only to diamonds in hardness . The final product can contain as much as 94 percent tungsten carbide , with the balance composed of a binder such as cobalt powder . There are many grades of cemented carbides in the saw-blade industry . The most common are Cl , C2 , C3 , and C4 ; the grades refer to the degree of resistance to shock and wear . C4 , with the lowest shock resistance and the highest wear resistance , is the proper choice for general-purpose and crosscut blades . A C2 grade , which is about medium in both areas , is often used on special ripping saws and on blades designed for sawing nonferrous metals .  | If you do n't see the grade marked on the blade , ask what it is . Another key quality indicator is " runout " - . the term for the wobble that occurs when the blade is trning . Runout tolerance affects more than the blade 's performance- it determines the accuracy of the initial toothgrinding phase during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise grinding on both sides of each tooth . Runout is not something you can check in the store , but you can examine the package to see whether the manufacturer touts his quality control . Or you can ask a knowledgeable salesperson . And you can check the blade 's flatness , as I 'll explain . The manufacturer that pays careful attention to flatness is also likely to produce a blade with minimum runout . When you get the blade on your saw , you can test for runout with your first cut : If your kerf is wider than the blade 's teeth , you 've got runout . Examining the blade Take two testing tools with you : a short steel straightedge and a hand lens . To test blade flatness , place the straightedge across the body of the blade so it rests between teeth , and then hold the blade up so you can get some backlighting . If the plate resembles an undulating horizon , you know that its flatness received less than expert attention . Also examine both sides of the blade for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teeth . These show the blade was finished by surface grinding instead of being sanded or simply polished . The marks indicate prideful attention to plate flatness . The rings can be quite fine so , to see them , hold the blade at an angle so light will fall across it . Next , determine whether the manufacturer states maximum rpm ? preferably on the blade . Ratings will vary with blade diameter . A six-inch blade may run as high as 12.000 rpm , a 20-inch blade as low as 3,000 . Usual maximum rpm for a 10-incher is about 7,000 . An rpm rating also tells you that the plate has been tensioned ? hammered to relieve stresses in the metal that might cause hot spots . Tensioning is a critical element because it controls forces that can cause uneven expansion . This in turn can produce wobble , vibration , and excessive noise . Tensioning also affects safety ? an untensioned blade can crack and even fly apart . Use the hand lens to check several teeth about the perimeter of the blade . Check for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the smoothness of the carbide . The joint should be machine-brazed to give automatic control of joint uniformity and the degree of heat used . Uniformity is a sign of machine brazing . Hand brazing or welding of the teeth introduces a human-error factor . Overheating can destroy the temper of the plate and can result in pinholes in the bonding compound . Surface pinholes may not be too critical as far as the bond is concerned , but they can indicate general quality , so be wary of them . The cutting performance of the blade , its general quality , and how long the initial sharpening will last can be judged by examining the surface texture of the teeth . Tungstencarbide teeth are shaped by grinding procedures . A quickie method is a single rough grinding that leaves ridges you can see and feel . The quality-blade producers will move the product through a second , finishing grind , using a 400-  | grit ( or finer ) diamond wheel , and they will boast of it , either on the blade 's package or in the catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also visible at the shopping place , especially when you use a lens . Study the cutting edge , top , sides , and face of the teeth for smoothness . Grinding marks , if any , should be difficult to see . What about making the flex test that 's often advised ? This requires that you try to flex the blade by grasping its perimeter and applying moderate thumb pressure at its center . I 've tried this on many blades but have n't found one that I 'm able to bend , at least not to the point where the flex could be detected without instruments . My feeling is that when all other factors check out in good style , you can assume that the plate and its temper are acceptable . On the other hand , if a blade does have a visible flex , do n't buy it . Choosing blade type You should expect a lot from an expensive carbide-tipped saw blade , but not everything . The characteristics of wood and the various ways to saw it make it nearly impossible to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between teeth that are shaped for crosscutting. for example , and those that are best for ripping . Crosscut teeth should have sharp side points that will sever wood fibers cleanly . Ripping teeth have a flat top grind so each tooth will work like a tiny chisel to remove a comparatively large chunk of wood . You can see a difference in the waste produced by the blades ; the crosscut 's sawdust is much finer . Combination blades are a compromise ? the blades often include both types of teeth in banks separated by a deep waste-clearing channel or gullet ( see diagram ) . I use such blades quite happily , but do n't expect one to do the optimum job I demand from a blade designed for a particular application . Usually , you 'll find that the blades that come close to doing a perfect job will have many teeth and comparatively small gullets . They will produce burnished edges on crosscuts and miters . Such high-quality blades will also do clean rip cuts , but the latter @# @#  | application , when overdone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ripping operation generally pulls more amps with this kind of blade , so you 'll have to slow the rate of feed . Does this mean that you should have an assortment of carbide-tipped blades ? Ideally , yes ; practically , no . Much depends on what type ? and how much ? woodworking is done . The expert who produces heirloomquality furniture will have several carbide blades : a super blade for edgeto-edge and general joinery and for sawing plywood ; a special blade for ripping ; and a general-use blade for initial sizing cuts . Others can get by with a single combination blade , one with teeth that make it acceptable for ripping , crosscutting , and mitering in hard or softwoods and in wood products . If you can buy only one carbidetipped blade , do n't buy the cheapest one . Designed like a typical all-steel , all-purpose blade ? but with carbide teeth added ? this blade often has a tempting price . It will stay keener longer than its brother all-steel blade . But do n't expect the super performance you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another low-cost blade , the sparsely toothed " economy " carbide blade with only eight or 12 teeth , may be suitable for ripping . But do n't expect it to produce ready-to-assemble cuts . Coddle costly blades Though tough , tungsten carbide is very brittle . Carbide-tipped saw blades should be handled , used , and stored with exceptional care . At my local saw-sharpening shop , I 've seen expensive carbide blades that were sad examples of blade care . Teeth , gullet , and surrounding areas were coated with wood residue ; some teeth were so dull that a lot of carbide had to be removed to resharpen them ; other , chipped teeth required transplants . Keep the blades clean , and have them sharpened before they start chopping . Do n't force cuts . Feeding too fast can cause overheating and wo n't @# allow the teeth to work as they should . Be sure your machine is in correct alignment and that arbor and collars are in pristine condition . Handle the blade with care when it is off the machine ; never place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blades should have special storage facilities ; placing them on a hook or peg is not the best solution . Making one of the cases shown here is a better way to go .
