" My first Derby winner , Cannonade in ' 74 , " he was saying with a smile . " I dreamed I win it the night before. " // But he won ' t be going to the Derby this year . Next to his kitchen table , a pair of crutches rested on a chair. // " I was invited by two friends to go to the Derby anyway , " he said . " But there are so many people there on Derby day . It ' s uncomfortable to go through a crowd on crutches. " // In an Aqueduct spill on March 8 he suffered a broken left leg and a lacerated liver. // " When you leave the jockeys ' room , " he said , " you never know when you ' re not coming back. " // On the first turn at Aqueduct that day his mount High Fallutin clipped the heels of another horse . High Fallutin fell , Cordero flying over the horse ' s head onto the track . As he rolled in the dirt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled once , twice , then I heard , pow , pow , " he recalled . " I felt two impacts on my side , one on my leg . Horses won ' t step on you , but when they ' re in the air avoiding you , they can ' t see you . That ' s when their hooves hit you. " // After the horses galloped on , Cordero tried to get up but he realized his left leg was broken . And from the pain in his side , he thought ribs were broken . Rushed by ambulance to North Shore Hospital , he soon was taken by helicopter to New York University Hospital for emergency sugery. // " I knew I was bleeding inside , I could feel the blood in my stomach , " he said . " I ' ve had 24 accidents , but I never felt like that before. " // When he awakened from the anesthetic after a three-hour operation , he needed a transfusion to replace the blood he had lost from the lacerations caused by the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfusion , " he said , " I heard the hospital people saying , ' We ' re going to lose him. ' " // Slowly , he has recovered . His weight had dropped to 101 pounds , about a dozen under his riding weight . For once he could eat almost anything . He ' s regained most of those pounds . And now , after finishing his crabmeat and tomatoes , he stood up slowly , then lifted the white turtleneck shirt he was wearing under a blue sweater. // " See , 38 stitches , " he said , displaying a long surgical scar from his chest to his navel . " The other scars on the side are from the holes where they drained the blood . But your liver regenerates itself . My liver ' s O.K. now . It ' s my leg that ' s keeping me from riding . It ' s in a 90-degree brace , but I still need crutches. " // He sat down , sipped his orange juice and talked about Mogambo , the 3-year-old colt he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Old Kentucky Home. " // " At the Derby you have to parade a long time , " he said , " Mogambo is the easiest horse to ride , but before a race he goes from very very excited to very very calm . He wants to trot , to jog sideways , his head is down . He gallops to the post . But when he gets in the gate , he goes from a wild beast to as calm as a baby . You could ride him with one finger. " // Jacinto Vasquez , who has won the Derby on Foolish Pleasure and Genuine Risk , will be on Mogambo on Saturday. // " Vasquez is a good rider , he knows the horse , " Cordero said . " But the warmup at the Derby is always tricky . I remember with Cannonade , when he was warming up on the backside the crowd bothered him . And when the race started , we came out of the second hole and got pinched pretty good for four or five jumps . He was way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . If you get stuck there , you ' re stuck . But on the backside I took a shot . We went from 12th to fourth in less than an eighth of a mile. " // Ahead , Triple Crown was on the rail , slightly in front of Destroyer and Hudson County. // " I went between Triple Crown and Destroyer , and when he turned for home , he was two or three in front - a rerun of the dream I had the night before in one of the Holiday Inns there , I forget which one . I woke up that morning , I told my ex-wife , ' I dream I win the Derby , ' and she told me I was riding the pillow all night. " // Two years later , Cordero had another dream before riding Bold Forbes in the Derby. // " I saw Laz Barrera crying in the winner ' s circle , " he said , referring to the trainer . " And when we win , he was crying in the winner ' s circle just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s circle again last year on Spend a Buck. // " When he won the Cherry Hill and the Garden State , I thought he had a good shot . In the Garden State he went the last eighth in 11 and change , that ' s extremely fast . The track at Garden State was hard and fast . But even on the Long Island Expressway , the last eighth in 11 and change , that ' s fast. " // In the gate , Cordero had been concerned about Eternal Prince. // " I was gon na let Eternal Prince go , " he said . " But after a few jumps , I look and I don ' t see Eternal Prince , so I let my horse go . And he took off. " // After his first two Derby victories , Cordero brought the blanket of red roses to Puerto Rico and laid it on his father ' s grave . But not last year. // " I put two dozen fresh roses on my father ' s grave instead , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // He had hoped to ride five Kentucky Derby winners , but he won ' t win this year . And he ' s not sure about next year. // " Before the accident , " he said , " I was thinking this year and next year . But after the accident I decide to finish this year , then see what happens . I like to train , and if I can make half as much money as a trainer , I ' d be O.K. People say good riders don ' t make good trainers . But it doesn ' t have to be that way. " // Cordero Jr. finished his orange juice , then stood up and set himself on his crutches. // " If I get a good Derby horse as a trainer , " he said , " if I can get Pincay or Velasquez to ride him , I ' ll be a good trainer.
