MX stands for Missile Experimental , which hardly inspires confidence . So President Reagan let it be known he wanted to rename it . The National Security Council suggested Themis , for the Greek goddess of order and justice . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger 's choice was Guardian Missile . National Security Adviser William Clark proposed Peacemaker , after the Colt .45 that belonged to his grandfather and now hangs on a wall in his office . This caught the President 's fancy , but White House aides pointed out that the name Peacemaker might violate a copyright or , even worse , be twisted into a pejorative : Pacemaker . Reagan finally compromised on Peacekeeper . Not that it mattered : at week 's end everyone was still calling it the MX.
