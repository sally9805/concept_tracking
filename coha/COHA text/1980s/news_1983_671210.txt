OPERA does not transfer easily to the screen . When it is done more or less straight , as a stage production recorded on film , it tends to look like a gigantic , somewhat clumsy marionette show , no matter how fine the voices . Not much more successful have been attempts to make opera cinematic by placing it in recognizable landscapes , played by nonsinging actors from whose bodies enormous voices magically flow without apparent physical effort. // The two forms do not exactly war with each other . Rather , they have different interests that are less often reconciled by the film maker than they are subjugated , the interests of one at the expense of the other. // All of which is recalled by way of emphasizing the triumph of Franco Zeffirelli , who wrote , designed and directed the dazzling new screen version of " La Traviata , " by Giuseppe Verdi , which opens today at the Paris. // I ' m not sure that Mr. Zeffirelli has discovered any new principles by which all operas can be made more readily accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very real personal triumph , the result of his obvious love and knowledge of opera , which he has directed both here and abroad , and of his experience as a film maker . It ' s not by chance that all of his earlier films , including the disastrously monosyllabic " Endless Love , " have seemed more operatic than cinematic. // Fifteen years ago Mr. Zeffirelli made his hugely popular " Romeo and Juliet , " which looked a lot better than it sounded , something that most audiences couldn ' t have cared less about . It was , after all , a movie. // This " Traviata " is something else entirely , a film adaptation of a classic work that never has the manner of something scaled down or souped up for a mass audience , though I suspect it will be immensely popular anyway . Verdi ' s genius will out , especially when presented with the talent , intelligence and style that have gone into this production. // Starring in the title role is Teresa Stratas , the Canadian-born Metropolitan Opera soprano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her motion picture debut in 1961 , playing an Indian squaw in something called " The Canadians . " As Violetta , Miss Stratas not only sings magnificently but she also looks the role . With her large , dark doe-eyes , her elegant cheekbones and her small , slight figure that seems to have the strength of someone possessed , which Violetta is , Miss Stratas is a screen presense as riveting to watch as to listen to. // It ' s an acting performance of breathtaking intensity . It ' s so good that it eclipses , for the moment anyway , the memory of Greta Garbo in " Camille , " George Cukor ' s 1937 adaptation of the Dumas play that was also the basis of Piave ' s libretto for Verdi. // The camera is not as kind to Placido Domingo , who looks a little mature to be playing Alfredo , the passionate young man to whom the pleasure-bent , fatally consumptive courtesan , Violetta , gives her heart . Yet the enchantment of the movie is such that initial disbelief almost immediately gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy self-assurance of his performance , which is far more than just respectable. // How much better to have Mr. Domingo , the man as well as his voice , than some other tenor , one who ' s five-by-five , or a vapid young actor lip-synching the voice of someone else. // The opera ' s only other major role , that of Germont , Alfredo ' s father , who precipitates the drama by persuading Violetta to renounce his son , is played and sung with effortless style by Cornell MacNeil . The film ' s conductor and musical director was James Levine , with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus . Featured in the spectacular second act ball scene are Ekaterina Maksimova and Vladimir Vassiljev of the Bolshoi State Academic Theater. // Having cast the film very close to perfection , Mr. Zeffirelli has staged it in a way that serves both the film and the grandeur of the score. // There are small but important adjustments , none more effective than the film ' s opening , which becomes the frame for what comes later . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mid-19th century Paris , we hear the melancholy prelude as the camera enters Violetta ' s house with the manner of a discreet bailiff . Sheets cover the furniture in rooms lit only by light filtered through curtained windows. // Though Violetta lies dying in her bedroom at the far end of the apartment , the place is teeming with people - creditors , appraisers , movers - all busily dismantling the home of someone not yet dead . Violetta , still alive but already a ghost , rises and wanders through the rooms , unnoticed by all except one young workman who stares at her with the unembarrassed wonder of someone recognizing a notorious legend . In her delirium Violetta sees the happy days. // The opera ' s first two acts are thus gracefully turned into a single , continous flashback in which we witness her meeting with Alfredo , their few months of idyllic love in the country and then her renunciation of Alfredo to spare his family disgrace. // Some of Mr. Zeffirelli ' s montages , in which he opens up the opera , become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us how Violetta and Alfredo wiled away the hours in their country retreat . Others , however , are surprisingly effective , including the ones in which we see Alfredo ' s sister , for whose happiness Violetta has been urged to give up Alfredo . The actress , unidentified , who plays the sister , looks to have come out of a Rossetti painting and helps fix the film in its time. // " La Traviata " benefits from Mr. Zeffirelli ' s talents as a designer as much as from his gifts as a director . The physical production is lush without being fussy . Nor is it ever overwhelming . This possibly is because at key moments we are always aware of details that , however realistic , remind us that what we are witnessing is not life but a grand theatrical experience . <> It ' s not to be missed . <> <> A Courtesan ' s Love <> LA TRAVIATA , directed , written and designed by Franco Zeffirelli ; director of photography , Ennio Guarnieri ; film editors , Peter Taylor and Franca Sylvi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francesco Maria Piave ; conductor and music director , James Levine with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus ; choreographed by Alberto Testa ; produced by Tarak Ben Ammar ; released by Universal Pictures .
