It is considered the birthplace of rock ' n ' roll , but in the past two decades the Sun Records studio in Memphis has seemed to be in its twilight . Still , music fans who feared that rockabilly might eventually go the way of the turkey trot can take heart . Last week a 1985 version of the legendary " Million Dollar Quartet , " which once included Elvis Presley , was back in Memphis . The veteran country rockers  --  Jerry Lee Lewis , Carl Perkins , Johnny Cash and Presley Replacement Roy Orbison  --  were on hand to record a new album and a television special in the same studio where they got their start some 30 years ago . " We 're not out to recapture that old sound , " said Cash . " We 're here to recapture that spirit we had . I felt that spirit when we hit the city limits , and I feel it even more now that we are together . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
