" Look out ! Here comes the herpes kid . " <P> " I do n't want to touch him . " <P> These jeers greeted Johnny Bigley , 3 , when he arrived at school last week in Pasadena , Md. , escorted by his father . Johnny is too young to understand why he is being spurned by the older children , why all five of his classmates have boycotted the special speech-therapy course he attends , and why their parents sought a court order to bar him from the classroom . <P> Johnny is a victim not only of the disease but of the fears that it arouses , especially among the parents of school-age children . His case is not unique . Several instances of school boycotts involving children with herpes have been reported over the past year , and recently two more came to light . <P> In Council Bluffs , Iowa , more than half the 343 students at Longfellow Elementary School boycotted classes to protest the enrollment of a three-year- old girl with herpes . The local teachers ' union filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , whose name has not been revealed , suffers every five months or so from an eruption of sores on her thighs , forearms or hands . <P> At the Ethel Phillips Elementary School in Sacramento , a similar campaign was directed at a four-year-old boy infected with a form of herpes called cytomegalovirus . Parents picketed outside the school , carrying signs reading YOUR CHILD NEEDS AN EDUCATION , NOT A DISEASE . <P> Public health officials sought to quell the growing panic . " The parents were concerned that their children would get some horrible , disfiguring disease , " says Dr. Steven Strauss , a virologist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md . Strauss went to nearby Pasadena to assure parents , teachers and union officials that their fears were unfounded . Although the herpes viruses can be dangerous for newborns ( sometimes causing blindness , mental retardation or even death ) , they present a relatively minor risk to school-age children . In fact , by age 18 , some 80% to 95% of Americans have been exposed to at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no symptoms at all . True , some 10% to 30% of those exposed to herpes simplex Type 1 will develop cold sores , but these facial eruptions , mostly around the mouth and nose , hardly qualify as a disfiguring disease . The three victims of the boycotts have more serious symptoms because they were exposed prenatally or around the time of birth . <P> According to Dr. Ward Cates , director of the Division of Venereal Disease Control at Atlanta 's Centers for Disease Control , there may actually be an advantage in childhood exposure to herpes . Says he : " Having herpes for the first time as an adult is more serious than having it as a child . " Cates points out that herpes almost always spreads through direct contact with a lesion or saliva or other body fluids . Says he : " The risk of transmission in a school setting is negligible . " <P> Such assurances did not prevent two of the current cases from winding up in court . In both Council Bluffs and Pasadena , judges ruled that the afflicted children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daily inspection by school nurses . The Maryland judge stipulated that Johnny Bigley wear clothing that covers his lesions and ordered special precautions to protect the school employees who change his diapers.
