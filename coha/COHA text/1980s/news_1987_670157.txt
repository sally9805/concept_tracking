Corporate raider Paul Bilzerian may have met his match in little Pay ' N Pak Stores Inc . In the past two days the Florida investor has been hit by adverse court rulings as well as a sudden about-face by his broker . These developments appear to sound the death knell for his long-running effort to acquire the retailer of home-improvement products . Yesterday , a federal court in Seattle broadened an earlier temporary restraining order that blocks Mr. Bilzerian from continuing his pursuit of the Kent , Wash. , company . The court today will consider a preliminary injunction solidifying that order . Reached yesterday at his office in Tampa , Mr. Bilzerian said he would sue Pay ' N Pak , the group that is seeking to take the company private and its financial backers to stop completion of their bid . The investor said he expects to tender his one million-share holding before tomorrow morning ' s deadline . The legal proceedings follow a bizarre series of developments late Wednesday in which Mr. Bilzerian seemed to have wrested control of Pay ' N Pak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley &; Co. , acting on Mr. Bilzerian ' s behalf , arranged a next-day purchase of a 4. 1 million-share block of Pay ' N Pak , representing 41% of its shares outstanding . Added to his current 10% stake , the stock would have given him a 51% majority interest in the company and frustrated Pay ' N Pak ' s bid to go private through a leveraged buyout . That buyout offer , from a group that includes top management , is set to expire at 12 : 01 a. m . EDT tomorrow . But Morgan Stanley , citing " significant legal questions under the tender offer rules , " renounced the trade late in the evening . The New York brokerage firm ' s action in aborting the purchase effort gave it a black eye throughout the securities industry . Even later Wednesday , Pay ' N Pak ensured the shares wouldn ' t pass to Mr. Bilzerian by winning the emergency federal court order . The original order barred him from completing purchases of Pay ' N Pak shares made Tuesday or Wednesday ; yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pay ' N Pak shares . No matter how Mr. Bilzerian chooses to continue the fight , he appears to be forced to tender his shares by tomorrow morning ' s deadline or risk receiving less attractive compensation for the stake . Under the buyout group ' s complex two-stage tender procedure for the $212. 5 million bid , shareholders have a strong incentive to tender their stock right away . The company ' s emergence as the object of a pitched battle remains something of a mystery , given its modest recent performance and low corporate profile . For the year ended Feb. 28 , Pay ' N Pak had net income of $5. 7 million , or 57 cents a share , down 30% from the previous year . Analysts have blamed the profit drop on an industry slowdown , and project the company will see current-year earnings rebound to $10 million to $12 million . In the fiscal first quarter ended May 31 , Pay ' N Pak earned $4. 4 million , or 44 cents a share , up sharply from $2. 3 million , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $115. 4 million , up 9. 8% from $105. 1 million . Pay ' N Pak shares , which closed yesterday at $20. 875 , off 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , were trading at just over $13 a share until they jumped when Mr. Bilzerian disclosed his interest in the company in a March 27 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . In recent years , Mr. Bilzerian has been well rewarded for selling to competing suitors his stakes in concerns that he had put in play . In recent years , he has made a reported $40 million by making losing bids for Cluett , Peabody &; Co . , Allied Stores Corp. and Hammermill Paper Co . To some extent , he apparently will be able to add Pay ' N Pak ' s name to that list if he tenders his shares to the management group . Mr. Bilzerian ' s filings indicate he bought most of his holding at less than $13. 50 a share . But his pursuit of the retail chain this time failed to spark competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher.  --  - John Knowlton contributed to this article .
