Another antiabortion setback <P> With gaudy antiabortion posters set up in the normally staid Senate chamber , Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and his conservative allies pressed for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the historic 1973 Supreme Court decision ( Roe vs . Wade ) that guarantees women a constitutional right to abortion . " The country is on a slippery slope to infanticide , " warned Senator Jeremiah Denton of Alabama . " Even dogs have more protection than the unborn , " said Hatch . But after two days of speeches in a largely empty Senate chamber , the ten-word Hatch amendment fell 18 votes short of the required two-thirds majority last week and failed by two votes to muster even a simple majority . <P> This was the second recent setback for the pro-life movement . Three weeks ago , a series of Supreme Court rulings solidly supported a woman 's right to have an abortion . Said Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon , a leader of the pro-choice forces : " This is the end of any serious effort " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation pushed by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina outlawing abortion . This bill faces a Senate filibuster and serious trouble in the House . Even if it passed Congress , it would face problems in the courts . Nonetheless , notes Senator William Armstrong of Colorado , who supports antiabortion measures , " This issue is not going to go away . " <P> &lt;CENTER&gt; ? ? ? &lt;/CENTER&gt; <P> Surgeon General Everett Koop has announced the Administration 's revision of the " Baby Doe " regulations governing some 6,800 hospitals that receive federal funds . Now they must post notices at nurses ' stations on each pediatric , maternity and nursery floor stating that failure to give handicapped infants essentially the same quality of care as the nonhandicapped is illegal . The regulations were prompted by a Bloomington , Ind. , case last year , when a child born with Down 's syndrome was denied surgery and nourishment , and died . In April , a federal judge struck down the original Health and Human Services Department regulations that called for signs in public areas ; the new version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals would see them . Koop maintains that the failure of hospitals to feed and care for disabled newborns is more widespread than commonly believed . But pediatricians generally regard the latest formulation as a police-type measure . The American Academy of Pediatrics was making plans to fight the new regulations in the courts .
