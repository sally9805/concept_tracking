HARD CASH FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME <P> In Missouri , if crime does not pay , criminals will . Twenty-six dollars to be exact . Under a state law that went into effect last month , any person convicted of any crime is automatically required to pay $26 into a crime-victim compensation fund . The curious amount , which includes $1 to defray the court 's collecting expenses , was chosen because it was considered a debt to society that almost any criminal could afford to pay . Supporters of the measure estimate that approximately $250,000 will be raised annually . Crime victims and survivors can collect a maximum of $10,000 for hospital bills not covered by insurance or for loss of income , although payments will not begin until 1983 to allow the fund to accumulate . More than half the states now have programs to compensate crime victims , and the idea had been bandied about in Missouri for four years . But it did not get anywhere until supporters heard that Pennsylvania , like a dozen other states , was raising the money for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sort of " sock-it-to-the-criminal " idea is likely to spread beyond the Show Me state . <P> <P> THERE GOES THE JUDGE <P> Judge Constantine P. ( Dick ) Lantz , 47 , was all set for his inauguration as president of the American Judges Association , a nationwide organization of city , county , state and federal judges . The newest Supreme Court Justice , Sandra Day O'Connor , had accepted his invitation to swear him in . But three days before the ceremony , several newspaper stories reported that Lantz had been reprimanded last October for judicial misconduct by Florida 's Judicial Qualifications Commission ; their action and a $3,000 fine was upheld by a unanimous vote of the state supreme court . In a plea bargain that got 13 charges against him reduced to four , a teary-eyed Lantz admitted that while on the bench , he " was guilty of arrogance and failed to exhibit patience , courtesy and dignity to litigants . " He had also been accused of such judicial peccadillos as eating and talking on the telephone while presiding in court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to solicit a campaign contribution from a Miami lawyer who practiced frequently in his court , nor did he refute another charge that he granted a $10,700 legal fee to a friend after the man had withdrawn as an attorney in the case . When this news broke , Justice O'Connor suddenly developed a " calendar conflict , " and on the eve of the A.J.A. ceremony two weeks ago , Lantz announced his resignation because " the adverse publicity would interfere with my effectiveness as president . " But a question remains . How come a man who had been rated the worst local judge in a 1980 poll of the Dade County Bar Association was elected to the A.J.A. 's top spot in the first place ? <P> <P> NOW , PATIENT RECALLS ? <P>
