 | When the University of Cincinnati Film Society screened Jean-Luc Godard 's controversial movie " Hail Mary " last year , it played to sold-out audiences . Off campus , however , reaction was decidedly unenthusiastic . The French film 's portrayal of the Virgin Mary as the daughter of a gas-station owner infuriated some of the city 's Christians . Angry residents picketed the campus and wrote letters to newspapers demanding to know : " What are they teaching those kids ? " University officials refused to censure their students and insisted that the school was n't warping young minds . " What city residents did n't know , " says UC spokesman Greg Hand , " is that the average age of the students in our film society is 33 . " College town is turning gray . A new study by the College Board has found that 6 million students ? 45 percent of the nation 's undergraduate and graduate enrollment ? are at least 25 years old . Within 10 years the study projects that older students could constitute a majority on campus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day care is now a faculty and student issue . Registrars design flexible course schedules to accommodate full-time jobs . And older students are at once more grateful and less passive : it 's hard to talk about in loco parentis , when half of the freshman class have children . The adult-student trend has been felt most strongly on academia 's bottom line . Women 's colleges spotted the opportunity early . Smith , for instance , started to recruit older students 10 years ago when women 's colleges began losing prospective students to campuses that were going coed . Other schools now depend on the adult market for their survival in the postbaby-boom era . When its enrollment fell by 13 percent in the early 1980s , the University of Cincinnati lost about $10 million in tuition revenue and faced a potential loss of $8 million in state aid . The school actively sought older students ? they now account for 37 percent of the enrollment ? and the financial hemorrhage stopped . This phenomenon is not confined to schools looking for life preservers . Brown , Amherst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Consortium for the Education of Non-Traditional Students ( CENTS ) to attract older students and their dollars . Colleges have mastered the marketing game ? they fill education supplements in local newspapers with come-hither ads ? but that 's only the first step . Some schools are also trying to meet the special needs of older students . The University of California , Santa Cruz , for instance , had funds to care for only about 65 children of its students . As an alternative , Santa Cruz created an innovative parent-locater program , which allows children 's schools to reach a parent anywhere on campus at almost a moment 's notice . Other schools now keep their administrative offices open later and offer a better selection of classes in the evening and on weekends . And Northeastern University in Boston has gone on the road , offering classes at 14 different locations around Massachusetts . " We make the faculty move , not the students , " says John Jordan , dean of Northeastern 's parttime program . Many older students concede they must make some adjustments of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know how to study and what you learned in high school is now obsolete , " recalls Alicia Dillon , 57 , who recently graduated cum laude from the California State University , Chico . She overcame her insecurity by attending meetings of a support group for returning adults . At Memphis State , adults can make the transition to campus life in a specially designed mini-college where they start with just one or two courses . Grade obsessed : Once they regain self-confidence , adult students can help rejuvenate even tenured faculty . At the University of Cincinnati , professors report that their grown-up pupils tend to be active and independent-minded ? and as grade obsessed as any premed . When teachers fail to meet adult expectations , older students may loudly proclaim their rights as consumers . " It costs too much to participate in higher education to treat it as a lark , " says Jerold Apps , professor of adult education at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . Students of all ages share one problem : high costs . Some adults have turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal law , such aid is now treated as taxable income . Until recently , students who were enrolled less than half time ( usually adult part-timers ) did n't qualify for most government grants and loans . Congress has amended those rules and , beginning next year , will allow schools to dole out some financial aid to the part-timers too . " The definition of a college student and what it means to go to college will continue to change , " predicts Ernest Boyer , president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . And the evidence is all around . Consider 51-year-old Dorothye LaGrange . Last year she roomed with her son Vince while both studied at Indiana University . In Chicago next week , Olga Skala , 75 , and her nephew Gary Mielak , 45 , will march together through graduation ceremonies for Mundelein College 's adult program . Then there is 68-year-old Irving Weiner .
