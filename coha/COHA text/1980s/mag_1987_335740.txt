If the fractious globe allows it , Ronald Reagan may spend his final months in power less as a swashbuckler than as a teacher , looking back and extracting lessons from his considerable experience . His " Economic Bill of Rights " speech , delivered on the third of July at the Jefferson Memorial , was a summary of the passions expended in his stewardship and a call to the faithful to carry the banner beyond him . <P> From his years as a dinner speaker for General Electric , Reagan has been a master of the art of exhortation . Indeed , the day before he journeyed to the Tidal Basin to stand beneath the bronze statue of Jefferson , the President told his Cabinet , " The mashed-potato circuit is still out there , and I may be right back on it . " So why not start now , while he still commands the world 's airwaves and has his jet to get him around ? <P> Reagan 's address on economic rights was mostly a burnishing of the ideas he has carried throughout his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Big Government , high taxes , regulation . He still wants an amendment to the Constitution mandating a balanced federal budget and a law providing line-item veto power for the President . He would require Congress to muster more than a mere majority to impose tax increases . " Taxation beyond a certain level becomes servitude , " Reagan declared . He brandished once again the " truth in spending " scheme that would compel Congress to assign a cost to any new program  --  and then pay for it either by cutting other obligations or raising new revenues . <P> At best America will listen with only half an ear , especially when summer ends and the din of the presidential campaign starts to grow . Reagan knows this , but half an ear or even less is better than most recent Presidents have been able to command in their waning days . Time will tell if events permit Reagan to become a pedagogue . He has other pet subjects for discourse , such as the War Powers Act , which gives modern Presidents so many fits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Executive 's power in his last years . <P> Reagan 's pilgrimage to the feet of Jefferson was a bit of a sacrilege . Jefferson hated political speeches . He also thought it was unwise to hang around the swamps of Washington in the summer . Despite criticism , the Virginian paid long visits to Monticello , where both air and mind were clearer . Yet there is a resonance now between Jefferson 's warnings and Reagan 's present-day fears of a Government so big and costly that it ultimately breaks America 's spirit . <P> " We 're still Jefferson 's children , " Reagan told his audience wilting in muggy heat . " Freedom is not created by Government , nor is it a gift from those in political power . It is , in fact , secured , more than anything else , by limitations placed on those in Government . " <P> No , there was not that much new in Reagan 's before-the-Fourth oration . But artful recasting of unvarying basic themes is what got Reagan into the White House in the first place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . More important than novelty is the virtue in his suggestions .
