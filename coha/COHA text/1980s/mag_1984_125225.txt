The boy 's name is Harry Vega . He 's only 18 and diminutive by any standards  --  at 4 ' 11 " , 98 pounds , small even for a jockey . Save for a rou 's mustache , he still looks the child , with a face that would turn the heads of Menudo fans . " He 's just gorgeous , " says Lauren Ayoub , 24 , a woman jockey at Aqueduct racetrack. // For most of the past four years , Harry has lived with the Corderos , Angel and Santa and their two children , Tommy and Merly , in their modest red-brick house in Queens . The Cordero house is located between Aqueduct and Belmont Park ; Santa calls it " a Spanish hotel . " Lauren , like Harry , has recently been living there . Jorge Velasquez stayed with the Corderos for months when he first came up from Panama , by way of New Jersey , in the ' 60s . Besides jockeys , the Corderos regularly put up agents and stable hands , relatives and trainers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentry and the proletariat rub so close and so wrong . // But , surely , no one in the stream of guests to Casa Cordero ever meant so much to the host as Vega , who arrived there with his mother when he was 13 , a child in every way , though brave enough , it seemed , to want to ride a racehorse . Vega 's father had faded from his life , and his mother has since returned to Puerto Rico , and so the Corderos have become his family . Riding has become his life . // A couple of years ago Cordero sent Vega to a farm near Lexington , Ky. , where Cordero 's friend Oscar Dishman Jr . taught the boy to ride . Last summer a trainer at Hazel Park in Detroit took Vega by the heel and , for the first time , tossed him into a saddle when the paddock judge cried , " Riders up ! " A month later , on Oct. 11 , Harry broke his maiden at Hazel Park , and Cordero bade Vega come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him everything this side of genes . The Corderos are a racing family , but Angel 's only son , Tommy , is too big to be a jockey . Instead , he 's a jockeys ' agent . // Nights , Harry would sit with Cordero in the trophy room , watching films of races , talking riding , talking horses , talking horse people , talking Anglos . Harry would listen as the old jock instructed him , encouraged him , corrected him , bringing him along , shaping a future for him . After a while , Cordero even got Tommy to take the boy 's book  --  to be his agent . Someday , Cordero thought , Harry could be a real race rider . Harry was already a rider , but someday he could be a race rider , like Cordero , the best of that breed . // In the Puerto Rico racing encyclopedia , a whole page is required to list all the jockeys with the surname of Cordero , and there 's also a long list of riders named Hernandez , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maternal name is usually appended to the surname , but Angel Tmas Cordero Jr . wanted to be known by his father 's name . And even today , a decade after Angel Cordero Sr. 's death , his son retains the Jr. , which lengthens his name just a hair too much for a racetrack program , so he must be listed not in capitals but in uppercase and lowercase : // JORGE VELASQUEZ Angel Cordero , Jr . DECLAN MURPHY HARRY VEGA // Junior is also what Cordero 's friends most often call him . So does Santa , who 's so named because she was born on Good Friday ( Viernes santo ) . But when Santa or Spanish-speaking acquaintances refer to Cordero by his given name , it is always as Angel , spoken as Gene Autry says the word and never as On-hell , which is the Spanish pronunciation and the name Cordero grew up hearing in the wooden house where the family lived next to the Las Monjas track in San Juan . Like a vaudevillian 's child born in a trunk , Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world outside of racing existed . // Angel Sr. never pretended to his son that racing was glamorous . The father had ventured onto the New England circuit in the ' 40s , without success . Junior can recall his father visiting him in New York shortly after Angel Jr . began to make a mark there , in the ' 60s . They were on the backside at Belmont one morning when a horse came galloping by , with a wizened old Hispanic riding . Junior was struck by the old man 's face . " Poppy , " he said , " he looks just like you . " // " He should , " his father replied . " He 's your grandfather . " That Cordero , whom Angel Jr . had never met , was 70 and still exercising horses . // The father never pushed his son to be a jockey ; instead , he pointedly questioned Junior 's manhood and encouraged him to stay in school and become a doctor . The first pony Junior had was a skinny old nag that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he fed the pony so well that Liberace grew strong , and the little boy grew fearful of him  --  so his father sold him , which made Junior cry . // A few months before he turned 18 , Cordero was riding at San Juan 's El Comandante track when he came round a turn in the pack and there was a spill in front of him ; the horses and jockeys started tumbling , like so much popcorn . Cordero was the luckiest of the riders who fell ; a horse stepped on his helmet , cutting his forehead . Four other jockeys were seriously injured . One had a broken neck . Cordero shivered at the prospect of getting back up , and in the next two races , he took his horse safely wide of the field . // After that , his father stormed into the jocks ' room and grabbed Junior by the silks , as you might a stable cat by the scruff of the neck . " Tu no va ser jinete ms porque tu tienes miedo ! " he screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause you 're scared ! " And then Angel Sr. personally took his boy off the rest of his mounts and sent him home . For four days Junior brooded , pondering his courage , until one morning he returned to the track and said he was ready to ride again . Before long , other riders were castigating him for riding so dangerously , but Cordero only laughed at them . One day he took a huge horse on the lead , and he had too much animal at the first turn . Out of control , he tried to pull the horse around , but the horse crossed his forelegs , broke one and threw his jockey . Cordero was kicked along for a full furlong , first one horse 's hooves picking him up and dribbling him , then another 's . He broke two ribs and got a U stamped on his back where a horse stepped on him , but he came back soon enough . No one has ever seen him scared again . // Yet there is an ambivalence to this little man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enters , a walking fiesta , but it 's been suggested that he 'll try to unseat other jocks  --  drop them , in racetrack vernacular . And while he is the consummate horseman , a trainer in silks , he has been accused of endangering horses if it served his purpose . He is the happiest of men , and his house is a racing salon , but yet , says a trainer who uses him often , " The day Junior stops riding he 'll have to pay to get in , because then he 'll find he ai n't got a friend here . " Cordero is respected for riding every race , no matter how cheap , all out , yet he was fingered in a massive race-fixing scheme . Some fans think that he 's worse than a bum , that he 's a thief . Last year he made more than $1 million , and in both 1982 and ' 83 he won the Eclipse Award as the finest jockey in the land , but he still looks bitterly upon American racing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little colored kid . " Cordero never merely rides to win , he rides to beat . // Cordero is n't like Wayne Gretzky , say , or Martina Navratilova , who by sheer ability tower over their rivals . No , Cordero is n't just an athlete ; he is a blend of talent and personality woven into a presence that dominates every scene he appears in . If it 's a big race but he has n't got the big horse , somehow Cordero will cause controversy . If he has a contender , he will seek to choreograph the action . As a friend , I trainer Frank Martin , once observed , " If it 's a 12-horse field , Angel wants to ride 13 horses . " // In New York , where he rides almost exclusively , Cordero sets the tone of the sport almost single-handedly . People say Moses Malone dominates the boards , Goose Gossage an inning , Carl Lewis a meet , but Cordero is a force , and wherever he rides , things happen . " All I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainers , " is that when Angel goes , the whole face of New York racing is going to change . " // All of it flows with one jockey ? // " You got it . " // And that , of course , could happen anytime now , because when a jockey is 41 , as Cordero is , a bad fall could retire him . Cordero has no sense of that himself  --  indeed , he exhibits an air of invulnerability and durability  --  and many of his forebears have ridden much longer . But more important , as Santa says , " Riding horses is the pleasure of his life . " The Corderos ride . // When Junior won his second Kentucky Derby , on Bold Forbes in 76 , he requisitioned the blanket of roses . He had won the Derby with Cannonade two years before , but this one meant more to him because the trainer , Laz Barrera , and the owner , Estaban Rodriguez Tizol , were both Latin . Cordero brought the Derby roses to the cemetery in Queens and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Belmont to ride Monday 's card . // In February , Cordero thought that Vega was really starting to blossom , and he got mad at Tommy for not getting Vega enough good mounts . Finally , Cordero fired his own flesh and blood on Vega 's behalf . " Tommy 's kinda lazy , " he said , and he made his own agent , Frank Sanabria , take Harry 's book . // Sanabria , who 's Cordero 's brother-in-law , had been an agent for such top riders as Jose Amy and Jacinto Vasquez before he signed on with his sister 's husband four years ago . Sanabria was Cordero 's second choice . Junior first offered the job to Santa , who 's a fine handicapper , but she turned it down . " For Spanish men , the way they were brought up and with their egos  --  especially Angel 's ego  --  J knew it would have turned into a war with us , " she explains . So , Sanabria got the book , and here Cordero was now , ordering him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // An agent , you see , can only represent one journeyman jockey at a time , though he 's allowed to work for an apprentice on the side . Not surprisingly , this arrangement does n't always enthrall the journeyman ; it 's rather like expecting the old wife to tolerate her husband 's young girl friend . But now , here was Cordero telling Sanabria to cut into his time , because he loved Vega like a son and believed in him . // Cordero even told Sanabria to lean on his regular clients , and when Angel could n't ride one of their horses , the agent was to try and get them to use Vega . So , sure enough , Vega began to get more mounts , and he began to win more . // This particular Wednesday in March , Ash Wednesday , Vega and Cordero rode an entry in the fifth race at Aqueduct . Vega had another horse in the eighth , and in the ninth he would be up on a 15-1 outsider named Not Tired Tonight . Cordero himself had mounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his day 's work with a win on Jacque 's Tip , by a head over Startop 's Ace , ridden by Jean-Luc Samyn . It was a stakes win , worth $43,860 to the winner , made all the sweeter in that Samyn claimed foul and the stewards disallowed it . Cordero despises Samyn and longs for an excuse to bust him one in the chops. // So Cordero took his shower , washed the ashes off his forehead and was carrying on in the jocks ' room when the ninth race went off . Cordero paused to watch it on the monitor there , looking especially for Vega . However , Not Too Tired was far back , out of camera view , when she ducked her head , and the race caller said there had been a spill in the back and that a bug boy , Harry Vega , was lying on the track . // The question of exactly how good Cordero is has often been overshadowed by the tumult he creates . To illustrate : Cordero says he was once fired by a trainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins in a two-week period , because the owner said he was embarrassed by all the furor attached to the jockey . Although he finally got the Eclipse Awards , there were other years when Cordero was slighted because the balloters refused to look past the man to the rider . And there are some who claim that the qualification rules for the admission of jockeys to the Hall of Fame in Saratoga have been changed to keep Cordero out . One of his most persistent critics , Kent Hollingsworth , the editor of The Blood-Horse , has celebrated Cordero as " capable of turning in the finest riding performance of any jockey since Gilpatrick "  --  a fabled 19th-century rider  --  but Hollingsworth has also accused Cordero of doing " irresponsible things which endanger other horses and riders . " // No other jockey in the land ranks with Cordero and Laffit Pincay . Pincay is the stronger , Cordero the better athlete . Pincay is more stable and reliable , Cordero capable of flights of genius ( or , sometimes , whimsy ) . Pincay is four years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger body , because he heals so quickly and because he does n't have Pincay 's constant weight problem . While Vince DeGregory , an agent who has represented both jockeys at one time or another , marvels that Pincay can ride at all ( " He should be 150 pounds " ) , Cordero  --  the word means lamb in Spanish  --  eats pretty much what he pleases , blithely watching his weight bounce up and down between 108 and 114 . His evening meal , which the maid places on the table the instant he walks into the house , probably consists of more than poor Pincay consumes in a week : meat , rice and beans , vegetables , salad , bread and fried bananas , plus all the fixings . // Eddie Arcaro had the same metabolism and , they say , could win a lot of races in the jocks ' room merely by making a show of gorging on snacks between races . It is Arcaro that Cordero is so often compared to  --  as a competitor and strategist and for his ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race rider  --  if sometimes to a fault . You hear of a basketball or football player being a coach on the field ; well , Junior is a handicapper in the saddle . Watch one of his races carefully with binoculars , and you might well see Cordero , if he 's near the lead , casually sneaking peeks back , not because he 's checking up on a rival but simply because he 's curious about what the rest of the gang is up to . // Since Cordero is n't a mellow , contemplative sort , it is n't surprising that he had difficulty in his early years holding a horse in check , rating him . He wanted to be on top , waving his bat like a cavalry saber , making anyone think twice before challenging him . Velasquez recalls that Cordero would brood all day when he knew that he had to rate a strong horse who wanted to run right out of the gate . // Cordero is impulsive and fidgety . He can not carry on a conversation for more than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . He darts when he walks , and speaks rat-a-tat-tat in three languages , Spanish , English and racetrack . When he eats , he slashes at his food , even tearing a benign item like a salad apart limb from limb . When Cordero merely kisses someone , for God 's sake , as when he greets his son , even that 's conducted as though he 's making a quick move at the eighth pole . // And , from what we know about horses , they seem to sense what the rider feels . " When you 're in a bad mood , a horse can tell , " Sanabria says . " When you 're nervous , they can feel it . Junior is just good at getting along with horses . " Indeed , he even finds out whether the personnel at a stable speak English or Spanish , so he can cluck sweet nothings to his mount in the right language . // Learning to be another sort of person in the saddle may have been the most difficult challenge in Cordero 's education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his signature comes after the race , when he is free to dismount and be himself again . Most top jockeys are known by their riding styles , but Cordero is distinguished for the way he leaves a horse . He pops off as if from a trampoline , bounding high , arms wide , smiling broadly . As a concession to a middle-aged back , he does n't perform these spectacular dismounts regularly anymore , but they 're there when needed , like the suddenly statuesque Reggie Jackson , gazing fondly after a memorable home run . One afternoon a few years ago in the paddock at Belmont , a big , unschooled 2-year-old suddenly bucked Cordero off . He hurtled through the air , twisted properly , landed nimbly on his feet , and , smiling all the while , pounced forward and leaped back on the startled animal . // Cordero paced about the jockeys ' room , waiting anxiously , until he heard the diagnosis : Vega had a broken collarbone . Cordero cursed creatively at the kid 's bad luck , that he should get hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't overdramatize it . To jockeys , broken collarbones are like tennis elbows at Wimbledon : occupational hazards . Besides , Tommy had rushed out to Franklin General Hospital to be with the kid . There was nothing Cordero could do , so he piled into his monstrous white Cadillac and zipped over to the house . After dinner , he would drive to the hospital and bring Vega back home . // Cordero dived into his dinner the way he always does . He was still fuming at Samyn , and that helped to put Vega out of mind . They had scuffled before , and now , Cordero explained , savaging an avocado , they must surely clash again , because , he asserted , Samyn kept making picayune foul claims against him  --  like the one in the feature today . // " I tell you , never fight on the track , " Cordero said . " Even I 'm not that dumb . You fight on the track , where the people can see you , they give you days , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you got ta wait till you get in the jocks ' room , and then you make sure you get the first blow , because there 's always enough people around , they jump in right away and break it up ' fore the other guy , he can hit back . Then , hey , when the fight 's over , keep swingin ' , because this is no prizefight , no official . Just because they break it up do n't mean it 's over . And for that , you gon na pay $350 , so you might as well get one more good shot , hey ? So next time , Jean-Luc , he do n't start the fight , I pay $350 fine , and he pay $350 to fix his nose ! And I do n't get days ! " And he cackled at the thought and asked for more meat . // The phone rang and he sprang up in mid-bite . Whatever Cordero is doing , the alternative is instantly more attractive . " Yes ? " he snapped . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He what ? " Cordero hollered . Oh yes , he screamed that out , and even with his brown face the color was gone . His eyes flashed over the room , here and there , showing fear , anger , desperation . Then he slammed down the phone , and for a moment Angel Cordero was still . // " Jesus Christ , " he said softly . " They say Harry 's neck is broken .... He 's paralyzed . " And then there was a long pause . " He 's just a boy . " // Then he clutched his belly and went into the bathroom and threw up . // It would n't be fair to say that trouble follows Cordero . It 's more the other way around . Most recently , for example , a woman groom in Saratoga brought an assault charge against him , saying he threw a bat and glove at her in a backstretch softball game ( let 's not even get into that one ) . Even his greatest triumphs are invariably besmirched . In 1974 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the throng on the infield pressing along the rail , many jockeys took an outside path . But Cordero , on Cannonade , a horse not given much of a chance , stepped through on the rail , survived two bumpings , won from 14 lengths back , and then , with lan , Cordero plucked a rose and presented it to Princess Margaret , who was there for the centennial . Woody Stephens , Cannonade 's trainer , says , " Nobody ever rode a better race than Angel Cordero rode the ' 74 Derby . " But would n't you know , shortly afterward it was revealed that Cordero was " saving " with two other jocks  --  meaning they had agreed to split their purse money with each other . // In the larcenous world of the racetrack , this is one of the least heinous practices , but as it later turned out , Cordero would be accused of race-fixing during that period ( 1972-75 ) . In 1978 Tony Ciulla , an admitted fixer , charged that Cordero and several other jocks fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing was ever proved against Cordero , although the State Racing and Wagering Board , which took testimony from 10 jockeys , including Cordero , characterized the riders ' statements as " incredible and patently unbelievable . " Cordero , who stoutly maintains his innocence , says he is still amazed that a gangster 's word would be so readily accepted by so many . // But then , perhaps no jockey has ever been in trouble so consistently  --  he has drawn more than 200 fines and suspensions in 20 years . We have n't got all day , so here 's a Cordero sampler : // The ' 78 Travers . Cordero is up on some muskrat named Shake Shake Shake in what 's essentially another head-to-head duel between Affirmed and Alydar . Cordero 's mount drifts out , carrying Affirmed wide and opening a hole on the rail for Alydar and Velasquez . Pincay on Affirmed hurriedly tries to cut off Alydar at the pass , fouling him . Affirmed 's trainer , Barrera , Cordero 's great friend , strongly intimates that Cordero had ridden so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmont . Cordero gets Ronnie Franklin , the inexperienced rider of Spectacular Bid , so scared that it costs Bid the Triple Crown . Franklin tries to run away from a Cordero long shot ( which is to say , from Cordero ) . Earlier in the week , Cordero had slammed his mount into a Franklin filly and then punched the kid in the jocks ' room , the culmination of a series of confrontations highlighted by Franklin publicly calling Cordero a " spic. " // The ' 80 Preakness . Cordero , on Codex , comes down the Pimlico stretch herding and , it seemed to some nitpickers , whipping America 's sweetheart , Genuine Risk , the first filly in 65 years to win the Kentucky Derby . The reverberations from his Preakness ride got so nasty that after a while Cordero began to throw away , unopened , all mail written in a female hand . " I did n't know there were so many bad women , " Cordero says devilishly . " The words they used . " // The ' 81 season at Aqueduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequent sojourns out of town to discover that a polite bug boy , Richard Migliore , has been stealing his thunder . So , first day back , Cordero boasts to everybody  --  even to the pony boys , on the way to the gate  --  that he 's going to show the new kid on the block " what race riding is all about . " Immediately he slams his mount into Migliore 's , prompting DeBonis , the trainer of Migliore 's horse , to call him " the dirtiest rider in the game . " Cordero got seven days , but not one rider would confirm to the stewards Cordero 's loud prerace threats . // The ' 83 Marlboro . On Slew O ' Gold , a possible Horse of The Year , Cordero herds his main rival , Bates Motel , outside , allowing Highland Blade to cruise to victory . " It really did n't cost me the race , because my horse wound up hanging , " says Chris McCarron , Bates Motel 's jockey . " But it cost Angel the race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own horse . " // The ' 83 Belmont . Cordero is on Slew O ' Gold , and he 's worried about Caveat , Pincay up . So he forces another horse over , which closes a hole Pincay is trying to drive through . Caveat bounced off the rail and won , but the horse was never raced again . Sometime later , Stephens , Caveat 's trainer , spotted Cordero and marched over to him . // " Angel , " Stephens said , " I was a raggety boy , and I came out of Kentucky the same way you were a raggety boy who came out of Puerto Rico . The horses did everything for me , and they did everything for you , and I never hurt a horse . But you steered my horse into a fence and ruined him . " // And then Stephens walked away . // Cordero is hurt by that kind of talk , and , in fact , a number of horsemen will defend him against such charges . They write off incidents of the Caveat kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the way he handles his own mounts . " Sure , he 'll get mad at a horse if it do n't try , " DeBonis says . " He 'll lather a cheating horse real good  --  but Angel 's never vicious to horses . " Also , Cordero has a reputation for winning with sore horses , giving them his tender best . People still remember an especially touching scene in a 1973 race at Gulfstream . Cordero 's mount , Stretch Turn , collapsed on the far turn . Cordero lay there , next to the horse , massaging the animal 's heart , until the vet arrived and told him it was too late , the poor thing was dead . // " I love horses , " Cordero says . " Horses are like pets to me . When I was a little boy , I grew up with toy horses , and when I 'm through riding , I 'm going to train horses . So horses will be my whole life . There ai n't nobody on the racetrack loves horses more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they all look the same . But I can look at a picture of the horse , just his face , and I can probably tell you this horse . People ca n't believe it . I 'm out at the track in the morning , and a horse will come by , and I 'll say , ' Hey , ai n't that the filly I beat at a mile the other day ? ' And they 'll say , ' Angel , how did you know that ? ' Most jockeys , even if they rode a horse , they do n't remember him . No , you ca n't say I would hurt a horse . Not ever . " // It was revealing . Cordero 's language is usually peppered with the familiar vulgarities . But the whole time he talked about horses , and how much he loved them , not once did he utter a coarse word . // Cordero 's two-legged colleagues may not speak of him quite so gently , but none will say publicly that the man is a dirty rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing , sometimes careless but never malicious . Of course , it all depends on what you mean by race riding . // " He rides very rough , " says Pincay . " I got mad at him a lot of times . Very mad . I think I am going to kill him . Then , when I get back to the jocks ' room , he comes over and says ' ' scuse me , ' and I just have to forget about it . " // Cordero 's infectious personality  --  when you consider his ferocious professional conduct  --  is as disarming as it is baffling . In a jocks ' room he is constantly joking , laughing , teasing , singing , second-guessing , showboating , screaming scatological suggestions . And he 's known for helping respectful young riders ; McCarron calls him " an inspiration " for newcomers to the profession . But Cordero also brooks no challenge to his position , and some jockeys are alleged to have left New York rather than be under his thumb . Steven Crist has written in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the fundamentals of handicapping ; thoroughbred bettors consider speed , class , form , pace , weight , track condition , post position , appearance , weight  --  and Cordero. " // To the stable cognoscenti , much of Cordero 's power comes from the indulgences he can bestow on lesser riders  --  what are known as " second calls . " A top rider like Cordero , especially one so facile at buttering up the right trainers and owners , may have more than one offer to ride in a given race . So Sanabria , the agent , will accept one and , in effect , take options on the others , agreeing to ride them only if his first choice is scratched . Cordero is so in demand that trainers will yield to his whims in one race in order to earn his favor in some future race . // So , the whispers run , when Cordero leans on a trainer to pass along one of his second calls to a Cordero-approved rider , that jockey is in Junior 's debt and  --  human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where bets are cashed  --  perhaps he wo n't ride quite so hard against Cordero as he would against other jockeys . This charge infuriates Cordero , although he wo n't deny that he holds a certain sway over most of his rivals . // " The guy who messes around with me is  --   --  crazy , " he says , " because I 've got eight  --   --  horses a day , and maybe he 's only got four , and chances are my horses are a lot better . So maybe he 's only got one real good  --   --  chance to win , and he sure do n't want to have to worry in that race about me messing around with him . Now , understand , I 'm not going to scare anyhow , and if he goes after me off the  --   --  track , that 's one thing . But if he tries to keep me close on the track , let me know he 's there , box me , herd me , chase me on the  --   --  lead when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , O.K. , that 's O.K. , that 's just race riding . " // Cordero sat low in the Cadillac . The big car thrust forward ; it would n't be rated . In this part of residential Queens , some of the streets have grass dividers , with one lane on either side . A car in front of Cordero 's would n't go fast enough for him , so he pulled the Cadillac out , drove across the divider and then dashed down the other lane , in the wrong direction , changing leads at the last instant , yanking the Caddy back into the right lane at the intersection . // He found Franklin General , ditched the car in a no-parking spot and strode in . Cordero never seemed so tall . He marched to the elevator , banged the down button again and again , delivering imprecations you ca n't imagine , now pounding the damn button , slugging the sonofabitch , yelling at it , kicking the door , and , when the elevator finally delivered him to the Emergency Room floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who recognized him ) and found the bed where Vega lay , his head strapped down to keep it still . // Tommy was sitting there with Vega , his eyes damp .

Merly came with a friend . Santa , who was dining at a nearby restaurant , was notified , and she arrived , too . Victor Lopez , another bug boy who had ridden in the race in which Vega went down , was next to arrive . And there was a thoughtful young valet named John Schaffer . When Sanabria got the news and called , Cordero broke down and began to cry on the phone as he told Sanabria that Vega had a broken neck . // In the E.R. at that time were a little boy with a small bump on his head and a teenager with a fractured wrist , but here was Harry , paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be all right , after all . Then one more fellow burst in , clutching his chest where he 'd been stabbed . // The special said : " I 'm here four nights a week . The jock seems like a nice boy .

Weekends I go over to Aqueduct and forget all this . " There was still a smudge in the middle of his forehead where the priest had touched him with ashes that morning , when Harry Vega was out galloping horses . // The considerable Hispanic influence upon racing in the U.S. was only beginning to be felt in 1962 when Cordero arrived in New York , with no contacts , unable to speak the language , so naive that he once fell for a street-corner offer to buy a $20 share in the Empire State Building . He fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only 41 mounts and a single winner . // That September he married Santa , his second cousin . She came from racing stock , too , and they had a lot in common .

" He was a helpless child  --  a cute , helpless child  --  but only for his career did he have any confidence . " // Even when Cordero came back to New York in 1965 and began to enjoy a certain amount of success , he despaired and almost quit . Eddie Belmonte , another Puerto Rican jock , found Cordero at the airport and brought him back . Santa applied more subtle pressures . " Angel is very knowledgeable in racing , " she explains , " but as a man  --  a Spanish man  --  he only knows how to give orders . " // But it was n't just the horses that nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a sport that has traditionally been inhospitable to blacks , save those carrying feed pails , Cordero was n't only a bean-eater , he was a nigger , as well . // Discrimination was new to him , and he was unprepared for it . Even now , the bitterness surfaces . Asked about Declan Murphy , a hot apprentice at New York tracks , Cordero says , " He 'll always do better than he should because he 's blond and blue-eyed . " ( And he likes Murphy , too . ) A leading trainer has said of Cordero , " It 's not for his black face that I wo n't ride him . It 's for his black heart . " // A good many Hispanic jocks ride in New York , but there is no question that the worst racial slurs are reserved for Cordero . He laughs now and , exaggerating a little , says that he was called " a little black m  --   --  " so often while he was still unsure of his English that he actually began answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only that old standby but also " monkey " and references to his rice and beans diet and to his alleged race fixing are regularly screamed out at the racetracks , in the vilest language . Cordero is so accustomed to death threats that he has asked not to be advised of them . He merely assumes another threat has been made when he notices cops escorting him in the paddock . " The Spanish people are worse than the Americans , " Cordero says with equanimity . " They all want to play macho man . " // It 's also true that , because there is no Puerto Rican hero today on the order of a Clemente or a Cepeda , Cordero casts a long shadow for puertorriqueos everywhere . There was even a pop song , recorded by Ismael Rivera in 1970 , entitled Eddie y Junior , for Belmonte and Cordero . But while Cordero is proud of his heritage , he rarely goes back to the island and views himself as a New Yorker . " I feel like I 'm the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to California , it seems , but I 'll stick here . " // After all , it has been almost 20 years since he and Santa , with the infant Tommy , set up house in the States . Merly ( named , not unlike they might name a horse , by combining the two first syllables of her grandmothers ' names , Mercedes and Lydia ) was born in New York . Both children speak their parents ' native tongue only grudgingly , and abominably . The Corderos still live in the same house they moved into in 1968 . The neighborhood was predominantly Jewish then ; now it 's working-class black . What matters to Cordero is that it 's only 15 minutes from his horses . // Because , as Velasquez puts it , Cordero is " shy and timid " in crowds not composed of racing people , he rarely ventures into what residents of Queens call " the city "  --  Manhattan . If anything , the more famous Cordero gets , the more insular he becomes . The only new adventure in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays it with horsemen . " Horses , " says Santa . " He does n't talk about much else . Horses , that 's all Angel lives for . Horse people  --  that 's his circle . Horses are his life . " // His house is a racing museum . Oh , here and there graduation and first communion portraits may be spotted amid the cups and trophies , the Peb drawings , the bronzed mementos , the two Eclipse Awards . Now that he has won them , been certified the best , people ask him , Junior , what next ? You make a million a year , you 're the epitome of your craft , but here you are in your 40s , every day enduring calumny and vitriol , every day risking life and limb . What more is there ? // Well , if it 's Wednesday , it 's the first race Thursday  --  $12,000 claiming , 3-year-old maiden fillies , six furlongs . Or , if it 's Thursday , it 's the first race Friday . And so on . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over in the corner bed , Vega still lay with tape pulled down on either side of his head . " The filly ducked her head , " Vega said , " and the more I pulled , the more she pulled down , and then I came over her . " He paused . " Maybe if I was as good as Angel .... " Then his voice trailed off , and Cordero walked away , shaking . // " A horse gon na do that , and it do n't matter who you are , " Cordero said . That kind of risk exists every time a trainer lifts a jockey up  --  almost 2,000 times a year in Cordero 's case . " Harry 's just a boy . He do n't know how to fall . Me , my body  --  I 'm little , but I 'm grown . I know . " // Composed again , Cordero walked back to see Vega , to see his surrogate son , who had only ridden six months . It was hard to believe , but this face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filly ducked , be the only thing that worked ; it would be perched for a lifetime on top of a body that would shrivel and go slack . Cordero began to worry about what he would say to Harry 's mother in Puerto Rico . He wondered what he could tell her about what horses had done to the boy he 'd made a jockey . // The neurosurgeon arrived , a tweed coat over his greens , and he studied the X rays for a long time , wrinkling his nose , before he shooed everybody away from Vega 's bed and pulled the curtains around it . // When he came away a few minutes later , the tape had been removed from Vega 's head , and the neurosurgeon told everybody that the first doctor had made a mistake . Vega did n't have a broken neck , after all . He only had a broken collarbone , like jockeys everywhere , all the time .
