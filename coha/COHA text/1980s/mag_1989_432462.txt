 | Diana Kennedy celebrated the publication of her new Mexican cookbook by greeting friends and fans beside an All Souls ' Day altar to the dead . Erected at the Mexican Consulate in New York , the altar bore gaudy marzipan skulls , shiny loaves of pan de muertos bread for the dead ) and a tiny paper coffin with miniature bones inside . Another author might have found such a setting morbid , but Kennedy understands All Souls ' Day the way Mexicans do : it 's a time for people to get together and feast . And for Kennedy , who once braved tropical storms and a rattletrap-taxi ride hoping to breakfast on a special yard-long tamal , any occasion marked by good food is a fiesta . Kennedy has long been recognized as the world 's leading authority on Mexican food , and her new book , " The Art of Mexican Cooking " ( 526 pages . Bantam. $24.95 ) , is an exhilarating guide to some of the favorite dishes of her adopted land . These are not the familiar tacos and enchiladas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this sort of quasi-Mexican cooking is " misrepresentational . " Kennedy 's passion is for the authentic food of Mexico 's different regions , and she ferrets it out in towns and villages , homes and restaurants throughout the country . " She is a scholar and an anthropologist , " says Jose Prud'homme , chef at New York 's Cinco de Mayo restaurant , who prepared the sophisticated hors d'oeuvres for her reception at the consulate . " She 's read everything about Mexican food , books that go back to the 1800s , and if she says something is so , you know it 's right . " Born and raised in Britain , Kennedy moved to Mexico in 1957 to marry Paul Kennedy , a New York Times correspondent based there , and spent the better part of a decade studying the food that had come to fascinate her . After her husband 's death in 1967 , she went to work on her groundbreaking book , " The Cuisines of Mexico . " Published in 1972 , it quickly became a bible for serious devotees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a revised edition was published three years ago . Today she spends most of her time on a hillside on the outskirts of a village called San Francisco Coatepec de Morelos , about three hours ' drive from Mexico City , where she runs an unofficial , thoroughly idiosyncratic research center dedicated to Mexican cooking and ecological living . Quinta Diana , as she calls her home , is a seven-acre organic farm that provides Kennedy with nearly everything she needs : she grows 24 varieties of fruit , 22 herbs and 16 vegetables as well as coffee beans and chilies . Her kitchen and bathrooms operate on rainwater ; eggs and milk come from her own chickens and cows . She also keeps bees , and distributes jars of homemade honey to tradespeople and repairmen with the savvy of a local politician doling out highway-construction contracts . Her kitchen equipment ranges from the traditional to the pragmatic : she considers a mortar and pestle made of volcanic rock " indispensable , " but she likes her electric ice-cream maker too , and she keeps a cordless phone handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tending the cows . Kennedy is feisty and quick-witted ? qualities that help her negotiate the daily complications of life in Mexico . Driving around in her yellow pickup truck with " Quinta Diana " painted on the side , for instance , she is an obvious target for any corrupt policeman looking for a little extra cash . " I always travel with my tape recorder on the seat next to me , " she says . " If a cop stops me , I grab the recorder , hold it up to the window , make a fuss of turning it on and then say , Yes , officer , is something the matter ? ' Works like a charm . " Tortilla factory : Her readers have to be quick-witted , too . Kennedy 's books are among the most demanding and uncompromising a home cook will ever pick up : her idea of a shortcut in making tamales , for instance , is to find a tortilla factory ( " they are dotted all over the country now , " she writes blithely ) and ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she advises , would be to prepare the flour yourself using dried hominy and calcium oxide . ) Her new book includes a list of sources for Mexican spices , flours , herbs , banana leaves and the like , and Kennedy wants that list to be used . " If you ca n't get the ingredients , forget it , " she says . Journalists who are lucky enough to try Kennedy 's food when she herself is the cook are unanimous in their rapture , but reports from other kitchens are mixed . Kennedy subtitles her book " Traditional Mexican Cooking for Aficionados , " and , indeed , it 's cooks who are already well steeped in the culinary culture of Mexico who seem to get the best results from her recipes . Others may find even the simplest dishes maddening to try , for the directions are brief and assume a great deal of kitchen expertise . Insufficient testing in American kitchens may account for some of the problems encountered in the book : the dessert syrup she says to serve cool becomes so thick and taffylike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sauce she describes as scant and slightly gelatinous is just plain soupy . Perhaps the best way for most people to enjoy " The Art of Mexican Cooking " is as literature , for Kennedy is an engaging writer and her culinary travels make good reading . Just bring home a taco , curl up and feast with your eyes . @#
