A red flag against a black wall . An elegant carpet . A sturdy table with two chairs on each side . On the table is a cigarette box and ashtray , matches . Two other chairs downstage on each side . Morning light . A deep bell tolls . Pecdov stands in the light , at ease , relentlessly cheerful . Marya sits . She is terrified , trying not to show it . PECDOV Stalin , dead . Difficult to believe . Hard to grasp . ( He mimes closing a window . The bell is shut out . He turns to marya . ) It is about ten pages long . Divided into many sections . A poem . We do n't know the title . MARYA I see . PECDOV It is about a woman standing in front of a prison . MARYA I see . PECDOV She is waiting . MARYA I see . PECDOV ( Smiling . ) Please say something beside " I see . " You sound pedantic . MARYA I 'm sorry . PECDOV Such poems , given out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Unwritten . To be assembled . The existence of this one is alarming . Why ? We 'll see . ( Pause . He stares at her a moment , smiling . ) Well , old woman , standing in line . Thinking , probably , poetic thoughts . Anything wrong with that ? p. 3 MARYA If her thoughts are a danger to the state , yes . PECDOV How could they be ? Some old bag of bones ? But then , another woman becomes involved . She is also standing in the prison line . What does she say ? MARYA How should I know ? PECDOV Guess . MARYA How the old women could threaten the state ? PECDOV That 's better . MARYA They know something . State secrets ? PECDOV They have no knowledge of anything about the government . Try again . MARYA One old woman is the poet ? PECDOV Brilliant . MARYA And the other is like the reader . Audience . You and me . PECDOV You are capable of marvels . MARYA They have made someone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like a cigarette ? MARYA No , thank you . PECDOV Do you mind if I smoke ? MARYA Please do . p. 4 PECDOV Well , maybe I wo n't ( He does n't smoke . ) Try again . Personal life . Husband , say . MARYA The poet is married to the wrong person . PECDOV She was once but he died . You 're getting close . MARYA She is accusing someone of something . PECDOV Stay where you were . Not marriage , but what comes next ? MARYA Children ? PECDOV Children . Exactly . This old woman , well , maybe not so old as I 've made out , late forties , let 's say , and in an oriental sort of way , quite handsome  --  she has a child . In the prison . MARYA Oh . ( Pause . ) Akhmatova . PECDOV Good for you . ( Smiling . ) Ever met her ? MARYA You know I have . PECDOV I 'm glad we 're being straightforward with each other . One of the women in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , ten pages of poetry , saying we know not what , and at the very end , something overwhelming . Stupendous . But that 's all we know . Ever meet Gumilev , her son ? MARYA After he was in prison . p. 5 PECDOV The first time ? That was in the thirties . MARYA When I was a child . PECDOV Set free to fight in the Army . War over , his grateful nation puts him in prison again . In and out and in , like that . I wonder why ? MARYA His mother . PECDOV Um , and out of her son 's tragedy she makes yet another poem , possibly treason . Poets are persistent , I 'll say that for them . Now what ? ( Pause . ) Do you like this room ? It has always been used for these polite discussions . One of my predecessors , years ago , had Turgenev here . He was a young man then . So handsome , enormous shocks of hair . So rich . Mama 's enormous hunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a story . Do you know what he was told ? Right here ? MARYA No . PECDOV Given a brandy first . A Minister of Culture , no doubt quite like me , congratulated him . " Welcome , Ivan Sergeevich , to Russian letters ! " " Thank you . " There was a moment : Turgenev waiting to hear what was to be cut from his story , and the Minister like me waiting to strike to the heart of the matter . Which he did . MARYA I see . PECDOV ( Quickly . ) You see ? p. 6 MARYA I beg your pardon ! I do n't see ! What happened then ? PECDOV Turgenev finally blurted out , " Well , come now ! What do you want cut ? " Would you call that rude ? MARYA Uh , yes . PECDOV I would n't . He asked an honest question . He got an honest answer . " We do n't want to change a word of what you have written , " said the man like me . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You see ? ( Pause . ) Do you have any idea of what I 'm saying ? MARYA Not quite , no . PECDOV Well . We sit here in this same room , almost a century later , and I am saying the same thing , this time about a woman who stood in a line in front of a prison and then did n't write down a poem about it . Whatever that is , I want to break its spirit , but I do n't know what that spirit is , or what it says . I only know who possesses it . MARYA Akhmatova . PECDOV But why should I call you in , someone who knows her only slightly ? MARYA You know I know her very well . PECDOV Yes , I do know that . But still , why ? To ask you what she wrote ? MARYA To ask if it threatens you . p. 7 PECDOV Absolutely , and not just in the spirit . A real threat , in revolutionary terms . You love your country , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything to hurt her , would you ? MARYA Never . PECDOV Do you think Akhmatova would ? MARYA No , I do n't . PECDOV How do you know ? MARYA Her patriotic poems mean they say . She wrote poems in praise of Stalin , too . PECDOV I know she wrote them and I know why and it was n't for the love of Comrade Stalin . It was to keep her son from being executed . At the end of this poem , there is something else . What ? Do n't know . But whatever it is , people weep at the thought of it . So moved , they give Akhmatova money . Food . They help her live . What is it ? MARYA I do n't know . ( Pause . ) PECDOV In her early poems there are always lovers . Lovers , lovers . Zhdanov called her half nun , half whore . Do you know many writers like that ? MARYA I know many writers who would like to be like that . PECDOV Artistic wit is so delicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna Akhmatova is a relic of the Russian past . Living on , because of a talent , gift , yes , remarkable , for writing artistic ditties . Impressive as verse , perhaps : accurate , specific , surprising , melodious in her blunt way , sticking in the mind . But what is it about ? Personal superiority , that 's what it 's about ! ! Nostalgia for a childhood in the city of the Tsars , and how beautiful were the pine trees ! Young lieutenants committing suicide ! Great artists , mysterious doubles ! All this bunk steaming in the rotten fumes of sick Christian mysticism , and the stink of Great Art . What could be worse for a Working People than a self-absorbed Nun/Whore Artiste ! Our Soviet children , studying her in school ? Today ? Unthinkable ! Stalin would get right out of his coffin . ( Smile . ) But I am always ready to learn . ( Pause . ) Who is the other woman in her poem ? p. 8 MARYA I do n't know . PECDOV I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the poem and who is the old woman at the beginning . You say you do n't know . Can you anticipate the next question ? MARYA No . PECDOV Simple . Have you read the poem ? But , wait , I have n't asked you yet . I do n't want to , because then if you say you have n't , we face real difficulties . I have n't asked you anything yet . Nothing can be done to you yet . All right ? MARYA Yes . PECDOV You 're shaking . You 've said nothing wrong . You are a valued worker , a teacher , respected by your students . However , once I ask you that question , then  --  we 're in the soup . Your job , husband , children and so on . Do I have to ask ? ( Long pause . ) MARYA She gave me five words to remember . And I know the title . Requiem . PECDOV Requiem ? ( Laughs . ) Not for Stalin , that 's certain . For her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five words ? MARYA That 's all . PECDOV Do you expect me to believe that ? MARYA It 's the truth ! p. 9 PECDOV Why only five words ? MARYA I do n't know . Maybe she did n't trust me . PECDOV What are the five words ? MARYA River . Cows . Doves . Rain . Statue . PECDOV What ? MARYA Key words , maybe . I think for the ending of the poem , but she did n't say that . PECDOV This is all you have to tell me ? MARYA It 's all I know . PECDOV Statue . Whose ? MARYA I do n't know that , either . PECDOV Statue , statue . There is no statue in front of that prison . MARYA I did n't think so . PECDOV What else ? What else ? MARYA Anna Andreyevna told me nothing else . I swear it . PECDOV ( Smiling . ) I see . Wait outside , with the others . MARYA You 're smiling . PECDOV I begin my day with joy , and end it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait outside . ( Exit Marya , as fast as she can . ) Hm . ( Blackout . Lights up on Pecdov with Rudinsky , a man in shabby , worn clothes . ) You 'll have to do better than that ! p. 10 RUDINSKY He just wo n't talk about his mother . PECDOV But does he know about it ? RUDINSKY You mean her poem ? PECDOV No , the end of the world . Sit down ! RUDINSKY You mean her poem ? PECDOV ( Sighs . ) God damn it . RUDINSKY Forgive me , but I have been given very peculiar instructions ! Go to prison ! Get to know a man ! Find out about his mother ! I am performing this duty to the very best of my ability but I ca n't threaten him ! I ca n't work him over ! I ca n't get at him ! God damn it yourself ! I beg your pardon . PECDOV Frustrated , are you ? Have to know why you are doing what you are doing ? ( Pause . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night dinner with Beria , Bulganin , Khrushchev , and Malenkov . A purge was on . At the top . At the very top . Put it together . Well ? Well ? RUDINSKY ( Aghast . ) They murdered Stalin ? PECDOV It 's possible . Cerebral hemorrhages can be brought about . Now , a rising Minister of Culture , in my position , does what ? RUDINSKY Something threatening none of them . p. 11 PECDOV Of course , but what ? RUDINSKY Nothing ? PECDOV Fatal . It would be like I was waiting . RUDINSKY Some  --  ah  --  useful activity ? Involving some general security ? Like that ? PECDOV Maybe . One of them will take over , but who ? Everything is in the whirlwind . Anything can happen . Even a revolution , a real one this time . Zhdanov always said Anna Akhmatova was a traitor . Now she is writing an invisible poem about prisons and old women with endings that make people weep . What could it mean ? RUDINSKY My God , another revolution ? PECDOV Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RUDINSKY He knows she writes about him . But he does n't know what . PECDOV Does he still hate his mother ? RUDINSKY Well , some . She farmed him out to his grandmother . She was a poet instead of a mother . He remembers her with bitterness . I did get that out of him . PECDOV Did you tell him Stalin is dead ? RUDINSKY Yesterday . He wo n't talk to me at all now . PECDOV Did he believe something would happen upon the death of Stalin ? p. 12 RUDINSKY I think so . PECDOV Did he say anything about any specific poem ? With something overwhelming at the end of it ? RUDINSKY No . ( Long pause . ) PECDOV Ah ! Damn ! RUDINSKY I did the best I could . With my hands tied behind my back ! PECDOV I know that . Wait outside . ( Pecdov shakes hands with Rudinsky , claps him on the back . Exit Rudinsky . Blackout . Light on Pedcov and Klarina , a well dressed woman in her forties . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds . ) And the title of it , evidently , is " Requiem . " What I need to find out is what happens at the end of it . KLARINA ( Paces . ) And you think I can find out ? PECDOV You of all people . Do you understand why ? KLARINA Because she loved me , and does n't know what I did to her . PECDOV ( Smiles . ) Yes . Anna Andreyevna was so popular . The plainest people loved her steamy little verses , and I 'll admit it , her . Stalin is dead . I want you to put those two things together ? Can you ? p. 13 KLARINA No . PECDOV My dear woman , our great , vast , enormous land , our Soviet Russia , never had a revolution . Not a real one . Powers shifted . The backbone similarities between our government and the Russia of the Tsars are too obvious to need comment . We changed , yes , but not like France , or America . The thought of a truly popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who might bring it about must be dealt with . Now Stalin is gone . The one man who made a real revolution unthinkable is dead . And it is thinkable now . ( He stares at her . ) Are you all right ? KLARINA Yes . I have a headache . PECDOV Four popular artists . Friends . Mandelstam , Marina Tsvetaeva , Pasternak , Akhmatova . Only she survived . Why ? KLARINA She is a great poet . PECDOV Of a sort , maybe . KLARINA People love the poems . Half Russia recites Akhmatova . PECDOV Good . Defend her . KLARINA She refused to emigrate . She wrote passionately about staying with her country . She wrote a war poem praising Stalin . PECDOV All right . Mandelstam , labor camp . Tsvetaeva , suicide . Pasternak , muzzled . But Akhmatova remains , cooking up some deadly invisible opus called Requiem , of what , we may well ask ! Do you follow me ? p. 14 KLARINA A revolution after Stalin ? That 's very doubtful . We loved Stalin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course we did ! But a group begins now . Establishes something . Keeps on . In a year , five ? I want you to talk to her again . KLARINA ( Paces . ) You ca n't ask me to do that . PECDOV Why not ? KLARINA When she stood outside the prison walls , in those awful lines , she had time to think . She knows it was somebody 's idea . PECDOV Which worked very well . KLARINA Do you know why I did that to her ? PECDOV You love your country . KLARINA Yes , but something else . PECDOV She took a man away from you ? KLARINA She is Dante ! PECDOV And you are a Russian patriot . That 's better than being Dante . You will try again . Right now . KLARINA She 's here ? PECDOV In the next room . Waiting , she thinks , to see her son . KLARINA Oh my God . p. 15 PECDOV When she comes in , she will find you here instead . Her friend who put her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have to know ? PECDOV The old woman . That ending . Listen . Troops surround Moscow this instant . Tanks at every crossroad . This city is sealed off , but by an army ready to do God knows what under orders from God knows who ! KLARINA Remember , she had a husband shot ! She has a son in chains ! PECDOV Oh yes , I know that . If Russia faces chaos , who cares ? Here , smoke . If you get nowhere , do n't worry . I 'll be listening . ( Exit Pecdov . Blackout . Lights up on Anna Akhmatova . She has just entered the room . She is staring , stricken , at Klarina . She sinks into a chair . She is a middle aged woman , once a slim , imperious beauty , now growing pleasantly fat . She is a little unkempt , but erect , and self possessed . For many , she is the greatest poet in Russia . ) ANNA Oh . ( She sits in the chair , devastated . Klarina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) KLARINA This is cruel . ANNA Yes . KLARINA I did n't send for you . p. 16 ANNA I believe you . KLARINA I do n't know where your son is , or what is happening to him . Have you heard anything ? ANNA Not in three years . KLARINA You 're looking very  --  ANNA Thanks to you ! ( Pause . ) KLARINA Anna ! ( Pause . ) You 've known , all this time ? ( Anna nods . ) KLARINA It was n't just me , you know ! It was the obvious thing to do to you . Stalin had so much trouble with his own son , when it was suggestsed to him , he said it was the perfect solution . ANNA He was right . You were right . It was . ( Pause . ) KLARINA Well . What are you writing now ? ANNA Poetry in praise of Stalin . KLARINA I mean , anything else ? ANNA Nothing else . KLARINA ( Paces . ) Just tell me , please ? It 's what they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my darling ? ANNA Nothing . p. 17 KLARINA So tell me ! ANNA Nothing . I 've written nothing . KLARINA They know about Requiem . ANNA About what ? KLARINA The old woman standing in line at the prisons . You are writing a poem about her , and it is considered possibly dangerous . ANNA An old woman in a prison line , dangerous ? KLARINA If the old woman is created by Anna Akhmatova , yes ! ANNA Interesting , as always , how your minds work . KLARINA It is your mind and how it works , Anna Andreyevna , they are worrying about ! ANNA You are still beautiful . KLARINA What 's in the poem ? ANNA Men once wasted away for us . KLARINA What overwhelming thing happens at the end of that poem ? ANNA We drove them crazy . KLARINA I am very sorry to tell you that I am not the only one of your friends from the past to betray you ! Others have too ! ANNA Most . The day Zhdanov attacked me , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market . I bought my fish , wrapped in a newspaper . I went home , unwrapped my fish . Newspaper , article , Zhdanov . Death to the poet . My son in prison again . I thought it was you . p. 18 KLARINA God , my head ! ( Enter Marya . ) MARYA Good afternoon . KLARINA You , too ? MARYA Yes . You 're getting nowhere . But stay . ( They sit in the chairs D. , facing Anna . ) MARYA How are you , Anna Andreyevna ? ANNA Well , thank you . MARYA I wish I was . ANNA So do I. MARYA Has Klarina told you what I 've done ? KLARINA No . MARYA I told them what I knew about Requiem . ANNA Oh . MARYA You can imagine why . ANNA Yes . MARYA It was a boy . ANNA So I heard . MARYA They can do to my son what they did to yours . Or worse . ANNA Yes . MARYA So I told them my five words . ANNA I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry on , but different , somehow , and worse . p. 19 ANNA I see . KLARINA They think it is dangerous . MARYA They 're afraid you are writing about something to come after the death of Stalin . KLARINA What happens at the end of Requiem , Anna ? That 's what they have to know ! MARYA They 'll take it out of you , when they want to ! KLARINA They believe us when we say we do n't know what happens ! MARYA But that can change ! KLARINA You know we do n't know ! MARYA We could die ! KLARINA If they do n't find out ! MARYA It 's only a poem ! KLARINA They can shoot us all ! MARYA Your son ! Mine ! KLARINA You have to tell us , Anna ! MARYA You have to tell us something ! ( Pause . ) ANNA I will tell you this . If you love Russia , you can dig for her . MARYA What ? KLARINA Dig ? For something buried ? p. 20 KLARINA AND MARYA Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KLARINA Mandelstam ? MARYA Petersburg ? ANNA I 'm tired now . We had many good times , the three of us . When you were little , Marya , and Klarina loved the voice of God . No more . KLARINA The voice of God ? ANNA That 's what poetry is . You 've forgotten . Goodbye . ( She closes her eyes . ) KLARINA Anna . MARYA Anna . KLARINA AND MARYA Anna ! ( Pause . Anna seems to be asleep . Enter Rudinsky . ) RUDINSKY I 'll wake her up . ( He slams a chair down directly in front of Anna , and sits in it . ) I have been living with your son . In the same cell . He is n't where you think he is . He is here . In Moscow . Maybe five blocks from here . Look at me ! ( Anna keeps her eyes shut . ) I can get to him in an hour . I can tell him things . Imagine . ( Rudinsky gets up , speaks directly into her ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camp til he dies . His mother has used him to write a poem , for which he can be shot ! ( Anna opens her eyes. ) p. 21 ANNA Five blocks ? RUDINSKY Five blocks . ( Satisfied , he sits down again . ) You 've been playing games with your son 's life . ANNA Games ? Do you think , after all these years , waiting to see him again , I would refuse tell you anything on earth ? You silenced me as no other human being who ever lived . Tell me I can see him , and I will tell you anything you ask me . RUDINSKY What happens to the old woman ? What happens at the end of the poem ? That 's what you can tell us ! ANNA All right , but do I see my son ? RUDINSKY I ca n't promise , but yes , probably ! MARYA Anna , you gave me rain , a cow , boats and a statue . Is it the statue ? Of someone  --  revolutionary ? ANNA If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might ! KLARINA Tell us , Anna ! MARYA Please , Anna ! ( Enter Pecdov . He carries a decanter of brandy and two glasses . ) PECDOV " We will meet in Petersburg , around the grave where we buried the sun . " She 'll tell me now . Out . ( Exeunt Marya , Klarina and Rudinsky . Pecdov takes the chair Rudinsky had set in front of Anna and puts it back in place . He pours a brandy and hands it to her . ) Brandy ? p. 22 ANNA Thank you . ( Pecdov pours himself a brandy . ) PECDOV To a statue buried in the tomb of the sun . To your good health . ANNA To yours . ( They sip the brandy . ) PECDOV So . Here we are . ANNA You 've done very well . PECDOV Yes , I have . The faithful disciple . Who sat at the feet of the master poets , with such humility . Such devotion to the great causes , until I discovered the great causes were the great egos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plato said , feeding on the state . So I became a Minister of the People , and slept well at night . ANNA I am glad you sleep well at night . PECDOV Let us go back to Petersburg . To the grave of the sun . ANNA All right . PECDOV I remember it , too . Better than you , perhaps . ( Pecdov closes his eyes and recites , broadly , in the Russian manner . ) " We will meet in Petersburg , around the grave where we buried the sun  --  " ( Anna closes her eyes , and recites . ) ANNA " And then together we will say it for the first time , the wonderful word meaning nothing  --  " ( Both , eyes closed , recite. ) p. 23 PECDOV ( Reciting . ) " In the new Russian night , soft and beautiful darkness , a black velvet nowhere , the beloved eyes of sacred women are still singing , flowers blossom that will live forever  --  ANNA ( Reciting . ) " The city gathers itself like a lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile dashes blindly by , siren whooping like a screaming bird  --  PECDOV ( Reciting . ) " Tonight I will not carry my credentials , I have no fear of the soldiers . I will pray in the new Russian night , for the wonderful word meaning nothing  --  ANNA ( Reciting . ) " For fun we will stand by a fire , maybe time will fall apart , and the beloved hands of sacred women will sweep the ashes back together  --  PECDOV ( Reciting . ) " Do n't worry when the candles all snuff out , in the soft and beautiful darkness , the black nowhere . The bent shoulders of sacred women are still singing  --  PECDOV AND ANNA ( Reciting . ) " You will not see the sun , still burning in the night . " ( Pause . ) PECDOV Mandelstam. p. 24 ANNA Mandelstam . PECDOV And poetry , the voice of God . Do you know how he died ? ANNA No . PECDOV Paranoid in a camp , certain his filthy grub was being poisoned . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat him to death . Great poet of the Russian land . ANNA I am not surprised . PECDOV I denounced him to Stalin . ANNA I am not surprised . PECDOV He read ten of us a poem about Stalin , in which Stalin had cockroach eyebrows , and greasy fingers staining pages of books by men he would kill . It was the single denunciation of Stalin ever written down by anyone , and that one poem did it . Now it is your turn . But you are different . Not as a poet . As a mother . ANNA How ingenious , the Devil . Killing a woman with her son . Mephistopheles , blush . PECDOV I always forget the Christian part of you . The nun within the whore . Never mind Mephistopheles . While Stalin lived , your son was safe . Kept in prison , used to torment you , but not to be killed . Now Stalin is gone , and others will make that decision . Who is the statue that makes people weep ? ( Anna does n't answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking champagne with him in half an hour . Or he can be shot . Not another second . Is there a statue ? p. 25 ANNA Yes . ( Pecdov gets up . ) PECDOV Of someone revolutionary ? ANNA Yes . PECDOV Making Russia weep ? ANNA Yes . PECDOV Who ? ANNA I am the statue . PECDOV What ? ANNA I stand in front of that prison . My metal eyes weep tears . In my poem , I am the statue . PECDOV I do n't understand . ANNA Of course not . PECDOV You have built a statue to yourself ? ANNA Yes . ( Pause . Pecdove laughs , richly and loudly , sits . ) PECDOV Made yourself a monument ? Made yourself an icon ? ANNA ( To him , explaining it . ) I have made a statue of an old woman , standing in a line outside a prison , waiting every day to see her son . In the line are many other women , with sons , daughters , husbands , sisters , mothers and fathers .

Russia can remember me there , if she pleases. p. 26 PECDOV My God ! All this fuss ! Anna Andreyevna , you are not a dangerous revolutionary . You are crazy old woman . ANNA And you are an insect of a single day . ( A long pause . ) PECDOV It 's not his fault your son has a madwoman for a mother . If I make an issue of this , I 'll put myself up for ridicule .

He looks at her . ) ANNA Perhaps . ( Exit Anna . Pecdov stands thinking . He opens the window again . The bell tolls for Stalin . Light fades on Pecdov , thinking. )
