In the tumultuous days of the late 1960s , Abbie Hoffman led the antic wing of the revolution , where the anarchist politics came from Mikhail Bakunin , the media savvy from Marshall McLuhan and the spirit from Peter Pan . He liked to think of himself as a bridge between the New Left and the hippie counterculture , between " Off the pigs ! " and " If it feels good , do it . " He was never more himself than when he taunted the capitalists by showering dollar bills from the visitor 's gallery onto the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange . <P> Hoffman was 52 when he was found dead last week in his small apartment in New Hope , Pa . He was fully dressed under the bedcovers . An autopsy was inconclusive . In recent years , however , he battled depression . An activist to the end , fighting over the environment and Nicaragua , he found the complacent hum of the present no match for the percussive past . <P> Born in Worcester , Mass. , Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went on to graduate work in the headier atmosphere of the University of California , Berkeley . By the mid-1960s , after a stint as a traveling pharmaceutical salesman , he was living among the hippies in New York City and devoting himself to opposing the Viet Nam War . " Personally I always held my flower in a clenched fist , " he once wrote . <P> Hoffman was already 31 when he and Jerry Rubin formed an amalgam of political pranksters into the Youth International Party . " Yippies believe in the violation of every law , " he once told a crowd , " including the law of gravity . " In 1968 they ran a pig for President . As a lead-up to that year 's Democratic Convention in Chicago , they vowed to spike the local water supply with LSD . The schemes were mostly put-ons and fodder for the press , Hoffman 's most faithful co-conspirator . It was revolution as street shtick . <P> Hoffman practiced it more dexterously than anyone else , even as one of the Chicago Eight , the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Seale , who were tried for plotting to disrupt the convention . Hoffman and four others were found guilty of crossing state lines with intent to riot , a conviction later overturned . <P> In 1974 , facing a long sentence on cocaine-sale charges , Hoffman jumped bail . Eventually he settled in a small town in upstate New York , where he took the name Barry Freed and busied himself with environmental issues . When Hoffman came out of hiding in 1980 , on the cusp of the Reagan era , he seemed a bit like Rip Van Winkle , waking up in a new world that was moving not forward but backward into the somnolent 1950s . <P> Hoffman pleaded guilty and served time on lesser charges . Though dismayed by the apolitical younger generation  --  " Never trust anyone under 30 , " he declared  --  he never stopped protesting . It was Timothy Leary , the advance scout of the LSD generation , who eulogized Hoffman most deftly last week . " An American legend , " Leary called him . " Right up there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babe Ruth and crazy Lenny Bruce . "
