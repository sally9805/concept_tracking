They have suddenly become the airline industry 's most surprising partners . Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Texas Air , oversees two carriers  --  Eastern and Continental  --  that are plagued by union strife , deep operating losses and sloppy service . Jan Carlzon , president of Scandinavian Airlines System , pilots a peaceful , profitable , smooth-running fleet . Yet last week the two men shook hands on a deal billed as the industry 's first global alliance among major international carriers . For up to $50 million , SAS will buy a 10% stake in Texas Air and gain greater access to the U.S. market by leasing the rights to three of Continental 's 41 gates at New Jersey 's Newark airport . Each airline will feed passengers into the other 's route systems and share some ground crews and training centers . Said Lorenzo : " It 's an ideal marriage . " <P> As in many marriages , it is a case of opposites attracting . Lorenzo said he was counting on SAS employees to impart their dedication to service to his 70,000 workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air 's cost- cutting techniques as the European airline industry enters a period of deregulation akin to the one that Lorenzo has weathered in the U.S. <P> At week 's end Lorenzo was working on another bold move . Sources close to Texas Air confirmed that both TWA chairman Carl Icahn and New York developer Donald Trump were negotiating with Lorenzo to buy all or part of Eastern . Trump 's particular interest is the shuttle connecting Boston , New York City and Washington .
