It isn ' t that there haven ' t been any women set designers . The late Aline Bernstein was the first woman member of the United Scenic Artists ; but she is better-known for her tempestuous affair with Thomas Wolfe . British-born Tanya Moisewitsch , now in her late 60s , is a giant in the field ; but most of her work has been in London , Stratford , Ont. , and Minneapolis at the Guthrie Theater . Raimonda Gaetani , an Italian designer , made her Broadway debut this season with the ill-fated " Filumena " but up until now has worked exclusively in Europe . Eugene and Franne Lee , the husband-and-wife designing team , have won four Tonys between them ; but significantly , he does the sets while she does the costumes . In this sense , Marjorie Kellogg is a theatrical rarity : a successful young ( 34 ) American ( from Scituate ) female designer on Broadway ( " Da " and " The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas " ) . Over the last 10 years , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , she will be a featured speaker at the New England Theater Conference at Tufts tomorrow . Kellogg ' s career is rooted in her childhood experience at New York ' s fashionable Brearley School , where she and some friends formed a little theater group which presented plays in one of the mothers ' living rooms.Because of a penchant for drawing , the designing chores fell to young Marjorie who remembers her first set done in the 9th grade - a medieval castle for " The Ugly Duckling . " At Vassar , she majored in theater and went on to become an assistant to Ming Cho Lee at the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park . Kellogg comes across as intelligent , sensitive , forthright and very likable . She is reticent about discussing her unique status as the only female designer currently working on Broadway . At first , she dismisses the situation as " a mystery . " But gradually , her feelings begin to surface : " There seems to be a rather subtle , if not subliminal tendency to feel more comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they think women wouldn ' t know how to draw the set properly so that it would stand up - except that has never been a problem . " Are there simply fewer talented female designers around ? " No , I don ' t think so . The way Broadway works , it ' s kind of Catch 22 . They don ' t want to hire you unless they know you can do it and the only way they know you can do it is if you ' ve done a show . " Are women designers treated differently from men ? " You get treated like a little girl and get patted on the head . One of the stereotypical remarks always being made is that women designers can ' t work with stagehands who are considered a rough and tumble group . " The basic reason for the lack of female set designers on Broadway comes down to dollars and cents , says Kellogg . " Very often , producers are reluctant to trust women with a lot of money . And , when you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . You ' re talking about spending $80,000-100,000 on scenery . In fact , David ( Annie ' ) Mitchell just designed a set for $500,000 for Barnum ' ( which opens later this month ) . " According to Kellogg , there are several women working in regional theaters , where the attitudes are " a little less old-fashioned and there is less money on the line . " About her two Broadway hits - " Da " and " Whorehouse " - Kellogg freely admits she snuck in through the back door . Both shows opened off-Broadway , became highly successful , and moved to Broadway . " It was not a question of a Broadway producer coming to me and saying , You want to do this big show ? ' " One thing is clear . Broadway is a tough , lonely , competitive business and Marjorie Kellogg is not about to get much sympathy or support from her colleagues , male or female . " There is nobody at my age and at my level with whom I can compare notes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get work on Broadway look at me and say , Well , what are you complaining about ? ' Male designers kind of sniff and say , We all have problems , dear . ' As far as they ' re concerned , it ' s a miserable business for everybody . "
