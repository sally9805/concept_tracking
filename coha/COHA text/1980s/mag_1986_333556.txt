A chainsaw-carved , life-size wooden elephant was lugged away for $13,000 . A 4-ft. - high red fiber-glass ball called Zargon was snapped up for $2,625 . These were some of the bargains to be found at last week 's auction of sculpture , furniture and potpourri from Expo 86 , the world 's fair held in Vancouver from last May to October . <P> The auction should bring in somewhere between $15 million and $30 million , which will help pay off the fair 's $216 million deficit . Some of that cash will come from Expo 86 officials themselves . Expo Ernie , the stainless-steel and acrylic computerized robot that served as the fair 's mascot , was acquired by Expo President Jim Pattison . Price : $38,100.
