For the past year the Pillsbury Doughboy has not had much reason to let out his giggle . While Pillsbury enjoys strong sales of vegetables , baking products and other grocery items , its restaurant division , including the Burger King chain , has lagged . In the Minneapolis-based company 's most recent fiscal year , earnings plummeted 62% , to $69 million , on revenues of $6.2 billion , as the company closed nearly 100 restaurants and sold its Godfather 's Pizza chain . <P> But Pillsbury still looks appetizing to one investor . Last week Britain 's Grand Metropolitan , a brewing and restaurant giant ( 1987 revenues : $10 billion ) , made a surprise $5.2 billion takeover bid for the Doughboy 's company . Pillsbury is resisting the offer , but at $60 a share , it may be too good for stockholders to refuse . The bid sent Pillsbury stock , which had traded at less than $40 , soaring $18 in one day .                   @ @
