 | After the steep plunge ll oil prices , Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock put his numbers crunchers to work on a fresh look at his state 's finances . What they found is n't likely to please too many Texans : The state expects to come up fiscal $1.3 year . short by the end of its 1987 fiscal year . Texas is n't the only state finding it tough to make ends meet . In dozens of other capitals , politics over the next few months will center on how to deal with unexpectedly lean receipts . Following a big tax cut in 1985 , Minnesota faces a shortfall of $734 million . Kansas is running $130 million behind . Since September , Colorado 's revenue projections have shrunk by $56 million . Louisiana will have to make up a $500 million shortage . Mississippi , which chopped $73 million off spending this year , is worrying about the loss of an added $22 million in energy taxes . Bullock laments : " The days of the big surplus in Texas 's treasury are gone . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " With a few exceptions , states plan to kick budgets back into balance by spending less . In recent months , 14 have trimmed budgets to avert deficits in fiscal years now drawing to a close . More cuts are likely as most governors , in this election year , take up President Reagan 's battle cry : No new taxes . Alabama 's proposed budget slices spending by $500 million . Oklahoma is struggling to cut outlays by $473 million . Illinois may have to trim at least $127 million . Montana needs to lop off $7 million in spending ; " if we have to cut deeper to meet shortfalls , we 'll do it , " vows Governor Ted Schwinden . The 50 states figure to have $3 billion on hand at the end of fiscal 1987 , compared with a surplus of $7 billion at the start of their current fiscal years , reports the National Association of State Budget Officers . States run an overall surplus because , unlike the federal government , most of them are required by law to balance their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cushion may well be the thinnest since the deep recession of 1981-82 . " Surpluses are precariously low in the face of the potential for weakening in the economy and the probability for substantial federal budget cuts , " concludes Gerald Miller , executive director of the budget officers ' group . Busted budgets are unusual after three years of economic growth nationally ? but unusual factors are at work . In many states , the national prosperity is bypassing leading industries , particularly agriculture and energy . Falling farmland values have siphoned $40 billion from Iowa 's tax base since 1981 . Each $1-a-barrel decline in oil prices costs Alaska $150 million , Texas $100 million and Louisiana $31 million . Many states struck by budget woes are in the sun belt , just a few years ago the nation 's economic pacesetter . In another reversal of fortune , the most fiscally fit states are in New England and the Mid-Atlantic region . New York can afford to follow through on a $1.1 billion income-tax cut approved last year . Delaware Governor Michael Castle is recommending $2.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surcharge on income taxes will be allowed to lapse because the budget is once again in the black . To be sure , there are bright spots elsewhere ? Tennessee in the South and California in the West . Even states without immediate budget problems are being cautious . New Jersey 's proposed spending increase of 3 percent is the smallest in 11 years . Massachusetts is holding new outlays below the gain in personal income . Oregon 's spending is just rising at the rate of inflation . Although its budget is back in the black , Michigan plans to spend less this year than last . In Connecticut , Governor William O'Neill is resisting a call by Republican lawmakers for lower taxes . Just a year ago , states were rushing to cut taxes : 14 lowered income taxes , and Connecticut reduced its sales tax on clothing . Chances are high that state coffers will be further drained as the federal government trims its deficits . The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates that President Reagan 's budget for 1987 , if enacted , would reduce aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Lamm calls it " buck-passing without the bucks . " Money would be reduced for just about every federally funded activity ? medicaid , education , mass transit , highways , economic development . Ohio figures to forfeit $664 million in federal funds . Among the $40 million Indiana could lose is $12 million for highways . What 's more , uncertainty about exactly what Congress will do handicaps planning . " We 're scratching our heads , " says Montana Budget Director David Hunter . A handful of the financially healthy states are stashing away money to offset lost federal funds . To help ease the pain , Rhode Island is reserving a portion of a $42 million surplus . Such actions , other officials argue , will just make the states a more tempting target for Washington 's budget ax . " If California squirrels away hundreds of millions of dollars , Congress may view that as proof the cuts can be made , " Finance Director Jesse Huff says . In most cases , states are putting off decisions about how to cope with lost federal aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to find the money to make up for the cuts , " Miller says . Because budgets are tight , the result bfl. of this year 's federal actions could be higher state and local taxes in 1987 ? after elections are over . For now , only a few governors are seeking to relieve fiscal stress with higher taxes . Kansas Governor John Carlin , barred from running  | for re-election , wants to hike his state 's sales tax from 3 percent to 4 percent , raising $190 million . In New Mexico , Governor Toney Anaya and legislators agreed to remedy a revenue shortfall with a $150 million tax increase , including boosts in both sales and income taxes . With tax receipts $27 million light , Idaho is weighing a 1-cent increase in its 4 percent sales tax , generating $20 million . Maine Governor Joseph Brennan 's tax package would bring in an added $8 million . Not seeking re-election , Lamm wants to leave Colorado with a $66 million tax increase , including an added 8 cents on a pack of cigarettes . Stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for better highways could bring higher gasoline taxes in Colorado and several other states . Governor Lamar Alexander envisions crisscrossing Tennessee with a new system of parkways . The 10-year , $1.2 billion scheme would be financed by adding 3 cents to a gasoline tax now at 13 cents a gallon . Virginia 's Governor Gerald Baliles hints he 'll support tacking a penny onto the gasoline tax of 12 cents a gallon to help pay for 799 road projects during the next six years . As usual , the biggest chunks of new spending will go for better schools . In Georgia , an " education-equalization fund " will help improve the quality of instruction in poorer school districts . New Jersey will provide $48 million to help students meet stricter high-school academic standards . The lottery will provide $410 million for education in California ; Missouri 's lottery may help schools to the tune of $86 million . Other spending proposals read like a catalog of the nation 's problems . Seeking re-election , California Governor George Deukmejian is requesting new money for prisons , toxic-waste cleanup , mental-health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Governor Mario Cuomo hopes to hike aid for the homeless by $20 million . Governor John Ashcroft wants $200 million for Missouri 's troubled farmers and $6 million for job training . South Dakota hopes to give $5 million in tax relief to local governments hurt by the sagging farm economy . Maryland will try to come up with $155 million to help depositors in a failed savings and loan . In Rhode Island , funding for prisons will rise 19 percent , including money to hire 100 new guards . Pennsylvania will channel development funds to factory towns with high unemployment . Georgia wants to start . linking such cities as Columbus , Macon and Augusta with superhighways . South Carolina and New Jersey seek to increase funds to discourage teenage pregnancy . States do n't expect to find a quick end to their budget problems . As long as large parts of the economy remain slack , many state officials may well agree with West Virginia Governor Arch Moore : " The state 's budget is balanced ... on the edge of a razor blade .
