Met 's Levine <P> To the Editors : <P> To those of us for whom life without opera is unthinkable , your perceptive story on Maestro James Levine Jan. 17 was welcome . Bravo for your recognition of a brilliant artist . <P> David C. Titus <P> Sea Island , Ga . <P> The greatest of maestros should have proved himself in symphonic music as well as in opera . Levine has not done that . Sir Georg Solti has . If you compare their respective recordings of Mozart 's Don Giovanni , you will discern how superior Solti 's conducting is . <P> Annabelle Farmelant <P> New York City <P> Your story encourages a type of star system in classical music that is deplorable . I could run a season of professional opera on one-tenth of Levine 's salary . As long as there is a Met , opera will remain an oddity , suited to a museum . <P> Henry Rosack , Music Director <P> San Mateo Symphony <P> Palo Alto , Calif . <P> Regarding your description of the Met as the " General Motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West know that it is the San Francisco Opera that is the Rolls-Royce . <P> C. Richard Ogden <P> San Francisco <P> The Met is now a more exciting , more dynamic and richer place under Levine 's direction . <P> Hannah C. Parfitt <P> Lynn , Mass . <P> <P> Begin 's Settlements <P> Begin and his settlers should beware of their scheme to control the West Bank through colonization Jan. 17 . The British tried similar tactics when they imported Scotsmen to Northern Ireland during the early 17th century . The descendants of those settlers have achieved dubious results as we see in Ulster today . Begin 's settlement policy may be creating an evil that will curse the area for generations to come . <P> <P> Robert Webster <P> Levant , Me . <P> <P> By quoting Genesis 17:8 , one of countless biblical passages in which God promises the land of Israel to the Jewish people in perpetuity , you puzzle both Christian and Jewish readers Jan. 17 . How can you quote the Bible and yet scoff at the Israelis for wishing to fulfill God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> <P> Manfred R. Lehmann <P> New York City <P> The quote from Genesis implies that the Jews are the only descendants of Abraham . Abraham 's eldest son was Ishmael , which makes the Arabs his descendants also . The kinship between the Jews and the Arabs , not the animosity , is what should be stressed . <P> <P> Les Gruber <P> Mount Pleasant , Mich . <P> <P> Like most Americans , I loathe any form or expression of bigotry , but I resolutely refuse to defend the modern statesman whose political philosophy is based on the alleged pronouncements of an ancient tribal god . <P> <P> Del Johnson <P> Port Chester , N. Y. <P> <P> If Israel has the funds for a major war , the occupation of Lebanon and the colonization of the West Bank , why does it need so much U.S. aid ? <P> <P> G. Robert DeLong <P> Weston , Mass . <P> <P> You write that in 1948 " the Jews of Palestine seized control of part of the ancient land of their forefathers and established the state of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created in 1948 , after the United Nations agreed to the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state . <P> <P> Anne Pernick
