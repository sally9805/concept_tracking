But the leading forum for adjudicating disputes between nations - the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) - may finally be getting a major test of its effectiveness . At stake is the long-range // credibility of this often criticized , sometimes maligned , legal arm of the United Nations. // There seems to be general agreement - among United States government officials , legal scholars , and those connected with the court - that Nicaragua ' s present claim that the United States supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps the most unusual case the tribunal has ever faced . But consensus ends there. // The case involves internal political and national-security questions in a setting of armed conflict . And for this reason , in part , the US is resisting the ICJ ' s authority even after the court has pronounced that it has jurisdiction in the case. // And if the ICJ , or the World Court ( as it is often referred to ) , ends up deciding the US-Nicaragua dispute , issues regarding not only the appropriateness of the arena , but also the validity of its rules and procedures , its ability to rule on questions of peace and national security , and the composition of the tribunal itself could upstage the outcome of the case. // Set up under the United Nations Charter in 1945 , the ICJ has grappled with a spate of claims over the years , from fishing rights to land disputes .

Two decades later , Canada rebuffed a ruling on marine pollution that could have triggered a dispute with the US . And in the 1970s France rejected an ICJ examination of charges by Australia and New Zealand that French nuclear tests in the Pacific were in violation of international law. // In the Nicaraguan matter , it is the US that has formally challenged the court ' s jurisdiction . ' ' The court is not an appropriate forum to make this type of decision , ' ' says State Department lawyer Patrick Norton . ' ' The UN through the Security Council is. ' ' // Prior to the court ' s pronouncement that it would probe Nicaragua ' s claim in late November , US officials had argued against ICJ jurisdiction in the matter , saying it was a multilateral regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned Nicaragua ' s standing , on the basis that the Central American nation ' ' purposely and deliberately ' ' refused to accept the court ' s compulsory jurisdiction for many decades by failing to file a ratification doctrine. // In deciding to take the case , only one ICJ jurist - the US representative to the court , Judge Stephen M. Schwebel - contested Nicaragua ' s standing . But Judge Schwebel made it unanimous in the final vote favoring the court ' s decision that it had jurisdiction. // Whether or not the US chooses to submit further to court scrutiny of Nicaragua ' s complaint , State Department officials are clearly concerned with the political ramifications. // Some say the composition of the 15-member court is stacked against American interests , with significant communist bloc and third-world representation . But others point out that even America ' s Western friends , including Britain , France , and West Germany , voted against it on jurisdiction in the Nicaraguan matter. // Depending on the ruling , official condemnation by the ICJ of US activities in Nicaragua could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including financial reparations , are not likely , however . The court ' s ruling is binding , but not directly enforceable . It could , however , spur a move within the UN toward censure of US actions . But in this forum the US holds a Security Council veto. // Boycotting or ignoring the court ' s authority in the case could also lead to other problems - including negative domestic and world opinion . Critics point out that the US was highly critical of Iran ' s disregard for ICJ jurisdiction during the hostage crisis. // In the hostage case , the court proceeded to find facts even without the cooperation of Iran ( as it likely will in the Nicaraguan case if the US refuses to participate ) . // The ICJ handed down a six-part decision in May 1980 - six months after the US lodged its complaint - ordering release of the American hostages from the US Embassy in Iran and suggesting that Iran was liable to pay reparations for its actions. // A year later , after the hostages were freed , the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a separate tribunal ( unconnected to the ICJ ) continues , even now , to look at individual and business claims against the Iranian government. // Regardless of how , or when , the Nicaraguan claim is resolved , the matter prods a further look at the role of the International Court of Justice and its effectiveness in keeping peace. // Scholars , government spokesmen , and court officials differ in their intepretations of the value of the ICJ . But most agree that it is a symbol of the quest for peacefully resolving international disputes through the rule of law . The sharpest criticism against it is its lack of clout to enforce its decisions . However , framers of the UN charter seemed to fear that this type of authority could be overused , or abused. // Jeane Kirkpatrick , US ambassador to the UN , described the court as a ' ' semilegal , semijudicial , semipolitical body , which nations sometimes accept and sometimes don ' t.

' ' He singles out the ' ' Soviet Union , Polish , Arab , and third world ' ' nations - all of whom at present have representatives on the 15-member tribunal . A State Department official , who asked not to be identified , says the court ' s authority is greatly diminished if all parties to a dispute don ' t voluntarily agree to its jurisdiction . ' ' The purpose of international law is to settle disputes between governments . Generally it works only when there is a prior agreement to be bound , ' ' he says . This situation , he explains , challenges the credibility of the ICJ and is responsible , in part , for loss of respect for international institutions . Others , however , insist that the court ' s actions and opinions have a very real impact on public opinion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forthcoming otherwise . Richard Gardner , a professor of international law at Columbia University , says that over the years the court has been most effective in law-of-the-sea cases that deal with delimitation of maritime boundaries on the continental shelf . In 1982 , the ICJ reviewed such a dispute between Libya and Tunisia over the Gulf of Gabes . And this past fall it handed down a decision in the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank case - ending a 15-year fishing rights controversy between the US and Canada . While praising the court for its work in the maritime area , Professor Gardner also concedes that it is ' ' least effective in cases that touch the raw nerve of national security . ' ' He quickly adds , however , that the US would be ill-advised to boycott further ICJ proceedings in the Nicaragua matter . ' ' We shouldn ' t underestimate the court of public opinion , ' ' the Columbia professor warns . ' ' We don ' t want to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world . ' ' A flat-out defender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department official who is now serving as a member of the Nicaraguan defense team . ' ' The court is a well-respected judicial organ . Its members are legal scholars in international law . ' ' Professor Chaves stresses that the jurists are bound to interpret treaties and other international agreements . ' ' They don ' t vote their countries directions , ' ' he says . Seymour J. Rubin , executive director of the Washington , D.C.-based American Society of International Law , seems to have mixed feelings about the ICJ . On the one hand , he calls it ' ' a little known body . . . very inactive in international affairs . ' ' Yet , Mr. Rubin too stresses that the court is ' ' not useless ' ' in some matters , especially those where all parties to a dispute agree to adjudication . But Rubin says it must at times acknowledge its limitations and defer to the Security Council - particularly in matters involving peace and security . Over the years , there have been numerous proposals for reform of the ICJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a resolution was adopted in 1974 to strengthen the court . Among the recommendations were : inclusion in all treaties of a provision that would give the court authority over disputes arising from differences in interpretation or application ; acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the court , with as few reservations as possible ; giving greater recourse to the court for advisory opinions from UN organs and specialized agencies . <> <> Current World Court JudgesThe Court consists of 15 judges elected for renewable nine-year terms. * Indicates judge whose term expires on Feb. 5 , 1985. **Indicates newly elected judges .
