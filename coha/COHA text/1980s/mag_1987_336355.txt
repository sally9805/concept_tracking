After a somber and sometimes impassioned debate , the House of Representatives last week voted 243 to 141 to issue a formal apology to the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly sent to resettlement camps in World War II . In addition , the resolution provides $50 million for a fund to educate the public about the detainment program and a controversial $1.2 billion in restitution payments to the approximately 60,000 survivors of the camps . <P> The Senate is expected to approve a similar bill , but opponents say the U.S. can not afford to add such a sum to the huge federal budget deficit . Supporters of the measure say the U.S. is morally indebted to the detainees . Said California Democrat Norman Mineta , whose family was sent to an internment camp in 1942 : " The burden has fallen upon us to right the wrongs of 45 years ago . " But Administration officials note that restitution payments were made to some Japanese Americans after the war , and predict that the President will veto the measure .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
