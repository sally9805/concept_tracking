VIRGINIE : HER TWO LIVES <P> by John Hawkes <P> Harper &; Row ; 215 pages ; $13.95 <P> In a brief preface to his ninth novel , John Hawkes writes : " My subject was , from the start , that wisp of shell-pink space shared equally , I am convinced , by the pornographic narrative ( in color photographs ) and the love lyric , from the troubadours , say , to the present . " He adds that the story first came to him " in a reverie about de Sade . " But the reader who thinks " Boyohboy ! " and curls up with Virginie expecting a spanking good time will be disappointed . Like all of Hawkes ' fiction , including The Blood Oranges and Travesty , this book is thoroughly cerebral ; it uses eroticism to arouse thought . <P> The heroine is an eleven-year-old girl who lives twice and keeps two journals , which set forth , in alternating sections , both of her stories . Virginie 's first narrative takes place in 1740 , the year of the Marquis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the French countryside and serves as a " child accomplice " to Seigneur , whose mission in life is to render women perfect for love and then give them away to other men . He claims the artist 's calling , and then some : " Is it actually not more difficult to work with a woman 's living flesh than to squeeze paint from tubes or chop away at blocks of stone or chunks of wood ? " <P> Seigneur trains five women at a time , subjecting each to a rigorous , never changing schedule of tasks and ordeals . They must make love to a pig and debauch a priest in his confessional . To attain pride , they must calmly watch a tooth being wrenched from the mouth of a horse and accept it , with aplomb , as an unwanted gift . They must undress and embrace a beehive ; they must suffer a butterfly to be slowly tattooed on their backsides . " The regimen of true eroticism is strenuous , " Seigneur reminds one of them . Virginie , the child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> She appears again , somehow reincarnated , in the Paris of 1945 . Her surroundings this time are considerably shabbier than they were back at the chateau , but the activity looks familiar . Her older brother Bocage , a taxi driver , has opened their ailing mother 's house to five prostitutes . Each evening , with Virginie as silent witness , they stage different " charades of love , " sometimes with clients , sometimes with a crippled ex-boxer who hangs around the premises . Like Seigneur two centuries earlier , Bocage arranges entertainments or watches them but never participates.
