As illegal drugs pour across America 's borders , frustrated lawmakers ask an understandable question : Why not unleash the world 's mightiest military machine to tackle the task of protecting the nation from this invasion ? Thus the House earlier this month passed a wondrously simple antidrug amendment that directs the President and Secretary of Defense to " substantially halt " drug smuggling by air and sea within 45 days . The Air Force and Navy would " locate , pursue and seize " all vessels carrying drugs and " arrest their crews . " The military would also provide blanket radar coverage of the entire southern border to detect nighttime flights of contraband . Presto . Pass a bill . Problem solved . <P> Deliberating under the less hallucinatory guidance of Georgia 's Sam Nunn , the Senate approved a more realistic role for the military . The Defense Department would be designated the lead agency for air and sea surveillance of drug carriers and would be required to provide an " appropriate increase " in flying hours for its radar aircraft . Under certain conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Both provisions are amendments to defense authorization bills . The more workable and sensible Senate version is likely to prevail . Nevertheless , it gives to the military a far greater role than it wanted in drug interdiction . The Pentagon , eager to avoid the nasty work altogether , yielded to pressure . from the White House to accept it . One objection : law enforcement is traditionally a civilian function in a democracy . The military also contends that the costs would be high , the peripheral training from the new duties would not be relevant to preparing for war , and the Air Force does not have the right aircraft for the task . Still , Pentagon Spokesman Dan Howard concedes : " We 're prepared to do more . But that requires resources . " Even before knowing just what they will be required to do , some Pentagon officials are floating a scary price tag : $2 billion a year . <P> The military interception capabilities are more effective at sea than in the air . One reason : a smuggling vessel can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Navy to reach , stop and inspect it . But some border-hopping Cessnas can fly to their unloading airstrips and slip out of the U.S. again in half an hour . Even if Air Force radar planes such as the AWACS or E-2C surveillance craft spot the intruders , there is not much time to alert lawmen on the ground , get them to the strip and make arrests before the drug traffickers flee . The cost of keeping an AWACS in the air , moreover , is about $7,500 an hour . <P> For interception , the only Air Force jets with the right type of radar to detect low-flying planes are supersonic ; but if they slow to the 150 m.p.h. of the suspect prop planes , they will be near stalling speed . Even then they could do little but frighten the smugglers . The possibility of downing innocents almost certainly would preclude any shoot-to-kill orders to Air Force pilots . <P> In fact , the U.S. Customs Service and Coast Guard have more effective aircraft for this job ( Black Hawk helicopters and Cessna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better coverage . One other practical tactic : the use of tethered balloons with look-down radar ( called aerostats ) . Seven , already authorized by Congress but not yet operational , could cover the border and part of the Bahamas .
