At the Pump ? ? From Project Free Angola : Activist Manual , distributed by the Young Conservative Foundation as part of its nationwide protest against Gulf Oil for trading with Angola . The foundation , which is based in Washington , employs the tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolent protest in its campaign against companies ( and their university stockholders ) that do business with the Soviet Union and its allies . The group recently led a successful campaign to force Gray &; Company , a Washington public relations firm , to discontinue its lobbying activities on behalf of the government of Angola . the following text outlines the basic procedure for initiating a " Free Angola " campaign . Successful implementation will prepare both you and your community for succeeding levels of escalation on your front of the Private Initiative War Against Moscow . PHASE 1 : SKIRMISHES AT LOCAL GULF STATIONS The opening salvo of your campaign will be directed at local Gulf stations . The object is to persuade the owners to join you in condemning the actions of the parent company . A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner-operated , not leased . 2 . Choose a large station with a high profile in the community . 3 . Check to see if the station has an arrangement with local municipal services , such as the police or fire department . Sympathetic city council members may be persuaded to take their business elsewhere if you can convince them it is unpatriotic to protect their community with vehicles burning communist gasoline . B. STEP 1 : WRITING THE LETTER Your first action will be to write a letter to the owner of the gas station : Dear use proper name , We want to believe your intentions are the best . That 's why we 're informing you of the atrocities your parent company , Gulf/Chevron , is committing , and why we 're giving you an opportunity to distance yourself from these crimes against humanity . Gulf/Chevron currently supplies , through trade , about $580,000,000 a year to the Marxist regime in Angola . The Marxists use these funds in part to pay for the 40,000 Cuban troops they 've hired to carry out a program of genocide against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is currently being fought by Jonas Savimbi and his UNITA forces . The Cuban troops in Angola are the only factor standing between millions of Angolans and freedom ? and Gulf/Chevron is footing the bill for those troops . Gulf/Chevron is underwriting tyranny ... ... and we ca n't believe that you support this morally . To demonstrate your opposition to the violations of human rights being committed in the name of your corporation , we hope you will post an 11 " x 16 " poster , which we will be happy to supply . which reads : " This station does not support the Chevron corporation 's policy of cooperation with the communist regime in Angola . " Unless we are notified of your decision by name a date two weeks in the future , we will be forced to assume that you support Gulf 's funding of genocide , and will include you in our picket . Send the letter by certified mail , then call every three days to check on the owner 's response . By the time you are ready to picket , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . STEP 2 : YOUR NEXT MOVE It is unlikely that the owner will agree to your request . If he does , make sure he posts the aforementioned poster . Take plenty of pictures of the poster in its prominent location . Then , repeat step 1 with your next Gulf station . If the owner does not respond , proceed to step 3 . STEP 3 : THE PICKET Make one sign for every protester . Use slogans like " Gulf gas in your tank = Angolan blood on your hands , " " Gulf loves Communism , " " Boycott Gulf ? They Hate Liberty , " and so on . Every motorist who enters the lot , as well as pedestrians strolling by , should be offered a bumper sticker , a poster , a flier , and a copy of the letter to the station owner . Position two people at every entrance to distribute materials . Have the rest of the protesters march around or in front of the station . Keep walking ; movement creates the illusion of even larger numbers . C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance to coordinate notification of the press . This is crucial , as your effort will largely be wasted if the media have not been notified . D. FOLLOW-UP Naturally , you will continue the protest until the owner agrees to post the poster . Of course , once the first station has met your demands , others will follow suit . As more stations jump on the bandwagon , the publicity and the momentum will bring mounting pressure to bear on the next target of your campaign : the regional cor time , enough to make one point that might put porate headquarters of Gulf/Chevron. his harangue in perspective for the audience . On Campus From briefing materials dis-tributed to participants at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) leadership training seminar , held last summer in College Park , Maryland . Each summer , AIPAC holds training sessions for college students from across the country . The following excerpts suggest responses to campus visits from pro-Palestinian speakers . The document was published in the Journal of Palestine Studies , No. 57 . TIPS FOR LEAFLETS AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar . Pictures can make a boring list come alive ; they can catch the attention of people on the go ; they may just get your leaflets read . Beware of gross propaganda-type pictures of shot-up corpses , etc. , which the other side sometimes uses ; they tend to come off badly and hurt your case more than they help it . 2 . Avoid hysteria , but also avoid too much subtlety . A serious , factual tone is probably most credible , and so best . Remember that the goal of leaflets , as with all propaganda response , is to convince the probably ignorant and bored third parties in the audience . Do not go so far in your passion that you alienate these neutrals. 3 . Either inform or startle or both . You can either try to cram lots of information ( a damaging bio of the speaker , a list of PLO atrocities , etc. ) into your leaflet or go for one big effect : a catchy headline and picture or one somewhat detailed gruesome incident . The trade-offs are that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shock-effect posters . Try one of each , but no more than two or three , total . QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSIONS Question-and-answer sessions are an opportunity to embarrass a bad speaker and at least make your point with a good one . You will never convince the speaker of the rightness of your position ; your target is the audience , and that should always be foremost in your mind . Have your questions prepared in advance . Memorize them ; do not read them . Never lose control . Do not get flustered if the speaker interrupts you ? just keep trying in a calm voice and he will look foolish . Do not expect him to have a heart attack if your question nails him ; at best he will get flustered , but do not be surprised if he twists and turns away . Think of the question as a few seconds of your BAD QUESTIONS ( HOWEVER WELL-MEANT ) 1 . You say all these things about Israel , but is n't the PLO just as bad ? ( Never give them the opportunity to define the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLO terrorists ? ( Never make vague accusations which leave a clever speaker room to evade the issues . Avoid general terms ; wherever possible stick to specifics. )
