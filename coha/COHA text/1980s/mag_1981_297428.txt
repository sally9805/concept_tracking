MEMOIRS OF AN ANTI-SEMITE by Gregor von Rezzori Viking ; 287 pages ; $13.95 <P> These five long stories are connected by a single protagonist and a ruling obsession . They begin with a young boy growing up in the 1920s in northern Rumania . The time is already out of joint for his upper-class parents , who still mourn the death of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and the succeeding decades are to prove even harder on the son . Near the end , he is a bitter old man in Rome , looking back on " half a century-and what a century ! " of chaos and dissolution . Memories alone sustain him , and nearly all of them have to do with Jews . <P> The title of this intricate narrative is technically accurate but also misleading . The self-described " moth-eaten survivor of a bygone splendid world , " who prefers Gregor above his half-dozen other Christian names , carries bigotry as both his birthright and curse . His father " hated Jews , " and the son follows somewhat haltingly down the same path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least liked them less than other fellow human beings . This was as natural as liking cats less than dogs or bedbugs less than bees ; and we amused ourselves by offering the most absurd justifications . " As he idles in Vienna during the late 1930s and watches the gathering power of the Nazis , Gregor is capable of the most appalling judgments : " And if the Jews were frightened , it served them right . It would keep them from becoming Russian spies and propagandists of Communism and also make them behave a little more decently at the Salzburg Festival . " <P> Yet Gregor 's repellent opinions are consistently at odds with his behavior . From childhood on he is drawn to Jews , as both as friends and lovers . In Vienna , he offers to marry one so that she can claim Rumanian citizenship and escape the encircling Nazis . This offer is kindly refused , and she gets out another way . When the war is over , Gregor does marry a Jew , his second wife , and fathers a son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy divorce and custody battles . Years later , the old man tries to convince himself that this death was merciful , that the sad-eyed child would have grown up to be both " himself as a Jew " and a bomb-throwing Maoist . Yet a tactile memory triumphs : " Never will he forget how they walked through a park one winter , and the little boy held out his hand to have the father lead him along ; he gave him his forefinger , and even today , he can still feel the little fist closing around it and clutching it . " <P> The sadness of this moment does not absolve Gregor of his sins , nor does the fact that he knows when he has been beastly . He accurately labels his behavior as such , but his honesty seems disdainful rather than repentant . His soul remains disastrously divided against itself . He can not reconcile what he thinks by rote with what he knows through experience . <P> Yet Author Gregor von Rezzori , 67 , has made it possible to understand this antihero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various cities of residence . It matters little how much of Memoirs of an Anti-Semite may be autobiographical ; the book 's achievement overshadows its origins . These haunting stories portray history unwinding within a single skull , a cultivated , often charming mind being betrayed by a catastrophic flaw .
