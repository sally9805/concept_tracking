The analysis was made by the Urban Institute , an independent research and education organization in Washington , for the Independent Sector , a coalition of 320 leading foundations , corporations and nonprofit organizations . The institute does studies for private organizations and for the Government , from which it receives most of its income. // The institute ' s analysis was based on a computer study using mathematical models developed over more than a decade. // // $18 Billion Drop Predicted // The institute projected a drop of at least $18 billion in donations for 1981 to 1984 to the nation ' s more than 300 , 000 nonprofit groups . The figure represented the difference between a projected total of $228. 1 billion in donations under the former tax laws and a projected total of $209. 8 billion under the Tax Act that President Reagan signed into law Aug. 13. // The losses , the institute ' s report said , will further strain the operation of nonprofit groups , which have been hard hit by reductions in the Federal budget. // A Reagan Administration official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be overcome by additional leadership at the national , state and local levels to encourage people to give or to volunteer their services . The official , Frank Hodsoll , Deputy Assistant to the President , also pointed out that there were provisions in the 1981 Tax Act that should encourage giving , particularly to causes in the inner cities. // He said that the Administration believed that not all programs jeopardized by the Federal budget reductions should be supported by nonprofit groups because some had not proved effective. // The Urban Institute ' s report estimated that the budget cuts and tax legislation , taken together , could mean losses of at least $45 billion for nonprofit groups over four years. // The study was supervised by Lester M. Salamon , a political economist at the institute and former deputy associate director of the Office of Management and Budget , and by Charles T. Clotfelter , Professor of Public Policy Studies at Duke University. // " The outcome is a triple whammy against nonprofit organizations , " said Brian O ' Connell , president of the Washington-based coalition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden of conducting social or cultural programs is being shifted increasingly to private groups by the Government. // " The irony in these developments , " Mr. O ' Connell said , " is that the Administration wants to strengthen the nonprofit sector , but the tax act inavertently undercuts the very organizations the President is counting on. " // Among other findings , the institute concluded that the 1981 tax act was likely to alter significantly not only the size of contributions but also the existing pattern of giving , with the prospect that educational institutions , hospitals and cultural activities would be the most adversely affected . <> <> Burden May Be Shifted // The new legislation , by providing greater reductions to higherbracket taxpayers , is likely to shift the burden of supporting charities more to families with incomes of $6 , 000 to $25 , 000 , the report said. // According to the analysis , the projected adverse effect of the new law on nonprofit groups arises from its lowered tax rates , which reduce the incentive to give . The study said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " whereas people with lower incomes give mainly to religious organizations. // In essence , the " price " of giving is lower for the taxpayer in the higher brackets . Under the previous tax law , for a taxpayer who was in the 70 percent bracket and itemized deductions , a dollar for charity cost only 30 cents , since 70 cents would have gone for Federal taxes anyway. // The new law reduces the tax rate on unearned income , including income from investments , to 50 percent from 70 percent . As a result , the " price " of the dollar for charity is now 50 cents , since 50 cents would go for taxes . The tax act also provides an across-theboard reduction of 25 percent over three years for all taxpayers and reduces the top tax rate on capital gains to 20 percent from 28 percent , which will further increase the " price " of the contributed dollar . <> <> Various Factors Considered // In arriving at the figure of $18 billion , Mr. Salamon said , allowance was made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give more money to charities . The study also took account of the increase in personal income that the Administration contends will result from its economic recovery program. // The analysts also included as a factor in their calculations a provision in the new tax law that permits people who do not itemize their deductions to deduct 25 percent of the first $100 of their charitable giving in 1982 and 1983 . This level would increase to 100 percent by 1986. // The Urban Institute ' s analysis did not consider the potential losses to charities resulting from a provision in the new law that eliminates the inheritance tax for all estates under $600 , 000 . In 1980 , bequests totaling $2. 9 billion were left to charities. // The $18 billion estimate is probably understated , Mr. Salamon said , since the calculation did not consider possible effects from the act ' s provisions on estates , foundations or corporations . <> <> Tough Period Predicted // " Our projections suggest a period of considerable economic stringency and decline for a wide range of private , nonprofit charitable institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some groups would depend in part on a more aggressive fundraising approach to reach lower-@ and middle-income people. // Mr. O ' Connell agreed that the analysis had highlighted " discouraging " developments for nonprofit groups , but added : " Even if we can not counter the decided influence of the tax tables on giving by the wealthy , we probably still have a good chance to appeal to the generosity of the average American. " // For nonprofit groups , the next two or three years are likely to be a period of tough transition , said Michael J. Boskin , professor of economics at Stanford University . Mr. Boskin has predicted that the effect of the new tax laws was likely to be " noticeable but not a calamity . " He maintained that the cutback in Federal support for nonprofit programs in itself might encourage private contributors to give more once they realize their dollars will have more impact now. // The experience of community foundations that handle a large number of trust funds suggests that whereas tax benefits influence some donors , there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Cleveland Foundation. // Herbert B. West , director of the New York Community Trust , which administers more than 500 funds , agreed . He said , " People give to support causes , and some because they are interested in helping and others just want to keep their money out of the hands of relatives. " //
