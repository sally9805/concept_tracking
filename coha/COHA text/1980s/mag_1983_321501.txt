ALL THE RIGHT MOVES <P> Directed by Michael Chapman <P> Screenplay by Michael Kane <P> Everybody 's somebody 's baby , especially when Hollywood goes on a field trip for new stars . Nothing succeeds like last year 's success , and this year the talent scouts came back with Tom Cruise , who looks like a baby-faced Christopher Reeve . Here he is , Superman in miniature ( Reeve is 6 ft. 4 in. , Cruise 5 ft. 9 in. ) : the hooded eyes , the sculpted body , the off-beat comic timing , the self-deprecating manner , the winning smile . Cruise played a psychotic cadet in Taps , a winsome greaser in The Outsiders , but it was in Paul Brickman 's sleek and sexy summer comedy Risky Business that Cruise first turned on the wattage . Star power has translated into box-office dollars : in its first eleven weeks Risky Business earned $56 million , lying Cruise with Michael Keaton ( of the equally successful Mr. Mom ) as a surprise package of 1983 . <P> Now Cruise travels from the Chicago North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appalachian Coal Belt lo play a working-class jock in All the Right Moves . Life here is picturesquely grim . Shanties that look as if they were about to implode perch uneasily on streets set at a San Francisco diagonal . The JUST MARRIED legend on the car of a young bride and groom is scrawled in Polish ; Ihe not-so-happy couple plans to honeymoon in Pittsburgh . The guys al the Ampipe steel mill who have not been laid off probably wish they could be , and Ihe high school football team manages lo blow its big game against an upscale rival . The only escape route for Stefan Djordjevic ( Cruise ) is a college sports scholarship , and his prospects look grim : the coach ( Craig T. Nelson ) thinks Stef has a " bad attitude . " He needs Ihe love of his good woman Lisa ( Lea Thompson ) lo keep him from falling into the slough of his family 's steelworker tradition . <P> The background of All the Right Moves may be gunmetal gray , but the characters and situations are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking kids with big dreams and a bright line of patter . The coach carries on like a sensitive drill sergeant , psyching his team into a football frenzy by using curses , inspirational locker-room speeches and the odd face-mask violation . Michael Chapman , who graduated to the director 's chair with this film after making his name as the cinematographer of Taxi Driver , Raging Bull and Personal Best , brings a virginal intensity to each hoary plot device . He hardly gives his audience time to realize that the football team is only an updated platoon from a 1940s war movie ( the Irishman with his well-fingered rosary , the Italian with his letch for the ladies , the slow Poles and happy blacks ) , or that the big football game follows a scenario that is both predictable and improbable ( with only a few seconds left to play , the coach calls for a hand-off in his own end zone in monsoon mud ) , or that the heroine is called upon to utter lines that Gale Page would have found too naive to speak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
