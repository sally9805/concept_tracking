Pac-Man Finally Meets His Match Feverish competition takes its toll on video-game stocks <P> Over the past several years , almost no business has grown faster than video games , but last week stocks of most of the industry 's highflying participants came crashing down with a thud . Warner Communications , owner of Atari , the king of video games , unexpectedly forecast a slump in fourth-quarter earnings . The news reverberated through Wall Street . Analysts began recalculating profit estimates of the best-known games manufacturers , trying to divine whether the Atari setback had more cosmic implications . By week 's end no one was quite ready to declare that the stock market was flashing a bleak " Game Over " for the popular amusements . But it seemed clear that video-game makers would no longer be able to rack up record profits with the ease of a twelve-year-old joystick junkie who stars at Pac-Man . <P> When investors finished adding up the losses after the stock market closed on Friday , the extent of the devastation was electrifying . The most money was lost on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a runaway elevator-from $54 to $35 , a loss in market valuation of an astounding $1.3 billion . Shares of the other market leader , Mattel Inc. , which makes Intellivision , lost $192 million , fully 40% of their earlier value . <P> Until last week , the only question most people asked about home video games was how fast they would spread . It seemed as if every child in America , and many adults , was interested in buying plastic game cartridges and playing them on consoles ( which typically cost $200 or more ) hooked up to a television set . <P> No one sold the cartridges and the consoles better than Warner 's ten-year-old Atari . By acquiring the rights to popular arcade games like Space Invaders and Pac-Man , and designing them to fit players of its own manufacture , Atari saw its sales leap from $30 million in 1976 to $1.1 billion last year . As late as last summer it still held about 80% of the world market , and in doing so had got a lock on an enormously profitable business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can usually be sold for a retail price of $25 to $50 . <P> Atari 's success quickly lured other competitors . A year ago , Mattel was still the major one , but at least 20 companies have products on store shelves this Christmas . In order to hold on to its market share , Atari spent heavily to promote its new E.T . and Raiders of the Lost Ark games . But sales failed to reach expected levels . <P> Suddenly last week , Consumer Products Division President Perry Odak , 37 , who had been with Atari for only eight months , was ousted . Although his removal was attributed to personality differences , the announcement came the same day as the revised fourth-quarter forecast . Warner now predicts that it will earn only about $4.05 or $4.10 a share this year . While that is an increase of 10% to 15% over 1981 , it is well below analysts ' earlier estimates of as much as $6.63.
