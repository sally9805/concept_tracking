Britain 's " Iron Lady " was on the mend last week . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher underwent an hourlong operation on her right hand to correct Dupuytren 's contracture , a condition in which her pinky was drawn toward the palm . If left untreated , the ailment can cause deformity and loss of use of the hand . <P> Thatcher , who had surgery for a detached retina in 1983 , remains in vigorous overall health . Within hours of the operation she was studying government papers . Said one aide : " Anyone who thinks she 'll cut down her work load does n't know Margaret Thatcher . "
