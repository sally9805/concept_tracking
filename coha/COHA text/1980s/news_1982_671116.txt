Armed Israeli soldiers dropped out of sight as the trucks passed the last Israeli checkpoint here . But Israeli officers dressed as tourists stood by the road and watched the Palestinians roll into Syrian-held territory. // An additional 760 guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization left today by sea for Tartus , Syria , making a total of more than 6 , 400 guerrillas and soldiers who have left west Beirut in the first week of the pullout . That is about half the troops estimated by the Israeli Army to have been trapped in west Beirut a week after the Israelis invaded Lebanon on June 6. // ( A fleet of trucks , buses and cars sped from Damascus to greet the returning guerrillas .

It would be the first visit by a high-level American official since the invasion . Page 4. ) // " We are satisfied with the process of evacuation , " said Col.

" Colonel Ben-Zvi said he expected the withdrawal to be finished by Sept. 4 or 5 , as the Israelis had originally planned and hoped . There will be no withdrawal by land on Saturday , he said , but Syrian Army troops are to leave by the Damascus road , with their tanks and artillery , on Sunday and Monday. // The colonel affirmed that most Israeli anxiety about the willingness of the guerrillas to leave had subsided in recent days as the pullout has proceeded as smoothly as could be expected of such an unusual , if not unprecedented , military operation. // The international monitoring force of 800 American marines , 800 French and 532 Italian troops are now all in their assigned positions to supervise the withdrawal . The Americans patrol the port , where ships full of guerrillas depart ; the French and Italians are stationed at key points on the green line that separates the guerrillas in west Beirut from the Israeli Army in east Beirut. // Before the pullout started , the Israeli Government and Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Palestinians might try to use an international force as a screen , finding a pretext to refuse to leave , and creating a potentially violent crisis , with the monitoring force caught in a crossfire between the trapped guerrillas and the Israeli Army. // Asked today if there was any sign that the P.L.O. was trying to use the international force as a screen or buffer to delay leaving , the colonel said , " Definitely no. " // He emphasized that this was because the Americans , French and Italians are placed in such a way that they could not provide a screen . He declined to elaborate , but it is apparent from observing the international force ' s positions that there are large unguarded gaps through which Israeli forces could move if they wanted to invade west Beirut. // Today ' s departure by land was by the Palestine Liberation Army , which is controlled by the Syrian Army .

The Israeli and Syrian Armies face each other in considerable strength across a line extending from about 20 miles east of Beirut to within a few miles of the Syrian border. // Colonel Ben-Zvi said today that the Syrians had stopped breaking the cease-fire in the Bekaa since Sunday , when Israeli officials in Jerusalem said they would not tolerate such violations , and emphasized that they retained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s land pullout started with a hitch , at about dawn , at the Galerie Samaan checkpoint leading out of the city . Israeli officers claimed that the Italian and Lebanese Army soldiers were not properly counting the P.L.A. troops as they boarded trucks , jeeps , vans and automobiles. // There was no armed confrontation , but the departure for the Damascus road was delayed for about a half hour while the Italians and Lebanese made a count that satisfied the Israelis . The final figure for those departing overland was given as 1 , 351. // An hour or so before the convoy reached Sofar , the Israeli Army was preparing to be invisible , except for a large national flag flying on a sidestreet . The Israelis wanted to disappear because under the agreement they were not supposed to humiliate the departing forces by standing on the road , or in the port , in their military uniforms , as victors watching the vanquished . <> <> Israelis in Civilian Clothes // So before the trucks came , an Israeli officer ordered three soldiers to clean up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkpoint , put some polish on their black boots , and get out of sight . The officers changed from their green uniforms into slacks and sports shirts . An Israeli television crew nested its equipment on top of a three-story house at the checkpoint. // Lebanese Army soldiers replaced the Israelis on the road and waved the trucks past as they came . The departing soldiers waved their automatic rifles , the red , green , white and black P.L.O. flag and made " V " signs with their fingers to watching townspeople. // One observer , a Moslem resident of west Beirut here in his summer house , noticed a group of those departing riding in a shiny , new white Peugeot . " They stole it , " the Lebanese said . " They stole everything they could touch.
