Suddenly stocks and bonds go roaring away . Short-term interest rates have fallen to 13. 5 percent. // And there you are , paddling around in your money market fund. // You don ' t have to ride in anyone ' s wake , however . Often , with a phone call , you can switch into a stock , bond , gold , or tax-exempt mutual fund . And more investors are doing so. // If most everyone who had a money market fund account did make such a phone call , the mutual fund groups would be swamped with cash for fresh investment . But this is considered unlikely . Relatively unknown until the mid-1970s , money market funds now have over $220 million in assets , or 80 percent of all mutual fund assets , according to Harry J. Guinivan of the Investment Company Institute , the mutual fund industry ' s trade association . In the summer of 1980 only 4 million money market accounts existed . Now there are over 13 million. // Many people with money market funds don ' t realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought into Fidelity ' s Cash Reserves , managed by one of the nation ' s largest mutual fund groups , you have 24 other funds to choose from . You could go with riskier high-growth stocks , more conservative high-income stocks , or tax-exempt municipal bonds. // If you have invested in a money market fund , it ' s likely you have access to other types of mutual funds . According to Mr. Guinivan , about 95 percent of the money market funds are part of a fund complex. // ' ' Mutual fund groups have had to create their own money market funds if they didn ' t have one , ' ' he observed . ' ' They couldn ' t afford to be left behind . ' ' Last December there were 159 money market funds . Now there are 245. // Some of the larger and more diversified fund families include : American Funds ; American General Capital ; Dreyfus ; Eaton &; Howard , Vance Sanders ; Federated Securities ; Fidelity ; Investors Diversified ( IDS ) ; Kemper ; Merrill Lynch ; Oppenheimer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanguard ; and Value Line. // Switching between funds is like finger painting : Once you get your hands dirty , it ' s relatively simple . Generally , you merely read the prospectus of the fund you are moving to , send a letter saying you have read the prospectus and are authorizing the exchange , and pay a $5 bookkeeping fee . If you are switching from a no-load ( commission-free ) fund into a load-fund - usually with a brokerage commission of 8. 5 percent - you will be charged a fee on the amount of money you move. // You will also have to pay capital-gains taxes . A provision shortening long-term capital gains from one year to six months was struck from the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 , passed in August . But it may make it through on the next round . That would allow you to transfer your money from one fund to another after only six months and pay the lower long-term capital gains tax of 20 percent. // Most fund managers will not encourage you to make switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bad move . More important , however , is the disruption a large amount of switching causes. // ' ' If money is flowing in and out of the fund , ' ' explains Erica Diesel at Vanguard , ' ' the portfolio manager can ' t make a big buy when he needs to . Switching hurts the performance of the entire portfolio. ' ' // Nonetheless , switching is hot . According to James Schabacker , publisher of Switch Fund Advisory , the average subscriber to his newsletter moves his investment between three and six times a year. // During the mid-August surge in the stock market , Victor Kramer of Fidelity noticed ' ' a striking acceleration ' ' of money being transferred from money market accounts to tax-exempt bond funds. // ' ' The quickest to move are the high-income , sophisticated investors . If interest rates keep falling and the stock and bond markets keep rising , corporate bond funds and stock funds will follow suit - but at a slower rate , ' ' he adds. // Richard Vesely of Delaware Management Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advertising campaign to increase its cash reserves ( money market funds ) . ' ' I ' m calling it , ' The sky is falling ' club , ' ' he remarked . ' ' We have had no indication that money market funds are dropping off . Most of these people are savers who want safety and income , not investors who want to take risks . They won ' t switch , and they shouldn ' t. ' ' // But according to Mr. Schabacker , now is the time to be in equity . On Aug. 21 , he advised his subscribers to move all of their money out of cash securities and into equity . Previous to that he recommended 75 percent equity and 25 percent cash. // Mr. Schabacker uses what he terms an analytical forecaster to determine general trends in the market . He looks at indicators such as the Standard and Poor 500 average , the prime rate , and the business activity rate . Within that average , he makes specific recommendations for individual funds . ' ' Say we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular time . If Value Line equity fund has good upward momentum , ' ' he says , ' ' we ' ll be a trend follower and switch another 25 percent away from cash reserves and into equity. ' ' // Mr. Schabacker cited the Bull &; Bear Group as an example . If an investor had started in the group ' s gold fund in May 1980 , then switched to its growth ( stock ) fund in January , and finally to its cash ( money market ) fund in September 1981 , he would have seen his investment appreciate 45 percent . That ' s 27 percent a year as compared with 10 percent for the Standard and Poor 500 average. // The elegance of Mr. Schabacker ' s system is its conservatism . It follows trends rather than predicts them. // This theory parallels that of another well-known switch advisory service , Dick Fabian ' s Telephone Switch Newsletter . He rides the market up , keeping money in a fund as long as the current price is above its average for the previous 39 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . By using this system and keeping alert , you shouldn ' t be caught holding the bag if the fund goes sour , he maintains. // A person usually invests in mutual funds for two reasons . First , he wants to spread his risk by diversifying into many different stocks but doesn ' t have $200 , 000 to throw around . Second , he is not a professional stockbroker and doesn ' t have time to become one . It ' s important to remember why you are in your present mutual fund before hopping to another , financial planners say. // //
