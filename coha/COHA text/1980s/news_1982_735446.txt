txt The empty stone houses . perched on a hillside near Jerusalem , look so desolate now that it is hard to imagine this was once a thriving Arab village , whose elders liked to boast that it was " the richest village in Palestine . " Rifka Hammoudeh Odeh was born here . She fled 34 years ago , along with the other This is the second of a series of articles on the Palestinians . Arab residents , after Jewish gunmen attacked a local coffee house . But she has n't forgotten the old paths of the village , and she guides her children quickly down the hill for a nostalgic visit to the abandoned stone house of their grandfather . Ali Odeh . Inside it is cool and quiet . Mrs. Odeh stands by the window , trying to reconstruct in her mind how it all looked once . She points to some of the decayed houses on the hillside and names the families that once lived in them : the Hammoudehs , the Nassers , the Abu Lails , the Abu Zayeds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , Mrs. Odeh begins to cry . She recites an old Palestinian proverb : " My country , even if it was bitter to me , I would still love it ; and my family , even if they thought badly about me , I would still love them . " And then it is time to go home , back to a house on the edge of a refugee camp near Ramallah in the West Bank . The Palestinians of Lifta , and their children and grandchildren , now are scattered among nearly 50 countries . These " Liftawis , " as they call themselves , number about 20,000 , and it would probably be impossible to track them all down . But in interviews over the past two months , it was possible to talk with members of each of the families whose ancestral homes Mrs. Odeh saw through the window of her former home . Their stories describe what happened to one Palestinian village after an ' event that Palestinians call " the catastrophe . " They illustrate the diversity of life in the Palestinian diaspora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborer living in a refugee camp . They show the way Palestinians , like earlier generations of Jews , have used education to gain a measure of security . And they demonstrate the abiding anger and hostility of the more than two million Palestinian refugees toward Israel . Coffee-House Attack What matters most is that many Liftawis , despite their exile , say they still think of this rocky hillside  --  though it is in Israel , surrounded now by residential suburbs of Jerusalem ? as their home . When they talk about the dream of a Palestinian state , they do n't simply mean a small enclave in the West Bank and Gaza . They mean a state that includes Lifta and the several hundred other Arab villages that were evacuated in 1948 when the state of Israel was created . " We teach our grandchildren that their homeland is Lifta , " says Ahmad al-Isis , the president of a group based in Jordan called the Arab Lifta Welfare Society . " We are n't going to forgive the Jews , " he warns . Our land is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to get it back . " The flight from Lifta began the night of Dec. 29 , 1947 , when the Jewish gunmen opened fire on the Arab coffee house near the old village of Lifta . Six men were killed , including one of the local tribal leaders , known as " Moukhtars . " The residents of Lifts were terrified and began to leave immediately . It was probably the first Arab village in Palestine to be evacuated . Most families went first to the Arab quarter of Jerusalem . or to Ramallah , an Arab town about eight miles north . Everyone assumed they would soon be going back to Lifta . But as months passed the fighting got worse , and people began to realize that they might become permanent refugees . Those with money found houses or apartments in Jerusalem or Ramallah . Others moved east to Amman , Jordan . Hassan Odeh was working as a conductor on the Palestine railroad in December 1947 , and he was away from Lifta when the trouble began . When he returned , he found that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared . His father , Ali , had moved the family to Ramallah . Now 90 and in poor health , All Odeh recalls the departure from Lifta in a trembling voice . " We left because we were scfited , " he says . " We were sure that when this little fight finished , we would go back . in five or eight days maybe . " All Odeh has been back to Lifta only once since then , for a brief , melancholy visit in 1967 . Hassan Odeh 's children have dispersed further . His eldest son has completed his bachelor 's and master 's degrees in engineering at the University of Michigan and is working as a field engineer in Detroit for Turner Construction Co . The next oldest son has just finished his bachelor 's degree in engineering . also at Michigan . Two other sons are still in school in Ramallah . Of the four Odeh daughters , one took a B.A. at the Arab University of Beirut , married a Palestinian doctor , and now lives in West Germany ; another has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying chemistry at a university in the West Bank ; the last is finishing a teacher-training course . Other branches of the Odeh family are even more scattered . There are cousins in Dubai , Jordan , Kuwait and London . One cousin is in an Israeli prison , serving a life sentence on terrorism charges . An uncle named Ahmad disappeared for years and returned in 1975 to tell tales of life in the U.S. and Argentina . An aunt named Zahia married Mike Mahmoud , who runs a prosperous insurance business in Belleville , Ill . Zahia is living the good life in America . Her husband , an affable salesman who likes to call people " Buddy , " owns a Lincoln , a Plymouth Champ recreational vehicle , a Pontiac Bonneville and a Cadillac convertible . But Zahia says she gets " very sad " when she thinks of the village where ' she was born and insists : " I 'm still from Lifta . " Families ' Stories The same basic pattern ? of flight , refugee life and a struggle to gain security through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families that lived near the Odehs in Lifta . Each family 's saga could fill a book , but a few details convey the nature of this diaspora . ? The Hammoudeh family moved to Amman , then most went ' on to Kuwait , where there now are 12 different Hammoudeh households that trace their ancestry to Lifta . Yehiya Hammoudeh , a 73-year-old lawyer , ii'tfi6 patriarch of the family . For a time in tOe late 1960s , he was a top official in the Palestine Liberation Organization . He now lives in Amman and holds court in an office Tted with dusty Arabic law books . " No Pale inian will ever give up the hope that all of qalestine will be regained , " he thunders , adding that the PLO 's goal should be " the destruction of the Zionist entity of Israel .

' This Belongs to Us ' ? Jamil Ahmad Nasser , now in his 80s , was the first boy from Lifta who went to study in Jerusalem . He lives now in a house in East Jerusalem , surrounded by Israeli high-rise apartment buildings . Of his nine children , six have university degrees and four have graduate degrees . His sons inchide a lawyer in London , a sociology professor in Amman , a physician in East Jerusalem , another doctor in Dublin and a businessman in Nigeria . ? Nabil Nasser , the doctor in East Jerusalem ? takes a visitor on an hour-long tour of the land that was once part of Lifta , repeati0g every few minutes , " This belongs to us. * . .

He lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scopus in East Jerusalem . But he says his family once ( *lied 400 acres in Lifta , and he has musty old Turkish documents  --  deeds going back 120 years and tax receipts going back 85 years  --  to prove it . Mr. Abu Lail 's sons are successful : One a government official in Amman , one is a doctor there , and three others are contractprs in Abu Dhabi . But the old man remains land-obsessed . " Just return half of my rand , " he pleads . " We could make a deal . " But then he reconsiders : " I ca n't deal with Ekegin . He destroyed my life . " blight to Arabia ? Mohammed Moussa Abu Zayed was a prosperous Lifta merchant , with an office in Haifa . In early 1948 , he fled from Haifa to Beirut ; four years later he moved on to Shudi Arabia , where he began working for a Saudi prince . Today , he is a Saudi citizen and a very wealthy man .

" He says it is " impossible " for people bbrn in Lifta , like himself , to renounce their claims to that land . ? Haj Youssef Abu Tea , also 75 , lives in the Amarl refugee camp near Ramallah . His family lived most of the last 30 years without indoor plumbing , and an open sewer still runs nearby . If Mr. Abu Taa is a stonecutter , and most of his sons followed him into manual work .

The Abu aas are a poor family , but even here there 14 a drive for success : One young son is studying medicine in Romania . Abbas Abu ea , the Washington waiter , says the flirting family still thinks of Lifta as home . , Exactly why all these people abandoned Vita , however remains a mystery . The question haunts the old men of Lifts enough that they have invented a legend to explain Itlw they left . The legend has it that they fled after the now-famouf Israeli attack on the village of Deir Yassin , a few miles southwest of Lifta , which killed 250 villagers and caused a. panic throughout Palestine . That is the story All Odeh tells his grandchildren , and the story Haj Ahmad Abu Lail tells his grandchildren . But according to Yehiya Hammoudeh and Ahmad al-Isis , it is false . They insist that Deir Yassin happened nearly four months after most families had left Lifta . This confusion about dates illustrates the difficulty many Palestinians have dealing with " the catastrophe " of 34 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s , they appear to have ignored the signs of trouble mounting around them  --  and then panicked at the last moment , when it was too late . Few Arabs in Lifta owned guns , and it seems they never imagined they might have to fight for their land . " Jews and Arabs had always been friends in our area , " says All Odeh , expressing the view of many Liftawis . This description seems accurate : As the suburbs of Jerusalem pushed West toward Lifta in the 1930s and 1940s , many Liftawis sold or rented land to Jewish families moving into the area . The attack on the coffee house in Lifta burst this bubble . Arab residents who before had hoped for the best now feared the worst . They fled , pell-mell , and the village was empty in a matter of days . Later , when they realized they had lost their homes , perhaps forever , they got angry . And the anger has only increased in the years since . Israeli View Israeli historians argue that the Arabs of Lifta have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of anti-Jewish attacks , and people ran away because they were afraid of revenge , " says Gabriel Cohen , a professor at Tel Aviv University who has written extensively on the 1948 Arab-Israeli war . Nakdimon Rogel , an Israeli broadcasting executive who fought in 1948 and is an expert on the Jerusalem battles , agrees that Lifta had been " a notorious lair of Arab gangs since 1920 . " He says that the Israeli attack on the coffee house followed an Arab raid on Jews in the area . The Liftawis ' anger at the Israelis , he suggests , may partly reflect " guilt " over fleeing their homes . * * * On a hill overlooking the old village of Lifta , just above the main highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , is the modern house that Ali Odeh built for his family in 1937 . It was his dream house , with three floors , indoor plumbing , and central heating . Three Israeli families live in the house now : the Shabtais , who came here from Iraq ; the Arizonis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morocco . None of them have ever heard of All Odeh . From the house , you can still see the cactus trees that Lifta families planted around their houses to keep away stray animals , and far below , the valley the villagers called " the Valley of the Ghosts . " In the distance , on the next hilltop , are the gleaming white apartment buildings of a new Israeli suburb .
