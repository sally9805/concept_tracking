Of manslaughter , not murder <P> <P> A murder 's infamy usually derives from the renown of the victim or the ghastliness of the crime . But when Richard Adan , 22 , a budding playwright and a waiter , was stabbed last summer by a restaurant patron , the fascination focused on the killer : Jack Henry Abbott , Marxist , existentialist , prison murderer , author ( In the Belly of the Beast ) and , beginning a few weeks before Adan 's killing , literary celebrity ( see ESSAY ) . On his 38th birthday last week in Manhattan , Abbott was found guilty of manslaughter . Because he admitted that he had killed Adan , the verdict was considered a victory for the defense . Said Defense Lawyer Ivan Fisher : " When they said not guilty on murder two , I was enormously relieved . I was flying . " His client , Fisher said , " was speechless , almost dazed . " <P> Still , Abbott will return to the belly of the beast for a long time to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manslaughter conviction will bring an additional 8-to 25-year sentence , and if he is deemed a " persistent violent felony offender " at a hearing this month , he could go back to jail for life . <P> The verdict of first-degree manslaughter is applicable when the killer is found to have been in the throes of " an extreme emotional disturbance . " On the night he was killed last July , Adan had explained to Abbott that his tiny , bohemian caf lacked a bathroom for customers . He then led the ex-con outside to show him where he could discreetly relieve himself . Yet Abbott 's 24 years in violence-steeped prisons and reform schools , Fisher argued , had caused him to mistake Adan 's ordinary gestures for provocation . It was a " tragic misunderstanding , " Abbott claimed in court , that made him lash out . The jury , which deliberated for two days , rejected a graver guilty verdict of second-degree murder , which assumes an unmitigated intent to kill . <P> Henry Howard , Adan 's father-in-law , was angered but found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to get the chair , " he said . " Put him on an island . Give him a typewriter . But do n't let this guy walk the streets again . " Abbott will be sentenced this month .
