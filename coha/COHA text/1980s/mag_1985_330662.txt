No wonder residents call it Starship Chicago , when they are not calling it ruder names . It seems not so much to have risen in the Loop as to have landed there . The outside of the futuristic new State of Illinois Center has three tiers of curving glass setbacks fanning out in a vertically striped polygon . A canopy of pink and white glass panels dresses the base ; a sliced-cylinder skylight emerges at the top . Inside , in a light-filled atrium , salmon pink terraces climb for 17 stories around a circular plaza . Glass elevators rise and fall along the outside of two towers . As little Dorothy once said , " Toto , I have a feeling we 're not in Kansas any more . " <P> Exactly , says the architect , Helmut Jahn : " Technically , spatially , functionally and symbolically , this is something new . " That was what Illinois Governor James R. Thompson wanted when he ordered the building in 1979 as a workplace for some 3,000 state employees . Thompson , who chose the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago office there , although the $172 million structure does not officially open until May . " It was a lot of money and a radical design , " says Thompson . " But I felt that sometimes only government can afford to take the chance to do something really different . " <P> In Chicago , where the skyscraper was born and raised , they try to greet new buildings with an open mind , if not always with open arms . But confronted with a civic structure that looks a bit like a celestial sports arena , Chicagoans have vacated the middle ground and formed vehemently opposing camps . John Zukowsky , curator of architecture at the Art Institute of Chicago , thinks " it has the potential to be the next ' image ' of Chicago . " Heaven forbid , says Architect Harry Weese . " Tinselly and decadent , " he growls . " The building will be an oddity , like the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood . " People are choosing up sides that way all over town  --  at parties , in editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to praise Jahn or to bury him . <P> For all its novelty , the Illinois Center is not new in all respects . It draws on ideas that have had currency among architects for more than a decade : the adventurous geometry of " late modernists " such as I.M. Pei and Edward Larrabee Barnes ; the office atrium pioneered by Kevin Roche ; the glass- , enclosed elevators popularized by John Portman 's Hyatt hotel designs ; and the spirited use of color epitomized by the Miami firm Arquitectonica . The German-born Jahn , 45 , an architect celebrated  --  some would say notorious  --  for his arch flourishes with high-tech elements , had applied some of the same ideas in his own earlier work , notably his 1982 First Source Center atrium in South Bend , Ind . Moreover , in such designs as his witty 1982 addition to the Chicago Board of Trade and his romantic Southwest Center , soon to rise in Houston , he has moved toward an ever more fanciful treatment of modernist themes .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
