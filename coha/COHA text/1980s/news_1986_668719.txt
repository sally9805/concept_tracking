Last paragraph appeared in Chicagoland . Seventeen states , including Illinois , banned the sale of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules Friday as the chairman of the Tylenol manufacturer offered a $100 , 000 reward in the search for whoever spiked two bottles of the painkiller with lethal doses of cyanide in New York ' s Westchester County . " What has happened in Westchester  --  and just over three years ago in Chicago  --  is an act of terrorism , pure and simple , " James Burke , chairman of Johnson &; Johnson , said at a press conference at the firm ' s corporate headquarters here . The company also offered a $100 , 000 reward in late 1982 when cyanide- laced Tylenol killed seven persons in the Chicago area . No one was ever charged in the deaths and the reward was never given . Johnson &; Johnson stopped production of Tylenol capsules earlier this week and Burke said the company has discussed discontinuing the product , which is the country ' s most popular nonprescription painkiller . " I think it ' s possible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that . " Meanwhile in Westchester County , the wealthy New York City north suburban area where the tainted Tylenol bottles were found , authorities discounted a $2 million extortion letter written to police in Bronxville , N.Y. A copy of the letter was discovered when Secret Service agents arrested three people in an unrelated credit-card fraud case . One of the three arrested , DeWitt Gilmore Jr. , 21 , admitted writing the extortion letter , prosecutors said , but was not charged in the Tylenol case . " It has no connection with the Elsroth investigation , " said Carl Vergari , Westchester County district attorney . Diane Elsroth of Peekskill , N.Y. , died Feb. 8 after taking two Extra- Strength Tylenol capsules that had been purchased at an A &; supermarket in Bronxville . A second bottle with cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules was discovered Thursday by scientists from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . The bottle came from a Woolworth ' s in Bronxville two blocks from the A &; Frank Young , FDA commissioner , said Friday that analysis of the cyanide from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potassium cyanide implicated in the death of Diane Elsroth . Therefore , both samples most probably have come from the same source . " Deepening the mystery , FDA officials said there appeared to be no evidence of tampering with either of the bottles , which had the triple tamper- resistant seals Johnson &; Johnson has used since the Illinois deaths . Company executives and FDA officials said the two suspect bottles were manufactured in separate plants , the first in Pennsylvania and the second in Puerto Rico . They said this appeared to rule out tampering at the factory level . Joseph Chiesa , president of McNeil Consumer Products Co. , the Johnson &; Johnson subsidiary that produces Tylenol , said that after manufacture both bottles were sent to the firm ' s distribution center in Montgomeryville , Pa . But he said the bottles were at the warehouse at different times . From the company warehouse , the bottles were shipped to retail warehouses of A &; supermarkets and Woolworth stores . Chiesa said the chances that two bottles would be contaminated at the distribution center , sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other in Bronxville were minute . However , Vergari said that contamination at the plant was the most likely explanation of the poisonings . He asserted that despite the different lot numbers on the two bottles , both could have been manufactured in Pennsylvania . Burke called this contention " totally untrue . " Chiesa agreed , saying the lot numbers are placed on the bottles as they go through the production line of individual plants . Vergari , who is conducting the homicide investigation into Elsroth ' s death , said investigators have three working theories : " Introduction at the plant , which in my judgment seems most likely right now , " he said . " Second , it was taken from a shelf someplace and put back on the shelf . Or in the case of the Elsroth bottle , it was introduced sometime after it was bought . That seems the least likely scenario . " Each of these theories has serious drawbacks , however , and the lack of a plausible explanation for the poisonings has investigators and company executives shaking their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the FBI or the FDA , " Burke said . " We don ' t know how to improve the tamper-resistant package and for reasons we don ' t understand , it still was tampered with . . . . I thought we did a superb job . I guess we didn ' t . " So far , company officials said , more than 200 , 000 capsules have been tested for the presence of cyanide . The FDA has now expanded its testing in the Westchester area to include capsules from New Jersey , Connecticut and New York City , according to an official in the Brooklyn district office , where the testing is being conducted . Johnson &; Johnson was the most actively traded stocked on the New York Stock Exchange Friday , dropping $3. 75 a share to close at $48 . In the wake of the cyanide scare , bans on the sale of Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules have been put in effect in 17 states  --  Illinois , Arizona , Wisconsin , California , Florida , Idaho , Missouri , Massachusetts , Montana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Indiana , Vermont , Connecticut , Texas  --  and in the District of Columbia . Also , 15 other states have advised consumers to follow FDA warnings not to use Tylenol capsules . As part of the investigation , law enforcement authorities have discussed trying to contact LeAnn Lewis , wife of James Lewis , who is serving a 10-year prison term for attempted extortion in connection to the Illinois cyanide deaths . Vergari said LeAnn Lewis has not yet been interviewed by the FBI or other police authorities . The law enforcement team investigating the cyanide mystery is expected to be joined Saturday by two key members of the Illinois task force that looked into the Chicago-area deaths in 1982 . They are FBI agent Peter O ' Neil and Cmdr. Thomas Schumpp of the Illinois Division of Criminal Investigation , who directly supervised the Chicago-area investigation . O ' Neil was the FBI Chicago bureau ' s Tylenol-cyanide case agent . While no one was ever charged in the Illinois deaths , James Zagel , director of the Illinois State Police , said the investigation " produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the names of disgruntled employees of Johnson &; Johnson to identities of individuals with some access to the kind of poisons used in the killings .
