txt  | terseness of The Confidence Man ? show a restless waywardness of form , an exasperated need to try anything at hand , that finally came to rest in poetry privately published , poetry in which and for which he did not have to answer to anyone . This was to be true of the posthumous Billy Budd , which Melville left unfinished , perhaps not wanting to see it finished and published . When it was discovered in 1919 by Raymond Weaver , who was tracking down Melville for the first biography , Mariner and Mystic , it was in a confusing state in Melville 's most crabbed hand . Concealed in a tin breadbox , says Melville 's great-grandson Paul Metcalf , it had to be " dug loose from the tight seaweed of Melville 's heirs and descendants . " " Crabbed " is the word for Melville 's poetry ? and for the peculiar syntactical complexity of style in Billy Budd , which for all its drama betrays an instrument long unused as well as the grave slowness and quizzicality into which Melville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poetry is in every sense occasional . Even his most unforced , his easiest poem , " Billy in the Darbies , " which concludes Billy Budd and in its humorous stoicism at the approach of death sums up Melville 's work ( and life ) with all his old grace , answers to a kind of occasion : April 19 , 1891 , the date Melville added to " End of Book . " " Billy in the Darbies " is a truly personal poem , " dramatic " in its monologue , since it is Billy speaking from his last night on earth . So many of Melville 's poems ? about history , vaguely historic personages , " fruits of travel long ago , " Melville 's burrowing in historical myths ? proceed from some grave meditative center .

Reading Melville 's verse , one can not help picturing him , evening after evening , wreathed in cigar smoke as he measures his way from line to line , rhyme to rhyme . In one of his Battle-Pieces , " Commemorative of a Naval Victory , " he was surely thinking of himself when he wrote : But seldom the laurel wreath is seen Unmixed with pensive pansies dark ; There 's a light and a shadow on every man  | Nursing through night the ethereal spark . Elate he never can be ; He feels that spirit which glad had hailed his worth , Sleep in oblivion. ? The shark Glides white through the phosphorous sea . " The shark / Glides white through the phosphorous sea " certainly breaks up the evening labor wreathed in cigar smoke ; Melville is full of wonderful lines . There are no outcries from this long-haunted man like the middle passages of baffled love in " After the Pleasure Party . " " Amor threatening , " he calls it in this remarkable piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cost of her virginal existence . This is an unusually felt monologue . With the sudden brilliance that can flash across a Melville poem , his preoccupation with sexual ambiguity now asserts itself in urgent tones . Could I remake me ! or set free This sexless bound in sex , then plunge Deeper than Sappho , in a lunge Piercing Pan 's paramount mystery ! For , Nature , in no shallow surge Against thee either sex may urge , Why hast thou made us but in halves ? Co-relatives ? This makes us slaves . If these co-relatives never meet Self-hood itself seems incomplete . And such the dicing of blind fate Few matching halves here meet and mate . What Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder The human integral clove asunder And shied the fractions through life 's gate ? The weary , inexperienced poet was his old self , if not his once-Promethean self : he still took on big " historical " themes . But they were now occasions for reflection , not scenes of action . The requisite subject after 1865 was the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of national tragedy rather than patriotism . In " America " Valor with Valor strove , and died : Fierce was Despair , and cruel was Pride ; And the lorn Mother speechless stood ,  | The end of slavery stirred him less than the deaths of " young collegians . " But even Melville 's serial portraits of America 's slaughtered youth , like many poems in Battle-Pieces commemorating battles and leaders of the Civil War , seem composed in a gray light . They lack the involvement ( real or hoped ) that Whitman brought to Drum-Taps . Melville 's noble compassion for both sides shows no strong political resolve in response to America 's finest hour and everlasting hurt . The great exception is " The House-top , " Melville 's bitter response to the July 1863 anti-draft riots ; it jolts the reader after so many shadowy genre paintings of war . Melville as Coriolanus , standing on the roof of his house in New York , describes with the most concentrated contempt for the mob its " Atheist roar of riot . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his early works Melville 's most obvious political reflex was a jeer at conventional Western values ; missionary repressiveness and pettiness in the South Seas appalled him , as the natives certainly did not . He is disgusted by the city 's " new democracy , " its masses , and scornful of ... the Republic 's faith implied , Which holds that Man is naturally good , And ? more ? is Nature 's Roman , never to be scourged . He says with gritted teeth that The Town is taken by its rats ? ship-rats And rats of the wharves . All civil charms And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe ? Fear-bound , subjected to a better sway Than sway of self ; these like a dream dissolve , And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature . In " The Conflict of Convictions , " a poem about the anxious " secession winter " of 186o-61 , Melville obviously remembers his futile efforts , in sight of the unfinished Capitol dome , to obtain a consular appointment from the Lincoln administration . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleakness .

Age after age shall be As age after age has been , ( From man 's changeless heart their way they win ) ; And death be busy with all who strive Death , with silent negative . Why did Melville turn to poetry ? It was not just because his novels had failed ; or , as soft-minded critics once thought , because Melville 's " subjective " and " intellectual " side had become " excessive . " He had been willing to try any form , sometimes within a single " novel , " because his greatest literary need was to express contraries . As Hawthorne noticed , Melville never tired of " wandering to and fro " over " intellectual deserts . " The condensation of thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer frantic thinker . He was aging , he was " retired , " in just that drop of American idealism after the Civil War that saw ? nowhere more sharply than in Herman Melville ? a reversal of the Enlightenment . Verse offered the increasingly conservative ex-novelist the possibility that life could be contained as epigram . He anticipated at the end of " The Conflict of Convictions " ( and in capital letters ) the kind of jeering little " lines " that Stephen Crane called poetry : YEA AND NAYEACH HATH HIS SAY ; BUT GOD HE KEEPS THE MIDDLE WAY . NONE WAS BY WHEN HE SPREAD THE SKY ; WISDOM IS VAIN , AND PROPHESY . Melville offered a riposte to Blake in a poem from Timoleon , " Fragments of a Lost Gnostic Poem of the 12th Century . " Indolence is heaven 's ally here , And energy the child of hell : The Good Man pouring from his pitcher clear , But brims the poisoned well .

" As an exuberant young author just in from the Pacific , Melville had sought to transcend limits , to escape confines , to find in the heroic age of his young country the last undiscovered place . As a fugitive from the great American marketplace , Melville then " reduced " himself to stories for magazines , to soliloquies in his travel notes on Egypt and Palestine , to the contemptuous " masquerade " of The Confidence Man , to octosyllabics in his long narrative poem Clarel . In his last three years he was to reduce himself to the anonymity of Billy Budd and its theme , the father 's compliance in the death of the son . In the wild flight of writing Moby-Dick , Melville had praised himself ( while praising Hawthorne ) for embodying " a certain tragic phase of humanity . . . . We mean the tragedies of human thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the apprehension of the absolute condition of present things as they strike the eye of the man who fears them not , though they do their worst to him . " Melville the great American agonist , forever trying to recapture his belief in the God-given unity of all things , was a thinker unmistakably in search of the elemental . In his first , romantic books , this quest made him go to the ends of the earth . In the triumphant moment of his life , when he was finishing Moby-Dick , he avowed to Hawthorne that his own deepest concern was with the beginning and end of things . As a sailor he had had the merest glimpse of the Galapagos , but in the marvellous sketches and tales of " The Encantadas " Melville recreated a biblical scene ? the first days of creation . In his journal of Egypt and Palestine , the intensity of his lifelong association with the Bible led him to put his impressions into the starkest personal shorthand .

Must bring your own provisions , as well , too , for mind as body ? for all is barren . Melville had to make his way to the Holy Land after his nervous crisis of the 185os , just as when a young man , " having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world . " Melville 's instinct made him sink the Pequod in the deepest waters of the Pacific . With like instinct he sought nature in its most savage aloofness from man . Yet even in the Holy Land , " the issues there but mind , " as he wrote at the end of Clarel , he betrayed his truly " metaphysical anguish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was in East Twenty-sixth Street , where this wanderer in thought was hidden by the frantic busyness of New York . Melville retreating to New York regarded himself as a private thinker , nearly anonymous . The anonymity was parallel to the theme at the heart of all his work . Was there a home for thought , unavailing , unending thought , in this world of indifference ? Ahab 's assault on the white whale was not more dogged than Melville 's on the looming nothingness that invades his style with endless play on words ending in " less " ? homeless , landless , formless , speechless ? on images of extreme personal will ? furious  --   --  on different names for blockage ? verge , wall , pyramid . The beast always in view is emptiness , the deception inherent in the mere appearance of things . The harpooner rising to " strike " gets caught from " behind , " is snagged and twisted in the rope whose coiled force catapults him into the sea . Dream and electric bitterness , strength and abjection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No other " isolato " ( he made up the word ) in American writing communicates so fervently a writer 's looking for a place to put his mind . Emptiness ! In the New York of the Gilded Age and the Brown Decades , the landlocked sailor was more than ever alone with himself . It was his nature to rebound on himself as the desperate quest . But his strangest association with New York was that living there did not matter. * " Melville had taken the measure of " society " in The Confidence Man ( 1857 ) , unmistakably the work of an extraordinary mind obsessed with the falsity of appearances . As a satire on a trickster 's society , it repeats itself claustrophobically ? Melville 's depression is all over the book like fog . This ship of fools never takes off ; is not intended to . Melville rings so many changes on his single idea that for all the intellectual ferocity of the took , the shifting appearances of the trickster in his " masquerade " make heavy going . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is entirely static  --  not  | Still , Melville did have his roots , and more besides , in this " Babylonish brick-kiln . " New York from the 186os to Melville 's death in 1891 was the money city that the expatriate Edith Wharton would return to in her last , unfinished novel , The Buccaneers . It would soon be the city that another New Yorker , Henry James , would confront in 1904 as the most " extravagant " of international cities . To think of Melville back in New York is to remember Edith Wharton 's complaint that " he was qualified by birth to figure in the best society , " for he was a cousin of the Van Rensselaers . Alas , she " never heard his name mentioned . " We can imagine what the rich and bossy Edith Wharton ( Henry James complained that she regularly " swooped " down on him even when he welcomed the discovery of the world from her " motor " ) would have made of a descendant of the best society working as a customs inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophetic Britishers and Canadians wrote Melville of their admiration for him and their inability to procure all his books . They wanted to see him . Robert Buchanan in New York complained that " no one seemed to know anything of the one great imaginative writer fit to stand shoulder to shoulder with Whitman on that continent . " All that the reigning literary mediocrity of the day , the stockbroker-poet Edmund Clarence Stedman , could tell him was that " Melville is dwelling somewhere in New York . " Melville had no assurance of tenure in his " political " job . He was so much in danger of losing it that his brother-in-law John Hoadley wrote to the secretary of the treasury to ask you , if you can , to do or say anything in the proper quarter to secure him permanently , or at present , the undisturbed enjoyment of his modest , hard-earned salary , as deputy inspector of the Customs in the City of New York , Herman Melville . Proud , shy , sensitively honorable ? he had much to overcome , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform his duties as to make the slightest censure , reprimand , or even reminder , ? impossible from any superior . Surrounded by low venality , he puts it all quietly aside , quietly returning money which has been thrust into his pockets behind his back , avoiding offence alike to the corrupting merchants and their clerks and runners , who think that all men can be bought , and to the corrupt swarms who shamelessly seek their price ; quietly , steadfastly doing his duty , and happy in retaining his own self-respect . This glimpse of Melville during the Iron Age ( when New York became the great exchange place for money and money-making ) can fascinate a New  | old New York ? the lower city . In the eighties , when he had retired from his nineteen years on the docks , he sometimes dropped in on John Anderson 's bookstore in Nassau Street ? and he is rumored to have bought copies of his books in the financial district , where Bartleby did his scrivening . His genially uncomprehending employer was a Wall Street lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-window in that part of the room , a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy backyards and bricks , but which , owing to subsequent erections , commanded at present no view at all , though it gave some light . Within three feet of the panes was a wall , and the light came down from far above , between two lofty buildings , as from a very small opening in a dome . Still further to a satisfactory arrangement , I procured a high green folding screen , which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight . Melville himself flashes into animation when he can report " a ship on my district from Girgate ? Where 's that ? Why , in Sicily ? the ancient Agrigentum . . . . I have not succeeded in seeing the captain yet ? have only seen the mate ? but hear that he has in possession some stones from these magnificent Grecian ruins , and I am going to try to get a fragment , however small , if possible . " The altogether proper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bust of Antinoiis on a stand in the hall , the little white sails in the Bay of Naples on the wall , the oversized desk in his bedroom . On Sundays he walked with his grandchildren in the park . " At my years , and with my disposition , " he wrote to John Hoadley , " one gets to care less and less for everything except downright good feeling . " Home he is and taken his wages . Surely his feelings were those he had confessed to Hawthorne in the exultation of finishing Moby-Dick ? " Am I now not at peace ? Is not my supper good ? " But if Melville was " peaceful " ( the Melville family motto was Heaven at Last , and Melville may still have had longings in that direction ) , the resurrected Melville , the Melville who surfaced posthumously with Billy Budd ( and much more besides ) , seemed anything but peaceful , was still endlessly dramatic .

" There is in  | will to survive by writing ? and who is acid yet clamorous in a style that reminds us more of Rimbaud and Beckett than of the stoic acceptances of Hardy and Conrad . Melville 's protagonist and hero is thematically the deserter , the shipwrecked sailor , the castaway , the tramp , the mad author , the criminal ? and most centrally , the iconoclast who does not escape retribution from society by becoming a murderer . On September 13 , 1971 , more than a thousand New York State troopers stormed the Attica State Correctional Facility , where 1,200 inmates held thirty-eight guards hostage , thereby ending a four-day rebellion in the maximum-security prison . Many of the troopers shouted " White Power ! " as they broke into the prison yard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead was Sam Melville , known as the Mad Bomber , a leader of radical groups in the 196os who had adopted his last name because of his total veneration of a writer he identified with revolution . Carl Oglesby , another radical leader in the sixties , said in an article on " Literature as Revolution " : Our abiding contemporary Melville posed in effect the following question : " Given these historical origins and social sources , these current grounds of spirit and pathways of hope , how might we secure the faith that our imperialminded republic , unlike its ancient homologues , will not commit its energies in immense genocidal gulps at the expense , one time or another , of all the major colors , types and varieties of mankind ? " Melville , eclipsing his idol Hawthorne , became a hero to all who found a mirror image in Melville 's expansiveness and " ambiguities . " " Call Me Ishmael , " said the poet Charles Olson in an excited little book most important for documenting Melville 's debt to Shakespeare . " Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated by the beauty and pathos of Melville 's last work . In the 1920S Melville fascinated Hart Crane , Lewis Mumford , Jean Giono ; was soon to fascinate W. H. Auden , Cesare Pavese , E. M. Forster , Benjamin Britten . He became such an obsession for highbrow opinion that the best-selling novelist John Marquand jealously attacked him . In the postwar reaction against the Popular Front liberalism of the 193os , Melville even became a totem to neoconservatives in academe . In death as in life , Melville was like no other American " classic " ; he divided bitter political loyalties .  | Which of his many books speaks for him now ? Which had the last word ? From Billy Budd , certainly his last work , the secret work of his old age , it is easy to assume that Melville had found a solution to his long search for truth past the chimera of this world . The solution is law , or authority . In the great debate over Billy Budd 's fate , between Captain Vere and the young officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing of Claggart , Vere drives them to hang someone who is possibly his own son . " How can we adjudge to summary and shameful death a fellow creature innocent before God , and whom we feel to be so ? ? Does that state it aright ? You sign sad assent . Well , I too feel that , the full force of that . It is Nature . But do these buttons that we wear attest that our allegiance is to Nature ? No , to the King . Though the ocean , which is inviolate Nature primeval , though this be the element where we move and have our being as sailors , yet as the King 's officers lies our duty in a sphere correspondingly natural ? So little is that true , that in receiving our commissions we in the most important regards ceased to be natural free agents . . . . Our vowed responsibility is in this : That however pitilessly that law may operate in any instances , we nevertheless adhere to it and administer it . " Perhaps it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end ; it may have been " authority . " This may have been his way out of the total anarchy of appearances in The Confidence Man , that nihilistic babel of voices from an unmoving ship on an unbelievable river . No one is going anywhere in that book . But in the ever-growing contempt for American professions of honesty , The Confidence Man became what one anxious scholar called " Melville as Scripture . " So the drama of his many changes went on , as it had for so long gone on within Melville himself , each book seeming to cancel the one before . It was Melville 's capacious intellectual personality that drew so many people to the different images he now presents . But the tormented subjectivism behind all his work shows the same problem ? to find truth that would not disappear from voyage to voyage , book to book . Where is the foundling 's father hidden ? Where do murderers go , man ! Who 's to doom , when the judge himself is dragged to the bar ? By vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to the central room ; with joy we espy the sarcophagus ; but we lift the lid ? and no ixxiy is there ! ? appallingly vacant as vast is the soul of man .  | Melville 's " tales of terror told in words of mirth " were wonderful enough . But his assault on the " axis of reality , " driven by the most consummate doubt of where reality finally lay , pointed to lustful contradictions that only the future would relish . And that the future would not untangle or replace .  | Wrecked , Solitary , Here : Dickinson 's Room of Her Own Attentiveness without an aim is the supreme form of prayer . SIMONE WEIL , Notebooks " I think I could write a poem to be called Concord , " Thoreau wrote in his journal for 1841 .

But the style is too deliberate and always exclusive of what does not suit Thoreau 's fable of man totally at home with nature and himself . Hell , as Jean-Paul Sartre was to say in No Exit , is " other people . " Thoreau called them " visitors . " They interrupted his perfect solitude . Thoreau did think that people were always too much . Like his epigrams , they were separate pronouncements , not necessary to his world . He stood at a sharp angle to every foreign object in his specimen book of nature . Man in nature must lead to Perfection , which is the aim of existence . This is understood only as man feels himself under the eye of God . Nature is another name for God 's purpose . To this , other human beings can be an obstruction .

As I walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels , so I walked in the village to see the men and boys ; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle . In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows ; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men , as curious to me as if they had been prairie-dogs , each sitting at the mouth of its burrow , or running over to a neighbor 's to gossip .

The Civil War is not named , although in 1862 ? 63 it led to her writing more than a poem a day ? and some of her fiercest poems . But everything is there , including the people she loved and the family she saw most . She lives in the village , and it is her village .

We get the daily round as we do not get it from the symbolic use of the seasons in Walden or from Whitman 's catalogues of Americans at work . The daily round was also the daily urgency to write poems ( and hundreds of letters that are as antic in mood and swift in thought as her poems ) . They include some open hysteria , a ready sense of farce , deathbeds , sexual entreaty , playing the little girl or " Majesty , " mockery of male pomp , " what soft cherubic creatures these gentlewomen are , " the Connecticut Valley weather at play , plants and animals that positively imitate Victorian society .

She was well acquainted with idleness , reverie , blankness , despair . I 'm Nobody ! Who are you ? Are you ? Nobody ? Too ? Least of all did she believe that the human soul was needed to complete the universe . Saturated in a theological tradition that still provided the language for everyday experience , she made this tradition her daily resource . Religion was the background of her life , but her quest for a living God was often humorous . She must have recognized herself ( in addition to her other troubles ) as a reluctant sceptic ahead of her time . She was the first modern writer to come out of New England . Even in secluded little Amherst , the harsh Puritan vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been replaced by exemplary behavior . No one was allowed to forget that New England was still the American evangel ? of reform movements . Yet Dickinson somehow managed to live the dialectic of the old religion ? the minutely observing self under God 's all-seeing eye . Every instant of life was morally of supreme importance . This made her incessantly expressive , a Puritan trait . But she never affirmed faith where there was only a longing for faith . Her view of life remained strenuous , problematic , a contest . Writing was a trial of strength . God , whatever else He was not , was still the greatest weight on her life . Death was the next stage of life but was such a break with everything known that it could just as easily be called Immortality as not . Thus she lived a more complex consciousness than most American writers knew anything of . The " eternities " for Dickinson , as for Melville , are not to be doubted .

The pressure of mind against circumambient " reality " left so persistent and even tumultuous a record of battle that Dickinson is above all unsettling .

They were practicing " economy . " Dickinson respected Emerson but must have laughed at so much conscious rhetoric . She wrote out of turbulence , feeling now like " nobody , " now like a " queen " ; she wrote as a person bargaining for her life , line after line , not as an " infinite " soul . She often rushes at a poem , takes an immediate gulp of the situation in the first line ? " There came a Day at Summer 's full " ; " Hope ' is the thing with feathers .

A spotted shaft is seen And then it closes at your feet And opens further on full of foreboding : There 's a certain Slant of light , Winter Afternoons That oppresses , like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes Heavenly Hurt , it gives us ? We can find no scar ,  | But internal difference , Where the Meanings , are She can press her special names into a poem without indicating their connection ; she certainly wrote more for herself than she did for strangers . But her many remarkable effects come from her suddenly veering off to look at what she has presented . Drawing to the seen object , she wraps herself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terseness and breathless brevity derive from her persistence in seeing the world now on one surface , now on another ; folding and refolding the object in her hands . Poetry is not always " the past that breaks out in our hearts " ( Rilke ) . In Dickinson the present is entirely present . It makes a phenomenology of pure being . Almost every woman described to you by a woman presents a tragic idea , and not an idea of well-being . EMERSON , Journal , 1838 No one has ever drawn Emily Dickinson 's real character except herself . We must accept her saying that the " I " in her poems is not herself but her " representative . " But the " Years and Hours " recorded in her work present us with an overwhelming record of one person 's most minute reactions to existence . Whatever the woman 's actual relationship to the poet ? obviously this poet is this woman thinking ? we can not help reading the tumultuous cycle as one of the fullest records ever left of a life , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry seems to come directly out of her saying " I " : " I am afraid to own a Body ? " ; " I am alive ? I guess ? " ; " I can wade Grief ? " ; " I cautious , scanned my little life ? " ; " I dwell in Possibility ? . " Almost one hundred fifty poems begin as intensely personal reaction to the seasons , to meticulous changes in the weather and the light , to the slightest leap and ebb in her morale , to the arrivals and departures of people , to death in a neighbor 's house . There are poems of pure observation , poems so dominated by her zeal for capitalized abstractions that the freshest images turn into more " ideas , " poems that read as if she had just run up to her corner room to write down something she could laugh at . She often wrote to exorcise black depression . Her life was not so regular as it looked , since two moments of thought were never the same for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was so conscious of what was missing , of what need not be said , that a sense of absence serves not only to condense her poems but as her best punctuation . " I would eat evanescence slowly , " she wrote in a letter . Nothing became so real as instances of change . These finally coalesced into the departures of people , life passing , the possible unreality of her favorite counters ? Heart , Sky , Eternity , God . She moved them as if they were chess pieces . The sense of change formed her style , dictated its terseness . The spread of " moods , " reactions , fantasies , impersonations , is very wide . The cycle contains so much elation , transfiguration through nature , desolation ; her emotions represent so many marriages , death scenes , crises in the life of her family , friends , neighbors , that we become entangled in her life . This recluse involves us more than most poets do . No one can read these poems over and again without experiencing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read her three volumes of letters is to learn how often she sent a poem with a letter ; a letter in its abrupt use of images as absolutes served her as another " offering . " Single lines and phrases show the same urgent sense of contraction ? " A letter always feels to me like Immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend . " The letters are astonishing ; she starts in the middle of the most private thought , sends a friend her most arcane images , with the same confidence that she brings to the gnomic self-sufficiency of a poem . She trusted her mind even when she had little confidence in her life . The act of writing was the excitement of entering a body of thought , of keeping in sight the " circumference " of her farthest idea . Writing was a " leap , " following a trajectory different in kind from the self-consuming that threatened her . I can wade Grief Whole Pools of it I 'm used to that But the least push of Joy Breaks up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first by her immediacy , the hurtling directness of her attack . One is even more startled by her ability to present separate words as physical sensations . I lcr lexicon replenished itself from dictionaries , farmers ' almanacs , maps , and especially Shakespeare , her favorite . I is had such a large vocabulary . She had a whole cupboard of place names , nature names ,  | chemical names . Yellow Sea , cochineal , mazarin , Caspian Choirs , Broadcloth Hearts , Saxon finally belong to her alone , sit up in " Majesty , " as she liked to say . There is a rushing eagerness about her appropriations that makes us remember Conrad Aiken 's reference to " The Kid . " She was skilled at posing , as brother Austin laughingly reminded people when her banter was taken seriously . She could play the " coquette , " as her " dear preceptor , " Thomas Wentworth Higginson , noticed to his alarm when that virtuous man called on her . Higginson , an advanced liberal for his time and place , a courageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her personality. * Her " nervous force " exhausted him . One of his more objective biographers , Tilden Edelstein , notes that he was accustomed to confront aspiring woman writers directly and to bring such relationships down to the level of simple truth and everyday comradeship ? as he had done with Harriet Prescott Spofford , Rose Terry and Helen Jackson . . . . He found Dickinson 's views about poetic sensibility and the state of mankind " the very wantonness of over-statement . " " I never was with anyone who drained my nerve power so much . " Higginson did not see that provocativeness had become necessary to her surprised contact with anyone . The range of impersonation in her poetry is so wide that it is easy to believe that she once made " a spectacle of herself , " footnote Higginson , colonel of the First South Carolina Volunteers , the first black regiment in the Union army , was of course an ex-minister , an abolitionist , an early supporter of women 's rights . He was the only one of Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferry . He even procured a lawyer for Brown ; after Brown was hanged , Higginson attempted to save his followers . Higginson , representative conscience of his time and place , was for all his good deeds in war and peace as conventional a mind as the moral courage of New England put on the American stage . He was a popular lecturer in the Mark Twain era on " The Natural Aristocracy of the Dollar . " Higginson had the curiosity to seek Dickinson out ( after she had responded to his " Letter to a Young Contributor " in the Atlantic Monthly ) . But his incomprehension of Dickinson 's originality is clear in the rewriting perpetrated in the first edition of Dickinson 's poems ( 1890 ) , edited with Mabel Loomis Todd . It is amusing to read Higginson 's smug little tract , Common Sense About Women ( 1881 ) , which Higginson probably considered the bravest word on the subject : .. If woman has traits of her own , absolutely distinct from his , then man can not represent her , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To this last body of believers I belong . I think that all legal or conventional obstacles should be removed , which debar woman from determining for herself , as freely as man determines , what the real limitations of sex are , and what the merely conventional restriction . " ... It is l/rttcr not to baac any plea for woman on the ground of her angelic superiority . The argument pnwcs too much . If she is already so perfect , there is every inducement to let well enough  | as they long remembered in Amherst , then closed herself up again after hearing from the sisterhood . Dickinson 's poetry must be taken , initially , as a young woman 's rebellion . There are obvious cries of frustration , a sexual kittenishness and bravado , from the round corner room ( her first image of " circumference " ) in the house on Main Street . She was very late in accepting restrictions on her destiny ; it was a game to make restrictions on herself when her brother , Austin , and Susan Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , " sedate , churchly , assured . The Dickinsons were important people . The life of an unmarried young woman in the family setting was traditional . Whatever her often self-mocking cries of protest , she accepted the setting and the life that came with it . Amherst was a habit , like being a woman . But the narrowness of her outer experience shows in the repetition of her themes , her images of struggle , " her " seasons and birds . The deeper she sank into an altogether private destiny ? to violate the " circumference " of a surrounding mind that had no room for hers ? the more she depended on other people . Some she made up . Of course there were great loves in her life and behind her poetry ; there were almost too many . She loved by turning the arbitrary choice into the necessary predicament . Some of her letters and poems emit wild shrieks : connection must be kept up with someone . Her " Master , " as she addressed one still unknown to us , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more than one man ? ministers like Charles Wadsworth , editors like Samuel Bowles . Men of professional distinction were as much shadows of divinity as her favorite ideas . That was another Amherst tradition , like the Dickinsons themselves . But since she never harped even on this , her wit turned to banter ? of her longing for some intercession . She played the ingenue , the gamine , what Amherst called the " coquette . " She is so light and springy in the cycle of her moods ? so much the tease , acrobat , and willing clown of her many emotions ? that even apart from the fact that she resembles no other writer , she is especially unlike the earnest souls who dominated writing by women soon after the Civil War . Her own intense admirations were for Emily Bronte , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , George Eliot . I ielen I lunt Jackson , the author of Ramona and Mercy Pbil-  | friend. * It would be interesting to know what Dickinson made of such evangelical fiction of the early industrial scene as Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which we know she read in the Atlantic Monthly for April 1861 . But how much did she attribute her reluctance to publish to her being a woman ? How much did she feel hampered , restricted , and even denied as a writer in her time because she was not a man ? Being a " woman writer " likened rebels otherwise as different as the prodigious George Sand and the perkily brilliant but self-symbolizing Margaret Fuller . They dramatized their rebellion in society ; Hawthorne 's enduring dislike of Fuller and Emerson 's embarrassed efforts to accept her aggressive declarations of " friendship " show that provincial little Concord was rocked by Fuller 's independence and incessant expressiveness . Hawthorne , treated as the lord of creation by his Sophia , expressed himself violently about the " damned lot of scribbling women . . . . I wish they were forbidden to write on pain of having their faces deeply scarified with an oyster shell . " What bothered him was the " lot , " the club , the tribe of indistinguishably genteel and sentimental magazine writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity of fiction in the new " age of the magazine , " when the dominating audience was one of women , t helped to launch so many women writers that Henry James , supposedly writing an appreciation of the novels of his friend Constance Fenimore Woolson ( Harper 's Weekly , 1887 ) , confessed that " in America , at least , one feels tempted at moments to explain that they are in themselves the world of literature . " His " feeling " about women writers was certainly complicated . The work of Miss Woolson is an excellent example of the way the door stands open between the personal life of American women and the immeasurable world of print , and what makes it so is the particular quality that this work happens to possess . It breathes a spirit singularly and essentially conservative ? the sort of spirit which , but for a special indication pointing the other way , would in advance seem most to oppose itself to the introduction into the lot of new and complicating elements . footnote *If not a comprehending one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hunter had showed him several of Mercy 's poems , which had surprised him much by their beauty , and still more by their condensation of thought .

I le could not associate this slight , fair girl , with a child 's honesty and appeal in her eyes , with the forceful words he had read from her pen .

" tThe ( majority ) female reading audience was described by a contemporary as " the Iron Madonna  | James was relieved that poor Constance Woolson ( who among her other troubles was in love with him ) was not one for new and complicating elements . Even if James had been open to poetry ( he was not ) and the posthumous Dickinson had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was not in the " real " world , society . For James literature was a demonstration of society , while the heroic pathos of an Isabel Archer and the spunkiness of a Maggie Verver represented virtues missing in a society dominated by men . It was easy for him to feel the greatest sympathy for women ; their quiet resistance and even martyrdom exposed the nature of the society , European as well as American , that fascinated him . But could rigid little Amherst be thought of as " society " when he had such contempt for Boston ? " I do n't even dislike it ! " he wrote . Dickinson in all her privacy would have seemed to James as ineffectual as everything else he condescended to in the New England he had long put behind him . Yet to be a " woman writer " was in nineteenth-century New England to be distinguished . In a Maine inn there long hung a group picture of " Our Female Authors . " Some of them had not been photographed with the others but had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fencelike bustles , they clearly strengthened each other against anything one of them might disapprove of . There were Harriet Beecher Stowe and Julia Ward Howe , Louisa May Alcott and Louise Chandler Moulton , Elizabeth Stuart Phelps and Helen Hunt Jackson , Rebecca Harding Davis and Sarah Orne Jewett , Mary E. Wilkins Freeman and Rose Terry Cooke . Looking at that solid phalanx of " authoresses , " most of them ministers ' daughters and ministers ' wives , one silently protested that Harriet Beecher Stowe was a big talent , Sarah Orne Jewett at least a genuine one , and that it was wrong to club them in with women who were merely earnest or merely clever ? or merely women . Henry Adams , who was married to the brightest woman in Washington , had no greater praise for a woman than that she was brighter than her husband . Why were the leading men in America ? men in general ? so lacking in color ? Henry James was stirred to write The Bostonians by the " decline in the sentiment of sex . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's representative figure , Olive Chancellor , is positively military in her resistance to men . This did not save Olive from defeat at the hands of a reactionary ex-Confederate , no believer in women 's equality with men , who took helpless Verena Tarrant away from Olive . Woman 's brightness , as James could never forget about his old friend Marian Adams , somehow lent itself to tragedy . But was a " bright " woman more tragic than the " pure "  | all neurasthenic in the fashion of the time and some of them erratic , like Mary Lincoln and Ida McKinley ? " Bright " or not , all such suffering women ? passive women ? were left so by the absence from their lives of the great American drive for success .

Or violate a Star Meanwhile , the business class sacrificed itself to what William James would call the " bitch goddess . " No wonder Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their women . Emily Dici.nson 's knowledge of men did not include the business class . The Dickinson men ? grandfather , father , brother ? were by profession trustees of a clerical tradition transferred to the education of young men , embodied in Amherst College . Thanks to the invaluable biography of Emily Dickinson by Richard B. Sewall , we know that brother Austin , though Amherst College 's treasurer like his father before him , lacked his father 's iron character . ( He had an affair with the wife of the college astronomer , Mabel Loomis Todd . ) The father was " Squire Dickinson , " a natural leader , the college treasurer for thirty-eight years , a Whig congressman . His daughter said that on Sunday her father read only " lonely and rigorous books . " Courting his future wife , Edward Dickinson told her that he looked forward not to pleasure but to a life of " rational happiness . " When he died , his daughter wrote that " his heart is pure and terrible and I think no other like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the running , which helps to account for the terrible purity of most Dickinsons ? whose type of mind was still clinging to considerations of Immortality in the hoggish times of President Grant . Her being an anachronism was good for Emily Dickinson 's poetry , if not for her rational happiness . The good New England writers left were the last leaves on the Puritan tree . Harriet Beecher Stowe was established as an eccentric ; Sarah Orne Jewett was an exquisite but ultimately too fragile miniaturist of Maine villages and farms , of totally ignorable lives that did not seem to be part of the Age of Enterprise . The more New England became a tradition , like Cornwall and Brittany , the more its heavy sense of its own past , of its intellectual virtue and moral fractiousness , lent itself to subtle historical novels like Stowe 's The Minister 's Wooing . And this before the Civil War ; after it , as James satirized it all in The Bostonians , the great tradition had become a cameo , a photograph album . The Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to write about or to write from . The voice of her poetry is peculiarly immediate , exclamatory , anguished , and antic in its concern ; it is the most concentrated cry for life we are to hear from an American in her time .

To be " attentive , " to be endlessly aware , even with no object or purpose in view , is in Emily Dickinson 's view to be alive , to live a life fraught with danger . To be alive is to be alone with consciousness , and the only resolution is to " see " this to the end . This was a favorite thought of Henry James and , he liked to add , was all his religion . He was to write that the business of the artist was to carry " the field of consciousness further and further , making it lose itself in the ineffable . . . ; that is all my revelation or secret .

" Everything is interior , personal , and just possibly of not the slightest reverberation for anyone else . The whole poem is so closeted in the deepest intimacy that it is also about anonymity . It is the projected " Landscape " that " listens " ; it is " Shadows " that " hold their breath . " And when that certain Slant of light finally goes , " ' t is like the Distance / On the look of Death " ? the dead person is visually alone and apart . The us struck by " Heavenly Hurt " has been all alone , but this poem of meticulous consciousness shows the " distance " indeed between us and death . Whitman " praised " Death . Dickinson took on the last passage of life and thought before nullity took over . Victorian America made a ceremony of what has been called " the snug sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying in company ; this was supposed to provide consolation . There was a vast " consolation literature " that rose to expected heights in describing the serenity with which the faithful faced death : the dying had to do it right so as to assure the survivors . This was not always possible . Walt Whitman 's brother Andrew was reported in the family to be " very desirous of having us around him when he died . The poor boy seemed to think that that would take nearly all the horror of it away . " A violent death , such as Melville delighted to put into Moby-Dick , seemed hostile to the spirit of consolation so natural to the Christian Republic . The almost one million casualties in the Civil War could be treated sacramentally by noncombatants like Walt Whitman , but survivors like Ambrose Bierce and Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. , were sardonic on the subject .

Ah ! the dreamless sleep ! Death was a public event . It was awful but an occasion . What fascinated Dickinson was the ebbing away that nothing could conceal , the private doubts and open terror that piety could not absorb . Something like amuse-  | But in the day-to-day struggle that made up her life and became her text , death was the great weakening , the most intimate diminution of the strength necessary to her frail body and uncertain morale . It raised every possible question about our destiny while providing minute omens of future dissolution .

Thoreau was wonderfully haughty about its lack of connection with him . " How plain , " he once wrote to Emerson , " that death is only the phenomenon of the individual or class .

" Thoreau ended his beautiful prose poem , the book of total aspiration that he identified with his life , on Spring and one other symbol of resurrection : Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England , of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood , which had stood in a farmer 's kitchen for sixty years , first in Connecticut , and afterwards in Massachusetts , ? from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still . . . .

" Since " time " was something more to her than her one possession , it was not something to be " eclipsed . " God , she wrote to Higginson , was an eclipse ; she alone in her family was not in the habit of asking Him for anything . God was idea , not a person . He was the greatest longing . " God is the name of my desire , " Tolstoy told Gorky . And if He was not always real , death was . Death turned life itself into an idea ? it became the final idea as well as our idea of everything final . Dickinson could not limit death to a " law " ? or " praise " it , as Whitman  | life , hearing of death every day in that Civil War year that saw her write more poems than there were days , she lived intimately with death , as people used to do in the nineteenth century . It was not something you could omit from the day 's register . But neither was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher realm . " But it was certainly a bridge . How , when you came to it , to approach and seize it for what it had to say to you as the next stage of consciousness that was still the task of life ? What fascinated Dickinson the poet was each detail of the dying consciousness . Her lifetime investment in the poem as miniature made her see that only the barest lyric could render so much finality , the purest personal fantasy of travelling into death with the mind radiantly poised for novelty . Prose fiction can include such a theme but soon passes over it . The poem and the journey into death would have to be identical in order to make the humility of the human state the real feature of the work .

The horses ' heads were toward Eternity ; there is no going back . The effect of the poem is " dying " ? stanza by stanza we see less and less of what we are passing through , what is soon behind us . We passed the School , where Children strove At Recess ? in the Ring We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain ? We passed the Setting Sun What that famous Eternity is we can not say .

His father , a transplant from Virginia to Missouri who failed to make anything out of the " Tennessee land " he had once bought , talked his family into the dream that the land would yet make them rich . Talk would become the son 's favorite show of power . Long before he " astonished " all those drifters , prospectors , gamblers , and other stray journalists in Nevada , young Sam Clemens in Hannibal must have sounded like his Tom Sawyer ? amazing the home folks by his inventiveness and spiel . His style was formed on his lifelong relish of himself as a performer . And forever pushing the performer into action was this perennial boy 's awareness of being a favorite , a star . He expected people to hang on his words , and he always meant to " astonish " them , to take them over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got into Huckleberry Finn , the violence of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court . He was the favorite , the winner , the Jim Dandy all-American boy ( and man : in old age his entourage spoke of him as " King " ) . Like many another " real live nephew of my Uncle Sam , " he was always on stage ; his delivery was sardonic and his message the wisecrack . All in the " American " style . And what was that style , now , but " irreligion , " scepticism in all things , dissolution in any direction of the eternal verities ? No one before the Civil War , no one not from the West , would ever have mustered the poker face to get away with " the calm confidence of a Christian with four aces . " In Mark Twain everything went to express suspicion and to conceal hostility  | byterian scornful of sky-blue transcendental Yankee idealism , a poor boy from a family that still believed itself to be " quality , " and he was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An overpowering egotist as well as an always vulnerable one , he had acquired in mining camps , saloons , and newspaper offices a bumptiousness , a special swagger . He was everlastingly the verbal winner , the fastest mouth in Virginia City , San Francisco , and Hawaii . What formed Mark Twain 's perennial " act " was the underplayed but unmistakable attack on belief and believers . No matter how friendly he remained to the end of his life with the Reverend Joe Twichell , no matter how often he assured " Livy " that he might yet be as content with churchgoing as others in their prosperous Hartford set , a preeminent object of his many dislikes was the church , churchgoers , prayer meetings , and the complacent banalities of established clerics . A profoundly middle-class soul himself for all his mischievousness , the very type of the boastful , loud , frantically unsure promoter , he used his " low " experiences to needle the " quality " without for a moment sacrificing the aggressiveness of the one and his respect for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his histrionic expressions of guilt at being a divided soul , were the predicament that he turned into his greatest feat . Mark Twain never ceased to be Mr. Clemens . What rankled most ( in a nature that luxuriated in irritations ) was Christianity 's assumption of unity , of a creation overseen by Providence . The truth was not in any organized body or systematic belief , for there was no single truth . It was certainly not in the mind alone , as Emerson had preached . There was nothing but the mixed-up pieces of our raw human nature . This realism was crucial to Mark Twain 's enduring popularity ; after Cooper , he was the first significant American writer to whom people turned just for pleasure , without thought of improving themselves . Just as his one great book is an example of what the French call le roman fleuve , the novel which carries life along like a river and is as wayward as the great river that flows through Huckleberry Finn , so his genius was always in some sense for the circumstantial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early American classic would seem too ardent . His large , ever-larger audience , in Europe as well as in America , made him the most loved and the best rewarded of American writers . His humor ? always on the attack ? was certainly not " ardent " about anything . l le lacked the intellectual will to give life one dominating shape . I Iis work required none of the training needed to meet Captain Ahab when the great man ranted , " Who 's over me ? Truth  | Mark Twain 's famous " naturalness , " his ability beyond anything else to give an episodic quality to life , spoke to a generation not altogether alarmed by the recognition that there was no necessary connection between man and the universe . His genius for improvisation was as important as his instinct for ridicule . Nothing he ever wrote ? not even the determinism of What Is Man ? and his other outcries in old age against the old American confidence and self-approval ? was deliberated for a pilgrim race to make use of . His worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his projects resembled promoters ' schemes in Western lands that came to nothing . He thought Joan of Arc his best book . Huckleberry Finn was dropped for six years on the principle that " as long as a book would write itself , I was a faithful and interested amanuensis and my industry did not flag , but the minute that the book tried to shift to my head the labor of contriving its situations and conducting its conversations , I put it away and dropped it out of my mind . " When he picked it up again , he did not understand how much this novel-as-river had been moving in some deep channel of its own . Before he turned the last ten chapters over to Tom Sawyer , he established in the book 's harshest scene , the murder of Boggs and the simplicity of the people in this " little one-horse town in a big bend , " the hateful yet comic truth written entirely from inside Southern society . Emerson dreamed that the earth revolving in space was an apple and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb the world into oneself , Mark Twain made the world laugh as he exposed the rawness and deceitfulness of human nature . He softened the awful truth by enjoying his own performance so much . There was nothing to fear ? not yet . Mark Twain darkened only as the century did . The performer kept a certain lordly air , like Colonel Sherburn in Huckleberry Finn deriding the mob come to lynch him , even as he paraded the new Western frontiersman . He flourished in all possible American worlds and was free to comment on anything in his own way . He was a dissolvent of the old ways while unmistakably keeping some privileged independence and , like a good Southerner , his ancestral place . Henry James is supposed to have said that only primitive people could enjoy Mark Twain . Mark " Twain was always more popular in England than James , who was not popular there at all . He was a favorite on the Continent , where James would never have an audience . Of course " delicious poor dear old  | tive " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? of all Victorian amenities . But growing up with the country , as James never did , absorbing its unrest , its extremes of poverty and wealth , its crudest lust for power and position , he naturally identified himself with the many Americans who were forever fighting it out , just barely keeping their heads above water . James gave primacy to his own impressions ; this made Europe sacred as the favorite source of his impressions . Mark Twain 's first book , The Innocents Abroad ( 1869 ) , typically took him to Europe and other holy places as a destroyer , the " American vandal . " These two major storytelling talents , of a time and place when realistic fiction began to dominate our literature , did not feel that they were living in the same time or place . They could not read each other . Mark Twain said he would rather be " damned to John Bunyan 's heaven " than have to read The Bostonians , conceivably the one James novel he might have attempted for its , satire on respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not read fiction at all ; he preferred biography and history , fact books . The genius of fiction and the waywardness of nineteenth-century America permitted James and Mark Twain to make contraries of storytelling , of form , of literature itself , while retaining their parity as individualists . In the end both came to what James called " the imagination of disaster " ? James because his conservative " tradition , " sacred Europe , was as corrupt as anything else ; Mark Twain because nothing failed him like success . But disasters were only the outer shell of capitalism , the great God of chance , the Balzac novel of grandeur and decline that every ambitious nineteenth-century soul lived through . James , who was to say that the starting point of all his work was " loneliness , " tried to find in society imaginatively considered what he despaired of finding in lasting affection . Mark Twain came to say that " the greater the love , the greater the tragedy . " Even the women in his family were too frail to support his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then died on him . But James and Mark Twain were certainly Americans of their time and place . Both began life under the rule of overwhelmingly religious fathers : James became indifferent to organized religion , Mark Twain hostile . Both were wanderers from earliest age ; both were significantly without the conventionalizing university stamp that our bravest speculative minds ? Whitman , Melville , Dickinson ? were also free of . Both became preeminent literary figures very early , always with some audience for James , an eager one for Mark Twain , and were indefatigable producers into their seventies . Both were star writers for the new magazines that made fiction a going concern  | to the mainstream of fiction in English ; both felt in old age that their audiences had not kept up with their originality and independent force . Both , despite their great success in society , their attraction ( Mark Twain 's was magnetic ) for the great and powerful , ended up American isolates like Hawthorne , Melville , Dickinson , Whitman . Mark Twain 's harshly Calvinist father died broke when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searing memory of having to look at his father 's corpse ? no doubt because it exposed the ultimate humiliation of the human body . He was a wandering printer in his teens , a newspaperman , a silver miner , an editor , a correspondent , a professional humorist , and finally , after a practical and respectable Victorian marriage , a newspaper owner , property owner , and best seller on the subscription system . This fabulous American career , representing America to itself , made Mark Twain the legendary example of what his friend William Dean Howells called the post ? Civil War type ? " the man who has risen . " Unlike the general type , Mark Twain became the man who saw through the pretenses of society . The frontier , Howells said , made Mark Twain more " the creature of circumstances than the Anglo-American type . " It broke up all cultural traditions even when it wanted to respect them ; it was derisive of the consolations of religion even when it retained the church as an institution and a social control ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venerated the profit motive , the predatory character , the rich strike , and the eventual domination by monopoly . It took violence as the proof of manhood , made a cult of woman , the " good " woman , at a time ? as you never learn from Mark Twain ? when whoring as well as boozing and gambling were the chief distractions from prospecting . The frontier , having no tradition , worked on images of the past like acid . It also created the picturesque figure of the liar , the deceiving teller of tales , the professional hoodwinker of the innocents back East . The West became an idyll even when ? sometimes because ? its inescapable savagery could not be concealed . It became a fundamental article of romance for some new realists . His assiduously pleasing friend Howells , from the old Western Reserve ( Ohio ) but long since merged into Boston , adored " Clemens " ( the two were always " Clemens " and " Howells " to each other ) because the Western environment seemed to stick to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep , watching his friend lounge through hotel rooms in the long nightgown he preferred and telling the story of his life , " the inexhaustible , the fairy , the Arabian nights story , which I could never tire of even when it began to be told again . "  | man melted into the career , the career into the country , the country into a legend of endless advancement , freshness , gusto . Somehow the legend always came back to the idea of Mark Twain as the perfect American type , a Westerner , " more dramatically the creature of circumstances than the old Anglo-American type . " He found himself placed in them and under them , so near to a world in which the natural and the primitive were obsolete , that while he could not escape them , neither could he help challenging them . The inventions , the appliances , the improvements of the modern world invaded the hoary eld of his rivers and forests and prairies , and , while he was still a pioneer , a hunter , a trapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar , the gentleman . They seemed to him , with the world they represented , at first very droll , and he laughed . They set him to thinking , and , as he was never afraid of anything , he thought over the whole field and demanded explanations of all his prepossessions ? of equality , of humanity , of representative government and revealed religion . When they had not their answers ready , without accepting the conventions of the modern world as solutions or in any manner final , he laughed again , not mockingly , but patiently , compassionately . Such , or something like this , was the genesis and evolution of Mark Twain . Howells , like Mark Twain a self-educated printer and reporter , had learned very early how to play up to Boston 's good opinion when Boston was still authority . Charles Eliot Norton must have been thinking of the smoothly dutiful Howells when he described the writers he knew as " the best that the world has seen . . . the pleasantest to live with , the best-intentioned and honestest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pleased . Mark Twain was an endless surprise and delight to him , he was so " free . " Howells constantly praised Mark Twain 's freedom to Mark Twain even when , reading proof on Tom Sawyer , he sighed over Huck Finn 's saying " they comb me all to hell " and had it changed to " they comb me all to thunder " : " I 'd have that swearing out in an instant . I suppose I did n't notice it because the locution was so familiar to my Western sense , and so exactly a thing that Huck would say . But it wont sic do for the children . " Mark Twain 's endless spoofs and explosive temper were prime contrasts to the fat little man who in one photograph of the two eminent authors is wearing spats while his famously temperamental friend looks as if he is about to tear into the photographer . I n My Mark Twain l lowells purred over Mark Twain dead as he had purred over Mark Twain alive . Mark Twain was not really a pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard Oil Company 's Henry Huddleston Rogers . " Hellcat Rogers , " as he was known on Wall Street , helped rescue him from bankruptcy when the rich and successful Mark Twain lost almost everything trying to get still richer on the ill-fated Paige typesetting machine . While Mark Twain was a satirist of get-rich-quick schemes as early as The Gilded Age ( 1873 ) , " the genesis and evolution of Mark Twain " can hardly be credited to his demanding " explanations of all his prepossessions ? of equality , of humanity , of representative government and revealed religion . " He ended up an angry and rebellious critic of many American beliefs , but only after he had come to feel that they had betrayed him . Howells ended My Mark Twain : " Emerson , Longfellow , Lowell , Holmes ? I knew them all and all the rest of our sages , poets , seers , critics , humorists ; they were like one another and like other literary men ; but Clemens was sole , incomparable , the Lincoln of our literature . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And it is true that Mark Twain , like Lincoln , was a Westerner , a type which , as late as 1925 , F. Scott Fitzgerald could hymn at the end of The Great Gatsby as the soul of honesty fated to be corrupted by the East . Like Lincoln , Mark Twain was restless and ambitious for the main chance before he knew what it was . Growing up in America 's border country , a drifter in a generation of drifters , Mark Twain could have said , as Lincoln did during the Civil War , that he was never really in command of events . And if he seemed to have sprung out of the American ground , as Lincoln did , he also knew a hidden America of emptiness and secret terror . The celebrated funnyman was " often crazy in the night " and , like Lincoln , suffered the melancholy and unrest that deprecated self and told jokes . Unlike Lincoln , Mark Twain was a booster , believed for the longest time that success was his destiny , and was enraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost too late , he did not know what it was like to stand apart from the circumstances of his life . He could describe them dynamically , picturesquely , but until life took him by the throat and amazed him by frightening him , he saw no alternative to the American epic of progress . His genius , his special luck , was to offer himself up as a new environment . Turning his friend into " the Lincoln of our literature , " Howells slighted an important aspect of Lincoln : his rationalism , objectivity , fixity of purpose . Lincoln never had a personal God ; as he admitted in his greatest public utterance , the Second Inaugural , " the Almighty has Ilis own purposes . " This represented to Lincoln not chance but a divinity which he humbly  | feel that it was worthwhile living in a universe in which could be detected some mysterious tendency toward justice . Mark Twain 's world was all personal , disjointed , accidental . He was indeed , as Howells said , the " creature of circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures of chance in a world more sceptical than had been seen before in the literature of " God 's own country . " " Circumstances " made Mark Twain , and the shock and fascination of them in succession gave the airy tone to his work . His genius lay in accumulating episodes ; he turned life into a stream of facts and pictures ? comic , unpredictable , exaggerated , wild ? without overall meaning , without ideology , without religion . From the beginning , Mark Twain 's real subject ? against a landscape of unlimited expectations and constant humbling ? was the human being as animal nature , human cussedness taken raw , single traits magnified as fun , pretense , burlesque , spectacle , and violence . He took from the blatant demonstrativeness of frontier humor its central image of man undomesticated , removed from his traditional surroundings ? a stranger wandering into a thin and shifting settlement of other strangers , then plunging into a dizzying succession of experiences always " new . " Mark Twain is the ancestor of all that twentieth-century fiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of step with American moralism and pious abstractionism . The characters are generally low , and there is no attempt to make them less so . Southern characters just lived , without ostensible purpose , sometimes in mud everlasting , as do the " Arkansaw " characters in that " little one-horse town in a big bend " ? chapter 21 of Huckleberry Finn ? where Colonel Sherburn will shoot down poor , miserable Boggs . This is the poor white 's South before ( and after ) the Civil War , not the plantation house from which Colonel Sherburn scorned the mob . All the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else but mud ? mud as black as tar , and nigh about a foot deep in some places ; and two or three inches deep in all the places . The hogs loafed and grunted around , everywheres . You 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave her ears , whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary . And pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , " hi ! so boy ! sick him , Tige ! " and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more a-coming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun  | a dog-fight . There could n't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog-fight ? unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death . Mark Twain , as he could have said , " sort of specialized " in characters who " just lived " ? who perhaps lived to talk . They talked all the time , performing for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic imagination in talk . What other writers always noticed about Mark Twain was how professional he was with them , tailoring himself to a particular audience . He talked as he wrote , wrote as he talked , to the point of developing the most " lifelike " " right " rhythm in sentence after sentence of just the right length , with always the telling emphasis in just the right place . He talked and talked so inexhaustibly at any audience that in his regular changes of mood he felt sheepish and even guilty for making such demands on everyone within earshot . But talk was the way he lived and in a sense what he lived for . As he said in his account of his brief and inglorious time as a Confederate volunteer , " The Private History of a Campaign That Failed , " he was " an experienced , industrious , ambitious , and often quite picturesque liar . " Everything came out of the " perversest twang and drawl , " that endless flow of words , sweet and right in its rhythm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never picturesque but became a dainty and unerring Victorian stylist , had also learned the right use of words at the type fount and the newspaper desk . Those once selfeducated , literature-mad American writers and speechifiers ! Howells knew that his friend 's extraordinary power to write as cleverly as he talked represented a tapping of the half-conscious mind in its most relaxed rhythm . It seemed to Howells that no other writer had ever captured the elusive spontaneity of the human mind . Near the end of his life Mark Twain dictated from bed the fragmentary , supposedly daring passel of unrelated reminiscences and anecdotes he called his Autobiography . There he spoke of his instinctive method . With the pen in one 's hand , narrative is a difficult art ; narrative should flow as flows the brook down through the hills and the leafy woodlands , its course changed by every boulder it comes across and by every grass-clad gravelly spur that projects into its path ; . . . a book that never goes straight for a minute , but goes , and goes briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mile around ... but always going , and always following at least one law , always loyal to that law , the  | law of narrative , which has no law . Nothing to do but make the trip , the how of it is not important , so that the trip is made. * Where did Mark Twain learn to write like that ? To catch on paper , as he did in speech , the exact cadence of words as they fall within the mind ? Of course the South produced great talkers , and like so many of its vehement personalities up to and including Lyndon Johnson , they knew how to apply pressure on people . Mark Twain must have learned very early that the mouth must always be ready . The celebrated funnyman began as a bookish , sensitive , undersized , violently moody youngster who learned how to defend himself , then ? like Tom Sawyer ? to command a situation by throwing in occult references , interspersing a string of words between himself and every bit of trouble at hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on the right word , was something more distinct , and purer , than the traditional gift of gab . Mark Twain 's instinct is for the sentence , the thunderclap of surprise essential to the monologist ? an effect usually more suited to the short poem , which must be all style , than to prose fiction . He knew , as Robert Frost was boastfully to put it , that " a sentence is a sound on which other sounds called words may be strung . " A sentence in Mark Twain , as in Frost , is above all a right sound . Hemingway , for all his homage to Huckleberry Finn as the initiator of modern American writing , was a rhetorician who brought an ironic and brutal simplicity to a style not " natural " like Mark Twain 's but ostentatiously reduced . Hemingway ( like Thoreau ) does not try to capture the spoken sound of a sentence . You can sense him checking his own spontaneity as he writes . He is a painter , a whittler , not a listener . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periphery of conscious- *The Autobiography was to be published only after his death , for " only dead men tell the truth . " In a footnote to the " Aldrich Memorial , " his description of the reluctant journey he and Howells made to the memorial for that eminently forgettable man Thomas Bailey Aldrich , Mark Twain was so alarmed that readers would learn that he disliked Mrs. Aldrich that he footnoted : " At this point I desire to give notice to my literary heirs , assigns and executors , that they are to suppress , for seventy-five years , what I am now about to say about that curious function . It is not that I am expecting to say anything that shall really need suppressing , but that I want to talk without embarrassment and speak with freedom ? freedom , comfort , appetite , relish . " t " You have to be able to dominate the existence that you characterize . That is why I write about people who arc more or leas primitive . " ( Flannery O ' ( ' emnor to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow managed not to stumble even when he composed in rhythms that were not only removed from ordinary speech but were inconceivable from anyone but Henry James . Frost could have been speaking for Mark Twain when he wrote in a letter , " The vital thing , then , to consider in all composition is the ACTION of the voice , - sound ? posturing , gesture ... . Why was a friend so much more effective than a piece of paper in drawing the living sentences out of me ? . . . I ca n't keep up any interest in sentences that do n't SHAPE on some speaking tone of voice . " Some speaking tone of voice became the everyday voice of Mark Twain as he wrote . And what he heard in himself was often mimicry . The edge in people 's voices , their littlest emphases and explosions , was something he could never resist putting down . They were the little " snags , " in the mouth as on the river , the clots natural to speech before it floods on . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything on the Mississippi , how to make words reproduce the river ? " and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there 's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way . " But much of the line in a character 's mouth is mimicry of every quantity of sound Mark Twain got down from someone 's speech . " The streets was full , and everybody was excited . " " The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore . But we did n't see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and more . " Mark Twain 's often shrewish voice can be heard in Colonel Sherburn 's scorn of the mob flocking up to his gate to lynch him after he has contemptuously murdered Boggs . The all-assertive inflections , the complacent self-reference , the unsparing absoluteness of every ad-hominem shot , is straight from the repertoire of Southern vocal duelling , public insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amusing . The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man ! ... Do I know you ? I know you clear through . I was born and raised in the South , and I 've lived in the North ; so I know the average all around . The average man 's a coward . " The pleasure we share in all this assertiveness is the pleasure of command ? to command attention , to command the crowd . Mark Twain was sometimes " radical " when things went against him ; he was no egalitarian . It is the eternal ego power of Tom Sawyer , that nonstop performer , that the old Mark Twain came to recognize in another show-off , Theodore Roosevelt , and heartily detested . No doubt with something of a twinge , for in old age , when he resembled King Lear more than he did Tom Sawyer , he called himself " an old derelict " and " God 's fool . " But the everlasting type , the  | to trick and direct others , is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain ; the boy makes his way and always has his way by words alone . What pleasured Mark Twain most about youth ? and this is the genius of Huck Finn , who is also no mean talker and a ready deceiver ? is its capacity for first impressions , the aspect of discovery . Mark Twain 's fellow Missourian T. S. Eliot , reading Huckleberry Finn in late middle age for the first time , noticed that the adult in Mark Twain was boyish , " and only the boyish side adult . " The boy seems to have learned very early in life how to " handle " adults as well as the boy gang with words . His " angelic , " decidedly mature , easily suffering wife sighingly called him " Youth . " " It is a pity we can not escape from life when we are young , " Mark Twain wrote when he was seventy-one . His two most famous creations , Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , never had to grow up. * They remain eternally boys ? the American boys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they convey a fabled freedom . Now virtually enshrined in time and place , the " old " Southwest frontier on the edge of the Mississippi , they seem to represent forever the newness of a new country . Although no other writing in America has made boyhood seem so idyllic , a state sufficient unto itself , Mark Twain 's own boyhood in Hannibal was secretly contradictory in feeling , often touched with dread . The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( the ingratiatingly offhand title ) is for the most part , but not entirely , an equally chummy portrait of boyhood against a setting almost mythic in its selective use of the past . Mark Twain said that the book was " simply a hymn , put into prose to give it a worldly air . " But when Howells , who counselled that the book be directed to children , allowed himself to wonder " why we hate the past so , " his friend responded from the depths , " It 's so humiliating . " The forty-year-old who composed Tom Sawyer in 1875 ? 76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not from the vehement uncertainties that were as much a mark of his character as his aggressive humor .

He was one of the most public characters in America ; somehow everyone knew how happy and prosperous Mark Twain was as he doted on his wife and four children and " humorously " complained of what it cost him to keep up in Hartford the large , overdecorated , ornately stuffed Victorian mansion . The house was another one of Mark Twain 's many fantasies come to life . It had everything that the genteel tradition required of a successful man , but like Mark Twain himself for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first house in Hartford with a telephone ; Mark Twain was the first eminent American writer to possess a typewriter . There was a large staff ; their flamboyant employer alternately boasted and cringed at what his servants cost him when he compared his laundry woman 's wages with what his family in Hannibal had lived on . The Hartford enclave , Nook Farm , was literary , prosperous , clerical ? " the quality " to the life . For a poor and once " shiftless " boy who at thirteen had been apprenticed to the local newspapers , and at eighteen had started his wandering career as a printer in St. Louis , New York , Philadelphia , Muscatine , Keokuk , and Cincinnati , Mark Twain at forty was certainly that post ? Civil War type , " the man who has risen . " And he had done it all through words ? which at times made him feel that everything he had gained by quicksilver cleverness , the stage drawl and the platform manner , was unreal . His life resembled a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition to think of his life as a " dream " ? the American dream , of course , but one that also revealed a writer 's tendency to wonder whether the thoughts and projects that occupied him day and night had any existence outside himself . At the end of his " wonderful century " whose many wonders he personified to his countrymen , he was to write in The Mysterious Stranger that the universe itself was a dream , thus rounding out a century of American solipsism . In Nook Farm , Hannibal itself became a dream . The proud , opulent , but endlessly reminiscent Mark Twain was writing Tom Sawyer in the smug atmosphere of postwar Republicanism ; the ragged Confederate volunteer was now a favorite orator at reunions of the Grand Army of the Republic. * He could not help touching up the past , to the point where it would all come No one in the North became so publicly admiring of General Grant , " who can not deliver himself of even the simplest sentence , " as the sprightliest of word-men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rant as the greatest but most nurdest of warriors .

Postwar America was already looking to the " old West " for a golden age . Our now-celebrated author had revisited Hannibal on a sentimental journey ; he had gone up and down the great river to write his utterly sunshot pieces for the Atlantic Monthly on learning to be a steamboat pilot , Old Times on the Mississippi .

He recognized the melancholy limitations of his old life ? how remote and isolated a village like " St. Petersburg " in Tom Sawyer could be , and how it forced " good " people together . ( The " good " people furnish the authority figures in the town , and Tom Sawyer knows how to overcome them from time to time without displacing their authority , which he needs more than anything else to keep him perpetually in adventures . ) The sunny togetherness of the town is really everyone 's similarity ; it excludes people different in " blood , " like Injun Joe , the villain of Tom Sawyer , who is only half Indian but like a good citizen knows " the Injun blood ai n't in me for nothing .

Mark Twain had great trouble deciding whether Tom Sawyer was for children or for adults . In 1876 , when he finally decided that it was a " children 's book , " the contrast between the respectable life he led and the untiring devotion of his hero to fun and games made it necessary for him to be arch to keep a proper distance from his brat . Archness is all over Tom Sawyer .  | Tom Sawyer in order to make Nook Farm real . There may have been some obscure guilt as he hobnobbed with the genially prosperous literati , preachers , and businessmen .

Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one about an irrepressibly imaginative boy who could make other boys submit to his ( booklearned ) fantasies . It was a story to be told at a comfortable remove . The archness fitted the benevolence of middle-aged successes toward their younger selves , of urban leaders toward the old farm and the rustic village . Heavily Victorian Americans could feel that America was still young . Now that the dire Calvinist suspicions that children were as damnable as everyone else were done away with , boys and girls emerged sweet and cute , lovable and cherishable ? as nice and as good , in short , as grownup Americans . The growing comfort and self-satisfaction of middle-class life made happy families dote on their children as never before . There was little religious consolation when they died ? Mark Twain was to lose three , and the death of one particularly beloved daughter at twenty-four was a shock he never got over . Anxiety in prosperity made the now-lovable American child as significant a type as the " shrewd " self-respecting Yankee .

Henry James in the last , unfinished volume of his autobiography , The Middle Years , described the passing of youth as a raid on " the enemy country , the country of the general lost freshness .

" No wonder that Mark Twain in Connecticut remembered the raw Missouri of the 1850s so fondly in Tom Sawyer as a place where children had no life but play .

And it was Howells who had him remove innocent bits of real life from the novel ( Becky sneaking a look at a naked body in teacher 's anatomy text ) as " awful good but too dirty . " Howells always knew what the public would take , and he wrote straight to this public , whose inquiring photographer in fiction he was for so long that he felt he had been created by the reading public . Nowhere as in America after the Civil War were there so many books for adults about children having fun . If the prosperous middle class in the United States already impressed European visitors as a society somehow geared to children , that was because it showed how prosperous , easy , and self-indulgent , how happy , prodigal , and young , adults could remain in America . The young had become the real Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . A child 's high expectation of life , his high spirits and his general air of having a surplus vitality that , like surplus cash , had to be spent , proved the extraordinary good fortune that so many Americans were experiencing . The splendor of children in American literature of the time ! Obviously some Americans felt as protected as only children ever do . In Tom Sawyer Mark Twain was not yet ready to disclose the deep as well as the bright side of a Mississippi River boyhood . He celebrated boyhood as a state sufficient unto itself , almost entirely removed from the contingencies of the adult world . It is removed even from the looming sexuality of childhood and adolescence . When he revisited Hannibal and climbed Holiday 's 1 Iill w get a comprchen-  | happenings of life were not the natural and logical results of great general laws , but of special orders , and were freighted with very precise and distinct purposes ? partly punitive in intent , partly admonitory , and usually local in application . " ( Mark Twain could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and writing down . ) The world of Tom Sawyer is indeed under " special orders " ? not only from adult to boy but from boy to boy . In imagination it is limited so generously to the wishes of boyhood that from one point of view it is unreal , which explains why Tom Sawyer himself , as well as his adventures , has become legendary . This boyhood will seem forever special to itself , privileged , a sport . There is no real family life in the book ? Tom 's mother is dead , he is being raised by his Aunt Polly ; the father is never mentioned ; nor do we ever find out why Sid is only Tom 's half-brother or why cousin Mary seems to live in the same household . Joe Harper and other boys in the gang do have families ? at least they have mothers , and thus God-fearing homes . Huck Finn is the exception to all this . His father is the town drunk , and Huck has no home at all . Huckleberry came and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet ; he did not have to go to school or to church , or call any being master or obey anybody ; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose , and stay as long as it suited him ; nobody forbade him to fight ; he could sit up as late as he pleased ; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall ; he never had to wash , nor put on clean clothes ; he could swear wonderfully . In a word , everything that goes to make life precious , that boy had . So thought every harassed , hampered , respectable boy in St. Petersburg . But Huck as exception to the respectable world of St. Petersburg is of only slight importance in Tom Sawyer . Tom is the driving force of the gang . Tom the " bad " boy ? the supposedly bad boy , the predictably good boy ? is not so much " bad " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he is because he reads " pirate " books and such , then tries to make his pranks ( and those of the gang ) live up to them . Mark Twain as a famous author confessed that he did not care to read fiction . The young Sam Clemens in I lannibal must have read himself sick on stories of pirates , Robin Ilood , medieval knights and ladies . ( I lc was  | author 's greatest fantasy : to turn life into a book . Of course there is a good deal of routine , boys-will-be-boys mischief . " And when she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish , he hooked ' a doughnut . " Tom must get the best of every encounter , confrontation , negotiation . Sceptics may see a future corporation type in Tom 's ability to swap his inferior store of boy 's goods ? " twelve marbles , part of a jew 's harp , a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through . . . a dog-collar but no dog " ? for stuff slightly less inferior . His chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) intrigues , is his unquestioned sense of himself as guide and leader to every other boy in town . He is a born dominator , for he is totally ? as young Sam Clemens must have been ? at the mercy of his imagination . Whatever he has read of that world beyond the village , in which pirates and Robin Hood and medieval knights act out some " gorgeous " code , Tom himself must act out . Other boys follow him because they can no more resist Tom 's wild fancy than we can resist Mark Twain 's . The most famous episode in Tom Sawyer ? Tom 's persuading his friends to pay him for the " privilege " of whitewashing Aunt Polly 's fence ? can be believed only if you recognize what a power of fantasy drives this mighty spieler . Tom can talk people into anything because no one else really shares , much less understands , his determination to live by the book . This gives him a power over them that reminds us of an author 's power . From his guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Petersburg must also participate in the book Tom is acting out ; they are the chorus , plaintive but unavailing , as Tom goes through his adventures . Near the opening of the book Aunt Polly laments the fact that Tom has just ( again ) escaped her control . " He 's full of the Old Scratch , but laws-at-me ! he 's my own dead sister 's boy , poor thing , and I ai n't got the heart to lash him , somehow . I 've got to do some of my duty by him , or I 'll be the ruination of the child . " So Tom can persuade even " hard-eyed " Joe Harper into sailing off with him as pirates to Jackson 's Island . ( Huck Finn " joined them promptly , for all careers were one to him ; he was indifferent . " ) Tom can cajole the other boys into staying on the island when they are homesick ; a great storm seems to bring the end of the world . In the book 's most astonishing scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum while Aunt Polly and Mrs. Harper are lamenting the boys ' death . Tom manages the shattering appearance of the boys at their own " funeral . " As everyone says , you never ( 1ic1 see a boy like him . This writer has never found Tom " lovable . " Tom is so bent on having life live up to his favorite stories that he takes over people 's lives . But like  | Tom 's power . That is the fascination of the book : Tom believes himself irresistible . A main consequence of Tom Sawyer 's being told in the third person is that Tom becomes a direct creation of Mark Twain 's own arbitrary power to make this boy seem forever " special . " Mark Twain keeps him a professional boy , incessantly a boy , nothing but a boy . Tom is so special a boy that even though there are contradictions in his makeup , we can hardly bear to notice them ? so compelling is the overpowering role he has to play throughout as the young prince behind all mischief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two disciples , he at last comes up with " David and Goliath ! " This gets its laugh . But how is it possible for a boy who reads so much , and is forever hearing the New Testament being read at him in school , in church , at home , not to know better ? It is possible because Tom ( like everyone else in the book , even Huckleberry Finn ) is all of one piece , limited to a few traits . As in all true comedy , these traits are trotted out over and again ; the fun depends on the power of repetition . Tom does " grow " in the story from a bad boy into a hero . When Muff Potter is put on trial for murdering Dr. Robinson in the cemetery at night , Tom overcomes his fear and gets himself to court to nail the real murderer , the villainous half-breed Injun Joe . When his adored Becky Thatcher can not keep away from the anatomy book that the schoolmaster secretly keeps in the closet and then accidentally tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " our Tom takes the blame , bears the punishment ? and wins Becky 's " love . " At the end Tom nobly safeguards Becky when they stray away from their friends and can not easily find their way out of the cave . The stolen treasure bestowed on Tom and Huck is their reward for behaving well in a crisis . To conclude the book , Tom even accommodates himself to the adult values he has hitherto defied ; Huck must go back to the Widow Douglas if he wants to be accepted into the gang . ( This proves conclusively that the activity of the gang is really playacting by respectable people . It is necessarily where The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will begin , for Huck is not middle-class and respectable , so he must escape the " Widder . " ) In Tom Sawyer all the shenanigans at the end denote the happy ending and spirit of reconciliation natural to comedy . By writing Tom 's adventures in the third person , Mark Twain could " handle " Tom any way he liked . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his original preface to Tom Sawyer , from f lartford in 1876 , when he was living in such grand style , he wrote : " part of my plan has been to try  | they felt and thought and talked , and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in . " This was not and could not have been all that the floodgates of memory opened up . Tom and his friends are superstitious about many things in a way that shows their dread of the unknown powers behind nature as well as their childish ignorance . Why do they visit a tumbledown cemetery at night just in time to see a grave robbery and murder ? Why does Huck carry a dead cat with him ? Why is a recurrent image in the book that of the moon dropping behind a cloud ? All these people are alone with natural forces that , as in the scene of the terrible thunderstorm , seem to sport with the tiny settlement on the mysterious great river . Tom and Huck , being boys , think they can control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying spells on them . But evil in the background is necessary to comedy , for evil is defeated . Wickedness in the person of Injun Joe dies of starvation in the cave ; the fears of the cave are overcome by Tom and Becky ; our prankster is a hero . He has really been a hero all along ? a hero disguised as a mischievous and disobedient boy . This adds folklore to comedy . Everything works out for the best in this best of all possible Americas . Successful , benevolent Mark Twain is looking back on his own boyhood so sweetly , so archly ! The prose in which Tom is put through his paces could not be more heavily facetious : " he uncovered an ambuscade , in the person of his aunt ; and when she saw the state his clothes were in , her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness . " This is far from being the easy , " natural " first-person style of Huckleberry Finn . Mark Twain had to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could enter more deeply and recklessly into a boy 's life with Huckleberry Finn . There is a lot of carefulness and anxious propriety behind the writing of Tom Sawyer . It now seems absurd for a near-adolescent like Tom to ask Becky for a kiss only because that is the ritual he has read about in books when people get " engaged . " " Now , Becky , it 's all done ? all over but the kiss . Do n't you be afraid of that ? it ai n't anything at all . Please , Becky . " In the closing pages Huck bitterly complains how unbearable he finds life with the Widow Douglas : " She makes me git up just at the same time every morning ; she makes me wash . . . them ways comb me all to thunder . " Since Mark Twain had persuaded himself ( prodded by his wife and Howells ) that the book was really " a boy 's and a girl 's book , " he was glad enough to change " hell " to " thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at in the schoolmaster 's anatomy book apparently belongs to neither sex and contains no sexual interest for Becky .  | boyhood . So much propriety and prudent respectability were perhaps necessary to describe boyhood under " special orders . " Adulthood and boyhood are absolutely divided here between authority figures and escapees from authority . Tom is the immortal boy because there is no chance of his growing up ? of ever becoming anything more than a boy . Tom is everlastingly the type and legend of the American boy because his youthful sense of freedom still represents the youthfulness of the United States ? before Mark Twain settled down . Tom is legendary because he is an adult 's fantasy of defying the many adults we can not defy so lightly when we become adults . Above all , Tom is " immortal " because he always wins . Huckleberry Finn is not middle-class like Tom , and he will never be rewarded for his propriety by the proper people in town . Huck says at one point , " You see , I 'm kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see nothing against it . " Tom has the whole town to defy , for he is securely a part of it . Huck does not even have a home . Everyone disapproves of him in this book , even Tom Sawyer . He is " low company , " the kind of character that stretched Mark Twain 's imagination to the uttermost and became his genius . Still , it had been genius for Mark Twain to put Huck into the company of Tom . Each is so necessary to the other that it was perfect instinct for Mark Twain , once he came to the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , to write The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Huck says at the beginning of the new book , " You do n't know about me , without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer . " When Mark Twain turned to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn after finishing The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876 , he clearly meant to write another " boy 's book " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had carried Tom and his friends in St. Petersburg from one escapade to another . Despite the dread , the fear-soaked superstitions , and the violent deaths described in Tom Sawyer , the book is a comedy and in tone benign and more than a shade condescending to boys who , when all is said and done , are merely boys . Mark Twain had become a wealthy and ultrarespectable member of the best society in I lartford by the time he sat down to recreate his own boyhood in Tom Sawyer ? minus his own religious fear and loneliness . I ! is benevolence toward childhood and boyhood is a little smug . Mark Twain undertook more than he anticipated when he turned to huckleberry  | story in the first person and so at many crucial places in the book became Huck . Yet the facetious " Notice " facing the opening page is only one of many indications that Huckleberry Finn was intended to be just a sequel to Tom Sawyer : Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted ; persons attempting to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a plot in it will be shot . From the moment Mark Twain began to describe things as Huck would see them , and to make of Huck 's vernacular a language resource of the most captivating shrewdness , realism , and stoical humor , Mark Twain was almost against his will forced to go deeper into his own imaginative sense than he had ever gone before . Odd as it may seem , he was compelled ? in this one book ? to become a master novelist . He had not been a novelist at all before writing Tom Sawyer ; obviously everything having to do with his early life in Hannibal recharged him and opened not only the gates of memory and imagination but also his unexpected ability to write close , sustained narrative . Writing in the first person became the deliverance of Mark Twain . Still , given his training in one vernacular style after another during his days as a frontier humorist , it was not in itself exceptional for him to impersonate a fourteen-year-old vagabond , the son of the town drunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas , she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways . " What made the difference between this and just another humorous " oral delivery " was that Mark Twain had fallen completely into Huck 's style and Huck 's soul . ( There were to be passages in which Huck became Mark Twain . ) Smart-alecky and sometimes mechanically facetious as Mark Twain was when he first assumed Huck 's voice , winking at the reader as he presented Huck 's ignorance of religion , of polite language , of " sivilized " ways , Mark Twain would soon be committed to a great subject ? Huck the runaway from his father and Jim the slave running away from Miss Watson , going down the river , hoping to enter the Ohio River and freedom . Freedom from respectable ways for Huck , freedom from slavery for Jim : the quest is eternal even though they miss the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last third of the book they return to the purely boyish world of Tom Sawyer , with Tom the everlasting kid , prankster , brat , forcing a Jim who was really free all the time ( as only Tom knows ) to be a " prisoner " on  | The quest for freedom is eternal because Huck and Jim have nothing in his world but that quest . Mark Twain the ultrasuccess in Hartford had eturned to what he once knew , most feared , and what always excited his magination most ? the Mississippi Valley world at its human bottom , the vorld of the totally powerless and unsettled . He , too , remained something -f a vagrant , a drifter ; in old age he called himself a " derelict . " He would lever , despite appearances , be content with his celebrated position in life ; like ruck at the end of this book , he wanted " to light out for the Territory ahead -f the rest . " Huckleberry Finn is above all a novel of low company ? of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get along only by their wits . n 1885 the Concord Public Library excluded Huckleberry Finn . It was not altogether mistaken when it complained that the humor was " coarse " and hat the substance was " rough , coarse and inelegant , dealing with a series of xperiences not elevating , the whole book being more suited to the slums han to intelligent , respectable people . " The wonderful satire in chapter 1 ' 7 ) n the genteel way of life in the Grangerford family would not be possible without Huck 's unpreparedness for such a way of life ; the hilarious Victorian sentimentality is put into true perspective by Huck , the anguished observer ) f the murderous feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons . Huck has nothing but his wits . As he says about himself , " I go a good seal by instinct . " The society along the river is class-conscious , but the : lasses can not help knowing each other and entering into each other 's lives . n chapters 24 ? 29 the awful Duke and Dauphin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to be its English branch , and the fact that they io not talk " educated , " but make the most ridiculous mistakes , does not alert : he family until it is almost too late . From time to time Huck temporarily Ittaches himself to plain middle-class folks like Mrs. Judith Loftus ; in chapter : 1 , when he disguises himself as a girl , it is his sex rather than his low speech : hat gives him away . Huck certainly gets around . He can be pals with Tom Sawyer and be : aken in hand by Judge Thatcher , the Widow Douglas , and Miss Watson ; Ie convinces Mrs. Judith Loftus that he did grow up in the country ; in Chapter 13 , he steals the canoe attached to the foundering Walter Scott and so helps to send the robbers caught on the boat to their deaths ; he can play : he servant to professional con men like the Duke and Dauphin , who at successive times masquerade as actors , medicine men , and Englishmen . In a great novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : o be whenever Huck and Jim go ashore ? what counts is the reality behind  | Huck ( but only for a self-deluded moment ) , depends always on Huck 's inexperience . Nothing could be more devastating as social satire than the Victorian gingerbread and sentimental mourning described absolutely " straight " by the homeless and admiring Huck . All this turns into a hideous bloodbath as a consequence of Huck 's ingenuous help to the lovelorn couple from feuding families . To go from the Grangerford parlor to the riverbank where Huck covers the heads of the Grangerford boys slain in the insane feud is to travel a social epic . Only the classic " poor white , " Huck , goes the whole route ? as the onlooker that Mark Twain remained in his heart . The riverbank scene ends on one of those recurrent escapes that make up the story line of Huckleberry Finn ? " I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country . " Huck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grangerfords , the Wilkses , the murdering " awful proud " Colonel Sherburn . He " were n't particular " ; he just wants to go " somewheres . " He chooses to stay low company , as his father does . Vagrancy is his first freedom . He does not even choose to go traipsing down the Mississippi with Jim , who just happens to be on Jackson 's Island when Huck gets there . The novel is one happening after another ; Huck happens to fall in with a runaway slave instead of living by the book with Tom Sawyer . As Pap Finn chooses the mud , so Huck chooses the river . Or did the river in fact choose him ? Thanks to the everlasting river , the " monstrous big river , " the always unpredictable river , Huck and Jim on their raft float into a tough American world . It is full of hard characters , crooks , confidence men , kindly widows and starchy spinsters who in good Mark Twain fashion never seem to be sexually involved with anyone ; slaveowners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anything but a piece of property ; pretty young girls for whom Huck 's highest accolade is that they have " the most sand " ? grit and courage , the power to disbelieve and defy the lying elders around them . The church is fundamental to these people , but their religion emphasizes duty to God rather than brotherhood for the outcast and the slave . They are hard without knowing it , for they are hysterically self-protective . They are a human island in the midst of a great emptiness . So Huck , not yet fourteen , has to struggle for a knowledge of adult society without which he will not survive . In Tom Sawyer children and adults lived in parallel worlds without menacing each other ; in Huckleberry Finn , as in real life , children and their elders are in conflict . A middle-class boy like ' I'otn Sawyer has to " win " a game in order to triumph over his inevitable defeats in later life . I luck has to survive now . Ile has to win over  | yer 's boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught ; over the murderous robbers on the Walter Scott and even the protectiveness of Mrs. Judith Loftus ; over the horrible arrogance of Colonel Sherburn and the lynch mob foolishly crowding Colonel Sherburn 's door ; over the greediness of the " King " and the cool cynicism of the Duke . Huck on the river , becoming a part of the river , making the river one of the principal characters , reminds us of the genesis of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . Mark Twain recalled in Old Times on the Mississippi that he had had to learn the whole river in order to become a pilot . Huck has to be the unresting pilot of his life and Jim 's ; he must become the American Ulysses in order to survive . This is why from time to time he can lie back and take in the beauty and wonder of the scene , as in the glorious description of sunrise on the Mississippi that opens chapter 19 . This chapter significantly has the book 's meanest characters , the Duke and Dauphin , coming aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father who wants to keep him down , who tries to rob him , and who beats him and keeps him locked up . Whereupon our Ulysses contrives his own " death " and gets away with it after making as many preparations for his deception and escape as a spy going into enemy country . No wonder he is always on " thin ice , " or as he says in one of his best descriptions of flight , " I was kind of a hub of a wheel . " There , in the struggle of a boy to establish himself over hostile powers , in the discovery of menace when confronting life on one 's own terms ? there is the true meaning of a " boy 's book " ; it explains why boys can read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as boys and then grow up to read it as an epic of life that adults can identify with . The great epic , the tale of the wandering hero triumphing over circumstances ? this is the stuff of literature that a boy is nearest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the form of triumphing over an obstacle . Whether he is planning to deceive his father into thinking he is dead , scaring off slave hunters with stories of smallpox on their raft , or ( in the last ten chapters ) submitting to Tom Sawyer 's games and thus subjecting poor Jim to real imprisonment , the hero of this book is still only a boy . This proximity to both real danger and made-up danger is how life appears to a boy , who must steal from the adult world the power , but also the fun , that he needs in order to keep feeling like a boy . Even though he must trick this world , lie to it , outwit it , he is a boy in his conventional attitudes . The Wilks girl had " the most sand " you ever did see in a girl , and the Grangerford house was the splendidest . Huck does not have the easy out of pretending to despise a middle-class world whose love comes his way without his seeking it . Nor does love from  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he will not admit liking this . You remember his boyish inexperience when you see how much he values , in the sunrise along the river and in the circus into which he has sneaked , the beauty and " splendidness " the world has kept in store for him . The nature of the life experience , as the story of a boy always brings out , is that we just pass through and are soon different from what we thought we were ; are soon gone . Life is.a series of incommensurable moments , and it is wise to enjoy them ; one minute the Grangerford boys are bloody dead along the river , and the next morning or so , " two or three days and nights went by ; I reckon I might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely . " Pap Finn in delirium tremens cries out to the Angel of Death , " Oh , let a poor devil alone ! " This expresses the real struggle , against underlying despair , that Mark Twain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he savagely settled into the despair of his old age . The river that " holds " the book in its grasp is full of menace as well as an unreal floating peace . For the most part travelling the river is a struggle , a wariness , even when Huck is temporarily on land . In the marvellous and somehow central scene in which Huck methodically arranges his " death " and then , worn out , prepares to catch a few " winks , " he is still a river rat who feels himself pursued at every turn . From the very beginning of their flight , Huck and Jim are in ecstasies whenever they are safe for a while . Early in the book , when Huck watches the townspeople shooting off a cannon to raise his " body " from the bottom , he says with an audible easing of his breath , " I knowed I was all right now . Nobody else would come a-hunting after me . " Just treading on a stick and breaking it " made me feel like a person had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got half , and the short half , too . " A boy is up against forces bigger than himself , the greatest of which can be his inexperience . So he has to play " smart . " But the smarter the boy , the more fatalistic he is ; he knows who runs things . Wary of people , Huck weaves his way in and out of so many hazards and dangers that we love him for the dangers he has passed . He is our Ulysses , he has come through . Yet coming up from the bottom , he has none of Tom Sawyer 's foolish pride ; the " going " for this boy has become life itself , and eventually there is no place for him to go except back to Tom Sawyer 's fun and games . The sense of danger is the living context of the book 's famous style , the matchless ease and directness of I luck 's language . I luck and Jim are forever warding off trouble , escaping from trouble , resting from trouble ? then , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing imaginary people in order to get out of scrapes before they occur . As Jim in his ignorance is made to play the fool , so Huck in the full power of his cleverness is made to play the con man . They need all the parts they can get . They live at the edge of a society that is not prepared to accept either one of them ; they are constantly in trouble , and it is real trouble , not " prejudice , " that menaces Jim . Although Mark Twain often plays to the gallery when he mocks the iniquity of slavery from the complacent perspective of Connecticut in the 188os , the feeling that Huck and Jim attain for each other is now deservedly the most famous side of the book . For once , black and white actually love each other because they are in the same fix . " Dah you goes , de ole true Huck ; de on'y white gentleman dat ever kep ' his promise to old Jim . " But we never forget what the hard American world around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For people who are penniless , harried , in real danger of death , vigilance alone gives a kind of magical power to a life over which " mudsills " and slaves have no power . The superstitions Huck and Jim share are all they have to call on against the alien forces of nature . Equally effective , a kind of superstition as well , is the spell they put on things by arranging them in strict order . Although Huck sometimes becomes Mark Twain when Mark wants to satirize old-time property " rights " in slaves , Mark sinks into Huck when , in the crucial scene preparing his getaway , Huck doggedly lists everything he has , everything he is taking with him , everything he knows ? in order to shore himself against danger . It must have been this scene in chapter 7 of Huckleberry Finn that so deeply drew Ernest Hemingway to the book . All modern American writing , he said in Green Hills of Africa , comes out of Huckleberry Finn . He called the much-disputed end of the book " cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . Hemingway surely came to his famous " plain " style through his compulsion to say about certain objects , only this is real ; this is real ; and my emotion connects them . In Hemingway 's great and perhaps most revealing story , " Big Two-Hearted River , " the suffering mind of the war veteran Nick Adams seeks an accustomed sense of familiarity from the stream he fished before the war . He then puts his catch away between ferns , layer by layer , with a frantic deliberateness . So Huck preparing his getaway in chapter 7 tells us : I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with i .. . ; , I , ? ? f I , Tenn ! then the whisky iuft ; I took all the coffee and sugar there  | gourd , I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my own saw and two blankets , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other things ? everything that was worth a cent . I cleaned out the place . I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the wood pile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that . I fetched out the gun , and now I was done . The boy without anything to his name finally has something to carry away . Taking the full inventory of his possessions is a ritual that Huck goes through whenever he is in danger and about to hunt up a new place to " hide . " This element of necessity can be the most moving side of the book . It " explains " the unique freshness of the style as much as anything can . A writer finds his needed style , his true style , in the discovery of a book 's hidden subject , its " figure in the carpet . " Here is a book which is an absolute marvel of style , but in which , by a greater marvel , life is not reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn 's voice has many sides , but fundamentally it is the voice of a boy-man up to his ears in life , tumbling from danger to danger , negotiating with people , and fighting back at things as necessity commands . The sense of necessity that only bottom dogs know is what gives such unmediated , unintellectualized beauty to the style . Mark Twain , fully for the first time , knew how to let life carry out its own rhythm . The interesting thing is that he did not particularly intend to do this . When he took the book up again several years after he had written chapter i6 , planning to describe the comedy and horror of the Grangerfords ' existence , he was tougher on the society along the river than he had ever expected to be . For starting with chapter r7 he had to describe the folly of " quality " folk like the Grangerfords , the inhuman arrogance of Colonel Sherburn , and the stupidity and loutishness of " ordinary " plain people . Mark Twain 's fascinated loathing extends to the whiskey-sodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , foolishly threatening Colonel Sherburn . Because that imperious man murders Boggs , Mark Twain can disgorge himself of his own exasperation with " ordinary " Americans by describing the crowd around the dying man . There was considerable jawing back , so I slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble . The streets was full , and everybody was excited . Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening . One long lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stove-pipe hat on the back of his head , and a crooked-handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood , and where Sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place t' other and watching  | stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sung out , " Boggs ! " and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says " Bang ! " staggered backwards , says " Bang ! " again , and fell down flat on his back . The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened . Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him . The famous speech by Colonel Sherburn after the murder ridicules the crowd that has come to lynch him . The speech is wonderful in its lordly contempt for the townspeople , but of course it is not Sherburn but Mark Twain who is telling the crowd off . The crowd admiringly watching the man in the " big white fur stove-pipe hat " act out the killing is Mark Twain at his best . In this pitiless scene , one of the most powerful blows ever directed at the complacency of democracy in America , life becomes farce without ceasing to be horror . The grotesqueness of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance . And we accept it . The absurdity and savagery that Mark Twain captured in this scene proved more difficult to accept when , no longer young and now humiliated by near-bankruptcy , he found himself face to face with a driving , imperial America that was harsher than anything he had known on the frontier .  | The James Country How can places that speak in general to the imagination not give it , at the moment , the particular thing it wants ? JAMES , The Portrait of a Lady , Preface These Americans never saw Europe : Abraham Lincoln , Henry David Thoreau , Walt Whitman , Emily Dickinson . Whitman , who fascinated the English ( Mrs. Anne Gilchrist settled here for a season in the hope of getting him to marry her ) , might have enjoyed some preposterous celebrity there , as Oscar Wilde did in Western mining camps . It is hard to imagine what Europe would have done for Lincoln or Thoreau . Mark Twain was forever in Europe , and while Europe enjoyed him more than he did Europe , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his imagination . Stephen Crane settled in a moldy , drafty English manor house in order to escape his creditors and to live openly with Cora Stewart ; he died in Germany Margaret Fuller , a restless soul and in intention a revolutionary , escaped her priggish male society ( heavy with second-string transcendentalists ) in Italy . She participated in some epic days of the Risorgimento , became a friend of Mazzini , married the unlettered young Marchese Ossoli , and had a child . All three perished in a shipwreck off Fire Island as Margaret was returning to America . Emerson , who sent Thoreau to look for her effects , was condescending to her in death ; Hawthorne was hostile . Henry James mocked her as " finally Italianised and shipwrecked . " Margaret Fuller , unappeasably critical of male mediocrity in Boston and Concord ( there was as yet no other kind to notice ) , had proved herself unforgivably peculiar . She had gone to Europe on her own terms , the most vivid of our romantic exiles ? as a personality , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in the history of Americans , 1 ? urole became not merely an experience but , to use  | one of Henry James 's essential terms , an " opportunity . " Europe was news , and American writers and artists were still explorers ? like Melville from the South Seas ? bringing home tales of strange places . Scholars of modern languages from George Ticknor to Longfellow and Lowell prepared themselves in Europe for their Harvard professorships . Longfellow , ambitious to bring back to Cambridge everything he could learn , worshipfully saw Europe as the great world . America , for all its freedom and prosperity , soon had almost as many distinguished exiles as czarist Russia . Most of them were pitifully conventional sculptors and artists from notable families ? Henry James was to write their history , with ironic deference , in William Wetmore Story and His Friends . William Dean Howells had never been abroad before he earned the Venice consulate by writing Abraham Lincoln 's campaign biography in 186o . Sitting out the Civil War in Europe gave the self-educated former printer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to produce and the smoothness and poise he brought to his fictional reportage of American society . Europe , Howells 's only university , turned out to be his Harvard Business School , his training in literary management . The tactful , assiduous autodidact was to make it big in Boston by way of Venice . In Howells 's easy , graceful Venetian Life and his essays on Goldoni and Italian comedy , the reader back home is exposed not only to the benefits of foreign travel but to a conscious savor of superiority . He was to decline Longfellow 's and Lowell 's Harvard chair in modern languages . Europe for Howells was his lucky chance to step up from Ohio . For Henry James it was the familiar repository of tradition , art , manners , civilization . It was equivalent to literature itself , and it made possible his career . And his career was his life . It was of course easier for Henry James , with a father airily dissociated from the usual American concerns with business , a " hotel childhood " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boulogne , and Bonn , to think of Europe as a second home . It was easy for him , always , to think of America as not being home . ( And only an American , then and now , has had purely temperamental reasons for thinking so . ) William James said that his brother was an inhabitant of the James family and had no other country. * There was a heightened mental existence to daily life in that country , an abnormal removal from the " vulgar , " that made them strange to *Henry James kept a certain fondness for his birthplace , or at least for his early associations with it . He named the collected edition of his works the New York edition . He remembered " his " New York in his first volume of autobiography , A Small Boy and Others , with special fervor ; in The American Scene with disdain at what it had become . But even his first fifteen years in New York were punctuated by visits to Europe . Ile did not think of New York as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It radiated all too evidently from Henry James , Senior , a belligerently independent religious philosopher and Swedenborgian , a utopian socialist with a private income . He had lost one leg as a boy trying to put out a fire and , being the most uxorious of husbands and the most dedicated of fathers , was happy to be in constant supervision of his family from his writing table . He was described by Ellery Channing as " a little fat , rosy Swedenborgian amateur , with the look of a broker , and the brains and heart of a Pascal . " With his vehement and " vascular " temperament , his contempt for most other American thinkers , his income from an Irish Protestant father who had become rich on Albany and Syracuse real estate after arriving in America a penniless boy wild to see Revolutionary War battlefields , his pride that he and his children were never " guilty " of doing " a stroke of American business , " the father of Henry and William James was known to be independent to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Howells , whose father was a Swedenborgian , wrote that " Mr. Henry James has written a book called The Secret of Swedenborg and has kept it . " The elder James 's problem , which descended on all five of his children ( even the ungifted but equally unstable two youngest boys , Robertson and Garth Wilkinson ) , was spiritual homelessness , a fervid need not easily understood by others to make attachments to a higher consciousness than his own . He was a natural believer who assured his son William that he had never known a sceptical moment . But his God was in no sense an external spirit ; it was the divine principle working itself out in humanity . To know that saved us from being " sick souls , " from falling into the abyss that awaits all unaided human effort , all attempts to escape the " nothingness " of mere self , " the abyss of evil over whom even the best men hover . " That evil expressed itself as despair . There could be no heaven without a hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on regarding himself as self-sufficient . Empirically we know we are creatures with a lack , a destitution , a death in us . Real selfhood comes from God ? and God is the redemption of man in society . This is the " divine humanity " in our " natural humanity " ; it is founded on the solidarity of the race , the " social rebirth of the individual . " Our seeking perfection will " give ourselves no rest until we put on the lineaments of an infinite or perfect man , in attaining to the proportions of a regenerate society , fellowship , and new brotherhood of all mankind . " It was typical of the elder James to say that Genesis was too optimistic .  | The " void " did not vanish when the creation was completed ; we feel it still in our aloneness . Bernard Shaw thought the father was the most gifted member of his remarkable family . Ile was certainly the most influential , for he passed on even his neuroses . The Jameses experienced challenge to their innate beliefs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in revolt against authority ? and the benevolently pervading , all-too-loving father who was always at home was the children 's authority . They were all exceedingly mental beings , sometimes so far removed from actual society that certain of Henry James 's final works , like the unfinished The Sense of the Past , take place in an England that is nothing but a mental elaboration . William James , actually less worldly than his brother for all his " pragmatism , " innocently equated pragmatism with the " cash-value " of an idea . What he was really after was correlation , the human action and effect that should follow from having an idea . They lived in words . For all of them there was an emotional necessity to every particle of expression . It is seen first in the father 's amazing projection of temperament into his wordy pursuit of the divine . He managed to sound excited even when he was most ponderous . Dr. William James 's recorded oscillations , depressions , physical uncertainties ( he was his only patient ) were to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renouvier gave him the confidence to assert his natural belief in moral liberty and freedom of choice . He was like a character in a Dostoevsky novel ? his psyche staged violent ups and downs as he looked to new ideas for his salvation. * Alice James , the youngest child and the only girl , was all her life a prodigal sufferer and medical mystery ; her diary and letters show her struggling against ideas not her own .

No one but James , at the height of positivism , could have counselled " the Will to Believe " as a guide to the perplexed . And only James , lecturing to future professors of philosophy , would have granted religion the status of a " hypothesis " and have then gone on to clinch it with , " deadness and liveness in an hypothesis are not intrinsic properties , but relations to the individual thinker . They are measured by his willingness to act . The maximum of liveliness in an hypothesis means willingness to act irrevocably .

" Self " isolated them . It became their main subject matter . William James , taking a medical degree between nervous collapses , was to work his way through psychology and academic philosophy to achieve his own doctrine and message ? as if , while airily competent in both science and philosophy , he was all the while thinking of curing his own " sick soul . " Henry gave his life to the novel because , above all other forms of literature , it appropriated the endless subtlety of human relationships . " We work in the dark , " the dying writer was to say in Henry James 's story " The Middle Years , " " we do what we can ? we give what we have . Our doubt is our passion , and our passion is our task .

Eventually , with growing isolation even in England , James 's " passion " was to achieve the novel as the form most suited to his consciousness . Unlike the novelists he admired most ? George Eliot , Balzac , Turgenev ? he certainly lacked " saturation " in the life of his native society . He just wanted to be a novelist and read other people 's novels , not only with oversharp eyes but as his main intellectual diet . Even poetry soon bored him . With the precocious sophistication acquired through a childhood in Europe , and his detachment from the commercial cares and interests that dominated his generation after the Civil War , his early work dramatized the tritest love story from the outside , easily worked up a " situation . " Brother William the physician and psychologist emphasized the individual case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some mysterious way which he came to equate with accomplishment  | in the novel , I lenry James was intellectually disengaged , free of " ideas , " forever on his own and left to his own devices. * He turned out to have a great many . From early childhood , absorbed in the bound volumes of Punch and every possible " story book " when the family still lived on Fourteenth Street in New York , James collected images of England , social chronicles and memoirs of the country that most represented a " high civilization . " He practiced his future trade by writing brilliant travel sketches about Saratoga and Newport . Even Emerson was properly impressed by the vividness of his " pictures . " ( James 's extraordinary capacity for images was to exfoliate in his " major " novels of the early I900S until they resembled the superplush , madly overdecorated hotel parlors of the period he satirized in The American Scene . ) The young man began at twenty-one , in the midst of the Civil War , a smooth professional before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine era " after the war gave James his great opportunity as a reporter and practitioner of the new European-style fiction of manners .

Never before had native periodicals been able to count on a body of readers so contained , so full of prosperous self-satisfaction , and so receptive to social fiction ? which brought this class news of itself . The feminine component was described as an " Iron Madonna " chaining writers to women in " society , " their snobberies and inhibitions . James was to lose much of his original popularity when Daisy Miller offended the proprieties ; no " decent " American girl would go about Rome unchaperoned , with a mere Italian .

He was clamorously to describe his aims for the novel as the great form , to confide secrets footnote *Grimly as James came to admire Zola , for example , he could not understand Zola 's leaving his desk to take up the cause of Dreyfus .

The archbishop of Canterbury himself , at a dinner party , had given him the anecdote that became the " germ " of " The ' l'urn of the Screw " ! For the New York edition ( 1907 ? 09 ) of his collected works , James rewrote his earlier novels in his elaborate later style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefaces to each of his principal works and to many of his best stories . With his overflowing articulateness and the flutteriness of his last period , he recounted how the " situation " came to him , where he walked thinking it out , where he sat down to write it , and how this specific work fitted into his master strategy of the high art of fiction . In the end , he confided to Grace Norton , he even thought of writing a preface to his prefaces . His collected letters are as full of his professional avidity as his notebooks , where in his " sacred struggles " he often addressed his writing self , his " genius , " as his only recourse in life . " Without thee , for me , the world would be , indeed , a howling desert . " Late in life James confessed in a letter : " The port from which I set out was . . . that of the essential loneliness of my life , and it seems to be the port also , in sooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This loneliness is deeper than my genius , ' deeper than my discipline , ' deeper than my pride , deeper , above all , than the deep counterminings of art . " The reader has an instinct of this in the familyness of James 's protagonists . As late as the " major " novels , Lambert Strether in The Ambassadors is a widower who has lost his only son ; Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove is an orphan ; and Maggie Verver , marrying an Italian prince with all too many relatives , has to explain that " they had n't natural relations , she and her father . " Why not ? Obviously James identified his better characters , especially his favorite ones , with his own solitariness . Hence their mental precautions ( sometimes it is positive fright ) before other people , their frustrated interchanges , the desperate conjectures which the " witty " dialogue brushes over .

Henry 's " loneliness " and William 's unstable psyche were to lead them to pursue the mystery of personality to every hiding place . And long before James confessed it , it was out of " essential loneliness " that he sprang into furious productivity with such nervous force and cultivated " relationships " as his prime interest in life and art . If he worried that his experience even of New York life was " downtown " with the " pastry cooks , " never uptown in the business world , it was because he wanted to succeed in a " big " American way . His dogged industry and constant anxiety about his career  | remind one of the tireless American entrepreneurs of his generation . I lc was always conscious of the public for whom his fiction was serialized on both sides of the Atlantic , and he certainly meant to satisfy it . Ile had nothing of Flaubert 's horror of the modern audience and gladly tried to educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain what he was up to . To flourish in his chosen field , never to give up in the face of mockery and failure , was his manliness . Henry Adams was proud of not being known to the general public . Mark Twain courted the public endlessly . William James , shifting from field to field before finding himself in middle age , drove himself to document his mature philosophy in one great book but died feeling that he had not fully justified his faith in his own originality . Henry usually justified himself . He had poor digestion and in his early letters from Europe sounds bereft as he moves from one hotel room to another . But he escaped the unsettling illnesses and the even more unsettling political idealism that was marked in his father , his sister , all his brothers . He wrote , he wrote , he wrote . Even when he was dying , he kept chanting sentences aloud , like the dying Emerson . We do not know what Emerson was saying ; James 's secretary did take down those amazing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are mysterious , but they throb with the familiar sonorousness of James 's sentences . Napoleon , Leon Edel has shown in the five-volume biography whose total sympathy reveals James 's fascination for our generation , was a model for James , as he was for many unsoldierly pen pushers . Napoleon was France and France was James 's Olympus , his classical world . James , too , was a " colonial " drawn to the mother country , another ambitious provincial with a great design . His career was one long deliberation of his art and a determination to show himself sui generis ; he meant to be such a novelist as his own country had never conceived , as even " old England " in his time could not match for total devotion , accomplishment , form . James was to become a great original , a powerful critic , the unique portraitist of society on two continents . This was conceded even when , at the height of his powers , he was a problem to such brilliant writers and intimates as Edith Wharton ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wings of the ! love ! " she said to a Scribner 's editor ) , H. G. Wells , Stephen Crane , Andre ( ; ide . When James died in 1916 , T. S. Eliot admitted that James had been dead for some time . In his last years the " Master " was something of a joke , tut isolated that he scorned every popular fiction and " fictionalist . " He became the great dissenter from the disorderly tradition of the English novel , invoked " form " and " composition " at every turn , found Tolstoy and Dosto-  | evsky " loose baggy monsters , " referred to some of his own productions as " almost perfect . " James certainly did not begin with this self-magnification and haughtiness toward other novelists . Like his always obliging friend Howells , with whom he was at first allied in producing the new fiction of manners for the magazines , James adopted a deliberate strategy . His early fiction duplicates Howells 's studied equanimity , his easy irony and delightfully slow pace , everything deliberated as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howells 's gift was for impersonating social tone . He leaves you slightly anxious , of course ; each sentence is such a conscious preparation for the next . He lacks James 's edge . James understood and ( for a time ) even relished his need to please the audience on whom he drew for his material . If " there is something voluptuous in meaning well , " as Henry Adams said , that was certainly Henry James 's voluptuousness . His collected letters wear the reader down with what James admitted was the " twaddle of mere graciousness . " James at the beginning was identified with the new market for fiction , and as he came into his maturity he took it on himself to defend fiction from the suspicion of not having a clear moral purpose . His 1884 essay , " The Art of Fiction , " resonantly invoked freedom for the novelist : " The only reason for the existence of a novel is that it does attempt to represent life . . . . Enjoy the novelist 's freedom as it deserves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , publish it , rejoice in it . All life belongs to you . " James called fiction the most human form of art ? it caught " the look of things , the look that conveys their meaning , to catch the color , the relief , the expression , the surface , the substance of the human spectacle . " The rising market as well as a more professional aptitude for fiction helped to mute the standard objection that fiction had no clear purpose . The modern system of royalty payments took hold about 1880 . The cost of printing fell with the introduction of machine-made pulp paper , the rotary press , steam power , and the linotype machine . National magazines bid eagerly for the rights to new fiction when James was popular on both sides of the Atlantic . Even in Russia the fiction vogue forced novelists to start serializing their novels before they had thought them all out . Dostoevsky complained that he had to write with the copyboy at his shoulder . James T. Fields , owner of the Atlantic Monthly , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . James could afford to give up a share of the family income to his invalid sister , Alice . But he could never hope to make such a business of letters as Howells did . Howells , forever grinding away ( of course he had an invalid  | wife ) , ran his own fiction in the Atlantic when he was editor . By 1HH5 he was able to make this arrangement with Harpers : " For a yearly 3oo-page novel he was to receive $1o,000 in salary for the serial rights , and a 12 ? percent royalty on the finished book . Whatever he wrote for Harper 's Monthly would bring $50 per thousand words , and for Harper 's Weekly , $30 per thousand . " Howells also conducted for six years the " Editor 's Study " column in Harper 's Monthly . He was a steady producer of fiction , essays , travel books , and reviews who complained to his mother and sister back in Columbus that he could not afford to leave his desk . During his prime years Howells made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice satisfied ? though a shade of irony proclaimed his intellectual independence ? the conscious propriety of Beacon Hill . Always working up social topics* ( the businessman , the police station , divorce ) , Howells managed to retain the benevolence of the Brahmins , to inform and edify the largely feminine reading audience , to earn the plaudits of Mark Twain , who obviously found him harmless ( " you are my only novelist " ) , and the polite interest of Henry James . ( Howells was James 's loyal admirer . His admission that he had " never lived " led to the character of Lambert Strether in The Ambassadors . ) Howells , though he soon bored the elite like Henry Adams and exasperated the socially pretentious by his insistence on the ordinary ( " that is the right American stuff " ) , managed dangerous topics as he managed his relations with publishers , the reading audience , and society in Boston . He was a friend to both Mark Twain and Henry James , and who else could have managed that ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some immigrant anarchists in the Haymarket affair and the increasingly brutal influence of American business , rebelled against the self-satisfaction of Boston , moved to New York , and for a time regarded himself as a socialist and wrote with more bite .

One feels about How- footnote *Ford to Egeria Boynton in The Undiscovered Country ( 188o ) : " I 'm serious enough , but I do n't respect my writing as it goes on .

' "  | ells that he trained himself to become a novelist at a time when the novel had become synonymous with magazines as a way of disseminating to the new middle class information about itself . If I lowells had been brought up in the eighteenth century , he would have been a party pamphleteer in America , in Europe a librettist for Mozart 's operas . He was a literary jack-of-all-trades who before the Civil War wrote imitations of Heine and after it social novels based on reportage ? he had come to Boston in 186o as a reporter investigating the shoe trade . He was a literary factotum who knew he could pass muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe during the Civil War , he was able to launch the novel of manners in America . Howells 's concern with the strategy of success would not have been possible without his " literary passions . " He was crazy about writers as well as about books . James always buttered Howells up with faint praise . He appreciated what Howells had done for this newfangled business of describing " society " for itself alone , what Howells 's vogue had opened up for James himself , and how much and in the end how little all this had done for Howells himself . With his head always turned to Europe , James of course thought Howells suburban . As he said in reviewing a routine Howells production , A Foregone Conclusion ( 1875 ) , " Civilization with us is monotonous , and in the way of contrasts , of salient points , of chiaroscuro , we have to take what we can get .

What was monotonous about " my dear native land , " as even Hawthorne had grumbled , was its atmosphere of " commonplace prosperity . " James when twenty-four , lamenting that America was not sufficiently available to fiction , patriotically added : " We must of course have something of our own ? something distinctive and homogeneous ? and I take it that we shall find it in our moral consciousness , our unprecedented moral vigor . " The domestic kind of moral consciousness soon added to James 's vexation about America . As he showed in The Bostonians ( 1886 ) , it could turn cranky , sterile , hard . What James needed were contrasts that could enliven the tame scene and fill up a certain emptiness . In his early biography of Hawthorne , James took up and developed with a flourish what he thought was Hawthorne 's failure to develop . It was proof " that the flower of art blooms only where the soil is deep , that it takes a great deal of history to produce a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a writer in motion .

Why , fourteen years after the federal government crushed the most massive " rebellion " in history , could James write in his l iawthorne study that there was " no State , in the European sense of the word " ? Why , in the midst of a society already feared by James 's adored Britain as its imminent rival , did James suffer for the " very lack of air to breathe " ? James never had to say this , he did not even have to think this until he satirized in The Bostonians the cranks who now represented New England 's religious idealism . He himself had no more respect for church religion than his father did and far less belief in a spiritual world detached from human society . His only faith was in the private consciousness ? not Emerson 's correlation of this with some shadow divinity but consciousness pushed steadily back on the individual himself , as in brother William ? consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other personalities . The " soul " was now a synonym for the individual , not an organ of perception receiving flashes of the divine . There was in fact a great blank where Emerson 's " soul " had so confidently labored . But many Americans were very sure of what James had called their " spiritual lightness and vigor . " " Genuine belief , " Whitman had said in Democratic Vistas , " has left us " ; religion had become sterile , small-minded , and was often faked in the travesty of Emersonianism that became Mary Baker Eddy 's " spirit world . " But Americans , precisely because they were humdrum , middle-middle in the tame bourgeois style that gave James no stimulus to imagination , and socially innocent , were purer than other peoples . This was a drawback to such a " grasping imagination " as James early declared himself to be , by contrast with Howells . The England lacking to poor Hawthorne was a fantasy that would never quite wear out for James even when he lived there : No sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , no palaces , no castles , nor manors ; nor old country houses , nor parsonages , nor thatched cottages , nor ivied ruins ; no cathedrals , nor abbeys , nor little Norman churches ; no great universities nor public schools ? no Oxford , no Eton , nor Harrow ; no literature , no novels , no museums , no pictures , no political activity , no sporting class ? no Epsom nor Ascot ! V. S. Naipaul , another brilliant novelist from the Western hemisphere to settle in England , says that the novel is the product of " highly organized societies . " James 's England was even more " organized " than Naipaul 's is today . When James revisited his native land in the early ( 900S to write The American Scene , he found it not only rather too unorganized for his comfort but resoundingly vulgar . Victorian society made possible this crucial dialogue from The Portrait of a Lady ( 1881 ) ? impossible to imagine in any  | country but James 's dreamland , upper-class England , yet true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and unwittingly prepares the American heroine 's doom : " I want to make her rich . " " What do you mean by rich ? " " I call people rich when they 're able to meet the requirements of their imagination . " What James 's first judges among the Brahmins would not have credited in such a pleasing young man was his secret avidity . To have " perception at the pitch of passion , " to be " saturated , " to " conquer , " " appropriate , " " triumph " ? the intensity of his personal vocabulary becomes as routine in his writing as his hieratic settings . The settings were bestowed on him by tradition , were capable of " transmission , " radiated the " tone of time . " The ever more eloquent and echoing pressure James put into his renderings of Europe reflect an intoxication that even the refrain in his early letters ? " At last I live " ? does not fully convey . " The great thing is to be saturated with something , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James demanded for himself , and eventually thought he had found in England , was a class , a style of life , the presentation of which would produce its effect . Its complexity , he assured himself , would answer to his deepest need as an artist : to bring out the hiddenness of personality . A leisured , upper-class society provided not only the surface that made for contrast with the secret soul but the intrigue that exposed it . James was a snob with a great purpose . Only superior society made possible what he thought of as the necessity and difficulty of discernment . Only the formal routine of " high civilization " made possible the arduousness ( to do a work that would show " the most doing " ) that became his essence of art . So he narrowed himself . Not that he had a choice . In one of the late prefaces he wrote for his New York edition ( of Lady Barberina ) , he admitted that nothing appeals to me more , I confess , as a " critic of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conquests of civilization , the multiplied symptoms among educated people , from wherever drawn , of a common intelligence and a social fusion tending to abridge old rigors of separation . . . . Behind all the small comedies and tragedies of the international , in a word , has exquisitely lurked for me the idea of some eventual sublime consensus of the  | educated .... There . . . in the dauntless fusions to come ? is the personal drama of the future . James 's " discovery of Europe " was that its virtu , its preciousness , was enough to frame a character , to release a story . By contrast , the bareness of American settings had been a special irritant to him . In The Europeans ( 1878 ) the Baroness Munster looks around her Boston hotel room with a grimace at its " vulgar nudity . " In The Bostonians James emphasized " the general hard , cold void of the prospect " overlooking Back Bay . " There was something inexorable in the poverty of the scene , shameful in the meanness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tin and frozen earth , sheds and rotting piles . " The " glare " of gaslight is prominent in James 's America but oddly missing in Europe . Like the lone tourist in so many nineteenthcentury photographs of Italy , James seems to have had Europe all to himself . No wonder he was to fix on a character 's " point of view " as the structure of a novel , and that what had begun as a limitation of experience he was to turn into a base of operations . This was a Europe of imagination indeed , all tradition and background for the starved American senses that could now find in the touch of history , in any street , long-sought opulence for the mind . James 's style grew prodigal whenever he drew a European setting . It shows a mind perfectly pleased , Virgilian in its silky pietas toward the cherished object . There is a purring effect to the opening of The Portrait of a Lady ? James describing the great lawn at Gardencourt at tea time , that most delectable of ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marble summer palaces : " The plain gray nudity of these little warped and shingled boxes seems to make it a hopeless task on their part to present any positive appearance at all . " A particularly happy example of how Europe will make possible " composition as positive beauty " occurs in part six of The Ambassadors . The puritan Strether , duly forewarned against the European temptress , calls on Mme. de Vionnet only to find himself charmed by her against the background of the old house in the Rue de Bellechasse . The " spell of transmission " is in full force . Strether warms to the lady under the spell of what is really a picture . As in an Italian Renaissance painting where the landscape positively hovers over the sitter , her house becomes the vibration of Mme. de Vionnet herself . The house , the court " large and open , full of revelations , for our friend , of the habit of privacy , the peace of intervals , " " the immemorial polish of the wide waxed staircase " ? these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause Strether " at the very outset to see her in the midst  | of possessions not vulgarly numerous , but hereditary , cherished , charming . " ( The anxious good taste of this in a novelist who adored Balzac would have amused Balzac , who loved to emphasize possessions vulgarly numerous . ) Strether has his first " revelation " because of this delicately beautiful woman . Mme. de Vionnet and her house are so beautifully fused that Strether is soon released from his suspicions . What wins us , too , is the typical Jamesian idyll of Europe as feminine , passive , unmoving , a picture : By a turn of the hand she had somehow made their encounter a relation . And the relation profited by a mass of things that were not , strictly , in it or of it ; by the very air in which they sat , by the high , cold , delicate room , by the world outside and the little plash in the court , by the first Empire and the relics in the stiff cabinets , by matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the unbroken clasp of her hands in her lap and the look her expression had of being most natural when her eyes were most fixed . Mme. de Vionnet will be sacrificed by her lover , Chad Newsome . As early as The American ( 1877 ) Claire de Cintre was finished off for life by her feudal family . James returning to The American for the New York edition was surprised to see how " romantic " it was , how arbitrary and unsupported he had made the tragedy of his American hero and French heroine . " Europe " as setting had been enough to supply him with motivation . By contrast , James 's American heroines , though they could be as high-mindedly duped as Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady , as sweetly victimized as Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove , as patiently long-suffering as Maggie Verver in The Golden Bowl , all showed an edge , an American strength , because they prevailed " morally . " The American girl , his " princess , " the " heiress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in James 's fiction than his pale , indecisive males . She makes her triumphant and still most memorable entry striding into The Portrait of a Lady as bouncy American independence in all things ? a Katharine Hepburn in her prime . Nothing so illustrates the roles of America and Europe in James 's mind as the contrast between Isabel 's health , her innocent self-assurance , and the Europeanized Americans around her . Withered Mr. Touchett , sickly Ralph Touchett , corrupted Madame Merle , and daemonically selfish Gilbert Osmond , all enlivened by her , virtually seduce her by their subtlety and their conscious charm . It was to be caught up like this that Isabel waited through dark lonely days in Albany . Although her attachment to her American-born " Europeans " almost destroys her , Isabel conveys all the " spell " of Americans entering upon Europe that was James 's own .  | Isabel embodies the note of " relation " that made society real . Women ? certainly James 's women ? do not stand outside society . What James would have made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . He would not have isolated her as a psychological case , in effect dropped her as everyone else did ; he was a novelist . But of course Isabel , who shares with Marian Adams the famous spiritedness of the upper-class " American girl , " really had spirit , and this was her eventual triumph . Marian went under . Daisy Miller was no more than a type for a magazine story , " the innocently adventuring , unconsciously periculant American maiden , " as Howells put it. * " Never was any civilization offered a more precious tribute than that which a great artist paid ours in the character of Daisy Miller . ... But the American woman would have none of Daisy Miller . . . because she was too jealous of her own perfection to allow that innocence might be reckless . " Was this idealization sincere , or was it just flattery of the " Iron Madonna " by the man who once said that " the man of letters must make up his mind that in the United States the fate of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In James 's " Pandora , " another early study of an American . girl who is startlingly direct and uncomplicated , a married woman modelled on Marian Adams the Washington hostess reflects : " The type 's new and the case under consideration . We have n't had time yet for complete consideration " To " consider " other people is the morality of manners ; to keep someone unrelentingly under consideration is the chief occupation of James 's characters ; finally to reflect and " consider , " endlessly , is what the moral life comes to . Isabel 's rashness in marrying Gilbert ( precisely because his considerateness seems to ask nothing for himself ) is the one act in the book ? an act that requires her to spend the rest of her time considering its folly . So the whole book asks us to join in consideration of Isabel 's case . Reflectiveness becomes the norm in this world . But the betrayal it considers , terrible enough in view of the aching good faith with which Isabel entered upon it , is enlarged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unrelieved consideration of Isabel 's plight . The concentration is wonderful , giving us point by point knowledge of the heroine as well as sympathy for her . We do not know so much of the poor , ill , palely loitering Milly Theale in The Wings of the Dove . We would not want to know this much of the relatively unsympathetic Maggie Verver footnote *Even in the rough commercial Chicago that Dreiser described in Sister Carrie ( 1900 ) a " Daisy Miller " was a term of reproach for a girl too forward for her own good .  | in 7be Golden Bowl ; Maggie is altogether too practical and too spoiled , her father 's little princess even before she gets herself a real " prince . " Isabel 's plight engages us because she is not ambiguous like Maggie and is no wraith like Milly . She is altogether healthy in life , alone only because of her natural independence and honesty . There are no secrets to her ? and this in a world where those who betray her have nothing to them but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but exposes her to evil by making her rich , is too sickly , and therefore complicated . The Jamesian male , usually a wallflower , gets Isabel 's compassion but not ours . Isabel , launched on her perilous European career by millionaire Americans , open to exploitation by corrupt Americans , is led and misled every inch of the way by considerations that depend on European beauty , European ritual . The great lawn at Gardencourt dazzles her ; Lord Warburton courts her by walking her past his family portraits ; though the English nobleman attracts her , the false Gilbert Osmond wins her by seeming to speak for the esthetic soul of Europe itself ? all consideration of the right art , the right values , the right setting . Isabel is the fairy-tale princess in the dark wood , out of her depth ; but this being Europe , it is the sacred wood . Rich , picturesquely rich , tradition-rich Europe shines like a portrait indeed as the reflection of all the worshipful glances directed at it . And Gilbert thinks he represents it better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . " After Isabel 's honest American soul , Europe is virtually the main feature of the novel . Isabel is vaguely unsettled by the sight of Madame Merle standing while Gilbert is all too comfortably seated . She has no reason to suspect that they are anything but " friends . " Between friends , this would have been a breach of manners in Boston . In Boston the sight would not have weighed so heavily on our heroine 's mind . The intrigue , the unsuspected intimacy that the scene imparts , helps to build up the increasing suspicion that the surface of " consideration " ( a term Gilbert applies equally to social standards and esthetic matters ) is false . We sense in this world something contrived and wrong , not just narrow and snobbish . We are beset by the dominating image of a " portrait , " both as virtu and as the deception inherent in social appearance . Wickedness in James is duplicity , usually sexual . An eye is always at the peephole , and being nothing but an eye , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Ambassadors that Chad and Mme. de Vionnet , who are always in each other 's company , are in fact lovers . Maggie Verver will get the point about her prince and Charlotte Stant as a kind of triumphal crisis , the richest experience yet of her already distinguished life . Milly Theale , for all her pressing mortality , seems to have understood about Merton i ) ensher and Kate Croy , and in death she exerts this knowledge around  | them as the supreme act of her life . ' I'he " criminal , " and James uses the word , is a conspirator . There was nothing in James 's world to conspire about but the secret love to which money is attached . The bystanders , the onlookers , are mainly virtuous ; action and sin are synonymous . James 's central fixation on the " ruminant , " the observer in all things ( like Strether in The Ambassadors , he will want nothing for himself ) , helps to explain why coupling is arranged in bad faith and is vaguely dirty . Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Merton Densher get Milly Theale to love Densher ; Charlotte Stant , Prince Amerigo 's mistress , gets Maggie Verver married to the prince . What moral inflexibility it took on the part of Henry James to overlook the cynical mores of English country weekends in favor of standards acceptable to ? Henry James . What genius it took on his part to carry this off , to make it all acceptable now as well as then . So Milly Theale 's legacy to her would-be betrayers shames them into not being able to add it to any satisfactory life together . So Maggie wins back her husband by her " character . " Naturally , this makes possible endless interpretation of Maggie 's " real " character , though James would seem to have had no doubt ? in his more innocent time ? that she was a real American girl ( and the daughter of a billionaire ) and able to get her husband back if she wanted to . James 's unredeemed characters , like Gilbert Osmond , are villains through inflexibility . They are addicts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osmond is one of his great creations because Gilbert ( who forces Madame Merle to do the same ) never stops thinking and planning . By nature they are spies . Not only does Madame Merle get Isabel married to Osmond as stealthily as she conceals her past relations with Osmond ; we also feel , as the book begins to heat up after the long , languorous opening , that Madame Merle and Osmond are never thinking of anything but Isabel . It is true that everyone in the book has an eye on Isabel and that this steady focus draws us into James 's own fascination with her . Lord Warburton , whom she rejected , seriously considers marrying Gilbert 's infantile daughter ? so that he can remain in the company of Isabel ? The dying Ralph Touchett comes to Rome so that he can hover over her . Caspar Goodwood seems to have nothing to do but to run over periodically to Europe to persuade a married woman that she is beauty in distress . Henrietta Stackpole functions only as the comic maid in attendance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel . They seem to have no interest in life apart from her . Madame Merle claims to be forever dashing about Europe , but she has not been travelling at all ; she has been watching at the keyhole , waiting to get at poor Isabel again . All this watching  | and waiting works on us because we recognize a compulsion . Isabel 's marriage to Osmond has become a conspiracy against her . Even the staple of Victorian melodrama ? Madame Merle 's inability to declare herself to her own daughter ( who dislikes her anyway ) ? becomes intrinsic to Madame Merle 's stealthy nature . James 's scene-drama succeeds because he , too , is unrelenting in his attention . Everything must point , point all the time . James bears down hard on a scene . We feel his excitement . The book leads us from scene to scene as if it were a play . James never discovered how characters should talk in a play , for his dialogues are founded on mistrustful people who are always picking each other up on words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclosure of the evil in those closest to us . The nearness of Osmond to Isabel is stifling , while she is surrounded by great English country houses , Tuscan villas , Roman streets . In the great dark palazzo this girl , so surrounded by things , will sit alone by the fire , recognizing at last that she has been violated to the very soul . The moral crisis Isabel comes to in chapter 42 is James 's classical moment , his tie with the virtuous tradition he left in America . Isabel recognizes that " the first gentleman of Europe , " as he believes himself to be , the man with inhumanly perfect taste , is outraged by her freedom of mind and is trying to destroy it . Since the Portrait in its beauty of surface and scene , its investiture of old Europe as civilization , is in great part a " consecration " of the esthetic ideal , James 's association of spiritual wickedness with a total esthete shows how " native " his sense of good and evil remained . The sharpest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert illustrates James 's ability to " do " Americans who have been set free in Europe to think of nothing but their good taste . Only minor , comic characters like Henrietta Stackpole have jobs ( and James had a particular aversion to the woman writer as journalist ) . Business hardly comes into his world ; the Newsome family in The Ambassadors manufacture " an object of domestic utility , " no doubt because James could not think of an actual object . In The Golden Bowl the superrich Adam Verver from " American City " is entirely free to saunter about his great English estate , " Fawns , " reviewing his relation to his daughter . But how many fine consciences there are , how many quivering sensibilities , how many people anxious only to keep each other under review ! James 's world is truly imagined ? a world in which people keep imagining each other , in which ( usually ) every possible allowance is made for the merely sensitive , in which the merely sensitive have come to think of themselves as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when he has broken her heart , " you who were so fine ! "  | James adored the " educated class " but did not idealize it . The connoisseur , the dilettante , the well-bred rnan who seemed to have been bred to no purpose but the savoring of his own distinction , could be the end product of so much leisure and civilization . Gilbert Osmond as the epitome of this type provoked all his horror of the evil hiding in the house of art . That prodigal artist Henry James could not have been more scornful of the type ? especially where it represented the passive side of so much " civilization " and hence something of himself . Osmond is one of James 's finest creations . This decadent and shallowhearted man lives only for what he is pleased to call culture , has equated society entirely with culture , yet wants the world to notice his every effect . James in a passionate aside notes that no man is more the slave of conventional opinion . Osmond 's cultivated powerlessness makes him conformist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society makes him destructive in his relations with other people . Osmond carries out to its final logic , by trying to destroy all independence in his wife , that weakness of being a mere spectator that James illustrated in the character of Ralph Touchett , who protects himself against women by being constantly ill . The elder Touchett 's own early withdrawal from love may be responsible for the eccentricity of his wife . James knew enough of fastidious withdrawal and anxious self-protection to see an alter ego in a type which even in its generosity does harm , as Ralph Touchett does by making Isabel rich . Gilbert is the ultimate refinement beyond which James did not care to go . Ralph Touchett , dangling from the tree of his father 's millions like a withered apple about to fall , can fulfill himself only in misguided fantasy . Wanting to make Isabel " rich , " he gets his father to leave her three hundred fifty thousand pounds . People who meet the requirements of their imagination can be called rich . This double use of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how riches are acquired . But Gilbert is not so removed . His haughty estheticism , his obsessive fastidiousness in all things , are soon turned against his wife , whom he hates for her independence , as he hates everything and everyone he can not control . In this gallery hung with so many gleaming surfaces and fine portraits , Gilbert is the dilettante who would kill . He betrays the society of fine surfaces by showing the black heart beneath . Everything that prides itself on " taste " as a social task , on the epicurean and the epicene , is incarnated in  | Gilbert Osnond 's lethal conformism ? what surprises and shocks his wife most about him . Despite so much adoration of the fine surface , Gilbert wants just to know what the powerful think . The real threat to the soul ? to Isabel 's , for Gilbert is past saving ? arises from an excessive worship of the fine surface . Yet in The Golden Bowl , the greatest , richest novel of his triumphant last period , in the twentieth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces , civilization in excelsis , that inspired him to transcend himself as the great novelist of manners . He positively shone in the reflection of the " great world " given him by imperial England , the second Roman Empire ? and with a Roman " prince " at the center of the action ! The Wings of the Dove depends for its dominant image of " mortal " beauty on the figure of a dying girl , the intended dupe of a plot to acquire her fortune conceived by the man she loves and his mistress . Milly Theale 's thoughts and actions are not seen directly ; her effect on others , especially after her death , makes the book . So her pale , merely outlined self needs the contrast with resplendent , moneyed London , with the hard-pressed Kate Croy and her " devouring " Aunt Maud ? with the Swiss mountaintop on which we see the dying Milly ironically perched as the " heiress of all the ages , " with Lord Mark dreaming of fortune in the Piazza San Marco , " the drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-denying figure of Lambert Strether becomes vivid against the Paris setting , the " Babylon , bright and hard . " Lunching along the Seine with the supposed femme fatale , Mme. de Vionnet , whom he has come to Europe to separate from the son of his patroness , he can not tell the perfection of the lady from the perfection of the moment . The most famous scene in The Ambassadors has Strether , the yearning , life-impoverished puritan in the garden of the great sculptor Gloriani , crying out that he has never " lived . " The Ambassadors ends on Strether 's denying himself the love offered by Maria Gostrey ; The Wings of the Dove , on Milly 's power after death to " elevate " those who planned to use her in the most shameless way . All this privation and nobility impresses us less than the power that Europe had to make people shine . In The Golden Bowl , the last novel James completed , all his dreams of the great world , the favorite landscape of his imagination , were fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly matched to James 's enduring love of Europe itself . Nowhere else in James are such greedy and crooked people so constantly ennobled in conversation with people who are distrustful and distrusted but regularly come out with " You 're wonderful " ? because of a social status that on all sides compels respect , especially from 1 lenry James . Even William James ,  | disliking " the method of narration by interminable elaboration of suggestive reference ( I do n't know what to call it , but you know what I mean ) , " admitted that " in spite of it all , there is a brilliancy and cleanness of effect , and in this book especially a high-toned social atmosphere that are unique and extraordinary . " Only James would have thought up an impoverished Roman " prince " who is always ceremoniously referred to as " the Prince . " He enters the book , on the eve of his marriage to the daughter of an American billionaire , in an understandably somber mood ; even a prince in need of a fortune , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have some conflict within himself about laying his head on the marriage block . He could not afford to marry his real love , Charlotte Stant ; she could not afford to marry him . So she returns from a hurried , distasteful sojourn in her native America to help celebrate the marriage of her lover to her dearest friend , Maggie Verver . The duplicity , the many second thoughts felt like the famous flaw in the flawed and gilded crystal bowl that Maggie eventually buys herself as a wedding present , do not keep the prince from enjoying both Charlotte and his wife 's money . Status in The Golden Bowl is everything , it resolves with magic force an existence that consists entirely of the most measured affections and reflections . Adam Verver , the American billionaire whose only tie to his origins and presumable enterprise in " American City " is the planned donation of a museum , spends all his time on his English estate looking after his daughter ? when he is not depositing art as if it were bullion . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their marriage , " that father puts away ? the bigger and more cumbrous , of course , which he stores , has already stored in masses , here and in Paris , in Italy , in Spain , in warehouses , vaults , banks , safes , wonderful secret places . . . . But there 's nothing , however tiny , that we 've missed . " Still , Adam is so far removed from the usual earthiness of the American superrich that " it was all , at bottom , in him , the aesthetic principle , planted where it could burn with a cold , still flame ; where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved , on the idea ( followed by appropriation ) of plastic beauty , of the thing visibly perfect in its kind . " " The surfaces ring . " Of course this world is " flawed " by adultery , secret and dishonest because of sex . Sex has nothing to do with the way Adam Verver , that good man if all-too-loving father , made his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled only by the trouble that women get him into . ) It would be sentimental to suppose that James 's  | great fairy tale turns not on his adoration of these highly placed and privileged characters but on the moral imperative ( or a natural sense of possession ) that leads Maggie to reclaim her prince and her father to take his wife , Charlotte , in self-sacrificing exile back to their native land . Nowhere else does one feel that James has at last met up with the ideal personages of his English dream world . James was right to call The Golden Bowl the best and richest of his novels . Nowhere else does he seem so totally at ease in the happy spilling over of his images for mental states ; nowhere else does he so obviously luxuriate in the duration of his characters ' endless fascination with their own status and with each other . James 's great achievement in this last novel was to make " personality " triumph over the accumulation of experience . With this he demonstrated a distinctness of and fascination for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a clinical psychology replaced every traditional sense of uniqueness . For James the individual soul is still the product of the most finespun relationships , can be put into motion only by a civilization that values persons in the most delicate assortments and combinations . Adultery , though " criminal , " was fundamental to James 's novelistic sense of drama . The Golden Bowl really has only four characters spinning each other out over almost eight hundred pages . Without the total involvement of each member of the quadrille with all the others , there would be no joy to the book at all . Given the involvement in all its suspense , we get such a feast of implications and recognitions as James most wanted to write ? and finally achieved . What if all this was not " civilization " as the wisest Europeans knew it ? What if it was so perfectly composed , every nuance linked , that the very perfection declared its necessary fragility ? James would not have tolerated the objection , much less have understood it . This was his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new century ? not Proust , not Kafka , not Joyce ? would in his country have been so secure as Henry James was when he completed The Golden Bowl . He exultantly told Scribner 's that it was " the most done of my productions . . . a shaft sunk to the real basis of the subject ? a real feat of engineering . " It was his supreme moment . The terror of August 1914 was still inconceivable . His own proficiency in technique , in the logic of art , in nuance , he felt to be tribute to the civilization that had made him less of an exile . He even felt the book to be an accomplishment of that civilization . It was " rich " in every suggestion , able to meet the requirements of Henry James 's imagination . And it was secure , a book like an imperium of sorts , and one that would  | surely last . One of the high moments of The Golden Bowl is a ball at which royalty makes an appearance . There is even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ball , are borne up by a passion greater than their passion for each other . It was James 's finest hour . There are societies , he gravely tells us in The Golden Bowl , " subject to the greatest personages possible . "  | Chicago and the East " : Dreiser , Adams , Mark Twain Sometimes I see myself as a hoop in an arc reaching over from one phase of existence to another . THEODORE DREiSER One day in 1889 , eighteen-year-old Caroline Meeber from Columbia City , Wisconsin ? " Sister Carrie as she was half affectionately termed by her family " ? boarded a train for Chicago that was to take her ( and the surprisingly but never dependably gifted newspaper reporter from Terre Haute who had imagined her for his first novel ) into world literature . The twenty-eight year-old Theodore Dreiser , who had been raised in an immigrant German Catholic home and was largely self-educated , having hungrily absorbed in public libraries harsh doctrine from Balzac and Herbert Spencer , was never to forget his first glimpse of Chicago in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the raw and muddy city was an " Aladdin 's view " from The Arabian Nights . " Had I one gift to offer the world , it would be the delight of sensing the world as I then saw it . " The Aladdin 's lamp became the " giant magnet " in Sister Carrie . Chicago 's population on the eve of the 189os was not so much thriving upon established commerce as upon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others . The sound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structures was everywhere heard . Great industries were moving in . The huge railroad corporations which had long before recognized the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for transfer and shipping purposes . Streetcar lines had been extended far out into the open country in anticipation of rapid growth . The city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewers through regions where , perhaps , one solitary  | house stood out alone ? a pioneer of the populous ways to be . " There were regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet lighted throughout the night with long , blinking lines of gas-lamps , fluttering in the wind . Narrow board walks extended out , passing here a house , and there a store , at far intervals , eventually ending on the open prairie . Carrie was eighteen in 1889 because Dreiser , born in the year of the Great Fire , was then eighteen . The Chicago that Carrie first saw was the Chicago rebuilt as steel after the 1871 fire had almost completely wiped out the old wooden ramshackle Chicago . Still clinging to the lake , and backed up by the empty prairie , the city with its eye on the future was by 1893 to transcend itself . Suddenly a center and showplace of American " energies , " as Henry Adams was surprised to note , it grabbed for itself the World 's Columbian Exposition in honor of the four hundredth anniversary of Columbus 's unintended discovery . No one who was there ever forgot what was to become the most celebrated fair and exposition in American history . It marked the symbolic end of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It saw the greatest outpouring of crowds since the Civil War , proudly exhibited American industrial processes and the latest technology at a time when the United States was eclipsing Great Britain , and inspired a brash new style in mass entertainment , the era of Coney Island amusement parks . Whitman , who had died the year before , would have gloried in what he called democratic " ensemble " ? the urban mass he called the counterpart of Leaves of Grass . " Theo " Dreiser had special reason to remember the fair . He met his future wife , Sara Osborne White ( familiarly known as Jug ) , in the summer of 1893 when the twenty-one-year-old star reporter on the St. Louis Republic " shepherded " to the fair a group of Missouri schoolteachers who had won a contest sponsored by the newspaper . Dreiser , with just one year at the University of Indiana paid for by a high school teacher , was self-conscious about his lack of a degree and of middle-class refinement . German had been spoken in Dreiser 's home , even by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . The fact that Jug the schoolteacher had a firmer hold on grammar than Dreiser did had helped to make her desirable . In the course of a madly erotic life he often managed to combine a love affair with editorial help . At his urging after their marriage , Jug went through the manuscript of Sister Carrie and made many genteel revisions . Dreiser was anxious to tone down the sexual matter that was central to the book , in the belief that this would make the book more acceptable to a publisher . It did  | not . Dreiser never suffered long from objections to his style ; he unconsciously relied on narrative force to carry him through . The firmness of Jug 's character , once a welcome contrast to his " dissolute " sisters ( models for Carrie and Jennie Gerhardt ) , was eventually to prove too much for the moody Dreiser , who could never remain interested for very long in any one woman ? and who liked from time to time to torment himself about this failing . Chicago in the nineties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , was Dreiser 's destined subject , as it was for other Midwestern writers . He did not choose it , as Henry James chose so many things to write about . Chicago seemed to choose him ? which was what Dreiser felt about every circumstance in his life , every plot in his fiction . He was the first American novelist to invest the big city with such a hungry , avid sense of power . No one after him has yet rendered the physical discovery of a city in such haunting detail , with so much feeling brought up from the depths of the old small-town experience . As a foreigner of sorts , the first major American writer who was not a Protestant , and a " barbarian " by accepted standards , he could not help challenging the pieties of a society unable to anticipate their loss . Dreiser 's images of the city have a lasting hold because he described the most familiar objects in a great city as if they were foreign to him . The pathos of distance became his fictional perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every appearance of the modern city became single , hallucinatory , painfully distinct with that first impression of a new world . Carrie comes to Chicago to live with her sister , finds herself unwelcome , and walks about , looking for work . The frightened but impressionable eighteen-year-old girl from Columbia City matched the newness of Chicago . Dreiser identified the stupor and loneliness in Carrie 's heart with the unfinished landscape and the brutal unconcern surrounding it . The force with which Chicago had been built up from the prairie fascinated its own intellectuals . In With the Procession , a satire by Chicago 's " patrician " Henry Blake Fuller , a character pointing to the " new " Chicago says that the town labors under one disadvantage : it is the only great city in the world to which all its citizens have come for the one common , avowed object of making money . There you have its genesis , its growth , its end and object . . . . In this Garden City of ours every man cultivates his own little bed and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Chicago was halfway between the wilderness and the stock exchange . Every human aggression was closer to the writer 's eye . Chicago was a  | concentrated force accessible enough to become a favorite subject of social criticism on the part of early realists like Fuller and Robert I lerrick , transplanted Harvard poets and scholars at the new University of Chicago like William Vaughn Moody and Robert Morss Lovett , tough-talking " literary " reporters from Carl Sandburg to Ben Hecht . Much of Thorstein Veblen 's The Theory of the Leisure Class ( 1899 ) , with key terms for the appetites of the new-rich like " conspicuous consumption , " was documented from Chicago . The new science of sociology , often based on the immigrants ' settling into their separate ethnic wards , found brilliant exponents at the university founded on Rockefeller money . The sardonic criticism of American wealth and its manners that was to fill early-twentieth-century fiction also found its grim material in the Haymarket affair , the stockyards , the meat-processing jungle , the terrible winters and sometimes even more terrible police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) have offered to buy the Great Wall of China . The obvious thing about Chicago was that it was forever making itself , as it was remaking the Polish and Slavic immigrants and the children of farms and small towns who streamed into it . As a subject , it was easier to get hold of than New York , was present all compact to a writer 's eye ; the transformation from the old provincial life to the magnificent views from Lake Shore Drive was the work of one short , violent period in history . Chicago incarnated the big change that so many young people were making in their lives . And Dreiser , in the literalness of his fascination with the city , the obsession with fact that he developed as a skilled reporter and effective writer of " tragedy and heartbreak " stories for the Sunday supplements , identified totally with the " lure " of the city . In the original version of Sister Carrie Dreiser reproduced the names of Chicago saloons , restaurants , business establishments . He carefully listed " Chicago windows " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . then rapidly coming into use . " He did not have to invent anything that Carrie saw when she first made the rounds of Chicago looking for work , or the " gorgeous " and " truly swell " saloon where Hurstwood was manager . Not the overhead curved marble oscillating fans above the bar , the ceramic tile floor , and the top-hatted ward heelers , actors , merchants , politicians , " the general run of successful characters about town , a goodly company of rotund , rosy figures , silk-hatted , starchy-bosomed , be-ringed and be-scarf pinned to the queen 's taste . " Not Hurstwood himself , who enters Sister Carrie " dressed in excellent , tailored suits of imported goods , several rings upon his fingers , a fine blue diamond in his necktie , a striking vest of some new pattern and a watch  | chain of solid gold which held a charm of rich design and a watch of the latest make and engraving . " The twenty-eight-year-old Dreiser began his first novel in the fall of 1899 by suddenly writing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had never thought of writing a novel until pressed to try his hand by Arthur Henry , his managing editor on the Toledo Blade and his most intimate friend . Henry was a glibly conventional writer of fiction , but he gave an appearance of flair , which Dreiser certainly lacked . He was an " emancipated " husband and assertive thinker in the ironic style favored by such end-of-the-century newspapermen as Stephen Crane ? their representative man and attested genius . Like Dreiser 's future friend and pugnacious supporter , H. L. Mencken , Henry provided a figure of authority to Dreiser , who was to demonstrate awesome force as a social novelist but little personal self-confidence . Dreiser had been scarred by the poverty and shiftlessness of his large family , the rigidity of his German Catholic father , his Mennonite mother 's seeming helplessness , and his own lack of formal education . To the end of his life , when he managed to die a member of the Communist Party and a communicant of one church after another , he was easily lulled by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the composition , editing , and publishing of Sister Carrie in 1900 , made himself important to Dreiser . He prodded " his " reporter to write his first short stories when Dreiser wanted to write plays ; he cut a good many sentences and paragraphs out of the manuscript of Sister Carrie , largely on the ground that Dreiser 's philosophizing over the fate of his characters was not necessary to the remorseless tread of the novel . He pushed Dreiser to hold Doubleday , Page and Company to its agreement when Frank Doubleday , shocked by Carrie 's failure to suffer appropriately after living with two men ( he was also prodded by Mrs. Doubleday 's displeasure ) , tried to get out of publishing the novel . Henry may also have been a model to the Dreiser who , after marrying the pretty redheaded schoolteacher he had fallen in love with at the fair , became as restless as Drouet and Hurstwood in Sister Carrie . Henry had with great aplomb left his wife for Anna T. Mallon , who was also to have an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typing agency and had  | the manuscript typed up by a succession of her " girls " as a favor to l ) reiser ; they also found things to correct in the always " correctable " l ) reiser . " My mind was a blank except for the name . I had no idea who or what she was to be . . . . There was something mystic about it , as if I were being used , like a medium . " When Dreiser , " as if in a trance , " began his novel , he was thinking of his sister Emma , who had run off to New York with a married man , L. A. Hopkins , a cashier in Chapin and Gore 's tavern in Chicago . Hopkins had panicked when his wife learned of his affair with Emma and had absconded with thirty-five hundred dollars . This rash act provided the basis for the central scene in Sister Carrie ( duplicated for the power of " accident " only by the boating " accident " in An American Tragedy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe quite without meaning to . In An American Tragedy Clyde Griffiths , who wants to be rid of his pregnant mistress , Roberta Alden , watches her drown without technically killing her . In both novels ? and this is Dreiser 's lasting achievement ? " accidental " crime forcibly illustrates Dreiser 's belief that we do what a " voice " within us tells us to do . That voice is the criminal , thief , and murderer in us that everything in our laborious upbringing and officially moral civilization tries to suppress . The true source and inspiration of our actions is always unexpected . Civilization is an ordeal . Inwardly , we are always in flight . Hurstwood is unable to put the money back in the locked safe and , suddenly released by the fact that he can not put it back , persuades Carrie to run off with him , first to Montreal , where they have a mock wedding ceremony , then to New York . In New York Hurstwood soon goes through what money he has left after returning most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business he falls apart . Carrie leaves him and becomes a successful actress . Hurstwood gasses himself in a flophouse . Hurstwood is the active center of the novel , not Carrie . The most celebrated feature of the novel is Hurstwood 's collapse in New York ; he changes rapidly and shockingly from a smoothly self-assured saloon manager into a derelict . When William Heinemann published Sister Carrie in England , he thought the novel so much Hurstwood 's story that he had the opening two hundred pages , before Hurstwood appears , cut to eighty-four . Dreiser was right , of course , to keep the original title when Frank Doubleday , reluctantly publishing the novel in 1900 , wanted to call it The Flesh and the Spirit . Dreiser not only saw Carrie as a catalyst of Hurstwood 's startling collapse ; he saw her , in all her early timidity and lasting silence , as the deepest possible force , the role he naturally assigned to women . To the always alienated and radical Dreiser , Carrie represents the power of transformation , the woman as cata- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? in this respect she was truly his " sister " ? as a wondering , brooding center of perception . If Carrie is the precipitant , Hurstwood is the stage on which Dreiser 's first American tragedy is unrolled . The tragedy is that Americans may have nothing to live for but the " bitch-goddess . " Dreiser , far outside the area of James 's moral concern , knew that for such a man as Hurstwood , success included the acquisition of Carrie at any risk . So much sexual greed , shocking as it may have been to those who would not admit lust as a counterpart of the general acquisitiveness , was inherent in Dreiser himself . It gave force to his novel . His own furious sexuality he interpreted as a protest against American hypocrisy in all things . In the unforeseen creation of Hurstwood ( he bore no resemblance to the forgettable embezzler with whom sister Emma had run off ? they had ended up in New York placidly renting out rooms for " immoral purposes " ) Dreiser revealed the deepest traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of Hurstwood 's failure of nerve . After Sister Carrie was killed by its own publisher , Dreiser actually went through a nervous collapse amazingly like Hurstwood 's and was himself on the point of suicide when he was rescued by his brother Paul , the successful songwriter and man of the theater with whom " Theo " had written " On the Banks of the Wabash . " Dreiser was no sooner recovered than he began to write fawning portraits of business leaders for a magazine called Success . As editor of Butterick 's , he carefully kept out of that ladies ' magazine examples of the new realistic fiction . But Dreiser identified with Hurstwood 's pursuit of woman and of the " bitch-goddess , " and he knew all too well the panic that is always the underside of that pursuit . He incarnated in Carrie the unconscious force of sex that Henry James never allowed his heroines , who were triumphantly moral in life ( Isabel Archer , Maggie Verver ) or in death ( Milly Theale ) . Henry Adams , in the famous meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself whether he knew of any American artist who had ever insisted on the power of sex , " could come up only with Whitman . Adams certainly liked to see woman as goddess . He would have resisted the " lure " of Carrie even if the book had come to his attention . She was lower-class and too much trouble . Carrie and Hurstwood were both aspects of Dreiser himself . They represented the underside of American life , which was all too familiar to him . When he was eleven , the distressed Dreiser family made a new home in Evansville , Indiana , thanks to Annie Brace , the madame of a local brothel who was his brother Paul 's mistress . His " Carrie " sister ran off with an embezzler ; his " Jennie Gerhardt " sister , as the novel relates , became the  | mistress of a politician . Dreiser as a young laundry-wagon driver in Chicago kept back some of the collections from his employer . To the end of his life he never lost a sense of his own insignificance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his sense of force , desperately as he tried to locate this in the conventional determinism of his generation , that gave him his startling grasp of human drift and accident in all things . Only Dreiser would have been stopped in the writing of the most powerful scene in Sister Carrie , Hurstwood 's deterioriation , because " Somehow , I felt unworthy to write all that . It seemed too big , too baffling . " The artist in Dreiser was always stronger than the man . Few writers with Dreiser 's power had such crude verbal habits , such rudimentary instincts about life . A writer brought up with the " proper " English of a middle-class family in the Midwest would not have introduced Carrie as possessing " four dollars in money . " We learn at the outset that " she could scarcely toss her head gracefully , " just as we are told on meeting Hurstwood that " Fitzgerald and Moy 's Adams Street place " was " really a gorgeous saloon from a Chicago standpoint . . . . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social fact led him to report that Hurstwood spent all of one dollar and fifty cents for dinner , that Carrie at the shoe factory earned three dollars and fifty cents a week , and that for her first day at work she " dressed herself in a worn shirt-waist of dotted blue percale , a skirt of light brown serge rather faded , and a small straw hat which she had worn all summer at Columbia City . " At the shoe factory " the whole atmosphere was one of hard contract . " Dreiser occasionally interrupted his own story to sigh and " philosophize " over the irreversible actions of his characters ; he was swept up by the process he was recounting , item by item , with such hard logic . Despite these clumsy interventions , no other " reportorial realist " could have led his heroine so convincingly into Carrie 's crisis. * She becomes ill and loses her job before Drouet takes her over . Her numbness , shyness , and outward submissiveness are powerfully contrasted with the compulsions of the market system and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less to resist , the " forces " that surround this " waif , " and virtually forced out of her sister 's dreary flat when she loses her job , Carrie allows herself to be bought by Drouet , the flashy drummer whom she had met on the train that first brought her to Chicago . We see how right Dreiser was to warn us , at the opening of Carrie 's journey to the big city , footnote ' Reportorial realist " was the phrase used by the reader for Harper and Brothers who turned down Sister Carrie . " I can not conceive of the book arousing the interest or inviting the attention , after the opening chapters , of the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels . "  | that " self-interest with her was high , but not strong . It was , nevertheless , her guiding characteristic . " In the chapters following Carrie 's fall from virtue , we see that while there is nothing heroic about her , her submission is also natural to the highly limited person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how shallow Drouet is , but her own automatism is not really clear to her . Carrie ? this is Dreiser 's " modern " insight ? is a construction of society . Her assets are a certain prettiness and a " dawning " sensibility rather than a trained intelligence ? a sensibility in which Dreiser portrayed his own conscious makeup . Carrie 's success ( not Hurstwood 's collapse ) makes her increasingly " ponder " her life and , near the end of the book , " dream such happiness as you may never feel . " She will never lose her essential passivity , her " wondering , " the unconscious cruelty of being able to captivate Drouet , to infatuate and ruin Hurstwood , without herself coming to any realization about them . In some cardinal meaning of the word , Carrie is innocent ? in the sense that she is lacking . Naively wrapped up in her own life , she is unable to imagine another 's . This may be the fate of " modern " people whose personalities are constructed for them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were to be more and more people with nothing of their own but a desire for " happiness . " This , as much as the selfishness sanctioned by the market system , Dreiser may have had in mind when he said that the whole atmosphere of Carrie 's first factory was one of hard contract . We finally see Carrie in her famous rocking chair ; she broods and broods over the mystery of it all without seeing anything more clearly than she did on the day she set out for Chicago . How did a character so passive and composed of so much inert " wondering " come to have a strong and altogether compelling novel written around her ? Carrie is hardly a designing femme fatale , and The Flesh and the Spirit would have been an irrelevant as well as a meretricious title for a book that turns as much on Carrie 's passivity as on Hurstwood 's lust . Carrie haunts the novel that bears her name because she represents the force of sex , the challenge to the established mores , that can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are wrapped up in the daily pursuit of profit . Her original helplessness when confronted with Chicago , her sliding into a life with Drouet and I lurstwood that she hardly anticipated , the stage success she never planned or even understood , convey Dreiser 's view of the modern soul 's merging into a situation from which mind and affection remain de-  | tached . Classical tragedy was based on human limitation ? the larger struggle with the universe was always in view . Modern tragedy is unreflectiveness , apartness in our hearts from the lives we actually live and drive others to live . The first chapter title in Sister Carrie is " The Magnet Attracting : A Waif Amid Forces . " This " waif " will never really know what is happening to her . Her sexuality is as incomprehensible to Carrie , as fatal to Hurstwood , as nature was to primitive man . This sexuality accomplishes a revolution in people 's lives , however , and in 1900 it was recognized as a threat to the established order . Dreiser did not altogether see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ways " disturbed the secularized Protestant elect who had replaced religion with morality and morality with propriety . Unlike Whitman , he attempted to construct no new world of the spirit , no personal world . Always feeling himself rejectable , he did not understand the challenge he represented . What he did understand was that Carrie and Hurstwood are caught up in a situation beyond their power of reflection ( and beyond Dreiser 's ) , though he would struggle all his life with " science " and Spencer 's " The Unknowable , " and with his ultimate wistfulness would confess , " Sometimes I see myself as a hoop in an arc reaching over from one phase of existence to another . " From which it followed that what a writer had to do was not only to narrate the sequence of force , to develop the inevitability of the plot , but also ? as the Greek chorus did in the face of the destiny inflicted on human beings ? to cry out in fragmented and sometimes helpless speech . All his life Dreiser was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been aware of how unconventional a first novel he had written , for to assure its publication some thirty-six thousand words were cut out of the manuscript by Arthur Henry , Dreiser 's wife , and Dreiser himself . The original manuscript is more explicit about the sexual illegitimacy that is so important to the book . In it Carrie struggles with herself about moving in with Drouet and about leaving Drouet for Hurstwood ( to whom she is deeply attracted ) . At the same time it is made clear that Drouet went on philandering even after he had coaxed Carrie into his bed , and that Hurstwood frequented prostitutes after he had lured Carrie to New York . The atmosphere of the original is steamier and more truthful to the characters of birds of passage like Drouet and Hurstwood . Carrie and Hurstwood make love in their Montreal hotel room before they go through the bigamous wedding ceremony . We are more aware than ever of Hurstwood 's desperate character . He hated his wife but stayed with her as long as " she loved him vigorously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not always understand  | what Dreiser was after . In eliminating Dreiser 's pointed judgment of 1lurstwood ? " 1 le saw a trifle more clearly the necessities of our social organization , but he was more unscrupulous in the matter of sinning against it " ? Henry eliminated our own need to anticipate Hurstwood 's actual subtlety . Although nothing in the original version prepares us for Hurstwood 's disintegration , we still need to know more about the hidden forces in this strange man . His real secret is his essential despair over those things he can barely hold on to . Dreiser originally ended the book with Hurstwood 's suicide , which confirms our premonition of his desperate nature . To end the book with Hurstwood 's death was more in keeping with the social logic of Sister Carrie than Carrie 's stage musings from her rocking chair ( " Oh , the tangle of human life " ) . But Hurstwood , as always , made Dreiser uneasy . Dreiser wandered off to the Palisades one day ( the book was largely written on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story with the generalized meditation that ends , " Oh , Carrie ! Carrie ! Oh , blind strivings of the human heart ! " He had begun by writing " Sister Carrie " as if in a trance ; he had to return to Carrie in the end . She duplicated the young Dreiser , who was full of feeling and , in the person of Carrie , not beyond pitying himself . He had to carry her to this rhetorical finale in order to deliver her from the conventional world . That defiance was what he cared about most ; it was the secret message of the novel . His publisher in New York , Frank Doubleday , understood this well enough when he did his best to kill the book . Mark Twain was in Chicago several times in 1893 , the summer of the fair , but was so entangled in business affairs that he never got to see it . Nor did Henry Adams 's black butler , who had come out with Adams and his friends in the private railway carriage of Senator Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook for them . Adams , benevolently inquiring what his butler thought of the fair , was surprised to hear that he had been too busy looking after the Adams party . Mark Twain , always the showman with his eye on the dollar , originally thought that it would be suitable for the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery to dig up Columbus 's bones and exhibit them in Chicago . No other writer made so much of the fair , was more impressed with the symbol of American " unity " that Chicago provided , than that constant traveller and increasingly bitter observer , 1 lenry Adams . For the opening in  | May , Adams was usually with Elizabeth Cameron , the elderly Senator Cameron 's much younger wife . No one will ever know just how intimate Adams was with her or how intimate he would have liked to be . Adams always wrote to her as though he were in love with her , and since Senator Cameron ( who was even older than Adams ) was never far away , it is probable that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Cameron 's charm and intelligence , the widower Adams was able without risk to enjoy the delight ( and mischief ) of public courtship . He managed , as usual , to make literature out of his passionate wistfulness toward Mrs. Cameron ? his letters to her are as wonderful as anything this publicly frigid man ever wrote . Adams soon left Chicago for his summer in France and the enraptured study of the medieval . Then the Panic of 1893 , which was to launch the worst depression in American history , brought Adams home to save the family investments . Henry in the 187os had documented the machinations on Wall Street of Jay Gould and Jim Fiske ; his meticulous scholarship extended to all matters of finance . He handled the Panic so well that by September , he relates in the " Chicago ( 1893 ) " chapter of the Education , " the storm having partly blown over , life had taken on a new face , and one so interesting that he set off to Chicago to study the Exposition again , and stayed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study to fill a hundred years , and his education spread over chaos . " The coolness of this , the surface air of personal intactness and detached curiosity , were in Adams 's most practiced Mandarin manner . In the Education , that masterpiece representing the " unity " of Henry Adams without a hint of the cracks , he managed to gloss over the inclusive despair and political hatred that erupted in his letters . But his letters are his autobiography ; the Education is a book about the nineteenth century ? whose transformations , making the United States a great power , Adams thought he could measure . His personal sense of powerlessness and " failure " ? the wrong people taking over ? coincided with his increasing determination to quantify the new technology , to apply science to history . He was sure that the staggering new power would eventually break down from the " entropy " that operated in all closed systems . But the more his vision of " chaos " excited him , the more he grandly assumed the air of the objective historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He liked a panoramic view in everything , for this promised " education " ; he was particularly impressed by exhibitions of the latest technology . The new American . . . was the child of steam and the brother of the dynamo , and already , within less than thirty years , this mass of mixed humanities ,  | brought together by steam , was squeezed and welded into approach to shape ; a product of so much mechanical power , and bearing no distinctive marks but that of pressure . The new American like the new European was the servant of the power-house , as the European of the twelfth century was the servant of the Church . Adams saw the new technology , as he saw everything else , as an index of change . Unable to forget how his own class had panicked with the stock market ? his brother John Quincy was in a few months to die of the strain ? he saw determinism behind every panorama . " Blindly , some very powerful energy was at work , doing something that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on exhibition at Chicago made with the faltering American economy ! With the condescension that had now become second nature to him , Adams " admitted " the exposition " to be a sort of industrial , speculative growth and product of the Beaux Arts artistically induced to pass the summer on the shore of Lake Michigan . " What impressed him was the ability of American energy to concentrate itself equally on the dynamo and on the neoclassic Beaux-Arts style that dominated the fair . He sneered that the exposition " seemed to have leaped directly from Corinth and Syracuse and Venice , over the heads of London and New York , to impose classical standards on plastic Chicago . " Adams , a traditionalist in everything except the application of " science " to history , of course had no complaint against the Beaux-Arts style 's temporarily taking over Chicago . Perhaps he guessed that the marble-white facades were " staff , " plaster of paris . The fair was the first no-expense-barred movie set . With his synoptic gift for reading history at a glance , Adams reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading cities had always shown trader 's taste , and , to the stern purist of religious faith , no art was thinner than Venetian Gothic . All trader 's taste smelt of bric-a-brac ; Chicago tried at least to give her taste a look of unity . " * ? " Unity " was one of Adams 's central themes , along with " chaos " and " entropy , " which represented the opposite . " Unity " was an obsessive metaphor for any glorious past ( like the Middle Ages he was to celebrate as a museum with walls ? not for everybody ? in Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres ) . " Unity " stood for everything that had once been glorious , intact ? and was now multiplying , dissipating into the randomness of a market *In 1904 , sniffily disapproving of the " hard " prosperity he saw in New York 's Central Park , I lenry James yet consoled himself . It was not , certainly , for general style , pride and colour , a Paul Veronese company ... my vision has a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the children of a Republic and of trade ? "  | economy and mass society . The center of Adams 's thought , the inescapable background of his personal " failure , " was by the nineties the unlimited acceleration of change . The modern world was rushing madly to an explosion of its uncontrollable energy . How much his wife 's suicide in 1885 had to do with Adams 's insistence on world catastrophe Adams never confided to anyone . He hardly knew himself . Like some leading nonfailures of the new industrial era ? Mark Twain , Andrew Carnegie , Henry James ? Adams saw himself as the elegist of an innocent America obliterated by forces beyond control . " His world was dead , " he claimed to have felt as early as 1868 , when he returned to America after spending the Civil War in England as private secretary to his father , the American minister . Not a Polish Jew fresh from Warsaw or Cracow ? not a furtive Yacoob or Ysaac still reeking of the Ghetto , snarling a weird Yiddish to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an intenser energy , and a freer hand than he ? American of Americans , with Heaven knew how many Puritans and Patriots behind him , and an education that had cost a civil war .... He was no worse off than the Indians or the buffalo who had been ejected from their heritage by his own people ; but he vehemently insisted that ... the defeat was not due to him , nor yet to any superiority of his rivals . He had been unfairly forced out of the track , and must get back into it as best he could . Adams was a strenuously gifted man with the deepest possible instinct for showing his life as history . At the New York pier he could make a historical drama of his favorite hate , the East European Jews , though in 1868 they had not yet begun to arrive . At Chicago he had only to sit on the steps beneath Richard Morris Hunt 's Administration Building , the center of the exposition ( a golden dome , astonishing to still-rustic Midwesterners , was meant to recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Adams " to ponder . . . almost as deeply as on the steps of Ara Coeli " ? where Gibbon in 1754 conceived The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Hunt , the favorite neoclassic architect to industrial magnates , had obviously reversed Chicago 's natural trend by his classicism . Adams , as conservative in the arts as he was unbounded in historical speculation , wrote as if Chicago 's pseudoclassicism would elevate the dumb masses . If the rupture was real and the new American world could take this sharp and conscious twist towards ideals , one 's personal friends would come in , at last , as winners in the great American chariot-race for fame . If the people of the Northwest actually knew what was good when they saw it , they would some day talk about Hunt and Richardson , La Farge and St. Gaudens ,  | Burnham and McKim , and Stanford White when their politicians and millionaires were otherwise forgotten . The derision , as usual , was for both sides . Adams wrote that " art , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond shirt-stud ; a paper collar . " Easterners dominated the construction of the exposition as if by natural right . Chicago money wanted the tried and true , not pioneer functionalists like Louis Henri Sullivan . If the Chicago architect John Wellborn Root had not suddenly died just as the planning for the exposition began , it is possible that the stately white facade imposed on the lakefront , and interrupted only by Louis Sullivan 's Transportation Building , would not have had Root 's support . Harriet Monroe wrote in her biography of her brother-in-law that Root wished to admit frankly in the architectural scheme the temporary character of the fair : it should be a great , joyous , luxuriant midsummer efflorescence ... a splendid buoyant thing , flaunting its gay colors between the shifting blues of sky and lake exultantly , prodigally . . . . Edifices . . . should not give the illusion of a weight and permanence ; they should be lighter , gayer , more decorative than the solid structures along our streets . Louis Sullivan ?
