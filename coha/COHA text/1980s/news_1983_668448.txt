The whole sum and substance of this up-the-down-staircase season for the Patriots can be wrapped up in one lazy , muggy Saturday evening in the Orange Bowl . The Patriots were in the playoffs . That was good . The Patriots used much the same game plan they used a week earlier against Buffalo . That was not so good . The Patriots may have surprised everyone by making it to the Orange Bowl to play the Dolphins but they surprised no one , least of all the Dolphins , once they got there . So , too , the season : the Patriots were good , but they weren ' t that good . Just as in 1981 New England was 2-14 bad , but the Patriots weren ' t that bad . Perspective . It ' s never easy to gather the right perspective about this franchise and this team because there ' s never a moment of quiet and peace to collect the right thoughts . There always seems to be an earthquake rumbling out back , a train whistling by the open window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , you can ' t go too far wrong by assuming things aren ' t what they seem to be . Ron Meyer , for instance , was saying yesterday he is hopeful that the " concerns " on the team ( the word used to be " problems , " but 1984 is only a year away ) can be worked out , and he would do his best to resolve them . The coach ' s words were words of reconciliation . But John Hannah is still unhappy , Don Hasselbeck will be talking to the USFL , Andy Johnson and Sam Cunningham will be gone and Stanley Morgan will be talking this morning with Tony Pennacchia , his agent , for advice before meeting later today with Meyer . Morgan rightfully is a very unhappy man . Perspective again . Meyer must be credited for winning five games and bringing New England to the playoffs because other Patriot teams have faced similar possibilities and failed . But , frankly , three of the Patriots ' five wins came over bad teams , one was over Miami in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo . Three of the five losses , though , were one- sided blowouts to good teams . Next season , the schedule will not be as easy ; there will be more good teams . If these were the Baltimore Colts and Meyer had taken them to the playoffs , then all his words about rebuilding and progress would be credible . But the heart and soul of the good Patriot teams of 1976- 80 were still here when he took over , he was handed a flock of talented rookies to mold and the Patriots finally had some quick defensive players among the front seven linemen and linebackers . Frankly , this team should have been 5-4 . The truth is that some unnecessary " concerns " quickly developed and festered into open sores as the season wore on . The most unhappy players were generally the best players and even Meyer says that Hannah , Morgan , Hasselbeck et al were totally prepared on Sundays and gave their utmost . The players ' attitude , despite all the publicity , was not the problem . What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still more perspective . Meyer was a rookie coach this season and he made his rookie mistakes , just as did the rookie players . Meyer mishandled some personnel - Andy Johnson , of course , Matt Cavanaugh in Pittsburgh for openers - and his game preparation for several of the big games was badly lacking in strategy and inventiveness . Don Shula and Miami defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger clearly outcoached the Patriots . Most of all , though , Meyer ' s biggest rookie mistake was that he was inflexible much of the time . His way was the right way and the only way . He says he is listening to his players this week in their heart-to-hearts but isn ' t it late to be listening to constructive advice ? And will he listen to the same players next fall before the season starts and not just after it ? Perhaps Meyer has learned that it takes more than rules to mold respect . Perhaps Meyer has learned it takes more than talent to win in the NFL and that coaching and strategy gives the winners the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps Meyer has learned that his way is not the only way . If he has , then he will be a coach .
