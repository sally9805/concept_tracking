William J. Casey , director of central intelligence , findshimself embroiled in a controversy over his private business dealings . The propriety of some of those activities may be arguable , but there is no doubt that they have made him a rich man . His confidential statement to the Senate Intelligence Committee , provided during confirmation hearings last year and obtained by Newsday , lists his net worth at $9,647,089 . His stock portfolio is diverse , ranging from oil and oil- related stocks ( $2,069,037 ) to tobacco ( Philip Morris , valued at $347,000 ) . He values the cars he owns at $50,000 . A staunch Republican in politics , he can be bipartisan when it comes to economics , investing $200,000 in a California condominium project as an associate of Rep. James H. Scheuer , a liberal Democrat from Long Island . And Casey has shared his expertise . He has probably written more books on business and tax shelters - some of them with assistance - than Erle Stanley Gardner has written mysteries . The official scrutiny of Casey in recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official conduct . A Senate investigation into whether he misled stockholders and failed to inform the Senate of the extent of his holdings ended with a conclusion that he was " not unfit " toserve as head of the CIA . Now the Justice Department is investigating whetherhe violated a law by not registering as a foreign agent for the Indonesian government several years ago . Casey contends he was not required to register . The Indonesia matter was a small portion of Casey ' s activities as a businessman and lawyer . By his calculation , according to papers on file with the Senate Intelligence Committee , he earned only $12,675 for the work . Casey , a Long Island lawyer who was an attorney for the New York law firm of Rogers &; Wells when he handled the Indonesia case from 1976 to 1978 , wrote the committee , " I was compensated for my services through Rogers &; Wells ; my hourly rate at the time was approximately $260 per billable hour . " He informed the committee that he accumulated " only 48 and three quarters billable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the Indonesian-owned oil company ) between July 1976 and June 1978 . " Without going into detail , he freely wrote to the committee about the meetings he held with Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials on behalf of Indonesia - meetings now challenged in a Washington Post article as violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act . " I had a meeting at the Department of Treasury , " he stated , " and , I believe , two meetings at the Internal Revenue Service in the summer of 1976 . " By Casey ' s standards , the money he received for the service to Indonesia was minor . In his report to the Senate committee he gave the worth of his municipal bonds at $188,782 , his US government bonds at $19,343 and his equities at $7,505,013 . He also listed cash and cash equities of $23,951 . Among the criticisms of Casey is that he did not place his holdings in a blind trust when he was made CIA director , a post that gives him secret information that could be of financial benefit . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past CIA directors have each created one voluntarily . Many of Casey ' s investments are in companies that deal with the federal government , and within a month further federal aid may goto one of those firms . On Jan. 18 the US Synthetic Fuels Corp . will meet in Nashville to decide which of 27 firms should be awarded chunks of $8.4 billion in federal subsidies for experimental projects . One of those 27 applicants is a firm called Peat Methanol Associates , in which Casey indirectly holds a $10,000 interest . Peat Methanol Associates would like to build a $250-million plant in North Carolina that would turn peat into methanol , known as wood alcohol . But before that is done , the partnership would like a price guarantee of 75 cents for every gallon of alcohol its gigantic still would produce .
