I arrived the night before by roundabout cab and am completely disoriented . After nearly a full day in transit I have been able to sleep only four fitful hours . Now , it is 8 a. m. and 92 degrees and I am off to explore Bangkok feeling as groggy , giddy and dizzy as I ever have in my life . Still , I have found a clean , cool room for barely $10 and am quite smug . I ' m out to prove that the canny traveler can still see Asia on a shoestring . I hold out a handful of strange coins and the bus conductor selects a few . When a seat becomes available he insists that I sit down . We lurch and bound through nondescript streets , across plazas , around corners in a bus that had probably been in service in Sydney or Capetown or somewhere when I was born . Ten minutes later the conductor ushers me off the bus , gesturing and pointing . ( I had earlier shown him my destination on a map . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through an open air market of book stalls and out onto the parade ground called Sanam Luang . There before me beyond this vast open space and lined up majestically for review are several universities , a temple , the National theater , museum and library . And off to the south I can see the gilded spires and bright roofs of Bangkok ' s two great public monuments , the Grand Palace and the temple called Wat Po , famous for its huge reclining Buddha . But I am moving slowly . It is enough to be coping at all through this haze of fatigue , jet lag and heat . Everywhere I am approached by people who want to help me : cabbies who honk when they see me , students who will be my guide . But I wave them all away . I am doing quite well on my own , thank you . Perhaps that is why I stop Pircha : He doesn ' t stop me and he doesn ' t do a double take as if my pockets are overflowing with dollar bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entrance . " Excuse me , " I say . He replies , bowing with his hands cupped before him , and if I will just follow him . . . He is a slight young man of about 22 who is a typist for the Department of the Navy . He ' s working overtime this Saturday , but taking the afternoon off because it is a Buddhist holiday . Here is the entrance , but it is closed for the midday meal . If I would like to come with him , there is another temple he is just going to himself . Yes , I would . Thank you so much . We hurry along a busy street past a school yard of kids in blue and white uniforms , past the crowded , bustling shops of Chinatown , past the dark , dense blocks of the Indian market . The streets grow narrower and are clogged with noise and fumes and traffic . Pircha smiles . " Too much car , " he says . Then suddenly we are stepping off the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown , choppy Chao Phya River . The boat can hold 20 people , but we are the only passengers . I turn to Pircha : " How much will this cost ? I haven ' t much money . " He seems slightly embarrassed and tells me not to worry , saying something about the driver being a friend . The trip is short anyway . We step out on the crumbling steps of Wat Dusidaram and as we cross the grounds Pircha shows me small Buddhas and hidden shrines , one of which is a sexually explicit figure at which barren women pray . He talks of history and legend . Then we come in out of the white glare and look up , straight up at a great , golden Buddha which sits in lotus position almost 50 feet high . The temple is fragrant and shadowed and really much too small for the great statue it houses . Together Pircha and I remove our shoes , together we kneel and pray , sprinkle our arms with water , light sticks of incense , strike a gong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other tourists , I would never do these things . Then we are back in the boat , exploring the old city of Thonburi , Bangkok ' s poor sister across the river , on the brown canals called klongs that wind everywhere . It is a journey through time as well as place for here , free of the noise , hassle , hustle , traffic and fumes of the drab , modern city , there are remnants of life as it was lived a hundred or more years ago . Finally we are stepping off onto a wobbly pier and I am following Pircha down a dark alley so narrow that I can touch both sides standing in the middle . It turns and then empties us into a rambling complex of temples . Pircha takes my arm and guides me through a swinging gate . In front of us is an ornate open air monastary two stories tall and the size of a very large house . Through a gilded archway the temple ' s grounds and plazas are crowded with worshipers . Pircha and I buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-sized gold Buddha around which women and children cluster . We touch it in good health . It is soft as wadded foil . Back at the klong Pircha leads me onto a bare wooden porch above the water where there is a single small table and two chairs . We sit and almost magically a woman appears with a large ice cold bottle of Singha beer and a dish of nuts . We struggle through a conversation about Rambo , John Wayne , The A-Team and Ronald Reagan . He likes them all . He is also quick to tell me that he does not like communists , significant in that this is the only country on the peninsula that has not fallen to them . We talk of the World Cup . No , it is not my game . I like baseball . He has never heard of it . But when I mention that I am from Chicago , he lights up . " Ah , Chicago Bears . Refrigerator Perry , yes ? " " Yes . " We draw maps of our own countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays for another big , cold beer . He insists . I am his guest . I can hardly believe I am here . It is all so exotic and sudden . I am perhaps a little sentimental with the strong beer and say I must have a photo of Pircha sitting right here beside the klong to remember this moment by . But , no , I can not take his picture because it is a Holy Day . You understand . But , of course . So I shoot the empty table with the nuts and beaded beer bottles . When our launch comes back , we are off into the churning Chao Phya , skimming along past government buildings and more wats and handsome villas and private clubs where diplomats bat balls on grass tennis courts . Suddenly we are idling just off the pier and I am holding my wallet , insisting that I pay , actually anticipating resistance . There is an exchange between Pircha and the driver and now Pircha is plucking bills out of my wallet , pulling one after another . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Three hours , you see , and there are many empty seats . . . " " But you said . . . how much does he want ? " " Twenty-five hundred baht . " " Gosh , that seems . . . now just wait . . . " as again he is reaching gingerly toward my money and bills are passing over my shoulder . Then Pircha is helping me onto the slippery pier and I have a foot still in the boat , open wallet in one hand , swinging camera in the other , slowly doing the splits . " Now wait a minute ! " Then we are watching the boat bounce away across the waves and I am saying , " My God , Pircha , 2 , 500 baht ! My God , that ' s . . . that ' s almost a hundred dollars ! A hundred bucks ! " He is bowing and dipping frantically . And if I will only come to his house , he will pay me . He is so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , " I say taking his hand firmly . " But now I must go . I am late . Thank you so much and goodbye . " I have to get away from him . I turn and flee , which I only realize some blocks later is just what he wanted me to do . Just exactly . Or did he ? I am so afraid of being an ugly American . I walk for miles and hours . As a kind of punishment I refuse to allow myself a cab or even a bus ride . And as I go , the events of the day turn over and over and over again in my mind . My gosh , that driver was trusting . We never left any money with him , did we ? And how did he know when to come back each time ? Then there were Pircha ' s seemingly harmless questions about me . When had I arrived ? And you must be very tired . Is it your first trip ? Do you speak Thai ? And the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why was it that I could take all the photos I wanted of Buddhists in Buddhist temples on this Buddhist holiday , but just none of him ? Son of a gun . Several times I nearly turn back toward the river , but Pircha will be long gone and the boatman will simply idle away if I approach . What could I do if he didn ' t ? And how could I even begin to explain all of this to police officers who don ' t speak English ? It is hopeless . And then there was all that talk of Reagan and Rambo . I buy a soft drink and sit in a little park trying to reconstruct our conversation . " My God ! " I realize suddenly . " He is a capitalist ! I am the downtrodden masses and he is a rapacious capitalist ! I have been ruthlessly exploited by capitalism ! " At dusk I am weary and lost . I hail a cab and show the driver the address of my hotel . One hundred twenty-five baht  --  $5 . Not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first corner and stops at my front door . We have not traveled a hundred yards . I smile and shake my head and pay up without a peep . CAPTION : DRAWING : Tribune illustration by Arn Arnam . Illustration DRAWING <>
