txt IT HAPPENED THIS whiter , on Dec. 8 . A 12-year-old girl was heading home from St. Timothy 's Grammar School . A man followed her as she crossed the school playlet , He came up from behind her , put his hand over her mouth , and said , ' ' Do n't talk or I 'll kill you , " He dragged the girl into the basement of a nearby building in the 2700 block of West Rosemont Avenue where a rug had been thrown on the floor . The man had a gun in a black holster . The girl was terrified , She begged him , " Please let me go . " He responded , " Do what I say or I 'll kill you , " Then he raped her and fled . THE GIRL WAS taken first to the hospital . Then she talked to the police . She gave them a description of her attacker . A police artist drew a composite drawing of his face and for weeks , police brought in suspects for the girl to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who dragged her into the basement . On March 5 , three months later , two ' tactical unit policemen , Frank Costello and Mike Mason , from the Rogers Park district , stopped a car on the street . One of the men in the car looked familiar . Very familiar . His face matched the drawing of the suspect wanted ' for rape . Last Monday night the girl identified that man in a lineup at the Belmont Area station as the man who raped her last December in the basement on West Rosemont Avenue . The man she identified was John Spires , 25 . He is now locked up and awaiting trial on a Class X rape charge that , it he Is found guilty , calls for a sentence of six years in prison without parole . Up until now John Spires has been is very lucky man . Two weeks ago I wrote about him . On Oct. 17 , he rang the doorbell of Kathy Carden 's apartment on the Northwest side . She heard him jiggling her door downstairs as if trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only through the closed door . He claimed he was looking for a girl . Kathy said she had never heard of this girl . He asked whether the girl lived in her basement apartment . Kathy said no , she did not . Then she went upstairs . Suspicious , she went out on the back-porch and ' she saw , him two buildings away ripping out the basement trap door of her neighbors , George and Marge Wenzel . Once he ripped the door off and climbed into their house , Kathy called police . They were there , she says , in two minutes . And they caught Spires inside the house . SPIRES , ON PAROLE for rape at the time , was charged with criminal damage to property . But at a preliminary hearing Judge John Reynolds ruled no probable cause , despite the fact that the Wenzels ' trap door had been nailed shut with 3-inch nails and two-by-fours because of a previous burglary , and despite the fact that police found him illegally inside their house . Shortly afterwards , however , Spires was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglary . On Feb. 18 , In a bench trial before Judge Robert Sklodowski , Spires was found not // Suspect in rape familiar fellow // guilty of the attempted burglary of the Wenzels ' house and walked out free again . Free as a breeze . John Spires has been arrested for burglary many times in his life . Of 19 arrests since he was 17 , seven have been for burglary . He never went to jail for any of them . BUT AFTER EIGIIT arrests , he was put on probation by one Cook County judge for one of the burglary charges . The probation , however , did not straighten him out . It did not make him think things over and walk the tightrope . Instead , three months after he was put on probation , he was convicted Downstate of aggravated battery . Downstate , they do not put up with long records . They are not as patient . They are not as open-minded as judges are here . Spires was sent to prison for aggravated battery . He did not stay long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condition somewhat like probation . It is ** to make the person think about whet he does . He is supposed to stay clean , and stay out of trouble . But just as probation seemingly meant nothing to Spires , neither did parole . He promptly was arrested seven more times while on parole ? with nothing happening to him in the courts as a result ? until the parole board suddenly woke up and realized that he had gotten into lots of trouble and that in itself was a violation of parole . SO SPIRES WAS sent to Joliet State Prison for violating parole . His punishment was not severe . He served one month and three days . Then he was back on parole from prison for violating parole . Still , parole did not seem to sink in . For , while still on parole , and six months out of prison , Spires was arrested for rape . It was a rape very much like the December rape for it , too , was the rape of a 12-year-old girl ? pulled into a basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Spires and forced to watch the act . That was in 1976 . Spires was ruled by Judge Fred Suria to be incompetent to stand rrial . He was sent to a mental health facility . Two years later , he was judged-.competent and Spires pleaded guilty to the rape in the basement . He was sentenced by Suria to six years in prison . But in one year and five months he was back out on the street . Of course , on parole again . WHILE ON parole this time , he was arrested for criminal damage to property . The charge , before Judge John Bowe , was dropped . Nothing happened to Spires ' aprole status . Then he was arrested for breaking into the Wenzel 's house . The preliminary charges were dropped and Spires was back on the street . It was at this time that the Dec. 8 rape of the second 12-year-old girl occurred . Spires was then indicted for attempted burglary ? with no one yet knowing about the rape because he had not been identified ? and then found not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 has been on either probation or parole and yet been arrested 14 times during that period . Apparently , for , him , neither forms of punishment work . SPIRES IS still a very lucky man . In his 17th arrests he has only been convicted 3 times , and one of those times he pleaded guilty . The detective who arrested Spires in 1978 for raping a 12-year-old was shocked to hear of the recent charge . He was shocked to hear that Spires was even back out on the street . " I 'm surprised to hear he 's out , " the detective said . " But I 'm not surprised to hear that he has done it again . Back then ( in 1978 ) I thought he was a truly danger-. ous man . " Says Sklodowski , who most recently found Spires not guilty of attempted burglary , when he heard of the latest rape charge , " I do n't know what to say . Evidence that a defendant has been previously convicted of a crime can only be considered insofar as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as evidence of his guilt of the crime for which he is being tried . " THEN HE added , " If he was before me now on this ( the rape ) charge , I would have to recuse ( disqualify ) myself because I could n't give him a fair trial . " I 'd convict him . It 's awful he is wandering the streets . It makes me sick . I have two daughters myself . It 's a tough burden for a judge . Frankly , our system has a lot of faults , but it is based on a presumption of innocence ? not a presumption guilty . " John Spires is an example of many of the faults in the Cook County judicial system . Granted , he is presumed innocent until proven guilty . But the man has spent seven years either on probation or parole . And he did not stay out of trouble . He did not stay clear of the law . The charges only just got worse , and more serious . Violating his parole Or probation did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than just riddled with faults . It seems to have cracked wide open .
