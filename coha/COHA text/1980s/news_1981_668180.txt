PISCATAWAY , N.J. - What the hell , it was just your basic five- minute drill , inside of which was contained your standard two- minute , one-minute , seven-second and one-second drills . It was one whole clinic of drills , the kind of drills the Celtics have been famous for since 1956 or so . Which is to say that having found themselves trailing by 12 points with exactly five minutes to go , the Celtics did not mentally check out of the game . Rather , they checked themselves in with a two- way ferocity that would bear fruit in the form of a 117-115 triumph over the jinxed New Jersey Nets last evening . The season ' s first capacity crowd ( 8774 ) at the Rutgers Athletic Center was thrilled by a spectacular Celtic comeback that included a succession of Boston defensive sets that may forever set the standard of excellence in similar situtations . Exaggeration ? Hardly . For in the last 4:33 , the Celtics created two turnovers , blocked three shots and induced one air ball , along with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this game when it appeared that the New Jersey state junior high school champs had won a radio contest and their prize was an attempt to score a point against the Boston Celtics . With the defense assuring the Celtics of quick possessions , offense almost became an afterthought . For the record , the Celtics took the lead for good at 112-111 on a free throw by Larry ( 13 for 22 ) Bird with 1:32 to play , went up by three at 114-111 on a third- chance left-handed flip by Bird with 49 seconds to play , secured another key three-point advantage ( 116-113 ) on a Kevin McHale ( oh , yes , six more blocks ) jump hook with 16 seconds left and clinched the game with a second left when Tiny Archibald made the second of three foul shots and then banged the third off the rim to allow the clock to run out . The Celtics had gotten themselves into this fine mess ( which included two 16-point third-quarter deficits , the second at 82-66 with 6:33 left ) by being unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59 percent in the first half , tacked on a 57 percent third quarter and thus entered the final period leading by a 97-87 margin . The leading bombardier was Cliff Robinson , who had 14 of his 30 points in the first period , and 28 of his 30 by the end of the third . There had been a game for one and a half periods ( 28 lead changes ) before a 12-1 Net run ( one field goal ) keyed a 25-11 surge over the last 7:40 , sending the home team off the floor a 67-55 halftime lead . But New Jersey kept applying the pressure for the first 19 minutes of the second half , until with precisely five minutes remaining they were firmly in possession of a 109-97 lead . Moreover , Cedric Maxwell had just been fouled out . At 4:58 Bill Fitch called a 20-second time out , during which time he changed the offense , putting Bird ( 29 points , 10 rebounds ) and Archibald ( 26 points , 10 assists ) outside and camping McHale and foul-plagued Robert Parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Gerry Henderson , and he took advantage of the new alignment to explode down the lane for a three-point play that started the Celtics back . What transpired from that point on was naught but a Boston highlight film , even as it was a Nets ' screw-up manual . New Jersey ' s woes began when Mike Gminski lost a basket at 4:33 ( it would have given his team a 111-100 lead ) on a clear travel . Bird immediately hit a long jumper and a block of a Darwin Cook shot leading to an Archibald fast break . The barn door had now been flung wide open . Boston ' s defense did it all . You want blocks ? How about McHale ( a flustered Robinson ) and Parish ( Gminski ) ? Strips ? ( Henderson on Mike O ' Koren . ) General harrassment ? ( Henderson forcing a Mike Newlin air ball at 109-104 . ) And then there were the fast breaks , such as a textbook Henderson ( rebounding an O ' Koren miss ) - to- Bird- t o Parish fast break that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1:30 , when Bob Rakel took away McHale ' s awesome overhead tap-in of a Bird free throw miss . Even New Jersey ' s last hoop came as the result of a big Boston defensive play , when Parish sent back a Gminski jumper into the hands of Lowes Moore , who canned a jumper with 35 seconds left to pull New Jersey within one at 116-115.
