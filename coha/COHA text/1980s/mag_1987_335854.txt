Lieut . Colonel Oliver North spent nearly three years coordinating arms purchases and helping to raise money for the contra rebels fighting in Nicaragua . But none of North 's secret activities may prove as vital to the rebels as his testimony before the Iran-contra committees . As millions of Americans watched on television , North pleaded passionately for support of efforts to overthrow Nicaragua 's Marxist Sandinista junta . He was even permitted to deliver his patented fund-raising pitch , minus the projection of 57 slides that usually accompany the spiel . Holding a photograph of a makeshift contra grave , North , his voice choking , told the legislators , " Gentlemen , we 've got to offer them something more than the chance to die for their own country and the freedoms that we believe in . " <P> Ollie 's salesmanship provided the opportunity for long-demoralized contra backers at the White House and State Department to mount a new campaign for aid . As a Washington Post/ABC News poll indicated that public support for military aid to the contras rose to 43% on July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called North 's testimony " helpful . " President Reagan echoed North in his weekly radio commentary . " The American people are tired of the off-on again policy in Central America , " he said . <P> The Administration may soon ask Congress to approve long-term aid to the contras of perhaps $150 million over 18 months , up from the $100 million narrowly okayed last fall for fiscal 1987 . That would keep the rebels in beans and bullets until Ronald Reagan leaves office . <P> The contras ' efforts in the field have also given a boost to their cause . The Administration says the rebels have put nearly 15,000 soldiers inside Nicaragua , up from 5,000 last December . Last week the contras announced that 500 soldiers attacked and overran a strongly held Sandinista garrison at San Jose de Bocay in north-central Nicaragua . Although the Defense Ministry in Managua announced fewer casualties and a much less successful assault than contra leaders claimed , the insurgents said it was their biggest victory since the rebellion began six years ago . Contra military progress could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue comes to a vote this fall . <P> Yet opponents remain confident that Congress will refuse to renew the funding . " Even after six days of Ollie North , there is still no clear majority in favor of contra aid , " said Michigan Congressman Dave Bonior , chief deputy Democratic whip . " I think we have an excellent chance of cutting off aid . " Predictions of a complete cutoff were widespread last fall when it was first learned that the Administration had been circumventing congressional restrictions on support for the rebels . But lawmakers now admit that any new aid package must be considered apart from the scandal . " With North 's testimony , there 's obviously a mood in Congress that the issue of contra aid needs to be handled on its merits , " admits California Democrat Leon Panetta , a contra opponent .
