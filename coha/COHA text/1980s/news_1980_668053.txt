Stare straight ahead and he could see the new $2 million scoreboard at County Stadium doing all sorts of things . HOME RUN . HOME RUN . HOME RUN . Letters flashing , 20 feet tall . Look to the left a little bit and he could see a man called Bernie Brewer , dressed in a little Bavarian outfit , go sliding down a chute into a giant mug of beer , a bunch of balloons released into the air as Bernie landed . Look anywhere else , listen , and he could see people , hear people , 53,313 of them , standing and stomping and shouting his name . Going absolutely crazy . Sixto ! The people called and he had to answer . He walked up the three steps of the Milwaukee Brewers ' dugout , stood straight and tall , almost at attention , and removed his blue hat and held it high . And smiled . The curtain call was his . The whole damned town was his . At last . " I never had one of those before , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the emotions of the ovation and the game-winning , ninth-inning grand slam that had prompted it . " I always wondered what it would feel like . " " What did it feel like ? " " How do you think it felt ? " Sixto Lezcano said . " I thought I would have a stroke . " He was the Red Sox killer supreme . He was the hero ' s hero . One day into this baseball season and his hit had energized it , zapped it into life as if shot with a bolt of electricity from Dr. Frankenstein ' s magic machine . Two outs in the ninth . Bases loaded . First pitch . Whocka , whocka , whocka . Dead into the right-field seats . Brewers 9 , Red Sox 5 . " I wasn ' t looking to hit any home run , " the 26-year-old right fielder said . " I wasn ' t even thinking about it . I just wanted to hit the ball somewhere they couldn ' t catch it . I was thinking wild pitch , passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The one thing he said he wanted to do was to go to the plate ready to swing . He had been crouched for a long time in the on-deck circle while Gorman Thomas , the hitter , had gone through one of those prolonged dance-of-death confrontations with Dick Drago , the Red Sox pitcher . While Thomas fouled off pitches and strung the count to three balls and two strikes , then fouled off some more before taking the fourth ball and the walk , Lezcano both dreaded and anticipated his own little trip into the spotlight . " It ' s one of those things , you say to yourself , Oh , no , the pressure , it ' s going to be mine , ' but at the same time when you get up there you enjoy it , " he said . " When I stood up to go the plate , I mostly felt cold . " It was really cold out there . My face felt empty . Numb . I just went up there looking for a fastball to hit because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . " The pitch , the one he drilled into the seats , was low and away from him . Not a hitter ' s pitch , really , but one he thought was worth the chance . He swung hard , as he always swings , 5 feet 10 , 175 pounds , but muscular enough to be a home run hitter . Whocka , whocka , whocka . " I didn ' t think the ball was going out , " he said . " I thought maybe it would hit off the wall or something . I looked up , thought , and there it was . . . " Sixto ! The reaction to the hit was almost as beautiful to Lezcano as the hit itself , because he has had some hard times in Milwaukee . There have been a lot of times he has not liked Milwaukee very much , and there have been a lot of times he has been sure Milwaukee has not liked him very much . How do you explain it all in a few paragraphs ? He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has had all of the familiar problems . Language . ( " I first came here and all I ate , every night , was cheeseburger and Coke , the only words I knew on the menu . " ) Social . ( " I do not smile , " he once told a Milwaukee writer . " I never smile . " ) Whatever . He has feuded with managers , kicked water coolers , has lived without a lot of friends , a Puerto Rican guy lost in the cold . The words that have been used about him - " aloof , " " loner , " " Sixto Superstar , thinks he ' s better than everyone else " - have sometimes been misguided words , sometimes have been right , but whatever the case have been words he could not fight . How do you argue if you don ' t know the language ? He has ridden uneasily for a long time here . In the last two years , though , a number of things have happened . He has picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has married , fathered a son . He has found a manager he likes , George Bamberger . He has - for lack of a better term - settled in . " I like it here , " he said yesterday . " These are the people who signed me when I was 16 years old . These are the people who have stuck with me . I am as ready for this baseball season as I ever have been for any season . I want to repay all of these people , show them what I can do . " He then dedicated this game , this hit , this season to all of these people who have made his life suddenly so pleasant . The people of Milwaukee . . . dedicated . His teammates . . . dedicated . His wife and child . . . dedicated . Bamberger , the manager who now is recovering from open-heart surgery in Florida . . . especially dedicated . " He is the best human being-manager I ever have had , " Sixto Lezcano said . " He is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , they showed him on the scoreboard screen and he had a message for us . I looked at him . You could see he had a little water in his eyes while he talked , and I thought about him a lot . The last thing he said was that we all should have a beer on him after the game . " The hero snapped open a cold can of Pabst and took a long swallow . The photographers clicked . Smile . " So here it is , " the happy man said . " This one ' s on George . Just the way he wanted it to be . "
