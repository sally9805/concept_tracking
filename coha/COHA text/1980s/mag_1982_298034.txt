FAMILY TRADE by James Carroll ; Little , Brown ; 417 pages ; $14.95 <P> No one has founded a Thriller-of-the-Week Club , but the raw material is certainly available . Rare is the seven-day stretch that does not yield up yet another fictional secret agent trying to foil yet another diabolical plot against civilization . The continuing popularity of espionage books should be no mystery . They offer vicarious thrills to the deskbound , the fantasy that a lone hero can triumph over institutionalized evil . Such tales also feed a widespread , heartfelt suspicion : the world can not be this messy and dangerous by accident . Someone is plotting all this on purpose . The feeling is not new . Faced with a similarly uncertain existence , the ancient Greeks imagined themselves controlled by peevish and capricious gods . Thrillers have simply repopulated the pantheon with bureaucrats , apparatchiks and hired gunsels . <P> Family Trade closely follows the iron-curtained rule of its genre . Those who like their espionage fast paced and complicated will not be disappointed . Big issues are at stake here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance . Winston Churchill and Allen Dulles appear in walk-on roles . An ordinary man is suddenly entangled in a web of deceptions , risking his life for reasons he does not understand . But Author James Carroll , 39 , makes these familiar conventions seem fresh and even plausible . His characters are not puppets of the plot . They grow and change . They struggle with divided loyalties , knowing that their secret activities on behalf of some grand design force them to lie to their loved ones , betray them if necessary . <P> In 1960 a Georgetown University freshman named Jake McKay spots his father , " one of the most powerful men on the quiet side of Washington , " at an art museum .

Jake 's father , after a period of debriefing by his CIA superiors , suffers a stroke . Jake , already physically crippled since infancy by the explosion of a V-2 rocket that hit his parents ' house in London , now comes down with a debilitating case of moral paralysis . His family is in tatters , and the two men he loved most are beyond his question : " How can I be on the team when nobody tells me what we 're playing ? " <P> A flashback to 1945 begins to unravel the tangles . John McKay Sr. and Giles Patterson lead a joint U.S.-British commando raid into the heart of Berlin . Their ostensible purpose is to destroy the air plane that is ready to lift Hitler from the burning city . Their real job is to keep German nuclear research out of the hands of the invading Soviets .
