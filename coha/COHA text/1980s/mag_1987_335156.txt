It is true , as you note in your article on the attempt to make prison sentences more uniform ( ( LAW , April 27 ) ) , that a 10% increase in the prison population over the next decade would be intolerable . But the actual increase could be vastly greater . If just one piece of legislation like last year 's drug bill , which calls for stiffer sentencing , is factored in , the increase will be much larger . We simply can not lock everybody up . Something has got to give . Congress must choose : either allocate many billions of dollars for new prisons , or use imprisonment only where necessary and make greater use of such alternatives as fines , restitution , supervised home confinement , community service and probation , particularly for nonviolent and first offenders . <P> H.
