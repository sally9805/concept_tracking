Her sportswear is renowned for its sexy variations on the sweatshirt , but lately Designer Norma Kamali has been perspiring about her unwanted association with a different fashion tradition : the sweatshop . Last week the New York State department of labor said it had slapped Kamali with a record $10,000 fine for illegally employing workers to cut and sew garments for her at home . It was the first time a big-name designer had been singled out for breaking the state 's 1935 sweatshop law . Kamali stopped using the homeworkers , mostly Hispanic and Asian , when state labor officials began in December to look into complaints from the International Ladies Garment Workers Union . Partly because of the lost production , the designer decided to stop supplying clothes to any stores other than her two Manhattan shops .
