Despite a double-header loss to Naperville Central on Saturday , Glenbard North is still having a banner season . The Panthers are 20-7 , 14-3 in the Du Page Valley Conference . All this for a team that hoped to be respectable in the preseason . " We wanted to be in the top half of our conference , " said Glenbard coach Paul Peterson . " We were not picked to win the conference . I guess with what we ' re doing , we ' re kind of a dark horse . " Glenbard North is on top , barely ahead of Naperville Central ( 16-11 , 13-4 ) . Wheaton North , which sports an 12-5 conference mark , is third . The key to Glenbard ' s success has been pitcher Erin Dwyer , who ' s 7-0 with a 0. 83 earned-run average . Steve Szymkowiak , another righty , is 6-2 as the No. 2 starter , and leads the club with a . 463 batting average . Other important Panthers are outfielder John Walters and junior catcher Tony Rigitano . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterson . " Things just clicked from the start . Conference will still be a fight , but I think we can do it . " Girls soccer Naperville North continues to win . Naperville North continues to be No. 1 . Naperville North continues to dominate all comers-despite losing the player considered by many to be the finest in the state . Naperville North is 3-0 since all-state forward Jenny Sovacool suffered torn anterior cruciate knee ligaments May 2 . Reconstructive surgery will be performed in June , which means Sovacool will be redshirted at the University of Dayton , where she will attend on a soccer scholarship . " The knee is completely torn , " said Huskies coach Alan Harris . " She can ' t do any more damage to it . After the scope ( arthroscopic surgery ) and with rehabilitation and wearing a brace , her doctors say she ' ll be back in two or three weeks , but I don ' t think she will . Jennifer Thompson , one of our other standout players from last year , had surgery in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland next fall . " Without Sovacool , Huskie opponents tend to lick their chops . Go right ahead , says Harris . " Teams treat us with more respect with Jenny than without her , " said Harris . " I just think that with Jenny in the lineup , we ' re more likely to make a mistake and recover from it . Now it ' s going to go down to either a mistake or having a game go to overtime . " I felt before the season started that there were about 20 good teams . Nineteen of them didn ' t have Jenny Sovacool . Now , 20 don ' t . We ' re not a bad team without her . Yes , we ' re not quite as effective without her . But the reason we beat people is because they don ' t have the talent we do anyway . Someone ' s going to have to pick up the slack with Jenny being out . There are no excuses . Excuses are for losers . " Track and field Downers Grove South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series meets are scored on a 6-4-3-2-1 basis , but nobody saw that in their packets of materials from the IHSA and began scoring the meet based on 10 points for a first-place finish . But when Wheaton North coach Ellen Cwick questioned the scoring procedure midway through the meet , officials checked , of all things , a media guide , and found their error . It was nothing an eraser couldn ' t fix.
