The goal : to establish labor early on as the decisive element in the Democrats ' bid for the White House . " If we do not do what we propose to do , we shall be reviled as toothless and irrelevant , " said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland at the time . " If we succeed , we shall be condemned for daring to aspire to a share of power in our society . " <P> Unspoken , however , was a third possibility : that the Democratic nominee might lose , with labor 's support proving as much a hindrance as a help . That is what happened on Election Day . Up against a popular President and a humming economy , union leaders were simply unable to call home the once monolithic " labor vote . " What is more , the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate Republicans-whom Mondale needed in order to defeat Ronald Reagan . " The public is looking for someone who works for them , " says Political Analyst Alan Baron . " It does n't mean they hate labor . It just means they want somebody who 's independent . " <P> Mondale had been endorsed by every major union except the Teamsters , who opted for Reagan . After stumbling badly in the early primaries , Mondale relied on union money and muscle to grind down Gary Hart in New York , Pennsylvania , Illinois and Michigan .

" I do n't even read the stuff they send me , " says Robert McConnachie , a Reagan sup porter who belongs to the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees in Avon Township , Mich . " They ca n't tell me how to vote . " Just as important , a dwindling percentage of the work force is in the labor movement . According to the Bureau of National Affairs , a private research group , 17.9% of the work force was unionized in 1982 , down from 24.7% in 1970 . <P> Many union members picked Reagan for the same reasons other voters did : his sunny optimism and his stands on pocketbook and patriotism issues . Ironically , by negotiating ever higher wages , many unions have helped their members climb into the middle class , where they perceive their economic interests to be better served by the G.O.P. <P> Reagan 's stand-tall image also held appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ill. , Chrysler plant why they planned to vote for Reagan , they said they feared Mondale would reinstate the anemic foreign policy of the Carter Administration . Says Fraser : " The macho factor was important . "
