Exploring the ozone loss <P> When the Government cracked down on the use of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol sprays three years ago , a major row erupted . Some scientists welcomed the ban , contending that the synthetic compounds-like Freon - were destroying the earth 's ozone layer , a shield against the sun 's ultraviolet rays . They warned that loss of ozone could cause more cancer and perhaps alter the weather . Other scientists pooh-poohed such doomsday scenarios as unproved . <P> Last week the controversy was revived when Donald Heath , a physicist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , reported actual evidence of ozone depletion . His study , based on long-term weather satellite observations , indicated a reduction of about 1% in total ozone volume , with most of the losses concentrated at an altitude of about 25 miles . Though Heath acknowledged that his findings could not be tied directly to the chemicals , he pointed out that there is a suggestive link : calculations have shown that if chlorofluorocarbons were , in fact , damaging atmospheric ozone , the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert Wiser , an EPA science adviser , called the findings no more than " mildly suggestive . " One problem , added Shelby Tilford , NASA 'S chief of atmospheric processes , is that the amount of ozone may fluctuate with variations in the sun 's ultraviolet radiation . To help settle the argument , Harvard 's James G. Anderson plans to launch a huge balloon , 450 ft. in girth , in New Mexico next fall . Equipped with a battery of sensitive devices , its gondola will move up and down like a yo-yo through the upper atmosphere , between altitudes of 12 miles and 25 miles , not only measuring the ozone but detecting chemicals that may be destroying it .
