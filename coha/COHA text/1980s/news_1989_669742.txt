The current scale of narcotics trafficking in Europe is modest by United States standards , but British police and customs officials anticipate an early onslaught as drug suppliers begin switching their attention from North America to Western Europe ' s potentially lucrative market. // The Home Office in London is still evaluating forecasts that European narcotics problems will escalate in the wake of President Bush ' s antidrug campaign. // Available statistics are incomplete but point to a significant European narcotics problem that could get a lot worse if traffickers step up their activities . In Britain the amount of cocaine seized 10 years ago was a mere 30 pounds . Now it is running at about 1 , 100 pounds a year . In the first six months of this year 660 pounds of cocaine were seized by customs officers . Customs and police concede that this is only a tiny amount in proportion to the cocaine entering Britain. // // Europewide , a similar trend toward wider use of hard drugs , particularly cocaine , is detectable . Interpol reported last May that in 1988 nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the European Community - double the quantity in 1987 . Interpol pinpoints Spain as Europe ' s future drug gateway . The country has close connections with Latin America . Last year Spanish police seized three tons of cocaine , about 40 percent of it thought to have come from Colombia. // From Spain , police believe , the drug is carried aboard huge container lorries ( trucks ) on Europe ' s complex network of highways to many destinations . Britain ' s Home Secretary , Douglas Hurd , says that the problem of drugs crossing European frontiers is likely to increase sharply after 1992 when the EC is due to remove internal barriers to trade . He has clashed with senior European Commission officials in Brussels who want to press ahead with dismantling customs posts in the EC ' s member countries. // A downward price spiral for hard drugs is also becoming apparent . According to Scotland Yard officials , who are now exchanging information with European counterparts , the price of cocaine is falling . Two years ago it was $3 , 400 an ounce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200. // Some British medical experts note a sharp swing toward the use of the cocaine derivative , crack , which is turning up in several parts of London , as well as Liverpool , Cardiff , and other major cities . According to Dr. Strang , head of a drug dependency unit at a London hospital , two years ago 17 percent of cocaine users smoked crack or similar substances . This year the figure is running at around 64 percent. // Disturbing parallels between experience in the US and patterns in European countries are beginning to appear . For example , Derek Todd , head of Scotland Yard ' s drug squad , notes that , as in New York , a high proportion of Britain ' s drug peddlers are from Caribbean countries. // Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has warned that drugs could devastate European cities if there is not a concerted campaign against them . Last week , she strongly endorsed President Bush ' s antidrug campaign and said Britain was sending a team of specialist advisers to Colombia to help the government there in its attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a lack of shared information about drug use and methods of control . She plans to call an international conference on drugs early next year which could begin to generate data on which Europewide antidrug measures can be based. // But even at the national level , getting a grip on drug trafficking and abuse has proved difficult . Ben Whitaker , a former British government minister and author of an influential book about the international narcotics trade , ' ' The Global Fix , ' ' says European countries at present are poorly prepared to cope with a concerted attempt by drug traffickers in Latin America and elsewhere to penetrate their cities. // ' ' We may have as little as one year to take precautionary measures , ' ' Mr. Whitaker says . ' ' At present we can be certain that only a tiny proportion of hard drugs destined for the British market is discovered at ports of entry . Even if we tighten up at airports , there is our huge coastline to police. ' ' // Typically , only three customs officers police Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from continental European ports . Whitaker notes that private pleasure boats plying between continental Europe and Britain can easily elude customs scrutiny. // Facts like these have prompted Home Secretary Hurd to consider the formation of a combined squad comprising Scotland Yard , regional anticrime groups , and Customs Department officials . The squad would operate as a single unit . At present , coordination between various agencies of government with an interest in combatting drugs is cumbersome. // Hurd also plans to press his counterparts in EC countries to support the formation of a European drug intelligence unit , patterned on a national unit already operating at Scotland Yard . As long ago as 1971 , the late President Georges Pompidou of France proposed that EC interior ministers should meet to deal with the international drug problem . Hurd hopes the Pompidou Group will meet more regularly to intensify intergovernmental consultation on drugs. // How best to deal with the likely flood of hard drugs is sparking a lively debate in Britain . The influential Economist magazine last week argued editorially for the legalization of narcotics . It contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol by making its legal and by keeping prices high . The same approach should be used toward hard drugs. // Hurd replied that the argument was faulty . His officials are worried , for example , that if crack were to become freely available , as in the United States , it would be used extensively by poorer people in Britain ' s inner cities , leading to an explosion of crime . Scotland Yard officials have begun making raids on ' ' crack factories ' ' in parts of London. // The clash of views over methods of controlling drug use once the substances reach British cities also parallels arguments raging in the United States. // Mr. Todd of Scotland Yard favors heavier policing of suspected drug peddlers and users . ' ' Crack is so serious that we simply must stamp it out , ' ' he says. // Author Whitaker puts his faith in education . ' ' I am convinced of the need for a massive media campaign , ' ' he says . ' ' It should not focus on individual drugs . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from alcohol to the hardest narcotics . Only when we get the message across that abusing one ' s body is foolish and dangerous will we begin to make progress. ' ' // He adds that in Britain there is only one death from hard drugs for every 1 , 000 deaths caused by alcohol abuse . ' ' To be effective we should persuade people that all drugs are harmful . Crack is only one menace among many. ' ' // //
