The news made it even more likely that Frontier would file for bankruptcy protection , a fate that has been delayed day by day as the airline ' s parent , People Express , tried desperately to find a new buyer for the Denver-based carrier. // Yesterday morning , a People Express spokesman announced that the filing would take place by the end of the day . But in the evening , People said the bankruptcy filing was being deferred. // Several sources close to People said that the filing should take place today. // United had agreed to buy Frontier for $146 million last month , but it said in a statement yesterday that " the airline we attempted to purchase does not exist anymore . " <> <> United Cites ' Damage ' // It added : " We believe it is impossible to resurrect this deal after the damage done by these delays and the results of the closure of Frontier Airlines. " // Frontier suspended its operations on Sunday , inconveniencing tens of thousands of travelers and making it uncertain whether travel agents would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume operations. // United and People Express tried to restructure their agreement . But in its statement United said that People ' s suggestions , by including liabilities which " had the potential of increasing the purchase prices beyond the $146 million agreement , " had made the sale even less attractive to United. // People lowered the price considerably , sources close to the negotiations said , but it may have asked United to take on potentially heavy costs. // The issue that brought the deal down was a dispute between United and its pilots over how quickly Frontier ' s pilots would move up to the same pay scales as United pilots after a takeover . The sale was contingent on agreements being worked out on wages and benefits for Frontier employees . The Air Line Pilots Association was the most important of the five unions involved. // Roger Hall , the chairman of A.L.P.A. ' s United unit , said in a statement yesterday afternoon that Frontier ' s expected filing was " a tragedy that could have been avoided if United Airlines management had not stalled pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frontier ' // He said that United ' s unwillingness to negotiate seriously " has now taken the life of Frontier Airlines and the livelihood of its 4 , 700 employees. " // For Frontier , a bankruptcy filing would mark the demise of the 40-year-old carrier , which has its operations at Denver ' s Stapleton International Airport , and would bring harder times for its 4 , 700 workers . Some Frontier are likely to be absorbed by the expected expansion of United and Continental in Denver. // For People Express , a filing would mean that it will seal off a cash drain from Frontier , which ran at a rate of about $10 million a month after People acquired Frontier last November . During a reorganization , Frontier would be protected from creditors , and since the airline is not operating , its current costs are low. // The filing would also mean , however , that People will not collect about $90 million that had been due from United Airlines as part of the sale . People had been counting on building up its cash with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finance its new strategy of becoming a full-service carrier . <> <> Partial Payment Made // People Express has already collected about $58 million from United in return for some of the best assets of Frontier , including gates , landing and take-off slots , hangars and planes. // People had sought to have United carry out its original agreement . There were repeated attempts in the last few days to get the negotiations going again and to salvage some form of Frontier. // One of the latest such efforts was a meeting yesterday by 27 members of the Master Executive Council at United of the pilots ' union , union sources said . The council represents United ' s 6 , 435 pilots , who struck for 29 days last year to prevent United from gaining a two-tier pay scale under which new pilots are hired at much lower wages . United did start a two-tier pay system , but both sides agreed that a Federal mediator would decide in 1990 whether that system would become permanent . <> <> Two-Tier Scale Opposed // United ' s pilots have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become part of United , they would form a group with lower pay and set a precedent for a two-tier pay scale . The pilots ' negotiators , therefore , wanted the Frontier pilots to be raised to the pay levels of United pilots as quickly as possible. // United , on the other hand , wanted five years to elapse before the two groups achieved parity . The United pilots were afraid that such a long period would entrench the two-tier pay scale , giving United a precedent to use in contract negotiations next year. // Neither the executives of People Express nor the union leaders at Frontier had much influence in the outcome of Frontier ' s sale to United. // " We see ourselves as a tennis ball , and we are batted from one court to another and we ' re not even in the game , " said Richard C. Kardell , chairman of the Frontier merger committee , which represents most of the airline ' s major unions . <> <> Search for New Offers // According to a source involved in the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little chance for an agreement with United , there was some hope that two other airlines would buy all or part of the carrier . The source said that neither airline had made an acceptable offer. // The collapse of Frontier , which has been shut down since last Sunday , would benefit Denver ' s two remaining major carriers , United and Continental. // " They will fill the vacuum , " Robert Joedicke , an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman said in an interview . He said that the intense fare wars in Denver would moderate . Discount fares would still be available , he added , but there would be more restrictions and the number of seats sold at lower fares would be more carefully controlled. // The net effect , he said , would be that business travelers and others who can not buy tickets far in advance could expect to pay higher fares. // A failure of Frontier , however , would have wider implications as part of the trend for weaker airlines to go under or merge with a stronger carrier. // The trend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble an oligopoly where a few huge , strong carriers dominate the rest . Such a structure , he added , was not what the founders of deregulation , which went into effect in 1978 , had in mind. // " The strong are getting stronger , " he explained , " and the weak , weaker.
