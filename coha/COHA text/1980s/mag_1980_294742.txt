Richard Woodbury did not plan it that but this week 's cover story on the booming , environmentally fragile Rocky Mountain West coincides roughly with his - and TIME 'S - return to the region . Born in Manhattan , Woodbury worked for newspapers in Denver and Grand Junction , Colo. , in the 1960s . Earlier this year TIME marked the Mountain West 's growing importance by reopening its Denver news bureau after a 13-year hiatus , and by installing Woodbury as chief . He barely had a chance to unpack his skis before this week 's story propelled him on a two-week , 2,500-mile sweep across seven states from the Canadian border to New Mexico . " I had been warned that the region would be unrecognizable to me , " he says . " Things like the brown pollution cloud over Denver 's sky line , the mind-boggling traffic in Jackson Woodbury with oil Hole , the rising crime rates . But I was just as surprised by the things that had not changed : the eerie desolation of a high-country road in Wyoming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open warmth of the Westerner . I left behind me a string of meal invitations and bottomless coffee cups . " <P> Gavin Scott , TIME 'S San Francisco bureau chief , spent 17 days on the Rocky Mountain trail . He liked Boise best , he says , " mostly because of the people , who are contented but not complacent , but also for the clean air , picturesque rivers and forests . Boise residents live there not by chance but by choice . " Correspondent Michael Moritz trekked through Tucson , Santa Fe and Salt Lake City before winding up at Arco 's Black Thunder mine in Wyoming . He watched in awe as " shovels the size of freighters dumped coal into trucks the size of houses . " In Washington , D.C. , Correspondent Gary Lee interviewed Congressmen and other powerbrokers active in the frontier states . <P> The writer of the story was Jim Kelly , who spent a week driving around the Western states . A native New Yorker , Kelly dropped in on Steamboat Springs , Colo. , where he had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly unrecognizable because of all the new housing developments , " he says . " But elsewhere you can drive for hours and see hardly a soul . " Los Angeles Bureau Chief William Rademaekers , who will soon be leaving the U.S. to become senior correspondent in Europe , picked up a memento of the West 's vast distances during his many long days reporting the story : a $5 speeding ticket in Montana . The friendly patrolman told him , " If you want to drive fast , just keep $5 on your dashboard . We do n't take checks . "
