PINBALL <P> by Jerzy Kosinski Bantam ; 287 pages ; $14.95 ( hardback ) $7.95 ( paper ) <P> Of all hazardous materials handled by Jerzy Kosinski , none has been as volatile as the metaphor . Properly used , it illumined a century ; in The Painted Bird ( 1965 ) the speechless child became a great symbol of the inadequacy of language confronted by atrocity . In Being There ( 1971 ) the hero , Chance , acutely parodied the modern condition : he was a blank ; the cyclopean screen was full of ideas . <P> But in recent works , Kosinski 's metaphors have proved unstable . Life was presented , with mixed results , as a cockpit , a series of blind dates , a skirmish on a polo field . In his latest novel , existence is viewed as a pinball machine complete with odd caroms and freighted signs : BEGIN GAME . ONE TO FOUR CAN PLAY . The device obscures an intriguing notion What if America 's greatest rock star was unseen by the public , known only by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charts would be as disembodied as a ghost and as influential as a President . <P> His name is Goddard and he becomes the elusive quarry of Pinball , pursued by Domostroy , a burned-out composer whose trebles are all behind him . Like almost all Kosinski heroes , Domostroy is an adrenal wanderer , ready for any existential errand . His employer is the beautiful groupie Andrea Gwynplaine , who mails Goddard hard-core snapshots and waits for him to emerge , panting , from his lair . With Domostroy 's collaboration , she manages to run her quarry to earth . But Andrea 's success is her undoing : her purpose is not worship but murder , and Goddard 's is not obscurity but survival . <P> On the trail , exclamations detonate with the force of comic-strip balloons : " You have such light eyes and fair skin ! " " I know who you are ! " " Yes I do ! " Yet , despite these excesses , Pinball has its payoffs . Throughout his prolific career , Kosinski has been a novelist of ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept their salinity . He deftly lampoons contemporary lyrics , his scenes of the South Bronx seem torn from a Bosch triptych , and his discussions of classical music are informed with the insights of a connoisseur . <P> This has been a peculiar period for Kosinski . He is one of the best actors in Reds , and he supported and later repudiated the parole of convicted murderer Jack Henry Abbott . These excursions on nonliterary turf may have contributed to the inconsistencies of a work that , in the end , can only prompt admirers to respond : " What a premise ! " " What talent ! " " What a waste ! " <P> - By Stefan Kanfer
