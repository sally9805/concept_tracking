The premier peddler of the new machines showing up in business offices is neither IBM nor Xerox , but An Wang , 61 , a Chinese-born inventor who founded Wang Laboratories in 1951 . The Lowell , Mass. , company produces state-of-the-art equipment for the office of the future . Wang Laboratories dominates the market for so-called integrated information systems . These are elaborate combination of computerized word and data processors , high-speed printers , telecommunications hook-ins and video display terminals used by secretaries and their bosses . And such office innovations are likely to continue . Says Wang : " The cost of parts keeps getting lower , and the applications are getting wider . " <P> The son of a Shanghai English teacher , Wang came to the U.S. in 1945 to earn a Ph.D . in applied physics at Harvard . Three years later , at age 28 , he invented the magnetic core , a tiny , doughnut-shaped data storage element that remained the key to computer memory technology for more than 20 years until it was replaced by sophisticated semiconductor equipment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room above an electrical fixtures store on Boston 's Columbus Avenue . The firm engineered one-of-a-kind products to fill special customer needs . One result was the first digital scoreboard , built for the opening of New York 's Shea Stadium in 1964 . <P> In the same year the company 's reputation began to grow when it introduced one of the first desktop electronic calculators . But eight years later Texas Instruments began selling hand-held machines made with silicon chips and stole the market . Wang then quickly shifted his company 's efforts into large-scale office electronics . In 1972 the company entered the word processor market , and soon introduced the television-like screen that nearly all electronic word processing equipment now uses for displaying text . The company at present has 35% of the world market . <P> Nonstop innovation and a sales force that is among the best in the industry have kept Wang Laboratories expanding rapidly . The company has averaged a 75% annual growth in profits over the past five years , including an 82% increase in the fiscal year that ended June 30 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84% over the same period last year . <P> Further growth , though , will be more difficult . The office-of-the-future market has become so attractive that the computer giants are now aggressively going after it . IBM , for example , last summer introduced its low-priced Displaywriter that will compete with certain Wang products . <P> Wang , who has been an American citizen since 1955 , is now about to start operation in the land of his birth . He is currently negotiating with the People 's Republic of China on a joint venture to produce small computers in Nanjing . Having heard of Wang 's spectacular record , Chinese bureaucrats are already planning on $4 million to $5 million worth of production in the project 's first year , and a 60% annual growth rate thereafter .
