An episode of this genre began and ended this week with disclosures about the personal and financial troubles of the nation ' s top securities law enforcer , prompting his resignation today. // Among other things , the reports disclosed that the official , John M. Fedders , head of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission , had admitted beating his wife repeatedly , causing injuries. // Was this misconduct so serious as to warrant a resignation ? Was it news ? // In official and journalistic Washington , a strong feeling that officials as well as others should be able to live their private lives in peace is constantly tugging against a countervailing force , the strong public and journalistic interest in anything that might cast doubt on an official ' s fitness to discharge a public trust. // Most of the time , the heavy drinking of Senator so-and-so , the homosexuality of this or that member of Congress , the casual drug use or philandering or marital discord or financial wheeling and dealing of other officials , are discreetly ignored by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of dam bursts and an official finds himself or herself pinned and wriggling in the national spotlight , watching the most painful personal travails unfold on the evening news , with professional survival hanging in the balance. // Sometimes this happens because somebody whispers something into a reporter ' s ear and has evidence to back it up . Sometimes it happens because an allegation comes out on the public record in an official court or legislative proceeding. // The latter was the case with Mr. Fedders . His wife-beating and the difficult financial straits into which he fell because of a deep pay cut he took when he left private law practice to enter the Government in 1981 came into the public record through a pending divorce proceeding . He has also been mentioned for years in news reports and officially investigated , although not implicated , in connection with a reputed cover-up of a bribery scheme in which a former law client , Southland Corporation , has been charged. // The publicity about his personal affairs started Monday with a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The immediate issue for the Reagan Administration , the Securities and Exchange Commission and Mr. Fedders was whether he should continue in office once his problems had been exposed. // John S. R. Shad , chairman of the S.E.C. , said Monday that Mr. Fedders had done " an outstanding job " and that his work had not been adversely affected by his personal burdens. // A senior Reagan Administration official said today that the case was especially delicate because " it ' s something between a man and his wife " and because there was no reason to think Mr. Fedders had not done his Government job well. // " I think the President wants to be extremely careful , " the official said. // Hours later , Mr. Fedders resigned , saying his private difficulties in no way affected his job performance but that " exaggerated " and " unfair " publicity " threatens to undermine the effectiveness of the division of enforcement and of the commission. " // The basic criterion for approaching allegations of disreputable personal conduct by an official , according to Lloyd N. Cutler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " whether it went to his fitness in office or was sufficiently scandalous to affect his ability to function . " Equally important , he said , is the strength of the evidence in support of the allegation , and whether the official plausibly contests it. // But in real life this criterion leads to questions whose answers are often not self-evident. // Should a man be denied a Presidential appointment because his wife says he beat her , when he denies it ? Should a White House aide be asked to resign because the F.B.I. was told she had smoked marijuana as a college student ? Should a man who has received financial benefits from people whom he helped get Government jobs be confirmed as Attorney General ? Should a candidate for Vice President be drowned in bad publicity because of her husband ' s questionable business dealings ? // News executives also agonize over such questions when deciding whether to publish reports about the private lives of officials. // " This is the toughest call I ' ve had to make since I ' ve been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal , said today about the Fedders article. // He said he " agonized a couple of weeks , " met with a lawyer for Mr. Fedders who argued against publication and debated with other editors . The decision was especially hard , Mr. Pearlstine said , because " by all accounts he does his job well. " // " As a general rule , I don ' t think we should be writing about the private lives of public officials when there is no indication that the behavior in private is affecting their public performance , " Mr. Pearlstine said. // He said several factors had " prompted us to go against our general rule " in the Fedders case : " The facts that he is one of the most important law enforcement officials in the country , that he admitted in public the charges of wife-beating that his spouse had raised , that the White House was aware of the issue of family violence and seemed to be concerned about it , and that he had indicated that he would resign his position at the S.E.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " When you put all that together with the questions raised about his indebtedness and some of the issues raised in the Southland case , it seemed that we had to run the story , " he said . <> <> Stories That ' Must Be Printed ' // A. M. Rosenthal , executive editor of The New York Times , said : " Generally speaking , we try to avoid stories that have to do with marital problems of public officials . But sometimes these problems , or others such as alcoholism , can not and should not be avoided . That happens when they become matters of public record or when the official ' s work is seriously affected , when laws are broken or when an obvious scandal is taking place . When stories of repeated wife-beating by a public official , serious domestic financial problems and so on are known or become part of the public record , they must be printed . That was certainly the case in the unhappy case of Mr. and Mrs. Fedders. " // Benjamin C. Bradlee , executive editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a sensitive issue but I think the fact is that when the private life of a public person intrudes on his performance of his duties , it ' s news. " // Notwithstanding others ' judgments that Mr. Fedders had done his job well , Mr. Bradlee said : " The fact is that he ' s not at work , he ' s in court. " // Candidates for important Government jobs are ordinarily asked whether anything in their personal lives could be used to discredit them. // In an article two years ago , Fred F. Fielding , the White House counsel , urged applicants not to hold anything back when the question came up . It is better , he said , to deal with it " before one ' s colleagues and competitors and thousands of strangers are reading all about it in the newspaper. " //
