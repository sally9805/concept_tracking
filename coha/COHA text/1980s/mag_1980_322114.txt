" This has been-this is-an ordeal . Even after it 's over we 'll carry the worry , the fatigue and the stress inside us . But we 've learned a great deal . We 've learned fortitude and patience . " Thus Louisa Kennedy , a spokeswoman for the families of the 52 American hostages , summed up their emotions this week as their yearlong ordeal seemed to be approaching an end . " I look calm and controlled , but inside I 'm a wreck , " said Kennedy , who is the wife of Hostage Moorhead Kennedy and a founder of the Family Liaison Action Group ( FLAG ) in Washington , which has served as a clearing house , policy board and lobbyist on behalf of the hostages ' families . <P> Most of the families have tried to keep their hopes from rising too high . " It looks a little more encouraging , but we 've been through this drill before , " said Eugene Lauterbach of Dayton , the father of Hostage Steven Lauterbach . " From where I stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the country concentrated on Election Night coverage on TV , the hostages ' families were mainly attuned to the ring of phone calls from Washington . Since the Iranian parliament announced its conditions for the hostages ' release on Nov. 2 . FLAG members and volunteers have been helping keep the families apprised of the progress of negotiations with Tehran . The families , except for 15 who live in the Washington area , are scattered throughout 40 states . " For most , " said Kennedy , " the isolation is devastating . " <P> FLAG is based in the huge private conference room of Secretary of State Edmund Muskie ( who occasionally stops in to see how things are going ) . On the 30-ft. walnut table is a bank of telephones ; in cardboard boxes on the floor are stacks of mail for the hostages , of which the organization receives up to 300 pieces a week . FLAG acts as a buffer between the families and sometimes overzealous newsmen , and has successfully lobbied for passage of the Hostage Relief Act , which will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages . More recently it has taken a direct hand in efforts to break the diplomatic deadlock over the hostages . When Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Raja'i flew to New York City to address the United Nations last month , FLAG President Katherine Keough was the only American to meet with him at his Fifth Avenue residence . A high-ranking State Department official termed the meeting " a major diplomatic move . " <P> Now that the release may be imminent , FLAG is urging the families to write letters that would await the hostages in Wiesbaden , West Germany , helping them in their transition to freedom by bringing them up to date on family news and activities during the past year . In addition , looking ahead to the time when the hostages return to the U.S. , the organization has persuaded the State Department to allow the families a private reunion before staging an official public greeting in Washington . One FLAG member has noticed a distinct change this week in the kind of anxiety felt by the families : " It has changed from the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet this person ? What will he be like ? What will he think of what I 've done here ? Will he look at my news clippings and be proud of me , or disapproving ? ' "
