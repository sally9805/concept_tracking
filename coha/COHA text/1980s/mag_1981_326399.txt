Congress and the White House try to forge a tax compromise <P> On one side was President Reagan , eager to hold to his campaign pledge to cut personal income taxes across the board by 10% in each of the next three years , the so-called " 10-10-10 " proposal . On the other was House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and his fellow congressional Democrats , who favor a smaller tax cut offered for one year at a time . Like proud and coquettish students at a prom , each has been eyeing the other , hoping for an invitation to dance . Last week , with congressional Republicans acting as chaperons , they began edging toward one another in a series of private meetings-at the White House , the Treasury Department , in a Capitol hideaway-that laid the groundwork for a possible compromise tax bill . <P> Reagan came to the cotillion with an aura of invincibility from his decisive , and uncompromising , victory in paring $36 billion from the fiscal 1982 budget , which was formally approved by Congress last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less support both in Congress and throughout the country , mainly because it threatens further to bloat the federal debt and aggravate inflation . As if to dramatize such fears , the nation 's leading banks last week raised their prime lending rate to 20.5% , up 3 percentage points in one month . Moreover , last week 's report that the gross national product had surged 8.4% in the first quarter seemed to weaken the case for the economic stimulus that the Administration argues a tax cut would bring . <P> The Administration has somewhat slowed the momentum of its budget victory by pushing a hastily conceived plan to bolster the troubled Social Security system by trimming benefits-especially for those who retire at age 62 . The Senate last week issued Reagan a stinging rebuke by passing , on a 96-to-0 vote , a " sense of Congress " resolution opposing any " precipitous and unfair " reductions in benefits for early retirees and any package of cuts that is more severe than necessary to keep the system solvent in the short run . Congressman Claude Pepper of Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Schweiker , " You have chosen a solution that violates the sacred word of our President and our Government and our Congress to the people . " The White House backtracked quickly , releasing a letter from Reagan assuring congressional leaders that " this Administration is not wedded to any single solution . " Reagan called for a bipartisan effort to find a way to save the system .
