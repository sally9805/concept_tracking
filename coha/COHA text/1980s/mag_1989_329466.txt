Beginning as a tropical depression , an area of low pressure off the west coast of Africa , it whirled across the Atlantic , gathering strength from the moist tropical air , puffing itself up into a fearsome 150-m.p.h. hurricane . At week 's end Hurricane Hugo , its fury spent , whimpered out in rainfall over southern Canada . Between its gentle birth and welcome demise , Hugo carved an awesome arc of destruction in a 2,300-mile sweep from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe to the Carolinas . <P> Like a holiday cruise ship from hell , Hugo hit the major ports of call in the islands , killing at least 28 people and causing more than $2 billion in property damage . After pausing to regain its strength , it slammed into Charleston , S.C. , with 135-m.p.h. winds . Its swath embraced coastal resorts and barrier islands well into North Carolina , leveling seaside homes and leaving communities isolated and without power . Eleven people were killed , and insurance experts predicted that the covered damage costs may exceed $753 million , the record payout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bahamas , Alabama and Mississippi just two weeks after Hurricane David killed 1,200 people in the Dominican Republic , then spread destruction from Florida to Canada . Hugo was the fiercest storm to strike the U.S. East Coast since then . Last year , almost to the week , Gilbert , a maximum Category 5 hurricane with 175-m.p.h. winds , had howled along a more westerly course , pounding Jamaica before stomping into Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast . <P> Thanks to the increasing proficiency of storm forecasters and a greater readiness to heed their warnings , the loss of life inflicted by Hugo was minimal . A mass exodus from coastal areas saved countless people in the U.S. Except for a few diehards who refused to leave their low-lying homes , Hugo found few lives to endanger . <P> The hurricane 's weeklong assault began at 1 a.m. on Sunday as its 140-m.p.h. shriek shattered the sleep of the 340,000 residents and uncounted tourists on Guadeloupe . " There 's nothing left of St. Francois , " reported the resort town 's mayor , Ernest Moutoussamy . Eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hugo fell on Montserrat , an eleven-mile-wide British island of 12,000 residents . Tin roofs were ripped off houses and nearly every building sustained serious damage , leaving few inhabitants with either shelter or fresh water . The wooded mountains that had inspired visitors to call Montserrat the Emerald Isle turned brown as most of the green trees lost their tops . " It was paradise here , " said Governor Christopher Turner , who placed the damage at $100 million . " Now we 're back to the kerosene age and washing in the river . " Ten residents died . <P> Next to be mauled were other Leeward Islands . Antigua and Barbuda caught only glancing blows , but they were powerful enough to cause $37 million in damage . In St. Kitts and Nevis , more directly in the storm 's path , ham-radio operators estimated that 99% of the population of 48,000 was homeless . Damage there was put at $50 million .
