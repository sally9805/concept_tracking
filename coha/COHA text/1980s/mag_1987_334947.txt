If TV programmers were always predictable , Hill Street Blues would have had a short life as one of the medium 's more notable flops . Despite critical praise , the unorthodox police show settled near the bottom of the ratings after its January 1981 debut . But NBC renewed it anyway and then watched a remarkable success story take shape . First came a passel of Emmys ( eight after its first season , a record-breaking number for one series ; 26 all together ) , then a growing corps of dedicated viewers . People who claimed to watch little else on TV would tune in faithfully for the intricate and often explosive drama that swirled around a bustling inner-city police station . Last week , however , a closing notice went up at the station house as Hill Street Blues , after seven seasons , was canceled . <P> The move was expected . Hill Street 's ratings have been on a downward slide , and last December the series was unceremoniously evicted from its longtime Thursday-night time slot . Several cast members , including Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would leave after this season . The show 's producer , MTM Enterprises , was reluctant to continue churning out the expensive hourlong episodes ( average cost : $1.5 million ) . " There was no financial reason to go on , " says Executive Producer David Milch , " and aesthetically nothing left to prove . " <P> Few shows have proved so much . From the start , Hill Street 's gritty , teeming visual style ( created in part by shooting with hand-held cameras ) set ) it apart from anything else on TV . Its cops were not macho superheroes but flawed men and women with interesting lives both on and off the beat . The show 's dramatic structure ( copied by such successors as St. Elsewhere and L.A. Law ) was unusually complex , interweaving a dozen or so major characters and several ongoing plots each week . If the comic interludes were often heavy- handed and the drama sometimes soapy , Hill Street nevertheless defined " quality television " for much of the ' 80s and was a key building block in NBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The series survived many traumas and changes , from the death of Co-Star Michael Conrad ( who as Sergeant Phil Esterhaus opened each episode with its trademark roll call ) to the 1985 departure of Steven Bochco , the show 's co- creator , fired after reported disputes over cost overruns . Yet new characters ( like Dennis Franz 's choleric Lieut . Buntz ) and continued good scripts ( including one this season by Playwright David Mamet ) injected fresh life . " This one never went downhill , " says NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff . " It 's like a ballplayer : you want to see someone go out a winner , like Sandy Koufax , instead of dropping fly balls in left field . "
