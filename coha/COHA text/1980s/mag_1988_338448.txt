Twenty years ago , Bodrum , Turkey , seemed like a town that time had forgotten . " It was a small fishing village , " remembers Atlantic Records Chairman Ahmet Ertegun . " The main activities were fishing and sponge diving , as well as work in agriculture  --  citrus trees , olive trees . " There were a few foreigners to be found haggling over prices with merchants at the bazaar , and a handful of tourists viewing the city 's ancient ruins . <P> A visitor returning today would hardly know Bodrum . The town 's 185-slip marina is already too small for the flotilla of yachts anchored there from ports as distant as Oslo and Southampton . On the other side of the harbor , near the 15th century Crusader castle that dominates the town , about 200 gulets  --  motor-equipped sailboats built by local craftsmen  --  take tourists out for a week or a month in the unspoiled waters off Turkey 's Aegean and Mediterranean coasts . Halicarnas , an enormous open-air disco , pumps music and shoots lasers until dawn . Ertegun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. as a boy , now owns a sumptuous villa in Bodrum where he entertains such glitterati as Mick Jagger and Oscar de la Renta . <P> Bodrum is at the center of a tourism explosion that has taken Turkey by surprise . Over the past several years the country has evolved from a quiet , almost isolated land into one of the hottest tourist spots in Europe .

" It used to be an absolute backwater . Midnight Express was the only thing that people knew about the place . " ( Turkey does have stringent drug laws , and travelers caught with even one gram of hashish risk a heavy jail term . ) <P> Today 's tourists are discovering a Turkey that transcends popular stereotypes . In Istanbul they jam the Topkapi Palace to gaze at the 400-room harem of the sultanate and to view its incomparable treasury of emeralds , diamonds , gold and ivory . They pack the Blue Mosque and the other masterpieces of Mehmet Aga , Turkey 's great 17th century architect . Bargain hunters fill the cavernous covered bazaar looking for rugs , leather goods and gold . To the south , near Izmir , tour guides jockey for position at the ruins of Ephesus , where the main attraction is the Temple of Artemis , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eerie area in Central Anatolia where thousands of monks lived in conical towers of rock during the early Christian period , 22 tourist buses were recently parked together .
