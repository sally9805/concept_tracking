Jockeying for advantage is the name of the game for all the contenders <P> Only twice in the television age , 1960 and 1976 , have presidential candidates formally debated , and it is an article of political faith that in both those hairline contests the encounters may well have decided the election . With all three candidates this year having long since agreed to joust , presumably a few aides should by now , with Nov. 4 only nine weeks away , have settled the details for the great TV debates of 1980 . Quite the contrary . They are having surprising difficulties in getting the show on the road . <P> With Democrat Jimmy Carter and Republican Ronald Reagan locked in a virtual tie in the latest opinion polls , and with Independent John Anderson desperately clamoring for equal public attention , the squabbling has permutations that were not possible in the one-on-one situations of the past . Publicly , this bitter campaign within the campaign was pitched in terms of high principles . Privately , each camp was coldly determined to exploit what it saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to capitalize on the strengths of its own man . <P> Carter 's strategists were pushing hard for as many sessions as possible with Reagan and were insisting , quite stubbornly , that the first one , which all agree could be crucial in making vital impressions on viewers , should not include Anderson . Carter 's aides believe that Reagan is more likely to flub if he is matched head to head with Carter and has to face tough questioning on issues involving detailed knowledge of the Government . <P> Presidential Press Secretary Jody Powell argued for excluding Anderson from the first debate on the ground that " it 's one thing to say Anderson should be heard , but quite another to say he should be afforded the same status as the nominees of the two main parties . That 's just not defensible . " The Carter strategists do not want to cooperate in giving Anderson any wide exposure , on the well-founded theory that it would help his cause and thereby hurt the President 's more than it does Reagan 's , since lately Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Reagan ( see chart ) . But just as important , they want to establish a clear-cut first debate contrast between the President and Reagan ; Anderson 's presence , they fear , would cloud and diffuse viewer judgments on the outcome of the Carter-Reagan performances and reduce the President 's chances of scoring a clear win in the public perception . <P> The Reagan plotters , on the other hand , were fighting to give Anderson a chance to compete in the first one , al though they were willing to meet Carter alone later on . They also wanted to limit the number of debates . " Frankly , I think there ought to be two debates , " Reagan said last week , " one domestic and one on foreign policy . " Why only two ? Reagan 's chief debate negotiator , James Baker , contended that preparing for a greater number of debates in various cities would take too much time away from campaigning . Argued Baker : " We want to debate , but we do n't want to run around the country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
