Election experts say it ' s also a tug of war between traditional Democrats ( for Mondale ) and independents ( for Hart ) . // // * It ' s low-income voters ( for Mondale ) against upper-income voters ( for Hart ) . // // * It ' s older voters ( Mondale ) against younger voters ( Hart ) . // // * It ' s less-educated voters ( Mondale ) vs. college graduates ( Hart ) . // Thanks to high-speed computers and thousands of voter interviews , analysts can tell us more today about voter trends than anyone dreamed of a few years ago. // Such detail offers us valuable guides about what might happen in the next big contest - the Illinois primary on March 20. // These studies tell us , for example , that George McGovern ' s withdrawal from the race should help Senator Hart more than Mr. Mondale. // The profile of a typical McGovern voter ( young , well-educated , high-income , white-collar , politically liberal ) is exactly where Hart is drawing some of his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s powerful showing among black voters is making it a lot harder for Mondale to slow Hart ' s momentum . Hart gets few black votes . So the longer Mr. Jackson stays in the race , the better it is for the senator from Colorado. // That brings us to Illinois. // The Prairie State should be strong Mondale country . Over 40 percent of its Democratic voters are blue-collar union members . About 30 percent are black . Illinois has struggled with high unemployment and poverty - issues where Mondale is considered strong. // Yet the contest with Hart is seen as a tossup. // Part of the reason is that Hart has attracted large numbers of voters , many casting a ballot for the first time , who consider themselves only ' ' weak ' ' Democrats . He also gets the largest share of independents. // The Hart style , in fact , is ideal in an age when party loyalties have waned . Today , a candidate like Hart who shows his independence of party bosses , looks good on TV , and can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' new ideas , ' ' ' ' a new generation of leadership ' ' ) can be a real political force. // Mondale , now faced with the Hart phenomenon , will do his best to solidify his traditional Democratic support in Illinois . But just as important , he must reach out to those voters who don ' t walk the party line so closely. // Here ' s what the computer studies tell us are the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate as the primary in Illinois , the biggest industrial state yet to vote , draws near . Most of the data come from thousands of interviews with actual voters this week in Florida , Georgia , Alabama , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts . The data were compiled by two television networks , ABC and NBC , and provided to the Monitor. // The Hart-Mondale contest , in part , turns on personal characteristics . Both Hart and Mondale have certain advantages , according to the voters. // Mondale , for example , is praised for his experience . He also would probably do better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when comparing Hart and Mondale , say Mondale would probably provide somewhat stronger leadership. // Hart , however , has other perceived strengths which often outweigh those for Mondale. // By and large , the most important thing the voters are looking for this year is a candidate who will ' ' bring needed change. ' ' // Most Democrats , by a wide margin , think Hart would be far more likely to bring fresh ideas and programs into the federal government. // Hart also is seen as more independent , and somewhat more likely to ' ' get things done , ' ' once he got to the White House. // Each man , therefore , has his own personal strengths . In brief , it comes down to a choice between experience ( Mondale ) and change ( Hart ) for most voters. // There is no single issue that dominates this campaign . Voters mention foreign affairs , poverty , the federal deficit , red tape , threat of war , taxes , and others. // Mondale and Hart again each have their strengths . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy , Mondale a little better on foreign affairs. // There are exceptions to that general conclusion , however . Hart , for example , gets higher marks on the nuclear-freeze issue , while Mondale is judged to be more interested in helping the needy. // One of Hart ' s great advantages in this campaign has been his appeal across the political spectrum . In Massachusetts , for example , Hart got the votes of liberals ( 39 percent ) , moderates ( 45 percent ) , and conservatives ( 46 percent ) . // Hart managed this wide support even though he ' s generally regarded as a liberal senator . One reason may be that the senator still is not very well known . But he has also been careful not to offend any major ideological bloc. // By contrast , Mondale ' s views as a liberal are widely understood . And you can see the results in the voter surveys . He ' s strong , as might be expected , with liberals . But among conservatives , he ' s usually much weaker. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : // // * Religion doesn ' t seem to be influencing the choice between Hart and Mondale . Voters who think abortion is a key issue split evenly between the two men. // // * Men and women are voting almost identically . Hart made a special appeal to women voters earlier in the campaign , but men seem to like him just as much. // // * Age is a real factor among voters . Mondale is at his worst with voters under 40 . Hart drops off with voters over 60 . But as the contest continues , Hart is gaining strength with older voters. // // * Education is one of the great dividers . Among those with less than a high school education , Mondale runs away with the race . Hart ' s at his best with people who attended college , though his supports drops slightly with those who did graduate studies. // // * Race also is a key indicator . Mondale gets several times as many black votes as Hart. // // * Party loyalty is another determinant . In Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Tuesday . But among those who consider themselves ' ' strong ' ' Democrats , Mondale came out on top . It was independents and self-styled ' ' weak ' ' Democrats who gave Hart his edge. // // * Occupations also are important . Hart does well with white-collar workers , professionals , and managers . Mondale is at his best with blue-collar workers , housewives , and retired people. // Finally , John Glenn ' s future plans may have a major impact on this race . He has called a press conference for today to reveal his plans. // Already , Senator Glenn has closed his campaign offices in New York , Alaska , and Kansas . He has fallen $2. 5 million into debt. // If Senator Glenn steps out , it will be another boost for Hart . Glenn ' s support comes heavily from upper- and middle-income , well-educated , independent-minded people - just the kind who seem to like Hart ' s style. // //                   @ @
