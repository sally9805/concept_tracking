The Vatican does not ordinarily concern itself with the precise living arrangements of 14 nuns . But the controversy that erupted this year over a small Carmelite convent on the edge of Poland 's Auschwitz death camp had threatened to bring an end to a chapter of ecumenism , initiated by the Catholic Church two decades ago , with Judaism . The presence of the five-year- old cloister struck Jews and even some Catholics as an insensitive intrusion into a setting that will forever symbolize the Holocaust ; 4 million people died there , an estimated 2.5 million of them Jews . Last week , after repeatedly dismissing the issue as a local matter , the Holy See finally % intervened to express its strong support for relocating the convent . <P> A panel of four Cardinals and representatives of Jewish organizations agreed in 1987 to move the nuns into an interfaith prayer center outside the death camp . But no new facility was built . After Jews demonstrated at the convent in July , Poland 's Primate , Jozef Cardinal Glemp , retaliated with criticism that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the 1987 agreement should be renegotiated . <P> The Vatican did not directly order Glemp to start work on the prayer center , but the statement issued by the Commission for Religious Relations with Judaism declared that such a facility would " contribute in an important way " to good relations between Catholics and Jews . Moreover , it said , " the Holy See is prepared to contribute its own financial support . " While the statement was carefully worded to preserve local authority , it was an indication that Pope John Paul II , himself a Pole , had finally decided to step in . Said a Vatican official : " He did n't write it , but he approved it with great satisfaction . " <P> At first it appeared that Glemp might defy Rome 's wishes . He told reporters that it sounded like " a forced resolution , and I do n't think that would be a very positive way . " Two days later , however , the Cardinal signed a letter to Sir Sigmund Sternberg , chairman of the International Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but promising to reinstate the 1987 agreement . " It is essential not only to move the convent outside the perimeter of the site , but also to set up the new ( ( interfaith ) ) cultural center , " said Glemp . " This will help us to continue the dialogue that is so dear to us . " Timing and other details were left fuzzy , but the festering Auschwitz dispute was apparently settled , for the second time .
