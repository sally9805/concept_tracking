The bizarre circumstances of this stage-door presidential campaign conspired to make Tuesday 's television drama a climactic , winner-take-all event . <P> It is not only silly , it is dangerous . But the candidates themselves declared it would be vital-and the pollsters , and the journalists . No wonder Americans began to believe the reviews of how they were expected to respond . To hear some tell it , they were planning to pull up around the television set as if it were Oscar night in Hollywood and measure teeth , hair , voices , eyes and shapes , thus resolving months of indecision by observing 90 minutes of two-dimensional posturing . <P> It could work that way . The so-called debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan may be terribly influential in deciding the final vote , but , in truth , it is of marginal value in providing information for anyone to assess realistically the skills and intelligence needed by a President . Reagan hoped to demonstrate his heft and grasp of the issues , and Carter declared he would show everybody that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards if he faces Brezhnev in another round of negotiations . <P> In fact , if Reagan believed that in a weekend of cramming for the debate he could add to his presidential dimensions , he is more shallow than now perceived by many . And if Carter really negotiated with Brezhnev or anyone else without prepared position papers on the table in front of him or in the briefcases of his aides , he would be more reckless and naive than even his detractors have imagined . <P> There is some worth in having a President who is articulate under pressure , well funded with instantly retrievable facts and unawed by the stature of his adversary . But those skills form only a small part of the abilities a President needs to run the nation . <P> Presidential debates compel both men to gloss over their miscalculations , exaggerate their strengths , try to lure the other one into error , in order to emerge in the eyes of the public at large as a " winner . " All of these objectives so coveted in television performances are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic negotiation . <P> Success in the Oval Office requires that mistakes be acknowledged and corrected , that communication be direct and candid , both internally and with outside adversaries . In this time of penetrating surveillance and instant communication , the old art of bluffing and posturing is often foolish and hazardous . We know each other 's capabilities . Thus clear understanding of purposes is essential . It is a basic rule of today 's diplomacy that successful negotiations never produce " winners " in the television sense , only satisfied parties on both sides of the table . Threats hurled back and forth are a sign of failed leadership . <P> The 1976 Ford-Carter encounters are an example of how this electronic drama can obscure meaning and mislead audiences . Carter at first was awed facing a President . But his grasp of facts and his spiritual armor were enough to restore confidence , while Ford bumbled along and made his startling claim that Poland was not under Soviet dominance . In those swift television rounds , Challenger Carter skillfully danced , jabbed and flicked his facts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision .
