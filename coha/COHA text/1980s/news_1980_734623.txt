txt Chicano Tribune Press Service WASHINGTON  --  Rep. John B. Anderson of Illinois announced Thursday that he will run for President as an independent and said he hopes to win by bringing out nonvoters . At the same time Anderson tormaiiy dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination in which he had failed to win any primaries but said he will continue his 30-year membership In the party . He said he was running as an Independent in an " effort to broaden the choice available to millions of potential voters who simply do not participate " in the party political process . the WHITE-HAIRED veteran con-pressman from Rockford , accompanied by his wife Keke and three of their five children , - made his announcement at a National Press Club news conference jammed with several hundred cheering supporters . He emphasized that he was not launching a new third party and strongly disputed Republican and Democratic contentions that his independent candidacy " places me in the role of a so-called spoiler . " " It does not spoil the political process when I seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , and even now , consider our democratic system irrelevant to their lives , " Anderson said . HE CITED public opinion polls showing that " virtually one-half of potential voters " are dissatisfied with the prospect of a choice between President Carter and Ronald Reagan , the frontrunners for the nominations . He also cited statistics showing that only 53 per cent of eligible voters east ballots for President in 1976 . Anderson said " it seems likely that voter apathy will increase " unless there is an alternative to Carter or Reaganthis year . And apathy and " growing disaffection with the political process " pose a far greater threat to the stability of our democratic institutions than what some are sure to charge is an oblique , perhaps frontal attack on the two-party system . " IN RESPONSE to questions , Anderson said he was " not discouraged " by his failure to win any of the six Republican primaries he ran in . Only a " tiny fraction " of eligible voters participated in those , he said , and his new independent candidacy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political process . " At the same time Anderson left himself an out in case his new candidacy never gets off the ground . He acknowledged there are major legal obstacles to getting on the ballot al an independent in some states and said he has authorized an " exploratory group " to look into whether he can gather the financial and political support necessary to make a plausible campaign . HE WILL STAY In the race only if he is convinced that he will be a " realistic candidate " with a chance to win , he said . Anderson said it would be " inappropriate " and " premature " to offer anyone the spot as his vice presidential running mate but that when the time comes he will consider both men and women , Democrats , Republicans , and independents , for that role , Under public financing laws . the two major party candidates will each have about $29 million to spend on the campaign . Anderson said that , as a " ballpark figure , " he believed he might be able to mount a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He will not be eligible for federal funds .
