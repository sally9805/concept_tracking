Ah , to be a freshman again . An entire year with nothing to do except sample the privileges of being an adult without the responsibilities . A chance to major in chemistry but dabble in art history , to try out for intramural water polo , to sing Cole Porter fight songs at the football game , to meet the diverse and intriguing group of people that high school and summer camp never quite delivered . Frat parties , water fights and spring in Daytona Beach . Through that gauzy nostalgic haze , many college graduates remember all the glories of freshman year , and problems no more weighty than getting up for an 8:30 class , doing their own laundry and trying to identify the meat at dinner . <P> This year , however , as the class of 1992 flocks to college campuses , some hard adult choices are mixed in with all the pleasures and opportunities . In an age of $18,000-a-year college bills , many students feel pressured from the start to select a major that is not only meaningful but also marketable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as early morning classes and late-night study sessions . Alcohol and drugs remain an omnipresent lure and danger made more enticing than ever as stress levels soar . And the challenge of dating in the safe-sex era has shadowed even the illusion of a lighthearted passage to adulthood . <P> The graduates of the ' 90s promise to be a different breed from the carefree cutups of the ' 50s , the earnest rebels of the late ' 60s or even the button- down bankers-to-be of the ' 80s . " They 're coming to us a lot tougher and less innocent than previous generations , " says Marilyn Katz , dean of studies and student life at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville , N.Y . " They 're not wrapped in as much cotton batting . " At the University of Southern California , Economics Professor Kenneth Taylor is concerned that today 's students are overwhelmed by " more choices than they have ever had in the past . Students are expected to determine their life-style at a very young age . " <P> The class of 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with challenges of the next few months  --  some of them familiar , but others new and unexpected . Homesickness , for example , has always played a part in the adjustment process , but for the growing number of freshmen whose families have been torn by separations or divorces , moving away may be particularly painful . Children in such families are often cast as comforters , confidants and caretakers of their parents as well as of their siblings . " Many of them feel really responsible for their parents , " says Katz , " which makes the whole separation issue much harder . " <P> For other new students , the greatest challenge is simply getting used to the independence that gleamed so brightly in the distance while they were in high school . " Being an adult all of a sudden was hard , " recalls Harvard Sophomore Jonathan Cohn , 18 , " balancing my own checkbook , making my own plane reservations . " Some students struggle for the first time with managing their money . Others , like Craig Rich , a theater major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the hardest things was waking up in the morning . You did n't have Mom there banging on the door . "
