How can such conflicting perspectives be reconciled ? Part of the answer lies in US support for Britain in its war of 1982 over the Malvinas ( Falkland ) Islands , a war in which US national interests forced the US to side with its NATO ally . Many Argentines still feel betrayed by that stance . They remember that Argentine military advisers had worked alongside American advisers in Central America , and they have watched Queen Elizabeth II knight former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger for his support of British interests. // // But the causes of anti-Americanism are far deeper than the US position on the Malvinas . Although there is great admiration for the music , the films , and the popular culture of the US , Argentines remain remote and resentful of various policies of the US government . Their values are far more like those of Spain and Italy , the countries from which most Argentine immigrants originally came , than like those of North Americans . In microcosm , Argentina represents many of the problems in projecting US influence abroad at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing a historic opportunity to assist Argentines in their struggle for a higher standard of living and the establishment of an enduring democracy . It is not a fault of will on the part of North Americans - either those in public office or in the private sector - so much as it is a failure to understand , to sympathize , to look for a moment at bilateral relations from the standpoint of those overseas . With marginally more resources , and especially with more genuine concern , the US could reverse the trend of anti-Americanism . More important , the common objectives for which many of the best Argentines and North Americans now separately stand could be advanced together. // Survey data collected in Argentina this month show that anti-Americanism is greatest among the least educated and most poor . Also , Argentines on the extreme left and the extreme right are highly critical of the US ; some intellectuals on both extremes maintain the fiction that a ' ' national-security state ' ' continues in Argentina and that the US , and especially the Pentagon , have vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . During the years of recent military control ( 1976-82 ) , the United States withdrew much of its professional contact with the Argentine military . Now US officers and the US government have virtually no contact with middle-level military personnel in Argentina . The Argentine military has always acted autonomously , in terms of its perception of Argentine interests and the interests of the armed forces , but now it operates with even less professional contact with its North American counterpart. // Another reason for lessened US influence has been the diminished role of the US Information Service . Until the late 1970s , the USIS maintained significant regional offices in Cordoba , Rosario , and Mendoza . After the Montoneros kidnapped and nearly killed the USIS branch director in Cordoba in 1976 , however , these offices were closed , because American personnel could not be protected . In the early 1980s , when the Montoneros were no longer a threat , the restraints of budget cuts and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation have made it impossible to reopen the USIS offices. // In a country of strong regional loyalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy . Personnel in the Buenos Aires embassy are frequently asked , ' ' When will the US take Cordoba or Mendoza seriously ? ' ' To cordobeses or mendocinos it is meaningless to answer in terms of the constraints of internal US politics. // Another US failure has been in higher education . Despite the general rise in anti-Americanism , more and more Argentines now want to study in the US . Through scholarships and fellowships , North American universities could further Argentine research capabilities far more than they have done so far . They have unfortunately lacked any will or impetus to do so. // One notable exception has been the program in Argentine studies at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst . Led by the energy of chancellor Joseph Duffy , the program has counted on the assistance of historian Robert Potash , whose writing on the Argentine military is widely acclaimed . Mr. Potash writes regularly for La Nacion in Buenos Aires , an honor and opportunity accorded no other North American . President Raul Alfonsin came to Amherst to receive an honorary doctorate . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the impending retirement of Potash , however , the effort may flounder unless a consensus develops at the University of Massachusetts on the importance of Argentina and Argentine studies. // More broadly , what can the US do to assist Argentine democracy and economic growth ? First , in its public policies , the US can give bilateral relations with Argentina the importance they deserve . Above all , this means working out compromise solutions on the Argentine public debt , which now saps the export surplus and the public funds that Argentina needs to promote growth at home . Effective action on the debt issue would be the most concrete means to show , as Ambassador Theodore Gildred has articulated so well in Buenos Aires , the concern of the US to fortify Argentine democracy. // Second , North Americans need to learn more about Argentina . Many still think in terms of the Dirty War of the 1970s or the epithets of ' ' fascism ' ' sometimes hurled at the Peronists . If , as now seems likely , a Peronist candidate wins the presidency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the realities rather than the stereotypes of the Peronist movement. // Finally , universities in the US have a historic responsibility when it comes to Argentina . When one enters the home of President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in Belgrano , the first item on view is his huge blue and yellow flag from the University of Michigan . Mr. Sarmiento , a personal friend of Horace Mann , brought dozens of North American teachers to Argentina in the 1780s ; some older Argentine intellectuals today still recount the stories of those who were taught by these immigrant idealists . In a hundred years , will a future generation of Argentines and Americans continue to share ideals in common ? // //
