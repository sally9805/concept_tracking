Anybody who has ever kept tropical fish knows that if you take them out of one tank and dump them in another without carefully balancing the temperature , acidity and salinity , they will languish and die . Boston Mayor Kevin White has never had the patience to acclimate his legislative proposals before he turns them loose in the State House and consequently most of them become sick and , like mishandled fish , lose their fins , drop their scales and otherwise give rise to fears that they are candidates for flushing down the toilet . That is what happened to the $75 million Boston Financial Plan . Right from the start , the package , called the Tregor bill for short in honor of the victorious plaintiff who sued the city because of overassessed commercial property , was in trouble on Beacon Hill . It was taken from City Hall , where for months the mayor and city council had haggled over it and where bankers massaged it to make it more palatable to the fussiest tax-free bond buyers , and tossed it , cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set upon it like piranhas.The view from the Hill A good many of the 18 Boston members of the House view themseves as the " real " city council , claiming they are the only elected group representative of all the neighborhoods of Boston . Their interest lies not so much in running the city , however , but in delivering services and jobs for their constituents . The Boston members of the House are a parochial lot , highly jealous of Kevin White ' s ability to deliver the same goods and thereby diminish their political clout in the precincts . The constituents in their districts are the Boston delegation ' s only lifeline to electoral office . The mayor , ensconsed in splendor in City Hall and surrounded by retainers , not only has access to their constituents , he also has an elite constituency of big name bankers , industrialists , developers and other prominent private and public citizens . Most of the Boston legislators , except for the times when they are benefiting from his blessings , are convinced that the mayor cares more about his high-placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not flawlessly crafted to care for the needs of the people who buy and sell bonds . All of the Tregor particulars - the management reforms , the tighter budget controls , the new revenue sources - were designed with the coupon clippers uppermost in mind . At least that is the way the Boston legislators see it . Rep. Kevin Fitzgerald , a young man unscathed by the world beyond Mission Hill , put it directly to an investment banker from Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Market Group , the firm that underwrites the city ' s bonds . " You ' ve take care of your bond buyers in writing this bill , you ' ve protected their future , " he said . " The mayor respectss your opinion . Will you stand behind us if we try to put the same kind of protection and comfort in writing to guarantee the essential services of fire and police protection for our constituents ? " The banker hemmed and hawed and said that he could understand where Fitz was coming from ( well , he didn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped ) , but in the end , he admitted that putting such a minimum service level guarantee in writing in the bond bill itself just might make it harder to sell the bonds . Municipal bond buyers don ' t like having anything between them and their yield , certainly not the prospect of paying for essential services to citizens.Their priorities are different The banker , Jean Rousseau of Merrill Lynch ' s public finance group , evenwent so far as to say that , strictly from an investment perspective , questions like the numbers of police and firemen available to the city were not at the top of the list . That Fitzgerald did not stalk from the room perhaps means that he was suffering from an acute attack of mellowness that morning . It is a perfect illustration of the kind of difference in water temperature between City Hall and the State House that the mayor did not try to balance soon enough with the Tregor bill . At least Boston legislators and the mayor have a common goal in mind , however - keeping Boston from going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have , now that sweetness and harmony is surfacing between Kevin and the Boston 18 , is the suspicion from the suburbs and beyond . The mayor is relying on the traditional home-rule courtesies in the House and Senate to whisk Tregor through . They don ' t apply to Boston in this case . " People from the country out my way think it is bad enough if a piece of legislation comes through with White ' s name on it , " said Walter Bickford ( D- Berlin ) . " But when once comes along from both White and the Boston City Council . . . " " There is no reason - none - that I can think of to vote for this bill to bail out Boston and it would give me personal pleasure to vote against it , " said Rep. Robert Cerasoli ( D-Quincy ) . Tregor bonding authority is probably going to ultimately be approved by the Legislature in some form . The question is how soon ? " We will have to slow it down to get the answers we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is to speedy legislation what Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson was to the Army of the Potomac at Bull Run . " The Boston reps may be getting the answers they want , but we have lots of questions . " The Boston Financial Plan is still in the swim , but it is in for a lot of pain before it is acclimatized enough to survive .
