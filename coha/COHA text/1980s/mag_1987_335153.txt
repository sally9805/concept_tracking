To the Editors : <P> U2 is the most important band in the world ( ( MUSIC , April 27 ) ) . With their songs , these musicians convey a sense of justice and evoke a wholesome feeling in the hearts and minds of their listeners . <P> Edward J. Barfield <P> Hazelwood , Mo . <P> The music of U2 embodies a trend that differs markedly from the mood of the songs of the 1960s . Although philanthropy remains the general theme of the lyrics , the composers have abandoned their anti-Establishment tone and given way to a more humanitarian sentiment . Hunger , war and apathy are out ; food , peace and empathy are in . <P> Edward C. Henschel <P> West Hyannisport , Mass . <P> Is your writer serious about U2 's social statements ? Can he really hear the " moral imperatives " above the turbid screaming and screeching ? Great musicians have made political statements with their music , which was not stylized through the gimmickry of electronics . <P> Emil Agosta <P> Weaverville , N.C. <P> At last adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups are trying to show us . U2 reaches its audience in a way that no organized church can ever hope to achieve . <P> Linda Kennedy <P> Perkiomenville , Pa . <P> While many people are into U2 for " deep and meaningful " reasons , most of us just love the sound and the words . Frankly , I am tired of incomprehensible lyrics that end with " oooh , baby . " U2 does not insult our intelligence . The band 's music makes the hair on my neck stand up and my brain work . That is the best of both worlds , would n't you say ? <P> Pauline Belleville <P> Burbank , Calif.
