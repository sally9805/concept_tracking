NBC 's Judy Woodruff wants , and gets , out of the White House <P> Judy Woodruff leads one of the most glamorous lives in Washington . As a White House correspondent for NBC television , she has waltzed at state dinners , traveled with Presidents to New Delhi and Versailles . Acclaim has gilded every aspect of her life . Like many working mothers , Woodruff , 35 , brought her infant son Jeffrey to the office one day ; unlike other mothers , she was summoned to see President Reagan , who spent ten minutes bouncing the baby and chanting nursery rhymes . <P> Yet when excitement settles into a familiar routine , even the most thrilling assignment becomes just a job . The White House beat , for all its glories , is often repetitive and tedious , the equivalent of covering a fenced-off headquarters in a company town . Says Woodruff : " Access is very tightly controlled ; inevitably , you are manipulated . You rarely see your sources . You wait for them to return phone calls . " Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up her coveted job to become a Washington-based reporter and interviewer for the morning news show Today . <P> To most of the public , and probably to many of her colleagues , Woodruff took a big step down . But as she contends in her newly published autobiography , " This Is Judy Woodruff at the White House " ( Addison-Wesley ; $12.95 ) , covering her beat can be a stunted form of journalism . For a TV network reporter , who needs to worry about pictures at the expense of time for briefing and nuance , the problems are especially acute . Woodruff particularly chafed at " staging stakeouts along the White House driveway in boiling heat or pouring rain or sub-zero dawn , never knowing when a news subject is going to leave , or by what exit , or if you catch him , whether he will have anything to say . " <P> Even worse were the hours spent following Presidents Carter and Reagan to functions devoid of news value , just in case something catastrophic might happen . Says Woodruff : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . ' " When a crisis actually erupted , Woodruff was sometimes turned into a sort of impromptu anchor , transmitting information from other NBC reporters rather than going after it . Although she was an eyewitness to the attempted assassination of President Reagan , once she had scrambled back to the White House she spent most of the rest of the afternoon rooted to one spot , facing a camera , while fellow correspondents carrying updated information " shuttled between my chair and the press office . " <P> That kind of " reporting " often prompts print reporters to dismiss their broadcast colleagues as " talking hairdos . " Admits Woodruff , who zoomed up in eight years from cleaning film and clipping articles at an Atlanta TV station to covering the President : " From my first reporting job on , I found people were not inclined to take me seriously because I was a woman and because I had never worked for a newspaper . " A senior White House aide describes Woodruff as " always a lady , " not necessarily regarding that as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story , almost timid . "
