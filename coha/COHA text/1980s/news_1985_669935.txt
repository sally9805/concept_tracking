NEW YORK  --  Bond prices climbed yesterday , extending a rally that began Tuesday after Paul Volcker , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , indicated concern that the economic expansion might fade . Prices of some U.S. Treasury bonds rose by about half a point , or $5 for each $1 , 000 face amount of securities . That rise came on top of Tuesday ' s surge of about a point . Traders read Mr. Volcker ' s remarks as meaning the Fed isn ' t likely to tighten credit conditions soon . Until recently , many analysts had worried that the Fed would tighten credit and push interest rates higher in an effort to slow the rapid growth of the nation ' s money supply . Still , some analysts predict that optimism about Fed credit policy will evaporate soon . The rally in the bond markets will be " short-lived , " said John Doyle , a vice president and financial economist at Money Market Services Inc . , Belmont , Calif . He contended that the economy is picking up steam and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit growth will reemerge " shortly . " We think the Fed will tighten credit policy by late May or early June , " Mr. Doyle said . The interest rate on federal funds , which has averaged about 8 1/2% in recent weeks , will rise to about 9 1/8% by midyear , he predicted . The rate , which is the fee banks charge each other on loans of reserves , strongly influences other interest rates . Mr. Volcker , in a speech Tuesday , said he is disturbed at the sluggish performance of the manufacturing , mining and agricultural sectors of the economy . These areas have been especially hard hit by the strength of the U.S. dollar in foreign-exchange trading . While consumer spending has been robust , much of it has been for foreign goods that have enjoyed a price advantage over U.S. products because of the dollar ' s strength . The economy will show " moderate " growth this year despite " the drag of a large volume of imports , " predicted Lewis T. Preston , chairman of J.P. Morgan &; Co . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he emphasized that " the key to getting interest rates down lies in scaling back the massive federal deficits . " A " credible attack " on the budget deficit is " vital . " That , he added , is " the only way that interest rates will come down . " There has been a " marked unevenness about this economic cycle , " Mr. Preston said . " Important sectors of the economy have not shared in the general prosperity . " He said the banking industry and its customers " have problems . " But he contended that there is " solid reason for feeling encouraged about the capacity of the financial system to ride through this difficult phase and to do so without severe disruption . " The Federal Reserve this afternoon is scheduled to release money supply figures for the week ended April 1 as well as for the month of March . Analysts generally expect the figures to show the growth of the various measures slowed sharply last month . But Mr. Doyle of Money Market Services argued that the apparent sluggishness in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays at the Internal Revenue Service in sending out income-tax refund checks . The median estimate of 45 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services calls for a $1. 7 billion rise in M1 , the basic money measure , for the week ended April 1 . This would imply an annual growth rate of only 5. 3% in M1 during March , according to Mr. Doyle . In the preceeding three months , M1 expanded at an 11. 2% clip . The Fed is seeking 4% to 7% growth this year in M1 , which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public .
