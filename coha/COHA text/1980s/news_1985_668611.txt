The soft side of Livingstone Bramble , the Rastafarian who took away Ray " Boom Boom " Mancini ' s lightweight fist-fighting title by pounding Mancini ' s face into sausage last summer , is that Bramble loves pets . Bramble won ' t go anywhere without his animal friends and insists on even bringing them with him to work . Think of the guilt you have felt when leaving home to the sounds of Bowser whining on the other side of the door . Bramble would never be so heartless . He has brought many of his household favorites with him from his home in New Jersey . And the hotel where he is living and training couldn ' t be nicer about it , though it usually discourages anything but casino pigeons . It is not uncommon for Bramble to sign autographs while one of his adoring little pals nuzzles his neck , and he often will park one of them in the corner of the ring while he spars for his rematch with Mancini , or maybe hang it over the top rope . Wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pets is a treasure to see , and infinitely more urgent than his concern for the health of Mr. Mancini , whom he has taken to calling " Boy-cini " and whom he promises to rehumiliate here Saturday for cable television . Two of Bramble ' s constant companions are Turtle and Dog , the first of which is a 7-foot python and the second a 5 1/2-foot boa constrictor , neither of which will eat anything that isn ' t alive . Feeding time is Bramble ' s favorite part of the day . Why they are called Turtle and Dog is not quite clear , except that Bramble ' s favorite pet is called Snake , and he had the name first , even though Snake is a serious pit bull terrier that once bit the head off a friendly poodle . Or so the story goes . Bramble likes Snake so much that he has taken on the nickname of Pit Bull himself , proving that he is generous and ecumenical when sorting out all of God ' s creatures , be they large , small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be grateful that it was not Bramble ' s job to name all animals in the first place , otherwise we might be calling a cockroach a sparrow , a vulture a lamb , and have no idea what to call lawyers . Part of Bramble ' s warm-up ritual is to chase a chicken while Turtle and Dog watch with interest , but Bramble never catches the chicken . It is just his way of keeping each of them in shape , like doing roadwork with a friend . There has been no talk that Bramble ' s unique method of exercise will be made into a video cassette , but the possibilities are intriguing : " Now on tape . In the privacy of your own living room . Trim down , firm up and stay fit by chasing your dinner around the house "  --  boiled , not fried , of course . It has been said that animal lovers tend to take on the characteristics of their pets . Bramble will not dispute this theory . " When I fight , I shoot out my jab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Just like my snakes when they ' re going after a rat . " When I get somebody in trouble , I just keep pouring it on , using my killer instinct , just like my pit bulls if they were in a fight to the death . " How , then , can anyone who is so in touch with the harmony of nature be judged harshly , even if Bramble did beat up everybody ' s boy next door , which is what Mancini was to us all , although I can not think of any kid on my block who ever killed a foreigner with his fists , as Mancini did . At least not in public . Bramble has yet to be widely accepted as champion . His victory over Mancini was decisive and undisputed , even if it was only the second main event Bramble had ever fought . He has fought 24 times since leaving his home in the Virgin Islands six years ago , losing once and drawing once . Bramble oftens fights with the wrong hand from the wrong stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets by on tenacity as much as skill , and the same could be said of Mancini . He has a 9-inch reach advantage on Mancini , 74 to 65 , and one year of age , 24 to 23 . But , mostly , Bramble has weirdness . Mancini confessed to being shaken up by Bramble ' s sense of mischief before the first fight . Bramble kept calling Mancini a murderer for the ring death of Korean Duk Koo Kim , not something Mancini was anxious to remember , and Bramble is not exactly the kind of guy Mancini was used to running into at the neighborhood pool hall . Bramble does not wear the dreadnoughts of the Rastafarian religion , but he does wear his hair in corn rows , as well as the occasional snake around his neck . Mancini ' s people last week wanted to make sure that Bramble ' s braided corn rows were not an unauthorized weapon and requested the Nevada boxing authories to check them out . An official dutifully went to Bramble ' s camp and insisted that Bramble rub his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscarred , the official proclaimed that Bramble ' s hair was soft enough to be admitted to the ring , though both snakes have to be left in the room or pay their own way to ringside . Thirty seats ought to be enough . CAPTION : PHOTO : Livingstone Bramble . Illustration PHOTO <>
