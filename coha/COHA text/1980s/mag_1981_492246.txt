// " TAKING " IT EASY The annual " take " of $100 billion from crime of all kinds makes still another victim of the phrase ' crime does n't pay . " by David Harrop That superstar of criminals , Al Capone , was estimated to have grossed over $100 million during the Prohibition year of 1927 from his various illegal undertakings : production and sale of liquor , gambling establishments , dog tracks , " protection " rackets , extortion , prostitution and so forth . Even if the figure is exaggerated and the overhead ( including the cost of labor ) was high , it still makes Capone one of the great earners of all time and worth more than a whole league of professional basketball players . It also indicates the earnings potential that has existed for criminals in America 's past . Today the potential is higher still and growing all the time . The annual " take " from crime of all kinds is over $100 billion . More than one-third of this money stems from ordinary crimes against business . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad checks , credit card fraud and arson account for as much as $35 to $40 billion a year . The victims of these crimes suffer in roughly the following proportions : retailing 35 percent , services 25 percent , wholesale and manufacturing about 20 percent , transportation 10 percent and arson victims 10 percent . Another $50 billion or more in criminal profits are derived from major crimes , including illegal gambling , narcotics , loan sharking , hijacking and assorted other vices . These activities are usually associated with organized crime , but obviously , independent operators take a good share of the action and income . Independent entrepreneurs are even more in evidence in personal crimes involving what might be described as " gainful sin , " that is , prostitution , pornography and other types of sexual exploitation for money . Although highly publicized and profitable in individual cases , crimes against people for gains , such as kidnapping , blackmail , hostage taking and murder for money , are actually a minor factor in the total crime take . . Crime is very big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " career criminals. - They have a large and diversified range of enterprises in which to engage , and the turnover in some of them is staggering . During 1978 , between $75 and $85 billion changed hands in illegal gambling , from numbers rackets to bets on professional football and other popular sports aside from horse racing . The profits from such transactions are very high and naturally not declared or subjected to taxation . The Internal Revenue Service , however , estimates that about $800,000 per hour is bet in the United States , and other sources put the amount of net profit from illegal betting over $12 billion a year . This is a much higher percentage of profit out of total revenue than that of the great majority of legitimate businesses in the country . Illegal gambling is the largest single source of criminal income , but other crimes are also increasing , although they still have a less impressive profit margin . Arson , in particular , has grown at a rapid rate in recent years , with losses in arson-caused fires rising from about $74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and related losses in 1978 . Fires intentionally set to collect insurance have become a major threat to the insurance industry . Robberies , burglaries and larcenies are also rising at a brisk pace . In 1975 , 4,180 banks were reportedly held up ; in that year , bank robbers made off with about $25 million in cash and negotiable securities . In 1979 , there was a much publicized wave of bank robberies that increased the amount of money stolen to nearly $40 million . According to the FBI , the average " take- from a bank robbery is $4,000 , compared to $400 for other armed robberies . Reports of all types of property theft , including automobiles , went from 719,000 in 1957 ' to 4.8 million in 1979 . One category of property crime , shoplifting , accounted for nearly $8 billion in losses to retail stores of all types in 1978 . Professional shoplifters sometimes turn over their stolen goods to fences for about 25 percent of the actual value . At other times they return the merchandise to the very stores from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of professional shoplifting is , ironically , instituting civil lawsuits against stores for false arrest . Damage settlements from such suits can be sizable . Careful studies of shoplifting in the past decade show that a highly skilled and experienced practitioner could average about $30,000 in 1971 and about $53,000 a year in 1978 . These figures , as well as all other crime income statistics , are by nature only informed estimates . Reliable figures are difficult and sometimes impossible to obtain . Both criminals and law enforcement authorities exaggerate their estimates  --  the criminals generally down-playing success to avoid more attention , the lawmen inflating it to dramatize the problems they are facing . Income estimates are likely to be more accurate for individual criminals than they are for large organizedgroups . In fact , reports on the wealth and profits of " the mob " vary so much as to be of little help . For example , the recent mob superstar Meyer Lansky is credited with running a crime empire that has gained him a personal worth variously estimated at figures between $150 million and $300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great , it is better to discuss crime profits on a more modest , manageable level both for major offenses and for commercial vice . ? Illegal Gambling . The day-to-day core facet of illegal gambling is the unglamorous but extremely pervasive numbers racket . This racket grosses an estimated $14 to $15 billion a year with a total profit margin of about 40 percent , before and after taxes of course . It has been estimated that almost 60 percent of all adults living in the inner city play the numbers at least occasionally . The numbers runner is the low but indispensable man in this business . His job is to accept bets in homes , bars , pool halls , barber shops , work places or wherever else there are gamblers . For his work , the runner receives about 20 percent of all bets handled , and on an average day that would be about $500 . Thus , a runner can make about $100 a day . As an independent entrepreneur , his annual income depends on the number of hours and days he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The numbers collector oversees a group of runners and so he makes more , perhaps as much as $70,000 a year on the average . ? Narcotics Dealing is considered much more dangerous and more socially unacceptable than gambling and is far more closely scrutinized by law enforcement officials . For the most part , it is dominated by members of organized crime , who are active in all phases of drug traffic  --  obtaining , distributing and selling . According to the Drug Enforcement Administration , it costs about $28,000 a year to maintain the habit of a drug addict , and there are an estimated 110,000 to 160,000 such addicts in the United States . Besides addicts , there are an estimated 10 million marijuana users in the country . Although the efforts to control marijuana are relatively weak , considerable profit is still made from its sale . But the real money is in hard drugs , where the process of diluting heroin or other narcotics and the continuous price markups along the route from grower to consumer make the ultimate profit enormous for everyone involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained in Mexico or elsewhere can earn the wholesaler $1 million after the drug has been cut and broken down into small packages . The heroin then goes to a supplier , who recuts it , repackages it and makes another $500,000 on the shipment . Finally the drug is diluted again , put into smaller packages and sold on the street , gleaning the pusher an additional $300,000 profit per kilo sold . At this point the heroin is about one-fifteenth of its original strength . Everyone , from original importer to final pusher , can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , although most of it is shared with the overall organization . Of course , because of the nature of the work , a person in narcotics may be on easy street one day and in jail the next . ? Loan Sharking is another illegal enterprise where organized crime predominates . Fast loans at stupendous rates of interest make for great profits , although sometimes considerable violence must be used to ensure payment . Most states ' usury laws limit interest rates to 1.5 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks charge 20 percent a week on short-term loans and 15 percent per week on longer-term transactions . Loan sharks , who share their profits with the mob in return for its protection and the use of its musclemen , can make over $175,000 a year on the average . ? Hijacking is another widespread and profitable crime . Whole truck loads or boxcar loads of goods are often stolen by hijackers and sold to fences for redistribution into the market . Hijacking profits depend on the size of the theft and the number of accomplices , which can be many . The rewards of success are great and incomes of over $100,000 a year on a continuous basis are possible . On a somewhat smaller scale , industrial theft can also produce substantial profits . Rather than by the truckload , individual manufactured items can be removed from the production line in a quiet and occasional manner . This can add up if the product is , for example , a TV set retailing at $550 . If a hundred sets were pulled off the line for " testing- every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $60,000 in one year or even more if they can sell the goods without a fence . This form of theft is common with products ranging from books to bulldozers , with the elements of profit and risk rising as the value of the product increases . ? Auto Theft . There were 968,000 reports of auto theft in the United States in 1978 , and this profitable crime continues to increase every year . A competent auto thief generally gets about one-quarter the value of the car from a fence or a car salesman who directly handles stolen vehicles . A thief turning over 20 cars a year for resale can make an average of $20,000 to $25,000 a year , and this is often a handsome supplement to a salary earned in some legitimate phase of the automobile service business . ? Fraud , " con " games and scams of every description are very common elements of crime in this country . The number and variety of frauds and con games are enormous . They can range from stock certificate swindles and complicated bankruptcy frauds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some involve counterfeit securities , others include orders placed for goods that are delivered but never paid for , phony gambling establishments that take bets but never pay off and even Continued on page 112 " Taking lt " Easy continued front page 63 gypsy fortune tellers who urge their clients to turn over their money in order to remove the root of evil . It has been estimated that some highly talented con men moving in prosperous circles make over $200,000 in an exceptional year and can easily make $50,000 in an average year . Panhandlers with a tale to tell ( as distinguished from mere beggars who earn $20 to $30 on a good day ' can be consummate professionals and earn princely sums at their trade . One of the most famous was Yellow Kid Weill who made an estimated $8 to $15 million in his lifetime , traveling leisurely around the country . However , he died in a poverty ward like so many of his kind . Faith healers , sellers of miracle medicines , exorcists and the like abound . The successful ones can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Kidnappers and Hit Men . In 1532-33 the conquistador Francisco Pizarro kidnapped the ruler of the Incas and held him for a ransom approximately equivalent to $120 million in modern currency . This record sum dwarfs the highest paid in modern times , when two businessmen were kidnapped in 1975 by political terrorists in Argentina and returned for $60 million , Kidnapping has not been very successful in recent years in the United States because of the efficiency of the FBI in handling this crime which is so abhorrent to society . Most recent attempts have failed , usually because the kidnapper is seized when the ransom is handed over or soon afterwards . Murder for pay is one of the most dramatized of all crimes in America , yet the average pay is only $2,000 to $3,000 for a murder . Bodily damage inflicted on recalcitrant debtors , employees who do not contribute their full share or enforcers who overstep their bounds is even less profitable ; $500 would be good pay for an assault . Of course , independent hit men and specialized or unusually difficult jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public even more than hit men , and popular literature in America is filled with fictionalizations of their lives , interviews with those in " the game " and even scholarly studies of their social backgrounds and roles . Prostitutes differ in how they go about their profession as much as they do in their incomes ; they can be straightforward streetwalkers , work bars of varying class and clientele , be independent call girls or members of a call girl group controlled by a pimp or they can be managed by a madam . Independent call girls can earn $50,000 a year , getting from $200 to $500 for a night 's work . Some call girls share their earnings with a pimp who helps manage their financial affairs and acts as their protector on the job and companion during their leisure time . Pimps with three to five stylish and successful call girls can make as much as $300,000 a year and even more , although the overhead is high , Prostitutes who work in brothels or at a lower economic and performance level , such as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half or even two-thirds of their earnings to the management . Prostitutes who work out of bars usually charge from $25 to $50 per client . If they handle 10 or 15 clients in one night , sharing the proceeds with their pimp plus a percentage for the bartender or owner of the bar , they will come away with not much more than $175 or so for their work . This is moderate pay for what can be dangerous work . Streetwalkers generally have pimps who take care of their housing , clothing , health and legal expenses and even their dental bills . A streetwalker charges a fee of $20 to $50 per client and usually earns from $200 to $300 a night . If a pimp has three streetwalkers in his stable , he can gross over $3,000 a week , and if the girls also steal wallets , watches , etc. , from the clients , the income can be much higher  --  as much as $500,000 a year or more after expenses . However , this represents pimping at an unusually lucrative level compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often short and uncertain . Violent encounters with competitors , jail sentences , the police and operators of the omnipresent drug traffic are always threats . Regardless of the nature of the work , criminals seek more than anything else to avoid prison sentences . However , if worst comes to worst , and a criminal ends up in jail , it does not necessarily mean that his money-making days are over or even suspended . Organized crime leaders have administered the activities of their mobs from a jail cell , and prisoners have perpetrated great cons and scams on those outside the walls . In the Greenfield , Massachusetts , House of Detention during the early 1970s , inmates secured the loan of an extremely valuable stamp collection under the guise of holding a stamp exhibition for rehabilitative purposes . The stamps were replaced by fakes and the real ones were later fenced out of the country . This article is a testament of sorts to the devotion of Americans to the principle of free enterprise , entrepreneurship and the unrelenting quest for greater income . It proves that whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve is there . Nothing will stop the entrepreneur from taking advantage of the situation , turning challenges and obstacles into financial gain . Society can not halt this ambition ; we can only hope to channel it into constructive rather than destructive output that will enrich not only the individual but the public  --  instead of operating at our expense .
