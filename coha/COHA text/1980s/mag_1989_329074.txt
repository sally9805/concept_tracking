If airline passengers during this busy traveling summer had qualms about flying aboard a DC-10 , last week 's drumbeat of new troubles gave them no consolation . Eight days after United Airlines Flight 232 crash-landed in Sioux City , Iowa , killing 111 of its 286 passengers and crew , a Korean Air Lines DC- 10 carrying 199 people plowed into an olive grove near Tripoli , Libya . As was the case in Sioux City , a majority of those aboard the KAL flight survived , but as many as 80 were killed . The same day in Los Angeles a United DC-10 had another close call : though the pilot reported a hydraulic leak , he managed to bring in his plane without incident . One day later in Toronto , a Canadian International Airlines DC-10 en route from Rio de Janeiro landed safely after losing one of its ten landing wheels . <P> Though the DC-10 had suffered no serious problems since a string of crashes in the late 1970s , superstitious air travelers were beginning to wonder if the plane was now simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Airline Passengers Association , a Dallas-based consumer group that claims 110,000 members . After the Sioux City crash , the I.A.P.A. demanded that the Federal Aviation Administration investigate possible design flaws in the DC-10 and ground the nation 's fleet if necessary . <P> The I.A.P.A. pointed out that at least 17 DC-10s have been wrecked since the plane began flying 18 years ago ; that amounts to 3.8% of the 445 DC-10s built by McDonnell Douglas , a higher percentage than that recorded by comparable superjets like the Lockheed L-1011 ( 1.2% ) . Both the FAA and McDonnell Douglas rejected the I.A.P.A. 's request . Said FAA spokesman John Leyden : " There 's nothing that 's come out of the Sioux City accident indicating a basic design flaw that would warrant such an action . " <P> The Tripoli crash may not have been caused by a mechanical malfunction . Flight 803 left Seoul and made trouble-free stops in Thailand and Saudi Arabia . Approaching Tripoli 's airport in a dense morning fog , the pilot decided to land , even though only an hour earlier an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The KAL plane missed the runway by more than a mile , cartwheeled and slammed into two cars and two farmhouses . <P> The Toronto and Los Angeles scares were the sort of mishaps that have always plagued air travel ; pilot error , leaks , blown tires and engine shutdowns are frequent occurrences . But the Flight 232 disaster was of a different order altogether : a loss of all three of the plane 's redundant hydraulic systems at the same moment , rendering it almost impossible to control . FAA investigators are combing a 16-sq. - mi. area of Iowa cornfields for pieces of a fan disk of the plane 's No. 2 engine , which was mounted high on the DC-10 's tail . They hope that examining the fan disk will help them determine what caused an explosion that sent shards of metal through the plane 's tail section , severing all three hydraulic lines . <P> The nagging possibility of an inherent design flaw in the DC-10 remains . In 1979 an American Airlines DC-10 taking off from Chicago lost its left-wing engine , tearing out its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The I.A.P.A. won a federal court order that forced the FAA to ground the entire DC-10 fleet for inspection . The planes were inspected and sent aloft again five weeks later .
