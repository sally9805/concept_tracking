TOM HORN <P> Directed by William Wiard Screenplay by Thomas McGuane and BudShrake 4 i <P> " I never ate a bug that big before , " says I the old gunfighter ( Steve McQueen ) , faced down by a lobster at a cattlemen 's banquet in a raw Wyoming town . His voice is soft , whisky-warm and a bit rueful ; he knows that in 1901 his day is over , that he is out of place among the boost ers and dealers who have built the town and fenced the range . They have brought him here to wipe out a gang of rustlers , but his murderous skills and cranky in dependence make the clean-shirt-once-a-week crowd nervous . Before long , sure enough , they frame him for the cowardly killing of a boy of 15 . The situation is al most self-consciously classic , and there is a temptation to yell " Come back , Shane ! " at the screen . But it is a pleasure to watch Steve McQueen 's tough , weathered mug as he speaks the lines given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there is a bit too much of this sort of satisfaction , with a great many shots of McQueen looking tragical , Tom Horn is a good , honest try , a western that does not parody itself . - By John Skow
