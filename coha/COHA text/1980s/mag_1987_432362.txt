 | When the news of Wall Street 's first insider-trading scandal broke last fall , it was like the first drop of cyanide in the Tylenol bottle . It created a heck of a public-relations problem for the industry involved and set off a full-throttle advertising campaign to repair a plummeting image . While few of the top investment houses have been unscathed by the disclosures of insider trading , no one is launching an effort to communicate quite like Drexel Burnham Lambert 's . Not only is the reputation of the firm ? whose clients included Ivan Boesky ? at stake but so is that of one of its chief products , the high-yield debt offerings known as junk bonds . Drexel 's big guns Junk bonds are receiving about the same reception in the press these days as Boesky , so Drexel has assembled a heavy-hitting team to counteract the bad image . Within the past few months , Drexel has hired three different communications or lobbying firms in addition to its ad agency of three years , the award-winning Chiat-Day . A senior vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Barron 's , has been almost fully detached from his Los Angeles office to deal with the press . One of the new communications firms hired by Drexel is Sawyer/Miller in New York , which worked on Walter Mondale 's 1984 presidential campaign . Making the case for Drexel on Capitol Hill is Akin , Gump , Strauss , Hauer &; Feld , where Democratic power broker Robert Strauss toils . Says Mark Helmke , at yet another of Drexel 's public-relations firms , Robinson , Lake &; Lerer , in Washington : " They are taking a proactive approach . " To say the least . Fullpage ads in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times trumpet the innate goodness of junk bonds . Others tout the number of successful deals the firm has managed since the scandal broke . Still more outline " What Has n't Been in the News About Drexel Burnham in the Last 4 Weeks . " Says Anreder : " In the rhetoric , things get a little confused , and we 're trying to reinforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ads , but we also have to communicate , to be responsive to the press . " Firms that have so far been untainted by the insider-trading scandal have been doing some communicating of their own . In a recent ad for its mergers-and-acquisitions unit , Morgan Guaranty pointedly outlines " key characteristics " that " distinguish Morgan from other firms for M &A; advice and execution . " Among them : They claim not to promote " transactions simply to generate fees " and not to " provide research to institutional investors to generate brokerage commissions . " Cosby calms ' em E. F. Hutton also has avoided the insider cannon , but it retains an ad campaign left over from its own checkkiting scandal of last year . At the time , the firm brought in Bill Cosby , because , as Hutton Executive Vice President William Clayton said : " He felt that if we could convince him that we had learned from our mistakes , he could get consumers to believe it . " Drexel , too , continues to run a campaign rolled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Bears defensive lineman William " the Refrigerator " Perry and jazz great Dizzy Gillespie . It is too early to tell whether investors will respond positively to Drexel 's efforts , but the firm 's annual junk-bond conference in Beverly Hills two weeks ago drew a record crowd of 2,700 . Among the attendees were such clients as buyout kings Henry Kravis and George Roberts , presumed to have defected from Drexel , as well as TWA chairman and corporate raider Carl Icahn , who has acknowledged being under Securities and Exchange Commission investigation . Running the show was the chief of the junk-bond unit , Mike Milken , who is constantly rumored to be the next one to be nailed by the SEC , but who was , one guest reports , " very upbeat . " Anreder says the firm 's first-quarter results showed its revenue share from junk bonds up 10 percent from the same period last year . And the firm 's market share in securities underwriting has actually risen slightly since Boesky was exposed . Still , until the SEC has routed out all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street are likely to persist . No matter what the advertising , a clean house , says image-advertising specialist Barry Biederman , chairman of Biederman &; Company , " is the best kind of public relations . In a case like this , it 's the only kind . "
