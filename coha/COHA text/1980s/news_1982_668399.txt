Midway through the second searing rhythm-and-blues tune , Paul Rishell took one of those transcendent , screaming guitar breaks that make electric blues such a joyful music . His four-member band was cooking on all possible burners , and the Inn-Square Men ' s Bar bartender , himself an experienced musician and a man not known for extravagant statements , scribbled a note : " Most underrated band in the city . Every one a virtuoso . " A week later , at the late Idler folk club , Paul Rishell was performing solo , his fingers lovingly crafting intricate patterns on a National acoustic guitar , his deep , resonant voice moaning out an anguished country blues , and the word came up again , again from a respected musician : " Paul ' s really underrated . He ' s been so good for so long , people take it for granted . And the incredible thing is he keeps getting better . " Paul Rishell is 32 , a Cambridge resident since 1970 , modest almost to the point of self-effacement , and clearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chartered 747s : " I would be happy if I could just travel around the country , knowing there was an audience that wanted to hear this kind of music . " Rishell has three different audiences , because he works in three settings : solo in folk clubs ; as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist in a trio that appeals to fans of bright 1950s and ' 60s rock and calypso ; and as lead guitarist and vocalist in the band that draws a hard-driving R &B; crowd . Rishell is knowledgable about every kind of popular music , and a conversation with him is studded with the names of great originals he admires , all idiosyncratic , uncompromising artists , most in the blues tradition , but encompassing a wide array of music history : Son House , Scrapper Blackwell , Blind Boy Fuller , Spider John Koerner , Aretha Franklin , Otis Redding , Sam Cooke , Django Reinhardt , Howlin ' Wolf , Brownie McGhee , Carl Perkins , Merle Haggard , Joseph Spence , Jimi Hendrix , Captain Beefheart , Dan Hicks , James Burton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opening act early in the ' 70s before becoming a full member of Peter C. Johnson and the Manic Depressives . " My first instrument was drums , " he said over a Saturday lunch at the Casablanca , " starting in 1963 . But by 1968 I had discovered blues and the guitar . It is music that speaks right to you , to the heart and soul . It can lift you up from the lowest place . If you know it , blues is joyful ; if you don ' t know the joy , you don ' t know the blues . Son House ( Mississippi delta bottleneck guitarist and soulful singer ) is the greatest . He was part preacher , part singer , brought gospel to the blues , going back and forth , with a fear of God like a little child ' s . " By 1975 , Johnson was tired of ensemble work , and disappeared into his apartment filled with thousands of dollars worth of sophisticated electronics to make a " half-man , half-machine " album .

" Later the trio ( Reed Butler , bass , and Michael Kernan , lead guitar ) and the band ( Chuck Laire , drums ; Albie Balgochian , bass ; Arnie Fox , harmonica ) were formed . The band may be the hardest driving aggregation in the city . Laire and Balgochian lay down rhythms strong enough to support convoys of tanks , and Fox , a bear of a man with a lyrical harmonica style that calls up the legend of Sonny Boy Williamson , trades soaring leads and breaks with Rishell while walking all over the room , even out into the street to blow the message to startled motorists . He and Rishell have great rapport ; they met in Passim ' s tiny back room six years ago and have been playing together since . " It ' s a great way to make a living , " said Rishell , " very , very tough , but great . It ' s the only way I know . " The band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
