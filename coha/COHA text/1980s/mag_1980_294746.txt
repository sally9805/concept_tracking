The walls are bare in the large office on M Street except for a print of a Norman Rockwell portrait of Ronald Reagan . On a conference table lie nearly 100 letters in careful rows , waiting for signatures . On the desk is a picture frame , but instead of family photographs ( wife and three children ) it contains a schedule , neatly filled with appointments , six days a week , beginning with a daily 7 a.m. planning meeting with top assistants and ending often at 8 p.m . Next to the schedule is a clock . <P> The office is the headquarters of the Reagan transition team , and its sparse , precise furnishings reflect the personality of its occupant : Edwin Meese III , 49 , whose affable manner and Teddy bear frame belie the analytical mind that for 13 years has made him one of Reagan 's most trusted advisers . Now , as No. 1 aide to the President-elect , Meese is coordinating Reagan 's transition to power . <P> In Washington , Meese has functioned as smoothly and effectively for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sacramento . He is accessible to politicians , reporters , Carter Administration officials-anyone who matters in the capital . He has a self-effacing lack of interest , rare in Washington , in the trappings of personal power . <P> Meese chairs most meetings of Reagan 's top advisers . He jots down the often conflicting views in his ever present spiral notebook and later distills them into well-reasoned , easily digested , single-page memos or brief oral reports to Reagan , just as he has been doing since 1967 , when he first joined the Governor 's staff . Says Edward Thomas , Meese 's chief aide : " He can hash out a complex issue until it can be stated as simply as A , B , C. It puts the Governor right at ease . " After Jan. 20 , Meese will perform much the same role as coordinator of the inner circle of Cabinet-level officials . <P> Because Meese rarely interjects his own views into discussions and his memos are objective , he is accused of having no political ideas of his own , a charge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative , " meaning that he favors less Government but is not bound to a rigid anti-Government ideology . " I have a lawyer 's sense that your purpose is to serve your client , " says Meese , a former prosecutor . " My service to Ronald Reagan is to see that he gets objective advice and to filter out my own personal viewpoint . But the idea that I do n't have any particular philosophical viewpoints is baloney . " <P> Meese never seems harried and rarely seems to mind when staff members interrupt him . Reports TIME Correspondent Walter Isaacson , after observing Meese in action : " Every time his door opened , there was a staffer sticking his head in with a brief request . ' Sure , no problem , ' Meese says over and over . <P> Scheduler Chuck Tyson wants to put an item on the agenda for Reagan 's visit this week . ' Let 's go over it , ' Meese says , putting on his glasses . Then he spots an old friend wandering in the hall . ' Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces him around . Every conversation starts with a pleasantry . Often a visitor , who has carefully planned the quickest way to say what he needs to say , is disarmed . "
