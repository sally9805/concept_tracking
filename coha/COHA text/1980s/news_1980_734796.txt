txt THE UNITED States Air Force , which lost thousands of its pilots to the higher-paying comercial airlines in the 1970s , , is Hying to rehire many of those who have been laid off during the recession . " We 're projecting that we 'll be 2,000 pilots short by the end of fiscal year 1981 Sept. 30 , 1981 , " said Maj. Thomas O'Beirne , chief of the recall program at the Air Force personnel center in San Antonio , Tex . " We have managed to keep , our line units manned thus far , but have had to rob from our staff and administrative jobs to do it , " he said . O'BEIRNE HEADS a team of pilot recruitment officers who will visit Chicago Dec. 8-12 to interview unemployed airline pilots in the recruiting office at 800 Lee St. , Des Plaines . The Chicago area is the home of many airline pilots , who are based at O'Hare International Airport . Chicago also is the headquarters of United Airlines . The Air Force team already has visited Denver and Dallas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,700 pilots nationwide have been furloughed by the airlines , which traditionally drew about 60 per cent of their pilots from the Air Force . " We know of more than 800 former Air Force officers who will be on the street by Dec. 1 , " O'Beirne said . THE PRINCIPAL advantage in recruiting airline pilots back to duty is that the Air Force saves millions of dollars that would have .. been spent training new pilots . " Most of these guys are fairly current , so there is not much training involved , " O'Beirne said . Most layoffs by the airlines involved low-seniority pilots who left the military in the mid- ' 70s . " The Air Force just could n't pay them as much as they could make flying for the airlines , " O'Beirne said . Air Force pay still is considerably lower than that of the airlines , but it is better than unemployment compensation . A major with 12 years of experience makes roughly $30,000 a year . An airline pilot with the same amount of experience can make up to $80,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no loss in seniority or rank and will guarantee the pilot 's choice of base and airplane , O'Beirne said . However , the returning pilots must sign up for a four-year tour of duty . THE PROGRAM to induce airline employes back into the military actually began two years ago , and so far 334 pilots have rejoined , along with 82 navigators and 73 scientific , technical , and engineering officers . " This year , we 're shooting for 550 people , including 320 pilots , " O'Beirne said .
