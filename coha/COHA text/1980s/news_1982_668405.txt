DAYTONA BEACH , Fla. - " Just put down King . I ' m not going to tell you my first name , " she said . Thirty-two years ago , King , the daughter of a black Alabama farm family , came east with her husband to this resort city on Florida ' s Atlantic coast . Now she has two teen-age daughters , and she worries about their future . Last Tuesday afternoon , she stood watch outside a neighborhood precinct , playing a small part in the first campaign she has known firsthand in her 50 years . " I don ' t get food stamps and I don ' t get welfare , but some people do and they need it , " she said , adding that after years of support for the incumbent Democrat , she has no more patience for the conservative politics of Democratic Rep. Bill Chappell . " He ' s with Mr. Reagan all the way , " she said . " We don ' t need that . We don ' t even need Mr. Reagan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first campaign and hours later , her first loss . By 2- 1 margins , black precincts in Daytona voted against Chappell , yet soon after the first returns came in , the seven-term congressman was certain of victory in the toughest , most costly primary fight he has faced . " My special interest is the people , and the people have a special interest in me , " he told the television cameras that night , but what made Chappell ' s race most special was that his fight was not with Republicans but with his own party . Chappell is a senior member of the Boll Weevil caucus - the group of conservative Democrats , primarily from the South , who have repeatedly broken with the House leadership to support the Administration ' s economic program . For the first time this year , Chappell faced a well-financed challengefrom the left in a bitter primary contest that attracted national attention . After a three-way race Sept. 7 , he was forced into a runoff last week against businessman Reid Hughes . Although Chappell got a decisive 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to triumph over a man who had never before run for public office . A multimillionaire , Hughes poured an estimated $550,000 of his own money into the race , and though outspent going into September , Chappell appeared at least to match Hughes in the runoff , as business and defense interests rushed money to the conservative ' s campaign . A liberal coalition of environmental , labor and feminist organizations brought out volunteers for Hughes , while the American Medical Assn. and National Rifle Assn. tapped their membership for the incumbent . " Vote , Vote , Bill Chappell " read the sign at Buck ' s Gun Rack a few blocks from King ' s precinct . ( As if torn about giving up all of his advertising space , the shop owner used the opposite side to advertise a $329 special price on a Beretta , semiautomatic 9mm pistol . ) In an election year when Democrats seem certain to increase their strength in the House , the anatomy of the Chappell-Hughes fight is a striking portrait of the divisions within the party and the durability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own leadership than the money of outside interests . As one of the most senior members of the Boll Weevil caucus , Chappell belonged to a core group of two dozen Democrats who consistently crossed the aisle in the first 18 months of the Administration to help President Ronald Reagan implement his tax and budget cuts . Three Boll Weevil members have been defeated in primaries this year . But as the Democrats try to fatten their majority at the expense of Republicans in the North , the party leadership has had little success against Southern conservatives . Apart from Chappell , Alabama ' s Richard Shelby was the only other Southern Democrat to be seriously challenged for his loyalty to the President . Despite complaints by state labor and black leaders , the Tuscaloosa conservative won by nearly a 2-1 margin last month . Rep. Billy Lee Evans of Georgia was defeated in a race that had more to do with his divorce and election law violations than any economic issues . The leadership ' s only clear success has come outside the South . Rep. Ronald Mottl of Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nevada Rep. James Santini , who cashed in on his conservatism to win campaign contributions from oil interests , lost in his bid to unseat incumbent Sen. Howard Cannon . Pennsylvania Rep. Eugene Atkinson and Rep. Bob Stump of Arizona have both become Republicans , so if the Democrats have any hope of getting a fourth scalp , it will be Atkinson ' s in western Pennsylvania . " I think if you look back , conservative Democrats have weathered the elections pretty well , " said Rep. Phil Gramm , a Boll Weevil who easily won his Texas primary with little help from the 17 county chairmen in his district . With a large campaign chest , Gramm is free to roam his state on a speaking tour this fall ; it is this access to money outside of the party that helps him to remain independent of his leadership . Chappell ' s race illustrates the same point : The National Realtors Assn. , which bought television and newspaper ads for him in the runoff , was more important to his victory than any party committee . Gramm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political action committees - allied with the President ' s economic program and the GOP - gave freely rather than see a conservative defeated . As much as the campaign became a proxy war for outside interests , it also brought to the surface the unusual mix of politics in Florida , a state that will gain four new House seats to become the seventh largest delegation in the House next year . Chappell , a former speaker of the state Legislature , is identified with the conservatives in the old " Pork Chop Gang , " which once dominated state politics . His strength has always been in the more inland , rural counties and the suburbs south of Jacksonville , where the influence of military installations in the state is strongest . Redistricting this year moved the incumbent closer to the coast , so more than ever the heart of the District is in Volusia County , which includes the beachfront hotels and raceway of Daytona , and runs inland to Deland , its white brick courthouse sitting across from a small plaza of trees hanging with Spanish moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern veneer . " Try our roast beef , it has natural juice , " said a waitress to a baffled elderly visitor from the North . With its topless bars and fast food joints , Daytona has a seedy quality that detracts from its natural beauty . In the September primary , Hughes carried Volusia County . His downfall last week can be largely explained by his failure to win it again . In Putnam and Clay counties inland , Chappell widened his margin , but his real success came in bringing out his vote in Volusia and capturing conservative support that had previously gone to a candidate eliminated in the primary . The runoff helped the race win national attention , but locally it best served Chappell ' s interests . Hughes ' best chance of victory was in the September primary ; the runoff degenerated into a negative campaign for both men and distracted attention from the issues the challenger tried to raise . With unemployment at 6 percent , it was difficult to make the economy an issue . Hughes had the support of blacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security . A check of four predominantly black precincts in Daytona showed that Hughes benefited significantly from an increased turnout in the runoff , despite the fact that his contest was virtually the only Democratic contest on the ballot that day . Among the elderly , Hughes picked up support by sharply attacking Chappell ' s voting record on Social Security . But his fellow Florida Democrat , Rep. Claude Pepper , taped a television commercial on Chappell ' s behalf for the runoff . The results could be seen last week , when Chappell increased his vote by almost 28 percent at three precincts dominated by housing projects for the elderly and Hughes ' tally showed a slight decline . As " Mr. Social Security , " Pepper ' s endorsement could prove an embarrassment to Democrats attacking Republicans for the same budget votes Hughes was trying to turn against Chappell . " Pepper helped to turn it , " said Chappell , exhausted the morning after his victory . " Anytime Claude wants me , " he said smiling , " I ' ll come down ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
