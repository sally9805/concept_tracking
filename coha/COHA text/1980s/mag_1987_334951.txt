" We still face profitability challenges , " Mellon Bank Chairman J. David Barnes warned shareholders a year ago in the Pittsburgh-based institution 's annual report . It was an accurate prophecy . The nation 's twelfth largest bank holding company ( current assets : $34.4 billion ) earlier this month reported a quarterly loss of nearly $60 million  --  the first in its 118-year history  --  and watched shares plummet in just nine days from nearly 51 to around 38 . Last week Barnes , 57 , faced a new challenge : finding a job . One of the nation 's best-known families of financiers and philanthropists had taken charge again of the bank bearing its name , ousting the chairman in the process . <P> Barnes ' tenure was relatively brief but superheated . After becoming chairman in 1981 , the Harvard-educated lawyer pumped Mellon loans to energy companies in the Southwest and beefed up its real estate portfolio in Dallas and other oil towns . The lending and real estate business foundered along with OPEC : energy-related loans now account for more than half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mellon also has $178 million in repossessed properties , a sixfold increase from what it owned in late 1984 . Bad loans to Mexico and Brazil further crimped the bank 's strained resources . To make matters worse , Barnes soured relations in 1984 with a longtime local client , Gulf , by deciding to lend $150 million to Corporate Raider T. Boone Pickens , who had previously tried to take over Gulf . <P> All this was finally too much for the heirs of both Founder Thomas Mellon and his son Andrew , who was Treasury Secretary to Presidents Harding , Coolidge and Hoover . Only one direct descendant , Seward Prosser Mellon , 44 , still serves on the board , but family members together hold 15% of the bank 's stock , providing effective control . They picked as Barnes ' acting replacement Nathan Pearson , 75 , a longtime financial adviser to Philanthropist Paul Mellon , who holds 9% of the bank 's shares . Heading the search committee that begins meeting this week to find Barnes ' successor is Andrew Mathieson , who advises the heirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two names are believed to have the committee 's interest : David Nordby , 47 , executive vice president of Chicago 's Continental Illinois Bank ; and Silas Keehn , 56 , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago . Both were promising Mellon executives who moved on after Barnes became chairman . One factor that could favor Nordby : colleagues say he is an expert at dealing with bad loans .
