At his alma mater , Reagan puts forth a traditional vision <P> It has been more than half a century since Ronald Reagan lived in the flat , folksy precincts of north central Illinois . For the residents of his principal home town , absence has surely made the heart grow fonder . On his 73rd birthday last Monday , Reagan made his first stopover as President in Dixon ( pop . 15,700 ) . " I 've never seen this town so happy , " said Mayor James Dixon , a Democrat and **26;5408;TOOLONG of Dixon 's founder . <P> The President had a White House-catered lunch ( salad , soup and pork ) with First Brother Neil at one of their several boyhood homes and then flew to Eureka College , both brothers ' alma mater . There , in the Reagan Physical Education Center , before virtually the entire 516-member student body , he inaugurated TIME 'S Distinguished Speakers Program . Twice a year , TIME will sponsor an address by one of its cover subjects at a college of his or her choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " the 34th anniversary of my 39th birthday " ) . In the course of 25 minutes Reagan discussed " the changes that have happened to America in the 50-odd years . . . since I left this campus . " He quoted five historical figures , from Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald to Pope Pius XII , and alluded to a dozen contemporary conservatives , from Economist Milton Friedman to Philosopher Jean-Marie Benoist .

By 1932 , my graduation year . . . the Depression years were upon us , and over those radio sets , now sitting in every parlor , came the rich , reassuring tones of Franklin Roosevelt . All of us who lived through those years can remember the drabness the Depression brought . But we remember too how people pulled together-that sense of community and shared values , that belief in American enterprise and democracy that saw us through . There seemed a certain logic to arguments that national Government should take onto itself new and sweeping prerogatives . Many of us could not see the enormous and oftentimes harmful political changes that this expanded role for the Government would bring . As I look back , the rapidity of that political change was as astonishing as the change brought by technology .
