Britain ' s ailing pound took another beating in the foreign-exchange market yesterday , falling below $1. 13 for the first time ever on rumors that Nigeria was about to quit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Although the rumors were denied by the Nigerian government , they sent the pound skidding to a record low of $1. 1260 in late New York trading from $1. 1440 Wednesday . " Something like that is serious business when it comes to the pound , " said Fred Katzman , a vice president of Britain ' s Midland Bank in New York . The foreign-exchange market sees the rumors as heralding still more cuts in oil prices , which could hurt Britain by reducing its revenue from North Sea oil . Britain already cut its oil prices earlier this week . Traders said it appeared that Britain ' s central bank intervened in the foreign-exchange market when the pound fell below $1. 13 , but that the intervention  --  if there was one  --  had little effect . The dollar also strengthened against most other major foreign currencies yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After trading at slightly more than 3. 14 West German marks for most of the day , the dollar suddenly spurted to 3. 1615 marks late in the afternoon . " There was a feeling that it was a bargain at the lower levels , " said Jeff Brummette , an assistant secretary of Irving Trust Co . , New York , " and people rushed back into the market to buy dollars . " Only the Japanese yen managed to hold its own against the dollar . The U.S. currency eased slightly in late New York trading to 254. 40 yen from 254. 45 yen on Wednesday . In early Friday trading in Tokyo , however , the dollar rose to 254. 66 yen . The dollar received additional support late in the afternoon when it was reported that M1 , the basic U.S. money-supply measure , had fallen only $500 million in the latest reporting week . The foreign-exchange market had been expecting a more sizeable decline . Declines in M1 frequently mean the Federal Reserve can ease credit , which usually leads to lower U.S. interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vice president at Wells Fargo Bank International , New York , said the M1 figure " should give support to the dollar at the lower end of the range at which it ' s been trading recently . " So far this year , the dollar has yet to trade at less than 3. 14 West German marks . But Mr. McTague cautioned that " there is growing optimism that we could see another cut in interest rates here , " which could hurt the dollar . Mr. Brummette agreed that U.S. interest rates " could slide a bit , " although he thinks the bottom is close at hand . He said several economic indicators due to be announced next week could support the dollar enough for it to make another assault on 3. 18 marks . The dollar has yet to exceed 3. 1780 marks , the 12-year high it reached Jan. 2 . Mr. Katzman said there were two other factors yesterday that helped the dollar . One was a speech given by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker in Washington , in which he expressed optimism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a report that the U.S. producer price index for December , due to be announced today , will show an increase of only 0. 1% , which would indicate that inflation in the U.S. remains low . A low level of inflation means that the " real " return on dollar-denominated investments remains high , and that helps the U.S. currency . On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for delivery this month fell $1. 10 an ounce , to $303. 10 . Contracts for all deliveries amounted to a moderate 3. 3 million ounces .
