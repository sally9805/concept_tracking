" For many women , the personal dilemma of the 1980s is how to balance the demands of a career with the responsibilities of being a wife and mother . At the center of the debate is the nature of basic relationships between men and women . After two decades of progress , American women are pushing ahead to open new opportunities in all aspects of life from politics and the family to business , law and international affairs . " The ultimate outcome is very positive not just for women but for the whole texture of American society , " says Ellen Futter , president of Barnard College in New York City . " Opening up choices for women opens them up for men , too . " IN THE POLITICAL ARENA , women are showing new strength not only as candidates but as a key voting bloc as well . " When I was growing up , brothers , not sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro . " It is terrific that we are now saying to ourselves that we can run and win . I see a woman making a presidential bid in 1988 . " Where women are making impressive gains is at the state and local level . In 15 years , the number of women elected to state legislatures has more than tripled ? from 301 in 1969 to 993 in 1984 . In 1982 , Rhode Island elected nine women to the State Senate . North Dakota has a woman Speaker of the House , and about 30 percent of New Hampshire 's Legislature is female . There are three lieutenant governors and 11 elected secretaries of state . In Texas , Ann Richards became the first woman in 50 years to be elected to statewide office when she won the race for state treasurer in 1982 . " In the next 10 years , we 'll see some striking changes in the composition of the House and Senate as more women get elected to office at the state level , " says Betty Heitman , cochair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century , there 's an excellent chance of having a woman President . " Moving up . Women also are gaining prominence in the nation 's cities . Six major urban centers , including Houston and San Francisco , now are run by women . In all , 7 percent of America 's mayors are women , as are 10 percent of citycouncil members and 30 percent of school-board members . While the number of women in local government has soared , running for office still is a relatively new phenomenon . Females account for only 13 percent of state legislators . Of the 534 members of the Congress , only 24 are female . Recently elected Governor Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky is the only female heading a state . " The hard fact is that we have to have more women waging campaigns and gaining prominence at all levels of government , " says Representative Olympia Snowe ( R-Me . ) . In the November elections , women are expected to top the 1982 record of 55 nominees for congressional seats . Political leaders caution that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slim . Many women candidates are challenging incumbents who have a definite edge . Studies also show that there is resistance among voters ? male and female ? to electing women to high office . Thus , the nomination of Ferraro as Democratic vice-presidential candidate is seen as a two-edged sword . While she may gain women voters for the ticket , there is fear that she may reduce support among some professional and bluecollar males in the South and West . Raising money remains a problem for female candidates . In 1982 , more than 3,000 political-action committees spent 35 million dollars on congressional races ? but only 7 percent of the funds went to female candidates . In this election , the Democrats are setting up a special campaign fund to aid women candidates , while the Republicans have promised to " go all out for our women . " Not all women who run for office are automatically given high marks by activist women 's groups . Kentucky 's Collins , who chaired the Democratic national convention , is considered lukewarm in her support of women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all women candidates , " says lawyer Phyllis Schlafly , leader of the conservative Eagle Forum . " I would like to see more women in high office but not just because . they are women . " GOP out front . Until recently , the Republican Party took the lead in encouraging women to run for office . The nation 's two female senators are Republicans : Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Paula Hawkins of Florida . Since the election of Ronald Reagan , the Democratic Party has outperformed the GOP in gaining women voters . A July Harris poll found that 46 percent of women said they were Democrats , compared with 28 percent who identified themselves as Republicans . In 1980 , 3 million fewer women than men voted for Ronald Reagan . Since then , the gender gap has persisted , with women as a whole consistently giving the President lower marks on job performance than men . Democrats are trying to capitalize on this skepticism . In the recently adopted platform were planks calling for passage of the equal-rights amendment and policies encouraging equal pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also differ from men on certain issues . They are more likely to support government funds for social programs and endorse peace initiatives such as a freeze on nuclear weapons . They tend to oppose military involvement in foreign countries and believe that Reagan 's budget cuts have been unfair to women . Says Ethel Klein , associate professor of political science at Columbia University : " Women place high emphasis on education , environment , health and protection against personal violence . " To some political strategists , there is evidence that women may provide the needed base to build a new coalition  | among the diverse ? and sometimes warring ? groups in the Democratic Party . " I offer an opportunity to the people who are left out to get involved ? not just women but all seniors , the poor , blacks and other minorities , " says Minnesota 's Joan Crowe , who beat out three male opponents for the endorsement of the state 's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in her bid for the U.S. Senate . At the same time , a number of feminist women belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth district , Republican candidate Carrie Francke , who backs the equal-rights amendment and abortion rights , is running against a Democratic incumbent , Harold Volkmer , who is more conservative on social issues . " No political party has a monopoly on women , " says Dorothy Ridings , president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters . " The gender gap is based on issues ? not on parties . " In sheer numbers , women have enormous voting power . They make up 53 percent of the voting-age population , and since 1964 have outnumbered men at the polls . In the 1980 election , nearly 6 million more women voted than did men . In 1982 gubernatorial races , women were credited with giving the margins of victory to Mario Cuomo in New York , James Blanchard in Michigan and Mark White in Texas . All this is pointing to the November election as a turning point for women in politics . " What 's happening is that women have discovered their political muscle and they 're using it to bring about change , " says Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood of female workers into the job market , overall economic progress for women has been slow . The wage gap between earnings of men and women has remained constant for three decades , with women averaging only 62 cents for every dollar men make . Even in professional fields , the wage gap persists . A Columbia University study found that after 10 years in business the average male with a master 's degree in business administration was earning 20 percent more than his female counterpart : $49,356 compared with $40,022 . In science and engineering , women 's salaries range from 10 to 20 percent below men 's . In computer programing , women make 81 percent of what men earn . To be sure , many more women are moving into management . The Census Bureau reports that since 1972 the number of female administrators and managers has risen from fewer than 18 percent to more than 32 percent . Yet very few women hold senior management posts in large firms . Economists point out that the surge of women into business only began in the early 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to be in line  | for top executive positions . A new Census Bureau report notes that women 's progress and pay levels continue to be held down because a far greater number of women than men interrupt careers for family reasons . To Prof. Myra Strober , director of Stanford 's Center for Research on Women , a basic problem is that male executives tend to choose successors who are like themselves . Explains Strober : " We 're not at the point where cloning is neutral on sex . A man usually thinks of another man . " Many women are going into business for themselves . The number of women starting businesses as sole proprietors jumped 10 percent between 1980 and 1982 , compared with a 1 percent increase for self-employed men . Companies owned by women now account for an estimated 40 billion dollars in sales . One boom area for women is in high-tech computer firms . A recent survey by Computer Retailing News listed Portia Isaacson , president of Future Computing , and Lorraine Mecca , president of Micro D , as two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collars , low pay . For many women at the low end of the earnings scale , the wage gap is fostered by the clustering of female workers in relatively low-paying " pink collar " jobs such as grade-school teaching , nursing and clerical work . One key issue now is equal pay for jobs judged to be of " comparable worth . " Women contend that traditionally female jobs have been systematically undervalued by men who set salaries . They argue that so-called objective criteria might show that a social worker should be paid as much as a welder or a secretary as much as a plumber . But many employers say the value of jobs should be determined by market demand . The concept is being fought out in court cases from t Gains in Male-Dominated Fields Women as Share of Total Nassau County , N.Y. , to Tacoma , Wash . Last year , Washington State employes in predominantly female occupations won higher wages and back pay when a federal judge ruled that they had been victims of wage discrimination . But the same appeals court rejected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors . While the outlook is brighter for younger workers , there is concern over the plight of older women . Statistics show that women over 65 are almost twice as likely to be below the poverty line than are men . Private pensions for women average $3,013 a year , compared with $4,731 for men . Social Security benefits also tend to be lower . Despite such concerns , many economists predict that the  | overall earning power of women will increase , especially if the economy continues to grow . The wave of female workers who started their careers in the 1970s is gaining seniority in the labor force . The next generation of women , who come to the workplace with higher levels of education and training , is destined to narrow the wage gap significantly during the next decade . THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY roles are in a state of flux . For many women , the dilemma of the 1980s is how to balance a job with marriage and motherhood . The image of the nuclear family with a breadwinning father and a full-time housewife mother represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that in more than 60 percent of families both the husband and wife work . Some 66 percent of women who are single parents are in the labor force . All in all , 33 million children have mothers who work full time . " The period of establishing a family overlaps with the period of establishing a career , " says Malkah Notman , director of the Women 's Resource Center at Tufts University in Boston . " It 's a question of juggling competing demands ? and it helps if one does n't need to sleep . " The fastest-growing group of working mothers is those with very young children . By 1983 , 33 percent of mothers with babies under 7 months old were employed ? up from 21 percent in 1978 . " This is happening because women are having their careers in place first , " says Vivian Cadden , editor of Working Mother magazine . " Then they are getting maternity leave and going right back to work . " In the past , women who pursued careers did not usually have a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for the Social Sciences at Columbia University and author of Woman 's Proper Place . Of female physicians working in health clinics in the 1920s , 40 percent had never married , 40 percent of those married got divorces and 30 percent had no children . In the 1980s , many women are rejecting the either/ or choice of job vs. home and are trying to do both . As a result , dating patterns and marriage roles have changed , with women getting married later and having fewer children . Conflicting views . Nevertheless , most women still carry the main responsibility for balancing the demands of work and home . In a study of Harvard Medical School alumni who graduated between 1967 and 1977 , 85 percent of the women said that integrating career and family life was a problem , while only 35 to 40 percent of the men saw any conflict . For many working mothers , the myth of being a superwoman has given way to the recognition that raising children and having a career is a trade-off of difficult choices . " You feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids need you , and you also feel guilty when you 're home and think you should have spent more time at work , " says Debby Hoesterey , 33 , a Denver teacher and mother of two . For working parents , arranging adequate child care is a major problem . The Census Bureau estimates that 5 million children under age 5 are in some type of day-care program . Roughly 30 percent are looked after in their homes . About 40 percent are taken care of in home-based programs , and 9 percent are enrolled in day-care centers . An additional 1.7 million women with young children report that they would take a job if adequate day care were available . Dependable help . " What working women need to know is that they can depend on their husbands and on quality day-care centers to help care for their children , " says Dr. David Hefelfinger of the University of Alabama . The long-range impact of day care on children is not yet known . A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences found that school achievement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same . Despite reports of abuse at some facilities , most licensed day-care centers are safe and reasonably well run , officials say . Yet costs can pose problems . Prices range from $2,000 a year in a home setting to as much as $6,000 in private centers . Judy and Roger McCarter of San Antonio , Tex. , placed their son , now 7 , in a private day-care center when he was 21/2 months old and recently enrolled him in a private school with an extended afternoon program . " I felt strongly that he should be in a place where he would get a lot of personal attention , " says Judy , 38 . " If we had more children , we could n't afford to do this . " Sharon Zumberg , 31 , who works for a publishing company in Detroit , lives in fear that her $150-a-week baby-sitter might quit . " I just do n't know what I 'd do without her , " she says . " The price is well worth it . " Although government and industry have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dual role of women can take its toll on advancement in the job market . In San Francisco , single mother Ila Fisher , who works nights as a cocktail waitress , has been fired from three jobs in the past 18 months because of problems in finding reliable baby-sitters for her 2-year-old son . In the professional world , taking off several years to have children or working shorter hours than men can exclude women from the fast track to success . Yet there are indications that many women are successfully combining work and a family . Research on female lawyers found that the most content were those with ostensi- bly the most stress : Married women who were partners in large firms and who also were mothers of small children . " There is a red-herring quality to much of the discussion about what costs there are when women assume roles held primarily by men . Many women are doing it very well , " says Cynthia Fuchs Epstein , sociologist at the City University of New York . ON THE WHOLE , women are healthier than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women moved into the workplace they would increase their risk of heart attacks , midlife breakdowns and shortened life spans ? have not been borne out . Women still have about half the risk of developing the nation 's leading killer , heart disease , that men do . Over all , the longevity gap between the sexes appears to be widening . Latest figures show that females born today can expect to live 78.2 years , compared with 70.8 years for males ? an increase in the feminine advantage of nearly a year since 1960 . Studies show that women 's mental health has also improved . Sociologists at the Wellesley College Center for Research on Women found that the incidence of depression in women age 35 to 55 has declined dramatically in the last 10 years . Thriving in the workplace . According to many researchers , working has had a positive effect on women ? more significant to good health than being married or raising children . " Employment has by far the largest and most consistent ties to good health , " says social demographer Lois Verbrugge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? parenthood a weak third . Stresses from jobs and from coordinating family and work roles certainly exist , but they are offset by the health-promoting aspects of work and careers . " While men die at earlier ages , studies show that women have more ? but less serious ? medical problems . Women go to the doctor more frequently , take more prescription drugs and report more symptoms of emotional stress . " Women have a tremendous biological advantage over men , " explains Prof. Estelle Ramey of Georgetown University Medical School . " Even though women suffer more , they last longer . " In many ways , the changed role of women is rooted in medical advances . The contraceptive pill , introduced in 1960 , is currently used by 9.9 million American women . In addition , 23 million couples use other forms of contraception . This has given women more freedom to pursue careers during the early childbearing years . Since 1960 , the birth rate has been halved . Women today have on average 1.8 children each , compared with 3.7 in 1960 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968 to 35 percent in 1980 . The number of women in their 30s having their first child jumped from 54,198 in 1970 to 145,660 in 1981 . These new trends have focused attention on the special medical needs of women . Postponing the age of first pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of fertility disorders ? stimulating research into overcoming infertility . Procedures such as ultrasound , amniocentesis and fetal monitoring that assess the health of the unborn child have helped cut infant death rates by more than half and reduced maternal mortality by 75 percent since 1960 . Meanwhile , the women 's movement has led to major changes in health care . As a result of the trend toward " natural childbirth , " many hospitals have special rooms where a woman can have her baby delivered by a nursemidwife with the father present . The treatment of breast cancer , which strikes 115,000 women a year , also has changed . A decade ago , it was common to remove totally any breast diagnosed as cancerous . Now , doctors are performing less-disfiguring surgery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consulting with patients on a range of therapies such as radiation and drugs . Changing field . A key factor in the new focus on women 's health has been the rise in the number of female physicians . The number of women **26;644;TOOLONG has nearly tripled since 1970 . " Women have had a great impact , " says **25;672;TOOLONG Keith Russell of Los Angeles . " Pretty soon , our profession will be equally divided between men and women . " Despite all the improvement in women 's health , major problems remain . Sexual abuse , once considered a taboo topic , is a prime example . The Federal Bureau of Investigation notes that reports of  | rape have increased 51 percent since 1973 . The actual number , say officials , is probably higher because many victims are reluctant to report attacks . And 85 percent of sexually abused children are female . For many women , smoking threatens to increase the incidence of certain diseases . The National Cancer Institute notes that 1984 is the first year that lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major concern to older women is osteoporosis , or bone thinning , which accounts for 200,000 hip fractures a year and 3.8 billion dollars in medical care and lost work time . Nevertheless , researchers are generally optimistic that the outlook for women will improve over the next decade . All in all , they say , the new roles that have opened up to women on the job and in the home have been good for health and emotional well-being . AS WOMEN MOVE out of the kitchen and into the workplace in ever increasing numbers , men are having to change , cope and adapt both at home and in the office . Those changes have not been painless on either front , but inflation with its spiraling living costs and then recession with layoffs and high unemployment made a working wife an absolute necessity for economic survival in many households ? and the admission ticket to a much better lifestyle in others . To experts such as Joseph Pleck , a clinical psychologist at Wellesley College Center for Research on Women , the main arena of change has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance of the wife 's employment plus a willingness to share household duties . While women still shoulder most of the burden of taking care of house and children , a recent study found that men today are at home an average of 12 to 14 more hours per week than they were in 1965 . " The main conclusion is that men are spending more time caring for their children and doing housework than ever before , " says Pleck . A nationwide telephone survey of 680 couples found that marriages are shifting toward more-equitable relationships in which both spouses work and share household duties . According to the study , the incidence of depression was lowest for men as well as women in such marriages . In contrast , the marriages with highest depression rates for men and women were those in which the wife had to work ? neither she nor her husband wanting her to ? and also had to do all the housework and child care . " In adapting to the wife 's employment , the central problem for husbands seems to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or apprehension associated with the wife 's employment , " conclude the survey 's authors , John Mirowsky and Catherine Ross of the University of Illinois . " For wives , the central problem is getting the husband to share the housework . " Wellesley 's Pleck notes that middle-class liberal males often have a tougher time adjusting their behavior to the new reality , while conservative blue-collar workers frequently can make the change more smoothly because they have no choice . Divorce has also had an impact . With the trend toward joint custody and the resurgence of fathers ' rights in divorce settlements , more men are discovering as single parents their " soft side " and assuming more responsibility for children . To some observers , it 's not the home but the labor market where men show the greatest resistance to women . Notes author Anthony Astrachan , who is working on a book about men 's attitudes : " There is certainly opposition to women in traditionally masculine fields of work . Men find it a bit easier to accept change at home than at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male bastions , such as the docks , police stations , judges ' chambers and executive suites , are getting their share of women . Breaking down gender barriers on the job is not easy . To hire women for the Los Angeles Fire Department , the city spent $250,000 to set up a special gymnasium and training program so that women could meet stringent requirements for physical strength . Out of 59 candidates , two are now on duty . The 8-year-old daughter of rookie Joanne Cameron brags about " my mother the fireman . " After an initial adjustment period , the female firefighters are well accepted by their colleagues ? in part because the city 's goal was " to raise women to the standards rather than lower the standards for women , " says Fire Commissioner Ann Reiss Lane . In medicine , the recent increase in female physicians has unsettled many in that traditionally male profession . Dr. Halsted Holman , a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine , notes that women doctors are particularly popular with other women and with younger and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seen as a competitive threat , especially in community practice where there may be a surplus of doctors . " Little girl , " the judge said . In the courts , despite the prominence of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , women as lawyers and witnesses still face condescending behavior from males . Last year , a male Brooklyn judge was formally censured for referring to a lawyer as " little girl . " Yet there are indications that male attitudes are changing . Jeanne Conway , director of ITT Corporation 's employe-assistance program , serving 270,000 workers and their families , says that men today are much more willing to seek help with their problems from her . The older ones frequently come in at the suggestion of their wives , while younger men do so on their own . Many men work things out and successfully integrate work with home life . Harvard historian Donald H. Bell , husband of a psychotherapist who works late hours , says he often cuts his workday short to pick up children ? in addition to cleaning house and preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nightline " news program , took a year out of his career to stay home with the children while his wife went  | to law school . For many others , adjusting roles to cope with the new woman has been more troublesome . " We were programed by parents into believing that the male was the breadwinner . His job was top priority , " notes Rabbi Harvey Fields of Los Angeles , whose wife recently launched a career as a stockbroker . " He was the senior partner ; she was the junior partner . But the curtain has fallen on those old assumptions , and it 's painful and bewildering . " THE NEW WOMEN of the 1980s are slowly showing up in books , films and television shows , appearing as wage earners and family heads instead of as stereotypical bumbling housewives , frustrated man chasers and sexual vamps . Gone are the days when Debbie Reynolds , starring in " The Tender Trap " in 1955 , could say : " Do n't you think a man is the most important thing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been married and had children . " Today , people flock to movies such as " Norma Rae , " in which Sally Field plays a labor organizer . In " Yentl , " Barbra Streisand portrays a woman who wants to be judged by her brains . " Silkwood , " starring Meryl Streep and Cher , shows the life of two factory workers . The film " 9 to 5 " focuses on sex discrimination in the office world of secretaries and bosses . Television roles , too , have undergone evolutionary ? but not revolutionary ? change . In the 1950s , the most memorable woman character was the often silly housewife portrayed by Lucille Ball in " I Love Lucy . " In the 1970s came the single working woman played by Mary Tyler Moore . In the 1980s , there is " Cagney and Lacey , " a story about two women police officers ? one married and one single . So popular is the series that CBS 's cancellation of the show last year was reversed following a public outcry . Dramas such as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miniseries " V " feature assertive women who are not content with tending to hearth and home or catching and keeping a man . Instead , they are doctors , lawyers and military commanders . TV 's image of female In literature , a new generation of highly regarded novelists has emerged J. that includes Alice Walker , who writes tellingly about the lives of black women , and Rosellen Brown , whose themes include politics and the family . Poet and novelist Erica Jong , who presented ter , a liberated woman 's view of sex in Fear of Flying , has a new novel coming out that deals with the problems of women who " have careers , babies and men in their lives and are very puzzled about how to fit all these things in . " Says she : " The feminist movement made our ideas important for the first time . " In both the book and film industries , the rise of a number of women to influential executive positions has helped bring about some of the changes . Sherry Lansing , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Twentieth Century Fox and now a film producer , notes that " women influence the way films are made in every studio . Out of that come more multifaceted roles for women . " Despite gains by females on the business side , final decisions on launching projects still are made mostly by men less sensitive to the way women are portrayed and less willing to put up money for a venture with a feminist slant . Barney Rosenzweig , executive producer of " Cagney and Lacey , " contends that television networks are basically cautious and do n't like to lead the way . " They like to mirror society ? and are most comfortable mirroring it from way back in the parade , " he says . Doing their own thing . Actress Marsha Mason points out that major female stars such as Streisand , Jane Fonda and Goldie Hawn had to form their own production companies to create " Yentl , " " 9 to 5 " and " Swing Shift , " a movie about how women went to work in factories during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lack of what she felt were good female parts . " I became tired of being offered roles as either a mother or the love interest , " she explains . " My life and those of the women I know are more complicated than that , but the roles have not caught up with the times we live in . " A survey of TV shows from 1969 to 1978 by University of Pennsylvania researchers found that most dramas presented a world in which men outnumber women 3 to 1 and where marriage , romance and family issues dominate female concerns . Queens College sociologist Gaye Tuchman , a visiting scholar at Stanford University 's Center for Research on Women , argues that TV characterizes women s was once the as " unidimensional " people who lack warmth . Lucy . " Even in the critically admired " Hill Street Blues " series , women run into trouble . After promoting Sgt. Lucy Bates to replace the late Michael Conrad , who played the roll-call sergeant , producers reassigned her next season ? giving the roll-call job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in films , books and television is making money . As women 's roles evolve , so will their images in popular culture ? in order to appeal to an ever larger segment of the audience . Such TV shows as " Cagney and Lacey " are popular because they attract affluent and educated women between ages 25 and 54 , and that lures advertisers . Says David Poltrack , vice president for research at CBS : " If you can do a show that appeals to that audience in large numbers , then you will have a successful show . "
