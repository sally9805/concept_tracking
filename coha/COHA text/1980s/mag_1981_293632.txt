Grosses keep growing on Broadway , but so do expenses <P> Question : In today 's theater , what keeps swelling like a star 's ego ? <P> Answer : Broadway grosses . More people are buying tickets , and paying more for them , than ever before . <P> As theater folk welcome Nicholas Nickleby to help launch the new season , they can look back on the 1980-81 year and pat their pocketbooks with pride . Attendance was 11 million , up 15% from the record-breaking year before , and box-office receipts tallied $196.9 million , almost quadruple those of the 1969-70 doldrums . A new generation of out-of-town and foreign visitors who love New York also love the New York theater ; one-fourth of Broadway ticket buyers are from outside the metropolitan area . A new generation of entertainment consumers , attracted by television commercials , half-price tickets made available on the day of the performance , and the ease of ordering by phone , has developed the Broadway habit , presaging financial health for years to come . <P> For the eighth straight year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70s slump - the Great White Way is coated with happy black ink . <P> Even so , the custodians of the inkwell-the producers , directors and theater owners-disagree noisily over just how successful Broadway is , and what that success means . Bernard Jacobs , who with his partner Gerald Schoenfeld helped restore to grandeur the venerable Shubert Organization - and with it much of Broadway-sees a cloud in the silver lining . " As grosses increase , " says Jacobs , " so do costs . Move the decimal point over a few digits , and you 're in the same place you were 54 years ago . " In 1927 , he notes , a straight play could be produced for $10,000 to $40,000 and a musical for $35,000 to $70,000 . Last year it cost $450,000 to bring Lanford Wilson 's Fifth of July to Broadway ; and Ballroom , Michael Bennett 's intended successor to A Chorus Line , was a $2 million flop - figures that help explain the dizzying rise in ticket prices ( see chart ) . <P> Producer-Director Hal Prince attributes Broadway 's boffo box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moneymen tend to become cautious when they see how huge the profit is with those shows - and how big a gamble trying anything else is . " Producer Alexander H. Cohen puts it another way : " Broadway is too successful . Hit shows are running longer , and there are fewer theaters available than in the past . That makes for a major booking squeeze . With space at a premium , the theater owners may soon be closing shows that are making a profit in order to make way for shows that might do better . There will be no room for the modest success . But let 's face it : Broadway is a business . Making bucks is the bottom line .
