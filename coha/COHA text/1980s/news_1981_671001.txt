Mr. Innis , who was accused of severely beating a man , pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault in the first degree . Aides of Mr. Innis said they saw the man stealing a radio from one of the organization ' s cars in Harlem. // In a recent interview , Mr. Innis , 47 years old , characterized the arrest as part of a continuing conspiracy by Federal , state and local officials to discredit CORE because of its independent , black nationalist posture. // " I am a serious economic and political and cultural black nationalist , " he said . " America could stomach a cultural nationalist . They could stomach one that dabbled in political nationalism but who was impractical in his implementation , or one that talked about economic nationalism but had impractical dreams about it. // " But one who was sharp , intelligent , rational and not playing games is a different story . " <> <> Former Leaders Critical // Some community leaders , elected officials and others , however , maintain that under Mr. Innis ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a pioneer among civil-rights organizations but now exists only to support Mr. Innis and a small group of followers. // These critics said that CORE , one of whose former leaders accused Mr. Innis of destroying the organization ' s " good name " in " pursuing a course of violence , corruption and compromise , " was in no way a national force . They said it could point to few , if any , real accomplishments or programs in the 13 years that Mr. Innis has led the group. // For example , T. Willard Fair , president of the Urban League in Miami , challenged Mr. Innis ' s assertion that CORE was involved in a project of tutoring Haitian refugees and helping to rebuild the area of Miami that was ravaged by riots last year. // " On a scale of one to ten , with one being the lowest , I ' d give CORE a zero in Miami , " Mr. Fair said . His assessment of the organization ' s activities was shared by elected officials and community leaders in other cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re not doing anything , " Mr. Fair said . " There was a chapter of CORE organized in the post-riot period , but I see no one at the CORE office until such time as there is a newsworthy incident in this community . Then Roy or someone comes to town for a brief moment to have a press conference. " // Mr. Innis maintained , however , that CORE was operating what he called a " people ' s self-help center " in Miami with the help of the Worldwide Church of God , a funamentalist Christian sect. // Roy Innis took over CORE in 1968 , and completely changed the course of the previously integrationist group , which was founded by James Farmer in 1941 . Before Mr. Innis took over , CORE pioneered nonviolent civil disobedience , jail-ins , mass arrests and school boycotts throughout the United States . Mr. Innis , on the other hand , befriended Idi Amin , then president of Uganda , and encouraged African heads of state to recruit black American military veterans to fight against South Africa . In 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as " combat medics " in the Angolan conflict. // Mr. Innis said the " conspiracy against CORE " began in 1978 after he announced a plan to develop an economic program with Arab states . The conspiracy , he said , has included a lawsuit against CORE by former leaders of the organization , investigations into the group ' s fund-raising practices by the Attorney General of New York and other states and other investigations or inquiries by the Internal Revenue Service , the Federal Labor Department and the Immigration Service . <> <> ' Besmirch My Image ' // In addition , he said , police officers illegally entered CORE ' S Park Avenue headquarters last December after receiving a report that there were men inside with guns . A judge in Criminal Court later dismissed the case against a man who had been charged with possession of a weapon in the incident , on the grounds that the police had trespassed and had illegally searched a briefcase in CORE ' s office. // CORE has filed a lawsuit charging a conspiracy by the city , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORE building at 1916 Park Avenue to take away ownership of the building from the organization. // " The whole idea is to besmirch my image and reputation , " Mr. Innis said , adding that to do so was intended to destroy the organization. // The New York State Attorney General obtained a preliminary injunction in April 1979 barring CORE from soliciting public contributions . In December of that year , the state charged the organization with disregarding that order . The state accused CORE and its officers of defrauding the public by collecting for services to the poor that the organization did not provide . Instead of using money to assist the poor , the state said , CORE ' s officers used it for trips to Europe and Africa , prizefight tickets and living expenses for themselves and theirwives . <> <> Budget of $500 , 000 // A spokesman for the Attorney General said this week that the injunction had been lifted about a year ago and that a court referee had recommended earlier this year that CORE not be found in contempt . A judge has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman added that discussions were now underway under court auspices to determine if a settlement were possible . Mr. Innis said the discussions were aimed at forming an agreement in which CORE ' s fundraising procedures would be outlined and the organization would agree to abide by them. // Mr. Innis refused to discuss the size of his membership , saying that no " general " describes " the size of his army to the enemy . " He said that the nonprofit , tax-exempt organization had a budget of slightly more than $500 , 000 - a dramatic decrease from its $4 million budget in 1976 - and that the organization was supported primarily through direct contributions by about 50 , 000 people around the country. // CORE ' s programs and projects , he said , include its own elementary schools in New York City and Memphis , on-the-job training in which inexperienced workers are integrated into CORE ' s staff , prison reform and job referral . CORE ' s current " No. 1 program , " he said , involves solving the case of Atlanta ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to Atlanta and declared that he had a " link " that was the key to solving some of the murders . But the information did not pan out . <> <> Leader Is ' Misunderstood ' // " I have not seen CORE do anything in Atlanta , " said Julian Bond , a Georgia State Senator . " As far as I know , there is no CORE presence here . If there is , they are awfully quiet about what they do . Its sole purpose , as far as I can tell , is to raise money. " // CORE supporters , however , view the organization as an important entity in improving the situation of blacks . Queen Mother Moore , a longtime black activist in Harlem , said : " It is very important that we have an organization such as CORE that is militant , progressive and consistent. " // But even some of its supporters are hard-pressed to point to specific , ongoing programs . The Rev. Robert Kinlock , director of the Martin Luther King Freedom Association for Community Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , decent type of individual " who had been " misunderstood . " Mr. Kinlock said that he had worked with Mr. Innis often in the past two years in organizing communities in several cities around various projects , but that he knew of no current programs of the organization. // He said also that he had been a member of CORE in the past but no longer belonged . When asked why , he replied that it was " something I wouldn ' t like to comment on " and that it was " hard when talking about CORE. " // " You can sit down and give an interview about the N.A.A.C.P. , the Urban League , and you can talk freely and clearly , " he said , referring to the nation ' s largest civil-rights groups. // When pressed on his concern about discussing CORE , Mr. Kinlock said : " I don ' t know in what other term to put it but to say that when a person is right , you support them . When you don ' t feel like some organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything at all. " //
