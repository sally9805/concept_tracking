" Season to taste " is a cooking phrase that seems to puzzle most people . Even experienced cooks seemingly do not know what " season to taste " or " adjust the seasonings " mean . The phrases imply more than one might think . Most people do not know that seasonings are spices , not herbs . Herbs are usually leaves ; spices basically are substances such as roots , barks and seeds . THE THREE BASIC SPICES Salt usually is the first seasoning cooks grab when a recipe calls for seasoning . Pepper probably is the next most frequently used spice in western cooking . Few people would guess that nutmeg is third . When a dish tastes flat , most professionals consider these three spices  --  first , salt , then pepper and nutmeg . If any other spices or herbs were significant in a recipe , these also would be considered . OTHER SPICE GROUPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER FAMOUS GROUPS OF SPICES . LUCKILY , THERE ARE FEW ; SO IT IS EASY TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEM . FRENCH MARKETS SELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A COMBINATION OF GROUND PEPPER , CLOVES , NUTMEG AND GINGER . THE PROPORTIONS ARE 2 TEASPOONS OF GROUND PEPPER AND 1/4 TEASPOON EACH OF CLOVES , NUTMEG AND GINGER . THIS MIXTURE IS MOST COMMONLY USED FOR PATES AND IS EQUALLY GOOD ON A MEATLOAF OR HAMBURGER . IT IS FOR GENERAL SEASONING AND FOR SOME COULD BE A GOOD SALT SUBSTITUTE . THE MOST COMMONLY USED DESSERT SPICES ARE ALLSPICE ( WHICH IS NOT A COMBINATION OF SPICES , ALTHOUGH IT TASTES LIKE ONE , THUS ITS NAME ) , CINNAMON ( ALSO USED IN SAVORY DISHES ) , CLOVES , GINGER , MACE ( WHICH IS HUSK AROUND THE NUTMEG ) AND NUTMEG . ALL THESE SPICES ALSO APPEAR IN SAVORY DISHES . IN CHINESE COOKING THE EQUIVALENT OF " FOUR SPICES " IS " FIVE SPICES , " ALSO AVAILABLE PREMIXED : SZECHWAN PEPPER , CLOVES , FENNEL , STAR ANISE AND CINNAMON . THESE ARE THE MAIN SPICES , WHICH MAY BE USED SINGLY OR IN OTHER COMBINATIONS IN COOKING . THERE ARE MANY OTHER IMPORTANT SPICES , BUT COOKS WHO HAVE THE BASIC ONES ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USING SPICES Perhaps the most important thing to know about spices is that they should not be bought in large quantities or kept too long . It usually is better not to buy them preground ; they lose strength quickly . I reserve a small electric coffee grinder for grinding spices . If I also used it for coffee , the flavors would clash unless I cleaned the grinder thoroughly after each use , and I don ' t have time for that . Keeping spices is similar to keeping herbs : Store spices in a dark , cool place . Dark bottles are helpful but not necessary . DOES A DISH NEED SEASONING ? The first problem in adjusting seasoning is to decide whether the dish needs help . A quick taste even of a never-before-tasted dish will tell whether the dish has zing . Does it taste good ? If it doesn ' t , a good cook goes to work . According to chef/teacher Jacques Pepin , a recipe is only an attempt to re-create a taste . A recipe never should be repeated exactly because the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , no tomatoes are the same ; even the taste of two carrots can vary quite a bit . The taste of salt varies if the salt comes from different sources . For instance , salts mined in mountains or taken from the sea may differ because they have the slight taste of other minerals . Cooks should start adjusting almost from the beginning , drawing on memory of how the dish should taste . If tomatoes are out of season , they use more or add a tablespoon of tomato paste . If tarragon is old and has little bouquet , they double or triple the amount used . But often we cook a dish we never have tried before . So how do we know how it should taste ? We don ' t , but a good cook can make a good , educated guess . THE TWO TYPES OF COOKING Basically there are two types of cooking , honest cooking and masking cooking . These are my terms , and I do not mean that one is better than the other . Most cuisines embrace both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . For instance , a chicken dish should taste primarily of chicken and only be complemented by the sauce . This is usually the trend in western cooking . Masking cooking is just the opposite . A sauce or a secondary element is used that dominates or masks the flavor of the main food being cooked . A good example is a Chinese fish served with a soy-sauce-based sauce . The primary taste will be the sauce . The delicate flesh of the fish is a medium for it . This sort of cooking is found in Mexico , India and parts of China , usually hot countries where foods spoil quickly . The late Adele Davis , who might be called the original popularizer of the health food movement , said that America was discovered because of spoiled meat . In looking for a new route to India the ambitious explorers were seeking more efficient spice routes . And the spices were needed to mask the flavor of aging meats and poultry because of the lack of cold storage . Those trying to decide how an untried dish should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a western dish the main taste is what is being cooked , then what is complementing it , if anything , and the taste should be good . HOW TO JUDGE WHAT TO ADD Deciding what to add can be complicated ; it requires experience , but here are guidelines . Let ' s take an easy , Greek egg-lemon soup , a very simply dish that can be ecstatic . As with most simple dishes , it requires good , basic ingredients . Every shortcut in quality means a loss of good taste . A good chicken stock is the first requirement . I look for a good taste of chicken only , complemented by a hint of aromatic vegetables  --  carrot , celery , onion and bouquet garni . If the stock does not have enough chicken taste , I have the choice of adding some reduced chicken stock , if available ; adding a cube of chicken bouillon , such as Knorr ( imported only ) ; cooking the stock longer , adding more chicken parts if available ; boiling the stock down to concentrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock has been degreased , I proceed with the recipe . Once the soup is made , I taste again for the major elements : The chicken taste still should come through ; so should a nice flavor of fresh lemon juice . I begin to season at this point , adding salt little by little , stirring and tasting . At a certain point the flavors will come alive ; beyond it , the soup will taste salty . Next , I add pepper similarly . It is more elusive ; so the pepper should barely taste . Finally , I add nutmeg . Only a dash of fresh grated nutmeg is needed . The spice should not really taste ; it should enhance the taste of chicken and lemon . If the soup still tastes uninteresting , another tablespoon or so of lemon juice may be needed . THE ROLE OF SALT I first look for the proper amount of salt in a dish . Salt is controversial , but those who cook most things from scratch probably have little to worry about . It is all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory-prepared foods that does us in . Those who can not use salt must depend on stronger and better tastes of basic ingredients  --  for example , much more chicken in the stock , a bit more lemon in the soup . In a demonstration class recently , many were on salt-restricted diets , which became obvious from the gasps and whispers when I added even minor amounts of salt . But one woman said in a loud voice while eating , " Why , I can ' t even taste the salt ! " I don ' t believe she knew what a compliment that was . One should not taste the salt ; salt should just bring up the flavors . That ' s what seasoning is mainly about . GREEK EGG-LEMON SOUP Four to six serving Preparation time : 10 minutes Cooking time : 30 minutes 1 quart good chicken stock 1/4 cup raw long-grained rice 2 whole eggs 1 lemon , juiced ; you may want more Salt , pepper , nutmeg to taste 1 tablespoon minced parsley 1 . Heat the stock to a boil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. 2 . Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are light and frothy ; add the lemon juice and stir. 3 . Slowly pour 1 cup of the hot soup into the egg-lemon mixture , stirring constantly until well-mixed . Add more soup , stirring , until the egg-lemon mixture is well-warmed . It is best to do this slowly. 4 . Add the egg-lemon mixture to the rest of the soup , stirring . Taste the soup and add salt , pepper and nutmeg as desired . Ladle into bowls , sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately . Note : The soup may be reheated , but it never is as good . To reheat , bring it almost to the boiling point , but do not boil , as the egg will curdle . The soup also may be served at room temperature , preferably without the rice .
