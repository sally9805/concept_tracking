He is the man most wanted by drug-enforcement officials in Bolivia . Yet to some of his countrymen , Roberto Suarez Gomez , 53 , sometimes known as the King of Cocaine , is a folk hero , portraying himself as a modern Robin Hood to Bolivians disillusioned by years of official corruption . In their book , Bolivia : Coca Cocaina , Authors Amado Canelas Orellana and Juan Carlos Canelas Zannier say that Suarez 's popularity springs from the fact that his wealth originated " in the depravity of the Yanquis ( drug abuse in the U.S. ) and not in the robbing of the coffers of the state . " <P> Indeed , Suarez is said to be a great benefactor . A wealthy cattleman with vast lands in Bolivia 's Beni region , he reportedly has underwritten most of the education costs for an entire district and regularly provides technical or college education abroad for young people in the area . Little wonder , then , that when Suarez had appendicitis two years ago , he was able to slip into the hospital in Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivia 's Oriente region , for treatment . " The authorities were searching for him , " explains one of Suarez 's friends , " but the whole town conspired to protect him . " <P> The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration believes it was in the mid-1970s that Suarez first realized the fabulous profits that could be made from coca . As an expert pilot with a fleet of planes , acquired to transport beef from his isolated ranches , he was able , so the story goes , to become a long- distance middleman between Bolivian coca growers and Colombian buyers , shipping the leaves to processing plants . <P> By 1980 , DEA intelligence reports estimated that Suarez 's coca operations were earning him $400 million a year . In an effort to catch him , U.S. antinarcotics forces launched one of the most elaborate sting operations in the DEA 's history . A dozen agents posed as underworld financiers and traffickers . By purchasing $9 million worth of coca paste , they lured two alleged Suarez associates to Miami for the payoff  --  and arrested them . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Miami federal grand jury : so far , however , he has eluded his pursuers . He has also repeatedly denied any involvement in the drug trade and calls himself " an agro-industrial entrepreneur . " <P> In 1982 , Suarez 's son , Roberto Jr. , also wanted in connection with the sting , was arrested in Switzerland for carrying a false passport . He was subsequently extradited to Miami  --  Suarez maintains that he was kidnaped  --  to stand trial for cocaine trafficking . In response , the elder Suarez published an open letter to President Reagan in the La Paz daily El Diario , offering to turn himself in on two conditions : his son be released and the U.S. pay off Bolivia 's entire foreign debt . The issue became academic when a Miami federal jury acquitted Roberto Jr . <P> The Suarez legend continues to grow in Bolivia , even if many of the stories told about him are probably wildly exaggerated . He has been seen carrying a gold-plated handgun and keeps a pet leopard , said to wear a gold collar studded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beni . In interviews with journalists , Suarez has boasted that he has hired Libyan " experts " to train his security force and that his ranchland retreats are defended by missile-carrying aircraft . He also likes to buy newspaper space to lecture his countrymen on the corruption in their government .
