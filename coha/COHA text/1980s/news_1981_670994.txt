Peyser of Westchester County said today that he had reliable information that additional cuts of as much as $2 billion would be sought in the Title I program at the behest of David A. Stockman , President Reagan ' s budget director . <> <> Peyser Sees ' Double-Dealing ' // Mr. Peyser accused the White House of " double-dealing " in trying to go beyond the cuts that Mr. Reagan won last month in the budget reconciliation fight with Congress. // Administration officials denied the accusation of " doubledealing " and denied that Title I had been specifically targeted . But the officials emphasized // The Administration is trying to reassure economists that its efforts to check Federal spending are enough to calm the financial markets , Page D1. <> that billions of dollars in precise savings remained to be enacted for 1982 .

Those goals , Mr. Dale said , requested a total education budget of $13. 1 billion in appropriations. // The reconciliation measure adopted by Congress authorized an education budget of $15. 7 billion , but Administration officials said that this only set a " cap , " or spending ceiling , and that their true goal remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Assistant Secretary of Education for legislation and public affairs , said the lower goal had been emphasized in numerous conversations and dealings with Congress through the authorization process . <> <> Remedial Education Threatened // She also said she did not yet know details of the appropriations to be sought in various programs but noted that the original goal was for a Title I program no higher than $2. 8 billion , or more than $600 million less than the ceiling authorized last month. // " These have been the numbers and they remain so at this point , " she said . Mr. Peyser contended that sizable cuts below the Title I ceiling of $3. 48 billion threatened the heart of remedial education programs for inner-city children . The authorization ceiling represented a cut of $500 million over what it would have been under the previous levels , he said , adding that anything drastically lower would harm programs that now serve 6. 3 million children. // " The important factor here is that we can ' t trust the top levels of the Administration , " Mr. Peyser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask.
