The headline on the New York Post screamed U.S. APPROVES HERPES SUPER-DRUG . While that description was exaggerated , the approval of oral acyclovir capsules last week by the Food and Drug Administration marked a big step forward in the treatment of genital herpes . Though the drug will not cure the pesky venereal disease , which afflicts some 5 million to 20 million Americans , it can reduce both the severity and the frequency of recurring attacks . <P> Acyclovir , developed by the Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle Park , N.C. , works against herpes infections by inhibiting the ability of the virus to replicate . In 1982 the company was given permission to market the drug in the U.S. in two forms , both under the name Zovirax .

In the absence of any long-term studies , it has limited daily use of the capsules to six months and has warned against their use during pregnancy . Also , the agency noted , use of the capsules does not guarantee that a herpes victim will not infect a sexual partner . <P> When Zovirax becomes available in mid-February , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsules will cost from $15 to $18 ; the tag for six months of use will be a hefty $360 .
