Her query found an appropriate quarry . After years as a singer , songwriter and producer for his own records and for such artists as Barbra Streisand , Mr. Holmes felt restless . There had to be more to music , he reasoned , than being remembered for a No. 1 hit entitled " Escape ( The Pina Colada Song ) . " // But when it came to writing a musical , Mr. Holmes was a beginner . He had only one idea , and it dated from the time he was 9 years old . " In our house , " he recalled , " we had one of those complete sets of Dickens you can buy by the yard to fill up your bookshelves . And the last one was ' The Mystery of Edwin Drood . ' I remember my father telling me , ' You know , it ' s not a mystery like " Tower Treasure " or one of those , ' and that it was never finished . That haunted me , the idea Dickens never finished it. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical , " The Mystery of Edwin Drood . " The playful evocation of Dickens runs at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park through Sunday and is to reopen Dec. 2 on Broadway . With " Edwin Drood , " Mr. Holmes has become the second popular songwriter this year to successfully cross over into show music - the other being Roger Miller , who won a Tony Award for his score for " Big River , " his first musical . <> <> Wrote the Book Also // Mr. Holmes , though , was not satisfied with writing music and lyrics in his maiden attempt at a musical ; he decided to do the book as well . He pasted Miss Merrifield ' s note on his typewriter and began writing a synopsis of Dickens ' s unfinished mystery . In the process , he made many of the choices that shaped the musical ' s final form. // First came the idea of making " Edwin Drood " a multiple-choice musical , in which the audience votes on several matters , including whether Drood is alive or dead and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just thought , how would anyone have the chutzpah to finish what Charles Dickens couldn ' t , " Mr. Holmes recalled . " I thought , well , there doesn ' t have to be the ending . Let the audience end it . If they don ' t like it , they chose it . " Mr. Holmes also decided that the audience should see not simply a musical adaptation of " Edwin Drood " but a musical-within-a-musical - a version of the mystery performed by a fictitious English music-hall troupe . " I wanted ' Drood ' to provide the springboard for the musical in the way ' Hamlet ' provided the springboard for Stoppard in ' Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , ' " Mr. Holmes said . " You go to that play knowing you ' re not seeing ' Hamlet , ' but something suggested by it. " // The music-hall conceit also had two practical aspects . It let Mr. Holmes apply his knowledge of Victorian vaudeville and it coincided with his notion to have a woman ( Betty Buckley , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stock convention of such entertainment . And with a woman in the male lead , Mr. Holmes could indulge his musical fancy , writing a love duet for two sopranos ( Miss Buckley and Patti Cohenour in the current production ) . <> <> Mixed Verdict // In the summer of 1983 , Mr. Holmes laid out his plan to Miss Merrifield and Joseph Papp , the producer of the Shakespeare Festival . The verdict was mixed . " We were interested in Rupert , " Mr. Papp recalled , " but we weren ' t sure the show would work . It was risky . It put a lot of pressure on the audience. " // Miss Merrifield , however , remained a complete ally - and a particularly effective one , since she is married to Mr. Papp . " I didn ' t have to badger Joe about the show , " she said . " I just brought Rupert ' s name up at breakfast every morning. " // Mr. Holmes delivered Act I , all two and a half hours of it , in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the complete show . It ran 3 hours 40 minutes . " I offered to cut one number , " Mr. Holmes said. // In fact , a long process of shaping the work began . Mr. Holmes recognized that his story remained too reverent to Dickens , so he put more emphasis on the vaudeville side . Scenes were shifted from the second act to the first . Two or three songs were cut , as were chunks of explanatory dialogue. // But if Mr. Holmes ' s inexperience with musicals led to some early errors , it also allowed him to invent freely . The second act , for instance , has three straight production numbers with barely any dialogue between , something anathema to most musicals but effective for " Edwin Drood . " <> <> ' Only What Appealed to Him ' // " If he knew then what he knows now about musicals , " said Wilford Leach , the director of " Edwin Drood , " " it wouldn ' t be the same show . Since he didn ' t try to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appealed to him , the show has the signature of a person , not a committee. " // " I didn ' t do this by logic , " Mr. Holmes said . " I just went by , ' Wouldn ' t this be fun. ' " // A number of major actors thought so , very early on . George Rose , who oversees the musical as " Your Chairman , " joined the project for the first staged reading . Other principals , including Miss Buckley and Cleo Laine , took part in the second reading. // " I ' ve known Rupert ' s work for a long time and I ' d always been attracted to his records , " recalled Miss Buckley , who won a Tony Award for her role as Grizabella in " Cats . " " And I ' ve always hoped that pop composers , the better composers from the record marketplace , would write more for the theater . So when I heard Rupert was writing this show , it was like a philosophical obligation to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " opened in the Delacorte after only three weeks of rehearsals , clocking in at close to three hours . Most of the show ' s creative team saw the need for further work on the show but decided to freeze it rather than make major changes during the run . " It was frustrating to see what needed work , " Mr. Papp said . " It was like closing up an operation before you ' re done with the surgery. " // But with the transfer to Broadway three months off , Mr. Holmes says he has time to trim and focus some scenes and to write new orchestrations for several musical numbers. // He is also taking time , in his fretful way , to savor the accomplishment so far . The other day , getting a ride to the theater , Mr. Holmes was nagging the driver about being more careful . The driver asked what the problem was . " I said , ' I really don ' t want to die just now , ' " Mr. Holmes recalled . " Being alive now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
