In other areas of the ice , Normand Leveille of the Bruins puts his head down , dips his shoulder and drives through people like a halfback going for a first down . He usually gets the extra yard . In front of the goal , he has his head up and , without using words , beseeches the man with the puck to pass it . Tom Fergus saw that look last night and passed the puck from the right circle to the front of the goal . Leveille slam-dunked the puck into the goal to give the Bruins their second straight victory of the infant season , 4-3 , over the pesky Pittsburgh Penguins last night at the Garden . It was a victory preserved by goalie Mike Moffat , aided and abetted by his teammates - and by the Penguins . " We should have come right at them in the third period , " said Pittsburgh coach Eddie Johnston . Instead , the Penguins had only three shots at Moffat . " They didn ' t have a lot of high-quality shots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was solid and worked hard and the forwards were coming back , and that scratches everyone ' s back . " It was a difficult game to categorize . It was played in spurts . The Bruins would play strongly , then fall off . Pittsburgh would have its good moments , then suffer lapses . But Bruins coach Gerry Cheevers could say , " We responded to the third-period situation for the second straight game . " The Bruins beat the Hartford Whalers , 5- 4 , Saturday night with a third-period goal . At the beginning , last night ' s game looked easy . There was defenseman Mike Milbury streaming in behind a two-on-one break and knocking a rebound into the goal just 44 seconds after the opening faceoff . " First-minute goals are very bad goals , " said Johnston . " Unless you get them . " Milbury ' s goal came off a Pittsburgh lapse . The Penguins got caught up ice and Randy Hillier sent Brad Palmer and Steve Kasper in against Paul Baxter . Palmer passed right to Kasper . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kasper took his shot , " said Milbury . Kasper backhanded the puck at goalie Denis Herron , who made a good stop at the post . But the puck popped off his body and dropped in the crease . " I almost missed it , " said Milbury . " It flipped up on my stick , " and he knocked it into the goal . Nice and easy : 44 seconds , a 1-0 lead . " Easy games are long and far between in this league . . . It has become so competitive , " said Cheevers . And soon the Penguins tied the game on Randy Carlyle ' s power-play goal . Twice more in the second period the Bruins would get ahead by one and Pittsburgh would tie . Bruce Crowder was the man who put Boston ahead both times . First , he picked up the puck behind the Pittsburgh goal when Leveille kicked it to him , and Crowder came around to the right post . " Rick MacLeish was on me , " said Crowder , " but I guess I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the goal . " Another Pittsburgh power-play goal , this one by Rick Kehoe , equalized that score . " You can ' t go on forever relying on power- play goals , " said Johnston , whose team led the NHL last season in that department . " Pittsburgh has a super power play , " said Cheevers , " one of the best in the game . " Just when you began to wonder why Johnston didn ' t tell his old pal Cheevers his power-play secrets ( the Bruins had gone 0 for 10 ) , Bruce Crowder scored while the Bruins had the manpower advantage for a 3-2 lead . Keith Crowder came out of the penalty box , took two steps onto the Boston bench , and his brother went off the other end , chugging toward the right circle . Barry Pederson had the puck at the top of the left circle . " He gave me a great pass , " said Crowder , who put his shot past Herron ' s left shoulder , over his glove . " I don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Crowder . " I just let the puck find its own holes . " The Penguins tied the score on a Pat Boutette backhander after he cut across to the front of the goal from the left wing . The game went into the third period at 3-3 , and Leveille ' s power-play goal won it . " We seem to respond when we ' re in trouble , " said Cheevers . " You ' ve got to equalize Pittsburgh ' s power play somehow , and we got two . That ' s why we won the game . "
