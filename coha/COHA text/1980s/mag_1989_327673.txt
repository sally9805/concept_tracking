Remember Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz ? Of course not . And Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow ? Of course . But the Scarecrow dancing crazily off fences , being bowled over by a pumpkin and sailing high in the air over the cornfield ? Well . . . <P> In fact , Bolger did perform just such a dance number . And , yes , there was an appearance by Ebsen as the Tin Man . But few have seen these scenes for decades , except for a couple of archivists at MGM and some film fanatics . Now they are finally available for home viewing  --  but not on tape . They can be seen only on the sumptuous laser-disc Criterion edition of The Wizard of Oz . <P> Laser discs ( basically , CDs with movies on them ) may have suffered from consumer confusion in the marketplace . But for film aficionados and filmmakers , from Steven Spielberg to Martin Scorsese , they are the home- viewing medium of choice . With peerless sound and a better picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the fullest justice to their theatrical source material . To make them even more attractive to movie buffs and general viewers , disc producers are offering extras unavailable on tape and often even in theaters , such as Bolger 's full dance number , which never made it into the Wizard , and Ebsen 's brief appearance as the Tin Man . <P> More and more , such delectable morsels are coming to light as interest in laser grows ( distributors predict the laser market will double in sales to $80 million by the end of 1989 ) . But the historical fillips are more than curiosities and commercial come-ons . They make movies resonate with fresh possibilities and new impact . <P> The Criterion Collection , from the Voyager Co. in Santa Monica , Calif. , turns out the most formidable disc library . Its version of Orson Welles ' masterpiece The Magnificent Ambersons contains , among other items , the entire shooting script , a full set of storyboards , and stills of crucial scenes deleted by the studio . The Criterion edition of Blade Runner has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead ; the disc of 2001 was personally . overseen by Stanley Kubrick and includes almost a thousand pages of essays and production memos . " We 're a significant part of an as yet insignificant business , " says Voyager co-founder Robert Stein . But other companies are fast picking up on his lead . MCA 's pristine disc of the Anthony Mann western classic Winchester .73 contains a beguiling chat with the film 's star , James Stewart . And Image 's release of Platoon includes an impressive , intense interview with director Oliver Stone . <P> Voyager has always been scrupulous about releasing wide-screen films in " letter-box " format ( masking the top and bottom of the screen to duplicate the breadth of the theatrical image ) , and this idea too is catching on . MGM is marketing lavish wide-screen editions of Doctor Zhivago and Ben- Hur , and 20th Century Fox will put out the Star Wars trilogy , as well as the recent smash Die Hard , in the full-frame format . Even E.T . was letter- boxed on disc , and Spielberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be in wide screen and contain some 20 minutes of previously deleted smash-and-grab comedy footage . All this feverish cinema archaeology confirms that laser disc is not only the best way to see movies but also the best way to see a lot more of them .
