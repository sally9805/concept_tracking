S T OR Y INSULATION By Rick DeMarinis Iam haunted by lightning . When the sky is streaked with jagged blue flame , when the blue-white tongues fork the earth , when the deep-throated anvils or hammerheads drift their weightless tons over my house , murmuring my name in the oldest language men know , it is time for me to put insulating miles between myself and the weather or dash quickly to the rubberized shed in the backyard . Conductivity runs on my father 's side of the family , reliably leapfrogging the generations . My father himself was not affected by voltage from the sky . My grandfather , however , was lifted out of his Adirondack lawn chair by a furious bolt arcing , literally , out of the blue : no storm , no cloud , no freak manifestation of ionized dust  --  just naked a cappella lightning . The empty windless sky had given him false security as he sat reading the paper in the lovely light of an August afternoon . Grandmother was watching him fondly from the kitchen window as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue shaft , thick as God 's middle finger , lifted him out of a satisfied doze as she watched not in horror but as one might relive the strangeness of a dream , Shock and horror came later , when she found herself in the yard standing at the edge of a burned area in the lawn , grandfather still smoking at the ears and nose , his head a violent shade of vermilion , his hands clutching , with the strength of a strangler , his evening Tribune . Rick DeMannis 's most recent book is The Coming Triumph of the Free World , a collection of stories . Two of the stories originally appeared in Harper 's Magazine . His new novel , The Year of the Zinc Penny , will be published in September by Norton . Grandfather had flown up and over the back of the lawn chair , tossed like a toy , a grim tattoo , coarse and ugly , zigzagging from scalp to the conductive center just above the navel  --  our genetic fault line . I am not superstitious . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a better-than-average university ; I have made my living for twenty-two years by analyzing failure rates for the aerospace industry . I along with three colleagues designed the multipurpose Unplanned Event Record ( UER ) , which is now used universally . But there was a close call last summer , and it changed everything , made me attractive in a way you would not imagine . Now I am preoccupied with insulation . I have had all the tall trees that once surrounded my house cut down . No TV antenna festoons the roof . I wear thick-soled rubber boots , even to church . ( The steeple of our church was demolished by lightning a year ago . A char of skeletal beams points skyward , aspiring hope mutilated in a single , heaven-sent stroke . ) This is the truth we live by : a thousand repetitions of an event give you every right to expect the one thousand and first . This is what lies behind the assuring phrase " laboratory tested . " You rely on it . Your warranties would not be worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is why , despite your romantic longings for a less technically suffocating world , you do not believe in ghosts , mental telepathy , synchronicity , healing crystals , New Age music , or the zodiac . Go to two astrologers on the same day and you are likely to have a head-on collision with yourself on the expressway to confusion . STORY 51 We have a fine new world . It works repeatedly , not in random fits and starts . We have what the ancients only dreamed of : reliability . Chicken guts , crystal balls , tea leaves , tarot cards , I Ching sticks , and drug- or starvation-induced hallucinations do not produce the reliable and specific data required by jumbo-jet pilots , brain surgeons , market analysts , or , for that matter , wheat farmers . Bypass hard knowledge at your own risk . The so-called " right brain " enthusiasts , the gurus of intuition , are simply lazy . They want the shortcut that bypasses the difficult road between cause and effect . But no one gets off this road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark side of the mind where illumination is scant and quirky . Those who travel there soon find themselves lost in the eclipse of reason . I am haunted by lightning , but I believe in reason . I wo n't produce convincing evidence here beyond the inductive argument based on family history . I want to save my life , though it is too late to save Eugenia . Eugenia had come to fear me . If I reached across the breakfast table to touch her hand , she pulled back , goose bumps spreading up her arms . I would see her counting , though she tried to conceal it . I saw the slight , up-and-down ratcheting of her eyes as they numbered the vertical peonies in each panel of wallpaper to distract herself from her fear . A good-bye kiss at the doorstep had become an ordeal for her . Our lips no longer met . We kissed the neutral air . In the bedroom  --  but I am not one to discuss the bedroom . Suffice it to say that when the forecast was bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder . Eugenia had lately evolved rituals for such times that made the traditional Latin mass seem accessible and abrupt . She made the bed seven times , spraying , again and again , the underside of the blankets and sheets with an anti-static aerosol . She stood on a chair and unscrewed the light bulbs , thinking , foolishly , that by disconnecting them from their source she would safeguard the bedroom . For this same reason she unplugged the radios , clocks , and television set . She kept crystals under her pillows . Sometimes they found their way into the bedclothes , where they scratched us . But she would not hear my complaints . A sudden breeze with the smell of rain or ozone in it sent her running . She claimed she could see the fine hair along my upper arms rise up as if from sinister sleep when ordinary unmenacing clouds drifted overhead . She knew  --  to give her credit  --  that she was made up of positive and negative charges . We all are . The universe is . There is nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . The play of human events  --  a phantasmagoria imposed on an electromagnetic field . You knew this , of course . There is nothing more to say about it . When the electron-hungry clouds  --  anvils , hammerheads  --  began to track me down with the same inexorable logic that describes the fall of an apple , Eugenia believed the danger was a consequence of moral fault . She made the sign of the cross before receiving me . Later , she took to wearing rubber electrician 's gloves that reached her elbows . Gum-soled shoes covered her feet . She coated herself from ankles to earlobes with a non-conductive oil , used in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors , that smells vaguely of burning dogwood . I still keep a steel drum of this oil in the garage . The insulation eventually involved the very place of intimate connection . The bolt of passion , needless to say , was often neutralized by such rigorous precaution . I wo n't say more . I have been to famous clinics . They found my blood , bones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ionization , no secret micro-lightning rods wired into my femurs or tibiae . My hair has been studied for excesses of copper , zinc , and iron  --  elements that might seduce electrons out of the sleeping ground . I have been wired to ultrasensitive meters while spinning dynamos were passed over my body , but the indicators did not leap . The doctors advised psychiatry . They ignored the evidence I offered . One hundred years of empirical proof : grandfather in the lawn chair , his grandfather struck down in a pasture . My cousin Priscilla was electrocuted by her telephone during a storm . My eldest brother , Paul , his pacemaker dazzled by a faulty microwave oven , causing his heart to wreck itself with fibrillations ; my young brother Warden dead on the putting green . And of course there 's me : the scalp-tightening sensations whenever a storm gathers , and then the close call of last summer . Evidence . But evidence without theory is noise . I have no theory . Desperate for a theory , I wrote to Doctor Helper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our local paper . I signed my letter " Haunted . " " Dear Haunted , " he replied , " The abnormal fear of lightning is a well-documented phobia . Like the other common phobias  --  fear of the marketplace , fear of heights , fear of confinement  --  it can now be safely attributed to brain-chemistry deficits . Rest assured , you can be cured through appropriate medication . As for your ' evidence ' ? your close call ' ? please , in the future , do not go fishing in aluminum boats . " Idid n't know the boat was aluminum . It was The seats were wood , the gunwales were wood , and the oars were wood . I saw wood , I believed wood . It was my friend Ted Lardner 's boat . I had checked the weather forecasts and there were no thunderstorms within 200 miles . I can not spend my weekends reading technical journals in my rubber shed . I need recreation . I should have realized the boat was not wood by its action in the water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tibet . The bones of the dead are crushed and mixed with yak butter so that scavenging birds will eat the remains and carry them , along with the spirit of the deceased , into the sky . Ted teaches comparative culture at the community college and is endlessly fascinating , but , even so , 1 should have been more conscious of the boat . I caught a fish , then Ted caught a fish . I caught another fish , a trash fish , and then Ted caught a water snake . I saw a terrapin leaving a wake . There were mergansers , fish hawks , and an occasional heron . It was lovely , we had a fine time , and Ted , who makes his own guitars , talked melodiously of how lightning-struck wood is soft and easily worked . It bends cooperatively with applied heat and produces , in the finished product , an incomparable tone . He had his guitar with him , and when we began to believe the fishing would not improve , he strummed and sang . It was idyllic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat . " My guitar speaks , " Ted said . " This is a concert guitar , the back and sides made of struck rosewood , the top of struck cedar . " But there were other voices speaking , and I heard them too late . " Looks like rain , " Ted said . " What ? " I gasped . I swiveled about , rocking the boat . " Boom , boom , " Ted said and strummed , and then I heard it too : thunder filtered through trees and hills . I dropped my pole , heard the gong of metal on metal , and it was then I realized the boat was made of not wood but aluminum . " Jesus , Ted ! " I cried out . I picked up the oars , clambered into the rowing seat , and headed the craft back tothe dock , which looked to be at least two miles away . Even as I bent to my labor , wind wrinkled the lake . The first angry white billow appeared at the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basso profundo roar caromed through the small green valley that held the lake and a few small farms . Unaware of my fear , Ted strummed folk tunes from the I960s while drawing peacefully on his pipe . The last remaining god is weather , someone once said . Clouds are bundles of electrical charges . The earth yearns with free electrons for the upward leap . Overhead the great white muscle of stratocumulus gathered itself toward the lethal flex . The weightless tons drifted silently over us , staining the water dark green . I rowed hard . At last Ted noticed my terror . " Not to worry , old son , " he said blandly . " Lightning Illustration by Gwyn Stramler STORY 53 ca n't strike twice in the same place , or have n't you heard ? " He held his lightning-struck guitar high and grinned . " We 're safe , " he said . " Guaranteed . " " There was fire in your mouth , " Ted said later . ' ' The water glowed so that you could see huge Mackinaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All I remember is the taste of sweet onions , the flavor of lightning . You must survive in order to remember it . however . My brother Warden gave off the smell when he was killed . Jean , his wife , was coming up behind , working her way out of a sand trap . The lightning knocked him sideways , off the green , his putter a black wand in his dead fist . Jean said , " I bent down to give him CPR and smelled onions , but he 'd only had fruit for lunch . " For some reason I had my net in my hand as I rowed . The aluminum frame , I am told , turned into a hoop of fire . The oarlocks were welded to the seats . The oars splintered . The fish we caught were instantly cooked . Brass rivets melted and the boat opened . Ted swam , towing me behind . Though I can not swim , I was extraordinarily calm . I give credit to the strike that had momentarily reorganized my mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back , Ted 's hand gripping my collar , the sky blue and clear again above me as we made our slow way to shore . I believed I was dead and that Charon was towing me across the Styx . This mood stayed with me for a long time . I remember it so vividly that sometimes I believe it is n't a memory but an ongoing condition . " Your jacket filled up with light , " Ted said . " You were a one-man monster movie . " Ted is one of the lucky insulated ones . He can touch exposed house wiring and not feel the thrilling vibration of alternating current . " It was liquid light , " he said . " I thought 1 saw your bones . They were red and alive under your shirt . I saw your heart . " flowed backwards . Eugenia 's hairpins , like a caravan of army ants , followed me out of the bathroom . There is an explanation for everything . This is no idle assertion . It is the philosophy that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my portrait of Newton , is a portrait of Einstein . The thoughtless believe the latter superseded the former . No . The latter , using the same methods , holding the same belief in reason . and guided by the same faith in the certainty of explanation , extended the former . If you lose your belief in explanation , you have lost your mind . Your mind is a representation of a five-century-old trend . What is preparing to replace it offstage , in the wings , grinning in the shadows ? I tremble to think . So should you . One day I will find an explanation for Eugenia 's tragic death . I could not attend her funeral because of my relentless smile . Her relatives might have understood , but in my grief I found it monstrous , a senseless affront . We are electrical . But shall I declare a conspiracy of electrons ? Should I fix blame on the microcosmic field of positive and negative charges ? Should I say my vulgar smile in the face of my loss was arranged by an evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , electrolytic oil , emotional distance . Yet the bolt found her . There was no storm . I admit to anger . A man is entitled to some affection . Yet prolonged contact frightened her . She ran , stumbling in her boots , through the house , from imagined danger . I could not help myself : I thundered . I roared . A man is entitled to some affection . I did not feel attractive , though a mob of paper clips , straight pins , and scraps of foil  --  swarming in the air like gnats when the bright afternoon is cooled by storm clouds  --  followed me as I roared in pursuit . found her in the laundry room , wedged between the washer and dryer . I felt calm , reasonable , prepared to discuss the issue in a rational way , but I knew I was also roaring at her . She looked up at me as if at a had sky . " Eugenia , " I said , but the syllables came out as claps of thunder . Something kicked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue glow that washed over me like a wave and , like a wave , receded . It came from the 220-volt outlet , domestic lightning , wanting me , I believe , but passing through Eugenia en route . I tried to dial 911 but the phones were hot . Storm clouds arrived on the scene , warning me to keep silent , keep insulated , whispering my fate in small cyclones that bent my neighbor 's trees and carried spirals of dust into the darkening air . I have faith that a scientific explanation for these events will soon occur to me. ?
