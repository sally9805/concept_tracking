We were standing in the desert , about 200 miles south of the city of Benghazi in eastern Libya . Suddenly there were hootings and strange , macabre wailing sounds from the Arab women . A convoy of jeeps , flanked by Bedouin tribespeople on horseback , snaked across the horizon . Dust clouds swirled against the setting sun. // // Col. Muammar Qaddafi , bete noir of Ronald Reagan and leader of this revolutionary Arab nation of just under 4 million people , had arrived . Dressed in a grey jump suit and combat boots , the Libyan leader was immediately immersed in the frenzied , chanting crowd. // Part of the Qaddafi style is to do the unexpected , at times the outrageous . Following the United States bombing raid on Libya in April , he dropped out of sight . There was speculation about his health . He was said to be in a state of psychological shock as a consequence of the bombing . Two of his children had been killed and his house - now turned into a national shrine - in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been destroyed. // Yet here was the colonel appearing at a number of carefully stage-managed rallies , as confident and full of bluster as ever . At his first public appearance in Tripoli since the US bombing , he spared no language in condemning President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. // Later , at a surprise appearance at the ' ' nonaligned ' ' nations ' summit in Zimbabwe , Colonel Qaddafi threatened to form his own international army to ' ' spread fire under the feet of America. ' ' // Following the colonel at various orchestrated rallies and parades , however , it was hard to overlook the feeling that something had changed. // At close quarters , the Libyan leader looks dazed and distracted . While very conscious of the foreign media ' s presence - at one stage he delayed the start of a military parade for the arrival of a US film crew - he refused to talk or answer questions , something he had been only too willing to do in the past . His smile seemed wooden , his fist waving mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside , the colonel sat slumped in the back of his open-topped green Cadillac . He looked tired and dejected , a khaki Army hat perched atop his bushy hair. // Since April , Qaddafi has moved restlessly around the country , rarely spending more than a night in any one place . He spends most of his time in the vast desert areas in the south , among the Bedouin , his own people. // ' ' Even here in his own country , he acts like a guerrilla leader , ' ' one resident commented. // Reporting on the elusive , enigmatic colonel is not easy. // Chaos surrounds him and - as his young guards butt and shove with their Kalashnikov rifles - there is danger as well . An Italian cameraman had his arm broken ; another was trampled on by an overly excited horse . A very striking female bodyguard , constantly at the colonel ' s side , made life difficult for an American camera woman. // Gauging popular support for Qaddafi is not easy . But Libyans , generally a warm and relaxed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leader ' s revolutionary ideas. // Qaddafi draws much of his support from the young . A large proportion of Libya ' s population is under 15 years old , and has known no other system than Qaddafi ' s - a system that has brought many benefits , including free medical care and education . These youngsters have also been thoroughly immersed in the ideals of the Libyan revolution. // But there is opposition to Qaddafi . This comes mainly from within the armed forces and among the technocrats , sources say . Qaddafi has made no secret of his resentment of the military , accusing officers of luxurious , unrevolutionary living . There are plans , according to some sources , to abolish the entire military structure and replace it with a people ' s militia. // Promotions and many rankings in the military have already been abolished . Professional soldiers - many of whom have spent training periods abroad - are not keen on the changes. // Some apparently feel that Libya ' s military capabilities will be weakened by such revolutionary moves , particularly if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of sophisticated hardware that Libya has reportedly lately acquired. // There are also doubts about how the fervor of a 2-million strong militia would be maintained. // ' ' Qaddafi ' s revolution is not an Iran-style Islamic revolution , ' ' said one Libyan dissident now living overseas . ' ' So much depends on him and his ideas alone. ' // In the last few months , the entire command of the armed forces , including the Navy , has been moved well away from the urban centers on the coast to Hun , about 280 miles south of Tripoli. // There , in the blistering desert heat , a new headquarters is being built , most of it reportedly by Soviet technicians and workers . Military commanders , accustomed to the more pleasant clime of the Mediterranean coast , are unlikely to be happy in such austere surroundings. // The technocrats have been hurt by the downturn in the Libyan economy . As prices for Libya ' s oil output - at present running an estimated 1. 1 million barrels per day - soared in the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latest technology was imported , while increasing numbers of Libyan students were sent overseas . Oil still accounts for more than 95 percent of Libya ' s foreign exchange earnings . However , as revenues are decreasing , projects are being scaled down or cancelled. // As Libya has become more isolated in international diplomatic circles , many students have been forced to return home . Not all are reportedly happy with what they find. // But Qaddafi and a small group of longtime loyalists still retain overall control , observeres say. // The Libyan leader ' s No. 2 man has emerged in the person of Maj. Abdul Salam Jalloud , who is seen as an immensely able and canny politician , a sound economist , and the person responsible for a more moderate line in some areas of Libyan policy. // Military discontent is meanwhile kept in check by two other Qaddafi loyalists , the chief of staff of the armed forces , Abu Bakr Younis Jaber , and the inspector general of the military , Mustafa Kharroubi. // The question some analysts are asking is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check. // Ironically for Washington , the US bombing seemed to temporarily , at least , increase Qaddafi ' s stature both within Libya and the Arab world. // Qaddafi has always liked drawing similarities between himself and the acknowledged leader of the Arab world in the 1960s , Egypt ' s Gamal Abdel Nasser . More recently , he has taken to comparing himself with the Latin American revolutionary leader , Ernesto ' ' Che ' ' Guevara . However , as he becomes more radical and unpredictable , so does he becomes more isolated - both internally and from the outside world. // There is no doubt , however , that he retains a flair and style all his own . On this day at least , Colonel Qaddafi deserved an Oscar. // //
