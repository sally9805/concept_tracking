IRAs have accomplished what the investment community has tried - unsuccessfully - to do for years : persuade young adults to invest money for retirement . And mutual funds want a big chunk. // Four such companies - IDS , Oppenheimer , Gintel , and Fidelity - have assembled mutual funds exclusively for IRAs and other retirement accounts . They target the fact that IRA investors have long-term retirement income as their goal , plus the tax advantage of an IRA account , which allows for differing portfolio strategies. // // Oppenheimer ' s Regency and Retirement Funds , Fidelity ' s Freedom Fund , Gintel ' s Erisa Fund , and the Managed Retirement Fund from IDS all hope to attract IRA money by gearing up just for those accounts. // Although slow to catch on initially , these funds seem to be gaining . Two of them opened up only in January , accompanied by brisk sales ; and Fidelity reports January sales that set a record , up 80 percent over January 1984. // Whether as a marketing gimmick , investment strategy , or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the tax consequences of their trades . They can take a short-term capital gain without regard to the tax impact on their shareholders. // Short-term capital gains - those on the profit of a stock owned less than six months - are taxed as regular income . Since all returns on an IRA account are taxed equally when the account is cashed out , an IRA-only mutual fund allows its manager to move in and out of stocks at will. // ' ' It ' s nothing but a marketing ploy , ' ' counters the manager of a mutual fund open to all investors . ' ' If you buy a stock for the fund , you ' re doing it because you think that stock is going to rise to a certain price level for certain reasons . When it hits that price , you should sell . . . no matter how long you ' ve owned the stock. // ' ' If you don ' t , you ignore your initial strategy for buying in the first place and risk the stock moving against you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax consequences in something as volatile as the market . We ' re here to make profits , not tax shelters. ' ' // George Vanderheiden , who manages Fidelity ' s Freedom Fund , concedes that the tax advantage is slight , particularly since the short-term gains holding period was shortened from 12 to six months , but insists that it gives him more freedom. // ' ' Some stocks have been in since the fund started . I ' ve bought some other stocks that never saw sunset ; I bought them in the morning and sold them after lunch . I ' d think twice about doing that if I had to worry about short-term capital gains . I run another fund here called Destiny , and the directors get very upset if our capital-gains distribution is heavily short term. // ' ' Last year , for example , over 90 percent of the gains in Destiny were long term . In Freedom over the same period , over 90 percent of gains were short term. ' ' // Gordon Fines , manager of the the IDS Managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lets me make investment decisions as I see fit , but it is not my intent to ' day-trade . ' I am very cynical about a person ' s ability to do that with a portfolio. ' ' // With its two funds , Oppenheimer &; Co. has gone after both ends of the IRA spectrum : conservative investors building a nest egg and young , aggressive investors who feel they have the time and flexibility to raise the risk/reward ante with their IRAs . Both funds are relatively new . The Retirement Fund opened in January and has pulled in $10 million to date . The more aggressive , $130 million Regency Fund opened in 1983. // ' ' As a result of extensive market research , we found that the ( IRA ) investing consumer is interested in diversification - not a lot of decisionmaking , but something that offers flexibility , ' ' says Donald W. Spiro , president of Oppenheimer &; Co . The company ' s response was the Retirement Fund , which accepts money only for IRA , Keogh , and 401(k) retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , government bonds , and a money-market fund - and allows investors to move their money among them anytime and in any proportion . They can also buy life or disability insurance through the fund. // ' ' For conservative investors it strikes me as an opportunity to do something they couldn ' t otherwise do themselves - what the prudent wealthy would do , ' ' comments Reg Green , editor of Mutual Fund News Service . ' ' It is the classic balanced portfolio of safety , income , and growth , the root and branch of investment thinking for wealthy people. ' ' // For the new IDS fund , which started last month and has raised $8 million , Mr. Fines seeks the same flexibility . The fund will move in and out of stocks or bonds to whatever degree the market dictates . ' ' We can be as aggressive or defensive as we need to be , ' ' he says . Right now he is optimistic about the stock market , the economy , and interest rates . The mix is 80 to 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation ( ' ' For truckers and railroads , it doesn ' t matter if you ' re carrying a Ford or a Toyota , ' ' he says ) ; communications media ; and financial service groups. // ' ' The asset mix will be under continual review , ' ' he adds . ' ' What we ' re providing the IRA investor is professional investment management , making the investment decisions about where to put IRA money every year as well as during the year. ' ' // Unfortunately , one of the mutual funds best suited for IRAs has fallen out of their reach . Qualified Dividend Portfolio I Fund , from the Vanguard Group of investment companies , deliberately sought short-term capital gains and dividend income returns to lure corporations , which can exclude part of dividend income from taxes . Just over 70 percent of the fund goes to common stocks , with the largest groupings in utilities , natural gas , telephones , banks , and autos. // Although aimed at companies , the fund attracted considerable IRA money , since the dividend income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors , takes a deferred tax status . On the good-news side , QDPI returned 17 percent for the year ending Oct. 31 , 1984 , and has averaged 21. 7 percent annually over the preceding 10 years . Now the bad news : You can ' t get in . The fund was too popular , says Brian Mattes , assistant vice-president of the Valley Forge , Pa. , mutual fund family , and was on the verge of collecting too much money for the available investment choices. // //
