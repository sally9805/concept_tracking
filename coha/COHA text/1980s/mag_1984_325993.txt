His visit stirs presidential politics and U.S.-Soviet relations <P> The silvery Aeroflot 11-62M rolled up to a remote corner of New York City 's John F. Kennedy Airport last week , its Cyrillic letters designating it an aircraft of the Soviet Union . Out stepped the dour and durable figure of Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko , for 27 years the Soviet Union 's top diplomat , who was arriving in New York to attend the 39th annual opening session of the United Nations General Assembly . Gromyko and his entourage of about 30 began walking toward an eleven-car motorcade lined up on the tarmac . Then , spotting a band of reporters and photographers on hand for his touchdown , Gromyko turned from the group of assistants and security men around him and doffed his hat in an unsmiling , enigmatic greeting . <P> Gromyko 's arrival , though it had the trappings of diplomatic ritual , was anything but routine . A little more than a year ago , in the midst of the worldwide outrage over the Soviet Union 's shooting down of Korean Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey ordered the Port Authority to deny landing rights to Gromyko 's jetliner at any of its airport facilities , including J.F.K. The Foreign Minister was sufficiently incensed by their action to cancel abruptly and angrily his appearance at the U.N . Not even an offer by Washington to allow his craft to put down at a U.S. military airfield could persuade Gromyko to overlook what he clearly regarded as an officially tolerated affront to Soviet dignity . In subsequent months , he demonstrated , by words and attitude , his own displeasure with the U.S. <P> This year , by contrast , Gromyko was arriving not only to deliver a major address at the U.N . outlining the Soviet Union 's view of world affairs , a matter of growing concern to other nations as the result of seemingly immobilized leadership within the Kremlin . He was also scheduled to meet at the White House on Friday with Ronald Reagan , thus becoming the sole high-level Soviet official with whom the President has held discussions zin more than 3 years in office . Out of that session , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-stakes state of relations between the superpowers , which have sunk to their lowest point in two decades . The meeting could also show some signs of diplomatic movement , perhaps even a breakthrough agreement of some sort . Finally , it could set the tone for U.S.-Soviet diplomacy in a second Reagan Administration . <P> Indeed , a remarkable aspect of Gromyko 's trip was his willingness to interject himself into domestic electoral politics : in addition to calling on a President actively seeking reelection , he planned to meet the preceding day with Democratic Challenger Walter F. Mondale . Rarely if ever have lines between the nation 's fiercely partisan politics at home and its foreign policy become so blended , and possibly blurred , just six weeks before a presidential election .
