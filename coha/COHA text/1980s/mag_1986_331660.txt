Not long ago , moneymen started to look upon Latin America 's ominous $370 billion debt load as the crisis that went away . The borrowers were gamely trying to make their payments and shape up their economies . But last week several Latin countries sent out new distress signals . Mexico 's Finance Minister Jesus Silva Herzog , whose country 's financial condition has been devastated by falling oil revenues , rushed to Washington to seek aid in closed-door meetings with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , Secretary of State George Shultz and Treasury Secretary James Baker . Meanwhile , Peru suddenly withdrew its gold , silver and cash reserves from U.S. banks to prevent any effort by Washington to freeze them . When foreign ministers and finance chiefs from five major debtors  --  Brazil ( $104 billion ) , Mexico ( $97 billion ) , Argentina ( $49 billion ) , Venezuela ( $32 billion ) and Peru ( $14 billion )  --  gathered late in the week near the Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta del Este for an emergency meeting , they drafted an urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By far the most desperate borrower is Mexico , which estimates that it may need $9 billion in new loans this year just to meet interest payments on its foreign debts .

Indeed , the ministers who convened at Punta del Este issued a communique demanding " significant changes in existing agreements , in particular with respect to interest rates . " <P> Even though other Latin American nations are in somewhat better shape than Mexico , they contend that over the long haul the debt burden could cripple their economies , stir social unrest and conceivably bring down their shaky governments as well .
