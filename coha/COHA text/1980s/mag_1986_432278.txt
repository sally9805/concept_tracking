 | I can remember them well . . . both of them . In the 1970s , when I was working on " The Right Stuff , " the NASA brass had set themselves two stupendous , herculean tasks . One was highly publicized . It was the development of a space shuttle , a coach-andfreight service that would bring the public into space , a people 's zero-G express . The other was spoken of only sotto voce , entre nous , behind the hand , out the corner of the mouth , after a glance down the corridor before you ducked into so-andso 's office . It was the dismantling of what was known as Astropower ? the political grip the original breed of fighter-pilot test-pilot astronauts had on NASA . This demolition job was not easy , for Astropower was founded upon a very heavy debt . The fighter-test pilots were the breed who had been willing , over and over again , to sit on top of enormous tubular bombs , some 36 stories high , gorged with several of the most explosive materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GS-18 engineer light the fuse . The presence aboard the Challenger of Christa McAuliffe , a woman who taught social studies at a high school in New Hampshire , was meant to symbolize the culmination of both endeavors . She was the first space-coach passenger , not counting a pair of congressional junketeers . Her flight was to be the crossover , at last , from a quarter of a century in which space had been a frontier open only to pioneers who lived and were willing to die by the code of " the right stuff " ? the Alan Shepards , John Glenns and Neil Armstrongs ? to an era when space would belong to the entire citizenry , to Everyman . The last role in the world NASA had in mind for Christa McAuliffe and the rest of the Challenger crew was that of pioneer or hero . The crew seemed to have been chosen to represent Everybody 's America . One was black , one was Jewish , one was Asian-American from a new state , Hawaii , and two were women . And it was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dreaded 25 years ago when another New Hampshirite , Shepard , climbed up on top of the first American man-in-space rocket : a cataclysmic fireball . It was not his sheer force of personality that made Shepard the very epitome of same fate as Challenger . On July 29 , 1960 , NASA brought Shepard , Glenn , their five fellow Mercury astronauts and hundreds of VIP 's to the cape to see a Mercury capsule launched atop an Atlas rocket , the system that was supposed to take astronauts into orbit . July 29 was a dark , rainy day , which only made the liftoff of the rocket all the more spectacular . The Earth rumbled underfoot , and the rocket rose slowly on three columns of flame . It appeared to be a perfect launch . After 60 seconds the rocket was almost directly overhead and gradually nosing over on its long arc toward the horizon , and the astronauts and everybody else were watching the Ahura Mazda surge , when ? ka-boom ! ? it blew up . Just like that , right over their beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments were going to rain down on the astronauts themselves . There was no danger , in fact ; the rocket 's momentum had carried the debris away . It was a sight and a half for Shepard &; Co. , however . Their astonished gullets were stuck up in the air along with the rest of the crowd 's . In the 10 days before Shepard 's flight , two more rockets carrying unmanned Mercury capsules blew up ? or had to be blown up by remote control because they were heading toward St. Petersburg instead of the sky . Neither was the type of rocket that was going to take Shepard for his 15-minute suborbital ride . But it was too late to make fine distinctions . The lesson that had been rammed home to the public was : our rockets all blow up and our boys always botch it . And there you had the backdrop of the launch of Alan Shepard on May 5 , 1961 . All the world wondered what kind of human being it was who had the courage to sit on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignite it . When the countdown began at the cape , it was the morning rush hour in California . The California Highway Patrol noticed a weird and troubling phenomenon . By the hundreds motorists were pulling off the freeways and stopping on the shoulders . The CHP did n't have AM radios , but the motorists did , and to listen to the detonation of Alan Shepard and drive at the same time was more than the central nervous system could stand . Shepard not only survived but had a nearly perfect flight , a rocket lob up into the lower reaches of space and down into the Atlantic near Bermuda . It was Shepard 's display of seemingly superhuman courage , as much as anything else , that rallied the public and Congress behind President Kennedy 's call , just 20 days later , for Americans to land on the moon by 1970 . For a time Shepard was a hero on the order of a Lindbergh . His fellow citizens in Derry , N.H. ? less than 30 miles from Christa McAuliffe 's hometown , Concord ? came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before they got hold of themselves . Well , what kind of creature was this hero ? Like the other astronauts , Shepard was a test pilot from the military , in his case , the Navy . The Navy 's own statistics would show that a pilot , over a 20-year career , stood a 23 percent chance of dying in an accident and a 56 percent chance of having to eject and come down by parachute to keep from it . These figures did not include combat , where such mishaps were not considered accidental . In other words , it was the kind of job in which you faced one chance in four of dying during the routine performance of your duties . The fighter pilot had replaced the cavalryman as the glamorous warrior of the 20th century . Sure enough , the mortality of the astronauts turned out to be typical of the pilot breed generally . As NASA sped through the Mercury , Gemini and Apollo programs in the rush to reach the moon before the Soviets , no astronaut died in the critical moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fire on the ground in a dress rehearsal of Apollo 1 . But four died in routine trips in their T-38s ? supersonic fighters without weaponry ? and one died in an automobile wreck coming home from a party ( also typical of the breed ) . Throughout , it was a spectacle of the heroic astronaut , as much as the pressure of the space race , that made Americans agreeable to the tremendous effort and stupendous expense that culminated in the landing on the moon in July of 1969 . Whatever NASA wanted , the Congress gave ? and whenever they were asked . Once the race was won , however , exhaustion set in . By the early 1970s , after six voyages to the moon , NASA found itself in the position of Columbus after his fourth voyage to America . The U.S. Congress , like Ferdinand and Isabella before them , began to feel that while this pioneering out on the edge of the known world had been good for the soul , it had cost an arm and a leg and had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crew had barely returned from the moon before Congress began calling for more scientific fieldwork , and less derring-do , in the moon missions . The NASA brass were certainly willing , but here they ran into Astropower in earnest . Because of earlier congressional pressure , NASA had selected six scientist-astronauts in 1965 and 11 more in 1967 . As of 1969 , not one had ever gone up . By now the astronauts had developed a pecking order that was military in its rigidity . Astronauts who were former fighter pilots and test pilots and had been on space flights were at the top , with Shepard , Frank Borman and Tom Stafford as perhaps the topmost . ( Glenn , Wally Schirra and others had already left . ) Astronauts who were former fighter pilots but had been selected for their engineering credentials were forever down below deck , even though they had been into space . As for the scientist-astronauts . . . they were n't even considered astronauts . Their wives huddled together at the picnics of the AWC , the Astronauts ' Wives Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Excess Eleven . At one astronaut group meeting with NASA administrator James Webb , one of the XS-11 said : " Mr. Webb , this hiatus in funding you 've been referring to ? how would you say that the scientific community ... " Borman broke in : " To hell with the scientific community . " There was laughter , and Webb said nothing . Such was Astropower . In 1971 Shepard went up as commander of Apollo 14 , and the major scientific experiments included him driving a golf ball ? the longest drive in the history of golf thanks to the moon 's gravity ? and Edgar Mitchell trying ( unofficially , during rest periods ) to send telepathic messages to fellow parapsychologists on Earth . The congressional clamor for more science rose again , but it was only through some eleventh-hour arm-twisting that even congressmen were able to break through Astropower and get a lone scientist-astronaut , Harrison Schmidt , a geologist , on the final moon mission , Apollo 17 , in 1972 . The NASA brass found their budget cut to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston . Now that Practical and Tangible were the order of the day , they would obey . They gave up the cosmic plans formulated in the palmy days of the late 1960s , such as a manned mission to Mars that might have taken place by the early 1980s . They used the pretext of the shifting priorities to break up the Astronaut Office , headed by Shepard , into three offices , the idea being that his power would be diluted . They were more than happy to have Deke Slayton take part in the Apollo-Soyuz mission of 1975 , to get him back into astronaut training and out of his powerful position in the NASA hierarchy . They dusted off a program the Air Force had first had on the boards in 1957 , before Sputnik went up : namely , the X-20 program , featuring a winged aircraft that would also fly in orbit . Improving upon it with latter-day technology , they unveiled the space shuttle . They selected new astronauts , with the emphasis entirely on scientific capability . Most were not pilots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as bus drivers on the zero-G route . The adjectives " pioneering " and " heroic " were thrown down the memory hole . At its Ames research center near San Jose , NASA began running tests of Everyman , including old people and people with common physical disabilities , to find out just how broad a population could take the stresses of launch acceleration and flight . One of the old-line astronauts , John Young , who would command the first shuttle flight , told the press : " If you 're alive and breathing , you can fly on the shuttle . " In a single instant last week 's explosion obliterated this entire decade-old design , at least for now . Christa McAuliffe was far more than the first space passenger . Whether she was aware of it or not , wanted to or not , she hurtled for 73 seconds out on the edge of a stillraw technology . Then she perished . Now NASA will be dogged by a new question . If space flight still involves odds unacceptable to Everyman , then should it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of hanging their hides , quite willingly , out over the yawning red maw ? @#
