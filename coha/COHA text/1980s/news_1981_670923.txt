In the past , when confronted with a defective test item , Educational Testing Service , which designs and administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test and other examinations , has corrected the question on future tests but made no effort to change the test scores of students who might have been misled by the erroneous questions. // Two weeks ago the Graduate Record Examination Board , which recently discovered faulty items on two of its specialized tests , voted not to change any scores unless they made a difference of more than 10 points on a scale of 200 to 900. // " We continually tell colleges that it is dangerous to make judgments about students on the basis of 10-point differences , " said Robert Altman , acting vice president for higher education programs of the testing service , which also administers the Graduate Record Examination . " If we sent out corrections of this magnitude , it would contradict everything we have been telling them. " // Other testing officials , however , argue that the integrity of the testing process requires prompt rescoring of any test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " A certain amount of error is unavoidable in any testing situation , and for each test we publish the ' standard error of measurement , ' " said E. Belvin Williams , senior vice president for testing programs at E.T.S. " If you don ' t correct mistakes when you learn about them , you are adding a new element of known error. " // The issue of defective test items arose last month when a Florida schoolboy convinced Educational Testing Service that his " wrong answer " to a geometry question on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test was in fact the right one . Soon afterward , a student from New York successfully challenged a mathematics item on the Scholastic Aptitude Test . In both cases the tests were rescored , and thousands of students found themselves with slightly higher scores. // Although scores have periodically been " recalled " after being sent to students and colleges because of scoring and other statistical mistakes , the two incidents represented the first time that this has been done because a question had been judged faulty . The major reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s new " truth in testing " law , testers have begun giving students copies of the actual test they took as well as their answer sheet. // In a series of interviews , developers of various admissions tests conceded that even before " truth in testing " they would occasionally discover faulty items after tests were administered , usually because of routine monitoring procedures but sometimes because a student would remember the question and write in . In most cases this occurred before scoring was completed , and the defective item was simply eliminated. // In some cases , however , the error was not discovered until after scores were reported . Various officials at E.T.S. said that , as far as could be determined , this had happened three times over the last decade on the Scholastic Aptitude Test , once since 1967 on the Law School Admission Test and once on the Graduate Management Admission Test. // In most of these instances , officials said , the students who raised the issue were given credit for alternative answers . Since the answers they proposed were not among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other students ' scores were changed. // On the other hand , in two recent cases students successfully challenged questions on the Graduate Record Examination . A question on an advanced engineering test was misworded and , according to Bernard Khoury , director of G.R.E. programs for the testing service , had the effect of " asking a question that we had no intention of asking . " Another defective item was found on an advanced psychology test. // Mr. Khoury said that in both cases the question will be corrected on future tests , but no effort will be made to change any scores . " There are at least 80 possible scores that you can get on these tests , and one item will not change scores by that much , " he said. // Another argument for not reporting small score changes is the cost . Officials estimate that the much-publicized rescoring of the S.A.T. and P.S.A.T. items cost as much as $100 , 000 each , a cost that eventually comes out of the pockets of testtakers. // Others , however , criticize this position . Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , president of the Law School Admission Services , which assembles the data on the law boards , said , " I wouldn ' t want to apply the same logic to our test or to the Scholastic Aptitude Test . There are instances , even if we do not consider them justified , in which 10 points can have an impact on a person ' s educational opportunities . It might not keep someone out of law school , but it might affect which one he could go to. " // Some officials also noted that , while testmakers discourage the practice , some large state universities establish miminum test scores as " cutoffs " to limit applications . Preliminary selection for National Merit Scholarships is also based on cutoffs from the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test. // " The fact is we don ' t always know how the tests are being used , " said Mr. Williams . " As long as there is any chance that not rescoring will affect any individual , then it is irresponsible not to do so. " // Since " truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , officials of Educational Testing Service and the various test sponsors are now considering changes in the testing process that would bring them to light before scoring is completed. // One proposal , for example , is to allow students to check their answers as soon as the test is over and then give them a limited amount of time to complain about any questions they regard as erroneous or unfair . Another proposal - one that would not require having the answers on the premises while students were taking the test - would be to have students take home a carbon of their answers and then mail them the questions and answer key shortly afterwards. // " We ' re studying various ways to handle the problem , " said George Hanford , president of the College Board , which sponsors the Scholastic Aptitude Test . " We have to see what makes sense in the new domain in which we are operating. " // In deciding not to rescore the specialized tests with the two defective items , the Graduate Record Examination Board also declared that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Robert J. Solomon , executive vice president of the testing service , said that this decision was " responsible " but that he personally disagreed with it . " We ' re now operating in a climate of voluntary disclosure , " he said , " and I feel an obligation to make this information public . To do otherwise would be inconsistent. " // Underlying the debate is the fact that " truth in testing " has raised new issues of what constitutes responsible policy in testing and who should decide those policies . In the past , top officials of Educational Testing Service and other organizations were free to make and enforce their own judgments . " It was easier to make a covert decision , " said Thomas Donlan , an E.T.S. official who was formerly in charge of test development , " but they also had a high concept of stewardship for the program. " // In the current climate , however , such decisions can no longer be made privately . " The issue is where responsibility lies , " said Mr. Williams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with before disclosure.
