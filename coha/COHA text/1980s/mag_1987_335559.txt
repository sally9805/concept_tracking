Though only half a mile away Warsaw Pact ships were firing at targets , the crew on the 300-ft . West German navy tender Neckar exhibited no alarm . Nothing ever happened during routine surveillance missions . So , midmorning in the Baltic Sea , the NATO craft sat passively while two 600-ton Soviet-made corvettes of the Polish navy blasted practice shots at unmanned drones . <P> Suddenly a burst of fire hit the water just 16 ft. from the Neckar . Then a corvette struck the German craft with eight 30-mm shells , setting her stern gun turret afire and punching a hole in her hull beneath the waterline . Three crewmen were injured . After the fire was put out and the leak plugged , the Neckar limped into its home port of Kiel . To prevent damage to NATO-Warsaw Pact relations , Bonn described the attack as an accident , perhaps caused by the poor aim of Polish gunners . Warsaw began an investigation into the occurrence .                  @ @ @
