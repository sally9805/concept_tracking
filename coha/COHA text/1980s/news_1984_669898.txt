Holy Jane Fonda ! After years of playing Hollywood ' s favorite whipping boy , Free Enterprise is suddenly becoming respectable on the screen again . And nowhere is the trend more apparent than in the box-office hit of the year , " Ghostbusters . " At first glance  --  indeed , at second and third glance  --  " Ghostbusters " is nothing more than a blithe bit of fluff . Comedians Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play a trio of defrocked academics , specialists in the paranormal , who rid New York of a plague of unfriendly spirits . Along the way , they also rescue Sigourney Weaver , a glamorous co-op dweller whose body and refrigerator are invaded by the evil apparitions . Such antics , and some snappy special effects , have earned " Ghostbusters " more than $190 million in ticket sales since its release this spring . So what can this cheerful nonsense have to do with Free Enterprise ? Apart from the obvious cash nexus between big box office and big profits for the producers , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : The film ' s heroes , bounced from cushy posts on a university faculty , set out to strike it rich . They form a small business , funded with capital that they raise by mortgaging Mr. Aykroyd ' s house . Given the trendy , high-tech nature of their enterprise , they might have turned to a venture-capital fund or R &; partnership for the cash , but remember , these are paranormalists , not MBAs . To draw customers , they use TV commercials and jingles ( " If there ' s somethin ' strange/ In your neighborhood , / Who dya call ? / Ghostbusters ! " ) . Like all good businessmen , they ' re keen negotiators . Their first major customer , a hotelier , balks at their fee , until they threaten to set loose the gremlin they have just scooped up from his ballroom . Most telling of all , the film ' s villain is a bureaucrat , a regulation enforcer from the Environmental Protection Agency . This insidious apparatchik exposes Gotham to mortal danger , and almost puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environmental-impact statement or else close down the electronic grid within which they ' ve imprisoned a host of malevolent spirits . The heroes counterattack with a central tactic of modern business . They lobby the mayor directly . He gets the EPA man pulled off their case , and they ' re free to launch an ultimately successful assault on the demons ' lair . We aren ' t told the size of their fee for this accomplishment , but we can assume it ' s substantial . In short , Ghostbusters Corp. does good by doing well , in the best tradition of the profit motive and Adam Smith ' s invisible hand . Does this mean that business folk can leave their Valium at home when they venture out to the flicks ? Well , not just yet . After all , there are years of film tradition to reckon with . Recently , to mention a few examples , we ' ve had Ms. Fonda and Jack Lemmon jousting with the nuclear-utility establishment in " The China Syndrome , " Sally Field battling the nefarious textile bosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heartless media barons in " Network , " Warren Beatty as the pro quarterback whose soul is placed in the body of a rapacious , polluting conglomerateur in " Heaven Can Wait , " and John Huston in " Chinatown " portraying the embodiment of evil as a Southern California land-and-water magnate . Hollywood has always found it good business to attack business , of course . But in recent years , a certain Darwinism of villainy has knocked off most of the other stock baddies . If the Germans and Japanese were our allies , if we were pursuing detente with the Russians and Chinese , and if the Indians surrounding the wagon train must now be viewed as noble defenders of their land against the covetous White Eyes , then who was left ? Brooks Brothers pin stripes became the vestments of mischief , and " corporate " became a four-letter word . Business bashing moved alongside seduction and decapitation as sure-fire ticket sellers . In the 1980s , this relentlessly dark vision began to brighten here and there . Some of the sweet , entrepreneurial incense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century City , for the movies began uttering occasional good words for the qualities that business holds dear : boldness , vision , greed . Before " Ghostbusters , " to be sure , the good words were tentative and equivocal . In " Night Shift " and " Risky Business , " the comic heroes made their mark in a cottage industry , which , alas , happened to be prostitution . In " Kidco , " shown in a few cities early this year , a group of teen-agers succeeded in business , but they were marketing manure for fertilizer . Audiences sniffed their disapproval , and the movie was yanked from general release . But the pro-business boomlet was on its way . Business people , as well as business virtues , began to get an occasional kindly glance from the scriptwriters . In " Flashdance , " the male lead ran a steel mill . And in " Splash , " the protagonist ran a food business . True , he stayed away from the office in order to chase after a shapely mermaid , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeclared image-rehabilitation campaign likely to go ? If you ' re a banker , you ' re probably out of luck . Even other business people hate their bankers . Just the other day , " Places in the Heart " opened with Sally Field as a plucky Depression widow struggling to protect kiddies and homestead from the foreclosing grasp of guess who . Your only consolation is that in " Country , " this season ' s other **32;243;TOOLONG flick , Jessica Lange ' s mortgage-holding bete noire is not a bank but a government agency , the Farmers Home Administration . Finally , if you ' re in Big Business , you ' ll have to be patient . So far , the cinema encomiums have gone to little guys and little start-up firms . Behemoths of the Fortune 500 remain suspect . But you can hope . Just as the start-ups can grow to be giants , just as tiny Rolm can one day command a $1. 2 billion price from IBM , the fickle flame of Hollywood ' s approbation may someday cast a wider , warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghostbusters "  --  say , " Ghostbusters Go Public " or " Ghostbusting CEO "  --  you ' ll know it ' s safe to take the limo to the movies.  --  - Mr. Steiger is an assistant managing editor of the Journal.
