The official , Aleksandr N. Yakovlev , a member of the Politburo and architect of many of Mr. Gorbachev ' s key foreign and domestic policies , said in an interview Wednesday that grass-roots political movements that recently developed in the three Baltic republics had legitimate grievances , and should , in general , be encouraged. // " We believe a new status should be elaborated for the constituent republics , and we ' re working on this , " he said . <> <> ' Out of Touch With Reality ' // But Mr. Yakovlev said that many of the movements ' ideas were " out of touch with reality " and that any expectation that the republics could regain the independent status they had before Soviet annexation in 1940 is " simply unrealistic . " Excerpts , page A10 . Mr. Yakovlev also described his childhood and his disillusionment with Stalin , and spoke of how some of his stern views of the United States were formed by incidents that took place when he was a student in the United States in 1959. // For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York two salesmen asked him to take off his hat so they could look at his forehead . He quoted them as saying , " We heard you all had horns , " recounting this as a request made " in all seriousness " by " plain , half-educated people , " one of " hundreds " of such encounters he had in America . Page A10 . Mr. Yakovlev , who was named last month in a leadership shake-up to head a new Communist Party Central Committee commission on international relations , also made these points in a two-and-a-half hour conversation in his large , sunlit office at Central Committee headquarters near the Kremlin : // * The election of Vice President Bush or Gov . Michael S. Dukakis as President will not make much difference in Soviet-American relations , because underlying trends are favorable. // * Moscow sees no reason to dismantle a disputed radar in Siberia that is an arms control issue just because Washington has rejected a Soviet plan to place the station under international control. // * Political change in Eastern Europe poses a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , which , he said , happened in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and is happening in Poland today. // * A return to Stalinism is unthinkable in the Soviet Union , even if the changes introduced by Mr. Gorbachev fail. // * The party leadership , faced with a worse economic situation and less enthusiasm for change among Russians than it expected when Mr. Gorbachev assumed office three years ago , has made mistakes , and will probably make more , but is flexible and determined to push ahead with change. // * There is no senior deputy to Mr. Gorbachev in the Communist Party hierarchy , and Yegor K. Ligachev - a Politburo member who told Le Monde last year that he was chairman of meetings of the Secretariat , composed of the party ' s top administrative officials - no longer does. // * Under a recently adopted reorganization plan , the commission Mr. Yakovlev heads will be responsible for developing foreign policy options for consideration by the Politburo while the Foreign Ministry will handle the day-to-day execution of policy . <> <> Confident on the Issues // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , combative at other moments , and sometimes defensive in his attitude toward the United States , Mr. Yakovlev moved surely and confidently from issue to issue , jabbing the air or waving his tinted glasses , for emphasis. // An exchange student in New York 30 years ago , and the Politburo member most familar with the United States , Mr. Yakovlev took questions in English , without translation , and answered in Russian. // Mr. Yakovlev , in his comments on Baltic political activity , outlined limits unlikely to satisfy tens of thousands of ethnic Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians who have joined grassroots movements in their republics. // The Kremlin ' s attitude toward the movements has been unclear , and Mr. Yakovlev ' s remarks represented the first , direct Politburo response to demands that have been made in the republics . <> <> A Degree of Autonomy // The founding congress of the Lithuanian movement , held in the republic ' s capital of Vilnius last weekend , called , among other things , for the right to print a separate Lithuanian currency , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic of other Soviet citizens , including Russians. // " How can they have their own currency ? " Mr. Yakovlev said. // " California doesn ' t have its own currency. " // While he said that Moscow would like to encourage a degree of autonomy , and " uproot the arrogant attitude that ' if I didn ' t invent it , it ' s wrong , ' " he said the republics would probably find that many of their ideas were unworkable and driven by emotion. // " I personally believe in the value of common sense , " he said. // Asked if the election of Mr. Bush or Mr. Dukakis as President would make any difference in Soviet-American relations , Mr. Yakovlev replied , " And who is going to be President ? " // " To speak seriously , " he went on , " no matter who is President , the process must , in principle , go on in the same direction. " // " The point here lies deeper than a personality . The point is that , in my view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has often been sharply critical of the United States in his writings , said it was an illusion to think that Moscow would make concessions to the United States on arms control and other issues because of American pressure. // " Americans won ' t agree to special concessions as a sign of good will , nor will the Soviet Union , " he said . <> <> Complaints to Leaders // He added that some Soviet citizens , apparently persuaded that their leaders were giving away too much , were complaining to the leadership. // Mr. Yakovlev said that Moscow did not plan to amend its position on the Siberian radar station that Washington has said must be dismantled before there can be agreement on a treaty to reduce long-range missiles , now being negotiated in Geneva. // The Soviets have offered to place the radar complex under international control for use in space research , a proposal that the White House rejected as inadequate. // Moscow announced today that it was transferring control of the radar from the military to the Soviet National Academy of Sciences and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abalakovo near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. // The Government also said it was prepared to destroy elements of another radar that were transferred from Saryshagan , a central Asian military base , to Moscow and Gomel , a city southwest of the capital . Washington had expressed concern about continued use of the equipment . B.J. Cooper , a White House spokesman , responded today to the Soviet offer , telling Reuters that the radar complex at Krasnoyarsk " is a significant violation of a central element of the ABM treaty . " Speaking during President Reagan ' s visit to Springfield , Mo . , Mr. Cooper said : " It must be corrected in a verifiable manner that meets U.S. criteria . What the Soviets do with the site once they have corrected the violation in an acceptable manner is their business . " While the Administration considers the Krasnoyarsk matter a serious violation of the treaty , the radar transferred from Saryshagan is considered a small , technical violation . Moscow added that it hoped Washington would take reciprocal steps on American radar stations in Greenland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
