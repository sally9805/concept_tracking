" I never thought I 'd say this to anybody , but I got ta go get the atomic bomb out of your car . " <P> What makes this line even funnier than it sounds is that the speaker is 17- year-old Paul Stephens ( Christopher Collet ) ; that his coconspirator , Jenny , is played by a picture of innocence named Cynthia Nixon ; that the exchange takes place at a high school science fair , where the competing projects involve things like soap bubbles and gerbils  --  and that they really do have an A-bomb in her auto . <P> The story of how this unlikely pair happens to be knocking at the door of the nuclear club , and what happens when the U.S. Government learns that two teenagers are making all that racket out there , has a gently realistic comic side . But it is also one of the most intelligent and gripping thrillers of recent years , a picture that transcends its WarGames genre ( mainly because it avoids overt preaching and embraces humor ) to set its own terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Paul 's bomb begins ticking suspensefully not for any vast didactic reasons , but because everyone associated with it behaves in recognizably human fashion . Paul , for example , started to tinker with fissionable material down in the basement because a physicist named John Mathewson ( played by John Lithgow in his best slow-burn style ) is intent on tinkering with Paul 's newly separated mom ( Jill Eikenberry ) . This does not send the boy into an Oedipal frenzy , but it makes him wary when John invites him to his lab to play with a laser . The physicist has underestimated Paul , who is cannily played not as a weirdo science nerd but as a youth who likes to keep his brainpower to himself out of normal adolescent secretiveness . <P> The boy sure knows a pile of plutonium when he sees one , though , and he knows that one this size has no place in the medical research John is pretending to conduct . Obviously , that is just a cover story for experiments with weaponry . And so Paul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner that wittily combines a sophisticated analysis of the lab 's security system with kid-stuff inventiveness ( their tools include a toy truck , Frisbees and a bottle of shampoo ) . <P> , Their motive is merely to alert the neighborhood that dangerous doings are taking place nearby without due process of environmental law . In hot pursuit of the security leak , the Feds apply a very broad mop to the drips , insisting that the idealists are terrorists , thus gaining an informal license to kill . Yet even here Brickman can not resist his best impulses ; he makes his villain ( the subtle John Mahoney ) more a man befuddled under pressure than evil incarnate . And he permits Mathewson to evolve from absentminded professor into a hero who is morally all present and accounted for . <P> Along the way , Brickman makes good points about nuclear proliferation and Government security without interrupting the action . Nor does Brickman , a onetime collaborator of Woody Allen 's , lose his sense of humor , which delivers in glancing blows rather than kidney punches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brickman has invested it with believability and an irresistible emotional pull .
