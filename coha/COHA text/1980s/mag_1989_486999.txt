you might recall Michael Moore as the fellow from Flint , Michigan , who lasted about four months as editor of Mother Jones . After getting canned , he returned with empty pockets to his hometown and sued the magazine for wrongful discharge . This brought him an out-ofcourt settlement of $58,000 ? a turn of events so inspirational that he decided , without the encumbrance of experience , to put his money into making a film . The result , titled Roger and Me , is so good that I wish Mother Jones had fired Moore twice , so he could have made two movies . Though its subject  --  the destruction of a once-prosperous town by factory closings  --  could hardly be more wrenching , Roger and Me is one of the funniest , most invigorating movies you 're likely to see this year . " I figured , who wants to sit in a dark theater and watch people collect free Federal surplus cheese ? " Moore says . " How 's that going to be entertaining ? How 's that going to change anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible and funny ? The Atomic Caf ? is the model he cites  --  and to some degree , Moore has followed that example . Roger and Me is crammed with found footage : home movies , promotional films , TV shows and stock clips , most of them used with deadpan humor . ( This might be the place to mention the editors , Wendey Stanzler and Jennifer Beman ; amazingly , they too are novice filmmakers . ) But the mocking use of found footage is already a bit too familiar a technique ; though well employed here , it would not have been effective in itself . The real delight of Roger and Me comes from Michael Moore 's personality  --  his dry , common-sense wit as a narrator , his shambling on-camera presence , his interest in the people he encounters as he knocks around Flint . In his amused sympathy with all sorts of human oddity he reminds me of such gonzo documentarians as Les Blank and Tony Buba . Moore also brings to mind Harvey Pekar , the auteur of American Splendor comics , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the title , Moore represents not only himself but a long line of industrial laborers . His father used to work on the line at AC Spark-plugs ; his uncle was among the sit-down strikers who founded the United Automobile Workers . On behalf of them and everybody else he knew in Flint , Moore thought he should invite Roger to visit his hometown  --  that being Roger Smith , chair of General Motors . Under Smith 's leadership , G.M. has been closing its U.S. factories and relocating the assembly lines to more favorable climates , such as Mexico . Moore therefore thought it would be a good thing for the G.M. chair to pass through town , so he could see for himself how the loss of 30,000 jobs might cause some inconvenience . Strangely enough , Smith declined the invitation . In fact , he would n't even talk with Moore . A large part of Roger and Me thus consists of a hilarious series of failed efforts to meet Roger Smith .

Usually , he is dressed in an old blue windbreaker and a baseball cap bearing the message " I 'm out for Trout . " He sometimes augments this costume with the accessory of a toothpick stuck between his lips . People keep asking him if he has an appointment . When one of Roger Smith 's guardians requests his credentials , Moore hands over a discount card from a pizza establishment . " I did n't have a business card , " he explains on the sound track . Since these near-encounters with Roger happened at long intervals , Moore had a lot of time on his hands . He filled it by taking his crew around Flint to see how the neighbors were coping with the economic equivalent of occupying ground zero under the Enola Gay . In their own grim way , these meetings are as funny as the hunt for Roger Smith . G.M. had put some money into a job-retraining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Taco Bell . All of them dropped out , though : A Taco Bell manager explains that they could n't take the challenge of the fast-food environment . Other former auto workers and their families started selling Amway products door to door , though this , too , proved full of unexpected risks . One of Moore 's informants , trained as a color consultant for makeup and clothing , suffered a shocking loss of faith when she discovered that the instructors had classified her incorrectly  --  they had called her an autumn , but she was really a spring . Some of the others captured by Moore get a little closer to the bone . At the Flint Plasma Company , Moore talks with a man who makes a living selling blood . " They 're open Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , " the man says , going over it carefully in his mind . " They 're closed Saturday and Sunday . " It 's side-splitting , unless you think about why the man can no longer remember how to say " weekdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore encounters when he sees a sign by the road : " Rabbits and Bunnies ?

It turns out that she makes $10 or $15 a week at this business , her only supplement to Social Security , and no doubteats a hell of a lot of fried bunny . Of the working-class people in Moore 's film , she is one of the survivors , a rare example of someone who actually gets by as an entrepreneur , the route to self-sufficiency touted by the ruling-class people and their shills . The latter provide Roger and Me with its most outrageously funny moments , turning some sections of the film into a fantasia of misguided optimism and all-American puffery .

G.M. built a $1 million exhibit for Auto-World in which a puppet auto worker sang a love song to the robot that was replacing him on the assembly line . The song was titled " Me and My Buddy . " AutoWorld , the marketplace and the hotel are all closed now . I assume the rats are doing fine .

Put on your windbreaker and your baseball cap and get ready for a night on the town . M eanwhile , do n't wait to see another documentary that played in the New York Film Festival , Charlotte Zwerin 's wonderful Thelonious Monk : Straight No Chaser . Ordinarily , movies about great black musicians do n't get much distribution . But in this case , the executive producer happens to be Clint Eastwood , who last year gave us Bird . I assume it did n't take more than one phone call for the folks at Warner Brothers to understand that Mr. Monk had been a very fine artist , and that the publicshould not be deprived of any opportunity to appreciate him . Thank you , Clint Eastwood . And thanks to Charlotte Zwerin , who has put together the most satisfying jazz documentary I 've seen . The core footage was shot by Michael and Christian Blackwood in 1967-68 ; intended for West German television and shown only once , the footage became , in the words of co-producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is n't hard to see why . Monk was often in good form during this period , and the Blackwoods had the sense to shoot his performances in fairly long takes . Their camera , recording in gleaming black and white , looks over Monk 's shoulder , peers up at his face , drops down to note the rhythmic flopping of his right foot , but generally does not go astray . You mostly get to see the real drama of Thelonious Monk : his splayed fingers jabbing at the keys . Zwerin , having been given this gift , knew how to use it . Like the Black-woods , she does n't introduce a lot of extraneous cuts but lets Monk 's performances speak for themselves . That 's all the more necessary because his verbal contributions tend to be gnomic , when not inaudible . To augment the original material , Zwerin has included archival footage and some freshly shot film consisting mostly of interviews and a couple of beautiful duet performances on piano by Tommy Flanagan ana Barry Harris . The biographical narration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  s , both literary and visual . You see the usual pans and zooms on old photographs , but these are kept to a minimum . The biography , of course , is that of a troubled man , and the film addresses those troubles with a welcome frankness . Thelonious Monk Jr. , speaking with the kind of strength and sanity you have to achieve the hard way , recalls that as a child he would sometimes look into his father 's eyes and see that Monk did n't quite recognize him . He admits his impulse then was to run , but his mother , Nellie , would not let him : " My mother clearly let me know that it was our responsibility to look out for this guy , the way he looked out for us , every minute he was able to . " As Monk 's family faced him squarely , so does the film . It shows him in his whirling-dervish dances ; it records the confusion he caused by going on tour without troubling to rehearse his new band , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notorious incident of the loss of his cabaret card on a bum drug rap . The sections of the film on his relationship with Nica de Koenigswarter ? the Baroness ? are given the same matter-of-fact treatment . Far from being sensationalized ( as is too often the case ) , these scenes are among the most touching in the film . Monk felt some peace with the Baroness ; the shots from her house overlooking the Hudson , where Monk composed " Pannonica " for her , are full of the sweet , still moodiness of that ballad . Perhaps the one thing missing is some commentary by Monk 's peers ; of the musicians who played with him , only Charlie Rouse talks about Monk . But then , as a substitute , you have the Flanagan-Harris duos , especially a soft , rather slow version of " Misterioso , " which they play almost like a lullaby . That performance comes just before the final section of the film , on the silence of Monk 's last years and on his funeral . It 's probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects . A Dry White Season , Euzhan Palcy 's adaptation of the novel by Andre Brink , has opened to lukewarm response , which I think is a pity . People seem to feel it should have been more exciting and less predictable . Maybe so ; but the qualities that have disappointed some viewers might appear to others as virtues . Before the picture fades from the screen , I 'd like to ask you to give it a chance . Near the beginning , a schoolteacher named Ben ( Donald Sutherland ) declares , " There 's nothing to be done " ; and a good many characters throughout the film echo his words , for reasons as various as satisfaction , resignation and despair . The time is 1976 ; the place , South Africa . A student uprising is in progress , despite the conviction of most adults that really , nothing can be done . Even Gordon ( Winston Ntshona ) , who is regarded in Soweto as a wise man , seems to feel that way . With a foresight that is all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any demonstration ( to no avail ) . Empty-handed children are about to confront the power of the state , and Gordon has no illusions about how the state will respond . But once the shooting is over , Gordon decides that he , too , must now do something , if only to discover where his son is buried . His family minister counsels him merely to accept the death . So does Ben . ( Gordon , who works as a gardener at the school , appeals to Ben for help , only tohear the standard response . ) Yet Gordon persists ; and so he dies , too . Then it 's Ben 's turn to start believing that something might be done . Stanley ( Zakes Mokae ) , a shantytown activist who was Gordon 's friend , warns Ben not to get involved : " You 're out of it , " he tells the white man with the calm life and pretty family , " so stay out of it . " But the contagion has spread from Gordon 's son to Gordon to Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to do something . At this point , early in the film , Ben still apprehends his desire as a hope . It is in the course of educating him  --  burning away his hope and leaving him with a clearheaded determination in its stead  --  that A Dry White Season turns into something rare and unfashionable . That , I think , may be part of the reason audiences have responded so indifferently to the film , for it is a tragedy . I do n't mean tragedy as it is often understood , in terms of personal morality  --  when he starts out Ben is no hero , nor is it hubris that brings him low . Rather , this is tragedy in its full political dimension : The protagonist pursues his doom for the best of motives , challenging an authority that is deadly in both its force and its laws . The formula for this genre is , " Do the right thing , then die " ? not a welcome lesson for most American audiences , but convincing enough , because of both the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Euzhan Palcy first made her name with Sugar Cane Alley , a film whose charm was so great as almost to obscure its anger . Set in colonial Martinique , the picture told the story of a boy 's education as he worked his way up from the cane fields . Few films have conveyed so vividly the thrill of intellectual awakening ; the protagonist seems almost like Adam , gaining possession of the world with each new thing he names . But the point of Sugar Cane Alley is that knowledge does not come cheap for the black boy . It is bought with the life of his grandmother , who works herself to death so that he can go to school . The protagonist of A Dry White Season gradually understands that he must make a similar bargain : his life for a headline , which will embarrass the South African government for a day or two . Forgive me for giving away the plot ; in this case , I do n't think it much matters . A sense of inevitability ( predictability , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in seeing how Ben might haggle over terms , as he might in less stringent genres . Rather , you watch A Dry White Season for the sake of participating emotionally with Ben as he slowly realizes that his bargain , which on the surface looks like a losing proposition , is not merely inevitable but good . Donald Sutherland , who has been none too choosy about his roles over the years , takes on the part of Ben with almost visible relief . He seems to sink into the character , as if it felt as well worn to him as his schoolteacher costume . Everything about the man is relaxed , decent , tweedy ; while under the clothes , Ben still has the lanky , hard body of a onetime rugby hero . Sutherland gets across the impression that Ben is still less a scholar than an athlete , who is greatly shocked to learn that the rules of the game are different from what he 'd been told . In the early scenes , though he defends the regime with the worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he first ventures into Soweto , to view Gordon 's body , he is fully open to the shock of the death and a sense of danger at being the only white in the crowd ; but Sutherland also finds a way to hint that Ben feels rather like a boy on an adventure . Later , when Ben turns inward as if trying to uproot the regime from his own heart , Sutherland seems to grow deeper before your eyes . This is the moral action of the film , which is not exactly exciting but still can be engrossing in its own way . In a single , brief reaction shot , Sutherland can take you through an entire cycle of shock , reflection and pained understanding . Zakes Mokae , who can look strong even while pretending to cringe before a police sergeant , is perhaps more an icon than a character when compared with Ben . For him , every question is already settled ; the only decision is how many levels of irony to put into his rasp of a voice  --  which is , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mokae 's one departure from iconic status is a drunk scene , of which the less said the better . His performance is admirable , as always , but I wish he 'd been allowed the same range as Sutherland . The other notable performance belongs to Marlon Brando , as a civil rights lawyer who sues the government over Gordon 's death just to demonstrate to Ben that nothing , really nothing , can be done . Political commitment seems to have moved Bran-do to act instead of just making an appearance . His body now resembles that of Orson Welles ( perhaps as he appeared in Compulsion , as Clarence Darrow ) ; he adopts the eyeglasses and hair of William Kunstler . Sly , witty , long used to futility , this character gives Brando the opportunity for a star turn , which he expertly tones down into a memorably lively character part . Palcy 's direction , apart from her calibration of these performances , tends to be understated . She keeps the camera moving fluidly within scenes ; when she wants to editorialize , she uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the manicured lawns of the school ) , a technique so common as to be in its way unobtrusive . The biggest , most flamboyant sequences come near the beginning , with Palcy 's re-creation of the massacre of the Soweto students . She proves she can be pretty effective with this sort of material ; but then she settles down to a story that has more to do with moral wrestlings than with the action in the street . I think she introduces one very false note at the end ? an event that gives the audience its chance to cheer , and thereby diminishes the tragedy and some of her dramaturgy seems less than fresh . But that wo n't take away my pleasure in recalling Donald Sutherland late in the film , as he recognizes and accepts one final betrayal , then goes ahead with a plan he knows to be fatal . This might not be stirring filmmaking , and it is certainly not original ; but I think Paley and Brink and Sutherland truly mean what they 're doing . The depth of feeling comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Film Festival going into immediate distribution , I can recommend two in particular . Yaaba , by Idrissa Ouedraogo , is a fable shot in and around a village in Burkina Faso , using a cast of nonprofessionals . The plot concerns the friendship between a young boy and an old woman who is suspected of being a witch and has to live as an outcast . I ca n't say the movie transcends one 's expectations for this sort of production ; you generally hope to see unusual , expressive faces and an unfamiliar landscape , and if there 's good music ( as is usually the case with African films ) , then so much the better . The standard way of complimenting films such as Yaaba is to call them charming ; if that sounds like faint praise , I apologize . Charm is what the picture has , in ample measure , and for that Ouedraogo and his cast should be congratulated . Breaking In , directed by Bill Forsyth from a screenplay by John Sayles , is a rather anecdotal film about an old safecracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime , a goofy young man named Mike ( Casey Siemaszko ) . Forsyth 's films , like the better Third World village pictures you see at festivals , live or die on their charm . This one has as much unhurried geniality as Yaaba . For most of the picture , the criminal buddies do n't have to run from the cops ; in fact , they do n't encounter anything much worse than a curious guard dog . The creation of such a placid atmosphere should not be taken for granted , though . Breaking In gives you a wealth of information , as John Sayles usually does in his scripts , but it moves rather more gracefully than anything Sayles has directed himself . You ca n't expect belly laughs from the picture , but you will probably smile broadly throughout . ?
