CARSON , Calif. - Summer league basketball conjures up images of outdoor courts , star players showing up late in the first quarter or leaving early in the fourth , scores such as 170-158 and assists resulting from anything other than behind-the-back passes occurring about as often as female appointments to the Supreme Court . But summer league basketball in the California State University- DominguezHills gymnasium means teams under the sponsorship of NBA clubs practicing two hours on the morning of a game , refereeing prospects under NBA auspices reviewing videotapes of their performances with the likes of Darrell Garretson and Jake O ' Donnell , teams coached by NBA assistants passing the ball 10 times without a shot on some occasions and conservative scores suchas 111-106 being commonplace . In other words , it ' s all business . What we have here is the Southern California Summer Pro Basketball League , an offseason program which demonstrates , if you think about it , that in the NBA there no longer is an offseason . Twelve NBA clubs sponsor complete teams in the 20-team circuit , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four teams are all comprised of free agents who emerged from tryouts conducted back in June . Play began on June 30 and will continue through July 25 , the night of the championship final . There is either a tripleheader or quadrupleheader conducted every day , Saturdays and Sundays included , in the Cal State-Dominguez Hills gym , which is located about 20-25 Harbor Freeway minutes south of Los Angeles proper . The Big Names aren ' t here . Perhaps the closest thing to a star - unless you count Marvin Barnes - is New Jersey ' s Mike O ' Koren . That ' s if you don ' t count Seattle ' s Lonnie Shelton , who is recuperating from a wrist operation and needs to shed the 45 ( honest ) extra pounds he put on during his inactive period . Let ' s just say that if Joan Rivers is correct when she observes that Liz Taylor is so fat , her thighs are going condo , then Shelton is so fat , his thighs are filing for statehood . This is a league for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donaldson , Brad Holland , Alonzo Bradley , Jackie Dorsey , Larry Demic , etc. ) , rookies ( there are five 1981 first- round draft choices on display ) and the multitude of free agents , some young and some who have lost a lot of tread on their tires , who are pursuing The Dream . One of the road-weary hopefuls was stylin ' Freddie Saunders , a former Celtic , Sun and Jazz performer who has been out of basketball for three years . Now working as an oil field maintenance production assistant in Lafayette , La. , the 30-year-old Saunders came here on his vacation in order to give basketball one last shot . " I didn ' t feel I was cut ( by New Orleans ) on the basis of my ability , " he claims . " I just didn ' t fit into their plans . " Despite the notable lack of interest displayed in him by the NBA during the ensuing years , Saunders still believes he can play NBA ball . Saunders was starting for Molten , one of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d have to make a big impression in a hurry , since his vacation was to end last Thursday and he ' d have to head back to Louisiana . He said that if no NBA team called , he ' d be through with basketball forever . " No local leagues or anything like that for me , " Saunders declared . " I was privileged to extend my abilities to the highest , and the only place I could do that was the NBA . There ' s something in my subconscious that won ' t let me play the same way against any other competition . That ' s why I won ' t mess with it anymore . I won ' t play as hard , and that ' s when you get hurt . So I ' ll justput a stop to it and try to direct my energy another way . " Hopes have risen among the fringe players due to the NBA roster increase next season from 11 to 12 players , and from the knowledge that almost every NBA team will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hopes of uncovering a gem . The assessment of basketball talent is a highly inexact science . Witness Detroit ' s monumental misjudgment of guard Darwin Cook last season . Cast adrift by the Pistons , Cook becme a 12-points- per-game scorer for New Jersey and is demonstrating out here on the entertaining Nets ' club that he could become a star NBA guard . Some NBA scout or coach may fall in love with one of these peripheral people and bring him to camp . And when the dust clears on Oct. 30 , he may be getting that $32-a-day meal money . At any rate , this has become the place to be seen . But even more than a showcase for raw talent , this league has become an extension of training camp for many NBA teams . " The league is of great value , " says Phoenix coach John MacLeod , " because of the chance for the young players to gain more experience . There is less of an initiation at the start of training camp because they will already have played 12 games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an asset , another way to evaluate , to teach and to get across what we ' re trying to do . " Laker assistant coach Pat Riley , in charge of a team that includes former Oliver Ames ( North Easton , Mass . ) High and North Carolina State performer Craig Watts , echoes MacLeod ' s sentiments , calling the league a " laboratory . " He feels that the league , which began informally years ago on outdoor courts , has attained real stature . With so many teams practicing rigorously under the supervision of NBA assistants , it should come as no surprise to learn that the games are played for keeps , that winning is a very real issue . The assistants , after all , want to demonstrate that they too can really coach . And this , of course , is where the officials come in . For the first week of play , the referees were all young prospects here under NBA auspices . Among the officiating hopefuls , incidentally , was Somerville ' s Paul Campbell , an excellent candidate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping on the door of the NBA without once receiving a break . Their performances have been monitored by the aforementioned esteemed duo of Garretson and O ' Donnell , as well as rising officiating star Hue Hollins . After each game , they get a critique via videotape and general observation . This weekend , actual NBA officials have arrived to begin working the games . These referees are the lower echelon , mostly quite young officials who , frankly , can use the additional work . But even these are far preferable to having local people work the games . The NBA office recognizes the league as an excellent opportunity to help train officials , and if it weren ' t for The Rule , there would be hardly any problems between coaches and officials here . The Rule is the new zone prohibition , the interpretation of which appears to differ markedly from official to official . The Nets were assessed eight defensive three-second violations in one game , and in their next game , coach Bill Blair got himself tossed out in the first quarter when another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That ejection sent new Nets ' head coach Larry Brown running over to Garretson , who was seated behind the basket . Thus , the fans were treated to the curious sight of a coach who wasn ' t coaching arguing a call with a referee who wasn ' t refereeing , while the game was proceeding nicely in front of them . The Cleveland Cavaliers , naturally , have raised eyebrows , first by suiting up 15 players and secondly by numbering among their athletes a 7-foot-8 player named George Bell who is so inept that the poor guy a ) seems to have real difficulty dunking and b ) can only get into a game if the Cavs are up by 20 , and then only if there are two minutes or less left . On the subject of the ridiculously large complement of players for a summer league team , one rival team official huffed , " The next thing they do right will be the first . " Wise NBA heads realize that caution must be exercised when making evaluations based on the summer league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' player personnel director Al Menendez . " I don ' t get excited about it the way I used to . But it does help us decide who to keep , and I like to see us win because it ' s good for confidence , and you can ' t develop without confidence . " The league is also good because it gives a rookie such as Portland ' s Jeff Lamp the opportunity to begin making a guard-to- forward position switch , or a rookie such as New Jersey ' s Ray Tolbert a chance to expand his playing stylefrom the rigid go-to- your-spot format of Bobby Knight to a pro offense . And all of this is done under proper pro conditions with officials who call a different game than the one they were used to in college . There isn ' t any question that the summer league is here to stay . It ' s not playoff basketball . The players still save more of their hustling for rebounding and fast-breaking than for defense . But it ' s basketball , pro basketball , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children under 12 , it ' s tremendously cheap entertainment for the fans of Southern California . It ' s no longer a case of " offseason " basketball . Just call it " other-season " basketball .
