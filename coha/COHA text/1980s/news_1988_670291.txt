TOKYO  --  Japanese companies are studying the European Community as it negotiates its way toward economic integration in 1992 , wary lest their inherent conservatism cause a misstep in the world ' s largest consumer market . Some Japanese government officials and industry analysts worry that manufacturers aren ' t moving fast enough and may find themselves trailing well entrenched U.S. competitors four years from now . " We wish people had started a little earlier , " says an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , or MITI . " Japanese are good at spotting business chances , but Americans are better at general planning on globalization . They have more experience . Generally speaking they ' re well ahead . " That isn ' t to say Japanese companies haven ' t made inroads in Europe  --  or that the EC isn ' t nervous about Japan ' s growing presence . The strong yen , the desire to circumvent import barriers , and a belief they need to lessen their imbalanced reliance on the U.S. market have driven Japanese companies to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC jumped to $6. 38 billion at the end of 1987 , nearly double the $3. 32 billion at the end of 1986 . More than 400 major Japanese companies now have operations there , many of them in Britain . Still , Japanese fear that 1992 will bring a surge of protectionism in Europe , and that when the trade barriers among the 12 EC nations are abolished they could well be replaced with new restrictions against non-Europeans . MITI is encouraging companies to open " antenna offices " in Brussels , where the EC has its headquarters , to follow developments more closely . Many Japanese companies waited until this year to begin thinking out 1992 strategies . In such industries as retailing , transportation or food , Japanese newcomers worry that they don ' t know enough about the region to act quickly . Regulations differ among European countries and the European market is more culturally diverse than the U.S. and therefore harder to understand , Japanese companies say . " It puzzles Japanese companies and may deter them from being confident in making a quick decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit Bank of Japan . Many companies would rather wait until the specifics of economic integration are settled to decide what to do . They point to examples such as Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , which is trying to plan ahead but is making little headway . Fuji applied in July to open a factory for Subaru cars in France , one of the nations most concerned about Japanese auto imports . The company reasoned that because it isn ' t clear what the EC will consider " European " in 1992 , it would be best to locate in one of the toughest nations to crack . Fuji ' s application is still pending . " Japanese companies tend to be comfortable only if they can see the outcome of integration , " says Yuichi Kuze , a partner in charge of a new 1992 desk at KPMG Peat Marwick Consulting in Tokyo . " They see 1992 as a starting point . " The EC has repeatedly said it won ' t accept plants that are set up just to assemble products out of Japanese components . Japanese companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EC ' s Tokyo office , " is based on their reluctance to grasp the fact that Americans grasped years ago . Being inside one European country is one thing , but if they want to be a European product , they must have high local content . " Meanwhile , Japan ' s industrial presence in Europe remains a small fraction of America ' s . Worried Japanese officials see U.S. multinationals already reviewing their operations or speeding up reorganization in preparation for 1992 . By contrast , even among the Japanese companies that are most advanced in Europe , such studies are just beginning . " We probably should have a group specifically forming contingency plans for 1992 , but we don ' t , " says a Nissan Motor Co. spokesman . Instead , companies are feverishly learning the basics . The EC library in Tokyo handles about twice the number of visitors and inquiries it did six months ago . The Brussels offices of MITI and the Japan External Trade Organization , or Jetro , are flooded with inquiries . At a Jetro seminar for Japanese businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 300 came , " says Katsuo Seiki , director of MITI ' s West Europe division . Some analysts say such preparation means Japanese companies won ' t fall behind , even if they start late . Government encouragement usually helps galvanize Japanese industry . And industry analysts say that , while Japanese companies may be slower to form a strategy , they move quickly once the strategy is set . Many leading companies are confident they can build on investments they have already made in Europe . Sony Corp. , for example , says expansion is just part of its long-term strategy . Sony already produces its most popular consumer-electronics products in Europe and has design and research and development offices there . Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. , which just completed its 13th European factory , says Europe will account for 20% of its total overseas production in 1988 , nearly triple the 1980 level . " We ' ll continue this policy regardless of what 1992 becomes , " says Akira Nagano , a Matsushita spokesman . But such general plans mightn ' t be failsafe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions have established themselves in Europe , but reciprocal access to the Japanese market may be required for Japanese banks and securities firms to enjoy the full benefits of an EC base . In manufacturing , tariffs or quotas on products from non-EC European countries , or steep local-content requirements could be imposed , the EC says . Europe 1992 won ' t be " like an orchard where everyone can just rush in and snatch the fruits from the trees to one ' s heart ' s content , " the head of the EC delegation in Tokyo , Andreas van Agt , said recently . Europe wouldn ' t allow Japan to take advantage of the situation to increase its market share without further opening the Japanese market to European products , he said . Auto companies face a particularly tough battle because they threaten European auto makers . EC members have yet to agree on what will count as an EC product . Nissan , for example , has met the EC ' s 60% local content requirements at its U.K. manufacturing plant , and intends to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it recently blocked Nissan ' s British exports . Honda Motor Co. is seeking another way around the debate . This year it began importing cars made in the U.S. back to Japan , and is considering exporting from the U.S. to Europe . " The local content of our Ohio-built cars will be 63% by the end of this year , and it will reach 75% before too long , " says Honda president Tadashi Kume . " After we attain that 75% , if the Europeans start claiming that these aren ' t American cars but Japanese cars , we can say , ' Why ? On what grounds ?
