Schroeder 's joviality and fast recovery astound his doctors <P> The metal-and-plastic heart whirred and clicked in an eerie , mechanical rhythm as Dr. William DeVries , 40 , removed the tracheal tube from his patient 's throat . For the first time since his artificial heart had been implanted about 36 hours earlier , William Schroeder , 52 , could breathe on his own and speak . " Can I get you something to drink ? " the doctor asked . Replied Schroeder : " I 'd like a beer . " It was , DeVries admitted afterward , one of the high points of the tension-filled hours following his second successful attempt to implant an artificial heart . <P> Schroeder had to settle for a glass of ice chips , but that did not dampen his spirits . Later he demanded to know the time . " Six o'clock , " replied DeVries . Schroeder looked skeptically at the lanky surgeon who had saved his life , pointed to a clock on the wall and wagged a finger . Wrong , he said . The clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> No question about it , less than two days after undergoing two arduous operations , Bill Schroeder , a retired Government quality-control inspector from Jasper , Ind. , was as sharp as a tack and feeling frisky . <P> By week 's end the world 's second recipient of an artificial heart was getting out of bed and sitting in a chair , eating solid foods-warm porridge and cottage cheese-and sipping that longed-for beer , which he promptly dubbed " the Coors cure . " Well-wishers had sent cases of the Colorado brew and other brands , in addition to crateloads of cards , plants and bouquets , even a Cabbage Patch doll . <P> On Friday Schroeder tested a new portable power system for the artificial heart . For 22 minutes in the afternoon , and an hour later that evening , he was free of the 323-lb. , air-driven unit that normally runs the heart , and was hooked up to a small , 11-Ib. device encased in a leather shoulder bag . The portable system worked flawlessly though there were two breathless 3-sec. intervals when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other . Afterward , Schroeder thanked the inventor of the device , Engineer Peter Heimes of Aachen , West Germany , and shook his hand . Then he asked for some ice cream . <P> Doctors at Louisville 's Humana Hospital Audubon were astounded by Schroeder 's rapid progress and by his good humor , which , noted Dr. Allan Lansing , medical director of the hospital 's heart institute , " is more important in his recovery than most medicines . " <P> Even when he was wincing in pain as attendants tried to weigh him , Schroeder managed to get off a ones-liner . " I 'm going to remember this , " she griped at the staff . " I want the name of everybody in this room , starting with the big guy , " he said , I pointing at the 6-ft. , 5-in . DeVries . In the view of Schroeder 's wife of 32 years , Margaret , her husband appeared to be " more comfortable " last week " than he had been for months before the implant .
