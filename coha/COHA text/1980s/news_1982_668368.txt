These days , in a non-professional capacity , the bulk of my moviegoing is done at the quadraplex Hanover Mall Cinema which is managed by a quiet , self- effacing , little man known to me only as Mr. Mahoney ( the Hanover Mall is close to my home turf ) . I first met Mr. Mahoney during the 1970s when , over a five years spell , I served as The Globe ' s double-punch movie and drama critic and did some of my critical moviegoing at the Hanover Mall Cinema which is run by the General Cinema Corporation . Now there happens to be an unwritten law , a strict code of sorts , among critics whether the art ( ahem ! ) they practice finds focus on the silver screen or on the simple stage . No one - no one ! - neither friend nor stranger - is allowed to ask what you think ( or even hint the first breath of a question ) during or after a movie or a play . Admittedly the code presents an unreal , if not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood is popcorn and companionability . I take movies easier now that I ' m not reviewing them , often going so far as to talk back to them , certainly going as far as discussing them hot at the moment with my friends . But in the old days , in the grutch trade so-to-speak , I kept my churlish silence , kept it inviolate . . . until I met Mr. Mahoney and his sometime **31;216;TOOLONG lady Florence Bannon . Invariably at the Hanover Cinema , on those wake-up matinees when I ' d be surveying the screen , Mr. Mahoney and/or Florence would be somewhere in the complex going about their duties . Usually at these early shows ( which I far preferred over press screenings where the air was often black with critical murmurings ) , there would be only a handful of moviegoers , although there were occasions - the blockade booking of " Jaws , " for example - when the place would be full and humming . After the movies had unreeled , I ' d tack my way up the aisle and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes , Florence Bannon - waiting for me . Arms crossed against his chest , hands flapped one over the other like a pair of gloves , and looking like Alfred Hitchcock but more approachable than dour , Mr. Mahoney would say , " What ' d you think ? Any good ? " The friendliness behind Mr. Mahoney ' s direct approach always gained him an answer while - completely unknown to him - the code of stern critics crumbled around my stringent soul . Once Florence Bannon abandoned the popcorn machine and tracked me out the door , her simple question , " Should I see it ? I heard it was just OK . . . ? " In a sense this critically beguiling relationship among Mr. Mahoney , Florence Bannon and me reached a climax last week when I went to see " E.T. , the Extra-Terrestrial . " Challenged into wholesale skepticism by the apparent unaniminity of the reviews ( everyone from Pauline Kael to Newsweek to Timeto The Globe , all wrapped in a prose of wonderment ) , I was ready to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , if anyone asked ) . But within - perhaps - three minutes Steven Spielberg had me in his storytelling grasp . And , sure , I had heard all the references to James M. Barrie and " The Wizard of Oz ; " had heard how " E.T . " was a particular fantasy for our time and space ; how it was a latterday fairytale for a world no longer capable of believing in either latterdays or old-sense fairies . Going in I knew all that . And I was beguiled . Utterly , truly beguiled . Midway through " E.T . " when Spielberg ' s little monster learned to rasp out a guttural English word or two , I was as moved by his struggle as I might have been had I been observing the dawn of civilization only , of course , E.T . turned out to be far more civilized than the humanoids clanking around him . ( Has anyone mentioned , by the way , the male mutant resemblance this gracelessly graceful little creature has to Audrey Hepburn : that long neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but pure white Hepburn in all his yearning . ) Later my involvement in his separation from his people in outer space , his single-minded desire to return to where he truly belonged moved me to . . . tears . Near the end of " E.T . " I was weeping so long so steadily I was sure my ankles would drown . When E.T . first learned to say " phone , " then later croaked out that simplest - and most profound of words - " home , " the gulp in my throat damned near suffocated me . The sadness in E.T . ' s great goopy eyes tells us that he must - somehow - learn how to phone home and arrange a space ship pick-up . The sadness also details his eventual separation from little Elliott who has so bravely protected him from avenging , clinical , fascist forces . E.T . has one desire : to be back where he belongs in the spiralling Beyond , to be craning his green , jack-in-the-box neck with the rest of his amiable lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal , and perhaps the prime reason I was so affected , why all of us - if I may - are so moved by the movie , and by a simple childlike movie at that . " E.T . ' s " power has everything to do - I think - with the word " home , " and I don ' t mean to minimalize Spielberg ' s imagination ( or the stretch of his fantasy ) to a single concept . The movie is not strictly about " home " in the nostalgic sense of what has been lost in moving through time , through space , although it is about the loss of bearings , the terrible threat of being captured in a heartless terrain where individuality ( read , oddity ) marks you an outsider . There really is a wider , more beckoning " home " behind it all : home where we want to live , and yearn to be ; home where the harshness of reality is comforted by shared dreams ; home where heartache is passingly balanced with happiness ; home as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now for the world but still worth the phone call , still worth the struggle no matter how long and dangerous the shuttle . Anyway , at the end of " E.T. , " striving for critical equilibrium , muffing my mouth with by-now shredded Kleenex , I simply glanced ( what I hoped was a cold , non-commital glance ) at my friend next to me , started out of my seat , up the aisle . Pretending I was making a quick exit for a supposed deadline , and fooling whom I had no idea , I was caught in the traffic . Everyone around me seemed sniffly but happy . I was still having trouble with gulping . I mumbled something to my friend about Friendly ' s double-dark chocolate on the way home , and the word unbrooked a flood in my eyes . Reaching for support on the corrugated hallway that enters the theater , I looked up and saw Mr. Mahoney , arms folded across his chest , studying the crowd , as his eyes sent out a posse for the critic in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was being moved in a phalanx smack against his interrogating presence , a confrontation that couldn ' t be avoided . What would he think if he saw me red-eyed , nose running ? What if he shook my hand and felt me trembling ? " Well , what ' d you think ? " he said . " Audiences love it . Really grabs them . . . you like it ? " The most I could do was act out an assent by shaking my head . Mr. Mahoney wanted more . " What ' d you think , " he asked again , persistent , not to be easily bartered . Almost gasping , certainly close to incoherent , my voice a grating whisper I couldn ' t identify as my own , I said , " Mr. Mahoney , tell Florence . . . I . . . have to . . . have to . . . PHONE HOME , PHONE HOME ! " As much as I wanted to explain myself , or wanted to comfort Mr. Mahoney ' s certain dismay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back if my life depended upon it . Outside I looked up at the sky ; dark , it seemed to glow ; I wanted to hurl a bottle-with-a- message for Mr. Mahoney and Florence Bannon into the night ' s immensity . This is that message .
