He strives to prove he is tough enough to be President <P> Looking to the presidential campaign , this article begins a series to appear periodically during 1983 probing the character and personality of each of the major candidates . <P> Perhaps it is Walter Mondale 's fate that much of his recent life has been devoted to wiping out a public confession made nine years ago . As political farewells go , his was extraordinary . A man who set out to become President decided to toss it all and tell the world openly , astonishingly , that he lacked the determination to seek the biggest job Americans have to offer . " I do not have the overwhelming desire to be President , " said Mondale . <P> The statement was so incredibly honest , so human , that it might have installed Mondale in some kind of political Hall of Fame . Who else had ever pulled the trigger on himself so winningly ? The statement set off other reactions too . People who scorned that kind of political immolation thought Mondale had shown an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mondale 's former colleague and a man who has also been accused of being a quitter , later expressed his own savage view : Mondale had the soul of a Vice President . <P> But most were ready to take Mondale at his word .

He eagerly set out to become Jimmy Carter 's Vice President , and made it . Now , in the early spring of 1983 , he somehow had revived his presidential reputation . Here he was , leading all the Democratic candidates by a wide margin , and running ahead of Ronald Reagan too . He held the institutional center of the Democratic Party in his grasp . Now he stood in front of audiences volunteering that back in 1974 he had simply not been ready . " What I 'm telling you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President now . " <P> But even as he kept gathering support-and this is where the story of Walter Mondale takes on more haunting proportions-the old self-doubt kept creeping in . Telltale signs of the well-known Mondale shilly-shallying began showing up . He fumbled his relationship with his former boss , Jimmy Carter . And he warily navigated his way through the party 's numerous interest blocs , careful to offend no one . Like his own captive party , he seemed more bound up in special interests than in national interests . Maybe , political observers said to themselves , he was right about himself the first time .
