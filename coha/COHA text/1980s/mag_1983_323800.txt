China After Mao <P> To the Editors : <P> I admired Theodore H. White 's frankness and vividness in describing the events in China both present and past Sept. 26 . I am of Taiwanese background and was reared on propaganda against China . After I came to the U.S. , I perceived the difference between reality and hyperbole . Nevertheless , the pride of Taiwan equals the pride of mainland China . Taiwan should be left alone . <P> Amy Lai <P> Amherst , Ohio <P> White 's extraordinary article on China is like the exquisite Oriental vases I often associate with that country : massive , colorful , delicate yet powerfully poignant . <P> Jacqueline Scapin <P> Paris <P> The report on China was fascinating . It is obvious that America and the world can not ignore this " sleeping giant . " <P> Scott Golding <P> Austin <P> The Cultural Revolution and Mao 's earlier blunders were not China 's whole revolutionary experience , as White seems to suggest . Nor should the downfall of the Gang of Four be interpreted to mean that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to imply that an industrialized China may not work to the world 's good . Have we no ideas for working in harmony with developing economies ? Anyone who has properly analyzed recent changes inside China must conclude that its socialist system is there to stay . China has developed into a state ordered by Marxist-Leninist-Maoist thought . Please do not try to sell China to the American people by suggesting otherwise . <P> Robin A. Ball <P> Leeds , England <P> Kudos to Theodore White for his touching yet analytical portrait of China in transition . I recently returned from a visit to the homeland that I had never seen . Although its proliferating population remains China 's greatest obstacle to modernization , I agree with White that human envy and appetite are potentially equally dangerous perils . While walking down a bustling Shanghai boulevard , I encountered a swarm of people surrounding a street merchant . What was the object of everyone 's smiling fascination ? A Rubik 's Cube . <P> The Chinese people have followed an austere life-style for so long that their desire for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to succeed in his Four Modernizations , he may have to suppress consumerism . The task of industrial progress will require that China 's limited exchange be spent wisely . Rubik 's Cubes , and similar products , may be the wrench in the cogs of China 's revitalization . <P> Peter C. Ho <P> New Haven , Conn . <P> White 's article presents Mao as a devilish dictator who would kill millions to enhance his power . Mao is worse . He is in the same class as Hitler . The Chinese would be wise to scrap his thoughts entirely if they wish to achieve peace and move ahead economically . The U.S. , on the other hand , would benefit from helping China to modernize . When China 's economic standards reach those of the West , there is a chance that the Chinese may discard the Communist system and become a major force in the free world . <P> Owen M.
