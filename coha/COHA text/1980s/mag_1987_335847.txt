At first glance , Moscow this summer looks much as it has for decades : office workers queuing up at street-side ice cream stands , red-kerchiefed flocks of Young Pioneers fidgeting in the mile-long line outside Lenin 's Tomb , old women sweeping courtyards with twig-bundle brooms , faded red signs proclaiming VICTORY TO COMMUNISM . But beneath the capital 's seedy , socialist exterior there is an unaccustomed hum of excitement . Passersby pore over posted copies of Moscow News , marveling at articles on ( gasp ! ) official corruption and incompetence . Once banned abstract paintings hang at an outdoor Sunday art fair . In public parks and private living rooms , families plan futures that many believe will be better , richer , freer than ever before . To the delight of many Soviet citizens  --  and the dismay of others  --  their country is in the midst of its most dramatic transformation since the days of Stalin . <P> Mikhail Gorbachev 's calls for glasnost ( openness ) , * demokratizatsiya ( democratization ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) have become the watchwords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic machinery and revitalize a society stultified by 70 years of totalitarian rule . In televised addresses , speeches to the party faithful and flesh- pressing public appearances  --  often with his handsome wife Raisa  --  he has spread his gospel of modernization . Translating his words into action , he is streamlining the government bureaucracy , reshuffling the military , moving reform-minded allies into the party leadership and allowing multicandidate elections at the local level . He has loosened restrictions on small-scale free enterprise and introduced the profit principle in state-owned industries . His policy of openness has encouraged the press to speak out more freely and produced an unprecedented thaw in the country 's intellectual and cultural life . In the human-rights field , scores of political prisoners have been freed and the rate of Jewish emigration has been increasing  --  to 3,092 for the first half of this year , up sharply from last year 's level but far below the peak of 51,320 in 1979 . <P> For all his innovations , the Soviet leader has hardly , at 56 , become a convert to Western-style democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply believes in the tenets of Marx and Lenin . His goal is not to scrap that system but to save it from permanent economic decline through a series of bold , pragmatic measures . As he told a gathering of editors and propagandists in Moscow on July 10 : " We intend to make socialism stronger , not replace it with another system . " <P> Gorbachev 's rejuvenating crusade raises the question of whether he can achieve durable change without provoking insurmountable opposition from party conservatives and fearful bureaucrats . After all , Nikita Khrushchev was swept from power 23 years ago for attempting reforms far less daring than Gorbachev 's . More recently , when Deng Xiaoping 's economic liberalization in China began to spill over into the political sphere , hard-liners rose up and forced the ouster of reformist Communist Party Chief Hu Yaobang early this year . Even if such internal party opposition does not stop Gorbachev , how far can he push change without unleashing democratic forces that could ultimately destabilize Soviet society ? Mindful of that danger , Gorbachev warned the editors and propagandists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
