txt THE OUTLOOK for interest rates has become a lot less certain than it was a month or so ago . Rates are still edging down and the Federal Reserve Board has n't done anything to by to turn them back up . But some economists are n't so sure they 're going to slide much more . The questioning of Fed policy , which could affect the length and depth of the recession as well as the recovery and Inflationary push that follows it , is not noticeable in two places . One Is the overseas currency markets , where the dollar periodically goes on a tear . The other is the market for new bond offerings , lately in the midst of one of its biggest booms . Over the last couple of months , corporations have heed out to borrow billions  --  and their investment bankers are n't trying to slow them down . ONE OF THE most active firms recently hos been Morgan , Stanley &; Co , Inc. , a blue chip among investment bankers . Erich Heinemann , the firm 's expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific advice he 's given to clients . Ile does say , though , that although he thinks interest rates are likely to get to lower levels , there is n't reason to wait if there 's a need for the money now . " As you get closer to the underlying inflation rate in the economy , the progress to lower interest rates becomes much more volatile and uneven , " Heine'num told us . " The trend is still to lower rates , but you have to think of how much they will go down , how long it will take , and the chances of an upward spike in die meantime . " HEINEMANN SEES the possibility that the Fed will pick a spot to halt or slow the decline in rates , possibly to prevent a sharp pick-up in the use of credit or to help shore up the duller in currenvniarkins . Kandel/ Greer " Excessive restraint during 11 ) 80 could be the , harbinger of excessive ease in 1981 and beyond , " he said , " which is just what happened the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fed is too tight on the downside , it 's also going to be too free on the upside . " So far , Heinemann said , the prime lending rate at banks seems to be higher than it should be , since the bank 's basic cost of money  --  the federal funds rate is moving steadily lower . At the bottom , he thinks , that rate should be around CPA percent . According to most economic figuring , that would put a " reasonable " prime rate at about 8 per cent , although Heinemann has some question of whether it will get that low . PIERRE RINFRET does n't believe the prime will get that low , He thinks the likelihood of any significant spike is small and does n't think the prime will work below 0 per cent . Once it gets there , he says , it could , stay around that level for quite a while  --  maybe until this time next year . The reason the banks ' base lending rate wo n't go any lower , he says , Is that current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit  --  one way or another , no matter who is elected President In November  --  and put strong upward pressure on the credit markets , enough to balance the lack of demand for credit that he expects as a result of the rens sion . BINFRET ALSO SAID , " The Inflialo# rate has turned out to be very sticky around 10 per cent . That 's one thing that will govern the level of interest rates . There 's going to be another push of inflation . Look what 's happening in the southern United ptates , with a drought that 's going to push farm prices up . That 's something the Fed has n't ' been figuring on . " There 's going to be a federal budget deficit of at least VA billion this fiscal year and at least $80 billion In fiscal 1981 , even without a tax cut . That 's going to put a lot of pressure on the lending markets . So I 've been telling my clients that if you need money now , or if you 're going to need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so worried about the Interest rate as I am about the availability . " Rinfret says the same advice he 's giv ? ing to his clients is good for consumers . " If you 're going to need to borrow money , borrow it , now . It may not be no easy to find later .
