L ikely prospect for a heart attack ? It could n't happen to me . I am a non-smoker , thin , and sort of a physical fitness nut . I play strenuous tennis and never use the elevator in the hospitals in which I operate . As a practicing surgeon in LaJolla , California , I worked hard but also realized that ex  --  ercise was important tome . It relieved tension that built up in my demanding profession . I do n't have diabetes , I drink sparingly ( a little wine at night ) and have no family history of heart disease , other than my mother , who suf  --  fered a mild heart attack in her middle 60s . I do not have hypertension , and my weight is the same as it was at age 19 . However , with all these ad  --  vantages , I still had the at  --  tack and I was faced with a decision : treatment with medication or coronary bypass surgery . I might emphasize here that with all the stair running and vigorous running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . My single episode was in the middle of the night . Awakening from a sound sleep , I felt a crushing pain beneath my breast  --  bone , radiating to my left hand , which at that moment felt some  --  what numb . Trying to discount it , I drew a couple of deep breaths and turned on my side . There was afeeling of impending doom , and I was sure this had to be almost typical angina . I knew that I must get to the hospital in the event of a massive infarction , or heart muscle death , which in turn leads to car  --  diac arrest . I knew that if this were to happen , I would have a good chance of survival with cardio  --  pulmonary resuscitation done by anyone trained in the procedure . I quietly awoke my wife and , as calmly as I could , told her I was having a heart attack . She began to hyperventilate , but she arose and began to dress hurriedly . Would you believe that I went to the bathroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! At this point she almost had a stroke and quickly led me to the car . Dur ing the drive to the hospital the pain eased slightly , and I kept taking deep breaths , hoping to oxygenate my heart muscle as best I could , and praying that I would not have a cardiac arrest before getting to the hospital . When we arrived at the emergency room entrance , I strode through the doors , flopped on a bed and told the startled nurse what I had . The young emergency room doc tor was busily engaged with a dying two-year-old boy in the next bed . He managed to get over to start an IV on me , then returned to the child , since by now my pain had almost gone . I asked the nurse to give me intravenous Valium be cause I knew I would get violently ill with morphine . I had experi enced that a few years before when my back was thrown out . I also asked her to get the lab to draw blood for a complete blood count and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it indicates heart muscle Continued on page , 76 damage . By this time , I was being hooked up to the EKG machine . I told the nurse to get me the cardi  --  ologist on call . I knew them all and trusted them , so it did n't matter which one came . All this went on with the young physician taking care of the child in the next bed . As it turned out , the cardiologist who appeared was also the specialist who does the angiograms . He took over . By then , my pain had dis  --  appeared . After two days , my tests , in  --  cluding repeat EKG and enzyme studies , all showed normal . Then came what I thought would be the acid test : the stress EKG . An old cardi  --  ologist friend came back on duty the day after my attack and felt we should go ahead with the test . Dave is a premier cardi  --  ologist , in fact the first man west of the Mississip  --  pi to get his sub-specialty board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the hospital prior to my stress test , and I was eager to find out if I indeed had " the disease . " They put me on the treadmill and brought my pulse up to 180 beats per minute , and it was all normal ! That night Fred , who had ad  --  mitted me , came in and we talked about the normal stress EKG . By this time , I had called my wife to bring my clothes in the morning . However , Fred said , " Walt , tell me again about the original pain you had . " " Fred , as far as I 'm concerned , this was angina and not heart  --  burn . " I wonder if a nonmedical man , hearing his stress EKG was normal and never having had a previous attack , would have under  --  played the pain and talked the car  --  diologist into letting him go home . Fred said , " If what you say is true , I think we should get an angi  --  ogram . " An angiogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg artery and running it up to the origin of the coronary arteries , injecting them with dye . In about 35 minutes under local anesthesia and a little IV Valium , the study was done . I know Fred so well , I did n't get the bedside approach . He came around in front of me while I was still on the table and said , " Well , Mert , you 've got the disease . Three vessels are blocked . One is 95 per  --  cent shut off , the second is 80 per cent closed and there is a 75 per  --  cent closure of the third . " Just like that . He knew I was n't a person to panic and he knew I 'd hound him for answers . I got them . " Fred , with my extensively blocked coronary arteries , how come I did n't have anginal attacks with physical stress ? " " Because you 're in good shape , you have no infarcted heart mus  --  cle , and the muscle was strong enough to push the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you asleep and with slowedblood flow and shallow breathing , the muscle was n't adequately sup  --  plied with blood and oxygen , and the heart muscle went into spasm . " The angiogram is the most im  --  portant tool we have in finding out the exact status of the coronary arteries . If any decision is to be made at all regarding surgery , nothing can be done until the angiogram has been performed . It will show how many vessels are blocked ; if the arteries are blocked in their entire length , that patient is not a candidate for bypass surgery . With the entire coronary artery occluded , there is no good distal segment of artery to hook into with a graft . With the information had from my angiograms , I was faced with the deci  --  sion of being treated medi  --  cally or having bypass surgery . Unfortunately , there has been confusing publicity in the media regarding the manage  --  ment of coronary artery disease . The VA hospital report indicated that their 2 ' /2- to 3-year study showed that surgical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the cases they treated with medica  --  tion . Being a surgeon , I was curious of this study , and felt I must review the original paper written by the VA physicians . I also felt it necessary to review the authors ' works and give both sides a fair appraisal . I was surprised to find that the surgical results of the VA study were markedly different from those of other large centers . What the media failed to point out from the VA study was a 6 per  --  cent operative mortality , ( patients who die within seven days after surgery ) , compared to a 2 percent operative mortality at all other centers . The VA cited a 31 percent clotting of their bypass grafts Continued on page 38 // within 16 to 30 months . Other authors came up with 12 percent clotting of their grafts over a five-to seven-year period . Small won  --  der , with the premature reporting and the less than ideal surgical re  --  sults , that the VA study would conclude that in their hands , surgi  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with medi  --  cation . It was also pointed out by other authors that their operative cases included poor-risk patients , whereas the VA hospital group were highly selected good-risk cases . Still , the VA surgical group came in a poor second in survivor statistics . With a personal review of the literature and the angiogram evidence of marked obstruction of three of my coronary after  --  ies , I chose surgery . Things moved rapidly after my decision for sur  --  gery . Within 36 hours I had my triple bypass . The cardiac surgeon used my leg vein for two bypasses and the internal mammary artery from beneath my sternum for the third bypass . Studies have shown that in contrast to the VA study , there is an 88 percent patency ( i.e. , open and functioning in vein grafts and a 98 per  --  cent patency in artery grafts over a five-year follow-up period . It is curious to find now , after my surgery , the large number of people who have had bypass grafts as long as seven and eight years ago who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the operation and many changes have occurred in my life , both psychological and physio  --  logical . The first month after surgery I was almost in a state of euphoria , having survived the original attack and also the sur  --  gery . However , one week after my bypass , another man my age had the same operation at the same hospital done by the same skillful surgeon , and he developed an infec  --  tion in the operative wound and died a month later . Six weeks after my return home I had sudden chest pain and faint  --  ness and was rushed to the hospi  --  tal , sure that my grafts had plugged off . The diagnosis was per  --  icarditis , an inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart . I was discharged the next day on cor  --  tisone pills . I had never really been conscious of my health before , but after two frightening episodes of chest pain I became a " heart crock . " Nights I could n't sleep were terrible . A pain in my chest or numbness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only added to my anxiety . Because of the inflamed heart sac , my pulse stayed at 120 beats per minute for more than two months . This hin  --  dered my brisk walking and get  --  ting back to tennis . Earlier in my convalescence , my cardiologist insisted I go to a psychiatrist . What did he think Iwas , a nut ? I did n't need a shrink ; I needed to get stronger physically and return to sports and work ! What I did n't realize was that studies of many bypass patients showed the alarming number of men who , after successful surgery , did n't want to go back to work . Many had lost that drive and incentive which most likely had given them their disease in the first place . Reluctantly , I went to the psychiatrist , who was kindly , a good listener and , to my surprise , a very normal guy . Unfor  --  tunately , I had known a few who were a bit strange and I assumed that most of them were sort of far out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied neurotic com  --  plaints . This very normal-acting physician talked with me about my plans for the future . Was I going to slow down , even change the type of practice 1 had been doing ? Of course , I was gung ho , macho , about go  --  ing back to surgery , but I would " control " it . I would not operate nights or week  --  ends . I had it all planned . His eyes seemed to twinkle a bit , and he said that sounded fine and to see him again in a month or so . The first two and one-half months following my surgery , it rained , and rained . . and rained . The depression began as a creeping thing . I was sleeping less at night . I hated those sleepless nights because of the occasional pain under my breastbone or the numb  --  ness in my hand . It was dark and quiet , and I was frightened . Come on , you dummy ! I said to myself . What 's there to be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it was suc  --  cessful ? Remember , before the operation I had no pain during physical activity  --  only once in the // middle of the night . Twice I went back to the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon . I suggested get  --  ting another angiogram to see if my grafts were still open . Instead , they gave me two separate tread  --  mill tests , both of which were nor  --  mal . But my stress test was nor  --  mal before my surgery , too ! My doctors told me it was n't nec  --  essary to have an angiogram at this time unless I could truthfully document what they would consid  --  er defined anginal attacks . They indicated the .1 percent mortality and 1 percent morbidity of angi  --  ograms . I decided I was overreact  --  ing and that I must get my mind and body geared to being well . I started hitting tennis balls with my son even though my pulse was still 110 to 120 beats per minute . Gradually over the next month ( the fourth month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cises and my pulse dropped to 100 . After hitting tennis balls with my wife and son another week or so , I felt I was ready for a little easy competitive club doubles . It was pathetic . My reflexes were awful . The quick lateral moves were gone . I missed shots at the net which should have been easy put-aways . My son would whisper , " Dad , you 're not moving ! " When six months passed , my cardiologist did another treadmill test and pronounced me a well man . Other than my still-rapid pulse of 90 , I felt quite well physically . Why did I resent his telling me I was ready for work ? As much as I had always loved my practice , I suddenly was angry with my doctor who told me I was ready . That week , I voluntarily sought the psychiatrist 's advice and coun  --  sel . During the discussion , I told him how I helped my depression by writing and by visiting three friends of mine who had various stages of cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable cure . I 'd take them for drives and we 'd go out to lunch . I derived some strength from these great fellows who had such a poor prognosis but great courage . One of these fine men had his arm and entire shoulder removed because of his advancing disease and , as long as he can navigate , he runs a " Living with Cancer " group and speaks all over the country . I felt I did some  --  thing for all of us by calling on them , showing interest in them . It 's sad to see how quickly people forget a sick person ; frequently these men were very much alone . My involvement with them got me out of my depression temporarily . I went back to surgery just week  --  days and no nights . This lasted about a month  --  then I was back to seven days a week and late evening rounds . I began to " jump " when the phone rang at home . I became irritable and slowly increased my wine intake at night . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drinking . " Why , I only have three or four glasses at night . What 's wrong with that ? " She told me to measure the amount in the glass I used . It turned out to be 250 cc . I was consuming over one quart of wine per night . No wonder I 'd fall asleep over the evening paper by seven . I became totally exhausted with the seven-day-a-week program . I began to canvass my two local hospitals as to the possibility of assisting in surgery and not having the responsibility of caring for pa  --  tients myself . We had college tui  --  tions and numerous other financial responsibilities to meet , but I figured I could do it . I would have less stress but still be in the operating room which I enjoyed so much . I sold the office and equip  --  ment and embarked on my new ca  --  reer . . . of being number two . I became a universal donor in the operating room , helping all the var  --  ious surgical specialists in differ  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to neurosurgery ( which I do n't understand ) . It became obvious after two months of this that two things were happening . I was n't making enough money to handle all my financial responsibilities , and nobody was telling me how great I was . Oh , the nurses would occa  --  sionally report the surgeon 's com  --  ments about what a good assistant I was , but to me that was n't enough . I did n't want to do a lot of surgery , but enough to satisfy my ego and to really help people through the frightening periods of pre- and post-op care . I 've always felt many surgeons ' visits are too quick , too impersonal . Part of my exhaustion in a busy practice was that I spent considerable time with my patients and often suffered with them and with their families . The cancer patients always hit me the hardest , and 80 percent of my surgery was on cancer . Surviving after heart surgery be- comes a mental and physical tug of war , a war I am still waging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of my life ? Have I become too concerned about my- self ? Do I " owe myself " some selfish pleasures , moving into a " pad " and taking a sabbatical from marriage ? What will this do to a lovely , thoughtful wife who has put up with me all these years ? Should I tell the children ( all over 18 ) to start taking care of themselves for a change ? Survival , then , means developing a disciplined approach to reality . The mind needs constant read- justing and the patient must never cease to care . Getting wrapped up in himself can change a per- son 's life style completely . It can be a very lonely ex- istence . I have not solved this inner struggle , but I 'm trying , reaching out and caring about others ' needs and feelings . But I must temper it , because I become too involved with everyone 's problems , trying too hard , not wanting to be disliked by anyone . I was trying too hard . The other part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather extensively and I believe I have some fairly sound information I wish to pass on . Everyone is aware of the jogging craze which has swept the country . I say craze , because there are many individuals who are overdoing it . We are all not really creak . equal , at least not physically , and what is good for one can actually be harm-ful for another . Valid studies show that jogging has helped decrease depression , increase stamina for work and play and , very important  --  ly , change the lipid ( fat ) levels in the blood . Unfortunately , there has arisen a strange type of addiction to running . Runners begin to feel almost guilty if they do n't run every day . Then they increase their mileage . People have told me when they miss a day they get de  --  pressed . Others have had various knee , muscle and foot injuries . One jogger developed a terrible foot in  --  fection . She had been told earlier to stay off her feet and take the anti  --  biotics prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . Had she been staying off her feet ? Well , no , she had reduced her jogging to six miles a day ! When told she had to get off her feet completely or be admitted to the hospital , she shook her head and almost whispered , " I do n't think I can do it . " I 'm sure you have noted long-distance jog  --  gers who have aged ten years be  --  cause of abnormal loss of body fat . Of course , in the middle-aged and older group , the face is the first to suffer . I 'm not decrying jogging . When properly performed it has to be the most efficient and cheapest way to stay totally fit . It turns out that jogging has definitely improved the fat levels in the blood . Studies by Dr. G. Harting , assistant pro  --  fessor of physical medicine at Baylor University , found that low-mileage joggers had as good a level of certain fats in the blood as the high-mileage jogger . His findings proved that run  --  ning three miles three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and lowered the cholesterol and trigly  --  ceride level as efficiently as the 50-mile-a-week run  --  ner . Let us go briefly into the explanation of HDL and LDL . Cholesterol is a fatty substance which does not mix with water , thus the blood ca n't carry it . Therefore , to carry choles  --  terol and other fats from the liver to other organs , the body attaches them to proteins that can dissolve in the blood serum . Fats are known chemically as lipids , and the fat/protein combinations are called lipoproteins . Researchers discovered in the past few years there are two types of lipoproteins in our blood . They are high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein . Surpris  --  ingly , it was found that persons with a high HDL  --  people who were vegetarians , those whose families were known for longevity , and jog  --  gers  --  had very low incidence of coronary artery disease . It seems that LDL deposits cholesterol in the arteries , whereas HDL re  --  moves cholesterol from the sites where it is in excess and carries it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 122 So that 's the new message . Dr. Anderson is telling his story all over the country at one medical forum after another and was recently invited to present his data at a summit con  --  ference in Washington , D.C. , to deter  --  mine recommendations to be made to the President and Congress concerning future directions in treating diabetes . Recently , he also spoke in California at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association . To Dr. Anderson go our admiration for his great work and our hopes for what he will be discovering in the future . We give a bow to the humble oat , originally a grain from western Europe which has now spread all over the world . The Scots , we now know , were right all along . And Dr. Johnson , distin  --  guished lexicographer though he was , must now hang his head in that heaven of polysyllables he now inhabits . s To find recipes for good-tasting high-fiber foods , turn to page 106 . Bypass continued from page 40 put it simply , HDL seems to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California at San Francisco research group have now come up with a medical regime for the management of the low-HDL high  --  LDL victim . One drug , Colestepol , re  --  duces the cholesterol levels because it binds bile acids , a breakdown product of cholesterol , thus triggering a string of reactions which lowers cholesterol levels . Nicotinic acid , the vitamin niacin , inhibits formation in the liver of lipoproteins , the large molecules that transport cholesterol . Investigations by Miller and Hamil  --  ton from Tulane University School of Medicine and by W.B. Parsons show that nicotinic acid can alter the lipids in the blood rather dramatically . Their studies indicate that 1 gram of nico  --  tinic acid taken with each meal signifi  --  cantly lowers the LDL . Further studies are in progress showing that this vita  --  min also has promise in raising the HDL . Nicotinic acid is not without side effects . Patients must build up to the dose of 3 grams daily . Marked flushing of the skin can be very annoying , and it can cause heartburn or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose over several weeks , take it with meals and use antacids when hy  --  peracidity symptoms are a factor . ( Editor 's note : For nutritional pre  --  ventive approach , see article about Dr. James Anderson , page .95 . ) After all the discussion of the physical , emotional and medical ap Continued on following page proaches to coronary artery disease , people want to know what I am doing . From a work standpoint , I 'm in a unique situation . I 've been in the com  --  community long enough that the referring physicians understand my attempt to cut back . They know I 'm assisting in surgery at a neighboring hospital and that I wish to hold down my own prac  --  tice to two cases per week . They 've ac  --  tually told me that if I 've already done two cases that particular week , they 'll try again the next week . How can you beat that sort of friendship and good will amongst your colleagues ? As to physical fitness , I admit I hate jogging and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know I 'll get up to that three-mile requirement . Again , its just a matter of discipline and survival  --  I am now playing vigor  --  ous singles tennis with no fatigue at all . It is a known fact that 5 grains of aspirin per day will reduce clotting in the arteries . This can be taken with breakfast . I 'm taking 250 milligrams of nicotinic acid three times daily in a long-acting form called disease . If you are in the range of the 40s or low 50s , you had better readjust your physical and emotional program , stop smoking , lose weight if you 're overweight , and start the nicotinic acid routine all under the guidance of your physician . Reduce the stress in your life , whether it be in the office or at home . Obviously , the jogging does n't begin until you 've been cleared with a stress test . Finally , if the stress test indicates there is coronary insufficiency , your cardiologist or personal physician may suggest an angiogram . If you recall the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severity of my coronary occlusive disease until I had the dye study . It is n't just survival we are seeking . It should be a joy of living each day . In order to accomplish this , you must en  --  joy your work , try a little kindness to casual friends and really know your family and their needs . Then perhaps some of that stress will subside , and you can truly enjoy a full life . v : Politics ' 80 continued from page 26 the press said he 'd lost the elec tion  --  and shortly afterward he was forced to drop out of the race . Sen ator Ed Muskie won the New Hamp shire primary in 1972 by an almost 2-to-1 margin over Senator George McGovern and saw the press insist that it was a grievous loss ; he lost momentum , personnel and money , and had to drop out of the race . The trick these days is to win the various polls and primaries without the media quite noticing that you 've won . For once they notice , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race . One tantalizing example came last October when Jimmy Carter won a 2-to-1 mar gin of victory over Ted Kennedy in a straw vote in Florida . In its news section hype for Senator Kennedy , the Washington Post printed a story on page four showing that , by the Post 's own measurements , Carter got 65 per cent of the vote and Kennedy got 31 percent . On page Nicobid , which has been easy on my stomach and caused almost no skin flushing . Since we know that serum cholesterol stud  --  ies are almost useless for people over 50 , that group must rely on the HDL-LDL ratio . Re  --  cently I repeated my lipid studies and was pleased to find my HDL was 68mgidl , which is well in the range of low coronary artery disease incidence . How about all of you between 35 and 60 years of age ? What should you be doing ? Remember that tennis really never helped pre  --  vent my coronary . You must have some sus  --  tained form of exercise . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jogging uses up to 675 calories in the same time period . I believe you should go to a reliable laboratory and get accurate measure  --  ment of your lipids . Go to two laboratories for comparison studies .
