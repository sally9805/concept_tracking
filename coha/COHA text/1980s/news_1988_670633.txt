Just how invigorating they can be was demonstrated one weekend earlier this month when the Society of Dance History Scholars held its 11th annual conference at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. // The three-day event was crammed with discussions , lecture-demonstrations and the presentation of scholarly papers . ( Katherine McGinnis Block supervised arrangements at the school for the conference , and programs were coordinated by Barbara Barker . ) Topics ranged from the deciphering of 17th-century dance notation to an exploration of American Yemenite Jewish dance . But most sessions were devoted to a common theme : the Ballets Russes - those international touring companies that flourished from 1909 , when Sergei Diaghilev founded his Ballets Russes , to 1962 , when Sergei Denham ' s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo disbanded . Between those years , various troupes under similar names toured the world and nurtured such choreographers as Michel Fokine , Vaslav Nijinsky , Leonide Massine , Bronislava Nijinska , Serge Lifar , David Lichine , George Balanchine and Agnes de Mille. // In addition to scholarly papers on the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by P. W. Manchester , a British-born critic who saw most of these groups , from the last seasons of the Diaghilev company onwards . Ann Barzel , a Chicago critic , showed films she had taken during Ballets Russes performances. // Rochelle Zide-Booth , a former member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo who teaches at Adelphi University , led a fascinating lecture-demonstration . Assisted by students from the North Carolina School of the Arts , she compared two versions of " Raymonda , " which Marius Petipa choreographed in 1898 . First , a student danced a solo as staged by Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova for a Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo revival in 1946 , the choreography of which was said to be " after Petipa . " Then another student performed the equivalent but choreographically different variation to the same music from " Pas de Dix , " a ballet of 1955 that was choreographically credited to Balanchine alone. // Glazunov ' s score for " Raymonda " often evokes Hungarian folk melodies , and the 1946 choreography contained movements for shoulders and arms akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 , however , the folk-dance references , though still present , were not as explicit , and the choreography was notable for its footwork . Both versions were beautiful , and both showed how Balanchine could borrow from traditional choreography and reshape it as he saw fit. // Another glimpse into the Ballets Russes repertory was provided by a concert at which students offered representative excerpts from " Les Sylphides , " " Firebird , " " The Nutcracker , " " Petrouchka , " " Concerto Barocco , " " The Sleeping Beauty " and " Graduation Ball . " The presentation revealed how versatile the members of the Ballets Russes troupes had to be , for the students were required to portray such diverse characters as a magic firebird , the spirit of winter , some Viennese military-school cadets and plump nursemaids and drunken coachmen shivering in a St. Petersburg winter. // The existence of organizations dedicated to dance history underscores the fact that dance is increasingly being accorded the same serious study that has long been given to painting , music , drama and literature . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancers and dance-lovers have sometimes taken a cavalier attitude toward their heritage . Now , however , the realization is dawning that dance has both a history that deserves to be recorded accurately and treasures that merit preservation. // One of this conference ' s more innovative features was the way it encouraged scholars and dancers to mingle . Many dancers have never attended college ; some are high-school dropouts . Therefore , dancers may feel intimidated by scholars , while scholars may fear that dancers are inarticulate . But the conference demonstrated that scholars need not be pompous and that dancers can speak lucidly . I , for one , was pleased to find Igor Youskevitch - one of our century ' s finest male dancers - in charge of a panel on choreography ; I was even more delighted to hear him deliver a carefully prepared speech about working with Balanchine . Mr. Youskevitch recalled how Balanchine choreographed a brilliant solo for him in " Theme and Variations " in only five minutes and how , when Balanchine , who possessed considerable musical training , wrote a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it note by note. // Other conferences should also bring dancers and scholars together , when appropriate . We have much to learn from one another . And much remains to be learned . There are huge gaps in our knowledge . For instance , what happened in the late 18th and early 19th centuries ? Usually , when they get to the 1780 ' s , dance-history teachers celebrate the triumph of a form of dramatic dance known as ballet d ' action . Next thing you know , however , they are applauding the Romanticism of the 1830 ' s . ( I have done this myself in my teaching . ) But what happened between , say , 1790 and 1830 ? Fortunately , this shadowy period is now being probed by historians , some of whom were at the conference. // People and events in our own century can seem equally shadowy . Thus , it might be useful to have a biography of Adolph Bolm , the Russian choreographer who , in the 1920 ' s and 30 ' s , founded major companies in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s that is worthy of study is Catherine Littlefield ' s Philadelphia Ballet . Although almost forgotten today , it was considered so important in its time that it danced at the Paris Exposition of 1937 , thereby becoming the first American ballet company to visit Europe. // The topics that await investigation often involve major creative figures and issues , and dance historians and historically-minded dancers speak of their research with enormous enthusiasm . They can talk all day . And , one evening at the conference , they threatened to dance all night . That was when , after dinner , dancers and scholars joined hands and swung one another in square dances to music by a bluegrass band. //
