In the eight years since the landmark Bakke case , the U.S. Supreme Court has tacked back and forth unpredictably on the issue of affirmative action , prompting Reagan Administration lawyers and liberal civil rights activists alike to claim that the results really favored them . Last week , in what may prove to be a decisive course marker , the court struck down by a 5-4 vote a Michigan school-district plan that sought to protect minority hiring gains by laying off white teachers ahead of blacks with less seniority . It was a decision with a bit of something for everyone . <P> The Reagan Administration could , and did , take satisfaction from the majority 's view that the mere fact of discrimination in American life is not in itself a constitutionally sufficient reason for resorting to an affirmative-action remedy . " It is a terrific opinion in our judgment , " said Justice Department Spokesman Terry Eastland . But after reviewing the splintered opinions , most experts agreed with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor . She concluded that the Justices have " forged a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim of the Reagan Administration . It has argued that affirmative action is appropriate only to remedy discrimination against specific individual victims . By O'Connor 's reading , however , the court is prepared to approve " a carefully constructed affirmative-action program , " which " need not be limited to the remedying of specific instances of identified discrimination . " <P> Whatever it meant in the larger struggle , the outcome meant victory for Wendy Wygant and the other white teachers who brought the suit after being laid off in 1981 . On hearing the news , she says , " we whooped it up a little . " Most had already been rehired , but they may now press for back pay . The layoff plan had been necessary , the Jackson board of education had contended , to assure enough minority role models for its minority students . Lewis Powell , joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and William Rehnquist plus O'Connor , disagreed . In their view , a minority preference plan could have been justified only by a showing of prior discrimination in the hiring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification , " Powell said . Insisting as well that any affirmative-action plan must be " narrowly tailored " to achieve its ends , he went on to signal an inclination to reject race-based firing schemes for being too harsh on the innocent , but to look more favorably upon some hiring plans . A brief separate concurrence by Justice Byron White also stressed an aversion to layoff plans . <P> The four dissenters were satisfied that the district 's actions were constitutionally acceptable . And while the majority was not prepared to go this far , the Justices across the board seemed plainly supportive of some race-based solutions . Powell wrote that " in order to remedy the effects of prior discrimination , it may be necessary to take race into account . " That could mean , he added , that " innocent persons may be called upon to bear some of the burden of the remedy . "                    @
