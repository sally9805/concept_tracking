From a hearing in New York City in March on the issue of whether to relocate Richard Serra 's Tilted Arc , a sculpture commissioned by the federal government for the plaza of the Jacob Javirs Federal Building in lower Manhattan . The hearing was convened by William Diamond , regiana/ administrator of the General Services Administration , in response to the demand by many of the people who work in the building that the sculpture be removed . In April , Diamond recommended that Tilted Arc be relocated . A final decision by the GSA is pending . The testimony below has been edited for space . REPRESENTATIVE TED WEISS : Imagine , if you will , this curved slab of welded steel twelve feet high , 120 feet long , and weighing over seventy-three tons bisecting the street in front of your house , and you can imagine the reaction to Tilted Arc of those who live and work in the area . Adding to the shock effect is the sculpture 's natural oxide coating , which gives it the appearance of a rusted metal wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abandoned piece of construction material , a relic perhaps too large and cumbersome to move . The artist is said to have intended with this piece to " alter and dislocate the decorative function of the plaza . " If that was the intent , one may conclude from the sculpture 's harsh , disorienting effect that the artist has eloquently succeeded . But what of those who live and work nearby ! The sculpture cuts a huge swath across the center of the plaza , dividing it in two and acting as a barrier to the building 's main doorways . Access to the building is awkward and confusing , and the normal walking patterns of those who enter and exit the building are disrupted . The time has come to find a new location for Tilted Arc . Mr. Serra argues that because his work is site specific , moving it to another location would destroy it . It has , he maintains , a proprietary claim upon the plaza just as real as that of a painting to its canvas . I suggest that there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and that the scales tip in their favor . The community ? those thousands of people who live and work in the area ? has the right to reclaim this small oasis for the respite and relaxation for which it was intended . Mr. Serra , 1 do nor wish to see your work destroyed . I simply would like to see it in a more felicitous location . RICHARD SERRA : My name is Richard Serra and I am an American sculptor . I do n't make portable objects . I do n't make works that can be relocated or site adjusted . I make works that deal with the environmental components of given places . The scale , size , and location of my site-specific works are determined by the topography of the site , whether it be urban , landscape , or an architectural enclosure . My works become part of and are built into the structure of the site , and they often restructure , both conceptually and perceptually , the organization of the site . My sculptures are not objects for the viewer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture on a pedestal was to establish a separation between the sculpture and the viewer . I am interested in creating a behavioral space in which the viewer interacts with the sculpture in its context . One 's identity as a person is closely connected with one 's experience of space and place . When a known space is changed through the inclusion of a site-specific sculpture , one is called upon to relate to the space differently . This is a condition that can be engendered only by sculpture . This experience of space may startle some people . When the government invited me to propose a sculpture for the plaza it asked for a permanent , site-specific sculpture . As the phrase implies , a site-specific sculpture is one that is conceived and created in relation to the particular conditions of a specific sire , and only to those conditions . To remove Tilted Arc , therefore , would be to destroy it . The final decision to install Tilted Arc was based upon the GSA 's full knowledge of the sculpture , and the agency made an explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been suggested that the public did not choose to install the work in the first place . In fact , the choice of the artist and the decision to install the sculpture permanently in the plaza were made by a public entity : the GSA . Its determination was made on the basis of national standards and carefully formulated procedures , and a jury system ensured impartiality and the selection of art of lasting value . The selection of this sculpture was , therefore , made by , and on behalf of , the public . The agency made its commitments and signed a contract . if its decision is reversed in response to pressure from outside sources , the integrity of governmental programs related to the arts will be compromised , and artists of integrity will not participate . If the government can destroy works of art when confronted with such pressure , its capacity to foster artistic diversity and its power to safeguard freedom of creative expression will be in jeopardy . JUDGE DOMINICK DICARLO : I had my first encounter with Tilted Arc after learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Court of International Trade . I was driving on Centre Street when I saw it . What is it ? It 's a 120-foot-by-twelve-foot rusted piece of iron . Having just returned from visiting our embassies in Rome , Islamabad , Rangoon , and Bangkok , I concluded that this rusted iron object was an anti-terrorist barricade , part of a crash program to protect United States government buildings against terrorist activities . But why such a huge barricade ? Was this an overreaction ? Why in cities where terrorist activity is much greater are comparatively attractive highway dividers and concrete pillars sufficient to do the job ? After my appointment to the court , I was told that this was art . Was it a thing of beauty ? Could be , since beauty is in the eyes of the beholder . Could its maker be making a political statement ? Perhaps it was a discarded and rusted piece of the iron curtain . Or perhaps its author was expressing his views on trade policy . This is the Court of International Trade . Was his iron barrier symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess why the iron wall was placed in the plaza . Those responsible have told us . It was to alter and dislocate the decorative function of the plaza , to redefine the space , to change the viewers ' experience of that plaza . Simply put , their intention was to destroy the plaza 's original artistic concept , the concept of its architects . To object to the removal of the iron wall on the basis of an honest , moral right to preserve the integrity of the work is astounding , since the sculptor 's intent was to destroy another artistic creation . This may top the usual example of chutzpa : the person who kills his mother and father and then asks for mercy on the grounds that he is an orphan . PETER HIRSCH : I am the research director and legal counsel for the Association of Immigration Attorneys , We are constantly at 26 Federal Plaza , since that is where the Immigration Service is located . My membership has authorized me to say that we are entirely opposed to Tilted Arc . My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arc would he in the Hudson River . That is not a facetious comment . Westway is about to he built , and I am told that they are going to have to put artificial things in the river to provide shelter for the striped bass . I think Tilted Arc would make a very fine shelter . FRED HOFFMAN : 1 am an art historian and curator of contemporary art associated with many of the leading cultural organizations in Los Angeles . We can learn more about ourselves , about the nature of our social relations , and about the nature of the spaces we inhabit and depend upon by keeping Tilted Arc than we ever could by languishing in the alleged pleasures of a Serra-less plaza . One of the fundamental realities about an important work of art such as Tilted Arc is that it does not simply sit down , roll over , and play dead . This work does not have as its intention pleasing , entertaining , or pacifying . By structuring an experience that is continually active , dynamic , and expansive , Tilted Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indifferent to our destiny and to the increasing scarcity of freedom in an increasingly banal , undifferentiated , and style-oriented world . VICKLE UDOUGHERTY : I am a physical security specialist for the Federal Protection and Safety Division of the GSA . My main purpose here is to present the security angle , which affects us in the execution of our duties . 1 consider Tilted Arc to be a security hazard , or disadvantage . My main contention is that it presents a blast wall effect . It 's 120 feet long , twelve feet high , and angled toward two federal buildings . The front curvature of the design is such that it could vent an explosion both upward and at an angle toward both buildings . In the past , there have been several terrorist explosions on federal property . Many times a wall or something like it was used to vent the explosion against the building . Another problem is graffiti . That wail ? pardon , Tilted Arc ? is used more for graffiti purposes than any of the other walls . And most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see the graffiti artists at work . Basically , we feel that if Tilted Arc stays , we can adapt . But if there was an explosion on our side of the sculpture , there would be a great deal of property damage m the form of shattering glass . if it happened during the day , this could mean loss of life . WILLIAM RUBIN : I am director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum Of Modern Art . Like many creations of modem art , Tilted Arc is a challenging work that obliges is to question received values in general and the nature of art and of art 's relation rn the public in particular . About one hundred years ago the Impressionists and post-Impressionists ( Monet , Gauguin , Cezanne , for example ) . artists whose works are today prized universally , were being reviled as ridiculous by the public and the established press . At about the same time , the Eiffel Tower was constructed , only to be greeted by much the same ridicule . Leading architects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the man on the street , condemned the tower as a visual obscenity . As these examples suggest , truly challenging works of art require a period of time before their artistic language can be understood by the broader public . I must say that I have never heard of a decision to remove a public monument being settled by popular vote . If that is what is being contemplated here , it seems to me a most dangerous precedent . Moreover , the decision should , it seems to me , involve the sentiments of a much wider circle than simply those who work in the immediate neighborhood . For society as a whole has a stake in such works of art . Certainly the consideration of any such move should not be a response to pressure tactics and , above all , should not take place before the sculpture 's artistic language can become familiar . I therefore propose that consideration of this issue be deferred for at least ten years . JOEL KOVEL : 1 am a writer and a professor at the New School for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence the value , of Tilted Arc . Its very tilt and rust remind us that the gleaming and heartless steel and glass structures of the stare apparatus can one day pass away . It therefore creates an unconscious sense of opposition and hope . This opposition is itself a creative act , as , indeed , this hearing is a creative act . I would submit that the true measure ' of a free and democratic society is that it permits opposition of this sort . Therefore , it is essential that this hearing result in the preservation of Serra 's work as a measure of the opposition this society can tolerate . JOSEPH LIEBMAN : I am the attorney in charge of the International Trade Field Office , Civil Division , U.S. Department of Justice , with offices located at 26 Federal Plaza . I have worked at 26 Federal Plaza since 1969 . While the plaza never fulfilled all my expectations , until 1980 I regarded it as a relaxing space where I could walk , sit , and contemplate in an unhurried manner . Every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new vistas and moods for its vibrant , unchallenged space . I remember those moments . I remember the cool spray of the fountain misting the hot air . I remember the band concerts . I remember the musical sounds of neighborhood children playing on the plaza while their mothers rocked baby carriages . I remember walking freely in the plaza , contemplating the examination of a witness , undisturbed by the presence of other people engaged in conversation or young lovers holding hands . I also remember my dreams of additional seating areas , more cultural events , temporary outdoor exhibits of painting and sculpture , and ethnic dance festivals , All of those things are just memories now . Regardless of the thoughtfulness and artistic accomplishment of its creator , Tilted Arc fails to add significant value to the plaza . The arc has condemned us to lead emptier lives . The children , the bands , and I no longer visit the plaza . Instead , the arc divides space against itself . Whatever artistic value the arc may have does not justify the disruption of the plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal hand , should yield . Relocate it in another land . Reprieve us from our desolate condemnation . DOUGLAS CRIMP : I am a critic and the managing editor of the cultural journal October . I want to speak here not as a professional , however , but as a member of the public . What makes me feel manipulated here today is that I am being forced to argue for art as against some other social function . I am asked to line up on the side of sculpture and against those who are on the side of , say , concerts , or maybe picnic tables . But of course all of these things have social functions . It is a measure of the meager nature of our public social life that we are asked , in a travesty of democratic procedure , to fight it out over the crumbs of social experience . I believe that we have been polarized here so that we do not notice the real issue : the fact that our social experience is deliberately and drastically limited by our public officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , the public , can be discerned from a passage in a letter written by Chief Judge Edward Re , who has been leading the fight to remove Tilted Arc since the day it was erected , After a long list of complaints against Tilted Arc ( including the absolutely surreal claim that it causes rat problems ) Judge Re writes , and I quote , " Finally , but by no means of minor importance , is the loss of efficient security surveillance . The placement of this wall across the plaza obscures the view of security personnel , who have no way of knowing what is taking place on the other side of the wall . " Well , I would submit that it is we , the public , who are on the other side of this wall , and that it is we who Judge Re so fears and despises that he wants that wall torn down in order that we may be properly subjected to surveillance . It is no small measure of the success of Tilted Arc that it has elicited this repugnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm . I urge that this wall be kept in place and that we construct our social lives in relation to it : that is out of sight of those who would conceive of social life as something to be feared , despised , and surveyed . DONALD jUDD : We need to revive a secular version of sacrilege to categorize the attempt to destroy Richard Serra 's work in Federal Plaza in Manhattan . Art is not to be destroyed , either old or new . It is visible civilization . Those who want to ruin Serra 's work are barbarians . MICHAEL HALL : I am head of the sculpture department at the Cranbrook Academy of Art , Detroit . Perhaps the public agencies that generate and institute public art projects have failed to execute their mandate completely . In a simple analogy , I would expect a public health agency to undertake a broad educational program in any community where it expected to begin mass immunization programs . People rarely submit to injections of vaccine without some idea of why a needle is being pushed into their skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , pricks our emotional and intellectual skin . The vaccine is not ineffective just because the injection is uncomfortable . This is not simply to assert that because it tastes bad , it 's good for you . On the other hand , appetites are cultivated , and the arc is a part of a banquet that is being served up for our pleasure and out nutrition . An agency and an idea may well have failed here , rather than an artist and a sculpture . HOLLY SOLOMON : I had a gallery in SoHo and now I 've moved to Fifty-seventh Street . I do n't feel qualified to discuss the law part of this and I do n't feel I have time to discuss the taste or the art historical importance of this piece . I can only tell you , gentlemen , that this is business , and to rake down the piece is bad business . Mr. Serra is one of the leading sculptors of our time . I sell many paintings . I try very hard to teach people about contemporary art , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you really have to understand that you have a responsibility to the financial community . You can not destroy property . PHIL LA BASI : I have been a federal employee for twenty-two years , about eleven years in this building . First of all , I would like to say that I really resent the implication that those of us who oppose this structure are cretins or some sort of reactionaries . It seems to be very typical of self-serving artists and so-called pseudo intellectuals that when they disagree with something someone else has to say , they attack the person . So I am not going to attack the artist . What I see there is something that looks like a tank trap to prevent an armed attack from Chinatown in case of a Soviet invasion . In my mind it probably would n't even do that well , because one good Russian tank could probably take it out . To be very serious , I would n't call it Tilted Arc . To me it looks like crooked metal or bent metal . I think we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think any one of these people here could come along with an old broken bicycle that perhaps got run over by a car , or some other piece of material , and pull it up and call it art and name it something . I think that was what was done here . The poor federal employees , us cretins , us reactionaries , us poor slobs that work at 26 Federal Plaza , are given a had name because we are not intellectual and we do n't appreciate art . Well , many of us have art in our homes and many of us appreciate it , but that thing our there ? by no stretch of the imagination , so help me God ? I could not call that art if you paid me to call it art . SHIRLEY PARIS : 1 an here as a private citizen , although I work in the area . Tilted Arc is in my opinion the Berlin Wall of Foley Square , and like its prototype , it should have been knocked down during construction . This gigantic strip of rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the civil servants who serve the government , and at those of us who make up much of the regular daytime population of Foley Square . It is bad enough for the government and its civil servants to he the perennial targets of the public and the press alike , but for us to be denigrated by artists as well is , to say the least , to compound the insult . It should be noted that many of the people who visit this building are going to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to apply for citizenship . They are eager to become citizens of our great nation and leave behind their original , and often oppressive , homelands . Yet as they enter the building from which they hope to emerge with the promise of a brighter future , they are compelled to circumvent this rusty reminder of totalitarianism . FRANK STELLA : In the matter under discussion here the government and the artist , Richard Serra , have acted in good faith and have executed their responsibilities in exemplary fashion . The objections to their efforts are without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and idiosyncratic . The government and the artist have acted as the body of society attempting to meet civilized , one might almost say civilizing , goals ? in this case , the extension of visual culture into public spaces . The attempt to reverse their efforts serves no broad social purpose and is contrary to the honest , searching efforts that represent the larger and truer goals of society . Satisfaction for the dissenters is not a necessity . The continued cultural aspirations of the society are a necessity , as is the protection of these aspirations . The dissenters have accomplished enough by having their objections heard , discussed , and publicized . Whatever merit their case may have , it is now parr of the public record and will have its proper influence in future decisions involving matters of this kind . To destroy the work of art and simultaneously incur greater public expense in that effort would disturb the status quo for no gain . Furthermore , the precedent set can only have wasteful and unnecessary consequences . There is no reason to encourage harassment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There arc no circumstances here to warrant further administrative or judicial action . If the matter stands as it is , no one will experience any serious harm or duress and one more work of art will be preserved . This dispute should not be allowed to disrupt a successful working relationship between government agencies and citizen artists . Finally , no public dispute should force the gratuitous destruction of any benign , civilizing effort . DANNY KATZ : My name is Danny Katz and I work in this building as a clerk . My friend Vito told me this morning that I am a philistine . Despite that , I am getting up to speak . Listen fast , because I hear seconds being counted and tempers are high . The blame falls on everyone involved in this project from the beginning for forgetting the human element . I do n't think this issue should be elevated into a dispute between the forces of ignorance and art , or art versus government . I really blame government less because it has long ago outgrown its human dimension . But from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expect to hear them rely on the tired and dangerous reasoning that the government has made a deal , so let the rabble live with the steel because it 's a deal . That kind of mentality leads to wars . We had a deal with Vietnam . I did n't expect to hear the arrogant position that art justifies interference with the simple joys of human activity in a plaza . it 's not a great plaza by international standards , but it is a smallrefuge and place of revival for people who ride to work in steel containers , work in sealed rooms , and breathe recirculated air all clay . Is the purpose of art in public places to seal off a route of escape , to stress the absence of joy and hope ? I ca n't believe that this was the artistic intention , yet to my sadness this for me has been the dominant effect of the work , and it 's all the fault of its position and location . I can accept anything in art , but I ca n't accept physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of art created with a contempt for ordinary humanity and without respect for the common element of human experience can be great . It will always lack a dimension . I do n't believe the contempt is in the work . The work is strong enough to stand alone in a better place . I would suggest to Mr. Serra that he take advantage of this opportunity to walk away from this fiasco and demand that the work be moved to a place where it will better reveal its beauty .
