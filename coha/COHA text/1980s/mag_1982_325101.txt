THE MAN FROM ST . PETERSBURG by Ken Follett Morrow ; 323 pages ; $14.50 <P> In the glorious spring of 1914 , not all is dew-pearled . What with taxes , trade unions , the Irish and the suffragettes , England is going to the dogs . In Russia the throne is tottering and workers are out in the streets demanding democracy . In Germany , the Kaiser 's men are oiling the guns of August . The Allies attempt to persuade Russia to engage the Boche on the eastern front . But the Bear hangs tough , and time is short . <P> This scenario is shrewdly amplified by an expert in the art of ransacking history for thrills . British Novelist Ken Follett , 32 , rewrote World War II in The Eye of the Needle and reinterpreted Middle East tensions in Triple . In The Man from St. Petersburg , he recalls Russia and England during the days just before the Great War . As always , his plot is eerily plausible . <P> Though Prince Aleksey Andreyevich Orlov is only 30 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusts with a secret task : extracting a stiff price for Russian commitment . Orlov has other credentials : another uncle is the Earl of Walden , a father figure to young Orlov since the boy 's Oxford days . Together , the relatives negotiate the fate of their respective nations . It is not an easy matter . In Russia , revolutionaries are appalled at the prospect of war . Feliks Kschessinsky , a terrorist leader , fulminates , " Half the misery in the world is caused by nice young men like Orlov who think they have the right to organize wars between nations . " <P> Feliks , the son of a poor country priest elects to assassinate Prince Orlov . The " anarchist chappie , " as he is called , moves close to his prey by captivating the susceptible Lady Charlotte , the earl 's young daughter . Follett makes good use of a taut if predictable double subplot to forward Feliks ' machinations and throw Cabinets , kings and boudoirs into turmoil . The denouement , in which all the major characters and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Anglo-Russian pact , is one of Follett 's finest , with a staccato performance by the deceptively cherubic young Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty . Winston 's connivance is echoed in a scene at 10 Downing Street , in which Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and his advisers pass " the Balkans around like a box of chocolates , help yourself , choose your favorite flavor . " Even with anarchist chap pies on the loose , life was a whole lot simpler in those days . <P> - By Michael Demarest
