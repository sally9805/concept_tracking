An Indiana convict has become a top jailhouse lawyer <P> As a youngster , Richard Lee Owen II loved to curl up with the discarded lawbooks he obtained when his grandfather took him along on a visit to the county courthouse . By the time he was 13 , however , Owen was on the wrong side of the law , serving time at an Indiana reform school for stealing from purses during a church choir rehearsal . That was the start of a life of crime , including a bank robbery and an attempted murder , that has kept him in prison for 19 of his 35 years . But now Owen has rediscovered an old friend-the lawbook-and has become one of the nation 's most accomplished self-taught lawyers behind bars . <P> Lined with books and cans of Campbell 's soup , Owen 's narrow cell in the maximum security prison in Michigan City , Ind. , is the nerve center of a remarkable legal operation that runs almost nonstop . On a typical weekday , Owen rises at 7:30 and skips breakfast in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners . After lunch , he does research until 3 , when he is available in his cell for consultation with inmate clients . Long evenings are devoted to more research and legal reading , aided by a Rolodex that lists 22,000 criminal cases . <P> Owen 's single-minded devotion pays real dividends : $9,000 in annual income from attorneys who use him to do research . ( He invests the money primarily in his personal 3,000-volume library . ) Charging $7.50 an hour , Owen easily undercuts the $22 to $25 fees asked by law students and young lawyers , who are often hired for such chores . Yet Owen 's output is anything but cut-rate . Indianapolis Lawyer J. Richard Kiefer calls the convict 's research " incredibly good . ' ' Once Kiefer gave the same project to Owen and several law students ; Owen was the first to uncover the three precedents that Kiefer needed . Says John Gubbins , senior staff attorney for the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago : " In the area of habeas corpus and prisoners ' civil rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Owen occasionally has been allowed , at the judges ' discretion , to appear in court on behalf of his prisoner clients . He usually shows up wearing handcuffs and a yellow leisure suit , his papers in a briefcase made by a fellow convict . In 1978 , he won freedom for Elisar Yzaguirre , who was serving a life sentence for kidnaping , when he persuaded the judge to downgrade his client 's offense to unlawful confinement . Such victories have helped Owen compile a record that many an appellate attorney would envy : in 25% of his cases , the clients have won at least some relief . <P> Although he can still appear in federal courts , Owen is no longer allowed to take part in state proceedings . A year ago , Indiana 's chief justice concluded that since Owen is not a member of the bar ( he has only a junior college degree , earned in prison ) , he could not represent others . Nevertheless , he is free to write briefs for fellow prisoners , which can be polished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reversal of a murder conviction for Isadore Serrano . He argued that the case had posed a conflict of interest because Serrano 's trial lawyer was also the attorney for a prosecution witness .
