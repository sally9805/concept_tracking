 | " And you did n't see him when you regained consciousness after the events at the bridge ? " " No , I did n't . " " You do n't know where he went ? " " No , sir . " " Neither does Rome , " added the undersecretary quietly , pointedly . " I learned that an Italian soldier was hit by a truck and was pretty badly mangled , screaming his head off . Someone said he had blond hair , so I figured it was Ricci . " " And ? " " A man came out of the woods  --  someone with a gash in his head ? put the soldier in a car , and drove him away . " " How did you learn this ? " " I asked questions , a lot of questions . . . after I got first aid . That was my job , sir . It was a madhouse up there , Italians and French yelling all over the place . But I did n't leave until I found out everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're to be commended , " said the ambassador . " Thank you , sir . " " Let 's assume you 're right . " Bradford leaned forward . " The blond man was Ricci , and someone with a head wound got him out of there . Have you any idea who that someone might be ? " " I think so . One of the men he brought with him . The other was killed . " " So Ricci and this other man got away . But Rome has n't heard from Ricci . Would you say that 's normal ? " " No way , sir . It 's not normal at all . Whenever any of those people are damaged , they bleed us for everything they can get , and they do n't waste time about it . Our policy in black operations is clear . If we ca n't evacuate the wounded ? " " I think we understand , " interrupted Halyard , an old soldier 's antennae picking up a signal couched in a soldier 's vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this demolitions expert got away intact , they 'd have reached our embassy in Rome as quickly as they could . " " Yes , sir . With their hands out and shouting all the way . They would have expected attention pronto and threatened us with the kind we do n't want if they did n't get it . " " What do you think happened ? "  | " I 'd say it 's pretty obvious . They did n't make it . " " What was that ? " asked Brooks . " There is n't any other explanation . I know those people , sir . They 're , garbage ; they 'd kill their mothers if the price was right . They would have been in touch with Rome , believe me . " " Did n't make it ' ? " repeated Halyard , staring at the man from Col des Moulinets . " What do you mean ? " " The roads , sir . They wind up and down those mountains like corkscrews , sometimes without lights for miles at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and screaming ; that vehicle 's a candidate for a long fall up there . " " Head wounds can be deceptive , " Halyard commented . " A bloody nose looks a hell of a lot worse than it is . " " It strikes me , " said Brooks , " that same man acted with considerable presence of mind amid the chaos . He functioned ? " " Forgive me , Mr. Ambassador , " interrupted Bradford , his voice rising slightly but deferentially . The intrusion was not a breach of manners but a signal . " I think the field officer 's point is well taken . A thorough search of those roads will undoubtedly reveal a car somewhere at the bottom of a precipice . " Brooks exchanged looks with the man from State ; the signal was acknowledged . " Yes , of course . Realistically , there is no other explanation . " " Just one or two more points and we 're finished , " said Bradford , rearranging his papers . " As you know , whatever is said here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording devices ; the words spoken here are stored only in our memories . This is for the protection of all of us  --  not just you  --  so feel perfectly free to speak candidly . Do n't try to soften the truth ; we 're in the same boat . " " I understand , sir . " " Your orders with regard to Havelock were unequivocal . He was officially classified beyond salvage ' and the word from Rome was to terminate with extreme prejudice . ' Is that correct ? " " Yes , sir . " " In other words , he was to be executed . Killed at Col des Moulinets . " " That 's what it meant . " " And you received those instructions from the senior attache , Consular Operations , Rome . A man named Warren . Harry Warren . " " Yes , sir . I was in constant touch with him , waiting for the determination . . . waiting for Washington to give it to him . "  | " How could you be certain the man you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexed , as if the question were foolish , though the man who asked it was not foolish at all . " Among other things , I worked with Harry for over two years . I knew his voice . " " Just his voice ? " " And the number in Rome . It was a direct line to the embassy 's radio room , unlisted and very classified . I knew that , too . " " Did it occur to you that when he gave you your final instructions he might have been doing so under duress ? Against his will ? " " No , sir , not at all . " " It never crossed your mind ? " " If that had been the case , he would have told me . " " With a gun at his head ? " said Halyard . " How ? " " The code had been established and he used it . He would n't have if there 'd been anything wrong . " " Explain that , please , " said Brooks . " What code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that originate in Washington . They 're referred to when decisions are transmitted ; that way you know the authorization 's there without naming names . If anything had been wrong , Harry would n't have used the code , and I would have known something was n't right . I 'd have asked for it and he would have given me a different one . He did n't and I did n't . He used the correct one up front . " " What was the code for Col des Moulinets ? " asked Emory Bradford . " Ambiguity , sir . It came direct from Cons Op , Washington , and will be listed in the embassy telephone logs , classified files . " " Which is proof of authorization , " said Bradford , making a statement . " Yes , sir . Dates , times and origins of clearance are in those logs . " Bradford held up an eight-by-ten-inch photograph of a man 's face , adjusting the Tensor lamp so it could be seen clearly . " Is this Harry Warren ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " The undersecretary put down the photograph and made a check mark on the border of his notes . " Let me go back a bit ; there 's something I 'm not sure is clear . Regarding the woman , she was to be sent across the border unharmed , if possible . Is that correct ? " " The operative words were if possible . ' Nobody was going to risk anything for her . She was just a needle . " " A needle ? "  | " To stick into the Soviets . Let Moscow know we did n't buy the plant . " " Meaning she was a Russian device . A woman similar in appearance ? perhaps someone who had undergone cosmetic surgery  --  whom the Soviets surfaced repeatedly at selected locations for Havelock 's benefit , letting him get close , but never close enough to take her . Is that what you mean ? " " Yes , sir . " " The purpose being to shock Havelock into a state of mental instability , to the point of defection ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess it worked ; the ' beyond salvage ' came from Washington . " " From Ambiguity . " " Ambiguity , sir . " " Whose identity can be traced in the embassy 's telephone logs . " " Yes , sir . The logs . " " So it was established beyond doubt that the woman at the bridge was not Jenna Karas. , ' " Beyond doubt . She was killed at Costa Brava , everyone knew that . Havelock himself was the agent of record at that beach . He went crazy . " Ambassador Brooks slapped down his pencil and leaned forward , studying the man from Col des Moulinets . The sharp , echoing crack of the pencil , and the movement itself , were more than an interruption ; they combined to indicate an objection . " This entire operation , did n't it strike you as . . . well , bizarre , to say the least ? To be quite candid , was execution the only solution ? Knowing what you all knew  --  presumed you knew ? could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , get him back here for treatment ? " " With respect , sir , that 's a lot easier said than done . Jack Ogilvie tried in Rome and never left the Palatine . Havelock killed three men on that bridge that we know of ; another two may be dead by now and probably are . He dug a knife into my face ? He 's a psycho . " The agent paused , not finished . " Yes , sir . All things considered , we kill him . That 's ' beyond salvage , ' and has nothing to do with me . I follow orders . " " An all too familiar phrase , sir , " said Brooks . " But justified under the circumstances , " Bradford broke in quickly , writing out the word Ambiguity on the page in front of him and continuing before anyone else could speak , or object . " What happened to Havelock ? Did you learn ? " ' They said an assassino pazzo  --  crazy man , killer  --  drove the truck  | hellbent across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Havelock . There are alerts out all through the provinces  --  the towns and cities and up and down the Mediterranean coast . He worked the coast ; he 'll get in touch with someone and they 'll find him . They said he was wounded ; he wo n't get far . My guess is a couple of days at the outside , and I wish I was there to take him myself . " " Again quite justified , " said Bradford , " And we want to thank you for your cooperation this evening . You 've been very concise and helpful . You may leave now , and good luck to you . " The man got out of the chair , nodded awkwardly and walked to the door . He stopped , touching his left cheek and the tape as he turned to face the powerful men on the dais . " I 'm worth the surgery , " he said . " I 'm sure you are , " replied the undersecretary . The agent of record from Col des Moulinets opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was shut , Halyard turned to Bradford and shouted , " Get hold of Rome ! Get those logs and find this Ambiguity ! It 's what you were trying to tell us , is n't it ? This is the link to Parsifal ! " " Yes , General , " answered Bradford . " The Ambiguity code was established by the director of Consular Operations , Daniel Stern , whose name appears in the embassy logs , entered by the Cons Op senior attache , Harry Warren . Warren was clear in his entry ; the transcript was read to me . He wrote the following " ? the undersecretary picked up a note on top of his papers ? " Code : Ambiguity . Subject : M. Havelock . Decision pending . ' " " Pending ' ? " asked Brooks . " When was it made ? " " According to the embassy logs , it was n't . There were no further entries that night making any reference whatsoever to Ambiguity , Havelock , or the unit at Col des Moulinets . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man . The goahead was given , the authorization code was delivered . He did n't mince words . That call had to have come through . " " It did . " " Are you saying that the entry was deleted ? " asked Brooks . " It was never made , " said Bradford . " Warren never made it . " " Then get him , " said Halyard . " Nail him . He knows who he talked to . Goddamn it , Emory , get on that phone . This is Parsifal ! " He turned in his chair , addressing the wall . " Mr. President ? " There was no reply . The undersecretary separated the papers in front of him and removed  | a thin manila envelope from the rest . He opened it , took out a second photograph and handed it to the former ambassador . Brooks studied it , a sharp intake of breath accompanying his first glance . Silently he passed it to Halyard . " Jesus ... " Halyard placed the photograph under the beam of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a transmitting machine , but the image was clear . It was a photograph of a corpse stretched out on a white table , the clothes torn and bloody , the face bruised terribly but wiped clean for identification . The face of the dead man was the same as that in the first photograph Bradford had shown the agent from Col des Moulinets only minutes before . It belonged to Harry Warren , senior attache , Cons Op , Rome . " That was telexed to us at one o'clock this afternoon . It 's Warren . He was run down on the Via Frascatti in the early hours of the morning two days ago . There were witnesses , but they could n't help much , except to tell our people the car was a large sedan with a powerful engine ; it roared down the street , apparently gathering speed just before impact . Whoever drove it was n't taking any chances of missing ; he caught Warren stepping onto the curb and hammered him into the pole of a streetlight , doing considerable damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's not much hope . It 's probably at the bottom of a river in the hills . " " So the link is gone . " Halyard pushed the photograph toward Brooks . " I mourn the man , " said the undersecretary , " but I 'm not sure how much of a link he was . " " Someone thought so , " said the soldier . " Or was covering a flank . " " What do you mean ? " asked Brooks . " Whoever made that final call authorizing beyond salvage ' could n't know what Stern told Warren . All we know is that the decision had n't been made . " " Please be clearer , " the statesman insisted . " Suppose the strategists of Consular Operations decided they could n't reach a decision . On the surface , it would n't appear that difficult  --  a psychopath , a rogue agent capable of causing extraordinary damage , a potential defector , a killer  --  the decision was n't one that stretched their consciences . But suppose they learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " ' The Karas woman , " said Halyard.  | " Perhaps . Or maybe a communication , or a signal from Havelock that contradicted the assumption that he was a maniac . That he was as sane as they were ; a sane man caught in a terrible dilemma not of his own making . " " Which is , of course , the truth , " interrupted Brooks quietly . " The truth , " agreed Bradford . " What would they do ? " " Get help , " said Halyard . " Advice . " " Guidance , " added the statesman . " Or practically speaking , " said the undersecretary , " especially if the facts were n't clear , they 'd spread the responsibility for the decision . Hours later it was made , and they were dead . . . and we do n't know who made it , who placed that final call . We only know it was someone sufficiently cleared , sufficiently trusted to be given the code Ambiguity . That man made the decision ; he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't log it , " said Brooks . " Why did n't he ? How could it happen ? " " The way it 's happened before , Mr. Ambassador . A routed line traceable only to a single telephone complex somewhere in Arlington is used , the authorization verified by code , and a request made on the basis of internal security : There is to be no log , no tape , no reference to the transmission ; it 's an order , actually . The recipient is flattered ; he 's been chosen , deemed by men who make important decisions to be more reliable than those around him . And what difference does it make ? The authorization can always be traced through the code  --  in this case through the director of Cons Op , Daniel Stern . Only , he 's dead . " " It 's appalling , " said Brooks , looking down at his notes . man is to be executed because he 's right , and when the attempt fails , he 's held responsible for the death of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we do n't know who officially gave the order . We ca n't find him . What kind of people are we ? " " Men who keep secrets . " The voice came from behind the dais . The President of the United States emerged from the white-paneled door set into the white wall . " Forgive me , I was watching you , listening . It 's often helpful . " " Secrets , Mr. President ? " " Yes , Mal , " said Berquist , going to his chair . " The words are all there , are n't they ? Top Secret , Eyes Only , Highly Classified , Maximum Clearance Required , Duplication Forbidden , Authorization to Be Accompanied by Access Code . . . so many words . We sweep rooms and  | telephone lines with instruments that tell us whether bugs and intercepts have been placed , and then develop hardware that misdirects those same scanners when we implant our own devices . We jam radio broadcasts ? including satellite transmissions  --  and override the jamming with laser beams that carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security lid on information we do n't want made public so we can leak selected sections at will , keeping the rest inviolate . We tell a certain agency or department one thing and another something else entirely , so as to conceal a third set of facts  --  the damaging truth . In history 's most advanced age of communications , we 're doing our damnedest to louse it up , to misuse it , really . " The President sat down , looked at the photograph of the dead man in Rome , and turned it over . " Keeping secrets and diverting the flow of accurate information have become prime objectives in our ever-expanding technology  --  of communications . Ironic , is n't it ? " " Unfortunately , often vital , sir , " said Bradford . " Perhaps . If only we could be certain when we applied them . I often wonder  --  late at night , watching the lights on the ceiling as I 'm trying to sleep  --  if we had n't tried to keep a secret three months ago , whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Our options were extremely limited , Mr. President , " the undersecretary said firmly . " We might have faced worse . " " Worse , Emory ? " " Earlier , then . Time is the only thing on our side . " " And we have to use every goddamn minute , " agreed Berquist , glancing first at the general and then at Brooks . " Now you 're both aware of what 's happened during the past seventy-two hours and why I had to call you back to Washington . " " Except the most relevant factor , " said the statesman . " Parsifal 's reaction . " " None , " replied the President . " Then he does n't know , " said Halyard rapidly , emphatically . " If you 'd get that written in stone , I could sleep at night , " said Berquist . " When did he last communicate with you ? " asked Brooks . " Sixteen days ago . There was no point in reaching you ; it was another demand , as outrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's been no movement on the previous demands ? " continued the statesman . " Nothing . As of fifteen days ago we 've funneled eight hundred million dollars into banks throughout the Bahamas , the Caymans and Central  | America . We 've set up every ? " The President paused as he touched the photograph in front of him , folding a corner until part of a bloodied trouser leg could be seen . " ? every code and countercode he 's asked for , so he could verify the deposits whenever he wished , have the monies sent to blind accounts in Zurich and Bern where they would be accessible to him . He has n't moved a cent , and except for three verifications he 's made no contact at all with the other banks . He has no interest in the money ; it 's only a means of confirming our vulnerability . He knows we 'll do anything he asks . " Berquist paused again ; when he spoke , his voice was barely audible . " God help us , we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dais , an acknowledgment of the unthinkable . It was broken by the general 's businesslike comment . " There are a couple of holes here , " he said , reading his notes , then looking at the undersecretary . " Can you fill them in ? " " I can speculate , " replied Bradford . " But to do even that , we 've got to go back to the very beginning . Before Rome . " " Costa Brava ? " asked Brooks disdainfully . " Before then , Mr. Ambassador . To when we all agreed there had to be a Costa Brava . " " I stand rebuked , " said the statesman icily . " Please go on . " " We go back to when we learned that it was Matthias himself who initiated the investigation of Jenna Karas . It was the great man himself , not his aides , who relayed information from unnamed informants , sources so deep in Soviet intelligence that even to speculate on their identities was tantamount to exposing our own operations . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We did n't learn that it was Matthias . You did . You had the perspicacity to go around the great man , ' as you call him . " " Only with a sense of sadness , sir . It was you , Mr. President , who demanded the truth from one of his aides in the Oval Office and he gave it to you . He said they did n't know where the information had come from , only that Matthias himself had brought it in . He never would have told me that . " " The room did it , I did n't , " said Berquist . " You do n't lie to the man sitting in that room . . . unless you 're Anthony Matthias . " " In fairness , Mr. President , " said Brooks softly , " his intention was not to deceive you . He believed he was right . " " He believed he should have been sitting in my chair , my office ! Good Christ , he still believes it . Even now ! There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emory. "  | " Yes , sir . " Bradford looked up . " We concluded that Matthias 's objective was to force Havelock to retire , to get his old student and one of the best men we had out of Consular Operations . We 've covered that before ; we did n't know why then and we do n't know why now . " " But we went along , " said Berquist , " because we did n't know what we had . A broken foreign service officer who did n't want to go on , or a fraud ? worse than a fraud . Matthias 's lackey , willing to see a woman killed so he could work for the great man on the outside . Oh , and the work he could have done ! The international emissary for Saint Matthias . Or was it Emperor Matthias , ruler of all the states and territories of the republic ? " " Come on , Charley . " Halyard touched the President 's arm ; no one else in that room would have risked such an intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we 're here . " " If it was n't for that son of a bitch Matthias we would n't be here ! I find that hard to forget . And so could the world one day . . . if there 's anyone left with a memory . " " Then may we return to that infinitely more ominous crisis , Mr. President ? " said Brooks gently . Berquist leaned back ; he looked at the aristocratic statesman , then at the old general . " When Bradford came to me and convinced me that there was a pattern of deception at the highest levels of State involving the great Anthony Matthias , I asked for you two  --  and only you two . At least , for now . I 'd better be able to take your criticism , because you 'll give it to me . " " Which I think is why you asked for us , " said Halyard . " Sir . " " You 're a ball-breaker , Mal . " The President nodded toward the man from State . " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we do n't know now , why Matthias wanted Havelock out . But Emory brought us the scenario . " An incredible scenario , " agreed Bradford , his hands on top of the papers , no longer needing his notes . " The case that Matthias concocted against the Karas woman was a study in meticulous invention . A reformed terrorist from Baader-Meinhof suddenly appears looking for absolution ; he 'll trade information for relocation and the cancellation of his death sentence . Bonn agrees  --  reluctantly  --  and we buy his story . The woman working with a Cons Op field officer then in Barcelona is actually a member of the KGB . A method of transferring orders is described , which entails the passing of a key , and a small overnight suitcase is located at an airport , her suitcase , filled with all the evidence needed to convict her ? detailed analyses of the activities she and Havelock had been involved  | with during the past five weeks , summaries of in-depth , classified information Havelock had sent back to the State Department , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . Also in that overnight bag were instructions from Moscow , including the KGB code that she was to employ should contact with KGB Northwest Sector be required . We tested the code and got a response ; it was authentic . " Brooks raised his left hand no more than a few inches above the surface of the dais , the gesture of a man used ' to commanding attention . " General Halyard and I are familiar with much of this , albeit not the specifics . I assume there 's a reason for your restating it in such detail . " " There is , Mr. Ambassador , " agreed Bradford . " It concerns Daniel Stern . Please bear with me . " " Then while you 're at it , " said the general , " how did you verify that KGB code ? " " By using the three basic maritime frequencies for that area of the Mediterranean . It 's standard procedure for the Soviets . " " That 's pretty damn simple of them , is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say it 's pretty damn smart . I 've studied the way we do it  --  I 've had to  --  and I 'm not sure ours is more effective . The frequencies we select are usually the weaker ones , not always clear , and easily jammed if discovered . You do n't tamper with maritime channels , and no matter how much traffic , the codes get through within a reasonable period of time . " " You 're very impressive , " said Brooks . " I 've had a series of crash courses during the past three months . Thanks to an executive order from the President , I 've also had the benefit of the best brains in the intelligence community . " " The reason for that executive order was not explained , " interrupted Berquist , glancing at the older men , then turning back to Bradford . " All right , you verified the KGB code to be authentic . " " It was the most incriminating document in that suitcase ; it could n't have been faked . So her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep wheels . " Bradford paused . " As you may or may not know , General  --  Mr. Ambassador  --  it was at this point that I came on the scene . I did n't seek to be included ; I was sought out by men I 'd worked with during the Johnson administration . . . and in Southeast Asia . " " Remnants of the benevolent AID in Vientiane who stayed with the Agency ? " asked Halyard sardonically .  | " Yes , " replied the undersecretary ; there was no apology in his answer . " Two men whose wide experience in undercover operations  --  favorable and unfavorable  --  led them to become what 's called source controls for informants deep within the Soviet apparatus . They phoned me at home one night , said they were at a local bar in Berwyn and why did n't I join them for a drink  --  old times ' sake . When I said it was late , the one I was talking to pointed out that it was also late for them , and Berwyn Heights was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood and joined them . " " I 've never heard this , " interrupted the former ambassador . " Am I to infer that these men did not report back through normal channels but , instead , went directly to you ? " " Yes , sir . They were disturbed . " " Thank God for the communion of past sinners , " said the President . " When they returned to those normal channels , they did it our way . It was beyond their scope , they reported . They pulled out and left it in Bradford 's lap . " " The information requested about the Karas woman was a basic intelligence query , " said Halyard . " Why were they disturbed ? " " Because it was a highly negative inquiry that presupposed the subject was too deep , too concealed for CIA detection . She was going to be found guilty no matter what the Agency came back with . " " Then it was the arrogance that angered them ? " suggested Brooks . " No , they 're used to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't possibly be true . They reached five separate sources in Moscow , none aware of the others  --  moles who had access to every black file in the KGB . Each probe came back negative . She was clean , but someone at State wanted her dirty . When one of the men routinely called an aide of Matthias to get further background from Cons Op , he was told simply to send back a nonproductive report  --  State had everything it needed . In other words , she was hanged no matter what the Agency returned , and the source control had the distinct impression that whatever was sent back to State would be buried . But Jenna Karas was no part of the KGB and never had been . " " How did your friends explain the KGB code ? " asked the soldier . " Someone in Moscow provided it , " said Bradford . " Someone working with or for Matthias . " Again the silence on the dais suggested the unthinkable , and once again it was broken by the general . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to revive it , " said Bradford quietly . " We 've explored the possibility to the point of exhaustion , " said Brooks , staring at Bradford . " Practically and conceptually , there 's no merit in the theory . Matthias is inexorably bound to Parsifal ; one does not exist without the other . If the Soviet Union had any knowledge of Parsifal , ten thousand multiple warheads would be in position to destroy half our cities and all our military installations . The Russians would have no choice but to launch , posing their final questions after the first strike . We have intelligence penetration to alert us to any such missile deployment ; there 's been no such alert . In your words , Mr. Bradford , time is the only thing on our side . " " I 'll stay with that judgment , Mr. Ambassador . Still , the KGB code found its way into the manufactured evidence against the Karas woman even though she was clean . I ca n't believe it was for sale . " " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale ? " " Not a code like that . You do n't buy a code that changes periodically , erratically , with no set schedule of change . " " What 's your point ? " Halyard interrupted . " Someone in Moscow had to provide that code , " said Bradford , raising his voice . " We may be closer to Parsifal than we think . " " What 's your thesis , Mr. Undersecretary ? " Brooks leaned forward , his elbow on the dais . " There 's someone trying to find Parsifal as frantically as we are  --  for the same reasons we are . Whoever he is , he 's here in Washington  --  he may be someone we see every day , but we do n't know who he is . I only know he 's working for Moscow , and the difference between him and us right now is that he 's been looking longer than we have . He knew about Parsifal before we did . And that means someone in Moscow knows . " Bradford paused . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever faced  --  the world has ever faced . There 's a mole here in Washington who could tip the balance of power  --  of basic global recognition of our physical and moral superiority , which is power  --  if he reaches Parsifal first . And he may , because he knows who he is and we don't. "  | The man in the dark overcoat and low-brimmed hat that shadowed his face climbed out of the two-toned coupe ; with difficulty he avoided stepping into a wide puddle by the driver 's door . The sounds of the night rain were everywhere , pinging off the hood and splattering against the glass of the windshield , thumping the vinyl roof and erupting in the myriad pools that had formed throughout the deserted parking area on the banks of the Potomac River . The man reached into his pocket , took out a gold-plated butane lighter and ignited it . No sooner had the flame erupted than he extinguished it ; replacing the lighter in his pocket , he kept his gloved hand there . He walked to the railing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thick mud that disappeared into the black flowing water . He raised his head and scanned the opposite shoreline ; the lights of Washington flickered in the downpour . Hearing the footsteps behind him , leather scraping over the soaked gravel , he turned . A man approached , coming into view through blocks of darkness . He wore a canvas poncho printed with the erratic shapes of green and black that denoted military issue . On his head was a heavy wide-brimmed  | leather hat , a cross between a Safari and a Digger . The face beneath the hat was thirtyish , hard , with a stubble of a beard and dull eyes set far apart , which could barely be seen between the squinting flesh . He had been drinking ; the grin that followed recognition was as grotesque as the rest of him . " Hey , how about it , huh ! " cried the man in the poncho , his speech guttural , slurred . " Wham ! Splat ! Boom . . . kaboom ! Like a fuckin ' gook rickyshaw hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ! " " Very fine work , " said the man in the overcoat . " You betch-er ass ! I caught ' em at the pass , and kaboom ! Hey , I ca n't hardly see you . It is you , ai n't it ? " " Yes , but you disappoint me . " " Why ? I did good ! " " You 've been drinking . I thought we agreed you would n't . " " A couple of balls , that 's all . In my room , not at no gin mill . . . no sir ! " " Did you talk with anyone ? " " Christ , no ! " " How did you get out here ? " " Like you said . On a bus . . . three buses . . . and I walked the last couple of miles . " " In the road ? " " Off it . Way off , like it was an S and D in Danang . " " Good . You 've earned your R and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , I mean . . . sir . " " What is it ? " " How come there was nothin ' in the papers ? I mean it was one big blow ! Musta ' burned for hours , seen for a couple of miles . How come ? " " They were n't important , Sergeant . They were only what I told you they were . Bad men who betrayed people like you and me , who stayed over here and let us get killed . " " Yeah , well , I evened a few scores . I guess I should go back now , huh ? To the hospital . " " You do n't have to . " The civilian who had been addressed as " Major " calmly took his gloved hand out of his pocket . In it was a .22-caliber automatic , concealed by the darkness and the rain . He raised it at his side and fired once . The man fell , his bleeding head sinking into the wet poncho . The  | civilian stepped forward , wiping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and spread the fingers of the dead man 's right hand . The two-tone coupe rounded the curve in the backcountry road , the headlights sweeping over a rock-strewn Maryland field , the high grass bending under the force of the wind and the night rain . The driver in the dark overcoat and low-brimmed hat saw what he expected to see and slowed down , switching off the lights before coming to a stop . On the shoulder of the road , standing motionless by a barbed-wire fence , was a glistening white ambulance , the license plates those of the federal government , the black lettering on the door proclaiming co-ownership with the taxpayer as well as the identification : BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL , EMERGENCY UNIT 14 . The driver drove the coupe alongside the long white vehicle . He took out his lighter , flicked the top and held the flame briefly toward the opposite window . The door of the ambulance opened , and a man in his late twenties jumped out into the rain , his government-issue raincoat parting to reveal the white uniform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pressing a button above his armrest . " Get in ! " he yelled through the sound of the downpour . " You 'll get soaked out there ! " The man climbed in , slamming the door shut and wiping his face with his right hand . He was Hispanic , his large eyes two stones of shining hard coal , his hair jet-black , matted to the dark skin of his forehead . " You owe me , mama , " said the Latin . " Oh , big mama owes me one big mouton de dinero . " " You 'll be paid , although I suppose I could say that you simply canceled an old debt you owed me . " " Olvidalo , mama Major ! " " You would have been executed in the field or still be pushing rocks around Leavenworth if it were n't for me . Do n't you forget it , Corporal . " " I wasted that shrinker for you ! You pay ! " " You wasted  --  as you put it  --  two MP 's in Pleiku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were n't you lucky I was around ? Two more MIA 's in a river . " " Sure , mama , real lucky ! Who was the puerco who told me about the truck ? You , Major ! "  | " I knew you were enterprising . These past years I 've kept my eye on you . You never saw me , but I saw you . I always knew where to find you , because debts should be paid . " " Yeah , well , you 're wrong , Major . I saw you the other night on the TV news . You were getting out of a big limousine in New York . At the United Nations place , was n't it ? It was you , was n't it ? " " I doubt it . " " Sure , it was ! I know big mama when I see her . You must be something ! You pay , mama . You 're going to pay a lot . " " My God , you 're irritating . " " Just pay me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the overcoat . " I gave it to you and I want it back . I protected you ; no one could trace it ballistically . " The hospital attendant reached into his raincoat pocket and took out a small gun , identical in size and caliber with the weapon the driver of the coupe had used an hour ago in a parking area overlooking the Potornac . " You wo n't find no bullets in it , " said the Hispanic , holding out the automatic in the darkness . " Here , take it . " " Give it to me . " " Take it ! For Christ 's sake , I ca n't see nothin ' in here ! Ouch ! Shit ! What the hell . . . ? " The driver 's hand had slipped beyond the short barrel of the weapon , pushing the attendant 's wide sleeve partially up his forearm . " Sorry , " said the man in the overcoat . " My class ring is twisted . Did I scrape you ? " " Forget it , mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Certainly . " The man took the gun and slipped it into his pocket . He picked up his lighter from his lap and ignited it ; on the seat between them was a stack of money held together with an elastic band . " There it is . Fifty one-hundred-dollar bills  --  laundered , of course . Do you want to count it ? " " What for ? I know where I can find you now , " said the attendant , opening the door . " And you 're going to see a lot of me , big mama . " " I look forward to it , " replied the driver . The wind again whipped the attendant 's raincoat away from his white uniform as he slammed the door and started toward the ambulance . The man in the coupe leaned over in the shadows , watching through the opposite window with his fingers on the door latch beside him , prepared to leap out of the car the instant he saw what he expected to see . The attendant began to stagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , his hands clutching the side of the ambulance . He raised his head and screamed , the rain pounding his face ; three seconds later he collapsed on the wet grass . The man in the overcoat jumped out of the coupe and walked around the trunk while removing a tubular glass object from his left pocket . He reached the attendant , knelt down and pushed the wide sleeve up the immobile arm . He then adjusted the glass vial in his left hand and , with his right , extracted a hypodermic needle . He plunged it into the soft flesh , depressed the shaft until the vial of white liquid was emptied into the arm , and let the long needle remain where it was , firmly embedded in the skin . Reaching across the attendant 's body , he pulled the lifeless hand toward the vial , pressed the fingers around the glass tube , with the thumb firmly down on the plunger , and then let the hand fall away . The man stood up , seeing in the night light the scattered bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant 's body . He turned and opened the door of the ambulance ; the inside was neat , the equipment in place , as befitted a trusted employee of the Bethesda Naval Hospital . He took out the small automatic from his pocket and threw it onto the seat . He then reached inside his overcoat for the contents of another pocket . Four additional glass vials , two filled , two empty . He checked the labels ; each read the same : Bethesda Naval Hospital Security-Control-Supply Contents : C17 H19 NO3 H2O MORPHINE He held them out and dropped them on the floor of the ambulance . Suddenly a gust of wind came swirling off the field , forcing the rain to fall in diagonal sheets . The man reached for his hat but it was too late . Caught in an updraft , the hat was lifted off his head and hurled against the side of the coupe . He walked across the grass to retrieve it . Even in the darkness the shock of white could be seen streaking from his forehead through his wavy black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his dripping hair was only part of his irritation . Time was running short . In his identity as Undersecretary of State Arthur Pierce , he would have to change his clothes and make himself presentable . A man in his position in the United States government did not run around in the mud and the pouring rain ;  | he would phone for his limousine the minute he reached home . He had agreed to have late-night drinks with the British ambassador , as there was another OPEC problem , matters of state to be attended to . It was not what his people in Moscow wanted , but knowledge of another Anglo-American oil strategy was not to be dismissed . All such information brought the Voennaya closer to the power they had been seeking since Yagoda set them on their path over a half century ago . Yet only the man who could not be found , the man who knew the secret of Anthony Matthias , could lead the Voennaya to its destiny  --  for the good of the world . Arthur Pierce , raised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ramenskoye , turned toward his car in the rain . There was no time to be tired , for the charade never stopped . Not for him . Ambassador Addison Brooks stared at Bradford across the dais . " You say this mole knows who Parsifal is , knew about him before we did ! " he exclaimed . " On what basis do you make that extraordinary statement ? " " Costa Brava , " said the undersecretary . " And the past seventy-two hours . " " Take them in sequence , " ordered the President . " In the final hours of Costa Brava , Havelock was provided with a radio transmitter whose frequency calibrations had been altered by CIA technicians in Madrid . They were working under blind orders ; they had no idea what the transmitter was for or who was going to use it . As you know , the entire Costa Brava assignment was controlled by a man named Steven MacKenzie , the most experienced black-operations officer in Central Intelligence ; the security was guaranteed . " " Completely , " interrupted Berquist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pulled him out of Barcelona . There was nothing suspicious . The doctor 's a respected , well-known physician and was thoroughly questioned . MacKenzie 's death was from natural causes . " " Only he knew all the details , " continued Bradford . " He 'd hired a boat , two men , and a blond woman who spoke Czech and was to scream in the distance  --  in the dark  --  during the grisly scene they were performing on that beach . The three of them were the dregs  --  small-time narcotics dealers and a prostitute  --  picking up a sizable fee . They did n't ask questions . Havelock sent out his transmission in KGB code to what he thought was a Baader-Meinhof unit in the boat offshore . MacKenzie caught it on his scanner and signaled the boat to come in . A few minutes later Have-  | lock saw what we wanted him to see  --  or he thought he saw it . The Costa Brava operation was over . " " Again , " interrupted the ambassador impatiently , " General Halyard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over , and except for the President and the three of us , no one else knew about it , " said the undersecretary , rushing ahead . " MacKenzie had structured it in fragments , no one group knowing what the other was doing . The only story we issued was the trapped-double-agent version , no buried reports , no file within a file that contradicted it . And with MacKenzie 's death , the last man on the outside who knew the truth was gone . " " The last man , perhaps , " said Halyard . " Not the last woman . Jenna Karas knew . She got away from you , but she knew . " " She knew only what she was told , and I was the one who spoke with her at the hotel in Barcelona . The story she was given had a dual purpose . One , to frighten her into doing exactly what we asked of her so we could ostensibly save her life ; and two , to put her into a disturbed frame of mind that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer if he had any last doubts or emotional hurdles . If she 'd followed my instructions she 'd be safe . Or if we 'd been able to find her , she would n't be running from the men who have to kill her now  --  and kill Havelock  --  so as to keep the truth about Costa Brava secret . Because they know the truth . " Ambassador Brooks whistled softly ; it was a low , swelling whistle , the sound made by a man genuinely astonished . " We 've reached the last seventy-two hours , " he said , " beginning with an untraceable call to Rome preceded by an authorization code established by Daniel Stern . " " Yes , sir . Col des Moulinets . I saw the outlines of the connection when I read the agent of record 's report , but nothing was clear . Just shapes , shadows . Then it became clearer when he told us here tonight the things he did . " " A man named Ricci he 'd never seen before , " said Brooks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a massive explosion that detonated some twelve minutes after the gunfire at the bridge , " added Bradford . " Then his description of the woman as a needle ' for the Soviets , a Russian plant that Moscow could have back and be taught a lesson . " " Which was a lie , " objected Halyard . " That bomb was meant for the car she was in . It killed how many ? Seven people on the road to the bridge ? Christ , it was powerful enough to blow that vehicle out of sight  | and everyone in it beyond recognition . And our own people were n't to know a goddamned thing about it . " " By way of a man named Ricci , " said Bradford , " a Corsican no one knew and two so-called small-arms backup personnel who were in reality explosives experts . They were sent by Rome , but the two who escaped never tried to get in touch with the embassy afterward . In our agent 's words , that 's not normal . They did n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people , " said Berquist . " But they did n't come from our people . They had a separate arrangement with the same person who made the last untraceable call from Washington to Rome . Ambiguity . " " That same person , Mr. President , who was able to reach into Moscow and pull out an authentic KGB code  --  anything less would never have been accepted by Havelock . Someone who knew the truth about Costa Brava , and was as anxious , perhaps as desperate , as we are to keep a blackout on it . " " Why ? " asked the general . " Because if we went back and examined every aspect of the operation we might find he was there . " The President and the general reacted as though each had been told of an unexpected death ; only Brooks remained impassive , watching Bradford carefully , a first-rate mind acknowledging the presence of another . " That 's a hell of a jump , son , " said Halyard . " I ca n't think of any other explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctioned , the sanction was understood even by those who respected his record . He 'd turned ; he was a psycho , ' a killer , dangerous to every man in the field . But why was the woman at Col des Moulinets to be sent across the border ? Why was the point made that she was a needle , ' a plant ? Why was her escape supposed to be a lesson to the Soviets , when all the while a bomb timed to explode minutes later would have blown her away beyond recognition ? " " To maintain the illusion that she had died at Costa Brava , said Brooks . " If she remained alive , she 'd ask for asylum and tell her story ; she 'd have nothing to lose . " " Forcing the events of that night on the beach to be reexamined , " the President said , completing the thought . " She had to be killed away from that bridge while still preserving the lie that she had died at Costa Brava . " " And the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halyard , frowning , with uncertainty in his voice , " who used the  | Ambiguity code and put this Ricci and the two nitro men in Col des Moulinets by way of Rome ... you say he was on the beach that night ? " " Everything points to it , yes , General . " " For Christ 's sake , why ? " " Because he knows Jenna Karas is alive , " replied Brooks , still watching Bradford . " At least , he knows she was n't killed at Costa Brava . No one else does . " " That 's speculation . It may have been kept quiet , but we 've been looking for her for nearly four months . " " Without ever acknowledging it was her , " explained the undersecretary , " without ever admitting she was alive . The alert was for a person , not a name . A woman whose expertise as a deep-cover agent could lead her to people she 'd worked with previously under multiple identities . The emphasis was on physical appearance and languages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Halyard shook his head , the gesture of a military strategist who sees a practical gap in a plan for a field maneuver . " MacKenzie put Costa Brava together in pieces , reporting only to you . The CIA in Langley did n't know about Madrid , and Barcelona was kept away from both . Under those conditions , how could someone penetrate what was n't there ? Unless you figure MacKenzie sold you out or loused it up . " " I do n't think either . " The undersecretary paused . " I think the man who took over the Ambiguity code was already involved with Parsifal months ago . He knew what to concentrate on and became alarmed when Havelock was ordered to Madrid under a Four Zero security . " " Someone with maximum clearance right here in the State Department , " the ambassador broke in . " Someone with access to confidential memoranda . " " Yes . He kept tabs on Havelock 's activities and saw that something was happening . He flew to Spain , picked him up in Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; so was MacKenzie . He almost certainly would have recognized me , and as I met with MacKenzie twice , it 's reasonable to assume we were seen together . " " And presuming you were , it 's also reasonable to assume that Moscow had a file on MacKenzie thick enough to alarm Soviet intelligence . " Brooks leaned forward , once again locking his eyes with Bradford 's . " A photograph wired to the KGB , and the man we 're looking for , who saw you together in Barcelona , knew a black operation was in progress . " " It could have happened that way , yes . "  | " With a lot of conjecture on your part , " said Halyard . " I do n't think the undersecretary of State is finished , Mal . " The ambassador nodded his head at the papers Bradford had just separated and was scanning . " I do n't believe he 'd permit his imagination to wander into such exotic regions unless something triggered it . Am I right ? " " Substantially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the President . " Yes , " said the man from State . " I suppose I could be prosecuted for what I did this afternoon , but I considered it essential . I had to get away from the phones and the interruptions ; I had to reread some of this material and provoke whatever imagination I have . I went to the classified files of Cons Op , removed Havelock 's summary of Costa Brava under Chemical Therapy ' and took it home . I 've been studying it since three o'clock  --  and remembering MacKenzie 's verbal report after he came back from Barcelona . There are discrepancies . " " In what way ? " asked Brooks . " In what MacKenzie planned and in what Havelock saw . " " He saw what we wanted him to see , " said the President . " You made a point of it a few minutes ago . " " He may have seen more than we think , more than MacKenzie engineered . " " MacKenzie was there , " protested Halyard . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was approximately seventy yards away from Havelock , with only a peripheral view of the beach . He was more concerned with watching Havelock 's reactions than with what was taking place below . He 'd rehearsed it a number of times with the two men and the blond woman . According to those practice sessions , everything was to take place near the water , the shots fired into the surf , the woman falling into the wet sand , her body rolling with the waves , the boat close by , within reach . The distance , the darkness  --  everything was for effect . " " Visually convincing , " interrupted Brooks . " Very , " agreed Bradford . " But it was n't what Havelock described . What he saw was infinitely more convincing . Under chemicals at the clinic in Virginia he literally relived the entire experience , including the emotional trauma that was part of it . He described bullets erupting in the sand , the woman running up to the road , not down by the water , and two men carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were hired , " said Halyard , perplexed . " What 's the prob-lem ? " " One had to be in the boat ; it was twenty feet offshore , the engine running . The second man was to have fired the shots and pulled the woman into the water , throwing her dead body ' into the boat . The distance , the darkness , the beam of a flashlight  --  these were part of MacKenzie 's scene , what he 'd rehearsed with the people he 'd hired . But the flashlight was the only constant between what MacKenzie planned and what Havelock saw . He did n't witness a performance ; he saw a woman actually killed . " Jesus . " The general sat back in his chair . " MacKenzie never mentioned any of this ? " said Brooks . " I do n't think he saw it . All he said to me was My employees must have put on a hell of a show . ' He stayed where he was on that hill above the road for several hours watching Havelock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't risk Havelock 's spotting him . " Addison Brooks brought his right hand to his chin . " So the man we 're looking for , the man who pulled the trigger at Costa Brava , who was given the Ambiguity code by Stern and put Havelock beyond salvage , ' is a Soviet agent in the State Department . " " Yes , " said the undersecretary . " And he wants to find Parsifal as desperately as we do , " concluded the President . " Yes , sir . " " Yet , if I follow you , " said Brooks quickly , " there 's an enormous inconsistency . He has n't passed on his astonishing information to his normal KGB controls . We 'd know it if he had . Good God , we 'd know it ! " " Not only has he held it back , Mr. Ambassador , he 's purposely misled one of the ranking directors of the KGB . " Bradford picked up the top page of his notes and slid it respectfully to the silver-haired statesman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not , incidentally , to startle you or shock you , but only because it did n't make any sense unless we looked at everything else in relationship to it . Frankly , I 'm still not sure I understand . It 's a cable from Pyotr Rostov in Moscow . He 's director of External Strategies , KGB . " " A cable from Soviet intelligence ? " said Brooks , astonished , picking up the paper . " Contrary to what most people believe , " added the undersecretary ,  | " strategists from opposing intelligence services often make contact with one another . They 're practical men in a deadly practical business . They ca n't afford wrong signals .... According to Rostov , the KGB had nothing to do with the Costa Brava and he wanted us to know it . Incidentally , Colonel Baylor in his report said that Rostov trapped Havelock in Athens , and although he could have gotten him out of Greece and into Russia by way of the Dardanelles , he chose not to . " " When did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , " answered the President . " We 've been studying it , trying to figure it out . Obviously , no response is called for . " " Read it , Addison , " said Halyard . " It was sent to D. S. Stern , Director of Consular Operations , United States Department of ? " Brooks looked up at Bradford . " Stern was killed three days ago . Would n't Rostov have known that ? " " He would n't have sent it if he had . He would n't have permitted the slightest speculation that the KGB was involved in Stern 's death . He sent that cable because he did n't know Stern was dead  --  or the others . " " Only Miller 's death was released , " said Berquist . " We could n't keep it quiet ; it was all over Bethesda . We put a blackout on Stern and Dawson , at least for the time being , until we could learn what was happening . We moved their families to the Cheyenne security compound in Colorado Springs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooks held the paper under the glare of the Tensor lamp . He spoke slowly , reading in a monotone . " The betrayal at Costa Brava was not ours . Nor was the bait taken in Athens . The infamous Consular Operations continues its provocative actions and the Soviet Union continues to protest its disregard for human life as well as the crimes and terrorist acts it inflicts upon the innocent  --  peoples and nations alike . And should this notorious branch of the American Department of State believe it has collaborators within the walls of Dzerzhinsky , be assured such traitors will be rooted out and face the punishments demanded . I repeat , Costa Brava was not ours . ' " The statesman finished ; the cable was over . He let his hand drop to the dais , the page still held between his thumb and forefinger . " Good Lord , ' he whispered . " I understand the words , " said Halyard , " but not what he 's trying to tell us . " " Better a Satan you know than one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no walls in Dzerzhinsky Square . "  | " That 's it , " said Bradford , turning to the President . " That 's what we did n't connect with . The walls are in the Kremlin . " " Outside and inside , " continued the former ambassador . " He 's telling you that he knows Costa Brava could not have taken place without a collaborator or collaborators in Moscow ? " " We understood that , " interrupted Berquist . " What about the walls ? The Kremlin ? How do you read that ? " " He 's warning us . He 's saying he does n't know who they are , and since he does n't , they 're not controllable . " " Because they 're outside the normal channels of communication ? " asked the President . " Even abnormal channels , " said Brooks . " A power struggle . " Berquist turned to the undersecretary . " Has there been anything of a serious nature about this from any of our intelligence departments ? " " Only the usual frictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ambitious . " " Where do the generals stand ? " inquired the general . " Half wanting to blow up Omaha , half wanting SALT Three . " " And Parsifal could unite them , " said the statesman . " All their hands would be on the nuclear switches . " " But Rostov does n't know about Parsifal , " protested Bradford . " He has , to conception ? " " He senses it , " the ambassador broke in . " He knows Costa Brava was a Department of State operation somehow in conjunction with elements in Moscow . He 's tried to trace them down and ca n't ; that alarms him immensely . There 's an imbalance , a shift from the norm at the highest levels . " " Why do you say that ? " The President took the cable from Brooks , scrutinizing it as if trying to see what he had not seen before . " It 's not in there , sir , " said Bradford , nodding at Brooks as he spoke . " Except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't take Havelock in Athens . Rostov 's aware of the very unusual relationship between Michael Havelock and Anthony Matthias . Czech and Czech , teacher and student , survivors really  --  in many ways father and son ; where does one end and the other begin ? Is one or are both of them dealing with someone in Moscow ? And for what purpose ? Reasonable objectives can be ruled out ; avoiding normal channels would indicate that . Not too many months ago we wondered the same thing : What had  | Matthias done , and where did Havelock stand ? We created Costa Brava because of it . " " And then Parsifal reached us and it did n't make any difference , " interrupted Berquist . " We were at the wall . We 're still at the wall  --  only , now it 's grown larger , broken away from itself until there are two walls , our backs to each no matter which way we turn . The search for Parsifal is joined with another search for another man . Someone right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet mole capable of pulling a buried code out of Moscow , and deep enough to change the face of Costa Brava . ... My God , we 've got to blow him out of the ground ! If he finds Parsifal before we do , he and the madmen he answers to in the Kremlin can dictate whatever terms they like to this country . " " You know where he is , " said the general . " Go after him ! He 's at State . High up ; with access to embassy cables , and obviously goddamned close to Matthias . Because if I follow you now , he nailed the Karas woman . He supplied that code ; he had it placed in her suitcase . He nailed her ! " " I think he supplied everything . " Bradford shook his head slowly , arching his brows , as if recalling the impossible . " Including the suitcase , the Baader-Meinhof informer , our own codes and the instructions from Moscow . Everything just appeared in Barcelona  --  out of nowhere . And no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointless to press Matthias further ? " said Brooks , asking the question nevertheless . " Pointless , " replied Bradford . " He repeats what he 's maintained from the beginning . The evidence was there . It was true . It was channeled to , me . " The bells are heard by Saint Anthony ! " exploded the President . " The mole at State , " Halyard persisted . " Good Christ , he ca n't be that hard to find . How many people would Stern talk to ? What kind of time frame was involved ? A few minutes ? A few hours ? Go back and trace every move he made . " " The Cons Op strategists operated in total secrecy , " said Bradford . " There were no appointment calendars , no conference schedules . A call would come to a specific person upstairs , or over at the Agency , or the NSC , and the decks would be cleared for whichever strategist it was , but no record of the meeting was ever written down . Internal security again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with access to such records or memoranda . "  | " Misdirect the flow of accurate information at all costs , " said the President softly . " By our estimates , Stern could have spoken to any of sixty to seventyfive people , " continued Bradford . " And we could be underestimating that figure . There are authorities within teams of specialists , specialists among those considered authorities . The lists are endless , and all those people have maximum clearance . " " But we 're talking about the State Department , " said Brooks emphatically . " Sometime between Stern 's last conversation with Rome and four hours later when the authorization was given to Col des Moulinets . That narrows down the possibilities considerably . " " And whoever it is knows that , " said the undersecretary . " It further obscures his movements . Even the check-ins and check-outs wo n't show him to be where he was . " " Did n't anyone see Stern ? " persisted Brooks . " Surely , you 've asked . " " As quietly as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him within twenty-four hours of the period in question , but then we did n't expect the one who did to say so . " " Nobody saw him ? " asked the general , frowning in disbelief . " Well , yes , someone did , " said Bradford , nodding . " The outside receptionist on the fifth floor , L Section . Dawson had left a message for Stern ; lie picked it up on his way to the elevator . He could have been in any of seventy-five offices beyond the reception-room door . " " Who was inside at the time ? " The ambassador shook his head the instant he asked the question , as if to say , Sorry , never mind . " Exactly , " said Bradford , accepting the statesman 's unspoken afterthought . " It was n't any help . Twenty-three people were listed as not having checked out . There were conferences , secretaries taking notes , and briefings by division personnel . Everything was substantiated . No one left a meeting long enough to place that call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floor ! " cried the soldier . " Seventy-five offices , seventy-five people . That 's not a hundred and fifty , or a thousand ; it 's seventy-five and one of them 's your mole ! Start with those closest to Matthias and pull them in . Put every goddamn one of them into a clinic if you have to ! " " There 'd be panic ; the entire State Department would be demoralized , " said Brooks . " Unless  --  Is there a clique , a particular group , closest to Matthias ? "  | " You do n't understand him . " Bradford brought his folded hands to his chin , searching for words . " He 's first , last and always Dr. Matthias , teacher , enlightener , provoker of thought . He 's a hustling Socrates on the Potomac , gathering his worshipers wherever he can find them , extolling those who see the light , striking down the disbelievers with the cruelest humor I 've ever heard . Cruel but always couched in brilliantly humble phrases . And like most self-appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hell . A section will catch his eye and they 're his fair-haired boys and girls for a while , until another group comes along and flatters him at the right moment , and there 's suddenly a new court of supplicants he can lecture . Naturally , during the past year it 's gotten worse ? but it was always there . " Bradford permitted himself the start of a strained smile . " Then , of course , I could be biased . I was never allowed in one of those charmed circles . " " Why do you think you were excluded ? " asked the ambassador . " I 'm not sure . I had a certain reputation of my own once ; perhaps he was uncomfortable with it . But I think it was because I used to watch him very closely , very hard . I was fascinated , and I know he was uncomfortable with that . . . . You see , the best and the brightest ' were led down a lot of strange paths by men like him . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthias approved of that growth . Skepticism comes with it . The Thomistic leap is n't good enough anymore ; blind faith can ruin the eyesight ? and the perspective . " Bradford leaned forward , his eyes on Halyard . " I 'm sorry , General . My answer to both you and Ambassador Brooks is that there is no one group I 'd zero in on , no guarantee that our mole would be caught before he panicked and ran . And we ca n't let that happen . I know I 'm right . If we can find him , he can lead us to the man we call Parsifal . He may have lost him temporarily , but he knows who Parsifal is . " The older men were silent ; they looked at each other , then turned back to Bradford . The general frowned , a questioning look in his clear eyes . The President nodded his head slowly , bringing his right hand to his cheek and staring at the man from State . The ambassador spoke , his slender figure rigid in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I try to reconstruct the new scenario ? . .. For reasons unknown , Matthias needed an . incontrovertible case against the Karas woman , which would lead to Havelock 's retirement . By now , because of what he 's done , Matthias is Parsifal 's puppet  --  his prisoner , really  --  but Parsifal knows it 's in his interest to carry out Matthias 's obsession . He goes to a well-entrenched Soviet agent in the upper regions  | of the State Department and the incriminating evidence against the Karas woman is provided , studied and accepted . Except that two source controls from the CIA come to you and tell you it ca n't be true  --  any of it  --  and you , Emory Bradford , enter the picture . In fact , the President , alarmed by what appears to be a conspiracy at State brings us all into the picture ? and we in turn recruit a black-operations officer to mount the Costa Brava exercise . That exercise  --  that scene  --  is turned into murder , and at this juncture , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . Parsifal , whoever he is , got what he wanted from the mole , then dropped him . The mole is stunned , possibly frantic . He 's undoubtedly wade promises to Moscow  --  based on assurances from Parsifal  --  that projected a major setback for American foreign policy , conceivably its collapse . " " Either , " interjected the President in a quiet monotone , " would be a benevolent alternative . " " And whoever has the information contained in Parsifal 's documents will assume control of the Kremlin . " Brooks remained rigid , his aristocratic face pale , drawn . " We 're at war , " he added softly . " I repeat , " said Halyard . " Go after those seventy-five offices at State . Mount a sweep , call it a medical quarantine ; it 's simple but effective , even acceptable . Do it in the early evening after they 've left work . Round them up in their homes , restaurants ; pull them in and get them down to your laboratories . Find your mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed the civilians , who remained silent . Halyard lowered his voice . " I know it smells , but I do n't think you 've got a choice . " " We 'd need two hundred men posing as medical technicians and drivers , " said Bradford . " Between thirty and forty government vehicles . No one knowing anything . " " We 'd also be dealing with families and neighbors and technicians ' knocking on doors at night , " countered Berquist . " Christ , that son of a bitch ! That man for all seasons ! " The President stopped ; he took a deep breath , then continued , " We 'd never get away with it ; the rumors would spread like a Mesabi brush fire in a dry July . The press would break it open and call us everything in the book , everything we deserve . Mass arrests without explanation  --  there 's none we could give  --  interrogations without clue process , storm troopers . . . chemicals . We 'd be crucified on every editorial page in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every pulpit and soapbox , to say nothing of the acid from mu legislative brethren . I 'd be impeached. "  | " More important , Mr. President , " said the ambassador , " and I 'm sorry to say I mean that , the action itself would undoubtedly throw Parsifal into panic . He 'd see what we were doing , know whom we were trying to unearth in order to find him . He could carry out his threats , carry out the inconceivable . " " Yes , I know . We 're damned if we move , helpless if we do n't . " " It could work , " persisted the general . " Handled correctly , it might , Mr. President , " added Bradford . " For God 's sake , how ? " " Anyone who objected strenuously , to the point of refusal or evasion , would probably be our man , " replied Bradford . " Or someone with something else to hide , " said Brooks gently . " We 're in the age of anxiety , Mr. Undersecretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for privacy . You might very well corner a person who has nothing more to conceal than an unopened closet , or the loathing of a superior , an unpopular viewpoint , or an office affair . Parsifal will see only what his insanity compels him to see . " Bradford listened , reluctantly accepting the statesman 's judgment . " There 's another approach we have n't had time to implement . An itinerary check . Tracing the whereabouts of every person on that floor during the week of Costa Brava . If we 're right  --  if I 'm not wrong  --  he was n't here . He was in Madrid , in Barcelona . " " He 'd cover himself , " objected Halyard . " Regardless , General , he 'd have to account for being away from Washington . How many such absences can there be ? " " When can you start ? " asked Berquist . " First thing in the morning ? " " Why not tonight ? " the general interrupted . " If those records were accessible , I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open them at this hour would cause talk . We ca n't afford that . " " Even in the morning , " said the ambassador , " how can you suppress curiosity , keep it quiet ? " Bradford paused before speaking , his eyes cast downward , seeking an answer . " Time study , " he replied , looking up , the phrase bordering on a question . " I 'll tell whoever controls those records that it 's a routine time study . Someone 's always doing something like that . " " Acceptable , " agreed Brooks . " Banal and acceptable . " " Nothing 's acceptable , " said the President of the United States quietly ,  | staring at the white wall , where an hour ago the faces of four dead men had been projected . " A man for all seasons , ' they call him . The original was a scholar , a statesman , the creator of Utopia . . . and a burner of heretics  --  they conveniently forget that , do n't they ? Condemn the nonbelievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm  --  inviolate . ' . . . Goddamn it , if I had my way , I 'd do what fat Henry did with Thomas More . I 'd cut off Matthias 's head , and instead of London Bridge , I 'd jam it on top of the Washington Monument as a reminder . Heretics , too , are citizens of the republic and so , holy man , there can be no heresy ! Goddamn him ! " " You know what would happen , do n't you , Mr. President ? " " Yes , Mr. Ambassador , I do . The people would look up at that bleeding neck , at that ever-benign face  --  no doubt with those tortoiseshell glasses still intact  --  and in their infinite wisdom they 'd say he was right , had been right all along . Citizens  --  heretics included  --  would canonize him , and that 's the lousy irony . " " He could still do it , I think , " Brooks mused . " He could walk out and the cries would start again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd persist  --  until it became inevitable . Another irony . Hail not Caesar but Anthony  --  a coronation . A constitutional amendment would he rammed through the House and the Senate and President Matthias would sit in the Oval Office . As incredible as it might seem , he could probably still do it . Even now . " " Maybe we should let him , " said Berquist softly , bitterly . " Maybe the people  --  in their infinite wisdom  --  are right , after all . Maybe he 's been right all along . Sometimes I do n't know anymore . Perhaps he really does see things others do n't see . Even now . " The aristocratic statesman and the plainspoken general left the underground room . The four would meet again at noon the next day , each arriving separately at the South Portico entrance , away from the inquisitive eyes of the White House press corps . If , in the morning , there were any startling developments in Bradford 's research at State , the time would be moved up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedence . He could lead them to a madman the President and his advisers called Parsifal . " I commend you , Mr. Undersecretary , " said Berquist , lowering his voice in an amateur 's imitation of the ambassador 's fluid and graceful speech . It was an imitation with only a trace of rancor ; respect was also there . " tic 's the last of the originals , is n't he ? "  | " Yes , sir . There are n't many left , and none that I know of who care that much . Taxes and the great democratization have removed them ? or alienated them . They feel uncomfortable , and I think it 's the country 's loss . " " Do n't be sepulchral , Emory , it does n't suit you . We need him ; the power brokers on the Hill are still in awe of him . If there ever was an answer to Matthias , it 's Addison Brooks . The Mayflower and Plymouth Rock , New York 's Four Hundred and fortunes built on the backs of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benevolent liberals who weep at the sight of swollen black bellies in the Mississippi Delta . But for Christ 's sake , do n't take away the Chateau d'Yquem . " " Yes , Mr. President . " " You mean No , Mr. President . ' It 's in your eyes , Emory ; it 's always in the eyes . Do n't mistake me , I admire old elegant-ass , respect what 's in that head of his . Just as I think Tightrope Halyard 's one of the few military relics who 've actually read the Constitution and understand what civilian authority really means . It 's not that war 's too important to leave to the generals ; that 's horseshit . We 'd both be rotten pincering up the Rhine . It 's the ending of wars , the aftermath . The generals are reluctant to accept the first and have no concept of the second . Halyard 's different , and the Pentagon knows it . The Joint Chiefs listen to him because he 's better than they are . We need him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this office is all about . Need . Not likes or dislikes , only need . If I ever get back to Mountain Iron , Minnesota , alive and in one piece , I can think about whether I like someone or not . But I ca n't do that now . It 's only what I need . And what I need right now is to stop Parsifal , stop what he 's done , what he did to Anthony Matthias . " The President paused , then continued , " I meant what I said  --  he said . I do commend you . It was a hell of a job . " " Thank you , sir . " " Especially what you did n't say . Havelock . Where is he ? " " Almost certainly in Paris ; it 's where jenna Karas was heading . Between pages this afternoon I placed a number of calls to people I know in the Assembly , the Senate , several ministries , the Quai d'Orsay , and our own embassy . I applied pressure , hinting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning you by name . " " You could have . " " Not yet , Mr. President . Perhaps never , but certainly not now . "  | " Then we understand each other , " said Berquist . " Yes , sir . Necessity . " " Halyard might have understood ; he 's a practical soldier . Brooks would n't ; underneath that diplomatic exterior he 's a thorough moralist . " " That was my assessment , why I did n't clarify Havelock 's status . " " It remains what it was at Col des Moulinets . If he exposed Costa Brava , it would panic Parsifal more quickly than anything we might do in the State Department . Havelock was at the center  --  from the beginning . " " I understand , sir . " Berquist 's eyes strayed to the blank white screen at the far end of the room . " In World War Two , Churchill had to make a decision that tore him apart . The German code machine Enigma had been broken by Allied intelligence , a feat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hundreds of thousands  --  ultimately perhaps millions  --  of lives could be saved . Word came that a massive air strike had been called against Coventry . It was a single transmission , coded through Enigma . But acknowledging it , evacuating the city or even mounting sudden , abnormal defenses , would have revealed that the riddle of Enigma had been solved . . . . Coventry had to be bombed half out of existence so the secret could be kept . The secret of Costa Brava can not be exposed for the same reason  --  millions of lives are in the balance . . . . Find 1 lavelock , Mr. Undersecretary . Find him and have him killed . Reinstate the order for his execution . "  | Havelock knew he had been spotted : a newspaper was abruptly lowered as he walked between the roped stanchions of Air France 's disembarkation lounge at Kennedy into the corridor that led to immigration . He had been pre-cleared on diplomatic status , the papers Broussac had provided guaranteeing a rapid exit through U.S. customs , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers as quickly as possible . He carried his small suitcase  --  officially lock-taped and stamped Diplomatique in Paris  --  and once through the corridor he would be admitted through the heavy metal doors that led into the terminal by simply showing his United Nations credentials and declaring that he had no other luggage . A dead-file name would be checked against a dead-file name on the manifest , and he would be free to search or be killed in the United States of America . It was all so simple . However , for Regine Broussac 's protection  --  and ultimately his own ? he had to get rid of the false papers that made all this possible . Too , he had to find out who had lowered the newspaper . The gray-faced man had risen slowly from his seat , folding the newspaper under his arm , and started for the outer , crowded hallway that paralleled the inner corridor that led to questionable freedom . Who was that man ? If he could not find out , it was entirely possible that he would be killed  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker named Jacob Ilandelman . And that was not acceptable . The uniformed immigration officer was astute , polite . He asked the proper questions while looking Havelock directly in the eyes . " You have no luggage , sir ? " " Non , monsieur . Only the one piece here . " " Then you do n't expect to be on First Avenue very long ? " " A day , forty-eight hours , " replied Michael with a Gallic shrug . " Une con ference . " " I 'm sure your government has made arrangements for transportation into the city . Would n't you care to wait for the rest of your party ? " The official was very good , thought Havelock . " Forgive me , monsieur , you force me to be candid . " Michael smiled awkwardly , as though his dignity had been somewhat compromised . " There is a lady waiting for me ; we see each other so seldom . Perhaps it is noted on your information , I was posted at  --  First Avenue for several months last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " Slowly the official returned the smile as he checked off the name and reached for a button . " Have a good day , sir , " he said . " Many thanks , " said Havelock , walking rapidly through the parting steel checkpoint . Vivent les amours des gentilhommes francais , he thought . The gray-faced man was standing by a short row of telephones , each occupied ; he was second in line behind the third . The newspaper , which had been folded under the arm , was instantly removed and snapped open . t lc had not been able to make his call , and under the circumstances that was the best sight Michael could hope to see . He started walking in the man 's direction , passing him quickly and looking straight ahead . He took his first left into an intersecting wide corridor crowded with streams of departing passengers heading for their gates . He swung right into a narrower hallway , this one with far fewer people and the majority of these in the uniforms of the various airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still narrow , even fewer people , mostly men in white overalls and in shirt sleeves ; he had entered some kind of freight complex , the office section . There were no passengers , no business suits , no briefcases or carry-on bags . There were no public telephones . The walls were stark , broken up by widely spaced glass doors . The nearest phones were far behind , around the corner in the first , main hallway . Out of sight . t le found the men 's room ; it said , AIRPORT EMPLOYERS ONLY . Michael  | pushed the door open and walked inside . It was a large tiled room , two air vents whirring on the far wall , no windows . A row of toilet stalls was on the left , sinks and urinals on the right . A man in overalls with the words Excelsior Airline Caterers was positioned in front of the fourth urinal ; a flush came from one of the stalls . Havelock went to a sink , placing his suitcase under it . The man at the urinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Michael , his eyes taking in an expensive dark suit purchased that morning in Paris . Then , as if to say , All right , Mr. Executive , I 'll wash my hands , he ambled to the nearest sink and turned on the water . A second man emerged from a stall ; he pulled his belt taut and started for the door , swearing under his breath , the plastic I.D . tag pinned to his shirt indicating he was a harried supervisor . The man in overalls ripped a paper towel out of a stainless-steel machine , cursorily wiped his hands and threw the brown paper into a receptacle . He opened the door and stepped out . As the door swung back Havelock ran to catch it , holding it open no more than an inch , and peered outside . The unknown surveillance was fifty-odd feet up the corridor , casually leaning against the wall next to an office door , reading the folded newspaper . He looked at his watch , then glanced at the frosted glass panel ; he was the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join him for a late lunch or drinks , or a drive to a motel near the airport . There was nothing menacing about him , but in that control Michael knew there was menace , professionalism . Still , two could have control , two could wait , be professional . The advantage belonged to the one behind a door ; he knew what was inside . The one outside did not , and could not afford to move away  --  to a telephone , perhaps  --  because once he was out of sight the quarry could escape . Wait . Keep the control . And get rid of the false papers that could lead the pursuers to Regine Broussac and a halfway man named Jacob Handelman . A dead-file name on an aircraft 's manifest was meaningless , inserted by mindless computers that could not say who punched the keys , but the papers could be traced to their origin . Havelock tore the documents into shreds , which he flushed down a toilet . With a penknife he sliced the ribbed Diplomatique tape , which guaranteed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stall at the end of the row . He removed the short-barreled Llama automatic from beneath his folded  | clothes , and a passport case containing his own very authentic papers . Presented properly , the papers were essentially harmless . The objective , however , was not to have to present them at all , and they were rarely required in the streets of his adopted country , one of the benefits for which he was profoundly thankful . Between the time he destroyed the mocked-up papers and inserted his passport case and weapon in their proper places , the employees ' men 's room had two more visitors . They came in together  --  an Air France pilot and his first officer , to judge from their conversation ; Michael remained in the stall . They argued , urinated , swore at preflight red tape , and wondered how much their Havana Monte Cristos would bring at the bar of I . ' Auberge an Coin , a restaurant apparently in midtown Manhattan . They continued talking about their profits on the way out . I lavelock took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited in the stall . He held the door open no more than a quarter of an inch and looked at his watch . He had been inside the lavatory nearly fifteen minutes . It would happen soon , he thought . It did . The white metal door swung slowly back and Havelock saw part of a shoulder first , then the edge of a folded newspaper . The unknown surveillance was professional : no folded jacket or coat concealed a gun ? no draped cloth that could be grabbed and twisted , to be used against the holder  --  just a loose newspaper that could be easily discarded and the weapon fired cleanly . The man whipped around the door , his back against the metal panel , his eyes scanning the walls , the vents , the row of stalls . Satisfied , he bent his knees , lowering himself , but apparently not for the purpose of checking the open spaces under the doors of the first several stalls . His eyes darted back and forth . His body was turned away from Michael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the image of another professional on the bridge ? t Col des Moulinets came to Michael , a blond professional in the ** of an Italian guard . But the killer " Ricci " had come prepared , knowing what his landscape was , knowing there was a gatehouse door to be jammed . This gray-faced professional had improvised , the test of onsite ingenuity . He had broken off a piece of wood , a small strip of cheap industrial molding  --  found in a dozen places in any airport corridor  --  and was now wedging it under the door . He stood up , placed his foot against the strip , and pulled on the metal knob . The door was jammed ; they were alone ' flue man turned .  | Peering from inside the stall , Havelock studied him . The menace was not at first glance in the man 's physical equipment . He was perhaps in his mid-fifties , with thinning hair above a flat gray face with thick eyebrows and high cheekbones . He was no more than five feet , eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , Michael saw the left hand  --  the right was concealed beneath the newspaper ; it was huge , a peasant 's powerful hand , formed by years of working with heavy objects and equipment . The man started down the row of stalls , the sides of each about two inches above the tiled floor , which made it necessary for him to be within three feet of a front panel to ascertain whether it was occupied . Wearing shoes with thick rubber soles , he moved in total silence . Suddenly he spun his right hand in a circle , flipping off the newspaper . Havelock stared at the gun as the intruder approached the final three stalls . He was angry but bewildered  --  the weapon was a Graz-Burya . The Russian bent over .. . Now . Michael threw his rolled-up suit jacket over the side of the stall on his right . The sound made the Russian leap up , spinning to his left , his gun raised . In simultaneous movements Havelock grabbed the handle of his suitcase and yanked the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the gray-faced man . He reached for the Graz-Burya with his left hand and tore it out of the man 's hand . The Russian spun away , his powerful arms blocking Havelock ; Michael used them  --  he locked the man 's left arm under his right , wrenched it forward until the Russian 's face was stretched in pain , then he pried the weapon loose and crashed the barrel into the man 's head . As the Russian started to fall , Havelock crouched and jammed his shoulder into the man 's kidney , propelling him back into the row of urinals . The gray-faced man fell to his knees , supporting himself on his right hand and holding his left arm across his chest in pain . He gasped for breath , shaking his head . " Nyet , nyet , " he choked . " Talk only ! Only talk . " " With the door as good as locked and a gun in your hand ? " " Would you have agreed to a conversation if I had come up and introduced myself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried me . " " You did not stay still long enough . . . . May I ? " The Russian leaned back on his knees , holding his arm and raising one leg as he requested permission to stand .  | " Go ahead , " said Havelock , the Graz-Burya steady in his hand . " You were trying to make a phone call . " " Certainly . To relay word that you had been found . What would you have done ? Or I do n't know , perhaps I should not ask . " " What do you know ? How did you find me ? " Michael raised the gun , aiming it at the man 's head . " I 'd advise you to tell me the truth . I have n't got a thing to lose with your corpse in here . " The Russian stared at the barrel and then at Havelock 's eyes . " No , you have nothing to lose ; you would not hesitate . A younger man should have been sent out here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did n't . No one knows anywhere .... A VKR officer was shot in Paris ; he had nowhere to turn but to us . " " An importing firm on the Beaumarchais ? " interrupted Michael . " KGB headquarters , Paris ? " The Russian overlooked the interruption . " We knew you had connections throughout the French government . Military intelligence , the Quai d'Orsay , the Deputies . If it was your intention to leave France , there was only one way you could do it . Diplomatic cover . All Air France flights listing diplomatic personnel are being watched . Everywhere . London , Rome , Bonn , Athens , the Netherlands , all of South America  --  everywhere . It 's my misfortune that you chose to come back here ; it was not expected . You are beyond salvage . ' " " That seems to be a well-publicized piece of information . " " It has been circulated in certain quarters . " " Is that what you wanted to talk about ? Because if it is , Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I bring you a message from Pyotr Rostov . He believes that after Rome , you might listen . " " Rome ? What about Rome ? " " The Palatine . It would seem it was conclusive for you . You were meant to die on the Palatine . " " I was ? " Havelock watched the man 's eyes , the set of his lips . So Rostov knew about the Palatine ; it was to be expected . Bodies had been found there : the corpse of a former American agent known for jugular operations and his two wounded Italian drones who had nothing to lose and something to bargain with by telling the truth . Certainly Moscow knew . But Rostov did not know about Jenna Karas or Col des Moulinets , or he would have included them in his opening lure . Under different circumstances it  | might have been necessary for the words to have been shouted quickly : Jenna Karas is alive ! Col des Moulinets ! Both were far more persuasive . " What 's the message ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsidered . He 'll take it now and thinks you should agree . He says he 's not your enemy any longer , but others are who may be his as well . " " What does that mean ? " " I ca n't answer you , " said the man , his thick eyebrows motionless above his deep-set peasant eyes . " I 'm merely the messenger . The substance is for you to know , not me . " " You knew about the Palatine . " " The death of a maniac travels fast , especially if he 's your adversary ? most especially if he 's killed a number of your friends . . . . What was the name his own people gave him ? The Gunslinger , I believe . A romantic figure from your Western films , which , incidentally , I enjoy immensely . But in history such a fellow was invariably a filthy , unprincipled pig , devoid of morals or ideology , motivated solely by profit or pathological brutality . In these times he might be the president of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save it for the state schools . " " Rostov would like a reply , but you do n't have to give it at once . I can reach you . A day , two days  --  a few hours from now . You may name the drop . We can get you out . To safety . " Again Michael studied the Russian 's face . Like Rostov in Athens before him , the man was relaying the truth  --  as he knew the truth , and as he knew the word of his superior in Moscow . " What does Rostov offer ? " " I told you . Safety . You know what 's ahead of you here . The Palatine . " " Safety in exchange for what ? " " That 's between you and Rostov . Why should I invent conditions ? You would not believe them . " " Tell Rostov he 's wrong . " " About Rome ? The Palatine ? " " The Palatine , " said Havelock , wondering briefly if a KGB director ten thousand miles away would perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need the safety of the Lubyanka . " " You refuse his offer , then ? " " I refuse the bait . " There was a sudden thud against the men's-room door , followed by a muffled voice swearing , then repeated banging against the metal panel .  | The strip of wood wedged under the door scraped the tile ; it gave less than an inch , which was enough to make the intruder shout while continuing to pound , " Hey , what the hell is this ! Open up ! " The Russian glanced at the door ; Havelock did not . The man spoke rapidly : " Should you change your mind , there is a row of trash cans in Bryant Park , behind your Public Library . Place a red mark on the front of one of them  --  I suggest a felt marker or , better yet , a spot of woman 's nail polish . Then , starting at ten o'clock that same night , walk north and south on Broadway , between Forty-second and Fifty-third streets , staying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the address of the contact . It will be outside , naturally . No traps . " " What 's going on in there ? Fa ' Christ 's sake , open this goddamned door ! " " I thought you said I could pick the drop . " " You may . Simply tell the man who reaches you where you want to meet . Just give us three hours . " " To sweep it ? " " Son of a bitch ! Open up ! " The metal door was smashed back several inches , the strip of wood scratching against the tiles . A second , authoritative voice joined that of the angry intruder . " All right , what 's this all about ? " " The door 's jammed ! I ca n't get in , but I hear ' em talkin ' ! They jammed the fuckin ' door ! " Another crash , another screech , another inch . " We take precautions , just as you do , " said the Russian . " What 's between you and Rostov ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow , I am not in Moscow . I do not call for the police when I 'm iii trouble in New York City . " " All right in there ! " shouted the second voice in lower-register officiousness . " Fair warning , you punks ! Obstruction of normal operating procedures at an international airport constitutes a felony , and that includes the toilets ! I 'm calling Airport Security ! " The stern-toned one addressed the angry intruder . " If I were you , I 'd find another men 's room . These kids use needles ; they can get hopped up and pretty violent . " " I 've got ta take one pisser of a leak , man ! And they do n't sound like no kids ? There 's a cop ! Hey , Fuzz ! " " Ile ca n't hear you . He 's walking past . I 'll get to a phone . " " Shit ! " " Let 's go , " said Havelock , reaching down for his jacket and slipping it on .  | " My life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse in a men 's room ? " " I want my reply delivered . Forget the nail polish on those trash cans . " " Then , if I may , my weapon , please ? " " I 'm not that charitable . You see , you are my enemy . You have been for a long time . " " It 's difficult to explain a missing weapon . You understand . " " Tell them you sold it on the open market ; it 's the first step in capitalism . Buy cheap  --  or get it for nothing  --  and sell high . The Burya 's a good gun ; it 'd bring a large profit . " " Please ! " " You do n't understand , comrade . You 'd be surprised how many hustlers in Moscow would respect you . Come on ! " Havelock grabbed the man by the shoulder , propelling him toward the door . " Kick out the wood , " he ordered , shoving the weapon into his belt and picking up his suitcase . The Russian did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoe on the protruding wedge , moving it back and forth , as he pushed the door shut . The wedge came loose ; he swept it away with his foot and pulled the door open . " Jesus Christ ! " exclaimed an obese man in sky-blue overalls . " A couple of fuckin ' fairies ! " " They 're coming ! " yelled a shirt-sleeved man , running out of an office door across the corridor . " I think you 're too late , Mr. Supervisor , " said the wide-eyed freight employee , staring at Havelock and the Russian . " Here 're your fuckin ' punks . Two old queens who figured the parking lot was too cold . " " Let 's go ! " whispered Havelock , grabbing the Russian 's elbow . " Disgusting ! Revolting ! " shouted the supervisor . " At your age ! Have you no shame ? Perverts everywhere ! " " You wo n't change your mind about the weapon ? " asked the Russian , walking breathlessly up the corridor , wincing as Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely disciplined . I have n't used it in years ; it 's really a form of dress , you know . " " Perverts ! You should all be in jail , not in public toilets ! You 're a menace ! " " I 'm telling you , you 'll get a promotion if the right people think you made a bundle . " " Faggots ! " " Let go of my arm . That idiot 's marking us. "  | " Why ? You 're adorable . " They reached the second hallway , turning left toward the center of the terminal . There were , as before , men in overalls and shirt sleeves milling about , watching an occasional secretary emerge from an office door . Up ahead was the main corridor , crowds surging in both directions , toward departing gates and luggage areas . In seconds they were swept into the flow of arrivals . Seconds later a trio of uniformed police could be seen breaking through the stream of departing passengers , pushing aside shoulders and small suitcases and plastic garment bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left , and as the police came parallel in the opposite aisle Michael crashed his shoulder into his companion , pummeling him into a blue uniform . " Nyet ! Kishki ! " yelled the Russian . " Goddamn it ! " shouted the police officer as he plunged off balance to his right , tripping one of his associates , who in turn fell on top of an elderly blue-haired woman , who screamed . Havelock accelerated his pace , threading his way past startled passengers who were rushing toward an escalator on the right that led to the baggage area , where they could retrieve their belongings . On the left was someone 's idea of a celestial arch , which led into the central terminal ; he headed toward it , walking faster still as the path became less congested . In the terminal the bright afternoon sunlight streamed through the huge floor-to-ceiling windows . He looked around as he went toward the exit door marked Taxis . There were rows of counters beneath panoplies of white-lettered schedules , isolated slots constantly in motion ; circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the domelike building . Along the walls were banks of telephones and indented racks of telephone books . He veered toward the nearest one . Thirty seconds later he found it : Handelman , J. The address was in tipper Manhattan , on 116th Street , Morningside Heights . Jacob Handelman , halfway man , broker of sanctuary for the pursued and the dispossessed . The man who would conceal Jenna Karas . " Stop over there , " said Havelock , leaning forward in the seat and pointing to a blue canopy emblazoned with a small gold crown and the name THE KING 'S ARMS HOTEL across the scalloped valance . He hoped he would not have to spend the night  --  each hour put greater distance between Jenna and himself  --  but on the other hand , he could not walk around Columbia  | University , carrying even a small suitcase while tracking down Jacob Handelman . He had told the cab driver to take the Triborough Bridge , heading west toward the Hudson and south into Morningside Heights ; he wanted to pass the address on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage . It was midafternoon and the halfway man could be anywhere within the sprawling urban campus . Michael had been to Columbia twice while a graduate student at Princeton , once for a lecture on Europe after Napoleon delivered by a visiting bore from Oxford , and the second time for an inter-graduateschool seminar on university placement for budding Carl Schorskes . Neither occasion was memorable , both were brief , and as a result he really knew nothing about the place . That was probably irrelevant , but the fact that he knew absolutely nothing about Jacob Handelman was not . The King 's Arms was around the corner from Handelman 's apartment . It was one of those small hotels that somehow manage to survive tastefully within the environs of a city university , upper Manhattan 's answer to the old Taft in New Haven or , stretching a point , the Inn at Princeton  --  in essence , a campus fixture , temporary quarters for visiting lecturers rather than an undergraduate drinking spot . It had the appearance of darkleather English comfort and the smell of Academe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel was so close to Handelman 's residence , there was a chance someone might know him . " Certainly , Mr. Hereford , " said the clerk , reading the registration card . " Dr. Handelman stops in now and then  --  a little wine or dinner with friends . A delightful gentleman , a most charming sense of humor . We here , like most everyone else , all call him the Rabbi . " " I did n't know that . His being a rabbi , I mean . " " I 'm not sure he is formally , although I doubt anyone would question his credentials . He 's Jarmaine Professor of Philosophy , and I understand he lectures frequently at the Jewish Theological Seminary . You 'll enjoy your interview . " " I 'm sure I will . Thank you . " " Front , " said the clerk , tapping a bell . Handelman 's apartment building was between Broadway and Riverside Drive , the street sloping toward Riverside Park and the Hudson . It was a solid structure of heavy white stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward mobility  --  which had been permitted to age gently , and to pass through periods of brief renaissance , only to recede into that graveyard of tall , awkwardly ornate edifices too cumbersome for efficient economics . Once there had been a doorman standing in front of the glass-and-ironwork facade ; now there were double locks on the inner door and a functioning communications system between visitor and resident . Havelock pressed the bell , intending merely to make sure Handelman was home ; there was no reply from the speaker . He rang again . Nothing . He went back outside , crossing the street to a doorway , and considered his options . He had telephoned the university 's information center and was given the location and number of Handelman 's office . A second call ? placed anonymously as an administration clerk requesting a Thursday stat sheet  --  revealed the fact that Handelman had doctoral appointments scheduled through 4:0o P.M. It was now nearly five o'clock , and Michael 's frustration was growing . Where was Handelman ? There was , of course , no guarantee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broker of sanctuary who had just placed ? or was placing  --  a woman fugitive from Paris had certain obligations . Havelock had considered going to Handelman 's office or intercepting him on the street ; he considered both options again . Perhaps an appointment had run late , or he had accepted an invitation for dinner ; someone could still be there who might know , who might help him . Coping with the tension of waiting  --  a practice he was normally superb at  --  was causing him pain , actual physical pain in his stomach . He breathed deeply ; he could not confront the halfway man in an office or on the street or in any public place and he knew it . The meeting had to take place where there were names and numbers , maps and codes ; these were the tools of a halfway man . They would only be kept where he could store them safely , reach them quickly . Under a floorboard , or deep in a wall , or microscopically reduced and in the toe of a shoe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of Handelman , but he knew what he looked like . The florid-faced bartender at the King 's Arms Hotel ? himself apparently a fixture , with the flair and verbosity of a fifth-rate poet from Dublin  --  had described " the Rabbi . " Jacob Handelman was a medium-tall man with long white hair and a short gray beard , given slightly to overweight and more than slightly to a paunch . His walk was " slow and stately , " the bartender said , " as if he was the Judaic blood-  | royal , sir , forever partin ' the waters , or mountin ' the ark to discourse with the animals . Ah , but he has a gleam in his eye and a lovely heart , sir . Havelock had listened to the man and ordered a double Scotch . Three minutes past five . Breathe deep . Really breathe and think of Jenna , think what you 're going to say to her . It could be an hour or two , or longer , perhaps half the night . Half the night for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dusk lingered , the orange sun inflaming the New Jersey skyline beyond the Hudson River . The West Side Highway was jammed , and Riverside Drive , parallel to it , was barely less so . The temperature was dropping and gray clouds joined the darkening sky ; snow was in the air . And across the street a medium-tall man , wide at the girth , in a full black overcoat , walked slowly down the pavement . His bearing was indeed stately , matching the distinguished image created by his pure-white hair , which fell several inches below the brim of his black hat . In the light of a streetlamp , Michael could see the gray beard ; it was the halfway man . Jacob Handelman approached the outer glass doors of his apartment building and was now in the stronger light of the large entrance lamps . Havelock stared , at once mesmerized and disturbed ; did he know the halfway man ? Had " the Rabbi " been part of an operation eight . . . ten years ago ? Perhaps in the Middle East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he did know him . Was it the walk ? The deliberate pace that seemed almost anachronistic , as if the figure should be strolling in medieval robes ? Or was it the thin steel-rimmed glasses , set so firmly in the center of the large face ? The moment passed ; it was , of course , possible that a halfway man might have crossed his path in any number of situations . They could have been in the same sector at one time or another , a respected professor supposedly on holiday but , in reality , meeting with someone like Regine Broussac . Entirely possible . Handelman went inside the enclosed entranceway , climbed the inner steps and stopped at the row of mailboxes . It was all Michael could do to restrain himself ; the desire to race across the street and confront the halfway man was nearly overpowering . He may choose to tell you nothing . Broussac . An old man who did not care to negotiate could scream on a staircase and yell for help . And the one who needed help did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , what devices a group of intelligent city dwellers had mounted to defend themselves from hallway thugs . Security alarms had flooded the market ; he had to wait until Jacob Handelman was safely in his flat . And then a knock on the door and the words " Quai d'Orsay " would be enough ; there was respect for a man who could elude alarms , an inherent threat in someone outside a door who knew that the one inside was a halfway man . Handelman would see him ; he could not afford to refuse . The old man disappeared through the inner door , the heavy panel of ironwork and glass swinging slowly shut behind him . Havelock waited three minutes ; the lights went on in several front windows on the fourth floor . It was logical that Handelman 's apartment number was 4A . A halfway man had certain things in common with deep-cover field personnel and the Soviet VKR ; he had to be able to watch the streets . He was not watching now ; there was no figure behind the window shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . Inside the ornate entranceway he struck a match and held it waist-high as he looked down the row of names above the buttons . R. Charles , Superintendent D. He pressed the button and put his lips close to the webbed speaker . " Yes , what is it ? " asked the male voice in clear , well-spoken English . " Mr. Charles ? " said Havelock , not knowing why the man 's voice struck him as odd . " Yes , it 's Charles . Who 's this ? " " United States government , Department of State ? " " What ? " " Nothing to be alarmed about , Mr. Charles . If you 'll come to the door , you can check my identification through the glass , and either admit me or I can give you a number to call . " R. Charles paused , then answered slowly , " Fair enough . " Thirty seconds later a huge , muscular young man appeared in the hallway beyond the door . He was wearing track shorts and a sweatshirt marked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age or the gridiron identity of one of Columbia 's larger linebackers . This , then , was the protection the apartment dwellers on Morningside Heights had chosen . Again , logical : take care of your own to take care of you . Free lodgings for an imposing presence . Michael held up his old ID card in its black plastic case ; the dates , of course , were blurred . K. Charles squinted through the glass , shrugged , and opened the door .  | " What the hell is this ? " he asked , more curiosity than hostility in his voice . A man his size did not have to be aggressive ; his thick legs and neck and muscular arms were sufficiently intimidating . Also his youth . " There 's a man here I 'd like to see on official State Department business , but he 's not in . I rang , of course ; he 's a friend . " " Who is it ? " " Dr. Jacob Handelman . He 's a consultant for us but he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The best , Mr. Charles . However , I think he 'd be alarmed if he thought I might be recognized . " Havelock grinned . " Also , it 's damned cold out there . " " I ca n't let you in his apartment . I wo n't let you in . " " And I would n't allow you to . I 'll just wait here , if it 's all right . " R. Charles hesitated , his eyes dropping to the open ID case still in Michael 's hand . " Yeah , well , okay . I 'd ask you into my place but my roommate and I are busting our humps for a midterm tomorrow . " " Please , I would n't think of it ... " Havelock was interrupted by the appearance of an even larger young man in a doorway at the end of the hall . He was in a full sweatsuit , a book gripped in one hand , a pair of glasses in the other . " Hey , man , what is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Another one ? Come on , we 're wasting time . You 're the brain , I just want to get through tomorrow . " " Your roommate on the team ? " asked Michael , trying to appear contemporary . " No . He wrestles . That is , he does when they do n't throw him out for dirty holds . Okay , Mastiff , coming . " The roommate went inside . " Thanks again . " " Sure . You even sound official . The Rabbi ought to show up any minute . " " Pretty punctual , huh ? " " Like a Swiss clock . " Number 20 turned , then looked back at Havelock . " You know , I figured something like this . Like you , I mean . " " How so ? " " I do n't know . . . the people who come to see him , I guess . Late at night sometimes ; not exactly campus types . " There was nothing to lose in asking , thought Michael . The young man  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the woman , I do n't mind telling you that . For the Rabbi 's sake we hope she got here . Did you by any chance see her ? A blond woman , about five feet five , probably in a raincoat , maybe a hat . Yesterday ? Today ? " " Last night , " said the young man . " I did n't , but Mastiff did . Foxy lady , he told me . But nervous ; she rang the wrong bell and got old Weinberg ? he 's in Four-B and even more nervous . " " We 're relieved she 's here . What time last night ? " " About now , I guess . I was on the phone when Weinberg buzzed us on the intercom . " " Thank you . " Twenty-four hours . A halfway man upstairs . She was within reach  --  he could feel it , sense it ! " Incidentally , by sheer coincidence , you 've been given privileged information . Please respect it . " " Man , you are official . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they institute that draft , I may look you up . " " Do that . Thanks again . " " Take care . " The huge student walked down the hallway to the open door . The instant it was closed , Havelock moved quickly to the wide stone staircase in the center of the foyer , the steps worn smooth , indented from decades of use . He could not use the elevator beyond ; its sound might well alarm a trusting muscular student who could suddenly reject the concept of privileged information in favor of less esoteric responsibilities . In Paris when Michael had purchased the expensive black shoes to match his suit , he had had the presence of mind to have them resoled with hard rubber . They served him well on the staircase ; he went up swiftly , silently , taking the steps two and three at a time , rounding the landings without a sound . In less than half a minute he reached the fourth floor ; apartment 4A was at the end of the tiled , dimly lit hallway . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and pressed the small button embedded in the molding . From beyond he heard the bell chime softly and seconds later the sound of footsteps . " Yes ? " said the curiously high-pitched voice , in a guttural European accent . " Dr. Jacob Handelman ? " " Who is this , please ? " The speech was Jewish-rooted German . " I have news from the Quai d'Orsay . May we talk ? " " Vos ? " The silence was brief , the words that followed rushed . " You are p 300 mistaken . I have no idea what you are talking about . I know no one in ... what you say , the Quai d'Orsay ? " " In that case , I 'll have to get in touch with Paris , and tell my contact she 's made a dreadful error . Naturally , Jacob Handelman will be removed from the catacomb 's computer terminal . " " Just one minute , please . I must jog this old man 's memory . " Havelock could hear the moving footsteps again , faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute was up . The metallic sounds of several locks were heard behind the thick wood ; the door opened and the halfway man stared at him , then gestured with his head for Michael to come inside . What was it ? Why was he so certain he knew this man , this old man with the gray beard and the long white hair ? The large face was soft , but the eyes , in the creased flesh behind the heavy-lensed glasses with the thin steel rims , were ? He was not sure , he could not tell . " You are in my house , sir , " said Handelman , closing the door and manipulating the locks . " I 've traveled widely , of course , not always by my own wishes , like so many thousands in my situation . Perhaps we have a mutual friend I can not at the moment recall . At the Quai d'Orsay . Naturally , I know a number of professors at the Sorbonne . " Was it the high-pitched , singsong voice ? Or the questioning tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , feet planted firmly , the posture soft , yet somehow rigid ? No , it was not any single thing ; it was all of them ... somehow . " A mutual friend ' is n't quite accurate . You know a name . Broussac . Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Section Four . She was to have reached you today ; she 's a person of her word . I think she did . " " Ah , but my office is filled with scores of messages only my secretary is aware of , Mr .... Mr .... ? " " Havelock . " " Yes , Mr. Havellacht . Come in , come in . I knew a Habernicht in Berlin in the old days . Friedrich Habernicht . Quite similar , no ? " " Close , I guess . " Was it the walk ? The same deliberate stride that he had seen outside . The stately ... arrogant steps that should be cloaked in medieval robes , or a high priest 's cassock . He had to ask . " We 've met before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The halfway man 's eyebrows arched ; he adjusted his steelrimmed glasses and peered at Michael . " I can not imagine where . Unless you were a student in a large class of mine , but that would have to he a  | number of years ago , I would think . In such a case , you would remember me , but I would not necessarily remember you . Age and the sheer mass of numbers , you understand . " " Never mind . " A number of years ago . How many years ? " Are you telling me you have n't heard from Broussac ? " " I 'm telling you nothing . . . . Sit down , do sit down . . . . I am merely saying that I do not know . You say this person Broussac sent me a message today , and I am saying I receive dozens of messages every day that I frequently do not get to for many days . Again , age and the sheer mass of numbers . " " I heard you before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning the room . There were bookshelves everywhere , old furniture ? overstuffed chairs , fringed lamps , hassocks  --  nothing Spartan . Once more the smell of Academe . " Jenna Karas ! " said Michael suddenly , rapidly , raising his voice . " Another message ? " asked Handelman ingenuously , an old man bemused by a younger antagonist . " So many messages ? I must have a talk with my secretary . She overprotects me . " " Jenna Karas came to see you last night , I know that ! " " Three . . . no , four people came to see me last night , each a student of mine . I even have their names over here , and the outlines of two graduate papers . " Handelman walked to a cluttered desk against the wall . " Cut it out ! " shouted Havelock . " You packaged her and I 've got to find her ! That was Broussac 's message , " " So many messages , " intoned the halfway man , as if chanting a Talmudic passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate outlines , " continued Handelman , bending over the disorganized pile of papers . " So many visitors . . . so many messages . Who can keep track ? " " Listen to me ! Broussac would n't have given me your name or told me where to find you if I were n't telling you the truth . I have to reach her ! A terrible thing was done to her  --  to us  --  and she does n't understand ! " " " I'he Filioque Denials in the Councils of Arius , ' " chanted Handelmall , standing erect and holding a sheaf of papers under the light of a floor lamp . " Those would be the Nicene rejections of the Eastern Church around the fifth century . Very little understood  --  speaking of understanding . " Ile may choose to tell you nothing . " Goddamn you , where did you send her ? Stop playing with me ! Because  --  if I have to  --  I 'll ? " " Yes ? " Jacob I landelnian turned his head in the spill of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses . He took several steps to his left and replaced the papers on the desk . It was there , at that moment . It was all there . The eyes behind the thin rims of steel , the rigid posture of the soft body . . . the walk . Not the measured gait of a high prelate of the church or of a medieval baron entering a great hall . . . but the strutting of a man in uniform . A black uniform ! Sheets of lightning filled Havelock 's eyes . His mind exploded . . . then and now , now and then ! Not eight or ten years ago but the early years , the terrible years ! He was one of them ! The images of his memory confirmed it ; he saw the man in front of him now as he was then . The large face  --  without a beard , the hair straight and long , not white but Aryan yellow . Walking . . . strutting . . . down to rows of ditches . Machine-gun fire . Screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started toward the halfway man , his hands taut and hard , his fingers curving into claws , tensed for combat with another animal  --  a lower form of animal . " Vos ? " Handelman drew out the sibilant s in his high-pitched whine . " What is the matter with you ? Are you crazy , perhaps ? Look at you ... are you sick ? Stay away from me ! " " The Rabbi ... ? Oh , Christ , you son of a bitch ! You incredible son of a bitch ! What were you  --  Standarten f uhrer ? Sturmbann f uhrer ? ... No , it was Obergruppen f uhrer ! It was you ! Lidice ! " The old man 's eyes widened ; magnified by the thick lenses , they looked monstrous . " You are mad , completely , utterly mad ! Leave my house ! You are not welcome here . With the pain I 've suffered , I will not listen to the ravings of a madman ! " The intense singsong chant of the words covered the halfway man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , to the clutter of papers . Havelock lunged as a gun emerged in Handelman 's hand , placed there minutes ago by an Obergruppenfuhrer who could never afford to forget his origins . The halfway man was a killer of Czechs and Poles and Jews , a man who had taken the identity of a ragged inmate he had sent into a shower of gas or a cave of fire . Havelock grabbed the hand with the gun , jamming his third finger behind the trigger , slamming it repeatedly against the edge of the desk . It would not come loose ! The halfway man was arched beneath him , pinning his right arm , the face grotesque , the mouth stretched like a rabid  | dog 's , the soft body suddenly hard , writhing in spasms . Handelman 's left hand surged up and clapped Michael 's face , the fingers digging into his eyes . Havelock twisted violently back and forth , and the halfway man slipped out from under him . They were at the edge of the desk , immobilized by each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freed his right hand ; he clenched it into a fist and brought it crashing down like a hammer into where he could see the blur of Handelman 's face . The steel-rimmed glasses shattered . The German screamed , and the gun clattered to the floor as he brought both his hands to his face . Havelock leaped backward , yanking the German to his feet , and clamped his hand across the ugly mouth . Havelock 's eyes burned , and tears and specks of blood clouded his vision . But he could see ; the Nazi could not . " You raise your voice , old man , I 'll kill you the instant you do . Now , sit down ! " He pulled the German away from the desk and pushed him into the nearest chair with such force that the halfway man 's neck snapped back . The shattered glasses , however , remained secure on Handelman 's face ; they were a part of that face , part of the ugliness . " You have blinded me ! " whined the soldier from Lidice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forget it ! " said Michael . " I was there ! " " Madness ! " Gasping , Handelman raised his hands to remove his glasses . " Leave them alone ! " ordered Havelock . " Let them stay right where they are . " " Young man , you are ? " " Do n't talk ! Listen . I can put out a trace on a man named Jacob l landelman , going back fifty years . Everything about him ? old pictures , Germans still alive who knew him , if he ever existed . Then circulate a photograph of you . minus the beard , of course , in certain sections of Prague . You were there ; I saw you later and wanted to kill you . A boy of nine or ten wanted to put a knife in your back in the street . And someone still living in Prague or Rudna or Kladno would want to do the same even now . That 's the bottom line , you bastard ! So do n't talk to me about people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was . Where is she ? " " I an ) a very valuable man ? "  | " I 'll bet you are . Who 'd know more about finding safe territories than someone who did it so well . And who could protect himself better than someone who could expose the whereabouts of so many . You 've covered yourself , Murder . But not with me , do you understand that ? Because I do n't care . Now , where is Jenna Karas ? " " While not addressing myself to the preposterous accusations you make , " whined the German , " there are considerations of exchange . " " You have your life , " said Havelock . " I 'm not interested in it . It 's enough that you know I 'm out there and can end it anytime I like . That 's your exchange . Where is she ? " " The top drawer of the desk . " The halfway man gestured with his trembling hand , his eyes unseeing behind the shattered glasses . " Lift up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael went to the desk , opened the drawer , and pulled out the concave receptacle for pens and pencils . There was the light green paper ; he picked it up and unfolded it . It was a page of memorandum stationery from the Columbia University Graduate Faculty of Philosophy . In precise , handwritten block letters was the information Havelock would have killed for ; it was everything . BROUSSAC . APPLICANT FOR DOCTORAL CANDIDATE NAME : ARVIDAS CORESCU . C/O KOHOUTEK RFD 3 , MASON FALLS , PENNA . " Is Corescu the name she 's using ? " asked Havelock sharply . " Temporarily . The papers are only temporary ; they had to be manufactured in a few hours . Others will follow . . . if they are to follow . " " Which means ? " " They must be paid for . Nothing is for nothing . " " Naturally ; the hook 's sunk in and the line keeps reeling out . You must have some very impressive fish out there . " " You could say I have powerful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Kohoutek ? " " A Slav , " said the halfway man , shrugging derisively . " He has farm land . " " When did she leave ? " " She was picked up this morning . " " What 's her cover ? " " Another destitute refugee  --  a niece , perhaps  --  gotten out of the Bal-  | kans , or wherever . Away from the Bear , as they say . Kohoutek will get her work ; he has friends in the textile unions . " " From which she pays him and you , or the papers do n't follow . " " One needs papers , " whined Handelman , " to drive a car , or use a hank ? " " Or to be left alone by immigration , " interrupted Michael . " That threat 's always there , is n't it ? " " We are a nation of laws , sir . " " You make me sick , " said Havelock approaching the chair , looking down at the animal from Lidice . " I could kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added quietly . " Can you understand that , philosopher ? But I wo n't , because I want you to know what it 's like to realize it can happen any moment , any day , any night . With a knock on your door . You live with that , du altes Luder . Heil Hitler . " He turned and started for the door . There was a sharp sound , as of something cracking , behind him . He spun around to see the long blade of a knife streaking toward him directly at his chest . The halfway man had torn the shattered glasses off his face and seized the weapon concealed in the overstuffed chair ; the musty smell of Academe was suddenly the putrid odor of a no-man's-land in a faraway battlefield . Havelock jumped back , but not before the blade had ripped through the jacket of the suit , the razor-sharp edge slitting his flesh and marking his white shirt with a line of blood . Ills right hand whipped under his coat for the Llama automatic . He kicked wildly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the German 's body . As the blade came arcing back he spun away from its trajectory and raised his gun , aiming at the face . I le fired twice ; the halfway man fell to the floor , his head soaked in blood , one eye blown away . A gun had stilled another gun from Lidice . But there was no joy ; it had ceased to matter . There was only Jenna . He had found her ! She could not stop him from rcac ping her now . She might kill him , but first she would have to look into his eyes . That did matter . 1 lc shoved the Llama into his belt , the page of green paper into his pocket , and raced out of the apartment .  | " The name 's Broussac , Mr. President , " said Emory Bradford into the phone at his desk in the State Department . " Madame Regine Broussac . The Quai d'Orsay , Foreign Ministry , Section Four . She contacted the embassy the night before last , instructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of picking up a former American intelligence officer who was to meet her there . Under highly unorthodox circumstances , she said . " " Havelock ? " " She 's admitted that much , yes . " " And ? " " The car drove up and down the streets of Argenteuil all night . It was never contacted . " " What did this Broussac say ? I assume she 's been questioned . " " Angrily . She claims he never showed up . " " Well ? " " Our people think she 's lying . " " Why ? " ? " One of our men went around to her flat and asked some questions . He learned that she returned home by one o'clock in the morning . If that was the case  --  and apparently it was ; two neighbors confirmed it  --  why did n't she phone the embassy and call off the car ? "  | " Has she been asked about this ? " " No , sir . Our people are waiting for instructions . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about officials of the Quai d'Orsay . " Charles Berquist paused , then spoke firmly . " Have Ambassador Richardson call Madame Broussac and respectfully request that she accept an invitation to come to the embassy as soon as it 's convenient , preferably within the hour . A limousine will be sent for her , of course . The President of the United States wishes to speak with her on a confidential basis . " " Mr. President ? " " Just do as I say , Mr. Undersecretary . " " Yes , sir . " " And , Emory ? " " Sir ? " " How 's the other task coming ? The seventy-odd diplomats who may have been out of town during the Spanish problem ? " Bradford paused before answering . When he spoke , it was apparent he was trying to control his voice . " As of this moment , five are miss- " What ? " " I did n't want to say anything until noon , until I have all the information , but the last report indicates that nineteen personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five are n't . " " Get it ! Get all your information ! " " I 'm trying . " " By noon ! Get it ! " The cold rain of the night before had lingered with diminishing strength , and the sky outside the Oval Office was dark . A drop of only a degree or two in temperature and there would be thin , erratic patches of snow on the White House lawn . Berquist stood by the window , briefly wondering how deep the drifts were in Mountain Iron , Minnesota . And how he wished to Christ he were back there now . There was a buzzing from his telephone console . He glanced at his watch as he walked to the desk ; it was eleven-fifteen . " Yes ? " " Your call from Paris , sir . " " ' Thank you . " Berquist pushed the appropriate red button . " Madame linnlssac ? " " ( ) ui , Monsieur le President . It is an honor , sir . I am flattered to have  | been summoned to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , but not without astonishment . And a measure of fear . " And I 'm most grateful , madame . As I instructed , are we alone ? " " Yes , Monsieur le President . Ambassador Richardson most courteously permitted me the use of his office . Quite honestly , I am , as you might say , bewildered . " " You have the word of the President of the United States that we are alone , Madame Broussac . There is no interference on this telephone , no third parties or mechanical devices to record our conversation . Will you accept that word ? " " Assuredly . Why would such an august figure deceive a mere functionary of the Quai d'Orsay ? " " For a lot of reasons . But I 'm not . " " Mais oui . Then I am convinced . " " Good . I need your cooperation in a matter of the utmost importance and delicacy . It in no way affects the government of France , but any help you might give us could only be in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the word of this office . " " It is sufficient , Monsieur le President " " It 's imperative we reach a retired foreign service officer recently separated from the Department of State . His name is Michael Havelock . " " S'il vous plait , Monsieur le ? " " No , please , " interrupted Berquist . " Let me finish . This office has too many staggering concerns to be involved with the work you do , or with the activities Mr. Havelock was engaged in . I only ask you to help us locate him . A destination , a routing , a name he might be using . Whatever you l tell me will be held in the strictest confidence ; no detail will be compromised , or ever used against you or your operations . I promise you that . " " Monsieur ? " " Lastly , " continued the President , overriding her voice , " no matter what he may have told you , his government has never meant him harm . We have too much respect for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tragedy he thinks is his alone is all of ours , and that is all I can tell you , but I hope you consider the source  --  the office from which it comes . Will you help us , help me , Madame Broussac ? " Berquist could hear the breathing over the line from Paris , as well as the pounding tattoo in his own chest . He looked out the window ; fine flecks of white were intermingling with the mottled drizzle . The virgin  | drifts in the fields of Mountain Iron were the most beautiful at sundown ; one caressed them with the eyes , touched the colors from a distance , never wanting them to change . " As you are trying to find him , " began Broussac , " he is looking for someone else . " " We know that . We 've been looking for her too . To save her life . To save his . " The President closed his eyes ; it was a lie he would remember hack in the hills of the Mesabi country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Coventry . Enigma . . . Costa Brava . " There is a man in New York . " " New York ? " Berquist sat forward , startled . " He 's here ? She 's ? ? " " It surprises you , Monsieur le President ? " " Very much . " " It was intended to . It was I who sent her . Sent him . " " This man in New York ? " " He must be approached with a great deal of  --  as you mentioned ? delicacy . He can not be compromised . You have the same such people in I ; urope ; we all need them , Monsieur le President . Even when we know of those who belong to other  --  companies , we leave them alone . " " I understand perfectly . " Berquist did ; the warning was clear . " This man can tell us where he is ? " " He can tell you where she is . That 's what you need to know . But he must be convinced he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man and only he will know . My word . " " Je le respecte . I must tell you , I do not know him , except through his dossier . He is a great man with much compassion , a survivor , monsieur . In April of 1945 , he was taken out of the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany . " 1 le will be accorded all the respect this office can summon , as well as the confidentiality I promised you . His name , please . " " Jacob Handelman . Columbia University . " ' he three men listened intently as Emory Bradford slowly , methodically delivered his findings in the strategy room in the underground complex ? f the White House . Speaking in a deliberate monotone , he described the Tonfinned whereabouts of all nineteen State Department personnel from the fifth floor , L Section , who were not in Washington during the week ? f Costa Brava . When he finished , each man 's expression conveyed both pain and frustration , none more so than the President 's . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face worn and lined , his intelligent eyes angry . " You were so sure this morning , " he said . " You told me five were missing , five not accounted for . What happened ? " " I was wrong , Mr. President . " " Goddamn it , I did n't want to hear that . " " Neither did King Richard when news reached him that Richmond had landed , " said Addison Brooks quietly . " He struck down the messenger . Berquist turned to his ambassador , studying him before replying , " Richard the Third had already received two messages he considered lies . He could have been testing the latest . " Brooks shook his head , admiration in his eyes . " You constantly amaze me , Mr. President . " " I should n't . You worked for Truman . He knew more about history than all the Commagers and Schlesingers put together . I 've done some reading myself , and this is a waste of time . " Berquist turned back to the undersecretary of State . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having surgery . It was an abortion . Her husband 's a lawyer and has been in protracted litigation at The Hague for several months . They 've been apart . The picture was pretty clear . " " How could you even consider a woman ? " demanded Halyard . " No double standard implied , but a woman would leave her mark somewhere . " " Not if she  --  through Moscow  --  controlled men . Actually , I was quite excited when her name surfaced . I thought , Good God , it 's perfect . It was n't . " " Keep it surgery , and tell that to whomever you spoke with . Who were the others ? " " The two attaches at our embassy in Mexico . They 'd been recalled for change-of-policy briefings , then did n't return to Mexico City until January fifth . " " Explanation ? " asked the President . " Furlough time . They went their separate ways and their families joined them . One to a ski lodge in Vermont , the other to the Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " pressed Berquist . " Arthur Pierce . " " Pierce ? " interrupted the general , startled . " The fellow at the U.N . now ? " " Yes , General . "  | " I could have straightened you out there . So could have Addison here . " " So would Matthias , " agreed Bradford . " If there was anyone at State who maintained clear access to Matthias for a longer period of time , I do n't know who it is . He appointed Pierce to the U.N . with the obvious intention of submitting him for the ambassadorship . " " If you 'll permit me the correction , " said Berquist , " I appointed him after Matthias gave him to us and then took him away . He worked over here with the NSC for a couple of months last year before the great man said he was needed in New York . " " And he was one fellow I told the Pentagon to bribe the hell out of , " exclaimed the general . " I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose . He did n't like that mess in Southeast Asia any more than I did , but his record was as good as mine . . . . Let 's face it ; it was a damn sight better . " The ambassador leaned back in his chair . " I know Pierce . He was brought to my attention by an old-line career foreign officer . I suppose I was as responsible as anyone for bringing him into the State Department . Knowing what I do , Iowa farm boy , rather bumble beginnings , I believe , and then a brilliant academic record , everything on scholarship . He was one of the few in this day and age who really went from rags to riches . Well , influential if not literally rich , but he could have been . A dozen or so of the country 's largest corporations were after him , not to mention Rand and the Brookings Institution . I was persuasive and quite practical . Patriotism aside , I pointed out that a tour of duty with the Department of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , he 's still a relatively young man ; with his accomplishments , if he leaves government , he 'll be able to name his own price anywhere . He 's cornstalk American success story  --  how could you possibly conceive of a Moscow connection ? " " I did n't preconceive anything , especially not in this case , " said Bradford . " Arthur Pierce is a friend  --  and I do n't have many . I consider him one of the best men we have at State . But in spite of our friendship , I went by the reports given me . Only me , incidentally . Not to my secretary or any assistant . Only to me . " " What did you get that made you think Pierce could possibly have anything to do with Soviet intelligence ? Christ , he 's mother , God , apple pie and the flag . " " An error in the U.N . message logs . The initial report showed that during the last days of December and the first three days of January ? the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate quer-  | ies from the Middle East Section . Then , of course , they showed up  --  four replies that could be entered in a diplomatic analyst 's handbook . They were as penetrating as anything I 've read on that area and dovetailed with the specific proceedings in the Security Council . As a matter of fact , they were used to block a particularly aggressive Soviet proposal . " " The error in the logs was the explanation ? " said Brooks . " That 's the maddening thing . There 's always an explanation , then a confirmation of an explanation . Message traffic 's so heavy , twenty percent of it gets misplaced . Pierce 's responses had been there all along . " " Who 's the last man ? " Berquist was not going to let up . From his eyes it was apparent he could not readily accept the altered findings . " One I was so convinced might be the mole that I nearly had a White House Secret Service detail pick him up . Thank God I did n't ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nikolai Sitmarin . Born and raised in Leningrad , parents dissident immigrants over a dozen years ago . He 's the State Department 's most accomplished analyst of Soviet internal affairs , proven accurate about seventy percent . He 's a prize , and in his case I thought , What better way for Moscow to put a mole into the ground ? An eighteen-year-old son of immigrants , dissidents permitted a family visa when they were damned hard to come by . " " Is Sitmarin Jewish ? " asked the general . " No , but I expect most people think he is ; in my view it added to his cover . Soviet dissidence is n't the exclusive province of Russian Jews , although that seems to be the general impression . Also , he 's received a fair amount of media exposure  --  the thirty-year-old Wunderkind carrying out a personal vendetta . It all seemed so logically convoluted , so right . " " What were the circumstances ? " The President 's words were clipped . " Again , an unexplained absence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until January eighth . He just was n't in Washington and no assignment was listed for his not being here . I had a time-stat man call the section head ; the explanation was given . " " Which was ? " pressed Berquist . " A personal leave was granted . Sitmarin 's mother was gravely ill in Chicago . " " Pretty damned convenient illness , was n't it ? " " So much so she nearly died . The Cook County General Hospital confirmed it . "  | " But she did n't die , " interrupted Brooks . " I spoke personally to the physician of record and he had a very clear idea of the gravity of my inquiry . He quoted from his files . " " Have them sent to you , " ordered the President . " There are too damned many explanations ; one of them 's a lie . " " I agree , but which one ? " added Bradford . " Not just these five , but the entire nineteen . Someone who thinks he 's  --  or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambiguity from us , hiding the mole . What 's going down as a few extra days ' skiing or going to the Caribbean or shacking up  --  excuse me . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake . Go back and tear into every explanation given you . Find one that wo n't hold up . " " One that has a discrepancy in it , " added the ambassador . " Meetings that did n't take place , a conference that was postponed , credit-card charges where the signatures are questionable  --  a gravely ill woman who just may have been given an assumed name . " " It 'll take time , " said the undersecretary . " You 've accomplished a great deal in something over twelve hours , " continued Brooks sympathetically . " Again , I commend you . " " And you have the authority of this office to get you what you need , anything you need . Use it ! Find the mole ! " Berquist shook his head in exasperation . " He and we are in a race after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach him first , this country has no viable foreign policy . And if Parsifal panics , it wo n't make a damn bit of difference . " The President put his hands on the dais . " Is there anything else ? I 'm keeping two curious senators waiting and it 's no time to do it . They 're on the Foreign Relations Committee and I 've a gut feeling they 've got wind of Matthias . " Berquist stopped ; he got up and looked at Bradford . " Reassure me again  --  that every man at Poole 's Island is secure . " " Yes , sir . Each was screened down to his fingernails , and no one leaves that island for the duration . " " That , too , will run its course , " said Brooks . " What is the duration ? It 's an unnatural condition . " ' These are unnatural circumstances , " broke in General Halyard . " The patrols are armed , the place a fortress . " " Armed ? " The President spoke softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're armed . Insane ! " " What about Havelock ? " asked the statesman . " Has there been any-thing ? "  | " No , " replied the commander in chief , leaving the dais and heading for the door . " Call me later , Mr. Undersecretary , " he said without explanation . " Call me at three o'clock . " The snow , though not heavy , was a whipping snow . It careened off the windshield , tiny white flakes targeting into the glass and bouncing silently away like thousands of miniature asteroids passing through galactic space . Havelock , in his rented car , had driven past the sign several minutes before , the letters reflected in the headlights : MASON FALLS 3 MILES . He had checked out of the King 's Arms Hotel , relieved to see a different clerk on duty , and had taken a cab to LaGuardia Airport . A hastily purchased map pinpointed Mason Falls , Pennsylvania ; his only choice was a domestic flight to Pittsburgh . He was not at the time concerned with further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported his arrival , but even if he had not , LaGuardia was not an interna-tional terminal . No diplomatic personnel came through its gates on overseas flights . He had been issued a last-moment seat on US Air 's 7:56 P.M. plane , reached Pittsburgh by nine-fifteen , and rented a car , the signed credit slip permitting him to drop it off at any Hertz location . By nine-forty-five he was driving south through the long stretches of dark countryside on Route 51 . MASON FALLS ESTABLISHED 1858 Through the swirling pockets of snow  --  thicker now , fuller  --  Michael could see the glow of a red neon sign up ahead on the right . He approached , slowing down , and read the letters ; a touch of the absurd had intruded : HARRY 'S BAR . Either someone along the banks of the Monongahela had a sense of humor , or there was a man named Harry who did not know how far away he was from Venice or Paris . Or perhaps he did . He obviously did . Inside , there were enlarged World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several showing a soldier standing outside the door of Paris 's Harry 's Bar on the Right Bank . The place was rustic  --  thick wood dulled by use and totally untouched by furniture polish  --  heavy glasses and high-backed barstools . A jukebox in the corner was bleating out country music to the bored half-dozen or so patrons at the bar . They were in keeping with their surroundings : everyone male , a profusion of red-checkered flannel shirts , wide-ribbed cordu-  | roy trousers and ankle-length boots worn in the fields and in barns . These were farmers and farmhands ; he might have assumed as much from the pickup trucks outside , but the biting wind had distracted him  --  that and the fact that he was in Mason Falls , Pennsylvania . He looked around for a wall telephone ; it was inappropriately placed six feet from the jukebox . That did not concern him , but the absence of a telephone book did ; he needed an address . There had been no time at LaGuardia to find the correct book for Mason Falls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the terminal as fast as possible . He walked to the bar , stood between two empty stools , and waited for an aging , morose-looking Harry to serve him . " Yeah , what 'll it be ? " " Scotch on the rocks , and a telephone book , if you 've got one , please . " The owner studied Havelock briefly . " I do n't get much call for Scotch . It ai n't the best . " " I probably would n't know the best . " " It 's your throat . " Harry reached under the bar to his right , but instead of coming up with a glass and ice , he put a thin telephone book in front of Michael . He then walked to his left , to a row of bottles on a lighted shelf . Havelock leafed through the pages rapidly , his index finger descending the row of K 's . Kohoutek , Janos RFD 3 Box 12 Goddamn it ! Rural Free Delivery , routing number 3 , could be anywhere in Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large in square mileage . Acres and acres of farmland , winding roads that threaded through the countryside . And to call the number was to give an alarm ; if there were special words , he did not know them , and all things considered , there undoubtedly were special words . To mention Jacob Handelman over the phone was asking for a confirmation call to be made to New York . There would be no answer on the dead halfway man 's phone until he was found , possibly in the morning , possibly not for several days . " Here y'are , " said Harry , placing the drink on the bar . " Would you know a man named Kohoutek ? " asked Havelock softly . " Janos Kohoutek ? " The owner squinted in minor thought . " Know the name , not him , t hough . I le 's one of them foreigners with some land over in the west end . " " Would you know where in the west end ? "  | " No . Does n't it tell you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It only gives an RFD and a box number . " " Call him , for Christ 's sake . " " I 'd rather not . As you say , he 's a foreigner ; he might not understand over the phone . " " Hey ! " yelled Harry over the sounds of the country music . " Any you assholes know a guy named Kohoutek ? " " Foreigner , " said one red-checkered flannel shirt . " He 's got more'n forty acres over west , " added a hunting cap farther down . " Fuckin ' refugees with their government handouts can afford it . We ca n't . " " Would you know where ? " asked Havelock . " It 's either on Chamberlain or Youngfield , maybe Fourforks , I do n't know which . Do n't it say in the book ? " " No , just RFD-three , that 's all . And a box number . " " Route three , " said another patron , this one with a growth of beard and bleary eyes . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that son of a bitch soaks ' em . Got the job through his uncle , the fuckin ' grafter . " " Would you know where the route is ? " " Sure . Fourforks Pike . Heads due west from the depot a mile down Fifty-one . " " Thanks very much . " Michael raised the glass to his lips and drank . It was not very good ; it was not even Scotch . He reached into his pocket , pulled out his money , and left two dollars on the bar . " Thanks again , " he said to the owner . " It 's sixty cents , " said Harry . " For old times ' sake , " replied Havelock . " For the other place in Paris . " " Hey , you been there ? " " Once or twice . " " You shoulda told me ! You woulda gotten decent whisky ! Let me tell you , in ' 45 me and ? " " I 'm really sorry , I do n't have time . " Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He did not see a man at the far end of the room get off his stool and walk to the telephone . Fourforks Pike became a slowly curving , interminable backcountry road less than a mile west of the old railroad depot . The first post-office box was marked 5 ; prominently anchored in the ground on his right , it was clearly visible through the snow in the glare of the headlights . The next ,  | however , Havelock would have missed had he not suddenly become aware of a break in the foliage ; it was a narrow dirt road on his left , and the box could not be seen from the pike . It was number 7 , negating the rule that said odd and even numbers meant different sides in a delivery route . He would have to drive more slowly and keep his eyes more alert . The next three boxes were all within a half mile , each in sequence , the last number 1o . Two hundred yards beyond , the road split  --  the first of presumably four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fork on the right . Number 11 did not appear until he had driven nearly a mile and a half ; when he saw it he briefly closed his eyes in relief . For several agonizing moments he had been convinced he had taken the wrong road . He pressed his foot on the accelerator , his mouth dry , the muscles of his face rigid , his eyes straining . If the road was interminable  --  made worse by the spiraling snow against the windshield  --  the wait for the final sighting was torturously so . He entered a long , seemingly endless stretch of flat , straight ground , which , as near as he could determine , was bordered by fields or pastures ; but there were no houses , no lights anywhere . Had he passed it ? Was his vision so distorted by the silent pounding of the snow that the post-office box had gone by without his spotting it ? Was there an unseen road on his right or his left , a metal receptacle off the shoulder , covered perhaps ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet heavy , and the wind was too strong for the snow to settle . It was there ! On the right . A large black mailbox , shaped like a miniature Quonset hut , the covered opening wide enough to receive small packages . The number 12 was stenciled in white  --  thick white enamel that threw back the light as though challenged in the darkness . Havelock slowed down and peered through the window ; again there were no lights beyond , no signs of life whatsoever . There was only what appeared to be a long road that disappeared into a wall of trees and further darkness . He drove on , eyes straining , looking for something else , something he could not miss if and when he came across it . He only hoped it would be soon , and several hundred yards beyond box number 12 , he found a reasonable facsimile . Not ideal but , with the snow , acceptable . It was a bank of wild foliage that had crept toward the edge of the road , the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever it was , it would do . 1 le drove the car off the shoulder and into the cluster of bushes and high grass . I is extinguished the headlights and opened his suitcase in the front scat . I lc removed all identification and shoved it into the elasticized  | rear pocket , then took out a heavy leaded plastic bag impervious to X-rays , the kind often used for transporting exposed film . He peeled it open and removed the Llama automatic ; the magazine was full . Last , he reached into the suitcase for the scaling knife he had used at Col des Moulinets ; it was sheathed in a thin leather scabbard with a clip . Awkwardly he pulled up the sides of his topcoat and shoved it behind his trousers into the small of his back , clipping it to his belt at the base of his spine . He hoped neither weapon would be called for ; words were infinitely preferable , frequently more effective . He got out of the car , locked it , pushed the snow-swept foliage up around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourforks Pike toward P.O. Box 12 , RFD 3 , Mason Falls , Pennsylvania . He had walked no more than thirty feet off the highway into the long , narrow road that seemed to disappear into a wall of darkness beyond when he stopped . Whether it was the years he had spent instinctively studying alien ground  --  aware that an unknown path at night might hold lethal surprises  --  or the wind off the fields that caused him to angle his head downward against it , he could not tell . He was merely grateful that he saw it : a tiny greenish dot of light on his right about two feet above the snow-patched earth . It appeared to be suspended , but he knew it was n't . Instead , it was wired to the end of a thin black metal tube that was sunk at least another two feet into the ground for stability . It was a photoelectric cell , its counterpart across the road , an invisible beam of light crossing the darkness , connecting both terminals . Anything breaking that beam for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fifty pounds would trigger an alarm somewhere . Small animals could not do it ; automobiles and human beings could not fail to do it . Michael sidestepped cautiously to his right through the cold , wet overgrowth to pass beyond the device . He stopped again at the edge of the tangled bushes , aware of a line of flickering white parallel with his shoulders , knowing suddenly that there was another obstacle . It was a barbedwire fence bordering an adjacent field , flakes of snow clinging briefly to the barbs before being whipped away . He had not seen it entering the side road marked by post-office box number 12 ; he looked back and understood . The fence did not begin until the foliage was high enough to conceal it . And that meant he understood something else ; again , weight density . Sufficient pressure against the thinly spaced wires would set off further alarms . Janos Kohoutek was very security-conscious . Considering his location , he had paid for the best he could get .  | This , then , was the path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder-high barbed-wire fence . For if there was one photoelectric alarm , there were others along the way because the expectation of malfunction was an innate part of protection technology . He wondered how long " the way " was ; he could see virtually nothing but foliage and darkness and swirling snow in front of him . He started to literally push ahead , bending the tangled brush and webbed branches with his hands and arms , as he kept his eyes riveted on the ground for dots of eerie green light . He passed three , then four , each spaced roughly two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet apart . He reached the wall of tall trees , the fence growing higher as if commanded by nature . He was soaked now , his face cold , his brows iced , but movement was easier through the thick-trunked trees that seemingly had been planted at random but nevertheless formed a visual wall . Suddenly he realized he was heading downward , descending . He looked over at the road ; the decline there was sharper , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a break in the trees ; the narrow , sloping path he had to take was still overgrown , the high grass and untamed bushes bending in the wind and glazed with white . And then spread below him was a sight that both hypnotized and disturbed him , in the same way he had reacted to the first sight of Jacob h landelman . He plunged down through the thickets of brush , falling twice into the cold , prickly bushes , his eyes on the bewildering view below . At first glance it was like any farm buried in the deeper countryside , protected in the front by sloping fields , endless woods beyond . There was a group of buildings , solid , simple , constructed of heavy wood for severe winters , the lights in various windows flickering in the snowfall : a main house and several barns , a silo , tool sheds and shelters for tractors and plows and harvesting equipment . They were indeed what they seemed to he , Havelock was sure , but he knew they were more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the sloping road . It was framed unpretentiously with iron piping ; the mesh was ordinary mesh , but it was higher than it had to be , higher than it should be for the entrance to a farm . Not higher to a conspicuous degree , but simply higher than seemed necessary , as if the builder had made a slight error in the height specification and had decided to live with the mistake . Then there was the fence that spanned out from both sides of the unprepossessing gate ; it , too , was strange , somehow askew , also higher than it had to be for the purpose of containing animals in the ascending grazing fields before it . Was it just  | the height ? It was no more than seven feet , Michael judged as he drew closer ; it had appeared much shorter from above  --  again nothing strange ... but somehow wrong . And then he realized what it was , why the word " askew " had come to mind . The top of the barbed-wire fence was angled inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking in , it was designed to keep people from breaking out ! Suddenly the blinding beam of a searchlight shot out from the upper regions of the silo ; it was arcing around  --  toward him . This was the 198os , but he was standing in front of a symbol of human carnage that went back forty years . It was a concentration camp ! " We wondered how long it would take you , " said a voice behind him . He spun around , reaching for his weapon . It was too late . Powerful arms gripped him around the neck , arching him backwards , as a pair of hands plunged a soft , wet , acrid-smelling cloth into his face . The beam of the searchlight zeroed in on him . He could see it , feel it , as his nostrils began to burn . Then the darkness came , and he could neither see nor feel .  | He felt the warmth first ; he found it not particularly pleasant but merely different from the cold . When he opened his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously became aware of the nausea in his throat and the stinging sensation on his face . The pungent odor lingered in his nostrils ; he had been anesthetized with pure ethyl ether . He saw flames , logs burning behind a black-bordered screen , in a large brick fireplace . He was on the floor in front of the slate hearth ; his topcoat had been removed , and his wet clothes were heating up uncomfortably . But part of the discomfort was in the small of his back ; the scaling knife was still in place , the leather scabbard irritating his skin . He was grateful for the pain . He rolled over slowly , inch by inch , his eyes half closed , observing what he could by the light of the fire and several table lamps . He heard the sound of muffled voices ; two men were talking quietly beyond a plain brown sofa at the other end of the room ; they stood together in a hallway . They had not noticed his movement , but they were his guards . The room itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , functional furniture , thick plaited rag rugs scattered about over a wide-beamed floor ,  | windows bordered by red-checkered curtains that might have come from a Sears Roebuck catalogue . It was a simple living room in a country farmhouse , nothing more or less , and nothing suggesting it might be something else  --  or someplace else  --  to disturb a visitor 's eye . If anything , the room was Spartan , without a woman 's touch , entirely male . Michael slid his watch slowly into view . It was one o'clock in the morning ; he had been unconscious for nearly forty-five minutes . " Hey , he 's awake ! " cried one of the men . " Get Mr. Kohoutek , " said the other , walking across the room toward Havelock . He rounded the sofa and reached under his leather jacket to pull out a gun . He smiled ; the weapon was the Spanish Llama automatic that had traveled from a mist-laden pier in Civitavecchia , through the Palatine and Col des Moulinets , to Mason Falls , Pennsylvania . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen one like it in years . Thanks a lot . " Michael was about to answer , but was interrupted by the rapid , heavyfooted entrance of a man who walked out of the hallway carrying a glass of steaming liquid in his hand . " You are very free with odds and ends , " thundered Janos Kohoutek . " Be careful or you 'll walk barefoot in the snow . " Nie shodz sniegu bez butow . Kohoutek 's accent was that of the dialect of the Carpathian Mountains south of Otrokovice . The words alluding to bare feet in the snow were part of the Czech-Moravian admonition to wastrels who did not earn their keep or their clothes . To understand the cold , walk barefoot in the snow . Kohoutek came around the guard and was now fully in view . He was a bull of a man , his open shirt emphasizing the thickness of his neck and chest , the stretched cloth marking the breadth of his heavy shoulders ; age had not touched his physique . He was not tall , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was in his face  --  more jowl than face ? deeply lined , eyes deeply set , the flesh worn by well over sixty years of driven living . The hot , dark brown liquid in the glass was tea  --  black Carpathian tea . The man holding it was Czech by birth , Moravian by conviction . " So here is our invader ! " he roared , staring down at Havelock . " A man with a gun , but with no identification  --  not even a driver 's license or credit card , or a billfold to carry such things in  --  attacks my farm like a corn-  | mando ! Who is this stalker in the night ? What is his business ? His name ? " " Havlieek , " said Michael in a low , sullen voice , pronouncing the name in an accent close to Moravian . " Mikhail Havlieek . " " Cesky ? " " Ano . " " Obchodni ? " shouted Kohoutek , asking Havelock his business . " Ma zena , " replied Michael , answering " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aging bull . " The one who was brought here this morning , " said Havelock , continuing in Czech . " Two were brought in this morning ! Which ? " " Blond hair . . . when we last saw her . " Kohoutek grinned , but not with amusement . " Chlipny , " he said , leering . " Her body does n't interest me , the information she has does . " Michael raised himself . " May I get up ? " " Vddnim pripade ! " The mountain bull roared again as he rushed forward , lashing his right foot out , the boot catching Havelock in the throat , making reel him back on the slate hearth . " Proklate ! " shouted Havelock , grabbing his neck . It was the moment to react in anger , the beginning of the words that mattered . " I paid ! " he yelled in Czech . " What do you think you 're doing ! " " You paid what ? To ask about me on the highway ? To sneak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To carry a gun into my farm ? I 'll pay you ! " " I did what I was told ! " " By whom ? " " Jacob Handelman . " " Handelman ? " Kohoutek 's full , battered face was stretched into an expression of bewilderment . " You paid Handelman ? He sent you ? " " He told me he would phone you , get in touch with you , " said Michael quickly , using a truth from Paris that the halfway man had denied in New York , denied for profit . " I was n't to call you under any circumstances . I was to leave my car on the highway past your mailbox and walk down the road to your farm . " " The highway ? You asked questions about me in a cafe on the high-way ! "  | " I did n't know where the Fourforks Pike was . How could I ? Did you have a man there ? Did he call you ? " The Czech-Moravian shook his head . " It does n't matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sometimes . " Kohoutek stopped ; the menace returned to his eyes . " But you did not walk down my road . You came in like a thief , an armed thief ! " " I 'm no fool , priteli . I know what you have here and I looked for trip alarms . I was with the Podzemi . I found them and so I was cautious ; I wanted no dogs on me or men shooting at me . Why do you think it took me so long to get here from that cafe on the highway ? " " You paid Handelman ? " " Very handsomely . May I get up ? " " Get up ! Sit , sit ! " ordered the mountain bull , pointing to a short deacon 's bench to the left of the fireplace , his expression more bewildered than seconds before . " You gave him money ? " " A great deal . He said I 'd reach a point in the road when I could see the farm below . Someone would be waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight . There was nobody I could see , no one at the gate . But then the weather 's rotten , so I came down . " Gripping his steaming glass of tea , Kohoutek turned and walked across the room to a table against the wall . There was a telephone on it ; he put down the glass , picked up the phone , and dialed . " If you 're calling Handelman ? " " I do not call Handelman , " the Czech-Moravian broke in . " I never call Handelman . I call a man who calls another ; he phones the German . " " You mean the Rabbi ? " Kohoutek raised his head and looked at Havelock . " Yes , the Rabbi , " he said without comment . " Well , whoever . . . there wo n't be any answer at his apartment . That 's all I wanted to tell you . " " Why not ? " " He told me he was on his way to Boston . He 's lecturing at someplace called Brandese or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull , then talked into the phone : " This is Janos . Call New York . The name you will give is Havlicek , have you got that ? Havlicek . I want an explanation . " He hung up , grabbed his tea , and started back toward the fireplace . " Put that away ! " he commanded the guard in the leather jacket who was rubbing the Llama against his sleeve . " Stand in the hall . " The man walked away as Kohoutek approached the  | fire , sitting down opposite Michael in a rustic-looking rocking chair . " Now we wait , Mikhail Havlicek . It wo n't be long , a few minutes , ten  --  fifteen perhaps . " " I ca n't be responsible if he 's not home , " said Havelock , shrugging . " I would n't be here if we did n't have an agreement . I would n't know your name or where to find you if he had n't told me . How could I ? " " We 'll see . " " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several buildings , " answered the man from the Carpathians as he sipped his tea and rocked slowly back and forth . " She 's upset , of course . It is not quite what she expected , but she will understand ; they all do . We are their only hope . " " How upset ? " Kohoutek squinted . " You are interested ? " " Only professionally . I 've got to take her out and I do n't want trouble . " " We shall see . " " Is she all right ? " asked Michael , controlling his anxiety . " Like some others  --  the educated ones  --  she lost her reason for a while . " Kohoutek grinned , then coughed an ugly laugh as he drank his tea . " We explained the regulations , and she told us they were not acceptable . Can you imagine ? Not acceptable ! " The bull roared , then his voice dropped . " She will be watched carefully , and before she is sent outside she will understand . As they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm taking her . " " You say that . " " I paid . " Kohoutek leaned forward , stopping the motion of the chair . " How much ? " It was the question the Czech-Moravian had wanted to ask several minutes ago , but Carpathian progress was serpentine . Michael knew he was on a tightrope ; there would be no answer in New York . He was about to negotiate , and both men knew it . " Would n't you rather hear it from Handelman ? If he 's home . " " Perhaps I would rather hear it from you , priteli . " " How do you know you can trust me ? " " How do I know I can trust the Rabbi ? How do you know you can trust hint ? " " Why should n't I ? I found you , found this place . Not in the way I would have preferred , but I 'm here . "  | " You must represent influential interests , " said Kohoutek , veering quickly , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't carry identification . But then you know that . " The aging lion began rocking again . " Such influence , however , always carries money . " Enough . " " How much did you pay Handelman ? " All movement stopped as the question was asked . " Twenty thousand dollars American . " " Twenty . . . ? " Kohoutek 's weathered face lost some of its color and his deep-set eyes squinted through the slits of flesh . " A considerable sum , priteli . " " He said it was reasonable . " Havelock crossed his legs , his damp trousers warmed by the fire . " We were prepared for it . " " Are you prepared to learn why he did not reach me ? " " With the complicated arrangements you have for contacting one another , I 'm not surprised . He was on his way to Boston , and if someone was not by a phone ? " " Someone is always by a phone ; he is a cripple . And you were on your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michael uncrossed his legs , his eyes riveted on Kohoutek . " The trip lights ? " " You spoke of dogs ; we have dogs . They only attack on command , but an intruder does not know that . They circle him , barking viciously . What would you have done ? " " Used my gun , of course . " " And for that you would have been shot . " Both men were silent . Finally , Havelock spoke . " And the Rabbi has twenty thousand dollars you do n't know about and I ca n't tell you because I 'm dead . " " Now you see . " " He 'd do that to you  --  for twenty thousand dollars ? " The mountain bull again started to rock his chair . " There could be other considerations . I 've had minor troubles here  --  nothing we can not control  --  but this is a depressed area . Certain jealousies arise when you have a successful farm . Handelman might care to replace me , have a reason to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would have a corpse on my hands , a corpse who might have made  | a telephone call while he was alive . He could have told someone where he was going . " " You shot an intruder , a man with a gun , who probably used his gun . You were defending your property , no one would blame you . " " No one , " agreed Kohoutek , still rocking . " But it would be enough . The Moravian is a troublemaker , we can not afford him . Cut him off . " " From what ? " The mountain man sipped his tea . " You spent twenty thousand dollars . Are you prepared to pay more ? " " I might be persuaded . We want the woman ; she 's worked with our enemies . " " Who is we ' ? " " That I wo n't tell you . It would n't mean anything to you if I did . ... Cut you off from what ? " Kohoutek shrugged his heavy shoulders . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corescu woman . " " That 's not her name . " " I 'm certain it 's not , but that 's no concern of mine . Like the others , she 'll be pacified , work out of here for a month or two , then be sent elsewhere . The South , Southwest  --  the northern Midwest , wherever we place her . " The bull grinned . " The papers are always about to arrive ? just another month , one more congressman to pay , a senator to reach . After a while , they 're like goats . " " Even goats can rebel . " " To what end ? Their own ? To be sent back to the place where they came from ? To a firing squad , or a gulag , or garrote in an alleyway ? You must understand , these are panicked people . It 's a fantastic busi-ness ! " " Do the papers ever arrive ? " " Oh , yes , frequently . Especially for the talented , the productive . The payments go on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks . Someone who refuses , someone who threatens you with exposure . " " Then we provide another paper , pYiteli . A death certificate . " " My turn to ask . Who is we ' ? " " My turn to answer . I will not tell you . " " But the Rabbi wants to cut you out of this fantastic business . " " It 's possible . " The telephone rang , its bell abrasive . Kohoutek got out of the rocking chair and walked rapidly across the room . " Perhaps we shall  | learn now , " he said , placing his tea on the table , and picking up the phone in the middle of the second bell . " Yes ? " Havelock involuntarily held his breath ; there were so many probabilities . A curious university athlete whose responsibility was the well-being of his tenants , who might have walked out into the hallway . A graduate student with an appointment . So many accidents .. . " Keep trying , " said the Carpathian . Michael breathed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . " There is no answer on Handelman 's phone . " " He 's in Boston . " " How much could you be persuaded to pay ? " " I do n't carry large sums with me , " replied Havelock , estimating the amount of cash in his suitcase . It was close to six thousand dollars  --  money he had taken out of Paris . " You had twenty large sums for the Rabbi . " " It was prearranged . I could give you a down payment . Five thousand . " " Down payment on what ? " " I 'll be frank , " said Michael , leaning forward on the deacon 's bench . " The woman 's worth thirty-five thousand to us ; that was the sum allocated . I 've spent twenty . " " With five , that leaves ten , " said the bull . " It 's in New York . You can have it tomorrow , but I 've got to see the woman tonight . I 've got to take her tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars ? " " Why should I do that ? It 's a budget item and I do n't concern myself with finances . Also , I suspect you can collect a fair amount from Handelman . A thief caught stealing from a thief . You 've got him now ; you could cut him out . " Kohoutek laughed his bull of a laugh . " You are from the mountains , Cechu ! But what guarantees do I have ? " " Send your best man with us . I have no gun ; tell him to keep his at my head . " " Through an airport ? I am not a goat ! " " We 'll drive . " " Why tonight ? " " They expect her in the early morning . I 'm to bring her to a man at the corner of Sixty-second Street and York Avenue , at the entrance of the East River Drive . He has the remaining money . He 's to take her to Kennedy Airport , where arrangements have been made on an Aeroflot  | Cech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you trust your best man ? " " I am the best . Suppose it was me ? " " Why not ? " " Done ! We shall travel together , the woman in the back seat with me . One gun at her head , the other at yours . Two guns , ? riteli ! Where is the five thousand dollars ? " " In my car up on the road . Send someone with me , but I get it myself ; he stays outside . That 's the condition or we have no negotiation . " " You Communists are all so suspicious . " " We learned it in the mountains . " " Cechu ! " " Where 's the woman ? " " In a back building . She refused to eat before , threw the tray at our Cuban . But then , she 's educated ; it is not always a favorable thing , although it brings a higher price later . First , she must be broken ; perhaps the Cuban has already begun . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her type of woman is his favorite . " Michael smiled ; it was the most difficult smile he had rendered in his life . " Are the rooms wired ? " " What for ? Where are they going ? What plans can they hatch alone ? Besides , to install and service such items could raise gossip . ' The alarms on the road are enough trouble ; a man comes from Cleveland to look after them . " " I want to see her . Then I want to get out of here . " " Why not ? When I see five thousand dollars . " Kohoutek stopped rocking and turned to his left , shouting in English . " You ! Take our guest up in the truck to his automobile . Have him drive and keep your gun on his head ! " Sixteen minutes later , Havelock counted out the money into the Moravian 's hands . " Go to the woman , priteli , " said Kohoutek . I le walked across the fenced-in compound to the left of the silo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , to your right , " said the guard . There was a barn at the edge of the woods , but it was more than a barn . flight . Your man can make sure ; she does n't get into the car until the money is paid . What more do you want ? " Kohoutek rocked , his squint returning . " The Rabbi is a thief . Is the  | There were lights in several windows above the ground level ; it was a second floor . And silhouetted in those lights were straight black lines ; they were bars . Whoever was behind those windows could not get out . It was a barracks . Ein Konzentrationslager . Michael could feel the welcome pressure of the leather scabbard at the base of his spine ; the scaling knife was still in place . He knew he could take the guard and the Llama  --  a slip in the snow , a skid over iced grass and the man in the leather jacket was a dead man  --  but not yet . It would come later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could convince her . And if he could not , both of them would die . One losing his life , the other in a hell that would kill her . Listen to me ! Listen to me , for we are all that 's left of sanity ! What happened to us ? What did they do to us ? " Knock on the door , " said the man behind . Havelock rapped on the wood . A voice with a Latin accent answered . " Yes ? What is it ? " " Open up , Mr. K 's orders . This is Ryan . Hurry ! " The door was opened two or three inches by a stocky man in a bolero and dungarees . He stared first at Michael , then saw the guard and opened the door completely . " Nobody called , " he said . " We thought you might be busy , " said the man behind Havelock , a snide laugh in his voice . " With what ? Two pigs and a crazy woman ? " " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " He better have a gene made like rock , I tell you no lie ! I looked in ten minutes ago ; she 's asleep . I do n't think she slept for a couple of days maybe . " " Then he can jump her , " said the guard , pushing Michael through the door . They climbed the stairs and entered a narrow corridor with doors on both sides . Steel doors with slits in the center , sliding panels for peering inside . We are in our movable prison . Where was it ? Prague ? Trieste ? . . Barcelona ? " She 's in this room , " said the Latin , stopping at the third door . " You want to look ? " " Just open the door , " said Havelock . " And wait downstairs . " " Ojald ? "  | " Mr. K 's orders , " broke in the leather-jacketed guard . " Do what the man says . The Cuban took a key from his belt , unlocked the cell door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Michael . The two men walked up the corridor . Havelock opened the door . The small room was dark , and the dark light of night grudgingly spilled through the window , the white flakes bouncing off the glass and the bars . He could see her on the bed , more cot than bed . Fully dressed , she was lying face down , her blond hair cascading over her shoulders , one arm hanging down limp , the hand touching the floor . She lay on top of the covers , her clothes disheveled , the position of her body and the sound of her deep breathing proof of exhaustion . Watching her , he ached , pain pressing his chest for the pain she had endured , so much of it because of him . Trust had fled , instincts rejected , love repulsed ; he had been no less an animal than the animals who had done this to her . . . he was ashamed . And filled with love . He could see the outline of a floor lamp next to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cold fear went through him and his throat tightened . He had faced risks before , but never a danger like this , never a moment that meant so much to him . If he lost it  --  lost her , the bond between them shattered irremediably  --  nothing would matter except the death of liars . He was profoundly aware that he would willingly give up years of life for the moment to be frozen , not to have to turn on the light ? simply to call out her name softly , as he had called it a hundred times a hundred , and have her hand fall into his , her face come against his . But the waiting , too , was self-inflicted torture ; what were the words ? Between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion , all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream . It would end or it would begin when he turned on the lamp . He walked silently to the bed . An arm shot up in the darkness . Pale skin flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdomen . He felt the impact of a sharp pointed object  --  not a knife , something else . He leaped back and grabbed the hand , twisting yet not twisting  --  to cause her further pain was not in him . I le could not hurt her . She 'll kill you if she can . Broussac . Jenna rolled off the bed , her left leg bent , her knee crashing into his kidney , her sharp fingernails clawing his neck , digging into his skin . He  | could not strike her , he could not do it . She grabbed his hair , pulling his face down , and her right knee smashed into the bridge of his nose . The darkness was splintered into fragments of white light . " Cunei " she cried in a muted voice , made guttural by her fury . He understood ; he had taught her well . Use an enemy . Kill him only if you must . But use him first . Escape was her intent ; it accounted for the disheveled clothes , the skirt pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhaustion , but he had been wrong ; it was a sight for a prase peering through a slot in the cell door . " Std j ! " he whispered harshly as he held her , twisting nothing , damaging nothing . " Tesi me ! " He freed his left hand and pulled her writhing body across the small room to the lamp . He reached over and found the switch ; he snapped it on , her face in front of his . She stared at him , her wide brown eyes bursting from their sockets with that strange admixture of fear and loathing he had seen in the window of the small plane in Col des Moulinets . The cry that was wrenched from her throat came also from the center of her life ; the scream that grew from it was prolonged and horrible  --  a child in a cellar of terror , a woman who faced the return of infinite pain . She kicked wildly , and spun away , breaking his grip , and threw herself across the bed and against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madly , a crazed animal cornered , with nothing left but to end its life screaming , clawing , thrashing as the trap snapped shut . In her hand she grasped the instrument that had been her only hope for freedom ; it was a fork , its tines tinted with his blood . " Listen to me ! " he whispered sharply again . " It was done to both of us ! It 's what I 've come to tell you , what I tried to tell you at Col des Moulinets ! " " It was done to me ! You tried to kill me . . . how many times ? If I 'm to die , then you ? " He lunged , and pinning her hand against the wall , her right arm under his , he forced her to stop writhing . " Broussac believed you . . . but then she believed me ! Try to understand . She knew I told her the truth ! " " You do n't know the truth ! Liar , liar ! " She spat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nails of her trapped hand into his back . " They wanted me out and you were the way ! I do n't know why , but I know men have been killed . . . a woman , too , who was meant to be you ! They want to kill us both now , they have to ! " " Liar ! "  | " There are liars , yes , but I 'm not one of them ! " " You are , you are ! You sold yourself to the zv rata ! Kurva ! " " No ! " He twisted her hand , the bloodied fork protruding from her clenched fist . She winced in pain as he pulled her wrist down . Then she slowly reduced her counterpressure , her wide eyes frightened still , hating still , but piercing , too , with confusion . He placed the fork against his throat and whispered . " You know what to do , " he said carefully , clearly . " The windpipe . Once punctured there 's no way out for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretend to go along with them ; be passive , but watch the guard  --  as you know , he 's a goat . The sooner you 're cooperative , the sooner they 'll find you work on the outside . Remember , all you want are your papers ; they 're everything to you . But when they let you out , somehow get to a phone and reach Broussac in Paris  --  you can do it . She 'll help you because she knows the truth . " He stopped and took his hand away , leaving hers free . " Now , do it . Either kill me or believe me . " Her stare was to him a scream echoing in the dark regions of his mind and hurling him into the horror of a thousand memories . Her lips trembled , and slowly it happened . Fear and bewilderment remained in her eyes , but the hatred was receding . Then the tears came , welling up slowly ; t hey were the balm that meant the healing could begin . Jenna dropped her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fork fell from her unclenched hand , and her body went limp , as the deep , terrible sobs came . He held her . It was all he could do , all he wanted to do . The sobs subsided and the minutes went by in silence . All they could hear was their own breathing , all they felt was each other as they clung together . Finally he whispered , " We 're getting out , but it wo n't be clean . Did you meet Kohoutek ? " " Yes , a horrible man . " " He 's going with us , supposedly to pick up a final payment for you . " " But there is n't any , " said Jenna , pulling her face back , studying his , her eyes absorbing him , enveloping him . " Let me look at you , just look at you . " " There is n't time ? " ' : Shhh . " She placed her fingers on his lips . " There must be time , because there 's nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking over here , and when I was looking down at you . " He smiled as he stroked her hair and gently caressed her lovely face . " You played well , prevkrdsne " " I 've hurt you . "  | " A minor cut and a few major scratches . Do n't be insulted . " " You 're bleeding . . . your neck . " " And my back , and a fork scrape  --  I guess you 'd call it  --  on my stomach , " said Michael . " You can nurse me later and I 'll be grateful , but right now it fits the picture they have . I 'm bringing you back on Aeroflot . " " Do I continue fighting ? " " No , just be hostile . You 're resigned ; you know you ca n't win . It 'll go harder for you if you struggle . " " And Kohoutek ? " " He says you 're to stay in the back seat with him . He 'll have us both under a gun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand will drop . " " Something like that . It 's a long trip , a lot can happen . A gas station , a breakdown , no lights . He may be a mountain bull but he 's close to seventy . " Havelock held her shoulders . " He may decide to drug you . If he does , I 'll try to stop him . " " He wo n't give me anything dangerous ; he wants his money . I 'm not concerned . I 'll know you 're there and I know what you can do . " " Come on . " " Mikhail . " She gripped his hands . " What happened ? To me . . . to you ? They said such dreadful things , such terrible things ! I could n't believe them , yet I had to believe . It was there ! " " It was all there . Down to my watching you die . " " Oh , God ... " " I 've been running away ever since , until that night in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After you , after them  --  after the liars who did this to us . " " How did they do it ? " " There 's no time now . I 'll tell you everything I can later , and then I want to hear you . Everything . You have the names , you know the people . Later . " They stood up and embraced , holding each other briefly , feeling the warmth and the hope each gave the other . Michael pulled a handkerchief from his breast pocket and held it against his neck . Jenna took his hand away and blotted the deep scratches herself ; she touched the bridge of his nose , where she had struck him with her knee , then smoothed his hair at the temples . " Remember , my darling , " she whispered . " Treat me sternly . Push me and shove me and grab my arm firmly as you do it . A man who 's been  | scratched by a woman , whether she 's his enemy or not , is an angry man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounds . " " Thank you , Sigmund Freud . Let 's go . " The guard in the black leather jacket smiled at the sight of Havelock 's bleeding neck while the Cuban nodded his head , his expression confirming a previous judgment . As instructed , Michael held Jenna 's arm in a viselike grip , propelling her forward at his side , his mouth set , his eyes controlled but furious . " I want to go back to Kohoutek and get out of here ! " he said angrily . " And I do n't care for any discussion , is that understood ? " " Did the great big man get hurt by the little bitty girl ? " said the guard , grinning . " Shut up , you goddamned idiot ! " " Come to think of it , she 's not that little . " Janos Kohoutek was dressed in a heavy mackinaw coat , a fur-lined cap on his head . He , too , smiled at the handkerchief held in place on Havelock 's neck . " Perhaps this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking English , his stained teeth showing . " The old wives ' tales say they have the strength of mountain cats and the cunning of ( lemons .

" It 's not so bad , more wind than anything , " said the bull , taking a roll of thick cord out of his pocket and walking toward Jenna . " They keep the turnpike clear . " " What 's that ? " asked Havelock , gesturing at the cord . " Hold out her hands , " ordered Kohoutek , addressing the guard . " You may care to put up with this cat , but I do not . " " I smoke , " protested Jenna . " Let me smoke , I 'm very nervous . What can I do ? " " Perhaps you would prefer a needle ? Then there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't accept drugs , " interrupted Michael firmly . " The airports are watched , especially our departure gates . No narcotics . " " Then she 'll be tied . Come , take her hand . " The guard in the leather jacket approached Jenna ; haltingly she put out her hands , so as not to be touched more than necessary . Kohoutek stopped . " Has she been to the  | toilet ? " he asked harshly of no one , and no one answered . " Tell me , woman , have you been to the toilet ? " " I 'm all right , " said Jenna . " For a number of hours ? There 'll be no stops , you understand ? Even to sit on the side of the road with a gun at your head , there 'll be no stops . Rozumis ? " " I said I 'm all right . " " Tie her , and let 's go . " Havelock took several impatient steps toward the door , passing the Moravian and glancing at Jenna . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assume this refugee from a zalar will take us up in the truck . " The guard looked angry as Kohoutek grinned . " You are not far wrong , Havlicek . He 's been put away for aggravated assault several times . Yes , he 'll take us . " The bull pulled the cord tight around Jenna 's hands , then turned and shouted , " Axel ! " " He has my weapon , " said Michael , gesturing at the man in the leather jacket . " I 'd like it back . " " You shall have it . At a street corner in New York . " The second guard entered the room from the hallway , the same man who had first seen Havelock awake on the floor . " Yes , Mr. Kohoutek ? " " You 're handling the schedules tomorrow , no ? " " Yes , sir . " " Stay in radio contact with the north trucks and have one pick me up in Monongahela after my plane arrives tomorrow . I will phone from the airport and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right . " " We go , " said the mountain bull , heading for the door . Michael took Jenna 's arm , the guard in the leather jacket following . Outside , the wind was stronger than before , the snow angrier , whipping in circles and stinging the face . With Kohoutek leading , they ran down the farmhouse path to the truck in the road . A third guard , wearing a white parka , stood by the gate fifty yards away ; he saw them and walked to the center latch . The truck was enclosed ; there were facing wooden benches in the van for transporting a cargo of five to six on each side , and coiled ropes hung on the walls . At the sight of the covered , windowless quarters Jenna was visibly shaken , and Havelock understood . Her country  --  his native country  --  had seen too many such vehicles over the years , heard too many  | stories told in whispers of convoys carrying away men and women and children who were never seen again . This was Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers of these trucks were no different from their brothers in Prague and Warsaw , late of Moscow  --  before then , Berlin . " Get in , get in ! " shouted Kohoutek , now waving a large .45 automatic as the guard held the handle of the rear door . " I 'm not your prisoner ! " yelled Havelock . " We negotiated ! We have an agreement ! " " And part of that agreement , priteli , is that you are my guest as well as my hostage until we reach New York . After delivery  --  both deliveries ? I shall be happy to put away the gun and buy you dinner . " The mountain bull roared with laughter as Jenna and Michael climbed into the van . They sat next to each other , but this was not to Kohoutek 's liking . He said , " The woman moving to the other side , seeking out the shadows . The door was closed , the latch and lock manipulated by the guard . A dim light came through the windshield . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the reflected spill partially illuminating the van . In the darkness he pulled up his coat and reached behind him with his right hand , inching toward the knife clipped to his belt in the small of his back . If he did not remove it now , it would be infinitely more difficult later when he was behind the wheel of his car . " What 's that ? " shouted the bull , raising his gun in the shadows , pointlug it at Havelock 's head . " What are you doing ? " " The bitch cat clawed my back ; the blood 's sticking to my shirt , " said Michael in a normal voice . Then he yelled , " Do you want to see it , feel it ? " Kohoutek grinned , glancing at Jenna . " A Carpathian carodejka . The non 's probably full but we ca n't see it . " He laughed his crude mountain laugh once more . " I trust the Lubyanka is as tight as it ever was . She 'll cat your guards up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jenna gasped , shuddering . " Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! " Kohoutek looked at her again , and again Havelock understood  --  she was covering for him . He quickly pulled the knife out of the scabbard and palmed it in his right hand . It had all taken less than twelve seconds . The driver 's door opened ; the guard climbed in and switched on the  | lights . He looked behind ; the old bull nodded and he turned the ignition key . The vehicle had a powerful engine , and a minute later they had passed through the gate and were climbing the steep hill , the heavytreaded tires crunching the snow and the soft earth beneath them , lurching , vibrating , rolling with the uneven pitch of the ground . They reached the wall of trees where the road flattened out ; there was perhaps threeeighths of a winding mile to go before the Fourforks Pike . The guarddriver gathered speed , then suddenly stepped on the brake , stopping the truck instantly . A red light was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch , then another , and snapped both . There was a prolonged burst of static over the radio as an excited voice shouted through the eruptions : " Mr. Kohoutek ! Mr. Kohoutek ! " " What is it ? " asked the guard , grabbing a microphone from the dashboard and depressing a button . " You 're on the emergency channel . " " The sparrow in New York  --  he 's on the phone ! Handelman 's dead ! He heard it on the radio ! He was shot in his apartment , and the police are looking for a man ... " Havelock lunged , twisting the handle of the knife into his clenched fist , the blade protruding downward , his left hand reaching for the barrel of the .45 automatic . Jenna sprang away ; he gripped the long , flat steel as Kohoutek rose , then slamming the gun back down on the wooden bench , he plunged the knife through the mountain bull 's hand , the point embedding  --  through flesh and bone  --  in the wood , the bloody hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat spun around as Jenna threw herself at him , crashing her roped hands down on his neck , and pulled the microphone out of his grip , cutting off the transmission . Havelock swung the gun up into the old bull 's head ; Kohoutek lurched back into the wall and fell forward on the floor of the van , his arm stretched out , his hand still nailed to the wooden bench . " Mikhail ! " The guard had recovered from Jenna 's blows and was pulling the Llama out of his leather jacket . Michael sprang forward and jammed the heavy barrel of the .45 into the man 's temple ; reaching over his shoulder , he pressed down , holding the Llama in place . " Mr. Kohoutek ? Have you got it ? " yelled the voice through the radio static . " What should the sparrow do ? He wants to know ! " " Tell him you 've got it , " ordered Havelock , breathing hard , thumbing back the hammer of the gun . " Say the sparrow should do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've got it . " The guard 's voice was a whisper . " Tell the sparrow not to do anything . We 'll be in touch . " Michael yanked the microphone away and pointed to the Llama . " Now , just hand it to me slowly , " he said . " Use your fingers , just two fingers , " he continued . " After all , it 's mine , is n't it ? " " I was going to give it back , " said the frightened guard , his lips trembling . " How many years can you give back to the people you drove in this thing ? " " That has n't anything to do with me , I swear it ! I just work for a living . I do what I 'm told . " " You all do . " Havelock took the Llama and moved the automatic around the man 's head , pressing it into the base of his skull . " Now , drive us out of here , " he said .  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the telephone booth at the corner of 116th Street and Riverside Drive . The wet city snow was clinging to the glass , blurring the rotating red lights of the police cars up the block . He inserted the coin , dialed o , then five additional digits ; he heard the second tone and dialed again . In moments a private phone was ringing in the living quarters of the White House . " Yes ? " " Mr. President ? " " Emory ? How did it go ? " " It did n't . He 's dead . He was shot . " The silence from Washington was interrupted only by the sound of Berquist 's breathing . " Tell me what happened , " said the President . " It was Havelock , but the name was n't reported correctly . We can deny the existence of any such person at State . " " Havelock ? At . . . ? Oh my God ! " " I do n't know all the details , but enough . The shuttle was delayed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time I got here there were crowds , police cars , a few press and an ambulance . " " The press ? " " Yes , sir . Handelman 's prominent here . Not only because he was a Jew  | who survived Bergen-Belsen , but because of his standing at the university . He was respected , even revered . " " Oh , Christ . . . What did you learn ? How did you learn it ? Your name wo n't surface , will it ? " " No , sir . I used my rank at State and reached the precinct up here ; the detective was cooperative . Apparently Handelman had an appointment with a female graduate student , who came back to the building twice before ringing the superintendent . They went up to Handelman 's apartment , saw the door was unlocked , went inside , and found him . The superintendent called the police , and when they got here , he admitted having let in a man who had State Department credentials . He said his name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but insisted the ID was in order . The police are still in Handelman 's apartment getting fingerprints , cloth and blood scrapings . " " Have the details been made public ? " " In this town they ca n't wait . It was all released twenty minutes ago . There was no way I could stop it , if I wanted to . But State does n't have to clarify ; we can deny . " The President was silent , then he spoke . " When the time is right , the Department of State will cooperate fully with the authorities . Until then I want a file built  --  and circulated on a restricted basis  --  around Havelock 's activities since his separation from the government . It must reflect the government 's alarm over his mental state , his apparent homicidal tendencies  --  his loyalty . However , in the interests of national security , that file will remain under restricted classification . It will not be made public . " " I 'm not sure I understand . " " The facts will be revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interests . " " Sir ? " " One man is insignificant , " said the President softly . " Coventry , Mr. Undersecretary . The Enigma . . . Parsifal . " " I accept the reasoning , sir , not the assumption . How can we be sure we 'll find him ? " " I Ic 'll find us ; he 'll find you . If everything we 've learned about Havelock is as accurate as we believe , he would n't have killed Jacob Handelman unless he had an extraordinary reason . And he would never have killed him if he had n't learned where I landclman sent the Karas woman . When he reaches her , he 'll know about you . "  | Bradford paused , his breath visible , the vapor briefly interrupted . " Yes , of course , Mr. President . " " Get back here as fast as you can . We have to be ready . . . you have to be ready . I 'll have two men flown up from Poole 's Island . They 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive . " " Yes , sir . " " Now , listen to me , Emory . My instructions will be direct , the explanation clear . By presidential order you are to be given round-the-clock protection ; your life is in their hands . You are being hunted by a killer who 's sold his government 's secrets to the enemy . Those will be the words I use ; yours will be different . You will use the language of Consular Operations : Havelock is beyond salvage . ' Every additional hour he lives is a danger to our men in the field . " " I understand . " " Emory ? " " Sir ? " " Before all this happened I never really knew you , not personally , " said Berquist softly . " What 's your situation at home ? " " Home ? " " It 's where he 'll come for you . Are there children at home ? " " Children ? No , no , there are no children . My older son 's in college , my younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard somewhere that you had daughters . " " Two . They 're with their mother . In Wisconsin . " " I see . I did n't know . Is there another wife ? " " There were . Again , two . They did n't last . " " Then there are no women living in your house ? " " There are frequently , but not at the minute . Very few during the past four months . " " I see . " " I live alone . The circumstances are optimum , Mr. President . " " Yes , I guess they are . " Using the coiled ropes on the wall of the van , they tied the guard to the steering wheel , Kohoutek to the bench . " Find whatever you can and bind his hand , " said Michael . " I want him alive . I want someone to ask him questions . " Jenna found a farmer 's kerchief in the glove compartment . She removed the scaling knife from the old mountain bull 's huge hand , ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound , stemming the blood at both the gash and the wrist . " It will hold for three , perhaps four hours , " she said . " After that , I do n't know . If he wakes and tears it , he could bleed to death . . . . Knowing what I know , I have no use for prayers . " " Someone 'll find him . Them . This truck . It 'll be light in an hour or so , and the Fourforks Pike 's a county route . Sit down for a minute . " Havelock started the engine and , reaching over the guard 's leg , depressed the clutch and shoved the truck in gear . Wrenching the man back and forth over the steering wheel , he maneuvered the vehicle so that it was broadside across the road . " Okay , let 's get out . " " You ca n't leave me here ! " whined the guard . " Jesus ! " " Have you been to the toilet ? " " What ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes ? " " The radio . Someone might come along and free him . He 'd use it . We need every minute . " Havelock picked up the .45 from the seat and smashed the thick , blunt handle repeatedly into the dials and switches until there was nothing but shattered glass and plastic . Finally , he ripped the microphone out of its receptacle , severing the wires ; he opened the door and turned to Jenna . " We 'll leave the lights on so no one smashes into it , " he said , stepping out and pulling the seat forward for her . " One more thing to do . Come on . Because of the wind , the Fourforks Pike had less than an inch of snow on the surface except for the intermittent drifts that had been pummeled into the bordering grass . Michael handed the .45 to Jenna , and switched the Ilama to his right hand . " That makes too much noise , " he continued . " ' I'Ite wind might carry it down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the van and fired twice , blowing out both rear tires . He raced up the other side and fired into the front tires . The truck I I K kcd back and forth as the tires deflated and settled into the road . To clear the highway , it could be driven into the grass , but it would go no farther than that . He put the Llama into his pocket . " I , et me have the forty-five , " he said to Jenna , pulling his shirt out of his trousers . She gave it to hint . " What arc you going to do ? "  | " Wipe it clean . Not that it 'll do much good , our prints are all over inside the van . But they may not brush there ; they will this . " " So ? " " I 'm gambling that our driver in his own self-interest will yell like hell ) that it 's not his , that it belongs to his employer , your host , Kohoutek . " " Ballistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe something else . That farm will be torn apart , and when it is , they may start digging around those acres . There could be killings not on file . " He held the automatic with his shirttail , opened the door of the truck and arced the weapon over the front seat into the covered van . " Hey , come on , for Christ 's sake ! " shouted the driver , twisting and turning against the ropes . " Let me out of here , will ya ? I did n't do nothing to you ! They 'll send me back for ten years ! " " They 're a lot easier on people who turn state 's evidence . Think about it . " Havelock slammed the door and walked rapidly back to Jenna . " The car 's about a quarter of a mile down on the other side of Kohoutek 's road . Are you all right ? " She looked at him ; particles of snow stuck to her blond hair swirling in the wind and her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling , I 'm all right .... Wherever we are at this moment , I 'm home . " He took her hand and they started down the road . " Walk in the center so our footsteps will be covered . " She sat close to him , touching him , her arm through his , her head intermittently resting on his shoulder as he drove . The words between them were few , the silences comforting ; they were too tired and too afraid to talk sensibly , at least for a while . They had been there before ; they knew a little peace would come with the quiet  --  and being with each other . Remembering Kohoutek 's words , Havelock headed north to the Pennsylvania Turnpike , then east toward Harrisburg . The old Moravian had been right ; the low-flying winds virtually swept the wide expanse of highway , and the subfreezing temperature kept the snow dry and buoyant . Although the visibility was poor , the traveling was fast . " Is this the main auto route ? " asked Jenna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is it wise to be on it ? If Kohoutek 's found before daybreak , might not men be watching this turnpike ' as they do the Bahnen and the drdha ? " " We 're the last people on earth he wants the police to find . We know  | what that farm is . He 'll stall , use the intruder story , say he was the hostage , the victim . And the guard wo n't say anything until he has n't got a choice , or until they find his record , and then he 'll bargain . We 're all right . " " That 's the police , darling , " said Jenna , her hand gently touching his forearm . " Suppose it is not the police ? You want it to be the police , so you convince yourself . But suppose it is someone else ? A farmer or a driver of a milk truck . I think Kohoutek would pay a great deal of money to get safely back to his home . " Michael looked at her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dark circles under them ; fear was still in the center of her stare . Yet in spite of the exhaustion and the dread , she was thinking  --  better than he . But then she had been hunted far more often than he , more recently than he . Above all , she would not panic ; she knew the value of control even when the pain and the fear were overwhelming . He leaned over and brushed his lips on her face . " You 're magnificent , " he said . " I 'm frightened , " she replied . " And you 're also right . There 's a childish song that says wishing will make it so . ' It 's a lie , and only for children , but I was counting on it , hoping for it . The odds of the police finding Kohoutek , or a citizen reporting what he found to the police , are no better than seventy-thirty . Against . We 'll get off at the next exit and head south . " " To where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can be alone , and not moving . Not running . " She sat in a chair by the motel window , the early light spreading up and over the Allegheny Mountains outside in the distance . The yellow rays heightened the gold in the long blond hair that fell across her shoulders . Alternately she would look at him , then turn her face away and close her eyes ; his words were too painful to hear in the light . When he finished , he was still caught in the anguish that came with the admission : he had been her executioner . He had killed his love and there had been no love left in him . Jenna rose from the chair and stood silently by the window . " What did they do to us ? " she whispered . 1 lavelock stood across the room watching her ; he could not look away . And then he was drifting back through indeterminate time , through the rolling mists of a haunting , obsessive dream that never left him . The images were there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life only to rise up and attack him , inflaming him whenever the memories refused to stay buried . What 's left when your memory 's gone , Mr. Smith ? Nothing , of course , yet how often had he wished for oblivion , with no images or remembered moments  --  trading nothingness for the absence of pain . But now he had passed through the nightmare of interrupted sleep and had come to life , just as the tears had come to Jenna 's eyes and washed away the hatred . But the reality was fragile ; its fragments had to be pieced together . " We have to find out why , " said Michael . " Broussac told me what happened to you , but there were gaps I could n't understand . " " I did n't tell her everything , " said Jenna , gazing at the snow outside . " I did n't lie to her , but I did n't tell her everything . I was afraid she would n't help me . " " What did you leave out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me . He 's been with your government for a number of years . He was once quite controversial , but still respected , I think . At least , I 'd heard of him . " " Who was it ? " " A man named Bradford . Emory Bradford . " " Good God ... " Havelock was stunned . Bradford was a name from the past , a disquieting past . He had been one of the political comets born under Kennedy and winning dubious spurs with Johnson . When the comets had faded from the Washington firmament , heading for the international banks and the foundations , the prestigious law offices and the corporate boardrooms , Bradford had remained  --  less celebrated , to be sure , and less influential , certainly  --  where the political wars had been fought . It was never understood why . A degree of personal wealth aside , he could have done a thousand other things , but he had chosen not to . Bradford , thought Havelock , the name echoing in his head . All these years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another version of Camelot to carry him into another time of self-aggrandizing glory ? It had to be . If he had reached Jenna in Barcelona , he was at the core of the deception at Costa Brava , a deception that went far beyond himself and Jenna , two lovers turned against each other . It linked unseen men in Moscow with powerful men in the United States government . " Do you know him ? " asked Jenna , still staring out the window . " Not personally . I 've never met him . But you 're right , he was controversial , and most everyone knows him . The last I heard he was an undersecretary of State with a low profile but a pretty high reputation  --  buried  | but valuable , you could say . He told you he was with Cons Op out of Madrid ? " " He said he was on special assignment with Consular Operations , an emergency involving internal security . " " Me ? " " Yes . He showed me copies of documents found in a bank vault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you recall telling me you had to go to the Ramblas on several occasions ? " " It was a drop for Lisbon , I also told you that . Never mind , it was orchestrated . " " But you can understand . The Ramblas stayed in my mind . " " They made sure of it . What were the documents ? " " Instructions from Moscow that could only have been meant for you . There were dates , itineraries ; everything corresponded to where we 'd been , where we were going . And there were codes ; if they were n't authentic , then I 'd never seen a Russian cipher . " " The same materials I was given , " said Havelock , his anger surfacing . " Yes , I knew it when you told me what they gave you in Madrid . Not all , of course , but many of the same documents and much of the same information they showed you they showed me . Even down to the radio in the hotel room . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we never listened to the radio . " " When I saw it , a great part of me died , " said jenna . " When I found the key in your purse and it matched the one the evidence in Madrid said you would have  --  a key to an airport locker  --  I could n't stay in the same room with you . " " That was it , was n't it ? The final confirmation for both of us . I had changed , I could n't help it . And when you came back from Madrid , you were different . It was as if you were being pulled violently in several directions , but with only one true commitment , and it was not to me , not to us . You had sold yourself to the Soviets for reasons I could n't understand . . . . I even tried to rationalize ; perhaps after thirty years there was news of your father  --  stranger things have happened . Or you were going into deep cover without me ; a defector in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the transition  --  whatever it was  --  did iwt include me. " jenna turned back to the window . She continued , her voice barely audible , " Then Bradford reached me again ; this time he was panicked , nearly out of control . He said the word had just been inter-  | cepted  --  Moscow had ordered my execution . You were to lead me into a trap , and you were going to do it that night . " " At the Costa Brava ? " " No , he never mentioned the Costa Brava . He said a man would call around six o'clock while you were out , using a phrase or description I 'd recognize as coming only from you . He would say that you could not get to a telephone , but I was to take the car and drive down the coast to Villanueva , that you would meet me by the fountains in the plaza . But you would n't , because I 'd never get there . I 'd be taken on the road . " " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was part of the Cons Op strategy . With me supposedly twenty miles south on business , you had time to get up to the Montebello beach on the Costa Brava . It was the final proof against you . I was to witness it  --  I demanded that , hoping to Christ you 'd never show up . " " It all fit , it was made to fit ! " cried Jenna . " Bradford said if that call came , I was to run . Another American would be in the lobby with him , watching for the KGB . They 'd take me to the consulate . " " But you did n't leave with them . The woman I saw die was n't you . " " I could n't . I suddenly could n't trust anyone . . . . Do you remember the incident that night at the cafe in the Paseo Isabel just before you went to Madrid ? " " The drunk , " said Havelock , remembering all too well . " He bumped into you  --  fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and kissing it . He was all over you . " " We laughed about it . You more than I. " " I did n't a couple of days later . I was convinced that was when you were given the key to the airport locker . " " Which I never knew about . " " And which I found in your purse because Bradford put it there while he was in the hotel room and I was in Madrid . I assume you excused yourself for a moment or two . " " I was in shock ; I was ill . I 'm sure I did . " " It explains the radio , the maritime frequency .... What about the drunk ? " " He was the other American in the lobby of the hotel . Why was he there ? Who was he ? I went back up as fast as I could . " " He did n't see you ? " " No , I used the staircase . His face frightened me , I ca n't tell you why . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone  | so different , I do n't know . I do know his eyes disturbed me ; they were angry , but they did not look around . He was n't watching the lobby for the KGB ; he only kept glancing at his watch . By then I was in a panic myself  --  confused , and hurt more than I 'd ever been hurt in my life . You were going to let me die , and suddenly I could n't trust them . " " You went back to the room ? " " God , no , I 'd have been cornered . I went up to the floor , stayed in the stairwell , and tried to think things through . I thought perhaps I was being hysterical , too frightened to act reasonably . Why did n't I trust the Americans ? I 'd about made up my mind to go back down when I heard noises from the corridor inside . I opened the door a bit . . . and knew that I was right to do what I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bradford knocked on the door several times , and while he was knocking , the other man  --  the drunk from the cafe  --  took out a gun . When there was no answer , they waited until they were sure there was no one in the hallway . Then , with one kick , the man with the gun broke down the door and rushed inside . It was not the action of men who 'd come to save someone . I ran . " Havelock , watching her , tried to think . There were so many ambiguities ... ambiguity . Where were the outlines of the man who had used the code Ambiguity ? " How did they get your suitcase ? " he asked . " As you described it , it was an old one of mine . The last I recall I simply left it in the basement of the flat I leased in Prague . You may have carried it down , in fact . " " The KGB would find it . " " The KGB ? " " Someone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you ? . . . There has to be someone . " " What was the phrase or description the man gave you over the phone ? The words you were to think came from me . " " Again Prague . He said there was a cobblestone courtyard in the center of the city . ' " " Verejnd mistnost , " said Michael , nodding . " Prague 's Soviet police . ' I'licy 'd know about that . In a report I sent to Washington I described how you got out of that place , how great you were . And how I damn near died watching you from a window three stories above . " " ' Thank you for the commendation. "  |  " We were putting all our points together , remember ? We were going to break out of our movable prison . " " And you were going to teach . " " History . " " And we were going to have children ? " " And send them off to school ? " " And love them and scold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You said there were no such things ? " " I love you ... " " Mikhail ? " The first steps were tentative , but the pavane was suddenly finished . They ran to each other , and held each other , pushing time away , and hurt , and a thousand moments of anguish . Her tears came , washing away the final barricades mounted by liars and men who served the liars . Their arms grew stronger around each other , the straining of their bodies an exertion each understood ; their lips met , swollen , probing , searching for the release they held for each other . They were trapped as never before in their movable prison  --  they understood that , too  --  but for the moment they were also free . The dream had come fully to life , the reality no longer fragile . She was beside him , her face touching his shoulder , her lips parted , the breath of her deep , steady breathing warming his skin . As so often in the past , strands of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in sleep she was a part of him . He turned carefully , so as not to waken her , and looked down at her . The dark shadows under her eyes were still there , but they were fading as a hint of color returned to her pale flesh . It would take days , perhaps weeks , for the fear in her eyes to disappear . Yet in spite of it , her strength was there ; it had carried her through unbearable tensions . She moved , stretching , and her face was bathed in the sunlight that streamed through the windows . As he watched her he thought of what she had been through , what resources she must have had to summon in order to survive . Where had she been ? Who were the people who had helped her , hurt her ? There were so many questions , so many things he wanted to know . A part of him was a callow adolescent , jealous of the images he did not wish to imagine , while another part of him was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay to remain alive in their disorderly , so frequently violent world . The answers would conic  | with time , revealed slowly or in eruptions of memory or resentment , but they would not be provoked by him . The healing process could not be forced ; it would be too easy for Jenna to sink back and relive the terrors and , by reliving them , prolong them . She moved again , her face returning to him , her breath warm . And then the absurdity of his thoughts struck him . Where did he think he was ... they were ? What did he think would be permitted them ? How could he dare to think in terms of any time at all ? Jacob Handelman was dead , his killer as good as identified  --  certainly known by now to the liars in Washington . The manhunt would be given respectability ; he could see the story in the newspapers : a beloved scholar brutally slaughtered by a deranged former foreign service officer wanted by his government for all manner of crimes . Who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had suffered the horrors of the camps was in reality a strutting man-monster who had ordered up the guns of Lidice ? Insane ! Broussac would turn ; anyone he might have counted on would not touch him now , touch them now . There was no time for healing , they needed every hour ; the swiftness of their strikes  --  his strikes  --  was essential . He looked at his watch ; it was two-forty-five , the day three-quarters gone . There were strategies to consider  --  liars to reach at night . Yet there had to be something . For them , only themselves ; to ease the ache , erase the vestiges of fragility . If there was not , there was nothing . Ile did what he had dreamt of , waking up in sweat whenever the dream had recurred , knowing it could never be . It could be now . He whispered her name , calling out to her across the chasms of sleep . And as if the moments away from each other had never been , her hand reached for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then without speaking , she raised the covers and came to him . She pressed her naked body against his , her arms enveloping him , her lips against his . They were silent as their excitement grew ; only the throated cries of peed and anxiety were heard in the room . The need was each for the other , and the anxiety was not to be feared . They made love twice more , but the third time was more successful in the attempt than in the completion . The rays of the sun no longer streaked through the window ; instead there was an orange glow that was the reflection of a country sundown . They sat up in bed , Michael lighting her cigarette , both laughing softly at their misguided energies , their ternpinny exhaust ir " You 're going to throw me out for a hot-blooded stag from Ankara . "  | " You have nothing at all to apologize for , my darling . . . my Mikhail . Besides , I really do n't like their coffee . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , touching the bandage on his shoulder . " I 'm in love . There 's so much to make up for . " " Both of us , not you alone . You must not think that way . I accepted the lies , just as you did . Incredible lies , incredibly presented . And we do n't know why . " " But we know the purpose , which gives us part of the why . To get me out but keep me under control , under a microscope . " " With my defection , my death ? There are other ways of terminating a man you no longer want . " " Killing him ? " said Havelock , nodding ; then he paused and shook his head . " It 's one way , yes . But then there 's no way to control whatever damaging evidence he may have left behind . The possibility that such a man has left that information often keeps him alive . " " But they want to kill you now . You 're beyond salvage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This person called Ambiguity , " said Jenna . " Yes . Whatever I know  --  or they think I know  --  has been supplanted by a larger threat much more dangerous to them . Again , me . What I found , what I learned . " " I do n't understand . " " You , " said Havelock . " The Costa Brava . It has to be buried . " " The Soviet connection ? " " I do n't know . Who was the woman on the beach ? What did she think she was doing there ? Why was n't it you  --  thank Christ , it was n't  --  but why was n't it ? Where were they taking you ? " " To my grave , I think . " " If that was the case , why were n't you sent to that beach ? Why were n't you killed there ? " " Perhaps they felt I would n't go . I did n't leave the hotel with them . " " They could n't have known that then . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting protection . The point is , they never mentioned the Costa Brava ; they did n't even try to prime you . " " I would have driven there that night  --  all you had to do was call me . I would have come . They could have had their execution ; you would have seen what they wanted you to see . " " It does n't make sense . " Michael struck a match and lit a cigarette for  | himself . " And that 's the basic inconsistency , because whoever put Costa Brava together was a hell of a technician , an expert in black operations . It was brilliantly structured , down to split-second timing . . . . It does n't make sense ! " Jenna broke the long silence . " Mikhail , " she said quietly , sitting forward , her eyes clouded , focused inward . " Two operations , " she whispered . " What ? " " Suppose there were two operations , not one ? " She turned to him , her eyes alive now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against me  --  then carried forward to Barcelona  --  the evidence against you . " " Still one blanket , " said Havelock . " But then it was torn , " insisted Jenna . " It became two . " " How ? " " The original operation is intercepted , " she said . " By someone not part of it . " " Then altered , " he said , beginning to understand . " The cloth is the same but the stitches are twisted , ending up being something else . A different blanket . " " Still , for what purpose ? " she asked . " Control , " he answered . " Then you got away and the control was lost . Broussac told me there 's been a coded alert out for you ever since Costa Brava . " " Very coded , " agreed Jenna , crushing out her cigarette . " Which could mean whoever intercepted the operation and altered it might not have known that I had gotten out of Barcelona alive . " " Until I saw you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point we both had to die ; one by the black-operations book  --  that was me . The other out of strategy  --  no one in sanction aware  --  a bomb blowing up a car outside of Col des Moulinets . You . Everything buried . " " Again Anibiguity ? " " No one else could have done it . No one else but a man with the clearance code could have infiltrated the strategy at that bridge . " Jenna looked at him , then across at the windows ; the orange glow was fading . " ' I'Ihcre are still too many omissions . Too many gaps . " " We 'll fill some of them in , maybe all . " " Emory Iii adford , of course . " " And someone else , " said Havelock . " Matthias . Four days ago I tried to reach hint from Cagncs-sur-Mer on his private line  --  very few people have the number . I could n't understand it , but he would n't talk to me.  | You ca n't know how crazy it was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought the worst : the man closest to me had cut me off . Then you tell me about Bradford , and I 'm beginning to think I was wrong . " " How do you mean ? " " Suppose Anton was n't there ? Suppose others had taken over that private place , that very private line ? " " Bradford ? " " And whatever 's left of his tribe . The return of the political comets , looking for a way to get their fires back . According to Time magazine , Matthias is off on an extended holiday , but what if he 's not ? What if the most celebrated Secretary of State in history is being held incommunicado . In a clinic somewhere , unable to get word out . " " But that 's incredible , Mikhail . A man like that would have to stay in touch with his office . There are daily briefings , decisions ? " " It could be done through second and third parties , aides known to State personnel . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they told me Anton would n't talk to me , I could n't accept it . I made another call  --  to an old man , a neighbor of Matthias 's whom he saw whenever he went to his lodge in the Shenandoah . His name 's Zelienski and he 's good for Anton  --  a retired professor brought over from Warsaw a number of years ago . They 'd sit around playing chess , talking about the old days . He was a tonic for Matthias and both of them knew it , especially Anton , but when I spoke to Zelienski he said Anton did n't have time for him these days . Did n't have time . " " It 's entirely possible , Mikhail . " " But not consistent . Matthias would make the time ; he would n't cut off an old friend without at least some kind of explanation , any more than he would me . It is not like him . " " How do you mean ? " " I remember Zelienski 's words . He said he 'd leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthias 's regrets , saying he rarely drove out to the valley anymore . But he did ; he was there in the valley when I called . Or he was supposed to be . My point is , he may not have been . " " Now you 're not consistent , " broke in Jenna . " If what you say is true , why did n't they simply say he was n't there ? " " They could n't . I used the private line and it 's to be answered only if he 's on the premises , and only by him . Someone picked up the phone by mistake and tried to cover it . "  | " Someone working for Bradford ? " " Someone who 's part of a conspiracy against Matthias , at any rate , and I would n't exclude Bradford . Men in Washington are dealing secretly with men in Moscow . Together they built Costa Brava , convincing Matthias you 're a Soviet agent  --  his note to me made that clear . We do n't know whether everything went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthias had nothing to do with it and Bradford did . Anton did n't trust Emory Bradford and his crowd ; he considered them the worst sort of opportunists . He kept them away from extremely sensitive negotiations because he believed they 'd use them for their own ends . He had a point ; they did it before , letting the country know only what they wanted people to hear , using the classification stamp so that it became their signature . " Michael paused , inhaling on his cigarette as Jenna looked at him . " He may be doing it again , God knows for what purpose . It 'll be dark soon and we can drive . We 'll head across into Maryland , then down to Washington . , , " To Bradford ? " Havelock nodded . Jenna touched his arm and said , " They 'll connect you with Handelman and assume you reached me . They 'll know the first name I 'd give you is Bradford 's . They 'll guard him . " " I know that , " said Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat and find a newspaper , one that carries the wire services . We 'll talk in the car . " Ile began walking toward his suitcase , then stopped . " My God , your clothes . I did n't think ; you do n't have your clothes . " " Kohoutek 's people took them , took everything . They said foreign labels , European luggage , mementos  --  anything like that  --  had to be confiscated for our own good . There could be no traces of where we came from . They would supply me with something suitable later . " " Suitable for what ? " " I was too frightened to think . " " Take all your possessions , and leave you alone in a cell . " So much to nrake up for . " Let 's go , " he said . " We should stop somewhere and pick up a Red Cross kit , " added Jciina . " That dressing on your shoulder should be changed . I can do it . " So much to make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they saw a dispenser for newspapers reflected in the light of the entrance . There were two papers left , both afternoon editions of the Baltimore Sun . They took both , to see whether any photographs had been released that might alert someone inside the roadside restaurant . Shaving the negative odds was instinct . They sat across from each other in a corner booth . They turned the pages rapidly , and when they had gone through them all , they breathed easier . There were no photographs . They would go back and study the article in a moment ; it was on page three . " You must be starved , " said Havelock . " To tell you the truth , I 'd like a drink , if they serve one here . " " They do . I 'll order . " He glanced at the counter and held up his hand . " I have n't even thought about eating . " " That 's strange . Kohoutek said you would n't eat last night , that you threw the tray at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ate ; you always told me never to leave food when you 're in a bad situation . That you never know when you 'll get another meal . " " Listen to Mother . "  | " I listened to a child running for his life through the woods . " " History . Why did you throw the tray ? To keep him away from you ? " " To get the fork . There was no knife . " " You 're something , lady . " " I was desperate . Stop complimenting me . " A plump , overly-made-up waitress approached the table , her eyes appraising Jenna with a mixture of sadness and envy . Michael understood , neither with satisfaction nor in condescension ; he merely understood . Jenna Karas was that often-forgotten person , whether she was forced to kill in order to survive , or be seduced so she might live . She was a lady . Havelock ordered their drinks . The waitress smiled as she nodded and left quickly ; she would return quickly . " Let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper . " It 's on the third page . " " I know . Did you read it ? " " Only the bottom line where it said continued on page eleven . ' I thought they might have included a photograph there . " " So did I. " Havelock began reading as Jenna watched him . The waitress returned , placing their drinks on the table . " We 'll order food in a minute , " said Michael , his eyes riveted on the paper . The waitress left as I lavelock quickly flipped the pages , snapping the paper in place . As he read on he experienced relief , then concern and , finally , alarm . He finished and leaned back in the booth , staring at Jenna . " What is it ? What does it say ? " " They 're covering it up , " he said softly . " What ? " " They 're protecting me . . . actually protecting me . " " You could n't have read it properly . " " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning the lines in the column of the paper . " Listen to this . According to the State Department , no such individual matching the name , the description , or the fingerprints is currently or has ever been in the employ of the Department of State . Further , a spokesman for State said that to speculate on the similarity of the reported name of the killer with that of any present or past employee would be grossly unfair and inaccurate . A thorough computer check was made upon receipt of the Manhattan police report , and the results were negative . However , the State Department 's report revealed that the slain Professor Handelman had acted as a consultant to the I ) cpartnment in the area of European refugee displacement , with  | emphasis on those persons who had survived the Nazi period . According to a spokesman , the Manhattan police theorize that the killer may be a member of a terrorist organization violently hostile to the Jewish community . The State Department pointed out that it is not uncommon for terrorists in all countries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and looked up at Jenna . " That 's it , " he said . " They 've thrown everybody off . " " Could they believe it ? " " Not possible . To begin with , there are a hundred people in and out of State who know I was with Consular Operations . They 'd put the names together and come up with mine . Second , my fingerprints had to be all over Handelman 's apartment ; they 're on file . Last , Handelman had nothing whatsoever to do with any part of the government ; that was his strength . He was a halfway man for the Quai d'Orsay , and they never would have used him if they thought he 'd ever be under government scrutiny . It is n't done ; we 're all off-limits . " " What do you make of it ? " Michael sank back in the booth , reached for his whisky , and drank . " It 's too blatant , " he mused , holding the glass in front of his lips . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to come in  --  presumably after Bradford  --  and take you . " " To a point beyond salvage , ' to coin a phrase . And once I 'm dead , I ca n't talk , but they can explain they trapped a killer . Reaching Bradford would be easy , coming out with him impossible . . . . Unless I could draw him out , make him come to me . " " They 'll never permit it . He 'll be flanked by guards and they 'll be watching for you . They 'll kill you on sight . " Havelock drank again , a thought stirring at the bottom of his mind but as yet unclear . " Watching for me , " he repeated , putting the glass down . " Looking for me . . . But no one 's looking for me except the men who did this to us . " " The liars , as you call them , " said Jenna . " Yes . We need help , but I assumed we could n't get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . That 's not the case now ; they called off the hunt . " " Do n't be foolish , Mikhail , " interrupted Jenna . " It 's part of the trap . There 's an alert out for you as well as for me , and yours is n't coded ; there 's nothing ambiguous about it . You 're you , and every agency that might be  | of value has you on its list . Whom in your government do you think you could trust ? " " No one , " agreed Havelock . " And no one who could survive a beyond salvage ' association , if I did trust him . " " Then what are you saying ? " " Cagnes-sur-Mer , " said Michael , squinting . " At Salanne 's house , when I could n't reach Anton I called old Zelienski  --  I told you , remember ? He mentioned him . Alexander the Great , ' he called him . Raymond Alexander . Not just a mutual friend , but a pretty damned good friend  --  of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How ? " " Because he 's outside the government . Outside but in a way very much a part of it ; Washington needs him and he needs Washington . He 's a writer for The Potomac Review , and knows as much about the government as anyone I 've ever met . But he relies on his contacts ; he 'd never let me get near him if I 'd been identified in the newspapers , but I was n't . " " How could he help us ? " " I 'm not sure . Maybe draw out Bradford for me . He does in-depth interviews , and to be interviewed by him is a plus for anyone in the government . He 's above suspicion . They might drive Bradford out in a tank , but they 'd let him go inside the house by himself . I could hint at something unexpected , a substantive change in the State Department with Bradford at the center . Then suggest an interview  --  with me in the house to listen , to verify . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's part of his mystique . Like James Reston at the Times . If a politician or a bureaucrat says he was at Fiery Run , everyone knows what he means ; there 'll be a story by Scotty Reston . If he says he was out at Fox Hollow , the same people know he was interviewed by Raymond Alexander . Fox Hollow 's in Virginia just west of Washington . We could be there in an hour and a half , two hours at the most . " " Would he do it ? " " He might . I wo n't tell him why , but he might . We 're friends . " " The university ? " " No , but there 's a connection . I met him through Matthias . When I first started at State , Matthias would come down to Washington on one thing or another , building his contacts , charming the asses off influential asses , and I 'd frequently get a hurry-up call from Anton , asking me to join  | them both for dinner . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the restaurants were the kind way beyond my income . " " That was gracious of your pntele . " " And not very bright for a brilliant man , considering the nature of my training . He was the ucitel extolling his not too gifted student from Praha , when the last thing I needed was any sort of notice . I explained this quietly to Alexander . We both laughed and , as a result , had dinner now and then when Anton was safely back in his tower at Princeton , tending his academic gardens and not trying to grow arbors in Washington . Make no mistake , the great Matthias was not above fertilizing the seeds he 'd sown . " You 'd have dinner at Alexander 's home ? " " Always . He understood that he also was n't someone I wanted to be seen with in public . " " Then you are good friends . " " Reasonably so . " " And he 's influential ? " " Of course . " Jenna reached over and touched his arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned and put his hand over hers . " I do n't think he 'd want to hear it . It 's the sort of thing he runs from . " " He 's a writer . In Washington . How can you say that ? " " He 's an analyst , a commentator . Not an investigative reporter , not a muckraker . He does n't like stepping on toes , only on opinions . " " But what you have to tell him is extraordinary . " " He 'd tell me to go straight to the State Department security bureau on the basis that I 'd get a fair hearing . I would n't . I 'd get a bullet in my head . Alexander 's a sixty-five-year-old curmudgeon who 's heard it all ? from Dallas to Watergate  --  and he thinks a hundred and ten percent of it is a conspiracy of horseshit . And if he found out what I 'd done ? Handelman excluded  --  he 'd call security himself . " " He 's not much of a friend . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michael paused , turning her hand over . " But beyond the possibility that he 'd bring Bradford out to Fox Hollow , there 's something he might clear up . My pntel . I 'll ask him to find out where Matthias is , say that I do n't want to call myself because I may not have time to see him and Anton would be upset . He 'd do it ; with his connections he could do it . "  | " Suppose he ca n't ? " " Then that 'll tell us something , wo n't it ? In which case , I 'll force him to get Bradford out there , if I have to put a gun to his head . But if he does reach Matthias at a lodge in the Shenandoah . . . we 'll know something else , and it frightens the hell out of me . It will mean that the Secretary of State has a Moscow connection in the KGB . " The village of Fox Hollow was small . The streets were lit by gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stores were called shops and their clientele was among the wealthiest in the Washington  --  New York orbit . The village 's charm was not only apparent , it was proclaimed , but it was not for the benefit of outsiders  --  tourists were discouraged , if not harassed . The minimum police force had maximum arms and a communications system that proportionately rivaled that of the Pentagon , where it was probably designed . Fox Hollow was an island in a landlocked area of Virginia as surely as if its square mileage were surrounded by an impassable sea . The air had been warmed by the Potomac River , and the snow had receded on the outskirts of Harpers Ferry . It had turned into a cold drizzle at Leesburg , by which time Havelock had prepared his scenario for Raymond Alexander . Its bureaucratic plausibility lent it conviction , plausibility based on genuine anxiety where present or past covert operations were concerned . There had been a killing in New York  --  if Alexander had not heard of it , he would by morning ; he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an impersonation , including an ID and an appearance uncomfortably close to Michael 's own . The State Department had flown him back from London on military transport ; any assistance the retired foreign service officer could give Consular Operations would be appreciated ; also , he had been in London , had n't he ? The Bradford ploy would be refined as their conversation progressed , but the basic thrust would be that the once controversial undersecretary of State was about to be rehabilitated and put back in the limelight . In London , Havelock would say , he had been given a detailed report of Bradford 's extensive but secret negotiations in the touchy matter of NATO missile deployment ; it was a major shift in policy . It was also sufficiently explosive to get Alexander 's juices running . It was the sort of advance leak he thrived on , giving him time to put together an exhaustive analysis of the pros and cons . But if the old warhorse wished to interview Emory Bradford  --  with on-site but unseen verification , possibly confron-  | tation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox Hollow in the morning . Havelock had a reservation on the afternoon flight back to London  --  and , of course , time and schedules permitting , he wanted to drop in on his old mentor Anthony Matthias , if only for a few minutes . If Alexander knew where he could find him . As for Bradford , he had no choice . If summoned by the redoubtable journalist , he would comply . Other things  --  such as Costa Brava  --  might be paramount , but he still had to maintain his low profile at all costs , and one way to lose it was to refuse to be interviewed by Raymond Alexander . And when he came into the house in Fox Hollow , with his guards remaining outside in a limousine , Michael would take him . His disappearance would baffle the liars and the guards hired by the liars . The journalist 's large , rambling house was surrounded by miles of dense woods , overgrown fields and steep ravines . No one knew forests the way Mikhail Havlicek knew them ; he would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , and a car , and the woman that Bradford had used in Barcelona . After his meeting with Alexander , they would have all night to study the map and travel the roads , watching for the Fox Hollow police , explanations at the ready if they were stopped . They could do it . They had to do it . " It 's lovely ! " cried Jenna , charmed by the gas-lit streets and the small alabaster columns of the storefronts . " It 's wired , " said Michael , spotting a blue-and-white patrol car at the curb in the middle of the block . " Get down ! " he ordered . " Stay out of sight . " " What ? " " Please . " Jenna did as she was told , curling up on the floor . He slowed down , pulling alongside the police car ; he saw the officer in the window , then eased to his right , and parked directly in front . " What are you doing ? " whispered Jenna , bewildered . " Showing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very good , Mikhail . " Havelock got out of the coupe and walked back to the patrol car . The police officer rolled down the window , first studying the license plate on Michael 's rented car . It was precisely what Michael wanted him to see ; it could be of value later that night if a " suspicious vehicle " was reported . " Officer , could you tell me where there 's a pay phone around here ? I thought there was one on the corner , but then I have n't been back here in a couple of years . "  | " You 've been here before ? " asked the policeman , his voice friendly , his eyes not . " Oh , sure . Used to spend weekends out here a lot . " " You have business in Fox Hollow , sir ? " " Well ... " Havelock paused , as if the question bordered on impertinence . Then he shrugged , as if to say , After all the police have a job to do . He spoke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . My business is with an old friend , Raymond Alexander . I want to call and tell him I 'm here . . . . Just in case someone 's dropped in on him he 'd prefer I not meet . It 's standard procedure with Mr. Alexander , Officer , but you probably know that . I could drive around for a while . I 'll probably have to later on anyway . The policeman 's posture had visibly improved at the mention of Alexander 's name . Limousines and military staff cars were common sights on the road to the venerated political commentator 's retreat . There was no such vehicle in front of him now , but the operative phrases were printed in the officer 's eyes : " An old friend " ; " Used to spend weekends ... " " Yes , sir . Of course , sir . There 's a restaurant five blocks up with a phone the lobby . " " The Lamplighter ? " said Havelock , remembering . " That 's it . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't there a booth on the street ? " " There 's one over on Acacia . " " If you 'll tell me how to get there , both R.A. and I would appreciate it . " " You can follow me , sir . " " ' Thanks very much . " Michael started for his car , then stopped and returned to the window . " I know this sounds silly , but I was usually driven out here . I think I know the way to his home . I take a left on Webster to Underhill Road , then straight out for two or three miles , is n't that it ? " " It 's nearer six miles , sir . " " Oh ? Thanks . " " After you make your call , I could lead you out , sir . It 's quiet in town tonight . " " ' That 's very kind of you . But really , I could n't ask you . " " No problem . That 's what we 're here for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | The call to Raymond Alexander brought forth the response Havelock expected . Nothing would do but that he drop in and see the journalist if only for a drink . Michael said he was glad Raymond was free , not only to renew an old friendship but because he had learned something in London that Alexander might want to know about . It might even make up partially for a great many expensive dinners Havelock had enjoyed at Raymond 's expense . On the way back to his car from the booth , Michael stopped at the police officer 's window . " Mr. Alexander wanted me to get your name . He 's very grateful to you . " " It 's nothing , sir . My name 's Lewis . Officer Lewis ; there 's only one . " Lewis , he thought . Harry Lewis , professor of political science , Concord University . He could not think about Harry now , but he would have to think about him soon . Lewis must be convinced he had dropped out of civilization . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found and exposed . " Is something the matter , sir ? " " No , nothing at all . I know a man named Lewis . I remembered I was to call him . Thanks once again . I 'll follow you . " Havelock climbed behind the wheel of the rented car and looked at Jenna . " How are you doing ? " " Uncomfortable and frightened out of my mind ! Suppose that man had come over ? " " I would have stopped him , called to him from the booth , but I did n't think it was likely . The police in Fox Hollow stay close to their radios . I just do n't want you seen , if we can help it . Not around here , not with me . " The drive out to Alexander 's house took less than twelve minutes . The white post-and-rail fence marking the journalist 's property shone in the glare of the headlights of both cars . The home itself was set far back from the road . It was a tasteful combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular drive in front of wide slate steps that led to the heavy oak entrance door . The grounds were cleared in the front and on the sides of the house ; thick , tall trees shot up at random about the close-cropped lawn . But where the lawn ended , on either side the dense woods abruptly began . From memory , Michael pictured the rear of the house ; the woods were no farther away from the large back patio than they were from the sides of the building . He would use those woods and Bradford would enter them with him .  | " When you hear the police car leave , " he said to Jenna , " get up and stretch , but do n't get out . I do n't know what kind of alarms Alexander has around here . " " It 's been a strange introduction to this free country of yours , Mikhail . " " Also , do n't smoke . " " De'kuji . " " You 're welcome . " Havelock purposely touched the rim of the horn as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt and short , easily explained . There were no dogs . He walked toward the patrol car in front , hoping the horn would serve its function before he reached the window . It did ; the front door opened and a uniformed maid stood in the frame , looking out . " Hello , Margaret ! " yelled Michael over the hood of the police car . " Be right there . " He looked down at the police officer , who had glanced at the door , the scene not lost on him . " Thanks again , Officer Lewis , " he said , taking a bill from his pocket . " I 'd like to ? " " Oh , no , sir , thanks just the same . Have a good evening , sir . " The officer nodded with a smile , pulled the gear in place , and drove off . Havelock waved ; no police , no dogs , only unseen alarms . As long as Jcnna stayed in the car , she was safe . He walked up the slate steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " said the woman in a distinct Irish brogue . " My name is Enid , not Margaret . " " I 'm terribly sorry . " " Mr. Alexander is expecting you . I never heard of a Margaret ; the girl before me was Gretchen . She lasted four years , may the Lord rest her soul . " Raymond Alexander got up from the soft easy chair in his book-lined , wood-paneled library and walked toward Michael , his hand outstretched . I lis gait was more lively than one might have expected from his portly figure ; his cherubic face with the clear green eyes was topped by a mass of disheveled hair that managed to stay darker than the years normally permitted . In keeping with his anachronistic life-style , he wore a deep red velvet smoking jacket , something Havelock had not seen since his adolescent days in Greenwich , Connecticut . " Michael , how are you ? My God , it 's been four , five years now ! " cried the journalist in his clipped , high-pitched voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look great . " " You do n't ! Forgive me , young man , but you look like something one  | of my cats would have left outside . I do n't think retirement agrees with you . " Alexander released Havelock 's hand and quickly raised both of his own . " Yes , I know all about it . I keep track when friends answer questions . Pour yourself a drink ; you know the rules here and you look like you need one . " I will , thanks , " said Michael , heading for the familiar copper dry-bar against the wall . " I suppose you 'd look better with some sleep .... " It was the opportune opening . Havelock sat down opposite the journalist and told him the story of the killing in New York and State 's flying him back from London at 4:0o A.M. , U.K. time . " I read about that this morning , " said Alexander , shaking his head . " Naturally , I thought of you  --  the name , of course  --  but knew right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with your background ? Did someone steal an old identification of yours ? " " No , it was mocked , that 's what we think . At any rate , it 's been a long two days . For a while I thought I was a prisoner . " " Well , they never would have brought you over this way if Anton had been apprised , I can tell you that . " Only Matthias 's closest friends called him by his Czech first name , and because Michael knew it , the statement alarmed him . By necessity , it reversed the sequence that Havelock had intended , but it would have been unnatural not to inquire . The Bradford ploy would come last ; Matthias now . " I wondered about that , " said Havelock , revolving the glass in his hand , his voice casual . " I simply figured he was too damned busy . As a matter of fact , I was going to ask you if he was in Washington . I 'd like to drop in and see him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to London , and if I call him myself . . . well , you know Anton . He 'd insist I spend a couple of days . " Alexander leaned forward in the heavily cushioned chair , his intelligent face expressing concern . " You do n't know , then ? " " Know what ? " " Damn it , that 's when government paranoia goes too far ! He 's the closest thing you have to a father and you 're the closest thing he has to a son ! You who 've kept the secrets of a thousand operations and they have n't told you . " " Told me what ? " " Anton 's ill . I 'm sorry you have to hear it from me , Michael . "  | " How ill ? " " The rumors range from serious to fatal . Apparently he 's aware of whichever it is , and , true to form , thinks of himself last . When State learned that I 'd found out , he sent me a personal note swearing me to secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of those odd things you do n't really think about . . . until you think about it . I was inveigled into going to a party in Arlington several weeks ago  --  you know how I detest those exhausting exercises in verbal endurance , but the hostess was a close friend of my late wife . " " I 'm sorry , " interrupted Havelock , only vaguely remembering the journalist 's wife , a willowy thing who had opted for gardens and flower arrangements . " I did n't know . " " It 's all right . It 's been over two years now . " " The party in Arlington ? " " Yes , well to my embarrassment a youngish woman who was quite drunk virtually assaulted me . Now , if she 'd been a predatory female intent on a sexual liaison , I could have understood her being drawn to the most desirable man on the premises , but I 'm afraid it was n't the case . Apparently , she had marital difficulties of a most unusual nature . Her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' connubial bed ' ? for nearly three months , and no one at the Pentagon would tell her where he was . She feigned illness , which I doubt took a great deal of selfpersuasion , and he was brought back on emergency leave . When she got him in her net , she demanded to know where he 'd been , what he was doing  --  read other woman . ' He refused to tell her , so when soldier-boy was asleep she went through his clothes and found a security pass for a post she 'd never heard of ; I had n't either , as a matter of fact . I gather she ( uttered him awake and confronted him , and this time in self-defense he blurted out that it was the highest-priority classification . It was where a very important man was being treated , and he could n't say any more . " " Anton ? " broke in Michael . " I did n't piece it together until the next morning . The last thing she said to me  --  before some charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country should be told about such things , that the government was behaving like Mother Russia . That morning she phoned me , quite sober and in serious panic . She apologized for what she described as her ' ghastly behavior ' and pleaded with me to forget everything she 'd told me . I was entirely sympathetic , but added that perhaps her instincts  | were right , although I was n't the person she should appeal to ; there were others who would serve her better . She replied something to the effect that her husband could be ruined , a brilliant military career destroyed . So that was that . " " That was what ? How did you find out it was Matthias ? " " Because that same morning I read in the Washington Post that Anton was prolonging a brief vacation and would not appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . I kept thinking about the woman and what she 'd said . . . and the fact that Anton rarely gave up a chance to perform for the Senate newsreels . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where he spends every free moment he has ? " " The Shenandoah lodge , " interrupted Havelock , feeling a sense of deja vu . " Exactly . I reasoned that if the story was true and he was taking an extra few days , we might get together for some valley fishing or his beloved chess . Like you , again , I have the telephone number , so I called him . " " He was n't there , " said Michael . " They did n't say that , " corrected the journalist . " They said he could n't come to the phone . " " That phone ? " " Yes . . . that phone . It was the private line . " " The one that goes unanswered unless he 's there . " " Yes . " Alexander raised his brandy glass and drank . Havelock was close to screaming . He wanted to rush over to the portly writer and shake him : Go on ! Go on , tell me ! Instead , he said quietly , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it have been to you ? " " Certainly . " It was . Ca n't you see it in my eyes ? " What did you do ? " " The first thing was to call Zelienski . You remember old Leon , do n't you ? Whenever Matthias drove or flew out to the lodge it was standard procedure for Zelienski to be summoned for dinner  --  has been standard for years now . " " Did you reach him ? " " Yes , and he told me a very odd thing . He said he had n't seen Anton in months , that Matthias never answered his calls anymore  --  not personally  --  and that he did n't think our great man had time for the valley these days . " The deja vu was complete for Michael . Then he remembered . " You 're a friend of Zelienski 's , are n't you ? "  | " Through Anton , mainly . Very much the way we met . He comes up now and then for lunch and chess . Never for dinner , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is that the one place where Matthias should have been for a holiday he was n't . I really ca n't imagine his not seeing old Leon , can you ? After all , Zelienski lets him win . " " I ca n't imagine your letting the issue drop , either . " " You 're quite right , I did n't . I called Anton 's office and asked to speak with his first assistant . I emphasized that I expected someone who represented the Secretary of State in his absence , as I considered my inquiry to be that substantive . Of all people , guess who was put on to me . " " Who ? " " Emory Bradford . Do you remember him ? Bradford the boomerang , ' scourge of the warlords where once he 'd been their spokesman . I was fascinated because actually I admire him for having had the courage to reverse himself , but I always thought Matthias detested the whole flock . If anything , he was more sympathetic to those who went down in flames because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradford tell you ? " Michael gripped the glass in his  --  hand , suddenly terrified that he might break it . " You mean , what did he tell me after I told him what I thought had happened ? Naturally , I never mentioned the woman and , God knows , it was n't necessary . Bradford was in shock . He begged me not to say anything or write anything , that Matthias himself would be in touch with me . I agreed , and by midafternoon , I received Anton 's note by messenger . I 've abided by his request  --  until now . I ca n't for a minute believe he 'd want you excluded . " " I do n't know what to say . " Havelock lessened the pressure on the glass , Incat Icing deeply , the moment to be interpreted in any way the journalist wished . But for Michael it was the prelude to the most important question he Wright ever have asked in his life . " Do you remember the name of the post where the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of before ? " " Yes , " said Alexander , studying Havelock . " But no one knows I know . O t my source . " Will you tell me ? No one will ever know my source , you have my word .. n rt . " " For what purpose , Michael ? " I lavelock paused , then smiled . " Send a basket of fruit probably . A letter , of course . "  | The journalist nodded his head , smiled and answered , " It 's a place called Poole 's Island , somewhere off the coast of Georgia . " " Thank you . " Alexander noted his empty glass . " Come now , we 're both out . Freshen yours and do mine while you 're at it . That 's also part of the rules , remem-ber ? " Michael got out of the chair , shaking his head , smiling still , despite the tension he felt . " Be happy to pour yours , but I really have to get going . " He picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ago . " You 're leaving ? " exclaimed the old warhorse , his eyebrows arched , turning in the chair . " What about this piece of information from London you claimed would make up for some of the best meals you ever had , young man ? " Havelock stood at the copper dry-bar , pouring brandy . " I was thinking about that as I drove out here , " he said pensively . " I may have been impetuous . " " Spoilsport , " said Alexander , chuckling . " Well , it 's up to you . It concerns a very complicated , deep-cover intelligence operation , which in my judgment will take us nowhere . Do you want to hear it ? " " Stop there , dear boy ! You 've got the wrong scribbler , I would n't touch it . I subscribe to Anton 's maxim . Eighty percent of all intelligence is a chess game played by idiots for the benefit of paranoid morons ! " Michael climbed into the car ; there was the faint odor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Feeling like a little boy in a graveyard , " replied Jenna , curled up on the floor . " What about Bradford ? Will your friend bring him out here ? " Havelock started the engine , engaged the gear , and swung rapidly around the circular drive toward the entrance . " You can get up now . " " What about Bradford ? " " We 're going to let him sweat for a while , stretch him out . " Jenna crawled up on the seat , staring at him . " What are you saying , Mikhail ? " " We 're going to drive all night , rest for a while in the morning , then keep going . I want to get there late tomorrow . " " My God , where ? " " A place called Poole 's Island , wherever it is. "
