Almost a year has passed since a committee of five Roman Catholic bishops released the first draft of a pastoral letter that denounced the " massive and ugly " failures of the American economy and called for a bold new effort to aid the poor both in the U.S. and abroad . Impassioned and provocative , the document aroused a torrent of reaction that ran to 10,000 pages of comments from Catholics and non-Catholics alike . While many liberals praised the letter as a blueprint for economic justice , conservatives complained that it was an unjustified assault on the foundations of capitalism . <P> Encouraged by the interest stirred and conscious of the criticism , the bishops ' committee sought suggestions for the second draft of their work at hearings held from Wall Street to Appalachia . This week the committee , chaired by Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee , is releasing a revised Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy . It is shorter than the first draft ( about 40,000 words vs. more than 50,000 ) , more tightly reasoned and more generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone or thrust of the bishops ' main message . The new draft , like the first , calls the presence of widespread poverty in the midst of American plenty " a social and moral scandal that must not be ignored . " The document notes that 14.4% of the U.S. population lives below the official poverty line , which , for a family of four , is set at an income level of $10,609 . <P> Weakland 's committee paid particular attention to positive responses from $ other bishops at last June 's meeting of the 280-member National Conference of Catholic Bishops . One bishop , typifying the group 's general support for the pastoral letter , told its authors , " Right on ! Tighten it up . Do n't back off . " The letter will be revised once more before being submitted to the National Conference for final approval in November 1986 . <P> Weakland and his colleagues did drop one of their most questionable recommendations : a call for reduction of the U.S. unemployment rate , which now stands at 7.1% , to the 3% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unrealistic and that Government efforts to reach it would fan inflation . While the new draft deems the current jobless rate " morally unacceptable " and calls for expanded Government programs , including greater retraining efforts , the bishops no longer set an unemployment target . <P> Another change resulted from concern that the first draft ignored the legitimate feelings of middle-class citizens who resent having part of their earnings transferred to the poor through taxes and social spending . The revised letter contains new passages noting that " many working people and middle-class Americans live dangerously close to poverty . " The bishops made it clear that they do not seek a radical redistribution of income from the middle class to the poor . Instead , they primarily advocate higher taxes on the wealthy .
