Baghiti Khumalo ' s moment in the spotlight came nightly during Paul Simon ' s " Graceland " tour . Amid the punchy horns and driving percussion of Mr. Simon ' s joyous hit " You Can Call Me Al , " the band suddenly stopped and Mr. Khumalo filled two bars with a furious bass guitar solo . As the band again kicked in , a wide smile would crease his face . Mr. Khumalo has been smiling a lot lately . Through Mr. Simon ' s Grammy-winning album and the five-month , 10-country " Graceland " tour that ended earlier this week , the squat 30-year-old Soweto native has gotten what he deserves : international recognition for his crisp , inventive bass playing . In South Africa , Mr. Khumalo is perhaps the most acknowledged electric bassist , having played countless recording dates and in several top electronic jazz and exuberant " township jive " bands . ( Mr. Simon sought Mr. Khumalo after hearing the bassist on a record by the South African group Tao Ea Matsekha . ) He and his 26-year-old brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African jazz/rock aggregate that features Mr. Khumalo ' s bass as its lead instrument . The easygoing Mr. Khumalo has been playing bass since his teens . " When I was a child I built a one-string guitar for myself , " he remembers , " and played it every day . My mother saw I was serious and bought me a six-string . " Among the early tunes he learned to play was Mr. Simon ' s 1971 hit , " Mother and Child Reunion , " a top seller in South Africa . He switched to the electric bass when he joined his first band and , he says , " spent the next few years hustling to get a sound . " Listening to as many bassists as he could find , Mr. Khumalo fell for the style of Jaco Pastorius , best known as a key member of the group Weather Report . Mr. Pastorius , who today runs his own big band , usually employs a fretless bass that permits him to slide between tones , thus replacing the typical note-by-note underpinnings with a sound that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like , oh man , " Mr. Khumalo laughs . " His playing was really hot and challenging . I had to go after it . " Mr. Khumalo bought a fretless bass and went north to Zululand for what turned out to be 18 months of steady performing . " I was free and away from home , playing to good audiences in schools and halls every night , " he says . The steady work enabled him to develop his sound , a cross between Mr. Pastorius ' s colorful playing and a thundering rumble all his own . " It was the best experience for me . " Offers to free-lance followed his return to Soweto . Among the studio dates Mr. Khumalo accepted was the one with Tao Ea Matsekha , a Lesotho group whose music showcases bass . The finished product caught the ear of Hilton Rosenthal , a Johannesburg record producer , and in late 1984 he passed it along to Mr. Simon , who had begun to tinker with the idea of recording with South African musicians . Mr. Simon liked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording band , reworked the Tao Ea Matsekha version and came up with " The Boy in the Bubble , " the opening track of " Graceland . " Mr. Khumalo ' s bass playing dominates the song . In all , Mr. Khumalo appears on five tracks on " Graceland . " " I knew this was a big chance for me , " Mr. Khumalo says . " I thought now maybe people will get to see what I can play . " The album also gave Mr. Khumalo reason for his first trip to America . In May 1986 , Mr. Simon brought him , guitarist Ray Phiri and drummer Isaac Mtshali to New York . The South Africans spent two weeks in Manhattan , visiting nightclubs , performing at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem , meeting New York musicians , including , to Mr. Khumalo ' s delight , bassists Anthony Jackson and Darryl Jones . They also played with Mr. Simon on NBC ' s " Saturday Night Live " and recorded the basic tracks for " You Can Call Me Al " and " Diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The session for " You Can Call Me Al " was held at the Hit Factory recording studio on Mr. Khumalo ' s birthday . " I don ' t know what Paul intended to do with that space , " he says of the two-bar solo he ' s since made his own , " but I said I must have it . Paul said ' Go for it ' and I did . " Mr. Simon also opened a spot for Mr. Khumalo ' s lyrical playing on " Diamonds " as well . When Mr. Simon put together his touring troupe , he selected Mr. Khumalo as well as Mr. Phiri ' s band , Stimela . It ' s been the big break of a young career . Mr. Simon , who shared the bill with exiled South Africans Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masakela , gave Mr. Khumalo plenty of opportunity to demonstrate his facile playing . The bassist made the most of his forum , and the audience , without exception , responded to his effort . " I am very surprised at the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I am shocked . I never expected it here . But everywhere we ' re playing the people go crazy . It ' s something . " With the end of the " Graceland " tour , Mr. Khumalo will return to his wife and their nine-month-old son in Soweto . But his appetite for the U.S. music scene has been whetted ; he ' ll be back later this year to play with Mr. Masakela . He wouldn ' t mind bringing his family , including his brother , with him . " I now feel very comfortable in the U.S. , " he says . " New York is like home . It ' s a good town for music . I love the guys , all the many kinds of music . I ' d like to see if me and my brother can make it here . That would be great.
