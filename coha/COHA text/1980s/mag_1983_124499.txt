For the record , no boat in the 75-year history of the Los Angeles to Honolulu yacht race has ever reported being assaulted by a whale . But if such an encounter were to occur , some boats would stand a better chance of surviving than others . The speediest of today 's entrants , most of which are built of fiber glass , probably would n't have a prayer . But were a whale to bully Natoma , a 58-foot ketch with a cold-molded spruce hull 1 inches thick , that whale might find it had bitten off more than it could chew . Natoma is a noble craft . // Christened in 1975 , Natoma was one of the last boats designed by the esteemed naval architect Phil Rhodes , who died without seeing her sail . Her owner and skipper , Donald B. Dalziel , had commissioned Rhodes to build a fast ocean cruiser that would be comfortable and durable , and Dalziel got what he wanted . He named the boat after a street in San Francisco . " I looked up while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the corner , " he says . " A beautiful name ! We subsequently found out there was an operetta called Natoma , and it was a flop . An absolute flop ! But out of it came one song everybody knows : The Dagger Dance . " Dalziel does a little dagger dance : " Da-da-da-daaa .... " // Natoma , which sails out of the St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco , has had a romantic and colorful career . She has scored her share of firsts in short-course competition in San Francisco Bay and local offshore races , and there have been some good dinner parties on board  --  Dalziel enjoys dinner parties , especially if there are costumes or favors . There has also been a lovely wedding on board , and there were two nice funerals . One was for John Murphy , who had raced to Honolulu with Natoma and had left instructions that his ashes be scattered under the Golden Gate Bridge from her deck . They were . // Natoma 's first race was the 1975 Transpac , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is known , and she came in sixth among 15 boats in Class A. One week later she raced some Transpac boats from Honolulu to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and set a record that still stands . " It was sailed in stormy conditions , and we just flew , " says Dalziel. // The next year Natoma was first to finish ( after 21 days ) in the LA. - to- Tahiti race . True , there were only four boats in the race , but then it 's such a tough race that they were the only boats willing to tackle the 3,700-mile ocean crossing . Natoma finished ninth in Class A in the ' 77 Transpac , and in ' 79 , the year the wind vanished for a week  --  that race came to be called the Great Pacific Parking Lot  --  she finished third in Class A , demonstrating her versatility . " I 've never been in a race with this boat where my crew and I were n't ready to go on after the finish , " Dalziel says . " Just restock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only on the part of Natoma 's crews but also her opponents , is that she is n't a bad racer for a luxury liner . // The 1981 Transpac was more than a race for Natoma . It was the first leg of a 13-month voyage from San Francisco to New Zealand and back . She would continue sailing southwest after the race and make port calls in Pago Pago , Samoa and the Fijis before reaching Auckland in October . She would return to the U.S. the following summer via Tahiti , the Tuamotus and the Marquesas , but would not enter the ' 83 Transpac. // In 1929 , when he was 18 , Dalziel shipped out with the merchant marine as an ordinary seaman . In five years with the Dollar Steamship Line he made half a dozen trans-Pacific voyages and two trips around the world , visiting places like Alexandria , Singapore and Shanghai . Dalziel 's zest for adventure has diminished little in the half century since ; if it has changed at all , it has merely evolved into an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 on May 26 , speaks in exclamation points and gestures as if he were drawing them in the air . There 's a watery film over his eyes and the lids have grown puffy , but for one who has spent so much time squinting to windward , there are few crow's-feet . After a lifetime of squeezing his 6 ' 1 " frame through hatches and passageways , he seems to be perpetually ducking . He has a narrow white mustache trimmed to a mere stubble and silky white hair that blows when he 's at the helm of Natoma. // He thinks nothing of changing sails in a heaving sea or stumbling onto a slick and heaving deck in the middle of the night . " I like it when the bow dips down into the water , like a knife scooping up frosting , " he says . // Dalziel is notorious among West Coast ocean racers for his public wassailing with his crew members , some of them teen-agers . In restaurants he 's a patriarch whose leadership is somewhat loose . He has faced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing after dinner against the wishes of the establishment . He says he would have liked the dancing to have been on the tables . // His reputation as a skipper is also well established . Other Transpac sailors do n't know exactly what goes on aboard Natoma during a race , but they see the results : respectable placings and an unmatched spirit . They realize Natoma must have a special skipper . His philosophy of sailing in general and the Transpac in particular is simple : " If you have a good boat and a good crew , you 'll have a good time . " That 's much easier said than done for most , but after 54 years as a seaman , Dalziel has it wired . // 1245 hours , July 3 , 1981 , off Point Fermin , San Pedro , Calif . It 's 15 minutes before the start of the Transpac , and 74 yachts are milling about near the line . Boats are cutting and weaving , tacking and jibing at close quarters in a 20-knot wind . There are craft with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuia ; with magical names , like Merlin and Oz and Moonshadow ; with bold names , like Jubilation and Temerity , Audacious and Regardless ; and with names that might be personalized license plates , e.g. , Sumark . The hulls are long and short and sleek and bulky , fiber glass painted brightly , wood varnished darkly . And the boats are all trying to be in approximately the same spot at the same time . // " This is our approach ! " shouts Captain Dalziel in his raspy voice as he mans Natoma 's helm . " We 're approaching ! " It 's just two minutes and 15 seconds before the start , and Natoma is in good position . The 36-foot sloop Gryphon is heading toward her off the port bow , but Natoma is on starboard tack and has right of way . Gryphon keeps coming . A Natoma crewman shouts an alarm from the foredeck , but Gryphon veers too late . The boats ' hulls come within feet of each other , and when Gryphon enters Natoma 's windshadow , she straightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a steely sprooinngg and a long clamor of aluminum . // It 's no contest . " Well , he 's out , " says Jean Armstrong , the captain 's daughter . Gryphon 's mast has toppled ; her sail has dropped like a collapsed tent . One bewildered crewman kneels on the aft deck and looks forlornly toward Natoma as she speeds off undaunted toward Hawaii . // " One forty-five before the start , " says Armstrong . // Natoma crosses the starting line at full speed , just seconds after the gun , the best start she has ever gotten in a Transpac . Close off her starboard beam is Christine , an owner-built 84-foot sloop expected to challenge the two fastest boats , Drifter , which finished first in 1979 , and Merlin , which holds the race record of eight days , 11 hours , one minute and 45 seconds . By sunset , Christine will have drawn away from Natoma and disappeared over the horizon , while Natoma , beating toward Catalina Island at her nine-knot hull speed , will have separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the northwest tip of the island that evening and hook south for the run to Honolulu . // Until the Transpac boats broke into the northeast trade winds , the seas were choppy . Natoma reached all that first night , blown by 15-knot winds . It was a long night for Michael Yarnold , 39 , Natoma 's mate and the only professional sailor on the crew ; he was employed full time by Dalziel to maintain the ketch . Yarnold has been sailing since he was 14 . He has a walrus mustache that droops with ocean spray and makes him look like Teddy Roosevelt . Storms at sea lure Yarnold on deck and draw a salty exuberance from him . // Twelve days earlier , when he left San Francisco on Natoma , Yarnold knew it would be more than a year before he 'd return , because he planned to stay with the boat through the winter in Auckland . " I got into sailing because you always end up in a different place , " he says , looking as if he thinks it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which not all the moves have been smart . // Yarnold 's night was long because he spent part of it crawling in the bilges , drawn there by an ominous sloshing sound . He came back up with bad news : One of the two 100-gallon water tanks was leaking . This did n't constitute a crisis  --  the leak was n't that severe  --  but at breakfast the captain announced there would be short water rations ; no hot coffee for the night watches would be the worst of it . // Every morning the escort vessel , Jubilee , held a radio roll call , and within minutes after all competitors had reported their positions , a computer on board Jubilee would determine the standings on the basis of projected finishing times , including each boat 's handicap . After the first night , Natoma was third out of 23 boats in Class A and 13th in fleet . " If we could stay at this point of sail with this wind , we 'd win it , " said George Freyermuth , the navigator . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . " // There was only one boat in view that afternoon , and she was miles astern of Natoma , her orange sail bobbing in and out of view behind the swells . Soon it would be out of sight , and no other boats would be visible for nine days . By evening Natoma 's only company was three dolphins , which swam circles around her . The captain played the tape of an operetta , and Yarnold , who calls himself the " marine maintenance man , " celebrated the Fourth of July by lobbing a cherry bomb enclosed in a coffee can over the side like a depth charge . // The ' 81 Transpac soon turned into a rough race . The second night out , Drifter , surfing down swells with Merlin and Christine at up to 20 knots , dropped her skeg and was forced to limp back to the mainland , out of the race . // But the most provocative report from Jubilee came on the first morning and concerned the plight of Chat d'Eau , a catamaran competing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transpacific Yacht Club excluded multi-hulls from its race , having deemed them too flimsy for a transoceanic competition , had decided to stage their own race to Honolulu . Starting near Point Fermin at the same time as the official Transpac entrants , the multihull sailors intended to prove their boats as seaworthy as  --  and faster than  --  monohulls over a long haul . Chat d'Eau failed the seaworthiness part of the test . " We were sailing away sweet as can be , only on the mainsail , when the right pontoon lifted over a swell and just fell off , " Skipper Mike Leneman said afterward . " Fifteen seconds later we were all in the water . " // Chat d'Eau 's crewmen stood atop the wreckage of their craft in the cold Pacific in the middle of the night more than 200 miles from land . Their emergency strobe lights were spotted by Westward , a Transpac boat , and within 45 minutes the crew was safe . Now carrying 14 , Westward continued to Hawaii , arriving to a grand reception . // In just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight knots . In those two days her crew of 12 struggled through more than a dozen sail changes to squeeze out maximum speed . Natoma carried 22 sails  --  genoas , bloopers , spinnakers , fore staysails , mainsails and mizzens . With her two masts , she could fly five sails at once if need be . There were more combinations than anyone cared to calculate , and finding the best sails for the situation was an unending task that demanded strenuous effort by the crew . The wind could be infuriatingly capricious , shifting faster than the sails could be changed . On one morning there were five sail changes in one hour . The fine-tuning was constant . The change of a sail often gained only seconds  --  sometimes not even that  --  and it was tempting to think of those seconds as insignificant over a 10- or 12-day period . But hard sailing had to be done , for this was a race . // The very idea of being carried across something so vast and deadly as an ocean in a tub propelled only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort merely in the progress made , however slow it might be . In truth , a relay team could run to Honolulu in less time than it takes the fastest Transpac boat to sail there . It 's 2,225 nautical miles , or 2,560 statute miles , along the rhumb line from Point Fermin to Diamond Head ; 2,560 athletes each running a four-minute mile would best Merlin 's record by 32 hours . Even 97.7 fast marathoners could come close to breaking the record . // Such hypothetical notions give definition to the Pacific Ocean 's vastness . It is huge , but it 's also finite ; you know there is a boundary 10 days over the horizon . The horizon represents permanence : Your challenge does n't get any bigger than that . You know where you stand , even if it is only a delusion . It makes the ocean seem almost cozy . // But about the time you 've come to that conclusion , the sea will usually rise up like that silly shark in Jaws and take a bite out of your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squall or a rogue wave . It might strike in the middle of the night , when the sea is at its most frightening , and inflict a quick knockdown . The boat will heave and tilt and shudder , and the mast may even be dragged underwater . After the squall or wave passes or some brave crewman takes in the sails it 's back to normal , just like that . But afterward the feeling of coziness is diminished . // When sail changes were , necessary on Natoma , Brad Armstrong , no kin of Jean 's , was usually first to the chore . Armstrong , who celebrated his 25th birthday on the eighth day out , kept a sharp eye on the sails , always looking for more speed . The first footfalls heard on deck after a knockdown were often Armstrong 's . On the morning of July 5 , he was hoisted to the top of the 72-foot mainmast to retrieve the end of a halyard that had parted . The light from the rising sun made his body a swaying silhouette against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liveliest time in Natoma 's cabin  --  Armstrong blithely ordered a hero 's breakfast : huevos rancheros with hot sauce , a shot of tequila and an ice-cold beer  --  none of which was available on Natoma . " The crew 's getting spoiled ! " shouted Dalziel in mock dismay . " The cooking 's too good ! If all they ever got was mush three times a day , they 'd probably love it . " // The captain was certainly right about the crew 's eating well . Jean Armstrong and Kathy Walker , the only women aboard , ran the galley . They alternated days on watch , both standing stints at the helm as well as at the stove , but they lacked the muscle to control the boat when the seas were heavy , so most of the time one or both could be found at the gimbaled stove , sometimes literally strapped to the adjacent bulkhead. // Armstrong and Walker had to be more than excellent cooks able to turn leftovers into minestrone ; they had to be attitude adjusters as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Natoma 's heart . The crew mixed there , and , Natoma 's nobility notwithstanding , the way the crew mixed was what gave this vessel so much style . Armstrong and Walker took it upon themselves to ensure that the atmosphere in the cabin was congenial ; they put themselves above moodiness . By so doing , they pulled the others up with them . // Posted in the cabin were the Ship 's Rules , written by Dalziel . Rule No. 1 , lettered in block capitals , was NO BICKERING . The Natoma philosophy recognized that no bickering is no breeze . In observance of the spirit of the rule , six dinner parties were held on Natoma during her 11 nights at sea , each one celebrating an actual occasion . On the evening of July 6 , it was Jean Armstrong 's 36th birthday party . // Natoma 's crew members are fond of saying they may not win every race , but they never lose a party . The flippancy contained in that phrase belies their seriousness about sailing , though it accurately reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the dinner during which race instructions were given , two nights before the start , in Los Angeles ' Biltmore Hotel ballroom , Natoma 's table looked like a scene from Animal House Goes to Sea . The maitre d ' finally came to the table to confiscate the butter and demanded to know the identity of the skipper . Dalziel pointed at Yarnold , who pointed at the crewman next to him , and so on . Only Walker was n't indicted ; how could she be ? She was crawling around under the table . // Whatever the Natoma image ashore , her crew is known for good seamanship . The 1981 crew had a total of 44 Transpac races to its credit , the Dalziel family accounting for 17 of them . The captain had eight , Jean Armstrong three , and her brother , Alec , six . Alec , 42 , owns and operates the family 's San Francisco plumbing supply business , which was founded by the captain 's grandfather . Altogether , the captain 's family consists of four daughters , two sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , who would meet Natoma in Hawaii for the sail to New Zealand . " All good sailors , every one of them , " Dalziel says . // The most conscientious crewman  --  the rest of the crew would vote him rookie of the year  --  was Jim Jervis , 47 , a chemical company executive on his first Transpac . Called Bruto by Yarnold because of his brawn , Jervis was also gentle , and he spoke with an occasional stammer . When he was on watch , his brow was usually covered with perspiration from the exertion of doing whatever needed to be done ; off watch he could be found with an awl in his big hands , making a twine key chain for each crew member . He had brought along 11 stainless-steel tags engraved with NATOMA on one side and TRANSPAC ' 81 on the other . His thoughtfulness said as much about Natoma 's atmosphere as the Biltmore food fight . // On the morning of July 7 , Natoma 's fifth day at sea , the port watch rose to the odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overture . Jubilee 's computer made Natoma fourth in class , a good recovery after having slipped to a 14th-place standing the day before . That alone would have made it a good morning ; the warm sun made it even better . Four sails strained in the 15-knot wind , the blue blooper billowing into a curve shaped like a boomerang . Bob Dietrich , 36 , an architect , Ted Kraus , 22 , a college student , and Ron Raddatz , 42 , a bank vice-president , hopped naked and sudsy on the foredeck , pouring buckets of seawater over one another . Walker sewed a patch on a spinnaker that had torn during a knockdown the night before and knew that only Yarnold could have put the lemons in her bikini top as it hung drying in the head during the night . // That afternoon Natoma became a 43,500-pound surfboard . Eight ' and 10-foot swells surrounded her , long windrows of cobalt-blue water steep as a San Francisco street , some of them breaking on top . Natoma would catch a crest and ride it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung out in the cockpit , spotting the big swells , some of which rose high over their heads behind the boat . They took turns steering and shouting encouragement to each other : " Yeah ! There it is ! Hit it ! You got it ! " Then they would watch the knot meter climb to nine , 10 , 11 and more as Natoma schussed down the face of the wave , her bow dipping into the water like a knife scooping up frosting . And when one wave had passed , she would heave and writhe to the top of another . For hours , Natoma was on a roller-coaster ride across the ocean . // The captain , too , would join the whooping in the cockpit ; in fact , he often started it . " Look at that ! " he shouted one afternoon , steering Natoma down a wave and taking one hand off the wheel to point at the knot meter . " Look at that ! 13 ! The fastest yet ! This thing feels like a freight train : Whoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , Dalziel took on the color of poached salmon . At the helm he wore an old fishing hat pulled down so tight against the wind that it squashed the tops of his ears . It made him look comical , but he could n't have cared less . He would lean sideways to see around the mainsail and throw his head back like a caroler in full song . He wore a look of complete contentment at such moments , like an old dog getting scratched behind the ears . // The captain was capable of being as crotchety as an old dog , too , especially over dominoes . The stakes were dime a point and dollar a game , and he kept a book on everyone , like a rabid baseball fan who compiles his own stats . And he sometimes bent his own no-bickering rule at the domino table , his voice , raspy under any circumstances , becoming harsh and unpleasant . But the crew knew to whom they owed their presence aboard , and if the man wanted to be cranky about dominoes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 1730 hours , July 9 , more than six days and 1,295 miles from California . Natoma nears the point on the globe farther from land than any other . It 's the daily Happy Hour , and soon the halfway-there dinner will be served . The entire crew is gathered in the cockpit . Smoked oysters and pat on crackers are passed around on a tray , and a bottle of California chardonnay is emptied into 12 plastic cups . There 's dancing in the cockpit to Hawaiian music , despite the shortage of women . At the helm Alec Dalziel is wearing a tuxedo , complete with cummerbund ; the rest of the crew is attired in equally bizarre fashion , most notably Yarnold , who sports a gray pinstripe three-piece suit and hair slicked back with grease . His eyes are covered by a pair of magenta New Wave shades . And the boat 's speed never drops below eight knots . // According to the reports from Jubilee , Natoma improved her position to second in class on the seventh day , which was a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , but not that strong . They had n't expected to be leading all those all-out racing yachts  --  ultralight displacement boats , or ULDBs , as they are called  --  especially the seven hot-surfing Santa Cruz 50s , foreshortened clones of the sleek 67-foot Merlin . In fact , Natoma 's standing kept Freyermuth awake at night . Every day he cautioned the crew against false optimism . Freyermuth usually used celestial navigation to calculate their position , but the previous day and this one were too cloudy for him to get a fix on the sun with his sextant . So he had to resort to dead reckoning , or plotting Natoma 's position on the basis of her speed and direction , a method that leaves room for error  --  especially when a boat is surfing . Furthermore , one of his hand-held calculators had begun telling him unbelievable things . ( When Natoma reached Hawaii , Freyermuth called the calculator company . They told him that calculators wear out , just like people , and that five years ' service was all they were designed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) On the eighth day , reality  --  and the Santa Cruz 50s  --  caught up with Natoma : She was in 10th place in class . Freyermuth slept better now . He 'd suspected all along that the second-place calculation had been incorrect , and he 'd felt bad that his report to Jubilee had been imprecise because of the vagaries of electronics and dead reckoning . " I knew it was too good to be true , " said Brad Armstrong . " Well , we just have to take it on the chin today , " said Dalziel. // Freyermuth , a widower who lives alone in San Francisco , was an executive with Standard Oil ( New Jersey ) until 1959 , when he left to go into the consulting business . He had sailed his first Transpac in 1965 , entering a boat that year in what amounted to a college graduation gift to his son , Reed . The crew consisted of four of Reed 's classmates , and they sailed on Freyermuth 's 38-foot sloop , Mistress II . // " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Freyermuth recalls . " I bought a sextant and a couple of books on celestial navigation and we sailed off . How my poor wife ever endured it , I 'll never know . There went her husband and her only son off across the ocean , and neither one of them knew what he was doing . " // They finished 44th out of 54 boats , but Freyermuth had discovered the stars . " In the last 15 years celestial navigation has become more than a hobby to me , " he says . " It 's a fascinating study . A sailing yacht is the last bastion of celestial navigation . " // Aboard Natoma Freyermuth made only infrequent forays away from his navigation nook , squeezed against a bulkhead between the main saloon and the forward head . When he made an appearance on deck , he invariably carried his sextant . Meals were cooked around him , naps were taken around him , domino games were played around him . His bunk seemed always empty  --  or occupied by someone else . He stood no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did . He labored endlessly at night , poring over his charts with a cup of cold coffee at his elbow , the hazy light from the small fluorescent tube turning his stubble of silver whiskers and tousled hair a bluish color . He usually retired long after the cabin lights went out , and by dawn his bunk would be empty again . He would jump out of bed before daybreak to take a sextant reading after the horizon became visible and before the stars faded . // Freyermuth planned to stay with Natoma to guide her on her odyssey to the South Pacific and back . Just as navigation has become more than a hobby to him , so Natoma has become more than a boat . " I 've become attached to her , " he explained , then went on to muse on the ironies of growing old . " It 's funny , it all seems out of proportion . There 's got to be a mistake somewhere . It 's funny how everyone gets older and changes but you . " // The ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . A tropic bird hovered over the mainsail , more than 600 miles from home , if Hawaii was its home . By noon Natoma had slowed to six knots , and four sails were flying , whooshing in the gusts like leaves in tree-tops . The spinnaker looked as sheer as gossamer when the bright sun shone through it . Only blue sky surrounded it . The day was so inviting it even drew Freyermuth on deck for a while ; he rose from the companionway squinting like a prisoner just let out of solitary and walked on wobbly legs white as coconut meat . // The crew members were off watch sunbathing , lounging on nylon sail bags . The shadows from the sails swayed across the pages of the books they read , tales of adventure and faraway places : Tai-Pan , Manchu , Shibumi , Far Tortuga , East of Eden ( what could be more faraway ? ) , and the captain 's choice , Command a King 's Ship , in which , according to the jacket blurb , " iron shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // The balmy weather was wonderful to relax in , but it was n't getting Natoma to Honolulu ; more wind was needed , so the captain ordered the crew to jibe and head farther south to begin the race 's final leg . The crew felt relief  --  and maybe delight  --  when the sky turned red that night . The sea was black to the horizon , where lumpy pink clouds fit together like pieces in a puzzle . Other clouds fanned skyward in ashen streaks . // The wind picked up to 18 knots that night , and Natoma sped at nearly nine knots straight into the moon , which lay a silvery highway on the sea for her . The waves were confused , because the wind had changed direction , and the swells came at Natoma from odd angles . The moonlight created deceptive shadows in the seas , umbras that spooked the helmsmen . The bright stars bobbed as if yanked on strings ; the flapping blooper seemed wraithlike , and a quiet wail came from the mainsail .

With Natoma on a port tack for the first time since the beginning of the race , the lee bunks now became weather bunks ; those crewmen who had been rolled securely into their pillows for eight nights now felt how the other half had been living , and they had to put up barriers to avoid falling out of bed . One crewman dreamed he was on a flying trapeze over Manhattan . // It was a noisy night ; things that had taken nine days to settle into place on starboard tack were now desperately rearranging themselves , giving rise to visions of a dresser being pushed across a floor ; rats gnawing on bedposts ; walnuts dropping into plastic buckets ; a tin can being kicked down the street . // At breakfast the crew wore the look of fatigue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this , the 10th day , squalls began stalking the boat .

After dark , they became phantoms. // Shortly before daybreak the next morning , a squall caught Natoma from behind . The wind shot from 18 to 40 knots with no warning . The spinnaker bulged with air and pulled Natoma faster and faster , until she was out of control and moving at 16 knots ; then it tossed her on her side . Natoma protested , a long soulful groan from the stressed wood . A drawer flew open and fired a Top-Sider across the cabin ; a wayward cantaloupe rolled from the galley ; Freyermuth 's brass divider and pencils scattered on the cabin sole , followed by the navigator himself , who was thrown out of his nook with a thud and slid into the stove . // Yarnold and Armstrong released the spinnaker sheets and then scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squall passed as swiftly as it had struck , and Natoma rocked upright . At the helm was Gordon Hargreaves , 46 , the port watch captain , on his third Transpac with Natoma , and the crew thanked their stars that there had been experience at the helm . " The boom must have been in the water this time , " said Yarnold , " because I was walking on the portholes , and I ca n't normally do that . " // It was the final knockdown for Natoma in the ' 81 Transpac . By 1300 that afternoon , July 13 , she was a tropical 236-mile sail from Diamond Head . The sun glared white on deck as Yarnold listened to a Joni Mitchell record broadcast from a Honolulu radio station and the finals of the domino tournament could be heard in the cabin . Things slowed down to such an indolent pace that even Freyermuth came up on deck again , for ... if not for some sun , at least to lie in the shade of a lighter-weight spinnaker that had been hoisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 years ' worth of things to think about  --  probably the future rather than the past . // Twenty-four hours later , at 1322 on July 14 , Natoma crossed the finish line 11th in Class A and 40th in fleet on corrected time . Her elapsed time was 11 days , three hours , 22 minutes and four seconds . The boat was met by a couple of wandering windsurfers and two cabin cruisers manned by Natoma 's official hosts in Honolulu , who threw bottles of champagne and beer to the crew with abandon , undiscouraged by the bottles that missed and sank with a glug . // Merlin , as expected , was first to finish ; she had reached Diamond Head at about the same time the squalls were stalking Natoma . Her elapsed time was eight days , 11 hours , two minutes and 31 seconds , only 46 seconds shy of her record . Which seemingly would prove that the ocean 's waves never change , but merely rotate around the globe like a roll on a player piano . And that hard sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was Sweet Okole , a 36-foot Class D boat with a 90-hour handicap . Battered , jury-rigged boats straggled into Honolulu for days after Natoma finished . // Although not her best placing , it was Natoma 's fastest Transpac , and it was a respectable showing , not bad for a luxury liner . And as the captain had promised , she was ready to go on after the finish . Freyermuth , Yarnold , Brad Armstrong and Kraus would join the Dalziels on their journey through the South Seas to New Zealand ; the others had banks or machine shops or spouses pulling them back to the mainland . But they would have liked to go on . // At the victory banquet each boat 's skipper was called up to receive a plaque . When the captain left Natoma 's table , his crew sneaked down the aisle behind him and crouched at the foot of the stage .
