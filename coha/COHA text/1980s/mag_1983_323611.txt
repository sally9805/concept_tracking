Twelve new records celebrate Jerry Lee Lewis ' glory days <P> He knows what he is . " I 'm a rompin ' , stompin ' , piano-playin ' son of a bitch . A mean son of a bitch . But a great son of a bitch . " Here 's to you , then , Jerry Lee Lewis , unreconstructed rocker and mean-mouthed , sweet-souled Louisiana country singer . A new twelve-album set , Jerry Lee Lewis : The Sun Years , covers the glory years from 1956 to 1963 and is assembled with the kind of reverence and archival zeal usually reserved for the cantatas of a J.S. Bach . The collection , sold in this country for under $100 , is marketed by Charly Records Ltd. of London . <P> Not even Elvis , whose long and mighty shadow so often shaded Jerry Lee , has ever been so honored . Presley records have become fairly random collections of ill-assorted tracks . Albert Goldman 's 1981 biographical pillaging gut-shot the King on the first page and left him to bleed for 590 more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hellacious , has lucked into a much better deal . Two years ago , Nick Tosches wrote a definitive rock biography , Hellfire , that plunged right to the glowing white heart of Lewis ' Pentecostal furies and set down forever all of Jerry Lee 's unassuaged demons . Now come these records , 209 cuts in all , and each a great ball of fire . <P> Rock has produced a few top piano thumpers - Fats Domino , Huey Smith - but none burned with the passion of Jerry Lewis . Sam Phillips , who had started Sun Records in Memphis , sold the contract of his major star , Elvis Presley , to RCA in 1955 for the then unheard-of sum , for a new singer , of $35,000 , and he was shopping around for a replacement . Jerry Lee , 21 , looked like just the boy . Nicknamed the Killer , to his perpetual displeasure , Lewis sang country , which was not then considered commercially lot . But he also played mean boogie-woogie . He would sit down on the edge of the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from practicing when he had a Broken hip . He would whip up a heavy rhythm with his left hand and play such a furious melody with his right that the tune would beg for mercy . The sound was backwoods , roadhouse . Phillips listened to all of ten seconds of Lewis ' audition tape of Crazy Arms . " I can sell that , " he said . <P> That tape instantly became Lewis ' first single . Crazy Arms kicks off The Sun Years , along with End of the Road , which contains the spooky , defiant and haunting lines " Well , the way is dark , / Night is long , / I do n't care if I never get home ! / I 'm waitin ' at the end of the road ! " The new albums contain 57 songs originally issued on Sun , as well as seven others , initially slicked up with overdubbing , heard here " raw " ; 77 more tracks , released pretty much at random after the Sun catalogue was sold in 1969 , are presented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes of songs like Great Balls of Fire and Whole Lotta Shakin ' Goin ' On , and eight cuts never released before , including a lubricious version of the Pat Boone groaner , Love Letters in the Sand .
