A good place to begin is the Clocktower , with three exhibitions put together by the Women ' s Caucus for Art , a national organization of women artists and art historians . The caucus has also compiled a list of 77 current shows by women artists , featured on its poster , which is on view at Clocktower. // You might first visit " Progressions : Cultural Legacy , " a tribute to pioneering black women artists and their descendants . Photographs of these pioneers and their work , beginning with Annie E. Walker , a 19th-century painter and student of Thomas Eakins , recognize painting and sculpture created in the 19th century by women whose names were never known or have largely been forgotten . A different sort of reality stares out at the viewer with " Now You Have Touched the Women , " a boldly conceived quilt by Faith Ringgold . Like " Sojourner : To Cross the Seas and Live in a Land of Strangers , " a caucus exhibition at the Aaron Davis Hall at City College , " Progressions " celebrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an absorbing exhibition of work in all media that uses a wide range of forms of communication , from Braille configurations to letters and faded clippings . The art is small-scaled but intensely evocative . Typical is " The Flowers of My Grandmother ' s Death Have Freed Us All , " a work on paper by Tee A. Corinne that is a narrative miniature that abstracts universes . Judy van Wagner and Carol Davis are the curators. // The work declares itself more loudly , for the most part , in " Costumes , Masks and Disguises . " Joan Killion ' s delicate " kimono " pieces hang in one corner . Fran Hodes , Stephanie Rauschenbusch and Hedy O ' Beil are the curators . ( For information on these and five other caucus exhibitions , see the box on page C23 . Posters with details of other women ' s shows are on display at most of the spaces . Information : 772-9408 . ) These shows offer material for thought on past and present views of art by women . It has been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastel , that they are good at portraits , usually of children and women , as well as still lifes and occasional gardens in full bloom , that their work is seldom humorous , and that it deals most in personal history. // Yes , contemporary feminists have responded , art by women may have a strong intuitive streak , a concern with authenticity of emotion and everyday life experience , and a strong involvement of the artist with her subject matter . There is a good deal of sexual imagery and ritual in art by women . Women artists may consciously incorporate such " womanly " elements as needlework in their art today . And the work is often fragmented , though not necessarily small . <> <> Variety of Intimate Themes // " Art doesn ' t have to be huge to be of monumental importance , " says Nancy Fried , who was a speaker at the caucus ' s national conference earlier this month in New York City . Miss Fried ' s small , peopled clay rooms , fired in her kitchen stove , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate , domestic themes can be peculiarly threatening . Ann Chwatsky , another speaker at the conference , was surprised at the hostility that greeted an exhibition of her sensitive and unsentimental photographs of pregnant women . " How could you let a child see this ? " one visitor wrote in the gallery guest book. // There is a reason for the traditional view of art by women , Annie Shaver-Crandell , president of the caucus , says . " Women were kept out of art schools until the 19th century , " she said . " Their fragile little selves were not supposed to be subjected to the sight of nude male models . Women had to find , on their own , women artists who ' d take on a student , or they had to be born into a family of artists who would teach them . So women tended to specialize in still lifes and portraiture , things you could learn without having to go to art school. " // Biological differences may find expression in the work of male and female artists . And social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art history texts and in exhibitions - do affect form and content . A weekend survey of art by women might also include " The Guerrilla Girls Hits List , " an activist poster in the window of Printed Matter , at 7 Lispenard Street , that acknowledges those who do write about and exhibit art by women . " I think younger women artists haven ' t noticed that things have slipped back since the women ' s movement in the 1970 ' s , " Carol Grape , a sculptor and caucus member , says . " More galleries were showing women ' s art five years ago . They figure they ' ve done their bit . We have to do ours . " <> <> Images of Women and Rooms // Photographic work by Francesca Woodman , on exhibit through March 14 at the Hunter College Art Gallery on Lexington Avenue and the southwest corner of 68th Street , yields another statement of those conditions , both in the almost cheekily assured execution and the harrowing intensity of its images of women and rooms . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. ) One aim of the caucus is to publicize art created by women . Neglected , such art has lacked a larger , historical context . And therefore , it has sometimes been dismissed or , just as blindly , celebrated for a superior virtue . The work on view this weekend suggests a context and a past. // Providing one sense of framework is work by established older women artists on view in " American Women Printmakers , " which runs through tomorrow at Associated American Artists , 20 West 57th Street ( 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. today and tomorrow ) . // Landscapes that look beyond the garden are the subject of a number of exhibitions . " Patterns of Nature , " a group show organized by the Women in the Arts Foundation , is on view through March 12 at the Arsenal Gallery , Central Park at Fifth Avenue and 64th Street . ( Monday through Friday from 9 to 4 : 30 . ) At Jeffrey Hoffeld and Company , 1020 Madison Avenue at 79th Street , there are serenely macrocosmic views of Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Miranda Wilson , through tomorrow ( today from 9 : 30 to 5 : 30 and tomorrow from 10 to 5 : 30 ) . And Karen Gunderson looks upward in a show of her skyscapes at the Fischbach Gallery , 24 West 57th Street , through March 26 . ( Monday through Saturday , 10 to 5 : 30 . ) Nudes and ' Images of Power ' // For evidence of the wit that may be found in art by women , stops are in order at " The Male Nude : Women Regard Men , " at the Hudson Center , 105 Hudson Street , through tomorrow , and at the Ruth Siegel Gallery , 24 West 57th Street , where large , intensely colored and amusingly stylized works in several media by Mimi Gross are on view through March 8 . ( The Hudson Center is open Tuesday through Saturday , noon to 6 , the Siegel Gallery Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 6 . ) A largely post-movement survey of art in many media is on view in " The Heroic Female , Images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91 Franklin Street , through tomorrow , as a fund-raiser for the New York Feminist Art Institute . Of special interest here are Louise Bourgeois ' s " Femme Maison " and Suzanne Resnik ' s teasing " Crystal Changing Device with Operator ' s Manual . " ( Tuesday through Saturday noon to 6 . ) If one closed the weekend with a tour through " the new , " that tour might include a sculpture exhibition of allusive organic forms in wood by Ellen Driscoll , at the Paulo Salvador Gallery , 216 East 10th Street , through Sunday ( noon to 6 ) , or " Vital Space , " a wide-ranging group show at the Mokotoff , 735 East Ninth Street , that runs through March 16 . ( Wednesday through Sunday , 1 to 6 . ) And a last stop might be at the Kamikaze Klub , 531 West 19th Street ( 227-2108 or 807-0838 ) . On view there is work by such artists as Yvonne Jacquette , Joyce Kozlov , Miriam Schapiro and Nancy Spero . Most of the work sells for under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the feminist journal of politics and the arts. // Is there a women ' s art ? The issue may never be settled . But this is an excellent weekend to explore the evidence. //
