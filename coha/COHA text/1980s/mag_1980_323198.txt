Torn by dissension , the Labor Party looks for a new boss <P> His voice and face strained with emotion , former Prime Minister James Callaghan , 68 , summoned members of the Labor Party shadow cabinet to his office in the House of Commons one afternoon last week to announce what some of his colleagues had wanted and others had feared . After 35 years in politics , Callaghan was stepping down as head of the Labor Party in favor of a new leader " who will bring fresh vigor , fresh authority , unity and purpose . " <P> A champion of consensus and compromise , Callaghan leaves a party racked by an internecine war between its right and left wings . His own right wing was savaged by an advancing militant left at the party 's annual conference at Blackpool earlier this month . Resolutions were passed that would commit the party , if it returns to power , to taking Britain out of the European Community , and would undermine the Western alliance and NATO by unilateral nuclear disarmament and a ban on U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy changes , the left captured vital parts of the machinery that controls the party . The schism is now so deep that it raises the possibility of a breakup of the 74-year-old Labor Party , an event that would have profound effects on Britain 's political system . <P> Even as his lieutenants stood to applaud Callaghan 's announcement , they were thinking ahead to the race for succession . Callaghan still tops the polls as Britain 's most popular political figure , besting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 47% to 38% in a survey released last week . Within his own party , however , he is a spent force , little more than a pawn in the struggle for control . Dispirited since Labor 's defeat at the hands of the Tories in May 1979 , and exhausted by his party 's constant infighting , he had hoped to reverse the rising power of the party 's left extremists and turn Labor over , united , to a successor in his own mold . His presumed choice : former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey , 63 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must now fight for the post in two rounds . At the Blackpool conference , Labor 's militant left , managed to change the way the party selects its leader , the potential Prime Minister . That privilege has always been exercised by Labor 's members of the House of Commons-the Parliamentary Labor Party ( P.L.P. ) . The left pushed through a proposal for a new electoral college made up not only of M.P.s but also of representatives of local committees and delegates from trade unions . Whatever ratio of membership is adopted at a special Labor Party conference on Jan. 24 , the radical left will have grabbed a piece of the right 's power .
