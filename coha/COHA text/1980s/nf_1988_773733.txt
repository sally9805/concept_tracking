txt // conform to these , clothes had to be well-cut and in fashion . Elegance must be added to cleanliness ; they went hand-in-hand , and , in the end , the same adjective qualified them both . When Tallemant described the entourage of Marshal de Grammont as always propre and in good condition ' , the word had obviously also acquired connotations of order and decency.8 The evolution of treatises on etiquette is revealing in this respect . After Erasmus , works on manners for children , and especially manuals designed for courtiers , devoted more and more attention to clothes . Clean clothes gradually came to equate with clean linen , and decency came increasingly to require respect for fashion and custom . I wish the courtier to be always clean propre and elegant in his clothing , and to conform to honest and decent behaviour . ' 9 It was all of this which was soon to be encapsulated in one word . That the courtier was clean ' signified a whole range of attributes . Cleanliness ' being a certain correctness in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a person 's actions as regards other people , it is necessary , if we wish to be clean ' , to tailor our clothes to our figure , to our condition , to our age . . . The one law which is indispensable to this is fashion , it is under her absolute mastery that reason should be deployed.10 This cleanliness ' , completely equated with manners , that is , this propriety ' could be applied to both people and objects . When Colbert inaugurated his Chateau de Sceaux with a royal feast followed by fireworks , Le Mercure galant was soon bogged down in pompous formulas . The decorations and the furniture were of that marvellous " propriety " proprete which catches the eye as much as exceptional magnificence . ' The village girls , in their turn , gave of their best on the approaches to the castle . They donned their most beautiful clothes and danced . They , too , showed themselves to be proper ' . The paths were covered with leaves . The peasant girls danced on top of them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " propre . " For apartments and modest women alike , the description was the same . Both presented their very best appearance . The word was used in the same way during the visit to Saint-Cyr made by the bishop of Chartres in 1692 . And with the same // amalgamation ; everything was proper ' in Mme de Maintenon 's institution . Everything was in order . One could only admire both rich objects and symmetry in design . The worthy bishop wanted to see everything . For three days he progressed round offices , gardens and dormitories . He opened the linen-cupboard and lingered in the church ; the linen there was of the very finest , the wood mouldings were most imposing , and all covered by the same term ? an inimitable propriety ' . The cells were visited one by one , they were all , of course , very proper ' ; the furniture consisted only of water jug and cup . It was not noticed , however , that these utensils were lacking in the dormitory of the pupils . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question did not arise . What mattered was style ; the desirable qualities were regularity and elegance . Correctness even took precedence over simple cleanliness . Each example shows this in its own way . On both sides of the first gallery there were two oratories constructed of wood with windows overlooking the church , in one of which , very properly tres proprement adorned , there was an iron grill , very proper tres propre , about two and a half feet wide and three in height . ' 12 In the case of clothing , fashion and this new cleanliness ' ended by merging . The latter meant first and foremost respect for the canon Such a coincidence of meaning between style and cleanliness could only happen because appearance played a central role . There had to be a systematic priority accorded to the external for the definition to begin to change . Cleanliness had to apply essentially to clothes for the word to focus on clothes to the extent of changing its meaning . The success of the new definition only confirms the seventeenth-century view of cleanliness ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More generally , it was integrated into a specific social model ? the court as example and spectacle . It was not only a matter of visible vestimentary signs . It was a matter of cultivating , almost consciously , a practice of illusion . The art of the court was essentially an art of performance . The fete at Sceaux and the opera at Versailles belonged to the same world . Their value lay in their display , their tactics were those of the theatre ; as in Baroque art , where to display was at the same time a way of concealing . It was the theatrical gesture , the show , that mattered . It might even , at a pinch , be said that the peasant women of Sceaux were // more proper ' for having transformed their streets into theatre . Their order , more or less contrived , had been able to sustain the illusion . Effort went into deception.13 The best example of this is linen , which served as a sign of the internal . It stood for , and represented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in dress came to correlate to the others . Only what was visible counted . But this , at least for those who dictated the norms , formed a whole . The details were never unimportant . The effect was that of a picture , considered and studied , where no piece could be seen in isolation . Given this inter-dependence , many elements were interchangeable . From the positioning of the hat to the cleanliness of the clothes , did it not , in some sense , amount to the same thing ? Let everything be done properly dans laproprete . Do not wear the hat too high on the head , or tipped too low over the eyes , like a braggart or a show-off . . . Do not wear your clothes dirty or unstitched , or dusty or showing wear , and clean and brush them as a general rule once a day . ' 14 Thus advise descriptions where the wor0rop to describe clothes meant style as much as simple cleanliness . 1f described the shape as much as the material . It confirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilation of cleanliness and the visible , and a demonstration by this means of distinction . The art of display eventually went beyond dress ; the picture grew more complex . The face , in particular , was redrawn . Make-up had , since the sixteenth century , redefined its features . The very pale whites of Clouet , and the even whiter whites of Bronzino , gave flesh the appearance of alabaster . " The red of the lips stands out from a smooth , milky surface ; the outlines have a wax-like clarity . A few decades later , the picture was enriched by rouge accentuating the contrasts . The noble children painted by Largilliere in the seven-teenth century have cheeks like cherries embellishing their starch-white faces . And make-up was no longer confined to women . In Largilliere 's Louis XIV et sa famille ' , painted effigies pose side by side , eyebrows emphasised , cheeks rouged , their theatrical pose only echoing their contrived features . " Appearances 83 Illusion was accentuated by a new and decisive practice : powdering the hair . Appearance was recomposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objects . Hair was no longer combed but powdered . This practice was not completely new . Powder had long been used for its drying properties . It made it possible to dispense with washing the hair whilst retaining its softness . It was substituted for water , the latter feared as a means of cleaning . When it is a question of cleansing the hair of the head , washing should only be employed with the greatest caution . . . Instead , rub with bran stewed in a pan , changing it frequently ; or spread over and between the hair some drying and cleansing powder before going to bed , and remove it in the morning with a comb.17 Powder had , in fact , already enjoyed a lasting success at the court of Henri III . Sweet-smelling , it was no longer only a means of washing the hair , but had become a hair cosmetic . If , some decades later , the use of powder was more or less universal amongst the aristocracy , it was because it added another way of enhancing appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a further extension of artifice in appearance . The intention was to mask nature , as if to erect a screen between the body and the onlooker . It was part of a determined policy of artificiality which gradually nibbled away at the visible . Along with the cut of clothes , powdered hair became an element in propriety ' . It com-pleted the picture ; it , too , was immediately included in the evaluation of physical cleanliness . It was adopted by those whose way of life was by no means confined to the court . Beaufort , for example , opponent of royal power and turbulent and unruly captain , shows that this practice gradually became normal amongst the aristocracy in the middle of the seventeenth century . His appearance was often deplorable ? his collars neglected , his hair unkempt . But Beaufort was not ignorant of the code . He had only to adopt it for everyone to exclaim at this rediscovered propriety ' . He was turned out quite differently from normal . He is the dirtiest man in the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather collar , a blue scarf , a white handkerchief at his neck : his " proprete " astonished the company , and he made excuses . ' 18 The practice was increasingly widely adopted . One of Scarron 's matrons could not receive a woman friend until she // had done her hair , curled and powdered it ' .19 Scarron mocks the old woman 's clumsy and tremulous gestures . But propriety ruled in matters of form and colour . The norm prevailed . When Furetiere ridiculed the bourgeois for their black and filthy ' 20 hair , he was obviously implicitly contrasting it to powdering , which , for him , was no longer simply a refinement . The contrast was also with the wig , the ultimate in artificiality . Powdering played the same role as lace and linen . Its absence signified impropriety and at the same time a public renunciation . It was during her bitter periods that Mlle de Montpensier , Louis XIV 's cousin , paraded certain austerities : no longer powdering , wearing different clothes , and abstaining from certain practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her social retreats . After each deception and each sorrow she abandoned for a while certain vestimentary signs as so many signs of propriety ' . The absence of powder inevitably featured in all these negative gestures . I no longer went to court , I no longer put on my beauty-spots or powdered my hair ; I neglected my hair until it got so dirty and long that I was quite unrecognisable . ' 21 THE PERFUME THAT CLEANSED ' Powder , in fact , had another purpose ? its perfume . It did not yet , in the seventeenth century , have that silvery appearance presented by the white film plastered onto wigs a century later . Its whiteness could be detected , but remained faint and indistinct . It was as much a question of smell as of appearance . Une dame ne peut jamais etre prisee Si elle n'a son chef de poudre parfume.22 The dried and pounded substances used in its manufacture23 produced a scent as well as a rather muted colour . The illusion was complex , its signs more subtle and more elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . This was remarked on by various Appearances 85 pamphlets stimulated by the new fashions of the early-seventeenth century . They taint everything with their false wigs , sprinkled with powder of Cyprus to combat even worse smells . ' 24 Perfume was an ideal tool in this art of appearance , all the more deceptive in that it was invisible . It was employed in chests , which were saturated with powder so that the linen retained its smell . This practice even made it possible , under certain conditions , to dispense with daily changes of linen . You make containers for linen in the form of little chests just big enough to hold the fine linen that a man of quality might need in two days ; you garnish them both within and without with the same fragrant materials and substances as wig-boxes. ' 25 Cinnamon water was held in the mouth ' to give the breath a sweet smell ' .26 And scent-boxes gradually released their aromatic vapours ; as for example at the magnificent reception ' 27 given to Don Carlos in Le Roman comique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador of Suleiman Aga.28 The perfume was sometimes so heady that opening a chest could turn into an ordeal . Onlookers choked when her servants unpacked the queen 's chests at Saint-Germain in 1649 . They fled or held their breath , not daring to breath until the chests had been aired . This was the logic of a perfume so overwhelming that it became unbreathable.29 Perfume was not , of course , a discovery of the seventeenth century . It is often mentioned in medieval inventories . Queen Clemence of Hungary , the wife of Jean le Hutin. , owned several amber apples , one of them ornamented with gold and precious stones ' , 30 at her death in 1328 . The inventory of the Chateau des Beaux , a century later , records a little silver box holding musk ' .31 Royal accounts had for a long time recorded purchases of rose-water and honeysuckle water , even vine-branches , roses and lavender . . . to put with linen ' .32 And at Broceliande , finally , mythical site of the thirteenth-century romance of Chretien de Troyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular , highly-regarded skill , // knowing how to distil rose-water , 33 proof both of the importance the practice had already acquired , and of its relative rarity . The real change came , once again , with the ostentatious use of linen , its burgeoning out over the clothes , and the heavy emphasis on its lightness . Lace , in particular , should be perfumed , as with the scented shirts of the characters of Margaret of Navarre , 34 or the scents impregnating the collars and cuffs ' of the gallants of Dupont de Drusac , 35 or the imperial oil serving to wash the linen of some great prince ' described in successive editions of the Secrets of Alexis Piemontais in the sixteenth century.36 The seventeenth century at first simply inherited these practices , along with the use of linen and manners . Certain sensibilities were no longer explained , so firmly were they embedded in the culture of the privileged , too obvious to need justifying . The protracted debate about strong smells , in which garlic , amongst other things , figured as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing of the past . Bouchet , though not without a trace of irony , remained close to popular culture when , in the sixteenth century , he praised those smells already rejected by people who knew how to behave . Garlic is the true meat of the soldier , giving him heart for the fight , as good as onions . . . And , as our ancestors used garlic , they were not ashamed to smell of it . ' 37 In the seventeenth century the rupture was complete . A gulf developed between refined and other smells ; the debate was over . Garlic eaten with vinegar every morning ' 38 was a stimulant of the people . A little good myrrh in the mouth ' 39 for the same purpose was quite a different matter . The two solutions were no longer comparable . The distinction was one of sensibility and of cost . The treatises of perfumers and apothecaries fostered certain distinctions , depending on their public . Lemery , in 1709 , proposed the ultimate classification , distinguishing a royal perfume ' , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor ' . But this last was not aesthetic ; composed of common oil ' mixed with soot , it served only to disinfect the air ' .40 // The seventeenth century also inherited the therapeutic conno-tations of perfume ; it was good for you . Its use served to strengthen the body and marvellously refreshed the brain ' .41 It counteracted corrupt and dangerous air . The development of measures against the plague provides the best example . Chauliac recommended fire as well as flight during the Great Plague of 1348 in Avignon . Fire purified ; it improves the air ' .42 But the burning of fragrant substances gradually came to be considered even more effective . Purification and perfumed emanations combined . Similarly , smells with a sweet and fragrant ' 43 perfume were gradually preferred to the penetrating and long-lasting smells meant to preserve the mouth in times of plague . Gum benzoin , storax , myrrh , musk , and rosewood , made into pastilles held in the mouth , came gradually to be preferred to sharper tastes . Vinegar was another matter . Its sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people walking in the streets sniffed impregnated pads . The acid contained active principles . Perfume , however , gave better protection from the contagion by correcting the corruption of the air . Its role went far beyond the merely social . Attractive smells were , by their very composition , opposed to decay . They added a protective dimension to the simple pleasure of the senses . They had a psychological effect , by ' marvell-ously assuaging the sensual and cephalic faculty ' .44 The role of perfume in the art of disguise and appearance was thus a complex one . It was not confined to concealment or pleasure . It was also , in a very concrete sense , purification . Appearance even assumed the force of reality . When the men of Rabelais ' Theleme drenched themselves with perfume before meeting their lady-friends , they believed they were actually changing their bodies . There was no use of water , simply impregnation with perfumes ; washing was subsumed in a strategy of perfume . At the doors to the rooms of the women 's // lodge were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they visited the ladies . ' 45 In other words , perfume effaced as much as it concealed . Classical France not only inherited these images , but elaborated them . The array of objects thought to be fortifying because they were perfumed continued to grow . There were , for example , medicinal caps , whose linings , saturated with powder , exercised a stimulating effect by manifestly restoring the animal spirits by virtue of their smell ' .46 Sachets of scent were carried between linen and doublets . Even utensils in everyday use were adapted and altered . The linen which held toilet articles such as combs , mirrors and powders might be put between perfumed linings . You sprinkle over coarse powder of violets , then you cover the whole with tabby . Before putting on the tabby , you should rub it gently with a little civet. ' 47 The royal inventories from the end of the seventeenth century record over forty items of this type , including a dozen specially perfumed by Martial.48 The perfume in this case was playing two roles . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of smell . But at the same time it purified . It was the complete opposite of dirt and counteracted it . All the values of appearance were subsumed in the operational . Perfume cleansed , repulsed and erased . Illusion had been turned on its head to become reality . Wearing perfume when in the streets was therefore not simply an aesthetic gesture , and walking with an amber apple in the hand was more than a matter of fashion . And the scene , common for several decades , as described by an Italian visitor to Paris at the time of Henri IV , became , in a sense , symbolic . A stream of fetid water coursed through every street of the town , into which ran the dirty water from each house , and which tainted the air ; consequently it was essential to carry sweet-scented flowers in the hand to allay the smell . ' 49 Equally significant is the distinction between certain Parisian hospitals drawn by Locatelli , a Bolognese traveller of insatiable curiosity , who , in 1664 , traversed the France of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel-Dieu , for example , where the sick lay four or Appearances 89 even five to a bed , and the constant danger of plague at the Quinze-Vingts , which was swamped with incurables , with the apparent calm at la Charite , where a distinctive smell assailed the visitor . The perfume of scent-boxes wafted through the rooms day and night . This aroma , noticeable in every room , fascinated the Italian priest . Surely this agreeable smell protected the body ? For Locatelli , it was what made all the difference between the hospitals . It drove away contagion , giving a special strength to the most worn-out organs . Near each bed there was a little altar decorated with flowers , with a brazier , onto which , from time to time , the attendant threw fine perfumes . ' S0 Locatelli 's fascination was so great that he momentarily longed to share the life of these unhappy people , even though they were as crammed in here as elsewhere . The recourse to anti-smells ' completed the range of classical cleanliness . It even added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was first and foremost a matter of spectacle ' , extending the image of linen and of the visible parts of the skin . The sachets placed in the armpits or between the legs , or slipped into the folds of gowns or behind doublets were , indeed , sachets of cleanliness . They served as supplementary instruments in the vital game of appearances . Of central importance in the cleanliness of the classical period , however , was the limited employment of water . The actions of the princess Palatine at the end of a taxing journey are highly revealing . One day in August 1705 , the princess had travelled far on roads baked dry by the sun . She arrived at Marly exhausted , her make-up ruined , her body bathed in sweat . Her face was so stained by dirt from the road that she agreed to wash it . I had to wash my face , it was so dusty ; I looked as if I was wearing a grey mask . ' S1 This was an exceptional occurrence . Otherwise , the princess changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was clean ' again . But it was the linen t ' . . which had been washed . Water flowed in profusion in the gardens of Chateau de Marly , but liquid hardly touched the skin of those who lived there. - Cleanliness existed , but it was the cleanliness of what was visible . Part 3 From water that penetrated to water that strengthened 7 . A pleasant sensation on the skin When he describes the bath taken in 1746 by the Marquise du Chatelet , Longchamp , then her valet , ' may surprise the modern reader ; their relationship did not permit of modesty . The valet was responsible for the temperature of the water and supervised the boiler . From time to time he poured the contents into the tub , taking care not to burn the marquise . In short he was there in the room , in attendance , attentive . The lady felt no embarrassment as she undressed and bathed , felt no inclination , even , to render the water opaque . The conditions of mistress and valet were too far apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a person . As neutral ' as an inanimate object and as familiar ' as the household furniture , he was completely assimilated into the background . He handled the familiar utensils , but was a creature apart . What Longchamp might see was irrelevant ; he did not belong to the same universe as the young woman . She did not see him . He hovered somewhere between childhood and domestic service , too far away , at all events , to affect the bathing lady . Longchamp was conscious as he described the scene that he was recording customs that would change with the end of the Ancien Regime . He emphasised the detachment of the marquise , her cold familiarity , her extreme but , quite unconscious remoteness . The valet was entirely defined by his function , that of intimate yet trivial services . Another similar man ( or woman ) could just as well perform these insignificant acts . Longchamp admitted his unease . The body of the marquise troubled him so much that his hand trembled as he poured the water . This conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs were changing . Only female servants attended great ladies in their baths from the end of the century.2 93 94 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . On the other hand , Longchamp makes no comment on the bath itself . He found it quite normal , which implies another change . A bath no longer occasioned surprise , but had become part of daily life . The episode is therefore doubly revealing ; it shows a transformation of private decencies , and a transformation of attitudes to water , at least amongst the privileged . The ba had reappeared ' in this social milieu since the second third of the eighteenth century . This is not to say that it had become common , or that cleanliness was its expressed purpose , but at least a transformation in this field had become a possibility . With it , washing gradually spread , and immersion , till then extremely rare , began to be acceptable . Water was integrated into new circuits ; this tentative practice could expand . It was probably still very restricted , perhaps even rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to a very narrow elite , and it did not correspond to any heightened concern with matters of hygiene . But in promoting what was almost a new practice , it had its consequences ; for certain people in the middle of the eighteenth century changing linen could no longer be all that was needed to care for the skin . A new treatment , using water , existed . Very slowly , within the closets of the great nobility , new criteria were elaborated . A particular sort of bathing , in specific surroundings , and with specific attentions , emerged . It was also specific in that it remained infrequent , and in the ideas about the body which it supposed ; we need to define this special character . It suggests , once again , that there will always be many different ways of using water . But we need to look at this aristocratic and still uncommon bathing in order to understand how , by successive stages , and not without changes of direction , the use of water came to be transformed . A NOVEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . A series of building works was undertaken at Versailles ; for example , to construct special rooms to accommodate baths , to install them in several of the main apartments , or to change their position during the frequent phases of rebuilding.3 Luynes thought it worth mentioning the queen 's request to use the king 's baths temporarily when building works rendered her own inaccessible . // The queen bathed the day before yesterday . The baths in her apartment had been changed at the time of her journey to Fontainebleau . . . The baths previously in her large green closet being temporarily out of use , she had someone request , or herself requested , the king for permission to bathe in his bath . The king granted his permission with the best possible grace.4 The scene might even be made into a spectacle . In 1742 , when the royal mistress took a bath , she spun the episode out into a series of stages which were followed by the courtiers . Mme de Chateauroux obliged the king to be present at her baths , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the salon , leaving them in the chamber with the door half-open , and continuing to talk to them . When Mme de Chateauroux got out of the bath , she retired to her bed , dined there , and everyone then entered her chamber.5 This pretentious behaviour was primarily a demonstration of the newly acquired power of the favourite , but it also confirms the change in the status of bathing towards the middle of the eighteenth century . Allusions begin to appear in letters , memoirs and in many learned texts . References are at first rare , but become frequent from 1740 on , with , for the first time , mention of the royal example . When it pleased the king to bathe ... ' 6 The prejudices of Louis XIV were forgotten and outmoded , though certain precautions persisted ; his successor , for example , chose water drawn from the middle of the Seine in preference to water carried in pipes ' . ' Water taken from the beds of great rivers was believed to conserve greater purity . Water , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it diffused . It was still assumed to penetrate the body , and affect its organs and functions . It disturbed , and produced numerous mecha-nical effects . It insinuates itself into every interstice , which it enlarges by the slackening produced by its warmth . ' $ A body immersed was a body impregnated . The flux exercised an irresistible pressure . The force with which water enters the pores is immense . Its limits are unknown . ' 9 But , above all , as in the past , it left behind open and fragile pores . It logically followed , therefore , that there was always a risk of a bath doing harm . It was still essential to take precautions : a 96 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . purge before immersion so that the infiltration did not increase surfeits ; rest and bed afterwards to give maximum protection to the body and ward off fatigue . But fears of plague , of various diseases and of obscure weaknesses were a thing of the past , lost and forgotten . This was not only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings itself no longer seemed to have sufficient power to occasion acute anxiety ; it seemed that the body could react in other ways than by a passive openness . Immersion became a possible and acceptable practice , for some even familiar , as shown by the Marquise du Chatelet . Very slowly , bathing established itself amongst the upper classes of eighteenth century society . This new practice did not , however , overthrow tradition at one go . It is clear that in the middle of the century bathing remained very rare , even amongst the aristocracy . In J.-F . Blondel 's ) ' Architecture francaise of 1750 , which recorded the plans of seventy-three private Parisian mansions , only five had a bathroom.10 Out of twenty or so luxurious mansions described by Marot at the same period , two had bathrooms.11 In the middle of the century , then , fewer than one in ten great mansions had a special space for a bath . Bathtubs were probably more common . In 1751 the Encyclopedie included a definition and a description of this item of furniture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less standard shape : four and a half feet long by two and a half wide , and twenty-six inches high . It might be made of copper or of wood bound with iron . It was , therefore , no longer round , and already close in shape to that of today.12 Also , such bathrooms as existed were by no means used con-sistently . At Commercy , for example , during Louis XV 's visits in 1755 , the bathroom became the apartment of the Marquise de Boufllers.13 The tub was covered over and concealed . The room lost its special function , and was turned into living quarters . The marquise held entertainments and dinners there . Other examples confirm that the practice was still by no means general . The Duc de Croy indirectly shows this when he describes the marriage of his daughter to the Duc d'Havre in 1762 . The bath taken by his daughter is reminiscent of those of the seventeenth century , reserved for life 's A pleasant sensation on the skin 97 great occasions , in particular the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their explicit reference to this bath , the Duc 's memoirs emphasise its rarity . Why insist on it if the young lady regularly bathed ? The 17 ? 18 ? 19 were spent in making visits , for my daughter in being purged and bathed and preparing her body and her soul . ' 14 Similarly , when , in 1769 , Condorcet remarked that he occasionally bathed , Julie de Lespinasse did not immediately as-sociate this act with cleanliness . Is it for the sake of your health , or is it by choice that you take baths , and were you born under the sign of the fishes ? ' 15 Even more significant are some scenes of arrivals and halts whilst on journeys . A few years later , Gauthier de Brecy , leaving Paris for his Provencal Intendancy , spent the first night at the house of a relative in Dijon . He refers to cleanliness as a necessity , but not to bathing . I arrived at his house in travelling clothes . I needed to clean myself up : he gave me a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussian fireplace . I shaved , I really needed it . ' 16 Resuming his secretaryship with a Roman cardinal in 1754 , Casanova got a reception which both surprised and delighted him ? water and a tub , but not a bath . I was shown into an apartment consisting of three rooms , including a bedroom hung with damask . . . A servant came to give me a light dressing-gown , went out and returned a moment later with a second carrying linen and a large tub of water . It was put down in front of me , they took off my shoes and washed my feet . ' 17 Cleanliness was clearly involved here , but not actually a bath . This tentativeness , a taste still uncertain but nevertheless real , is explicable in terms of the novelty of the practice , the hesitancy of any new beginning . A new practice is inevitably fragile , inconsistent and slow to become established . It does not achieve immediate geo-graphical and social victory ; it needs time . The bathroom and the bathtub were the preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becoming more common . SENSIBILITY But this gradualness and hesitancy had other causes . The situation was complicated by a continued preoccupation with the mechanical 98 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . effects of water . The new interest in bathing even reinforced this . The body , agitated and shaken by a water which was alien to it , was inevitably profoundly affected . Immersion corresponded to a series of actions whose effects on the body extended far beyond cleanliness , and some of which were considerably more important . These effects continued to dominate the imagination in the middle of the century . Hot water , the most penetrating , extended its emollient influence to every part of the body ; warm water tempered over-heating , calmed nerves and malaise during hot weather ; cold water , by causing contractions , could firm up the muscles and invigorate . It was precisely when water seemed better accepted that the multiplicity of its actions was quoted in its favour . The new interest in bathing and the insistence on the variety of its effects for long went hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , seemed to be crucial . Oppositions were established : the regular as opposed to the seasonal bath , for example , and , most important of all , the cold as opposed to the hot , but also the strengthening as opposed to the softening . The choice was all the more important because water was a subtle medium , and it was by exploiting this subtlety that warmth could vary its effects . But water was still a medium of waves and shocks , of movement and pressure . It created a condition for the submerged body . It affected it more than climate ; as it enveloped , it controlled . It was not a neutral substance . How could bathing be imagined without reference to these effects ? These physical activities were all the more important in that they soon acquired social significance . The people who , from the middle of the eighteenth century , basked in warm water , were not the same as those who , a decade or two later , discovered the virtues of cold . A refined and sensual practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; luxury contrasted with the severity the cold methods contrived . A significant divergence emerged between a very aristo-cratic softness and an asceticism of successful ambition ; ostenta-tious luxury against ambitious vigour . 18 Water had to be seen as an active substance for such applications to be suggested , to conjure up turbulent , dynamic images . These , by fusing with hygienic criteria , further complicated the picture . The first eighteenth-century baths , taken in private mansions , were hot , and apparently for the purpose of cleanliness . But the attention // devoted to the mechanics of water already hinted at a greater complexity . Richelet 's distinction in 1728 suggested certain nuances : Young people bathe for pleasure , and others take baths for the sake of their health . ' 19 Pleasure , then , came first . As far as health is concerned , he probably did not have in mind care of the skin ; the dynamic effects of water on the system were probably more important . In any case , the bathroom was a luxury , one which was rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be understood as such . It implied a specific practice . In mid-century at least , cleanliness was probably not the dominant motive . There can be no doubt that a bathroom added distinction to noble houses . The story published by Bastide in 1753 , La Petite Maison ' 21 provides an illustration of this which is all the more interesting in that it is so blatant . To seduce Melite , a reluctant lady-friend , the Marquis de Fremicour suggests that she visits the house he has recently built on the banks of the Seine , at the gates of Paris . The young woman hesitates , teases , but finally accepts . The inevitable happens . The visitor is conquered bit by bit as she proceeds through the rooms . The growth of her sentiment is closely in step with her discovery of the new house . It is not , however , its magnificence which wins her over , but rather its convenience and elegance , taste , rather than grandeur , cleverness and utility rather than ostentation . It was a question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors rather neglected . 121 It was a question of a harmonious arrangement of rooms , many and concealed services , a studied profusion of paintings , engravings , stucco and perfumes ; a prestige of techniques , then , and a refinement of physical surroundings . Progress lay in comfort and aesthetics . The seduction of Melite had its origin in this double impact . It was not by chance that the visit ended in the bathroom . She walked on and entered a new room more delightful than any she had yet seen ... This new room was a bathroom . Marble , porcelain , muslin , no expense had been spared ... At one side was a small washroom , with panelling painted by Houet ... I ca n't bear it , she said , it is too beautiful . There is nothing like it on earth . 122 Cleanliness , aesthetics and refinement united in one single emotion . 100 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . The publication of Bastide 's story in the economic journal in 1753 is significant . In line with the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together the themes of technical advancement and sensibility , of luxury and progress . It repeated the arguments of Voltaire and Montesquieu : the refinement of the arts was the precondition for the refinement of the senses . And economic matters governed both themes . For the arts , far from weakening the people ' , 23 caused sensibility to blossom and produced wealth . Bastide extended this new consciousness of the early eighteenth century : the arts , as they affected the senses , also multiplied resources . They had a dynamic effect on industries . The superfluity ' extended beyond the purely economic . Wealth determined the power of nations . By his pleasures , Voltaire 's Mondain in fact enriches a great state ' .24 It is his desires and tastes which stimulate craftsmen and manufactures , before being adopted by them . Old moral rigidities could , more than ever before , be cast aside . Pleasure , and sometimes even softness ' 25 found other formulations . A new and insistent relationship to the economy gave them their justification . With this new relationship , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an additional refinement for the worldly . It was a further subtlety of the senses and of taste : Il court au bain : les parfums les plus doux Rendent sa peau plus fraiche et plus polie Le plaisir presse : Il vole an rendez-vous.26 When Casanova described the apartment in Venice which had been lent him in 1754 by the French ambassador to further his amorous encounters , he saw in the marble bathroom adjoining the boudoir prepared for the mother of loves ' 27 a rare luxury . But it was a luxury of a very special sort , mingled with an eroticism and a sensuality which pushed into the background any idea of a functional purpose . The bath was a necessary , almost a superfluous , extra . It was in no way a basic or routine practice in the middle of the eighteenth century . It was the affirmation of a wealth in which sensuality was dominant . There was a similar ambiguity when Le Sage 's devil // allowed the scholar to enter in succession every house in Madrid ? a social and cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one bathroom scene in all these visits , but a very significant one : The second part of the building was inhabited by a beautiful woman who had just that minute bathed in milk and got into bed . This voluptuous woman was a widow . . . ' 28 It was , no doubt , the desire for a delicate , white skin which motivated this unusual practice . But it was the voluptuous refinement which attracted the attention of the observer . And when , for the first time , in 1759 , a text on the art of beauty was introduced by a long eulogy of bathing , the example was borrowed from contemporary images of the oriental harem ? lascivious connotations and female space . In the bath of the odalisque , pleasure always predominated over utility , and titillation of the senses over cleansing . The decor of the seraglio , as described by the author , indicated sensual delights : mother of pearl and pearls , aromatic plants , the bathtub itself transformed into a shell , creating more than just an ambience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act had other connotations than washing . Caught up in a image of refinement and preciosity , bathing could not be simply a functional practice . The acme of refined culture , it acted on the senses . Once bathed , the odalisque could surrender into the arms of a soft and voluptuous sleep ' .29 She was at the same time siren and languor . Mme de Genlis will tell us later the extent to which this practice induced a state of body ' . The potency of water quickly overwhelmed the senses , a mixture of relaxation and idleness , and worship of artifice . Bathing , in the middle of the eighteenth century , prospered by the indolence of the rich . Baths were a necessity in warm countries , a fashion in others ; they have never been so common and so widespread amongst us as recently . Laziness and idleness have done much to establish and maintain them . The afternoons are so long for those without work since they dine at six o'clock . ' 30 More than ever , the hot baths taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection with femininity and languor , the 102 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . practice gained ground as an additional pleasure authorised by wealth . And it was this very wealth that the first architects of bathrooms in the eighteenth century originally exploited . They did not necessarily design with constant or even regular use in mind . The new spaces were often places for refreshment and relaxation . They were chosen for moisture and shade . Plants and lawns were rarely far away . When the chosen site was an orangery with its northern wing exposed , it was because the bath was put there for hot days , not for cold spells . The attention to greenery , to sheltered gardens , and to hidden nooks , bespeaks , as if self-evident , a preferred time of year . The purpose of this apartment demands freshness , which is why it is usually placed on the ground floor of a building , shaded by a wood and near to a fountain ; so that , on leaving such places , you can breathe cool air in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly designed for the warmth of summer.32 There was the same emphasis , if more furtive and less direct , when Diderot wrote to the Volland sisters on 10 August 1769 . Oh , how hot it is , I seem to see all three of you in your bathing wraps. ' 33 The practice is also directly associated with warmth in the writings of Diderot . Bathing seems not yet to have been sufficiently frequent or familiar to be independent of times and seasons . Immersion was consistently linked with warmth , with the ambient atmosphere . Such immersion was intended prim-arily to create a condition ' . The same emphasis appears again when the Prince de Ligne recalled the baths he took after reading on the island in his sunny park . It was a luxurious place , associated with fresh , sweetly scented air ' .34 Le Medecin des dames summed it up in 1772 ? a seasonal practice , largely confined to an elite , vaguely sensual : Baths for reasons of health , or for voluptuousness , or cleanliness , are hardly ever taken in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " It was a complex practice , then , in which cleanliness combined with other motives . The nature of water meant that the impregnation of // the body and the effects on its condition dominated . To bathe was perhaps primarily to experience an atmosphere , undergo influences , feel an affect . Substances were interchanged , and pressures deployed . The bath roused the impressionable ' system . It was the quasi-internal sensibility of the body which was involved . It was a luxurious practice , at all events , confined to a tiny minority in the mid-eighteenth century , but a practice sufficiently important to give birth , almost at the same time , to new initiatives . A first establishment breaking with the tradition of the bath-house was built on the Seine in 1761 : hot baths with water pumped from the river to supply little cabins distributed about a boat . This novel arrangement was designed to facilitate the circulation of the water . The project was both therapeutic and hygienic at the same time . I see all the time the sick comforted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come here to safeguard their health . ' 36 Commended by the Faculty of Medicine , praised in various quarters , and benefiting from an exclusive privilege ' , 37 the Poitevin baths remained the only ones of their kind until 1783.38 Luxurious ( a bath cost three livres in 1761 , when the daily wage of a craftsman was then half a livre , and that of a day-labourer about a quarter ) , 39 they were intended for a restricted public , confirming the minority status of a hot bath . But , above all , the establishment wavered between being a therapeutic and a hygienic institution . Poitevin repeatedly asserted that it was necessary to give the rich the chance to be healed more quickly than if they had to seek the necessary help far from home ' .40 He also stressed , even delighted in , the showers designed to enhance the mechanical effects . The cures operate by displacing by a greater force the strange humours which form stoppages in the painful membranes and in the muscles swollen by their presence . ' 41 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its arrangements , if not in its practices , the 104 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . establishment was the forerunner of the baths of the nineteenth century . Finally , the new interest in bathing was expressed in the mid-eighteenth century by a marked increase in medical monographs on the subject . The question posed by the Dijon Academy in 1755 ( the virtues of the simple water bath ' ) 42 attests to the importance of the theme . The practice , therefore , had its theoretical aspect . And the first texts emphasised unequivocally the effects of the disturbance created even inside the organs . Attention was primarily concentrated on phenomena of sensibility . The body was soothed as much as taken over by the bath . Hot water causes a pleasant sensation on the skin which it bathes : the sensitive faculty delightfully relaxes the fleshy system . ' 43 The first intention was to describe this ; it was a matter of restoring a condition . The hot bath was basically enjoyable because it affected the senses by its very substance . This gentle relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing thence into the whole nervous system , renders the bath calming . It makes people somnolent. ' 44 Looked at more closely , it was once again the logic of fluxes and shocks which was dominant . When Guillard , in 1749 , tried to justify , in one sentence , baths for his happy citizen ' , it was the internal phenomena which consistently prevailed . Once the states had been described , interest was concentrated on the profound mechanism set in motion by the bath . The text is revealing because it marks the revival of the bath , and probably also already the beginnings of a new cleanliness , whilst remaining largely con-centrated on the constitution of the body . He bathes and rubs himself with oil to preserve the suppleness of his nerves , to facilitate sweating , to prevent the humours from settling too abundantly in any part of his body and causing sharp pains , often fatal , which could easily have been avoided . ' 45 The hot bath soothed because it made the humours circulate , and that was its chief virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water testify to a more profound transformation of hygiene amongst the elite in the second // third of the eighteenth century . A new item appeared , especially after 1740 , visible both in noble inventories and the accounts of the great cabinet-makers ; it was called a chair of cleanliness ' , or , already , a bidet ' . It was first being used a little before the 1730s . One day in 1726 , d'Argenson was received by Mme de Prie as she made her toilet . Polite words were exchanged . The scene was quite normal . Then , Mme de Prie , without more ado , sat on her bidet ' 46 and engaged in an intimate wash . D'Argenson wished to withdraw . Mme de Prie insisted he stay . The scene turned into a flirtation . The deed astonishes by its gracelessness ; but it is the date which concerns us here . There is no trace of such an object in the Malmaison inventory of 1713 , though one had appeared by 1750.4 ' In 1739 , Remy Peverie , cabinet-maker and turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belle Teste ' , could conceive bizarre double bidets , set back to back.48 For a long time the bidet indicated social distinction . Usually consisting of a wooden frame with a bowl of tin or earthenware , they were often of elaborate and luxurious appearance . The back-rest and the folding lid which concealed the bowl made a sort of chair often to be found in the chambers of the nobility . The one given to Mme de Pompadour by Duvaux in August 1751 was typical in its elaborate workmanship . A bidet with a back of rosewood veneer and floral mouldings , its feet and fittings of gilded bronze ' .49 Mme de Talmont 's bidet at Saint-Germain-en-Laye was equally typical : mounted in cherrywood with kingwood mouldings , above a footstool covered with red morocco studded with gilded nails ' .50 Some of these elaborate objects had crystal flasks incorporated into the seat-back . When , in 1762 , he made a metal bidet with feet which unscrewed to make it portable , J.-B . Dulin provided an indirect demonstration of the importance the object was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commode and a bidet are recorded in the closet of M. de Herault , and in that of the owner , in the inventory of the Chateau de Montgeofroy in 1775.52 Similarly , a commode and 106 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . a bidet were found in the closets of both the Prince de Conde and his wife in the inventory of the Palais-Bourbon in 1779 . Ss The engravings of G. de Saint-Aubin are revealing about this particular luxury . Les Papilloneries humaines ' of 1770 manages to illustrate a wealth of social situations by endowing butterflies with slender and anthropomorphic forms , a play on the image and a witness to customs . The toilet scene is that of the great noble houses ? elegant furniture , rich materials , attentive and busy servants . An insect ' has her hair done , adopting a nonchalant pose . The whole range of goods in use in mid-century ornaments the scene : engraved mirror , embroidered handkerchiefs , lace table covers , delicately shaped holders protecting flasks , and , finally , a bidet , placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidet remains , however , a very rare object in the middle of the century , hardly ever found in the bourgeois world . There was , for example , no bidet in the house of J.-L . Tamisier , a merchant who died at Apt in 1767 in possession of more than 100,000 livres of rent.55 He knew , nevertheless , how to enjoy his wealth : he had over sixty fine embroidered shirts . Mme Tamisier 's closet , situated on the first floor , contained a dressing-table with mirrors , creams and flasks of perfume . There is nothing here to suggest any modification of seventeenth-century hygiene , even though the toilet-table ' is now fitted with mirrors , drawers and perfumes.56 This inventory provides all the indications of classical hygiene : plentiful linen of good quality , objects emphasising attention to external appearance and to smell . Similarly , Rousseau 's accommodation at Montmorency was without a bidet in 1758.57 So was the accommodation of Collin , Mme de Pompadour 's steward , at her death in 1764.55 The distribution of bidets within chateaux is also significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were found only in the bedrooms or closets of the owners . This was the case at Malmaison in 1750,59 and at Montgeof-roy in 1775.60 // A more or less obvious sign of distinction , the existence of the bidet supposes a more intimate practice of cleanliness , modifying actions and attentions . The appearance of this item of furniture merits all the more interest in that it was neither preceded nor accompanied by any modification of the manuals of hygiene , even less of the manuals of manners , from which classical cleanliness had till then drawn its norms . It was after 1760 , for example , that certain texts began to evoke a sectional cleanliness , according to the part of the body . The treatise of Jacquin ( 1792 ) remains fairly euphemistic . It indicates local washing . The secret ' zones of the body exist in it , but it is still impossible to identify precise actions . The principle of such washing did not extend beyond generalities . Cleanliness requires that you wash various parts of the body fairly often , especially those where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a matter of delicacy as much as of health . ' 61 Le Conservateur de la sante ( 1763 ) , on the other hand , very deliberately named parts . It dwelt on smells , and on overheating . It described the risks run by not washing all these particular hidden surfaces . If perspiration or sweat remain on these parts ( the armpits , the groin , the pubic area , the genitals , the perineum , between the buttocks or the furrow ) the warmth inflames them , and , apart from the unpleasant smell which results and is spread about , part of these exhalations , and of the substance of which they are formed , is taken up by the absorbent vessels and carried into the circulation where it can only do harm by disposing the humours to putrefaction . " The image of a body which absorbs ( in this case , sweat which can flow back ' into the pores ) , persists , but with the use of water to care for certain parts ; these should be bathed regularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1772 . For some parts , washing was necessary . The care of the natural parts is an indispensable necessity . They must be washed every day , and aromatic plants or some spirit put in the water to be used for this purpose . ' 63 The insistence on feminine cleanliness was for the first time very explicit . The use of the bidet preceded these texts . It was , in fact , contemporaneous with another transformation , more import-ant because it concerned space and the intimate , that of closets for the conveniences ' . // What differentiated the great residences of Blondel in 173764 and 175265 from those of Le Muet a century earlier , 66 was a more precise distinction between the various parts of the building ; to the state and public apartments where noble social life was mainly lived were added more secluded areas designed for more intimate use.67 Offices with specific purposes were installed next to bedrooms : various closets , large and small , each with its specified function , for example for books or for washing ( rechauffoir , serre livres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms of the great seventeenth-century residences , usually multi-purpose , had , a century later , gained annexes . When Michel de La Jonchere transformed Malmaison in 1737,68 he increased the number of small closets ( chambees de garde-robe ) in a residence which had hitherto had only ground-floor passages and ante-chambers . The improvements effected at the residences of La Vrilliere in 1752 , of the Baron de Thiers in 1747 , and of Armini in 1748,69 involved similar changes . Rooms retained their proportions and their monumental scale . But round about them , between one room and the next , numerous places appeared . At the Hotel de La Vrilliere , a room in one wing had attached to it a wash-room , a closet and a back-stairs.70 At the Hotel de Belle-Isle , built by Bruant in the Rue de Bourbon in 1721 , one room had attached to it a wash-room , a convenience room ' , a closet and a privy.71 Comparing the buildings of the seventeenth century with those of his own times , Blondel emphasised their lack of closets ' and conveniences ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Mme de Maintenon had no special place where she could make her toilet . She slept in a room where the king continued to chat to his ministers . Her women came to undress ' 73 her at the foot of the bed . They then helped her slip into the bed , whose heavy hangings alone isolated her . It is this very intimacy which was affected by the changes to large mansions from 1730 on , and by the separation of state bedchamber and private // rooms . And it is this which was affected by the creation of rooms specially for the toilet ; rooms so specific that , by the 1760s , complete sets of bathroom furnishings were being sold , with walls and ceilings of painted cloth.74 These luxurious residences of the second third of the eighteenth century did not , however , change all individual relationships . The apartments of master and mistress generally remained separate . The familial ties between them were not necessarily closer . Men and women continued , for the most part , to occupy separate wings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not yet affect familial intimacy . Its real originality was to make possible greater personal intimacy . By their specialisation , the closets encouraged private attentions . The in-dividual now had time to himself . His actions were less directed towards external display . Other relationships , of oneself to oneself , became possible . A privacy was established within noble existence . In practice , the various models , those of the traditional aristocracy and those of the great financial bourgeoisie , fused , the latter importing into noble life a privatising dynamic quite new to it . The great residence of the 1730s , such as that of a Receiver-General of Finances like de Meulan , 76 or a minister like Rouille , 77 was inspired by the norms of the court at the very time it was displacing them . Ostentation gave way to a less demonstrative luxury . A larger space was set aside for private functions . Conveniences , boudoirs and closets were not constructed simply for show . Private man enjoyed there a new space . Nothing was more important to the financial elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing was more inevitable than a mutual influencing of their values . Thus , while noble pleasure tends to become privatised , a private person , once arrived , tries to conceal his origins by copying an aristocratic way of life . ' 78 The Hotel d'Evreux , which Mme de Pompadour had altered by Lassurance in 1752 , and the Hotel d'Armini , which 110 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . belonged to the financier , de Meulan , ended up by resembling each other.79 The washroom ( cabinet de toilette ) , the room of cleanliness ' ( cabinet de proprete ) , 80 the convenience room ( cabinet de commodite ) and the privy ( lieux a l'anglaise ) , all of which were to be found in rich Parisian mansions from the second third of the eighteenth century , seem to originate in this privatisation . The privies , clear signs of wealth , are particularly significant . They transformed the use of the commode by establishing a fixed and enclosed place for the natural functions . They applied the first technology to comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent smells spreading . Special places for intimate functions ? a new space had been created.81 The washroom , on the other hand , signified a new cleanliness , localised , certainly , but going beyond what was seen , and rendering reliance on clean linen alone inadequate . A new , and above all a private , practice ; the place counts here as much as the actions . And this whole range of activities was primarily based on personal sensations , developing without any theoretical justification . Intimate washing had begun . A more private space favoured its appearance . Particular objects indicated its presence . The bidet was the prototype of these innov-ations , but pottery bowls and jugs also helped to furnish these private places.82 Though important in that its cleanliness , though localised , achieved an intimate dimension , this transformation was nonetheless extremely limited . Not only was it confined to a few privileged people , but it had not yet completely emancipated itself from its traditional connections with appearance and good manners . The fact that the toilet could still for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial element in it remained the metamorphosis achieved by doing the hair and attending to the face . The dominant role of the visible had not been overthrown . The Due de Croy , present at the toilet of Mme de Pompadour , was fascinated as much by the aesthetic effect as by the proximity , quite institutionalised , such a situation // authorised . Nothing more delightful could be seen . 183 The operation was designed for visual effect . The toilet consisted above all of a patient transformation of the appearance . Its appeal was visible . Intimate cleanliness , discreet and little discussed , was tending in other directions . But this cleanliness still remained largely captive to the classical preoccupation with appearance . The essential aim was still display . Change would come elsewhere . It was by becoming more functional , for example , by finding other legitimations , in particular those of health and strength , and above all by confronting the mechanical images that water still bore , that cleanliness would change its meaning . Paradoxically , some of these changes were achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hygiene opposed to the values of appearance , though not , it must be emphasised , lacking in social connotations . 8 . Cold and the new vigour Bathrooms , bathtubs and washrooms show that the use of water gradually changed in the middle of the eighteenth century . For a privileged minority , at least , this meant a new cleanliness . But it remained very uneven , and the number of people affected very small . It remained allusive , even obscure ; water itself was not seen as it is today . Its warmth , its infiltration and its pressure all emphasised its uniqueness . It was an active substance , a dynamic milieu , acting on and traversing the body rather than washing it , stirring up its physiology and activating hidden energies . Interest in these mechanical effects was not confined to warmth and penetration . Many other effects could be imagined and other images were possible . Shocks and disturbances , for example , might be caused by the physical mass of water . Its mechanical effects seemed multifarious , and it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body 's parts , disturbances and internal movements remained the chief preoccupation . One particular idea was to play a role of especial importance since it reconciled numerous attractions , that is the shock effect of cold water . There was firstly a simple constant : cold contracted the body . Speculation about consequences ensued : such contractions might have a therapeutic effect by acting on the humours , or a quasi-moral effect by acting on the energy . Once again , hygiene became confused with preoccup-ations which went beyond it . The coldness of water became its most important quality , and interest was initially concentrated on the internal movements which contact with it set in motion . For many people in the second half of the eighteenth century , bathing and the use of water were dominated by the demand that it be cold . Does it not make men stronger and more robust ? " The concept rarely corresponded to actual practice , but it occupied an important role in theories and debate . 112 // These speculations supposed the transformation of many other assumptions . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reactions of the body ; a liquid as inhospitable as cold water , after all , submitted the body to an apparent evil in order to strengthen it . This belief in cold water , which seduced a new generation of hygienists from the middle of the eighteenth century , could only be arrived at after a long theoretical and cultural journey . IDEAS ABOUT COLD BATHS At first , before 1750 , it seemed to be exclusively a question of therapeutic effects . There were strange cures and edifying histories . A certain Capuchin , for example , was reputed to restore life to dying bodies by applications of iced water . The unnatural convulsions helped to renew energy , death retreated before the shocks of life . The Mercure of 1724 described this worthy ecclesiastic 's activities . Summoned to attend a dying man , he strove valiantly with the aid of the coldest of compresses . He applied towels dampened with ice ; death still mocked the good Capuchin and hung onto the patient . Eventually , the Capuchin called angrily for a block of ice weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ; upon my word , death let go , the patient revived , from top to toe ; he opened his eyes , recognised everybody and drank some water without more ado . 12 Such mechanical reactions are pre-scientific curiosities . There was clearly no shortage of credulity in the Mercure 's tale , and a barely concealed taste for the bizarre . Nature astonished ; its defiance seduced reason . The laboratories of the early eighteenth century , with their fumbling and their crude investigations of marvels , are not far away . Cures of this type , at all events , were widely publicised . The deeds of the Duc de La Force , who saved a poor wretch from dying from sunstroke , belong in this same category . Two travellers , come from afar , were crossing his lands during a terrible heat wave . The summer was exceptional ; it was boiling hot . They succumbed . One died some distance away , the other fell almost at his feet . The Duc de La Force ordered the sick man to be bathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covered him up , and waited : The patient came to , and well rested overnight , the next day recovered 114 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . enough to say that he felt very well . 13 The coldness of the water had triggered off the return to life . Noguez , who reported these events in 1730 , offered an explanation : the cold tempered . It calmed excessive agitation and contracted vessels dangerously dilated . It strengthened the parts by constricting them . The coldness of the water and its weight moderate and stop these prodigious movements , constricting the vessels and restoring their tone . 14 The explanation was extended , diversified , and applied to a multiplicity of ills ; the therapy gained in variety . Contracting the body in its deepest zones ( or so it was supposed ) , the cold conjured up images of the circulation of humours , the evacuation of viscera , and the reduction of tumours . It acted on solids and on fluxes . It caused masses to retract , compressed by its pressure . Organs contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no method as effective as cold when it is a matter of dissolving blood or evacuating glutinous matters attached to the linings of the vessels ; when you want to cleanse the glands and procure a more abundant filtration of animal spirits or make them run more rapidly in the nerves , when you need to induce urine or dissolve obstructions in the liver , the spleen , etc ... I This therapy exploited a series of images : conflict between what relaxed and what contracted , between what softened and what made hard . The role of the cold , in this case , comes as no surprise . It fortifies and contracts the fibres where they are too weak . " The cold bath thus orchestrated the movement of fluids and solids . In 1763 , Pomme immersed patients who were suffering from vapourish complaints . He wanted , by the cold , to combat their softness , to restore strength to their solids ' .7 In his single-minded application of the logic of hardening , Pomme sometimes went to extremes . He prolonged baths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in icy water . There was no trace here of earlier concerns . The discontinuity is all the more striking in that tradition favoured warmth ; it was hot water which had formerly been employed to expel the humours . But the implications went far beyond these new cures . The cold // bath in the eighteenth century was not only a therapeutic technique which broke with tradition , it became a technique of radical hygienists . Constricted and consolidated fibres , it was argued , were as likely to reinforce sick as healthy bodies . Because the code of vigour and resistance was directly concerned , so inevitably was health . The bath , for the first time , had an explicitly hygienic role , though less because it cleansed than because it strengthened , so powerful was the image of the mechanical actions of water . It was the effect on the bodily machine which counted , rather than its effect on the cleanli-ness of the skin . Many texts of hygiene from the second half of the eighteenth century promoted a vision of increasing toughness . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confront-ing the functioning of the body . Its coldness consolidated . Considerable advantages are attributable to cold baths : the sudden effect of cold on our bodies rapidly contracts the external parts and those which adjoin them ; by this means , the vibrations of the fibres become tauter , and the blood and the spirits circulate more rapidly . This is why cold baths are good for rarefying the blood and rendering it more fluid , for arousing the animal spirits and causing them to circulate more rapidly ... for facilitating the digestion and giving an appetite ; lastly , for rendering the body agile and vigourous. s Filaments and fibres grew hard , stiff and compressed . The whole hard ' structure of the body contracted , and was , as a result , consolidated . Books on health , formerly dominated by attention to regime ( in any case largely dietary ) , increasingly insisted on the stimulating virtues of cold ; cold water , along with lighter clothes , favoured frequent muscular tensions and reactions . Without it , the fibres will lose tone and the cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new significance . River bathing , for example , till then reserved for sport or a handful of cures , was seen , in the second half of the eighteenth century , as a means to health . It was both a strengthening exercise and an invigorating technique . The few Parisian baths , crudely installed next to boats equipped with ladders , 10 received renewed attention . They were mentioned , described , even recommended . The Descriptions de // Paris and the Guides des voyageurs , which had hitherto ignored such places , now indicated their locations , and even risked passing judgement . Jeze , for example , whose Etat de Paris was re-edited almost annually between 1754 and 1765 , adopted the thesis of the hygienists . Such baths could not but be the healthiest ' , ' 1 even if their appointments seemed crude . The places called baths consist of a boat completely covered by an awning near which there are fixed in the river twenty or so stakes in a circle about twelve fathoms long and two wide , enclosed with planks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder . " I The space was constricted and even cramped , no luxury , but invigorating actions . It was after 1760 in particular that this idea , fixed and unvarying , circulated amongst the hygienists : The cold bath , by condensing the solids , makes them resilient and strengthens them ' . 13 The body was subjected to the regime of hardened steel . The fibres were the focus ; their convulsive movements ' 14 induced hardening . The repeated references to this demonstrate the definitive abandonment of a medicine of humours , even though the action of the solids hardly passed beyond the threshold of elementary physics.l s But Maret set about calculating the shrinkage of a strip of animal skin exposed to the action of cold water , 16 whilst others immersed themselves in rivers and counted the acceleration of their pulses , or recorded certain physical reactions , " actions which go beyond a vague curiosity . These scientific aspirations , however , would have had little effect if they had been confined to simple physiological images . But the // cultural dimension was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mechanics of fibres . For some , cold water was above all an austere substance . The practice of the cold bath was above all an ascetic practice . The toughening induced was as much moral as physical . This hardening was intuitive rather than really explained ; it was a matter of mobilising energy and affirming firmness . Tronchin , for example , the doctor of the encyclopedists , followed by some of his Genevan admirers , did not explore the details of organic functioning , but made the cold bath a quasi-moral theme . As long as the Romans , on leaving the Champ de Mars , went and plunged into the Tiber , they ruled the world . But the hot baths of Agrippa and Nero reduced them gradually to slaves ... The conscript fathers were , therefore , quite right to oppose public baths , but the gilded company , infected with Asiatic luxury , triumphed over the opposition and the virtue of the conscript fathers . " " Tronchin , too , confidently prescribed long cures of cold baths , as warmth could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to virtue , and physical weakness to moral force . Physiology was subordinated to the Antique reference , as in Plutarch 's Lives , 19 with their celebration of primitive virtues . Rome , after all , was lost by a youth which disdaining to bathe in cold water , abandoned to softness , almost resembled our little masters in forsaking the physical exercise responsible for its strength and virtue ' .20 The savage played the same role in this type of text . He , too , provided excellent educational material . The inhabitants of the American Isthmus plunge into cold water when they are in a sweat and their health does not suffer . ' 21 Travel stories provided further 118 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . ammunition for such theories . The savage was not invariably idealised , but he was frequently made an example of rude habits and robust physique . Baths taken in the Amazonian or Canadian rivers provided a dramatic illustration of an energy and a resistance which could be transposed . It is a scientific fact that the American Indians plunge their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Rousseau who best expresses the essence of these voluntarist references . The Romans and Spartans of Plutarch , the Indians of La Hontan and Le Beau23 all appear as examples of rustic habits , their practices as examples of strength . Above all , they very obviously became polemical instruments . Multitudes of people wash new-born children in rivers or the sea as a matter of course . But ours , softened before even being born by the softness of their fathers and mothers , bring into the world a temperament already spoiled . 124 References to ancient heroes and to savages are interchangeable . Cold water was exploited till it came to symbolise a water which rendered in-vulnerable . The image of the Styx added its cultural and symbolic allusions , with its old Achillean models burdening college courses . The new hygienists all remembered their classical studies and exploited them in their own way . Harden their bodies ... Dip them in the Stygean water . ' 21 Thus , Emile was washed in ever colder water till he was accustomed even to water which was icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the ancient citizen as opposed to the present victim of despotism , simple habits as opposed to corruption , regeneration as opposed to decadence . Criticism of softness was also criticism of a city . We no longer have citizens . 121 Simple habits were deemed to offset the etiolation of the little masters ' . Romans and savages signified an elsewhere ' of liberty and strength . They were opposed to an aristocratic luxury now become enfeeblement ' , and to an arbitrary power which was implicitly denounced . They played , in fact , the role of counter-example . This critique dominated much thinking after 1789 . Antiquity offered a // model of liberty . If we imitate these free peoples . . . ' 28 It also offered a model of strength , with education assuming responsibility for training for war . I want fights , games , exercise , races and movement , far more than books and lessons . 129 Frugality as against luxury , energy as against feebleness , were coded references . Weakness , delicacy and effeminacy were the reflection of aristocratic artifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meaning which rendered the cold bath a complete counterpoise to the baths of noble mansions . These , with their enfeebling warmth , became , for the enlightened bourgeoisie , a sign of degeneracy . They had their origin in our taste for softness , an inevitable consequence of the luxury which is conquering all estates ' .30A useless and dangerous privilege , the hot bath was condemned as the practice of a decadent class . It , too , was symbolic , of the excess which corrupted and softened . Quite simply , it debased nature ' , 31 by inculcating a useless refinement of habits . The idle youth , submerged in the vapours ' mocked by Mercier , who dawdled from bath to dressing room and from dressing room to bath ' , 32 personified aristocratic laziness . Similarly , the delicate people who spend hour after hour in tepid baths and almost invariably pay for their perseverance by aches and pains , feebleness , or even total prostration 1 , 33 were obviously victims of their delicacy ' . But this was primarily a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand a refinement which weakened , on the other a simplicity which strengthened , a debilitating softness contrasted with an invigorating rigour . In each case , the words went far beyond their physiological meaning . Bourdieu has noted the beginnings of these changes in Montesquieu . Warm practices tended towards feebleness . Relax-ation relachement of the fibres , relaxation of habits , relaxation of vital strength and manly energy , cowardice ldchete : to engender 120 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . socially acceptable myths , it is enough , we can see , to let the words have their effect . ' 34 A new class , in the face of aristocratic models , invented a strength . It did so by reactivating vigour and dynamism . It justified itself . It definitively separated a new asceticism from conspicuous indolence . By the austerity of coldness , it signalled its superiority over pleasures judged too indulgent . It emphasised rigour the better to increase cultural and social distances . Lack of sensibility and energy became the dominant lessons . It was these that Grimm 's correspondence said should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican habits and the moral philosophy of the ancients . ' 35 Cold was only a sign of a major shift in values . What mattered was the discontinuity in physical codes and moral values ; at a deeper level , it was a transformation of a whole social frame of reference , with strengths imagined where they did not exist and decadence limited to a defined milieu . The references to bathing were only a pretext . Their impact was primarily on the imagination ; they conjured up visions of manifest powers and impressed by heroic examples . But the cold bath was usually an exclusively literary conviction ; it did not abruptly invade bourgeois habits in the wake of these hygienic arguments . It remained for the most part a rhetorical reference , an abstract rule , an intellectual argument , not an actual practice . Millot , still , in 1801 , displaying the utopian spirit of certain revolutionary debates , conceived the idea of an establishment which would be regenerating ' . He proposed that a circular place should be constructed in the Seine , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ages and sizes . Frequent periods in the river would ensure that they grew progressively stronger . It was not a question of swimming , but simply of a spell in the cold . The pedagogic and public application of the cold bath would at last be achieved . Whenever the government wishes , it can change the feeble constitution of our Parisians , and make them as robust as our German neighbours : all that is needed is the construction of a bath at the edge of the Seine , near the Invalides ; this bath would consist of an elipse cut into the waste land on the bank which would be dug out to four feet only , and constructed like an // amphitheatre , in stages each raised only four or five inches above the next , to seat children of all ages after teething.36 In 1801 , Millot saw his arguments as still innovatory . He thought little had been achieved . Nothing , it seems , had changed in the militant and persuasive tone , except the appeal to public authority and an obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of France the practice of the cold bath , and within fifteen years , the government would begin to see the beneficial effect of such baths . ' 37 Explicitly evoking Rome and Sparta , and proposing quite unrealistic demands , Millot 's formulas were doomed to failure . This sort of general and compulsory bath could never be imposed . It did , however , affect a limited public who were sensible of its value as an example , and of the social demarcation on which the idea was based . WHAT PRACTICES ? Mme de Maraise , associate of Oberkampf and enlightened woman of the world , was an admirer of the hygienists . This friend of Tissot , 38 who had read his texts with passion , and who invited him to Jouy in 1780 , reveals both her convictions and their limits . She entertained no doubts , for example , about the value of cold baths , but was cautious about taking one . For this sociable and dynamic member of the bourgeoisie , who said she had never bathed , the cold bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its practice . She spoke of it in the future rather than the present . Your experience should be a better guide than my poor little theory , which only I can vouch for , never having tried any sort of bath , and when my health permits , it will be in the Seine that I start . ' 39 She bathed for the first time over a dozen years later , in the Seine . She took two or ? // three baths a year there , though still sometimes abstaining for several seasons . Thus practice followed genuine conviction , but remained irregular and infrequent . On 12 September 1812 , Mme de Maraise alludes incidentally to this irregularity . The 28 of last month , you came to my house just as I was going out on various errands , and in particular for my third river bath this year , which I had n't found time for since 1809.140 This friend of Oberkampf was more pressing where children were concerned . She believed in baths which completely submerged the body , head included . She promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she reveals indirectly some reserve and some difficulties . I would like our little ones to be plunged into cold water like English children , but they must not have a maid like the one they have for this operation , nor , I am inclined to say , a father like theirs , albeit he is quite capable of making prejudice bow to experience ; but when I myself was about to take a cold bath , he was absolutely insistent that my head should be excluded . ' 41 The insistence on total immersion reveals that cleanliness was not the main object . In fact , Tissot , from whom Mme de Maraise proudly drew her asceticism , implied this . One of his statements is particularly revealing . Weak children are the ones most in need of washing ; the very robust can do without . . . ' 42 Cold water , it is clear , washed less than it strengthened . It was primarily an ordeal . Furthermore , it was tempting to treat it as pure theory , which , to an extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination by creating new visions of physical qualities . It was not always necessary to go further . Nevertheless , actual examples of cold baths are by no means entirely lacking . Mercier noted a tangible change . It particularly concerned children , and those of the enlightened bourgeoisie , soon influenced by this new code . This infatuation paralleled that which simultaneously condemned swaddling clothes and corsets . Children are better raised than formerly . They are plunged into cold baths , we have adopted the happy custom of clothing them lightly , and without binding.143 And the practice spread beyond a narrow enlightened circle . Exiled to Louveciennes after the death of Louis XV , Mme du Barry embraced this new behaviour . She took a cold bath every day , changed her diet and wore fewer clothes . This asceticism on the part Cold and the new vigour 123 of the former favourite is the exact opposite of that which Mme de Montespan had inflicted on herself a century earlier ; 44 not in this case a rigour which mortified , but a rigour which strengthened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , her statements remained allusive and intuitive , but an acquired ' robustness was at the heart of her assertions . Dufort de Cheverny recorded her enthusiasm , not to say her ingenuousness , after a chance meeting . Her pretty face was rather flushed . She told us that she took a cold bath every day . She showed us that under her long cloak she wore only a shirt and a wrap . She absolutely insisted that we touched her flanks to prove to us how little the cold affected her . ' 45 A different example , but also evidence of actual practice , was the invention of the Comte de Milly , member of the Academy of Sciences , who in 1776 proposed a complicated mechanical bathtub . In this , the water was set in motion to produce a current comparable to that of a river . This flux added its pressures to those caused by the cold ; it accelerated the series of shocks . The expectations of mechanical effects had never been so great . It reveals the prominence recently acquired by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , and its vaguely idealised dynamic pressures . This bathtub augments the action of the water on the surface of the skin by producing , after only a few moments of immersion , a greater effect than is obtained in many days by the ordinary method ' .46 The word method ' , and the calculation of length ( from several minutes to many days ) show , without it being explicitly stated , that it was a matter of causing physiological effects as much , if not more , than of washing . Yet another example is provided by the passion with which Benjamin Franklin could speak of the river-baths and tonic ' immersions which he regularly enjoyed after 1760 . The example is particularly interesting because Franklin emphasised both a veritable infatuation and a substitute practice . Nothing equalled the virtues of the cold bath , but the resulting shock might disturb and unsettle the body . It might even harm certain constitutions . Franklin dealt with this difficulty by resorting to a very simple alternative : the air bath . Rising early each morning , he opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENETRATED . . . moved around naked inside the house for an hour or a half-hour , according to the season ' .47 Cold air apparently had the same effect as cold water ! The relationship between cold and cleanliness , it must be said , was in this case very tenuous . Certain institutions , finally , employed cold water for its strengthening properties . The rules of the royal military schools , for example , consequent upon the reforms of the Comte de Saint-Germain , introduced it in 1776 . It was a seasonal practice , still , but one which paved the way to more regular local ablutions . The future soldier was to be toughened by exploiting the virtues of water . The pupils of all ages should be accustomed to washing their hands and faces daily in cold water . If there is a river or a stream near to the college , where they can bathe without danger , they should be taken there from time to time in good weather . ' 48 Cold water had its equivalents in clothes , the way rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milieu which regulated everything : To this end , they should often be let go bare-headed and lightly covered .. . The pupils should be given only one bed-cover even in the coldest season . ' 49 This explains the several buckets installed for foot-baths , about 1780 , in the courtyard of Mans-Neuf in the College Louis-le-Grand.50 The use actually made of them , however , is difficult to discern , as it escapes the rules of the civil colleges . All the more so , as at Brienne , for example , though a military college , the inventory of 1788 mentions only two bath-containers for the legs ' .51 It was , nevertheless , chiefly the outlook of educational institutions which had been transformed . In his comments to accompany the proposal and programme for the establishment he created in 1777 , and which he wanted to serve the important employees of the State ' , Verdier enthused about river-baths and swimming . They promoted health and vigour . But they were too risky for the pupils . In Paris , the pupils should never be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any dangerous place . ' S2 At the College Sainte-Barbe , on the other // hand , as at several other institutions towards the end of the century , the pupils were taken to bathe in the Seine at the onset of the summer.53 Meanwhile , a new establishment had seen the light of day : the school of swimming , opened on the Pont de la Tournelle in 1785 by Turquin . Many abortive attempts to found similar schools had been made since that of Arnaud in 1777.54 They had run into financial obstacles or failed to gain approval . Turquin obtained the endorsement not only of the provost of the merchants , but of the Academy of Sciences and the Royal Medical Academy . The concept had gained acceptance . The quest for so many guarantees confirms his ambitious designs ; Turquin wanted to create a hygienic establishment . Neither technical apprenticeship nor the utilitarian role of swimming were neglected , but the aims of the institution were more ambitious , and other objectives dominant . What mattered most was movement in cold water , and , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been an apt pupil ; swimming accentuated the effects of cold.55 It was an additional instrument to accelerate the mechanical effects of liquid ; it facilitated the stimulating action of the bath . The theory had become a commonplace . It appeared in the Encyclopedie of 1765,56 and other texts expanded and developed it . Swimming gave the water more force , while reconciling suppleness and tension . The organs , in consequence , were more thoroughly massaged , even pummelled . The agitation completed the mechanical action . Swimming has an advantage over a simple bath , because the vigorous , repeated movements made to overcome the resistance of the water are more conducive to making it penetrate the interior and give suppleness to the muscular activity of all parts of the body , to promoting the easiest and most // favourable secretion and excretions , in a word , to setting the seal of health on the finest constitutions.57 Swimming , Turquin insisted , accentuated the salutary effects of the river-bath ' .58 It was its culmination . The school of swimming was , in fact , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 1785 , the establishment was an instant success . Turquin planned a new and supervised space : four boats , firmly anchored , together bounded an enclosed rectangle , the first Parisian swimming-bath . Cabins were provided . The clientele was select . This is shown by the cost of individual subscriptions : ninety-six livres a year , first class , forty-eight livres for the second.59 The price was high . Comparing it with taxes speaks volumes : in 1790 , for example , the patriotic contribution was claimed from those with incomes higher than four hundred livres a year , reckoned to mark the threshold of easy circumstances . The subscription alone amounted to a quarter of such an income . The school 's clientele could not be drawn from the common people . This is confirmed by some of its private customers.6 ? The Duc d'Orleans sent his sons there in 1788 , a significant decision in that the Duc had for long adopted the sensibility of the enlightened bourgeoisie . For purely political reasons , the policy of the Orleans , a cousin and rival branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cultural terrain was all the more import-ant in that it could appear innocent ' .6 ' The future Philippe-Egalite knew how , in this regard , to make a public demonstration of certain attitudes . Tronchin and Desessarts , 62 for example , were the Orleans family doctors , and Mme de Geniis , governess to the three sons , scrupulously applied the rules of the hygienists . Attending the school of swimming was a clear sign of an adherence . And the cold bath , though limited , was no longer simply a matter of theory . Cold and the new vigour 127 VISIONS OF INVIGORATED BODIES Such practices , though still rare , confirmed the status of cold water after 1760 . Though an element in a new type of bathing , it was not really a question of cleanliness . Too many other aims were involved , and too many justifications . It was not a neutral substance , but something still surprising and strange , which set in train multiple effects , and was difficult to control . An almost unnatural milieu for the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actual practices are significant . They emphasise that the hygienic recommendations had gone beyond simple literary references or rhetoric . What is more important , they emphasise how the public concerned was directly influenced by an enlightened bourgeoisie , exploiting concepts of vigour and robustness . It is the social significance of these concepts which best enables us to understand how they were viewed and evaluate their impact . It is they which express most clearly the birth of an entirely new image of the body . They are its most suggestive expression . The cold bath was primarily , and in essence , the indicator of a code , hitherto unknown , of bodily efficiency . The transformation in bathing children is particularly revealing and provides the clearest expression of the new code . Baths for children were rare in France in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , though they existed ( they were common , in particular , immediately after birth ) . They involved two procedures , both of which were expressly affected by the changes of the second half of the eighteenth century , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping up the pores with sticky substances to give better protection and strength . Concern with the bodily openings was dominant . Ambroise Pare expressed it unequivocally : The child at birth should be cleaned with oil of roses or bilberries to remove the dirt and excrements which it bears on its skin ; also to close the pores so that afterwards its constitution will be rendered firmer . ' 63 The complex relationship between bathing and firmness was not new . It was not the concept of strengthening which was original in the arguments of Tronchin and his friends . There was a long tradition of wishing to strengthen children 's bodies , which were manipulated in the desire to achieve hardness . The body itself , however , was passive , and submitted to the protective hand . To make it firm meant 128 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . primarily closing the pores ; strengthening it meant coating it or stopping up the holes . The analogy was with objects which needed to be closed . An alien hand worked on the skin , hardened it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick oils , waxes , salts , even dross of saltpetre . Once the pores had been treated , the flux of the humours , by their movement , made possible new strengthening , thickening or fluidity . The hand manipulated the skin and controlled its outlets . The myth of the cold bath , however , turned this picture on its head . It supposed a body endowed with a pre-existing power , not an inert mass . It possessed innate resistance , internal resources , hidden strengths . There exists no other natural warmth for a child than its own , and that is enough . ' 64 To plunge it into cold water , then , was to trust in precisely that obscure energy which the preceding century had denied . The body was no longer a passive substance ; from its first day , it possessed an inherent strength which only had to be liberated . The ways of augmenting this were equally new . There was , for example , no longer recourse to an alien hand ; strength came from within . It came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these repeated contractions which fortified , not external manipulation . Strength came from within the body . The image was sometimes intuitive , giving priority to hidden strengths , or dreaming of Roman toughness ; physical and moral designs combined to confront hostile matter . The image was sometimes more concrete , detailing how cold instigated this vital force . It was a matter of discovering particular organic reactions , playing on the originality of the living being , recognising a physiolo-gical autonomy , describing this reactive ' place . Already , according to the Encyclopedia , the cold bath instigated a precise physical re-sponse . By keeping the vessels in a highly constricted state , and by thus achieving an increased strength , the cold bath occasions more action and more effort in consequence on the part of the motor power to conquer them , hence the augmentation of the progressive move-ment of the humours . ' 65 The same ideas are found in Maret ; the irritability attributed to muscle by Haller enabled him to evoke an autonomy of physical reaction . Cold had become a stimulant . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only emphasised the importance of the sequences . The effect of these actions is proportionate to the force of the stimulants which set them // going . . . The effect of the cold in condensing the solids and fluids increases their force . ' 66 Similar ideas are found in Hufeland , who even divided the dynamic polarities between external ' and internal ' , those which assisted the body , and those born of it . Bodily strength came not from the hand which sustained it , but from an invisible internal energy ; it was a question of interpellation rather than assistance . Cold was simply an appeal to these latent strengths . I know nothing so pernicious , nothing which encapsulates so perfectly the idea of weakness and infirmity as the characteristic of human nature become almost general in our time , of acting from the exterior on the interior . . . We must remember that , by constant and often excessive warmth , we do everything , from the beginning , to relax the skin and deprive it of its strength . ' 67 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . It replaced the actions designed to reinforce . External assistance was succeeded by internal action , management of something inert by a challenge to the living . The reversal of the image also makes it easier to understand the possibility , even the success , of inoculation in the second half of the eighteenth century . Inoculation , after all , worked through bodily resistance ' . This practice , in which the skin was cut open for some purulent fragments of smallpox spots to be inserted , supposed a confidence just as obscure , but also just as real , in a reactive organic strength . The hygiene of the cold bath closely resembled this new preventive practice . All the defences that the body opposed to sickness had to be re-thought . Operating through the openings , or through the mechanics of the coverings , was no longer all that was possible . Attempts to make clothing into a barrier against unwhole-some air were in part out-dated . The body was no longer simply a passive machine . Other strategies existed . It became possible to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once again , internal and active dispositions . This did not happen by chance ; the hygienists of the cold bath and those of inoculation were often the same people . It comes as no surprise that Tronchin inoculated the Orleans children in 1756 . Inoculation , like cold , supposed an initial resistance to illness , and it was operating on this resistance that produced strength.68 The concept of the cold bath thus only illustrates a profound // transformation of the images regulating the employment and the strength of the body . The real change was social : the belief in an autonomous strength , invented by a bourgeoisie confident of its own physical power , and confident , above all , of powers totally independent of the ties and codes of blood . This strength was present in all bodies ; it should therefore be solicited , trusted and put to work . It had to be believed in . It hardly mattered that it was more in the mind than a matter of actual practice . The belief grew and spread . The body concealed powers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , which in the second half of the eighteenth century discredited the aristocratic code of appearance and manners . The process was all the more important in that cleanliness now derived from that which liberated . To be clean was soon to mean removing whatever fixed and constrained the appearance , in favour of whatever freed it . 9 . Nature and artifice The rupture which , especially after 1760 , dissociated the new vigour ' from aristocratic softness ' , was accompanied by an antithesis with greater significance for cleanliness : the contrast between nature and artifice . A nature itself contrived , certainly , but whose success , especially by the end of the century , extended well beyond the ranks of the bourgeoisie . When the Bar onne d'Oberkirch left Versailles in the small hours of the morning of 9 June 1782 , after the ball given for the future Tzar of Russia , she emphasised almost in spite of herself , how prevalent was this theme in aristocratic culture . The description she gave of the peasants encountered on the road to Paris , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are shot through by an image of nature . Day had broken and the peasants were starting on their daily labour . What a contrast between their calm and contented faces and our tired visages : the rouge had fallen from our cheeks , the powder from our hair . The return from a party is not a pretty sight , and can inspire many philosophical reflections in those with a mind to it . ' The natural ' reference here is without social implications . The Baronne was far from calling into question her milieu . She was quite capable , on occasion , of mocking the philosophes . She detested Rousseau . She laughed at the education given to the Orleans children by Mme de Genlis . But , on the themes of the body and of appearance , the memoirs she left in 1787 are hopelessly ambivalent ; there is an obsessive interest , for example , in the tools which traditionally composed noble faces , but denigration of these same tools ; a fascination for powders , starch and wigs , yet a denunciation of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmetics damaging or clogging up the skin , of artifices serving to spoil what nature has made ' .2 The gradual transformation of attitudes towards the materials employed 131 // to produce classical appearance had , by the end of the century , reached even court circles . There can be no doubt that this critique had originally possessed social significance . It had long mocked the little masters , elegant and elaborately got-up ' .3 It was against them that the crescendo of accusations against artifice , and against appearance deemed too elaborate or affected , had been directed . It had been through them , also , that the aristocratic code of manners had been perceived . The opposition between vigour and delicacy could only play variations on these emergent themes : simplicity as opposed to affectation , spon-taneity as opposed to disguise . Wigs , powdered heads and coloured substances on the cheeks all fell into disfavour in their turn because Nature ' was deemed to be lost to the point of degeneracy . They were all reprehensible signs of luxury . Only weakness and vanity were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has unfortunately seen fit to invent and which the sensuality of the rich employs in their toilet with a profusion as dangerous as it is reprehensible ' .5 It was because they were also the subject of a social critique that cosmetics signified softness and debility . These themes were all the more important in that by restoring a distance between nature and artifice , they overthrew cleanliness 's frame of reference . Calling into question the code of appearances and dress , for example , denouncing the primacy of vestimentary values , was to affirm other values , issuing from within . The condition of the skin , for example , was more important than the substances which coloured it , and natural hair than the various contrivances which substituted for it . It was in polemicising against worldly sophisti-cation that Rousseau insisted on Sophie 's cleanliness . He made it an alternative to artificial coquetry , a sign written on her person ' itself.6 He elaborated on it , insistently extending his own dreams of trees and gardens , playing on the metaphor of sap and roses , exhausting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the perfume of flowers and her husband breathed nothing so sweet as her // breath . " Cleanliness was opposed to vain affectation ' .8 It was not at this point contrasted with loathsome dirt . There was no question , in 1762 or for many years after , for example , of attacking the deficiencies of the poor , or of assessing the danger of a filthy ' peasantry . A whole range of practices had yet to be defined as deficient . It was not in opposition to this that militant cleanliness was born . It was a paradoxical response to excessively elaborate dress and over-refined artifice . It stood against superficial appearances , and , above all , against the status of display . The issue , it must be remembered , was one of distinctions . It was here that there began a very special rapprochement between hygiene and cleanliness . HEALTH VERSUS COSMETICS Before even being a simple critique of fashion , the denunciation of the excess of powder and pomades raised questions of health . By preventing the issue of the humours , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The explanation was mechanical ; the natural fluxes might be impeded inside heads plastered with diverse substances . The congealed powders might act as a barrier . The fluxes might be compelled to search out different outlets , or corrupt the blood , or swamp other organs , or induce pain , or multiply ills . They might cause unexpected swellings and spread inflammations . There was no telling where they might travel , and poison : The perspiration intercepted by the accumulation of powder congealed with pomade and sweat flows back into the neighbouring parts and causes catarrhs , disorders of the throat , the ears , the eyes . . . I have seen a boy of ten die from an abcess on his throat caused by his dirtiness . It had been so long since he had been combed . . . The humour had flowed back into his throat and he died of the abcesses it had formed. ? The accumulation of cosmetics upset the internal relationships . In consequence disequilibriums were created and strength sapped ; they // disturbed . They could produce a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .10 As with coldness , there was an affirmation of forces and functions which artifice seemed likely to stifle , and a simultaneous emphasis on the danger of a concern limited exclusively to appearance . Beyond appearance , other issues and , in particular , other forces , were at stake . The mass of pomades and powders that most wig-makers employ . . . weigh down the head , block the pores and frequently cause migraines and disorders of the head which turn the hair white or soon cause it to fall out . ' " To suppress or reduce artifice was thus to permit a liberation , a less constrained attitude ; it was to enfranchise , to refuse a constraint . The pound of powder and pomade which the least movement caused to fall onto the shoulders ' , for example , became too much of an encumbrance.12 These criticisms joined forces with those of corsets and stifling clothes.13 A chemistry still in its infancy also influenced these ideas . The argument was one of substances which corroded , their acridity can irritate the nerves ' .14 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Might they not attack the skin and cause it to suffer irreparable damage ? One should fear , in particular , substances made of lead , ceruse , lead vinegar , magisterium , flowers of bismuth or other such , which are , in truth , the most beautiful of all whites , but which , by their saline , poisonous , arsenical , indelible constituents incurably impair and spoil the complexion ' . ' s Cinnabar similarly wore away ' the skin . " There were sulphurous substances ' 17 alleged to threaten the chest and the eyes . Chemistry came to the aid of nature . In 1789 , the Encyclopedic methodique was unequivocal . Most cosmetics are made of minerals which are more or less harmful , but always corrosive , and disastrous effects are inseparable from their use . ' 18 Eventually , at the end of the eighteenth century , the arguments of // hygienists and followers of fashion converged . Powder and cosmetics no longer enjoyed their former role . The faces of the nobility , of women in particular , lost their paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duc de Levis mocked a duchess glimpsed at the house of the Marechal de Richelieu , whose face was covered with a thick layer of white , set off by two patches of brilliant red ' .19 Similarly , Mme de Genlis laughed at her grandmother , who had recourse to an enormous quantity of red and white ' .20 In the same way , a certain dancing-master , a fine man admirably coiffed and powdered with white ' , 21 became , by 1787 , simply ridiculous . The Marquise de La Tour du Pin described him calculating every gesture to prevent his powder falling . She immediately detected hesitation in his manners and constraint in his expressions . She deemed his neck too stiff and his features too well-defined.22 Crayon was more suited to the portraits of Vigee-Lebrun after 1780 than to those of Boucher or Nattier , with their greater contrasts , a few decades earlier.23 The change shows most dramatically in children 's clothes . The opposition between vigour and softness , simplicity and affectation , nature and artifice , applied here with especial force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plasticity of childhood , the standards were clearer . One no longer sprinkles their heads with white as was hitherto the practice . They used to be quite disfigured with those pomaded rolls , those curls , and all that paraphernalia . Nothing was more ridiculous than these tiny creatures with a purse , a hat under the arm and a sword at their side . Since the revolution in hair , children have their hair styled in a round , well cut , very clean and powdered.24 The sentiment was common . Mercier used similar words to emphas-ise fair hair hanging naturally ' .25 Noble and bourgeois children were no longer the same after 1780 . The language of fashion explicitly exploited the word nature ' . White powder hardened ' and disfigured ' .26 It falsified features , rather than flattered them . For those who wanted to retain powdered 136 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . hair at whatever cost , however , better to use a light-coloured cosmetic , lightly sprinkled . This respected the natural colouring , whilst giving greater softness to the face ' .27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , the Affiches et Annonces de Paris cautiously refrained from recommending any but vegetable ' whites and reds.28 Fashionable man was incapable of condemning cosmetics outright . Such advice demonstrates the extent to which the argument between nature and artifice had , in the second half of the eighteenth century , transformed the criteria of distinction . It was precisely this transformation which could change concep-tions of cleanliness . It was the explicit attention paid to what was behind appearance which could call into question the long relation-ship between cleanliness and dress , imposing on clothes other criteria than simply those of show . Surfaces and perfumes could no longer stand alone . The scene had changed . Classical distinction , that of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries , was no longer achieved through profile but through structure . The assumptions underlying it began to collapse . The meaning of the word cleanliness changed in its turn . The Encyclopedia discovered this in 1765 : Cleanliness should not be confused with the quest for luxury , affectation in dress , perfumes , scents ; all these exquisite attentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too inconvenient for everyday life , they betray the motive which gave them birth . ' 29 Cleanliness was no longer exclusively expressed in vestimentary signs . It had a more directly bodily manifestation ? a significance obvious today , but which it took this lengthy attack on the dominance of appearance and profile to realise . Cleanliness was so much the less dependent on superficial appearance in that it could undo it . Just one example , in this series of displacements : the interpretation given by Mercier to the changing faces . It seems as if short hair intends to take over the empire : cleanliness , convenience , saving in time , perhaps even health , demand this fashion , because the head needs to breathe , which means it has to be perfectly clean . ' 30 Wigs and powders , profiles and perfumes were no longer the foundation of cleanliness , they depended on it . In the same way , recourse to make-up required a prior condition . Mercier sang its praises when listing the whites and Nature and artifice 137 the reds , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style : cleanliness , cleanliness , cleanliness . ' 31 THE DECEPTION OF PERFUME With perfume there changed a major reference point whose signific-ance is particularly revealing . An entirely surface effect , perfume could now only deceive . The smells belong less to cleanliness than to a certain depraved taste or a certain concept of fashion , of which the little masters are the arbiters. ' 32 Criticisms multiplied of the smell of the essences and the powders perfumed with amber ' , 33 of the danger ' of aromatics , 34 of the troubles and the vapours ' provoked by musk , 35 all substances which enervated and enfeebled , all practices which went against nature . This extended even to innocent concoc-tions of rose petals , which could make you fall into a decline ' .36 Bomare , in his Dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle of 1764 , seemed to delight in offering proofs of such affectations , comparing the limited sense of smell of man with that of the animals . Infirmity had only one source : the excess of strong odours with which men are constantly surrounded ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not without irritation , to that fury with which we try to destroy ourselves ' , 38 by recklessly seeking out smells . Heady perfume was effeminate . To which was added the suspicions about cleanliness which it might arouse ; just as false beauty ' produced an effect more repellant than the worst ugliness ' .39 The artifice of perfume also seemed poles apart from the bourgeois spirit which was soon to triumph . Perfume vanished and evaporated , a symbol of waste and loss . It was not only superficial , it was evanescent . It was squandered . It dispersed with a fleeting and irreversible volatility ; the antithesis of accumulation and saving . 138 FROM WATER THAT PENETRATED . . . Perfume diffused and escaped . This instability was now a source of disappointment . These criticisms have been vividly commented on by Corbin . There is something intolerable for the bourgeois in ex-periencing the disappearance in this manner of the hoarded products of his labour . Perfume , accused of betraying softness , disorder and a taste for pleasure , is the antithesis of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of appearance . A similar disqualification inevitably applied to certain actions hitherto thought of as purifying . Before , perfume could correct body smells by modifying their intimate substance . It combatted unpleas-ant odours because it attacked their very substance . In a sense , it even washed . Its application alone cleansed and purified . It actually transformed the source of the unpleasant air . But it now lost all its value 141 in acting against unwholesome air and noisome emanations . Another element in the toilet and even in hygienic practices disappeared . The effect of perfume was no longer to purify . It did not act on the very essence of the air . And , above all , it could not reach the source of the unpleasantness . All it does is substitute a pleasant smell for a fetid smell , it only masks the smell , it does not destroy putrid miasmas. 142 At the very most its role was to disguise . The preferable response was to suppress the source of the evil smells and renew the surrounding atmosphere . It was better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than burn perfume there.43 Scientific argument and sensibility converged . Perfume was even less effica-cious in that it misled by its showy effects . It was doubly deceptive ; it both enfeebled and gave an illusion of a real correction of unhealthi-ness . Frivolity and impotence converged . The pot-pourris so delight-ful in their refinement and the combination of their spices are often more inclined to harm the delicate , empty and exhausted brains of those idle deities than restore the freshness of the air . 144 THE INTERNAL VERSUS APPEARANCES There remain certain exceptions to these denunciations , but they only confirm in their own way the appeal of nature . Mme Necker // dreamed , in her memoirs , of essences simple ' enough to imitate the smell of earth dampened by rain ' .41 Jaucourt , fulminating in the Encyclopedie against aromatics and cosmetics , excepted certain extracts of flowers and fruits such as , for example , strawberry water , lavender water , water distilled from beans 1 .46 Jacquin , though exploiting the almost moral censure of perfume , also suggested several exceptions : We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sweet and agreeable and compatible with cleanliness : eau-de-vie of lavender is one . 147 The pursuit of nature sometimes even imposed more complex artifices , such as the employ-ment , in 1782 , of tiny phials concealed in the hair , so that natural , fresh flowers could keep their stems in water.48 The perfume was meant to espouse the energy of the sap . Cleanliness was associated with spring-like essences , with things brimming with life , with , most of all , a bodily strength . It meant dynamism and vigour . A new autonomy was attributed to the body ; it was desirable to separate it from its array of protectors and develop its innate qualities , accord a value to a vitality independent of dress and get-up . Freshness , cleanliness and even style , all now had organic conno-tations . Here lay the new worth . It stood in opposition to the old values of appearance , affirming a strength which was more internal . This is not to say , obviously , that this value was clearly defined , even less that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little washing , for example , in Rousseau , apart from a handful of references to cold baths in infancy . Water is not mentioned in connection with Julie 's toilet . The transformation operating here was more a question of simplicity . She rediscovers the art of enhancing her natural graces without concealing them ; when she emerged from her toilet , she was dazzling . 141 Nor was much said about the socially sanitary role of cleanliness , even though cleanliness was being so obviously promoted . Tissot himself , listing in 1765 the causes of sickness amongst the people , mentioned drunkenness and excessive labour , but neither cleanliness nor dirt.so But the opposition between nature and artifice , and between
