It expects that division to be profitable by this month , Mr. Murchison said . However , if the United Mine Workers , whose national contract expires March 27. goes on strike , the company looks for further operating losses in the coal division during the second quarter . " at least for the duration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent losses , it has been in default on bank loan agreements since Dec. 31. but the banks have waived the defaults . " As a result of the closing of the private placement , the company is no longer in default under its bank loan agreements . " it said . Mr. Murchison said the company has had preliminary discussions with three major companies concerning the sale or joint venture of its Illinois coal operations . He said . however . " the company can not predict the possibility of entering into serious negotiations with any company concerning the possible sale of the Illinois coal properties . " He also noted that the company is continuing to ship coal to a utility with which it has been having a dispute because the utility has said it intends to cancel its long-term contract for coal . He also said the company has three exploratory oil and gas wells awaiting testing and that while each has shown signs of hydrocarbons , no determination has been made of commercial potential and the company ca n't predict when testing will be complete .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
