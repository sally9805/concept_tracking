HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS <P> George Henderson ( John Lithgow ) , his wife Nancy ( Melinda Dillon ) and the kids , Sarah and Ernie , are out on a camping trip when  --  Sasquatch !  --  their car hits a large furry creature . Sure enough , it 's Bigfoot , the legendary man- beast . And sure enough , Harry , as George dubs him , is one more cuddly pal from the Spielberg Toy Factory . He smiles and mewls winsomely , presents Sarah with a bouquet , and sleeps in the Hendersons ' living room with Ernie , a teddy bear and the family dog . As Harry might say , Uggghhh ! Director and Co-Author William Dear , who helmed a funny segment of Spielberg 's Amazing Stories , here apes his mentor and libels him . He has taken the E.T . formula and created its reductio ad nauseam . <P> GARDENS OF STONE <P> Pity the boys who go to war ; pity the men who ca n't . For Clell Hazard ( James Caan ) , the Korean glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 , and instead of preparing G.I.s for Viet Nam , he leads an honor guard at Arlington National Cemetery . All show , no go . But in Private First Class Jackie Willow ( D.B. Sweeney ) , Clell can see a surrogate son and his best younger self . He knows Jackie will shine in war or go down in flames  --  an epitaph for Icarus . Alas , Gardens of Stone goes down in smoke ; unlike other , more delirious failures by its director , Francis Coppola , the new picture goes not far enough . This requiem for a young man lost to war sleepwalks like a family mourner ; it plays taps to its own best intentions . <P> THE STEPFATHER <P> The all-American dad is a psychopathic murderer . In his suburban home , with his new wife ( Shelley Hack ) and stepdaughter ( Jill Schoelen ) , Jerry Blake ( Terry O'Quinn ) exudes the righteous good cheer of another famous insurance salesman , Jim Anderson in Father Knows Best . He may even believe the myth he is peddling . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he should love . By the end of this fine-handed thriller , the stairs leading from living room to bedroom are littered with bloody archetypes : mom at the bottom , stepdad at the top , daughter in between poised to destroy the black widower . Donald E. Westlake based his sleek script on the case of a New Jersey serial killer . Director Joseph Ruben brings his no-nonsense classicism to what could have been just another tabloid horror story . And Schoelen is the most appealing teen in recent movies . But the triumph is O'Quinn 's . With his a- mite-too-wide smile , unctuous pieties and neatly calibrated spasms of rage , he creates a paradigm head of the postnuclear family : an evangelist of father love and blood lust .
