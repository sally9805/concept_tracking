Plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan , 41 , has committed no crime . Yet for almost two years she has been in prison . Reason : she refuses to permit her six-year- old daughter Hilary to visit the child 's father , Eric Foretich , 46 , who she alleges raped Hilary during previous visits . Judge Herbert Dixon sent Morgan to prison for contempt when she refused to reveal Hilary 's whereabouts . Relief may be on the way : prompted by the Morgan case , the House of Representatives last week passed a bill to limit civil contempt-of-court sentences to twelve months . Based on the idea that a longer sentence turns coercion into punishment without due process , the bill now awaits action by the Senate .
