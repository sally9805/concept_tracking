It was enough to shock even Salvadorans , who are inured to almost daily reports of disappearances and murder . During the midday television news , a home videotape flickered across the screen . Seated in front of a purple-and-white Salvadoran flag , three men nervously confessed to past membership in the Salvadoran Communist Party . That very morning , said the news announcer , the right-wing group that sent the tape had condemned the three men to death on a charge of " high treason . " The terrorists then strangled the men and a female doctor , and afterward dumped the bodies in a San Salvador parking lot . <P> The killings , and the brazen release of the videotape , were the most dramatic evidence yet of a grisly new public relations campaign being staged by El Salvador 's infamous " death squads . " The right-wing terrorist groups have plagued the country since the beginning of El Salvador 's guerrilla war in 1979 . The recent attacks , how ever , have been aimed at influential targets , such as student leaders , professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Human rights activists and Western diplomats believe that many of the death squads are led by officers in the Salvadoran army and security forces . The recent upsurge in their activity appears to reflect the mounting frustrations of the ultraright , which has seen its power gradually erode over the past year . The right failed to gain control of key ministries after the March 1982 elections , and it has also been unable to derail the government 's programs to redistribute land more equitably . Making matters worse , in the right 's view , the Salvadoran Peace Commission , sponsored by the interim administration of President Alvaro Magana , has begun a " dialogue " with representatives of leftist guerrillas . <P> The right has also had trouble getting organized for next spring 's presidential elections . Says former President Jose Napoleon Duarte , a Christian Democrat who is now the front-running contender : " The death squads want to stop the reforms . They want to stop the democratic process . And they want to stop the Christian Democrats from coming to power . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
