Traversing the dusty , palm-fringed terrain of Angola ' s Mocamedes province , they moved into the desolate bush country with a grim determination. // And during one day and part of another , they pounded away at a black nationalist guerrilla encampment they had dubbed , with gruesome accuracy , " Smokeshell. " // When the smoke had cleared , reported 200 members of the South-West Africa People ' s Organization ( SWAPO ) and 16 brown-suited soldiers of the South African Army lay dead. // Last week ' s on a SWAPO base in southern Angola by South African troops marked a grim escalation in a somehwat obscure , but nonetheless brutal , war here in the southwestern corner of Africa. // In the balance is the future of nearly 1 million people who live in the dispute territory of Namibia ( formerly known as South-West Africa ) as well as control of untold millions of dollars worth of diamonds , uranium , and other valuable minerals. // Namibia is a moonscape of desolate mountains , towering sand dunes , and vast deserts teeming with wildlife. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment that German colonists ventured in 1884 and almost immediately began encroaching on farmlands of the indigenous black African people. // In the early 1900s , for example , a German effort to " exterminate " the Herero people  --  one of Namibia ' s diverse tribes  --  claimed the lives of some 65 , 000 people. // Germany ' s reign ended when South Africa invaded the territory in 1914 , during World War I. And that set the stage for Namibia ' s modern-day travail. // South Africa was given a mandate over the territory by the League on Nations in 1920 . That gave it effective control of an 823 , 000-square-mile expanse underlaid with vast amounts of uranium , copper , diamonds , gemstones , and other minerals . ( In 1973 , the last year for which figures are available , the total value of mineral exports was estimated at some $260 million. ) // Over the next 58 years , South Africa tried to annex Namibia , imposed a system of apartheid ( racial segregation ) on it , and eventually challenged the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , to reclaim jurisdiction over the territory and lead it to independence. // Protracted legal wrangling and negotiations , including two World Court cases , failed to shake South Africa ' s hold on Namibia . In the meantime , SWAPO was formed in 1966 as a vehicle for black African resistance to white-ruled South Africa ' s occupation. // SWAPO started out using peaceful means of protest , but its leadership was ruthlessly tormented , brutalized , and jailed by the South African government . In 1966 , SWAPO turned to an armed struggle for independence. // The South African Parliament even passed the broadly drawn Terrorism Act , which places the burden of proof on the accused , to convict jail some 34 SWAPO members in 1968. // One of them , a lay preacher named Toivo Herman ja toivo , said at his trial that even though " I believe that violence is a sin against God and my fellow men , " South African intransigence gave SWAPO no other alternative. // In 1976 , according to some former SWAPO members , the leadership of the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideologically closer to their Russian , Cuban , and East German arms suppliers . SWAPO eventually broadened its aims for Namibia to include not only independence , but also institution of " scientific socialism "  --  which many take to mean a Marxist government  --  in the new state. // South Africa abhors the thought of a Marxist regime on its western border , and is deeply suspicious of the United Nations . But faced with the threat of Namibian issue , South Africa agreed in April 1978 to allow UN-supervised elections for a constituent assembly that would fashion an independence constitution for the territory. // Varying interpretations over details of the plan have led to continual delays , however. the upshot : Namibia today remains the last patch of Africa that is not independent. // There are , of course , conflicting claims over just who is to blame . South Africa ' s critics say it is stalling , in hopes it can somehow prevent SWAPO from coming to power . South Africa , in turn , asks how the UN can supervise " free and fair " elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa is well aware that it was the relatively powerless UN General Assembly that endorsed SWAPO ' s claims to the territory , and that it is the more potent UN Security Council that would actually supervise elections . But this is brushed off by pretoria as a mere legal distinction that does little to prove the neutrality of the Security Council or the UN personnel that would supervise the proposed seven-month transition to independence. // As the stalemate continues , so do the guerrilla clashes here on Namibia ' s northern border. // Most of the fighting is centered in the north-central part of the country , ancestral home of the Ovambo tribes , for two reasons. // One is that Ovamboland , with its low scrub vegetation and wiry trees , is one of the few areas in this arid territory with sufficient vegetation to provide cover for bush warfare . Another is that fully 46 percent of the Namibian population lives in the area  --  a decisive voting bloc in an election. // It is no wonder then that South Africa has spent untold millions over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at other bases along Namibia ' s 950-mile-long border . It is from the Ovambo people , too , that SWAPO draws the majority of the recruits for its guerrilla campaign. // Infiltrating from neighboring Angola and Zambia , SWAPO is clearly causing havoc in the northern reaches of the territory . Roads have been mined as far as 60 miles into the interior , and in some areas traffic is forced to travel in convoys. // Wearing olive-green Chinese " tiger suits " and carrying sundry East-bloc weapons , SWAPO guerrillas mingle with the Ovambo tribespeople , spreading their political doctrine  --  and dealing ruthlessly with anyone they regards as a " sellout. " // Johnny Makoka , a former SWAPO political commissar captured by the South Africans , says he went from village to village with the news that " SWAPO is going to come here and liberate the country , " and that " after the country has been liberated , the people will get work , and they will get education. " // Mr. Makoka says most people were receptive to that message. // The South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack the support of the people . But a high-ranking South African military man says frankly , " We must have a political settlement here , because neither side can win a military victory. " // But just when the United Nations plan for UN-supervised elections will come to fruition is anybody ' s guess . In the meantime , South Africa is pressing ahead with its own plans for a limited form of self-goverment for the territory . Its hope , apparently , is that the leaders of the internal government might gain credibility and provide an alternative to SWAPO when  --  and if  --  elections take place. // The showpiece of this internal government is the National Assembly , a legislative body with powers that are more apparent than real . It meets in the capital city of Windhoek , in a converted high school gymnasium ( a " Turnhalle " in German ) . // The setting is that of a parliament-in-miniature , with representatives of various Namibian ethnic groups debating while eight interpreters in glass booths provide translations. // Undeniably , Namibia is an ethnic agglomeration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomadic desert Bushmen to white Afrikaners , as well as a number of black tribal groups that speak different languages. // But it is the stress on ethnicity that has brought much critcism to South Africa ' s administration of the territory . It formerly tried to institute a policy of tribal reserves ( known as " homelands " ) here . Moreover , under South African tutelage , a number of blatantly discriminatory measures were introduced in Namibia , measures that are only now being repealed. // Even now , much legislative authority in the territory does not actually lie with the National Assembly , but with a series of ethnically based regional governments . Until late May , the white government administered the entire country ' s educational system . Today , it still retains the power to prevent racial integration of white schools and , by controlling the amount of low-income housing in white areas , block residential integration. // But the ultimate power in Namibia is held by the administrator-general , an official appointed by the South African government . The current administrator general , Dr. Gerrit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret society of Afrikaners in white-ruled * South Africa. // Despite this , Dr. Viljoen is known as a moderate in the ruling National Party , a pragmatist who recognizes that South Africa can not hang on to the disputed territory indefinitely. // Nevertheless , he says that " if there is further delay " in UN-supervised elections , " there are certain areas where internal constitutional development could take place . " And he frankly admits that he hopes to " enhance the image " of internal parties by giving them more power in the territory , in hopes they will develop into credible opponents of SWAPO. // By some counts , there are 39 separate political parties in Namibia , most of them based along tribal or ethnic lines . A number of these have grouped together to form the Democratic turnhalle alliance ( DTA ) , which has a majority in the National Assembly. // The head of the DTA is a white man , a burly farmer named Dirk Mudge , who says that DTA is " opposed to domination , discrimination , and racial prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxism , he says , adding , " We don ' t want a SWAPO government in this country . . . . We want to make it as difficult as possible for them to win an election. " // But Mr. Judge complains that the DTA is hobbled by a lack of real governmental authority in the National Assembly , and by a truculent white ethnic government controlled by the right-wing AKTUR party ( Action Front for the Retention of Turnhalle Principles ) . // AKTUR chairman Abraham H. Duplessis , a former Cabinet minister in the South African government , says frankly , " We don ' t believe in majority rule  --  plain and simple majority rule. " // " We are against the opening up of residential areas , " he adds , as well as the compulsory integration of hotels , restaurants , and schools. // But the limited voluntary efforts to end discrimination here lack credibility in many circles . Although all public facilities in Namibia have been desegregated , a number of private establishments remain for " whites only. " // During a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black representative complained that an AKTUR party member prevented him from sitting on a bench at a service station while waiting for his car to be refueled . Such incidents , he said , contribute to the view among blacks that " nothing has changed " under the National Assembly , and ultimately add to the support for SWAPO. // But moves to give the internal parties more power only fuel suspicion that South Africa has a " unilateral declaration of independence UDI " in mind for Namibia  --  the same kind of UDI that propelled neighboring Zimbabwe ( formerly Rhodesia ) into a bitter , 14-year-long civil war. // Slowly , the South African government is taking steps that some analysts refer to as " creeping UDI . " One is creation of a South-West African defense force , analogous to a national army . Another is creation of council with ministerial powers , drawn from the National Assembly , analogous to a parliamentary Cabinet . Mr. Mudge has emerged as head of the ministerial council. // South African government spokesmen deny they have any plans for independence for Namibia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if South Africa were forced to choose between international recognition for an independent Namibia and internal stability in the territory , it would choose the latter. // Sam Nujoma , president of SWAPO , argues that South Africa is employing delaying tactics. // " Racist South Africa , with the backing of international imperialism , is able to defy world opinion , " he says. // Calling on Western nations to support mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa , Mr. Nujoma adds , " We believe that only through such actions will South Africa be forced to a negotiated settlement . . . . Otherwise we will have no alternative but an intensification of the armed struggle. " // " Sam Nujoma is like a tape recording , " complains Andreas Shipanga , one of a number of politicians inside Namibia who oppose both South Africa ' s continued occupation of the territory and SWAPO ' s plans for it after independence. // Another is Reinhard Rukaro , a spokesman for the Namibia National Front ( NNF ) , a coalition of left-leaning and centrist parties. // " The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was to delay as long as possible , " he says. // But he is equally critical of SWAPO , accusing the organization of conducting a " campaign of terror " in Namibia . Under a SWAPO government , he says , Namibia is " in for a dictatorship , a one-party state at best. " // Echoing that view is Mr. Shipanga , leader of a group of former SWAPO members who call themselves " SWAPO-Democrats . " Mr. Shipanga says SWAPO president Nujoma has fallen under the influence of Russian , Cuban , and East German advisers who have turned the organization into a Marxist mouthpiece. // " I will never go on record as saying Sam Nujoma is a communist , " says Mr. Shipanga , " because he ' s got no capacity to understand ' Das Kapital. ' " // SWAPO might lose an election if one were held soon , says Mr. Shipanga . But he accuses South Africa of employing " delaying tactics " that are only aiding the SWAPO cause. // " If things are left to drift , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he warns. // A number of independent observers suggest that SWAPO probably already enjoys majority support in the territory , and that its backing only increases as the war drags on. // And drag on its does , although lately at a spiralling level of violence. // It is difficult to piece together a complete picture of the military conflict in the area. // One complicating factor : guerrillas of Jonas Savimbi ' s UNITA ( Union for the Total Independence of Angola ) are active in southern Angola , apparently getting support from South Africa in their harassment of both SWAPO and Angolan government troops. // In addition , SWAPO allows few Western journalists to view the battle from its side of the lines. // And the South African government allows only prearranged visits to the war zone for journalists , in which it selects the military and civilian speakers in briefings. // Even then , the government is evasive . One recent group of foeign journalists was repeatedly assured by military commanders that SWAPO simply did not have any bases in the Angola border region  --  less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on the Smokeshell base , said to have been spread over a 40-square-mile area. // Similarly , casualty figures need to be viewed with a critical eye . The South African government , for example , boasts of a " mill rate "  --  a macabre term for the ratio of SWAPO deaths for each South African trooper lost  --  of around 30 to 1 . In fact , published figures since the beginning of 1980 suggest that the rate is closer to 10 to 1. // One thing is indisputable : Recent months have seen a clear escalation in hostilities . The South African government concedes that the conflict is spreading from Ovamboland into previously peaceful areas to the west and confirms that mine-laying incidents are on the increase. // To increase its military manpower , the South African government recently has formed a South-West African defense force  --  drawn from inside the territory  --  to augment the South African military units on the border . One military spokesman explains , with somewhat tortuous logic , that response to the new fighting force has been so gret among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented shortly. // The nucleus of this new force is being trained at a former teachers ' college near Okahandja . The eventual goal is to have seven battalions  --  most ethnically bsed  --  of 900 to 1 , 000 men each , to pit against the estimated 6 , 000 to 8 , 000 SWAPO cadres. // But the entire population of Namibia is estimated at only about 974 , 000  --  a figure probably too small to provide sufficient young men to replace the South African troops currently on the border. // Consequently , the South African Army might well remain in the territory indefinitely. // And how do the South African soldiers  --  most of whom are conscripts  --  feel about that ? // One husky soldier says , " We don ' t mind at all . Because this is the front line . If the communists take over here , they ' ll be after our country next. " // Just the same , the South African government is investigating claims that some Army officers were bribed to make sure some solders were not posted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that they can not hope to hold their own in the conflict without the support of the local populace , who can offer food and shelter to guerrillas , and alert them of troops movements . Consequently , the Army tries to curry favor with the Ovambo people by , for example , providing soldiers to staff local schools and clinics. // Nevertheless , the combat area is under a dusk-to-dawn curfew , and local residents have been moved out of a one-kilometer-wide strip along the Angolan border where South African soldiers have orders to " shoot to kill. " // GEn. Jannie Geldenhuys , the South African Army commander in Namibia , says , " I feel we are doing very well " in the military conflict , but adds , " I am not going to comment on whether anyone is winning the hearts and minds of the Ovambo people , because I regard that as a job for the politicians. " // Mr. Rukaro of the NNF has his own answer . " They have been trying to win the hearts and minds of the people since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , they have failed. " // One telltale indicator : the lack of success of a government-backed housing project here in Oshakati . The government has built 350 homes  --  at a cost of $32 , 000-$38 , 000 each  --  and offered them for sale or rental at only $10. 00 monthly . Thus far , only about 200 people have applied for the neat , well-constructed homes. // A white official suggests that word of the availability of the houses has not gotten around yet , even though he admits that the government has " gone out of our way " to publicize the housing development. // But there are other possible explanations . One is that the internal government is building unneeded houses  --  and is out of step with local needs . For a government struggling to gain credibility , that is an indictment of its political prowess. // Another explanation is that SWAPO has spread the word that anyone moving into the houses will be viewed as a " sellout "  --  and dealt with accordingly . And that is an indictment of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Oshakati stand empty  --  and curiously out of place  --  on the sandy stretches here in northern Namibia . Soldiers routinely pass near them as they begin nights of patrolling , laying ambushes , and scouting an evasive enemy. // How much longer will those figures in olive brown be fighting a war in Namibia ? Moreover , who will eventually win the political struggle for the territory ? // Dr. Viljoen , while admitting that " time , according to the textbooks , is on th e side of the insurgents , " says that another nine months to a year of " effective action " by the internal government would enhance its chances of winning an eventual election. // But no one knows whether an election will be held even then. // " It seems like this process is going on ad infinitum . And in the meantime , our people are suffering , " says DTA vice-chairman Dr. Benjamin Africa. // And Mr. Shipanga warns , " If there is no solution soon , this country is headed for disaster . We don ' t have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more lives are being lost. " // //
