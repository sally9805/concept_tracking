*Singers who had the high notes were allowed to interpolate , i. e. , add a harmonically complementary higher note to the one in the score. // *Repeat verses of arias were eliminated , as were some incidental moments throughout the score - a musical process known as cutting. // *And the raw , energy of the musical lines in these sometimes elemental but always stirring works was never allowed to lapse. // These days a new breed of conductor is in charge of opera , one that frowns on interpolations , even when they clearly enhance the dramatic thrust , one that restores or ' ' opens up ' ' all the cuts , even when the music is poor or when the momentum of an act or scene will be impaired. // // These conductors also favor a dogged fidelity to the printed score over the spirit and intention of the composer - as if merely getting the notes out with the appropriate ( and rigid ) attention to dynamics , accents , and tempo was the only thing necessary to bring any opera score to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital work . For instance , in the EMI/Angel recording of ' ' Ernani ' ' ( just recently transferred to three CDs , set number CDCC 47082 ) , conductor Riccardo Muti crosses all the ' ' t ' s , ' ' dots all the ' ' i ' s , ' ' opens all the cuts , bans all interpolations , and turns a fun opera into a dull one . On a practical level , with all those cuts opened , the role of Elvira becomes a marathon of high ' ' B ' s ' ' and ' ' C ' s. ' ' // There is an insistent energy to Mr. Muti ' s brusque reading , but the performance is wanting in majesty and dramatic insight . Placido Domingo lacks the heroic ringing top notes to bring the impassioned title role to life ; Renato Bruson has never had the top notes , the robustness of voice , or dynamic musical personality to do justice to the role of Don Carlo ; Nicolai Ghiaurov , the Silva , sounds tired and frayed of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another recent conversion to CD is the Philips recording of ' ' Attila ' ' ( 412 875-2 , two CDs ) , a 14-year-old performance with Ruggero Raimondi in the title role . This was part of an early-Verdi cycle conducted by Lamberto Gardelli , whose tepid , listless conducting throughout seemed to indicate he had forgotten that these inflammatory operas incited riots in the theaters . Here , Mr. Raimondi creates a vivid character ; Sherrill Milnes sings a good robust Ezio ; and Dutch soprano Cristina Deutekom was cast because Philips is a Dutch company . The set ' s real merit is Carlo Bergonzi ' s magnificent Foresto . The transfers to CD only enhance what was a sonically handsome set . <> <> ' Rigoletto ' on DG , Philips , and London // Nowhere are the differences in performance style as pronounced as in ' ' Rigoletto , ' ' three recordings of which are now available on CD . The work is a supreme singer ' s piece and a major piece of drama as well . To deny the singers their full glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into mere vocal exhibition saps it of dramatic richness. // For me , the best stereo ' ' Rigoletto ' ' is conducted by the veteran Italian maestro Carlo Maria Giulini , now superbly transferred to two CDs ( Deutsche Grammophon 415 288-2 ) . He finds a dark , Shakespearean quality to the work , and the Vienna Philharmonic gives him all the burnished colors and searingly intense playing he demands . He has opened all the cuts and has also allowed his singers several of the traditional interpolations , because he knows those notes enhance the drama of the moment when effectively done . Nevertheless , in other places , he eschews those traditions , thereby tightening the thrust of the musical action . Throughout there is the sense of a major musical exploration that reveals Verdi ' s innermost meanings. // Piero Cappuccilli ' s eloquently sung Jester is a thing of great constrasts - hate , love , tenderness , cruelty . The Duke is Placido Domingo in one of his better recorded performances in opera . Ileana Cotrubas is a true lyric-soprano Gilda , affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to her sacrifice her life to save the caddish Duke . Nicolai Ghiaurov ' s Sparafucile is especially menacing , and Kurt Moll ' s Monterone and Elena Obraztsova ' s Maddalena are lavish casting turns indeed. // A quick listen to the last act of conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli ' s new recording ( Philips digital two CDs , 412 592-2 ) will tell the listener all he or she needs to know : Sinopoli imposes aribtrary tempos and abrupt changes , and refuses all interpolated notes . In a word , he feels that sticking to most of the recent findings printed in the new critical edition of the score ( though this recording is not listed as being of that edition ) is enough to bring the work to life . Unlike Muti , Mr. Sinopoli occasionally gives his singers room to expand into a long arching phrase , and he does allow singers moments of sheer vocal splendor , albeit without interpolations. // Renato Bruson has always lacked the quality high notes a ' ' traditional ' ' Rigoletto demanded . Here he is allowed to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but dramatically and vocally lightweight Jester. // Neil Shicoff ' s Duke does not capture his distinctive tenor voice in peak form . Brigitte Fassbaender is an adequate Maddalena , and Robert Lloyd a sonorous Sparafucile. // Finally , the Gilda , Edita Gruberova , is a mistress of the stratosphere denied her soaring moments of glory . She makes her mark nonetheless in her vivid portrayal. // On the handsomely engineered London ' ' Rigoletto ' ' ( two analog CDs , 414 269-2 ) , Joan Sutherland is the full-voiced Gilda with a dramatic coloratura that has the extension for the interpolations she inserts , as well as the vocal size to ride the considerable climaxes of several scenes . Though she gives a dramatically cool performance , her gloriously sung Gilda is one of the principal reasons for owning the set. // The other reason is Luciano Pavarotti ' s dashing Duke ; he and Miss Sutherland work particularly well together . Martti Talvela is the earnest Sparafucile . Sherrill Milnes has his share of rough moments in the title role , and conductor Richard Bonynge is content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Ironically , this vocally impressive ' ' Rigoletto ' ' proves that just singing the opera well is not enough to bring forth all its dramatic possibilities. // //
