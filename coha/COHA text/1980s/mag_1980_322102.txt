The Presidency <P> A few days before the election , Cartoonist Garry Trudeau extracted from his vivid imagination a huge cross section of Ronald Reagan 's brain , in which he placed the intrepid television reporter Roland Hedley Jr . With microphone and camera , Hedley Jr . searched for behavioral patterns in the cortex and the cerebellum with its maze of neurons and their dendritic spines . <P> Some editors detected a certain prejudice against Reagan , and they threw the cartoon out or put it on the editorial page . Trudeau was guilty as charged , a practitioner of marvelous bias and political deviltry . But any serious student of why Presidents say what they say and do what they do knows that Trudeau , who comes from a family of physicians , had his observer in the right place pondering the ingredients of leadership . <P> Our system , of course , is designed with its web of checks and balances , and open scrutiny that can halt a good deal of presidential caprice and anger , and prevent excess and foolishness . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is so important that we have piled up more power in the Oval Office than those who designed the system ever imagined . That power is unleashed by the sequence of events inside the very individualistic mind of the President-any President . So it will be with Ronald Reagan . <P> Many wonder if we poke and prod too much at Presidents , speculating on their moods , their IQs , grasp of history , courage and honor . That may be so , but the search is not likely to cease . Too much rides on the man 's conclusions for it to be otherwise . Yet at the same time we must recognize the discomforting fact that the analysis of presidential intelligence and wisdom remains a difficult and error-ridden public sport . <P> Franklin Roosevelt was hardly envisioned as the midwife to social revolution nor was Harry Truman suspected of being the resolute student of history he turned out to be . Lyndon Johnson , the most brilliant legislator we have ever had in the White House , flopped when he tried to apply the techniques of compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts than his predecessors about the problems that came to him , could not put them together in a way that gave direction to his presidency . <P> What all this proves is that we can make a pretty good judgment about the individual qualities of a man before he gets to the White House , but we can not confidently predict how these characteristics will finally interact within the presidential context . <P> On a Friday night in April 1961 , John Kennedy gathered a handful of his close advisers in the Cabinet Room and pondered what to do about the Soviets ' space challenge . Only two days before , Yuri Gagarin had become the first man to go into orbit . Kennedy was 43 then and seemed 30 , a man of little scientific knowledge who listened to his technicians describe a ten-year , $40 billion race with no guarantee that America would get to the moon first . Like a boy , Kennedy put his foot on the edge of the Cabinet table , fiddled with a loose rubber sole on his shoe , ran his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . Fifteen minutes later he sent the word out : " We are going to the moon . "
