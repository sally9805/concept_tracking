" While the photo is , in a funny way , arranged , it has a realness about it , " Ms. MacGraw said . It is , however , as far removed from traditional portrait photography as are jeans from party dresses and starched wing collars. // Since the camera was invented 150 years ago , families have been portrayed in stiff , symmetrical groups that spelled out roles and hierarchy . Today family portraits are far more likely to follow flights of fancy , whether of the photographer or the subject . This change owes much to technological advances that enable both photographer and subject to move about freely and pose with lighthearted informality . Rigid posture and glazed eyes have given way to cartwheels , sudden grins and in-flight moments. // But there is more to this change than mere technology . It is also closely aligned with the wider social revolution : a new freedom to express one ' s self , the radical changes in family relations and groupings , a society that no longer demands that , at all costs , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , photographers have explored the full range of children ' s personalities , allowing them to express silliness , radiance , pensiveness or seriousness . Today , a child can be photographed hanging from a tree , her belly button exposed between T-shirt and jeans , near naked on a beach , or posed as a fairy-tale princess in a studio. // " The early portraits looked formal because the children had to sit still , " said Mimi Vang Olsen , a Manhattan artist whose father , Kirk Hovsepian , was a studio photographer on Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx from 1927 until 1980 . He used an 8- by-10-inch view camera , affixed to a tripod. // " The child would be very self-conscious , " Mrs. Vang Olsen continued . " She ' d be sitting on a bench , with two lights on either side , and the parents would be saying , ' Fix your knickers , pull up your sock , put the bow in your hair . You can ' t move . ' Everything had to be perfect. " // Today , portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the client wants to make it . For sheer , cheap fun , there is the photo machine , where you sit inside the booth , draw the curtain shut , choose a pose and get four images for a dollar . Most of these machines produce color photos but , for the purist , there are still a few black-and-white booths around . Oneof these , at Little Rickie , a novelty store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , draws the downtown art crowd and their children. // " People use it as daily , weekly or monthly documentation , " said Phillip Retzsky , who with Mitchell Cantor owns the store . " They like the immediacy of the photography , that they get a picture in two and a half minutes , and have control of the image because the pose is reflected on the glass booth. " // Sophie Adams is 9 months old . Since she was born , her mother , Elyse , a former buyer at Unique Clothing Warehouse in Manhattan , has brought her every month to Little Rickie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your baby naked and turn her upside down , if that ' s the picture you want , " Mrs. Adams said . She frames her child ' s portraits with Popsicle sticks , or makes Christmas tree ornaments using Sophie ' s picture and that of the baby from a Gerber baby-food box. // In a more serious vein , Joel Meyerowitz , a 51-year-old Manhattan photographer whose work is in the permanent collections of , among other places , the Museum of Modern Art and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts , tries to capture the truth of a person in a single moment . To that end , he makes only one photograph of his subjects , waiting for the extraordinary moment to reveal itself . He does not try to make his subjects look pretty. // " I say , ' Make yourself comfortable , ' " he said . " I wait until they ' re comfortable , and then I make a shapely image . They must look into the camera and when they do , something happens and they come to rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re looking in the mirror , when you look into your own eyes. " // In his portrait of David Bee , " Joel captured the seriousness in his eyes , the sensitivity of a 9-year-old , " said David ' s mother , Harriet , who is managing editor of the publications department of the Museum of Modern Art . When Mrs. Bee saw the larger-than-life-size portrait , she said , she was so moved she cried. // Photographers like Penny Millar , who is based in London but frequently travels to the United States , and Patricia Nolan , who works in Manhattan , use small cameras so they can move freely and capture a child ' s evanescent moods . Ms. Millar , who works with a 105-millimeter portrait lens , which produces a clear face and a blurry background , works only outdoors in natural light . She gets the children to hang from trees or curl up on rocks. // " It is better than putting them in the living room , " she said . " It takes the edge off the situation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between , the change of mood - the different angles , the eyelashes in the sun , the hairs on the back of the neck - the essence of the child. " // To elicit spontaneity , she prefers to photograph a child alone , rather than with parents or siblings . " A child relaxes when he ' s alone because attention is being paid to him , " Ms. Millar said . " If you take a picture of more than one person at a time , people sometimes lose their personalities because it ' s very hard to capture two or three individuals all doing something different. " // Ms. Nolan , whose technique is similar to Ms. Millar ' s , photographed the designs of the fashion designer Betsey Johnson for 11 years . During this time , she also made hundreds of children ' s portraits . Using a 35-millimeter camera , Ms. Nolan likes to spend two to three hours with a child , although the photography may take only 20 minutes. // She invites children to her home in Columbia County , N.Y. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a salad , which they eat outdoors . " The best picture is when you have a real rapport , not just a professional rapport , " she said. // In Manhattan , where she has a loft , she also works only with natural light . She and Ms. Millar will also handpaint the photographs to give them a painterly quality. // For people who want a taste of the old formality , Emily Simson , a 31-year-old photographer in Manhattan , specializes in carefully posed , glamorous studio photography . But this is formality with a difference . Ms. Simson asks parents and children to create a romantic fantasy as the setting for the portrait. // A child can wear a Victorian dress or a hat with Mickey Mouse ears . She can sit on a rocking horse or a tiny wicker chair , and Ms. Simson will style the portrait with props , including porcelain dolls , flowers or marble balls .

She paints the picture with one layer of paint , and waits an hour for it to seep into the grain of the paper and to dry . Then she adds other colors. // " I shoot in black and white , which is real , " she said , " and then I can paint and make it unreal , and more personal. " // When making her portrait of Ali MacGraw and Joshua Evans , Ms. Demchick painted the walls in the black-and-white photo blue and cream . On the left side of the picture , Ms. MacGraw ' s tights are black and her son ' s jeans are blue , but in a reflection in a mirror to the right , Joshua ' s jeans are brown . The picture is slightly hallucinatory. // But even in this era of change and variety , the ordinary , old-fashioned studio portrait is still very much alive .

In the 1940 ' s , a typical photo session took 30 minutes , Mrs. Vang Olsen noted ; in 1989 at Kinder Foto , it takes about five. // On a recent Sunday , Ms. Whitten was photographing 13-month-old Tommy Paulic from Lodi , N.J. He sat on a chair , which rested on a table . His mother stood nearby to make sure he didn ' t fall , while Ms. Whitten cooed : " Tommy . Hi , sweetheart . Hi , hi . " Tommy looked radiant. // All these photos may fade over the years .

Newly cut hair has a raw look that is unflattering. // Dress your child appropriately for the situation . If the photo session is in a park , patent-leather slippers and a party dress will look all wrong . But for a formal portrait , fancy clothes are just the ticket . Let the photographer establish his own rapport with the child . If a child is to be photographed alone , some photographers prefer to be left tete-a-tete with their subject . " Parents have their own vision of what they think is the perfect smile of their child , " said Penny Millar , a London-based photographer .
