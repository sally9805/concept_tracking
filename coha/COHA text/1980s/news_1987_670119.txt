WARSAW , Poland  --  They ' ve completely renovated Restauracja Szanghaj , the premier Chinese restaurant of Poland . Workers lacquered the dining room black and rolled a red carpet down the broad staircase . Now it ' s opening day , and Poles crowd in to sit under tasseled lanterns and fork down jellied-eel salad , horse meat with moon mushrooms and three-taste turkey , all accompanied by steamed rice and rye bread . Kleig lights flood the scene , and a camera crew records it . " The place had to be renewed , " says Bogunika Kurdus , the manager . She stands in front of the fish tank in a white coat . " It opened in 1957 , but after that we had problems . Now , with China , things are better . You can see our relations in the menu . We ' ve got noodles , moon mushrooms , sesame oil . We would like to have everything we had 30 years ago . Plus chili paste . " In a town where people still think of soy sauce as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet Polish-Chinese relations have taken such a turn of late that diplomats here talk of a Polish restaurant opening in Peking . The prospect of the Chinese dining out on kilbasa grew bright in September , when Poland ' s leader , Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski , set out on a trip to North Korea and Mongolia , and showed up in the communist world ' s foremost forbidden city . " All roads lead to Peking , " he said as he shook hands with China ' s chief , Deng Xiaoping , in the Great Hall of the People . " So here I am . " It was the first courtesy call on China in more than two decades by a viceroy of the Soviet sphere . Erich Honecker , the top East German , quickly followed the general , and Janos Kadar of Hungary will likely pay tribute next . The Czechs and Bulgarians could go , too . " We are genuinely satisfied to watch the process of China ' s relations with other socialist countries improving and expanding , " Gen. Jaruzelski said after a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how to handle chopsticks . Then the general took off for home  --  and touched down briefly in Moscow to regale Mikhail Gorbachev with tales of the orient . Unlike some of his earlier Soviet sojourns , this one was made public . Nobody pretended that a meeting of East and East could have taken place without a permit issued in the U.S.S.R. Nor could a Soviet-dubbed leader let China disrupt his country ' s " brotherly alliance with our great neighbor , " as Gen. Jaruzelski puts it . With the Soviets themselves trying to get a foot in China ' s door , the Eastern Europeans look like Gorbachev advance men . But there is a bit more to it . Though the Chinese have warmed to the Russians , they still have complaints . They don ' t like Russia ' s troops on their border , or its troops in Afghanistan , or the troops of Moscow ' s Vietnamese clients occupying Cambodia . By contrast , the Chinese don ' t have a whole lot against Russia ' s brotherly allies in Europe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Not with us . " By doing a little advance work , the Eastern Europeans have gained a rare chance to practice some homemade diplomacy . Especially for Poland , this has real value . Not since the martial law hammer came down in 1981 has a country outside the Warsaw Pact paid it so much respect . Not until now has Poland had a non-allied trading partner that didn ' t demand to be paid in hard-to-find hard currency . China , meantime , has a chance to do some playful poaching in the Soviet back-40 . What ' s more , barter trade with Eastern Europe saves money and gives China ' s economy a non-Western leg to stand on . " Our technology has advantages over Western technology , " says a Polish journalist who follows China . " It ' s not so advanced . It doesn ' t save too much labor . " Easing back into touch with China , it appears , will be next to painless for Eastern Europe . These countries never did participate fully in the Sino-Soviet slanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line all through the Chinese Cultural Revolution  --  and the cultural revolution , Polish-style , of the early 1980s . China began its Polish rapprochement soon after Gen. Jaruzelski declared martial law : it quit publishing the pronouncements of the outlawed union , Solidarity . During Erich Honecker ' s visit , with a flourish of diplomatic obfuscation , it amended its policy favoring German reunification ; now it favors unity only as long as that doesn ' t disturb the distinct identity of the East Germans . As fellow reformers , the Chinese have lots of free-market tips to exchange with the Hungarians . They have gone so far as to show interest in Poland ' s reforms , if only to learn what not to do . A Polish report on Gen. Jaruzelski ' s talk with Deng Xiaoping said the Chinese reformer stressed the need to avoid " major mistakes . " Chinese-Polish trade has already leaped , to $1 billion in 1986 from $281 million in 1984 . Chinese saucepans and long underwear cram Polish stores . The Poles are set to sell China a coal-washing plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broken down factories they built there in the 1950s . A Polish official talks of passing China some fancy technology bought in the profligate 1970s from the West . So many delegations have been whizzing between Warsaw and Peking since the general ' s trip that the Poles can ' t find enough translators . A Chinese feature film has just had its Polish premiere . A ping-pong team is due . New members sign up at the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association at the rate of 10 a week . " I just saw a TV program , " says a young man filling in his application there one day . " It ' s a wonderful country . " For this Pole and many others , China has begun its journey back from obscurity , much as it did for the West Europeans and Americans more than a decade ago . Before long , Restauracja Szanghaj may well collect its shipment of chili paste . All it will need after that is a Chinese cook .
