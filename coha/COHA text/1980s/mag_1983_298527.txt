The presidential commission is a peculiar creature of political expediency , at times the refuge of a timid and hesitant Chief Executive . The libraries of America groan with tomes from such advisory groups pronouncing on the great issues of the day . They have ranged in purpose from Lyndon Johnson 's Atlantic-Pacific Interoceanic Canal Study Commission ( a six-year , seven-volume study for an alternative to the Panama Canal ) to Dwight Eisenhower 's Commission on Presidential Office Space ( seven months and 40 pages of mind-dulling prose ) . The truth is that most of those reports are unread or unheeded or both . And in some cases , such as the 1970 recommendations of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography , they are denounced by both Congress and the White House , the very folks who asked for help . <P> So it is fairly remarkable that within three months two presidential commissions have delivered policy conclusions that have had sweeping impact . The recommendations by the Commission on Social Security Reform are now largely law , saving the system from bankruptcy . Those from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiwarhead MX , while shifting our long-term emphasis to smaller , single-warhead missiles . <P> Since a presidential commission usually signals a failure of the normal governmental machinery , Chief Executives have been wary of appointing too many of them . But the new successes have made the White House wonder whether we should have blue-ribbon panels assigned to two of the biggest problems we face : the budgetary chaos that is producing huge deficits and the lack of a coordinated defense plan . <P> Alan Greenspan , who headed the Social Security commission , points out that Congress is ill suited to take away either the wealth or benefits it has granted . " Our commission , " says Greenspan , " gave both Congress and the White House political protection . " While pleasing no one , it spread the sacrifice equally . The commission met in an atmosphere of crisis because the Social Security fund was practically broke . An answer was needed , and a deadline had to be met . " I saw demagogues forced to be statesmen , " chuckles Greenspan . <P> The sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature of the commission members . Placed in a room with fellow overachievers , all worked to the peak of their abilities . Lane Kirkland , president of the AFL-CIO , was not about to be compared unfavorably with Alexander Trowbridge , president of the National Association of Manufacturers . A kind of magic set in , relates Greenspan . For a heady time , the national interest transcended all other considerations . The commission worked out the problem , and the White House and Congress were so overjoyed at avoiding political blame that they accepted changes in benefits and taxes that had earlier made them balk.
