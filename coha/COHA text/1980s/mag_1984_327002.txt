A scholarly panel calls for a return of culture to the curriculum <P> The purpose of a college education was once to enlarge and illuminate one 's life , " declared William J. Bennett , chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities , last week . But according to a toughly worded N.E.H. document just released over Bennett 's signature , that high purpose is all but abandoned . The study , titled To Reclaim a Legacy : A Report on the Humanities in Higher Education , offers persuasive evidence that the humanities " have lost their central place in the undergraduate curriculum . " At too many campuses , the report asserts , students are hustling through a " self-service cafeteria " of unrelated courses , not with the purpose of becoming illuminated but , says Bennett , " just to get a job . " <P> Among the N.E.H. findings , assembled by Bennett and a distinguished 31-member panel of scholars and other authorities on education : <P> &gt; " A student can obtain a bachelor 's degree from 75% of all American colleges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having studied American literature or history ; and from 86% without having studied the civilizations of classical Greece and Rome . " <P> &gt; " Fewer than half of all colleges and universities now require foreign language study for the bachelor 's degree , down from nearly 90% in 1966 . " <P> &gt; " Since 1970 the number of majors in English has declined by 57% , in philosophy by 41% , in history by 62% and in modern language by 50% . " <P> Furthermore , a large number of top professors are concentrating on narrow , specialized fields of learning , delegating the teaching of residual first-and second-year humanities courses to " underpaid flunkies , " e.g. , graduate students and part-time instructors . The overall consequence , claims the study , is that millions of students have been coming out of college " lacking even the most rudimentary knowledge , about the . . . foundations of their nation and their civilization . " <P> Bennett 's scathing report , coming only a month after a much broader critique by the National Institute of Education on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humanities ' low estate upon " those of us whose business it is to educate these students . " The academic concession to student pressures for so-called relevance or job-related courses is branded " a failure of nerve and faith on the part of many college faculties and administrators . " <P> The N.E.H. prescription for this deep malaise is a reshaping of " undergraduate curricula based on a clear vision of what constitutes an educated person . " The Bennett report makes plain its own vision : <P> the humanities restored as the centerpiece of a full four-year curriculum . Among the other recommendations : substantial course work on the evolution of Western civilization ; " a careful reading " of masterworks of English , American and European literature ; a sound grasp of the " most significant ideas and debates in the history of philosophy " ; " demonstrable proficiency in a foreign language .
