TIME Correspondent Marsh Clark , who originated the idea of a cover story that would survey Africa a quarter-century after independence , has worked in the southern part of that continent for three years . He is not one of journalism 's " old Africa hands , " but he thinks he knows the type well . They are , he explains , " the ones who have suffered Africa 's bureaucratic indignities , its frustrations and inefficiencies , and its occasional dangers , but who still believe that the continent 's shortcomings are far outweighed by its virtues : its heart-stopping beauty , its hospitable people , its primitiveness . " <P> For the preparation of this week 's story , which included reporting from the majority of countries in black Africa , Clark was able to work alongside five old Africa hands . Correspondent James Wilde , who covered Africa for TIME from the mid-1960s to 1971 , including the Biafra revolt in Nigeria , was back in that country last week to report on the sudden military coup . He got there , barely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Over Lagos , " says Wilde , " the harmattan , a dust-laden wind blowing from the Sahara , had reduced visibility to 500 yds . On our first try at landing , one wing nearly scraped the runway ; we began to stall . But our nerveless Ivorian pilot gunned the motor , and the plane lifted , shuddering . We made it on the second pass and emerged , wobbly with fear . " <P> Wilde recently took over the post of Nairobi bureau chief from John Borrell , a correspondent in Africa for twelve years , who joined TIME 15 months ago . Borrell visited half a dozen countries for the story , and even made his way to Timbuktu , the remote Malian walled city that for centuries has conjured up exotic images among non-Africans . <P> Peter Hawthorne has spent 29 years in Africa and has covered everything from Kenya 's Mau Mau rebellion in the 1950s to the violent transition of Rhodesia into Zimbabwe . With Nairobi Reporter Alastair Matheson and Capetown 's John Platter , the five have accumulated a total of 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main cover story was the work of Associate Editor Russ Hoyle , who has written often on African affairs . Senior Writer Bill Smith , who wrote the accompanying story on the Nigerian coup , was Nairobi bureau chief from 1962 to 1964 and again in 1969 . In 1972 Random House published his biography of Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere , We Must Run While They Walk . <P> Says Smith of Africa : " The excitement of the early 1960s is long since past , and the task of building independent Africa has taken a lot longer and been far more painful than anyone in the beginning imagined .
