$ When word leaked last summer that Israel had secretly test-fired a medium- range missile into the Mediterranean Sea in May , reports said the missile was designed to carry a nuclear warhead and could travel 900 nautical miles , far enough to strike Soviet territory . But intelligence sources now say the exercise had an additional purpose : to test the country 's capability of launching a surveillance satellite into low earth orbit . <P> Today Jerusalem is on the verge of sending up such a satellite for the first time . All that remains is for the Israeli Cabinet to set a launch date . When lift-off occurs , Israel will become only the eighth country  --  after the Soviet Union , U.S. , France , Japan , China , Britain and India  --  known to possess a rocket powerful enough to put a satellite into space . With its own orbiting electronic eye constantly monitoring Arab states , Israel would gain a distinct advantage in any military confrontation with its neighbors . In addition , Israel would no longer be forced to depend on U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to produce a sophisticated satellite , work on the project did not begin until 1983 , when Jerusalem created a space agency . Dubbed Shavit ( Hebrew for comet ) , the rocket was built jointly by Rafael , the country 's leading missile manufacturer , and Israel Aircraft Industries , creator of the Lavi jet fighter . Various electronics companies developed the satellite . Initially , the Israelis plan to launch an experimental satellite that will survive less than a month . If that mission is successful , the Israelis are expected to put up a satellite with a life-span of about two years . <P> Israeli defense officials , however , are divided over timing . Those who want to launch the satellite as soon as possible argue that in the wake of the Iran-Iraq cease-fire and recent missile purchases by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , Jerusalem needs to watch its Arab neighbors more closely . Those who prefer to wait argue that a launch now would only push Arab countries into beseeching Moscow for satellites of their own , thus fueling the region 's arms race and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to improve relations with Moscow . The ten members of Israel 's inner Cabinet are expected to make a decision within the next few weeks . Another consideration : some Israeli politicians fear that if a satellite is launched before the country 's November elections , the public will consider the move a cynical ploy to win votes . <P> Until now , Israel has relied on reconnaissance aircraft and high-tech drones for its intelligence . In addition , since Arab forces took Israel by surprise in the 1973 October War , the U.S. has provided Jerusalem with top-secret satellite information to help meet its defense needs . But the Israelis complain that U.S. officials " filter " the information , omitting data that Washington deems irrelevant . The Israelis also grumble that they receive the data too late . Israel regularly petitions the U.S. for its own ground links to American satellites , but Washington refuses . Supporters of Israel blame America 's stinginess with its data for Israel 's recruitment of Jonathan Jay Pollard , the former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who was sentenced to life imprisonment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
