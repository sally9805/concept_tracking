Some of the best students at Bridgewater State College are spending their Saturdays working at a course which gives neither pay nor academic credit . They are learning to teach children with physical , psychological and emotional handicaps how to deal more competently with life . Adapted Physical Education is the name of the discipline , but the 85 students who work in the Children ' s Physical Development Clinic are not necessarily majoring in physical education . Each student clinician is responsible for one child , responsible for observing and assessing his special needs and planning an individual educational plan for him , under the direction of Dr. Joseph Huber , professor of health and physical education at Bridgewater State College . The clinic , which is the only one of its kind in New England , was founded nine years ago by Huber along the lines of the first children ' s developmental clinic in the country , started 25 years ago by his teacher , Dr. Warren Johnson at the University of Maryland . Johnson ' s philosophy behind his clinic was " Love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter upon others . " Huber adds , " Our clinicians confer such love , and we gather that at least as much is conferred upon them by the children . The most difficult part of the clinic is getting the children to leave the Kelly Gym on Saturdays . " The one-to-one teaching done by the students is based on lectures by health specialists and weekly training sessions , taught by Huber and his assistant director , Prof. Johanne Smith and group leaders , students who have had a year or more of experience and notable success in the clinic . Watching a retarded child or one with cerebral palsy learn to play ball shows a visitor the difference between coaching a child in sports and teaching a handicapped child how to join other children is the best game in town . " The play ethic is more important than the work ethic , " Huber says . " And being able to handle a ball can transform the life of a brain-damaged child . " Even skills which are completely taken for granted by average children , like walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child how to walk like an Indian princess in front of a mirror . Climbing the stairs is not only a triumph in self esteem for a child with curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ) but it is a corrective exercise , which may help to ward off a surgical fusion of her spine . Adapted physical education students heard a lecture on scoliosis at a medical student ' s level this week by Florence Whiteley , an R.P.T. at Tufts University . Students who plan to teach school were invited to a workshop later in the week on screening children for the progressive disease , a process now mandated in grades 5-9 in Massachusetts . But skills in getting around physically are only part of the pattern of adapted physical education . Teachers work with handicapped youngsters ( children from 18 months to their early 20s ) on physical fitness , individual and team games , swimming , dance and lifetime sports . Sports were the magnet which drew Huber to the field . " I wanted to be a coach . Perhaps it was partly because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because sports alone didn ' t seem enough , that led me to work for a PhD in clinical psychology . " The history of adapted physical education began more than 100 years ago in Boston , in 1880 , when Dr. Dudley A. Sargent developed a program for physicians to establish physical education to meet individual needs . With the growth of interest in team sports like baseball and basketballfrom 1910-1920 the need for coaches grew and their training became more and more sophisticated . In 1965 , Eunice Kennedy Shriver challenged Americans to meet the needs of the handicapped . The challenge became a mandate when Massachusetts passed chapter 766 , calling for the mainstreaming of handicapped children into regular classrooms insofar as their needs could be met . Both the Massachusetts law and the Federal Law ( 94- 142 ) define physical education as a primary service to be included as a vital part of every student ' s individual educational prescription . Furthermore the laws call for service based on need , not on the ability of the school to provide it . Both the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimensions of physical education for the handicapped should exceed those for general physical education . Last year 14 students who were majoring in Adapted Physical Education/ Motor Development graduated from Bridgewater State and all were hired immediately in clinics , hospitals or schools . Helping parents to reinforce the skills learned by their children in the clinic is part of each student ' s job . Clinicians telephone parents each week to report on the progress made and steps to be worked on . " Some day I hope to start clinics for middle aged people and geriatrics , " says Huber . " As it is , we have to turn away many children , not because they can ' t afford the $35 semester fee , because in those cases we call upon businesses or agencies to help financially , but in order to keep the spectrum of handicaps broad enough for students to work with a large cross section of children . " Human services as Huber sees them add up to " human satisfaction . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
