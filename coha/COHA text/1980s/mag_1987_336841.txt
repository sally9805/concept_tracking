When the brown , 690-page congressional report on the Iran-contra fiasco finally thumped onto desks in Washington last week , one of the officials most keenly interested in the scandal vowed not to pick it up . Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh can not use any testimony that witnesses gave to the House and Senate committees under grants of immunity . Walsh and his staff of 28 lawyers , 20 FBI agents and six IRS investigators must build their own criminal cases against any lawbreakers . Nonetheless , the tightly reasoned , judiciously stated majority report , signed by all of the committees ' 15 Democrats as well as by three Republican Senators , contains ample reasons why Walsh and his crew are likely to push hard for indictments of several participants in the Iran-contra affair . <P> In one of the report 's most notable conclusions , the bipartisan majority declares flatly that the profits generated by the sale of U.S. arms to Iran were the rightful property of the Federal Government , not of the so-called enterprise operated by retired Major General Richard Secord and his Iranian- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nicaraguan contras " constituted a misappropriation of government funds , " the report claims . If Walsh and a federal grand jury concur , Secord and Hakim may face indictments . So , too , may former National Security Adviser John Poindexter , who approved the diversion , and former-NSC Staffer Oliver North , who directed the enterprise . <P> Secord and Hakim benefited more from the arms sales than the contras did , according to the report . Of the $16 million in Iran arms profits , the contras received just $3.8 million . Secord , who testified that he sold weapons to the contras with a profit markup of 20% , actually took profits that averaged 38% and sometimes reached 56% . When Contra Leader Adolfo Calero discovered he could buy weapons far more cheaply through a European arms dealer , North made sure that none of the Iran arms proceeds went directly to Calero . Instead they went to Secord , who continued to sell to Calero at inflated prices . <P> Similarly , the report relates how the private fund raisers Carl Channell and Richard Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4.5 million on the rebel forces . The rest of the money went into lavish offices , fancy limousines and high salaries . The two have pleaded guilty to tax fraud for claiming that their operations were entitled to an IRS exemption . <P> Walsh has been presenting witnesses to a grand jury at a stepped-up pace of three times a week . One of the witnesses last week was Attorney General Edwin Meese , who is sharply criticized in the report for failing to seek advice before telling the President that he could legally sell arms to Iran without informing Congress . Meese testified that he relied on an opinion written in 1981 by former Attorney General William French Smith . But the report points out that Smith had advised that Congress would have to be notified once arms shipments were under way . Said the report : " There is only one reason to have an attorney general on the NSC : to give the President independent and sound advice . That did not happen in the Iran affair and the President was poorly served . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
