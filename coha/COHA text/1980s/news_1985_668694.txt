The idea for the book came slowly , opening up its possibilities like a flower in sap-rising time . The blooming occured , of all places , in the swaying coaches of now-defunct railroad passenger trains that not so long ago used to pound southwestward out of Chicago , across Illinois , into southeast Iowa , then finally into the rolling land of northern Missouri . William Hesterberg , a creative director for the Young &; Rubicam advertising agency in Chicago , used to board the Santa Fe at Chicago ' s Dearborn Street Station for his trips home to Norborne , population 900-plus , a farming community in the Missiour River bottomland : sleepy small-town America , surrounded by corn and soybean fields , marked by a big water tower and a couple of grain elevators . Just a town like a thousand others . For the trains that sped through , Norborne was just a flash , a second or two on the way to Kansas City where the sidewalks didn ' t roll up automatically at 9 p. m . Norborne , for train crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then was gone , a few lights that quickly became specks behind the red tail light of the caboose in the early morning darkness . Those specks of light , those flashes , fascinated Hesterberg , who is also an artist and publisher of small letterpress editions . In time , they came to inspire him , and as a result he has just published a book of photographs that is his answer to the universal question of whether people can go home again . To Hesterberg , the book is proof that you can . His way was to take a camera , some lights and plenty of film . Getting to the point of inspiration took years . Rolling out of the north in the all-but-empty railroad coaches , Hesterberg would press his face to the window , as he had as a child decades earlier , and see other towns in Iowa and Illinois , towns like his hometown , roughly the same size . Those towns went whoosh too : a flash , a handfull of lights giving the only clue that outside the coach window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people laughed and cried , were born and died , and felt joys and sorrow of the human condition . At first those lights were just " places " to Hesterberg , disembodied spots on the route between Chicago and his destination . They were places where someone had left a few lights on , places where the lights were powered by some far-off electrical generating plant , places so insignificant that the train didn ' t even bother to slow down . But he always looked out the coach window . And after a time it came to Hesterberg that those little towns were more than just specks of light . The towns were people  --  anonymous , faceless people who , if they were up late , might hear the diesel horn of the train engine as it approached the first grade crossing outside town . Or people who might turn in their sleep as the train rumbled through . But that was all . They would awake the next day and go about their business  --  the train and Hesterberg long gone  --  and remain what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintances . They were like the majority of people , not just the ones in small towns , but those in big cities , too . Anonymous , unchronicled . And something else . Once those people died , their images would fade , and not just in the memories of those who knew or loved them . Their pictures would fade , literally . People would pull out scrapbooks and point to photographs , browning slowly with age . Yet even that wouldn ' t be enough , Hesterberg thought , because most people took their photographs by standing back , getting the sun behind them , and maybe trying to get the family car in the picture , too . Usually , when the pictures came home from the drugstore , there were lots of trees and cars . But the faces would be barely visible , showing none of the lines on Grandma ' s face , lines she hated but which her grandchildren loved . Or the pictures would only hint at the favorite cap an uncle wore . Or they ' d miss altogether the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Little things . Things that could trigger a flood a memories despite their seeming insignificance . Drugstore pictures rarely showed such details . And Hesterberg got to thinking about Norborne and the people he had known as a child and a teenager . People consigned to the same , faceless anonymity . Not that the people really cared . Norborne was home . Just as little towns in western Illinois and southeastern Iowa were home to others , places where the trains rumbled through and were gone . Places where one could look up and see the lines of white in the sky , left by airline jets flying from New York to Los Angeles or from San Francisco to Chicago , places where people trade on recognition . There was no fame in Norborne . People here went about their business , year after year , life after life , trading only in milo and corn and beans and hogs , where people were satisfied with being " out there , " a phrase the movers and shakers seem to fall back on when talking about middle America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much like Norborne , " said Hesterberg , who is now 47 . " And they weren ' t just lights , just places . They were people . " So Hesterberg decided to do a book on Norborne . The result is " Portrait of Home , " a limited and numbered edition of 900 books ( $37. 50 , available at the Oak Street Bookshop in Chicago and the Chestnut Court Bookshop in Winnetka ) . Hesterberg ' s book is pictures , uncropped enlargements taken from more than a thousand 35 mm. negatives that Hesterberg shot with an Olympus OM-1 camera using Tri-X black-and-white film rated at 200 ASA to reduce graininess . Oh , Hesterberg took some shots of the town . But the book is mostly faces , from Mary Elizabeth Adams and John Adams on the frontpiece to Elsie Witte at the back  --  pictures of people looking directly at the camera , some smiling , some serious , many of them with their hands folded in front of them . There are no stories , just photographs , which are eloquent enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgil Finn ) and the eyes ( Kathleen Boedhmer ) and a spring-morning smile ( Claire Raasch ) . The subjects look comfortable . They should . Hesterberg was no stranger , something that helped ease the way . He was Fritz Hesterberg ' s son , the kid who used to cut lawns all over town and who helped out at the blacksmith shop where his father , with an anvil and welding torch , kept folks ' farm machinery in one piece . A lot of the people he took pictures of called him " Billy . " The photographs were taken between 1978 and 1982 . It took a couple of years after that to get the book out . Hesterberg doesn ' t kid himself to think that he has made the people in the book " famous . " But he knows , in years down the road , when people want to know what people looked like in these latter years of the 20th Century , well , they can look at what he did . It ' s all there , even as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red light on the caboose receding into the darkness or , if you ' re on the train , the lights of the town becoming just specks amid the blackness .
