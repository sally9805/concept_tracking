The Moeller farm on Mormon Island , Neb. , lies right in the path of the central flyway , a great avian migratory route that runs from central Mexico to eastern Siberia . Through it each spring pass 560,000 sandhill cranes , 9 million ducks and geese , more than 500 bald eagles , 104 piping plovers , 110 least terns and 96 of the world 's remaining population of 171 whooping cranes . Few bird watchers are lucky enough to spot the latter along their 2,500-mile flight from the Gulf Coast of Texas to Canada 's Northwest Territories . They are secretive , and they travel in small groups . But no one in the area along Nebraska 's Platte River can avoid encountering the whooper 's brethren , the sandhills , which tarry for weeks in concentrations of 20,000 per mile . <P> The gathering of sandhill cranes on and around the Moeller farm is one of nature 's most spectacular rites of spring . " It is , " writes Ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson , " the largest concentration of any species of crane anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedes sunrise , the sandhills roosting in the shallows might be mistaken for carvings on a stone frieze . Soon the frieze begins to ripple with motion as the cranes stretch their wings and , voices rising , take off in small groups of 20 and 30 . For over an hour , the river casts out lines of great gray birds . They soar over winter-brown pasture and goldencorn stubble  --  giant kites on invisible strings . But sandhill cranes can not pass for paper birds very long . The racket they make gives them away . <P> Listening to the sandhills is much like hearing unfamiliar and cacophonous music . Cranes can not be said to sing . Rather , they are a whole orchestra that can reproduce at one and the same time the sound of geese honking , frogs croaking , cats purring , whistles blowing , castanets clicking , trumpets blaring , flutes trilling and even the roaring cheers of a fully packed football stadium . " As soon as you hear it , " nods Don Howell , a retired telephone company man from nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The annual chorus is a familiar sound to Pat and Larry Moeller . " It 's eerie , " says Pat . " A couple of weeks ago , there were so many they filled the sky , and there was not a one that did n't have its mouth open . " The Moellers live in a white farmhouse on 400 acres of land that used to belong to Larry 's father and uncle , and before that his grandfather , and before that his great grandfather . Next year , however , title to the property will pass to a local conservation group called the Platte River Whooping Crane Maintenance Trust . " It 's kind of sad to see it go , " says Larry of the sale of the family homestead . " But my dad and uncle are both retiring , and I guess they wanted a little cash in their pockets . " For as long as he can remember , Larry Moeller has associated the cranes with the coming of spring . This year the first pairs landed on Feb. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since , the Moellers have become bird-watcher watchers . Led by a guide from the trust , cars and campers with license plates from all over the country parade daily by the farmhouse looking for cranes . At dawn and at dusk , the visitors gather in a large blind built of concrete blocks and sunk into a riverside berm like a war-zone bunker . In crane country it is people who are the interlopers.
