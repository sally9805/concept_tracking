With the Federal deficit listing toward $200 billion , with unemployment the highest in 42 years and with bankruptcies mounting , Representative Yates , chairman of the House subcommittee that originates appropriations bills for the arts and humanities , keeps putting money for the arts back into appropriations bills. // This has lead some of his critics to suggest that he is a legislative Nero fiddling away amid the flames of economic disaster . Of course Mr. Yates , an Illinois Democrat , sees things differently . He prefers to compare himself to another Roman , Horatius , standing at the bridge , defending the Federal role in the arts and humanities. // " Yes , we have big deficits and we have high unemployment , but the difference I have with this Administration is over whether there should be any Federal assistance for the arts at all , " he said the other day . " I think the Reagan Administration would be against any Federal funds for the arts . " <> <> ' Economic Contribution ' Cited // Mr. Yates charged that the Reagan Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts as the lowest of the priorities and wanted to cut them in half on the way to ending them entirely . " He readily conceded that jobs and citizens ' personal security should have the highest priority , but he argued that that the arts and humanities also make very important contributions to the life of the country. // " The arts make an economic contribution to the prosperity of the country as well as enhancing the quality of life of the American people , " he said . " That ' s why I think it is important to make a Federal contribution to the arts. " // He asserted that it would not be in keeping with the traditions of the nation to remove the subsidies . Besides , he noted , Federal aid to the arts and humanities accounts for only a small fraction of a Federal budget that amounts to nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars. // Mr. Reagan , who is committed to cutting Federal support for the arts while encouraging the private sector to take up the slack , had proposed cutting the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million to $100 million . At Mr. Yates ' s behest , Congress appropriated $143 million. // Similarly , the President proposed cutting the National Endowment for the Humanities from $130 million to $96 million . Congress appropriated $130 million . <> <> Museum Funds Restored // And so it has gone vote after vote . Following Mr. Yates ' s lead , Congress has restored funds for the Institute of Museum Services , the Smithsonian Institution , the National Gallery of Art and the Historic Preservation Fund. // The chairman of the Congressional Arts Caucus , Representative Thomas J. Downey , Democrat of Suffolk , has high praise for Mr. Yates . " This is good news , very good news , for the arts and humanities , " he said of the restored monies . " These funding levels will insure that artistic activity will continue to grow across America. " // Mr. Yates points out that he has supported a wide range of programs , such as those in health , education and science , and that he was a leader in opposing an American supersonic transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a singular area of interest , the military. // As for the Administration ' s goal of having the private sector do more while the Federal Government does less , Mr. Yates said , " Even in prosperous times , the private role was not adequate to take care of the needs of the arts and humanities , to keep theaters alive , to keep the dance alive . Operas and symphonies were strapped . " Now , he said , with the economy in its long recession , the Federal role is needed even more. // " Kennedy and Johnson found that the arts were a proper role for the Government , " Mr. Yates continued . " Every President , including Republicans , funded the arts on higher levels until the Reagan Administration came along . " <> <> ' One of the Most Liberal ' // Unlike some of his ideological kin in Congress these days , Mr. Yates cheerfully accepts being described as a liberal . " That ' s true , " he said . " I am one of the most liberal members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has less to do with his support of the arts and humanities than does his Chicago background. // " Chicago is one of our great cities for museums , " he said , noting that his district contains a number of institutions that stand to gain from Federal grants to the arts and humanities . " I attended the University of Chicago , which is known for its humanities programs , and I ' ve always supported the humanities. " // Mr. Yates ' s legislative power comes partly from his persuasiveness and partly from his chairmanship of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior . The chairmanship came about in part as a result of his seniority . Mr. Yates was first elected to Congress in 1948 and will be the seventh-highest ranking member of the House in the 98th Congress ; he would have been the third-highest ranking member if he had not skipped the 1962 House contest to run an unsuccessful race for the Senate against Everett McKinley Dirksen. // " Sure , I ' m senior , " he said . " I would have been more senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tremendous following , but I thought I had a chance . Mayor Daley asked me if I wanted to run and , since I wanted to be a Senator , I said yes. " // Mr. Yates had to run for re-election last November in a new district that included some suburbs that normally are more Republican than the city of Chicago , and he was targeted for defeat by some conservative groups . But he won with 67 percent of the vote , a big margin even though it was 6 percentage points below his best showing in 1980. // " Those who think the conservatives have taken over are wrong , " Mr. Yates said . " There is a big following for liberals. " //
