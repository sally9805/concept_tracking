But the roles of spear carriers - and servants , gentlewomen , rudimentary mechanicals and miscellaneous citizens of every port from London to Alexandria - in the New York Shakespeare Festival ' s productions at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park are the fledgling nonunion actor ' s single major stage opportunity in New York. // The roster of those whose careers have begun as extras at the Delacorte includes Daniel J. Travanti , Peter Bogdanovich , Kelly McGillis and the male leads in both 1988 productions : Kevin Kline , who starred in " Much Ado About Nothing , " and Jay O. Saunders , who plays the Bastard in the current production , " King John. " // This way into the theater is possible because the Delacorte ' s contract allows the Shakespeare Festival to offer a number of nonunion contracts every summer . And although working in these productions doesn ' t satisfy the requirements for obtaining the Actors ' Equity membership needed to be hired for Equity productions , the benefits are twofold : everybody in New York ' s theater community goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are initiated into the Shakespeare Festival ' s network , which means employment. // Laura Samitz , who was in both 1988 ensembles , began her summer as a nonunion actress . By summer ' s end , she had been cast in Hy Kraft ' s " Cafe Crown , " the first production of the winter season at the Public , which got her her union card . The track record is enough to make the ambitious spear carrier ' s palms itch . Rosemarie Tischler , the Shakespeare Festival ' s head of casting , estimates that at least 65 percent of the Delacorte extras from the past decade are among today ' s working actors. // Over a two-week period each spring Ms. Tischler and her associates audition some 300 actors chosen through agents ' submissions , university programs and walk-ins , each of whom delivers a one-to-two-minute Shakespearean monologue . " I just tell myself that I ' ll be surrounded by beautiful language all day , " Ms. Tischler said. // The number chosen varies from summer to summer depending on the production . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so this has been a banner year for spear carriers . In all , there are 17 extras in " King John. " // Once through the audition , the spear carrier must navigate the hazards of rehearsal and the stage itself . On a recent sweltering Saturday morning , for example , B. H. Barry , " King John ' s " fight director , was preparing the cast for the large-scale battle sequences . The rehearsal hall was crowded with more than 25 able-bodied men , all of them armed . The leads had broadswords ; everybody else , spears , daggers and the occasional pike. // Mr. Barry called everyone to attention : " O.K. , I want to run ' The Melee . ' " A figure called from the center of the crowd , " You guys with the swords - when you run through the crowd , remember there are people on both sides of you . " Jane White , a veteran of early Delacorte seasons who has returned as Elinor in " King John , " strode to the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . Choreographed pandemonium ensued . In the silence that followed , a prone figure called from an upstage corner , " Are we dead here or should we be moaning ? " The entire room began to moan in unison. // In performance , the actors make other discoveries . For example , time , when it ' s spent offstage , can drag on longer than the Wars of the Roses. // At the Delacorte , of course , there is also the weather factor . " On Broadway there can be so few surprises , " observed Mr. Kline , whose first New York stage appearance was in the ensemble of " The Wars of the Roses " in 1970 , " but here - who knows ? You could be hit by lightning. " // So many performances of " Much Ado About Nothing " were rained out this summer , the run was extended . On the nights that the show did play , the wet was still felt . " Much Ado ' s " equivalent of spear carriers were responsible for maneuvering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circular platform considerably heavier than its designed weight. // " The thing got to weigh so much , " 23-year-old Graham Winton recalled , " that it took twice the number of people to manage it , and sometimes it still wouldn ' t budge . We finally had to use big metal hooks to lug it around . One night I came out and stuck my hook in , pulled with all my might , and saw my feet in front of my face . I fell flat down on my back . The house loved it. " // As both actors and onlookers , the anonymous lords , ladies and lackeys dressing the action have a special perspective on why both actors and audiences are so faithful to the Delacorte . The actors are , as Mr. Kline described , " surrounded by Shakespeare . You get to hear the play every night , to become familiar with the texts by being surrounded by them . It ' s the best way to learn Shakespeare. " // For 26-year-old Ms. Samitz , the lessons were every bit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve learned so much from watching these people work , from watching the various generations of actors . Like the older gentlemen - with us , everything is such a big deal , but they ' re so calm , so professional . Watching Kevin , I learned about timing and about how to work with an audience . He gives the same performance every night , but you watch him adapt to each audience . He knows exactly what he needs to do , how to build an audience. " // The spear carrier ' s lot may be small , but it is secure . Somebody ' s got to do it , and Shakespeare is the reward on the other side . " There ' s nothing in the world I ' d rather be doing than this , " says Mr. Saunders , whose route to the Bastard in the current " King John " began in 1976 behind a spear in " Henry V. " " It ' s what I ' m in this for . This is the richest it gets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers that lesson - that proximity is what counts or , as Hamlet says , " The readiness is all . " After all , legend has it that Shakespeare ' s own first job in the theater was tying up the horses outside. //
