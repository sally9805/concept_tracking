" The knives are out . If Deng died tomorrow , this place would be a real mess . " With those blunt words , a senior Western diplomat in Peking summarized the view of China watchers around the world about the country 's new power struggle . Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping appears to be in trouble , and his vaunted economic reforms may also be imperiled . <P> The question of whether Deng is still in charge was first raised in January , when his protege and handpicked successor , Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang , was abruptly ousted after being blamed for disruptive student demonstrations in December . Deng immediately spread the word that he had favored both Hu 's ouster and a crackdown against the students , who were demanding more democracy . <P> The wily Deng , 82 , seemed to be using his lifelong tactic of playing off the major political factions against one another in order to stay on top . After Hu 's removal , the Chinese press continued to hold Deng up as the leading opponent of " bourgeois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main sin of both Hu and the students . Deng , according to a party document made available to Western reporters last week , had been an early critic of the ex-party chief 's six major " errors , " one of which was that he encouraged too much buying of consumer goods . But China watchers are wondering if Deng is still leading the crackdown or , like Hu , has become a victim of it . Says one Peking intellectual : " At the very least , Deng 's recent moves have been forced and involuntary . " <P> The man emerging as Deng 's leading rival is another octogenarian , Peng Zhen , 84 , chairman of the National People 's Congress and a Marxist of the old school . Peng , a contender for top party posts in the early 1960s , was purged in 1966 . He is reported to be bitter that he has never been elevated by Deng to the party 's top echelon . However , he has turned the Congress , once a legislative rubber stamp , into a center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China is always difficult , and Western diplomats hope to learn more about Deng 's status during a visit to Peking this week by Secretary of State George Shultz . The signs of Deng 's declining influence have been proliferating in recent weeks . The Chinese leader 's public statements have become few and Delphian , and though he is frequently quoted in the press , most of the citations are from speeches he made at least four years ago . <P> The first hard evidence that Deng was slipping came on Feb. 16 , when major Chinese newspapers published a 1962 speech he made attacking Mao Tse-tung for both his one-man rule and his disastrous economic policies during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 . Some observers took this as an attack on Deng 's own leadership . Said one Asian diplomat : " I ca n't believe Deng wanted that old speech to be printed . It is too easy to interpret as an attack on himself . "                    @
