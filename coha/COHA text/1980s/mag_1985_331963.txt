Affirmative action is rooted in an uncomfortable reality : that to remedy the effects of past discrimination against blacks and women it is sometimes necessary to discriminate against white men . The Government shied from stating the proposition so boldly , but beginning with the Nixon Administration it put the principle into practice . Throughout the ' 70s Washington pressed employers to set explicit goals and timetables for the hiring of minorities , even if that meant tacitly accepting " reverse discrimination . " <P> Ronald Reagan has tried to stage a countermarch . At his first press conference after he took office in 1981 , Reagan said that some affirmative action programs had been " distorted " into quota systems . " I 'm old enough to remember , " he said , " when quotas existed in the U.S. for the purpose of discrimination , and I do n't want to see that happen again . " Since then , his Justice Department has aggressively attacked the use of racial preference in hiring and promotion . William Bradford Reynolds , the outspoken chief of the Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done more harm than good . " It 's demeaning because it says people are going to get ahead not because of what they can do , but because of their race . " <P> Reversing the momentum built by more than a decade of affirmative action has not been easy . Many judges , educators and personnel directors have come to accept racial preference in hiring and school admissions . " Affirmative action is alive and well in this country , " says Barbara Schlei , a Los Angeles attorney who represents management in employment cases . Nonetheless , the climate that nurtured affirmative action has begun to cool perceptibly . " Most companies in the private sector are providing no more than lip service to affirmative action , " says Milton Vickers , director of minority business development for Dade County , Fla . " There has been little monitoring for the past four or five years , and you can tell . " <P> Since 1970 the Federal Government has required companies that do business with it to submit affirmative action plans . There are about 15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past three years the Administration has been trying to ease federal rules that in the past have required employers to set fairly ambitious hiring goals and timetables . When civil rights groups blocked the rule changes by threatening to sue , the Reaganauts resorted to nonenforcement . Under earlier Administrations , 26 companies were barred from doing business with the Federal Government because of affirmative action violations . Under Reagan , none have been so barred . <P> Last summer the Justice Department thought it gained a key ally in its assault on affirmative action . In Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 vs . Stotts , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a lower court judge had no right to force the layoff of white fire fighters in Memphis in order to protect black hiring and promotion gains under a court-ordered affirmative action plan . The language of the court 's opinion appeared to go well beyond the facts of the case . Writing for the majority , Justice Byron White declared that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was intended only to protect individual victims of proven discrimination . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference , the court 's ruling seemed to argue against broad remedies .
