( JACK IS TALKING WITH HIS FRIENDS , JED , CICERO AND SAMONDS AT CICERO 'S COIN SHOP , A NARROW STORE-FRONT IN WHICH CICERO SELLS AND TRADES . JED IS IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLING A JOINT , WHICH HE LIGHTS AND PASSES DURING THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION . CICERO IS THE ONLY ONE WHO REFUSES TO TAKE THE JOINT AS IT IS PASSED . HE SITS WITH A BEER IN HIS HAND , OCCASIONALLY SIPPING IT . ) CICERO He invented the gyroplane . If that is n't just like the white man 's thinking . It would propel him into the air and hold him there until the earth turned . Then the gyroplane would let him down and he 'd be in a different place . JED ( GIVES AN INDIAN HOOT , THE OTHERS HOWL . ) Do n't look down ! CICERO Wovoka told the Indians to keep dancing . And when the Great Spirit came , He would lift the Indian into the mountains , high up where he would be safe . He should take the animals . Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people would die . After that the water would go away and nobody would be on the earth again except Indians and game . The Indian who did n't dance would go up just a few feet , not to the mountains . JED I agree with old Wovoka , Cicero . Let 's propel . ( HE LAUGHS AND OFFERS THE JOINT TO SAMONDS. ) p. 3 BOUDINOT My wife will smell this on me and I 'll be in trouble . SAMONDS You 're the only one of us that settled down , Cicero , and you do n't even have a wife . You made a bundle in this coin shop , and we 're still following the rodeo . Jed here wants to join the circus . JED The fuck I do . SAMONDS That Cicero could pick up a blown tire on the highway and sell it for a bear claw . CICERO Samonds is like following the red gasoline truck down the road . You always know what 's sloshing around inside . JED Hey , it 's Jack 's old lady who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time I called for a ride . BOUDINOT Yeah , she schemes like her daddy . She thought money was going to fall off that depot roof like dead pigeons . She wants a house , a car , a washing machine . Hell , she 's got a list . But her old man signed the papers to sell that railroad station on the corner of their property . It 's as much hers as his , she says . But he signs the papers for a lot less than what she thinks it 's worth . I talked to him , but he 's already signed . Cree 's old man thinks that now she 's got me to take care of her , he 's off the hook . Her mother 's got that job with the county . She 's doing better than all of us , except maybe Cicero. p. 4 CICERO Shit , man . I 'm back with my mother just to get a supper . JED You just ca n't cook , you lazy ass . SAMONDS We could spook Cree 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Great Father . The depot master . Telling him he ca n't sell the station . BOUDINOT Yeah ! Some night when he gets drunk out there on that abandoned place by the garbage dump where he lives . We could speak to him from the dead . CICERO All aboard ! I hear the last train leaving . BOUDINOT That dumb Indian do n't know what anything is worth . It 'd serve him right . ( CICERO MAKES A COYOTE HOWL. ) @x ( THE STAIRS TO JACK AND CREE 'S APARTMENT OVER THE WEEMS ' GARAGE . LODY SITS ON THE BACKSTEPS BY HERSELF PETTING THE RABBIT SHE CALLS BABY HARE . ) WEEMS ( LODY STOPS A MOMENT BUT CONTINUES TO PET THE RABBIT . ) Sometimes I pet your fur when it 's cold , Baby Hare , and I see the sparks . That 's how I know the stars are your father . ( CREE COMES DOWN THE BACKSTEPS AND SETS BY LODY . LODY SPEAKS TO HER . ) There 's a narrow path through the neighbor 's wisteria bush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the path and he can not . CREE How are you this evening , Lody ? WEEMS I 'm fine but for this black bull rabbit with a mind of his own . CREE It 's a nice evening . WEEMS I stuffed the buck-wheat sun into the flour-sack so night would come . CREE You did a nice job of it . WEEMS Then the high stars over the garage can play . And the stairs to the garage apartment . CREE You ca n't go up there , Lody. p. 10 WEEMS Why ? CREE That 's where Jack and I live with the boys . WEEMS Garah Weems , my mother , is there . CREE No , she 's not , Lody . ( LODY PETS HER RABBIT . ) She might have been there a long time ago , but now she 's gone . WEEMS Where did she go ? CREE I do n't know . It all works out . Maybe there 's a place people go when things get too hard for them  --  WEEMS See that bull , Taurus , Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SHE LOOKS AT THE SKY. ) @x ( THE COIN SHOP AGAIN . ) BOUDINOT So the lawyer says he wo n't take the case because we might not recover the cost of taking the old man to court . Cree did n't want to anyway . I do n't know why . What did he ever do for her but disappoint ? ( TOSSES THE DICE , LOSES . ) Is n't that the way it always is ? ( OTHERS CONTINUE TO ROLL . ) My old lady is still looking for the egg man . JED Egg man ? BOUDINOT Anyone to take her away . CICERO Not Cree . BOUDINOT I want to be more to her than the scarecrow keeping the crows away . CICERO You 're drinking too much , old son . You do n't know what you 're saying . SAMONDS Yeah , Jack . You 're crazy . No one 's going to take a woman with three kids away from you . JED You 're safe there . Bet on it . CICERO She would n't go away . BOUDINOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the salvage yard and dig through old cars for coins for Cicero 's shop . p. 13 JED We could put Cicero on the mechanical bull . BOUDINOT I want to climb on the side of the chute again and look down on a bull . Chute number five 's my lucky  --  I want to straddle that bull , put my one hand under the rope and hold the other one in the air . I want to feel that bull leap from the open gate . Feel that bastard jump like a mountain  --  and be jerked nearly out of my eyes . Not able to see anything but the stars . Knees up . Feet out . Chin down . Pumping my legs every time he jumps  --  the whole thrust . The staying on . The ride ! ( HE GETS UP , JUMPS UP AND DOWN ACROSS THE FLOOR . ) Yip . Yiee . Yip . Yip .

AS HE STRAIGHTENS UP , HE BUMPS HIS HEAD . HE WIPES HIS HANDS ON THE DRESS . A COUNTRY SONG PLAYS SOMEWHERE IN THE BACKGROUND . ) CREE Just two years ago I wore that dress . BOUDINOT You were the only girl at the rodeo in a dress . CREE I had to go to a wedding and did n't think to take my jeans . I would have missed your ride if I 'd gone home to change . But I was there to see you get thrown . BOUDINOT Nothing 's changed . CREE It 's why I noticed you . The brave way you fell . BOUDINOT A star on a bull . Bull Star . CREE I did n't mean it that way . WEEMS He 's your father , Baby Hare . BOUDINOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't much of a star . p. 15 CREE You 're the only one I remember . BOUDINOT ( THROWS DOWN THE RAG . ) Maybe Howard can look at this . CREE I ca n't travel with you now like I did when we were first married . I got the children . They tie me down . I want to hold you down with me . BOUDINOT I still think I can ride , Cree . You got to let me take a chance . CREE How many chances does it take ? BOUDINOT I feel trapped . Like clothes I had to wear when they got too small . They cut me under the arms . It 's like wearing jeans that do n't come down to your ankles . CREE Highwaters . BOUDINOT You 're looking at a dress you ca n't fit in anymore and you 're thinking where are you going to get the money for another one . CREE Where do I go I need a dress ? I 'd rather have you . Maybe we 'll get that old railroad station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving it away . BOUDINOT That 's about the same as counting on rodeo money . WEEMS The bull star 's his father , and I am mother of the rabbit-child. p. 16 BOUDINOT I suppose the star of Bethlehem is shining too . CREE He does n't resemble either one of you , Lody . But he 's handsome . One of the nicest babies I 've seen . BOUDINOT And she has seen babies . WEEMS Shhhh ! His father comes . BOUDINOT I have to rodeo , Cree . CREE I thought I could hold you , but it never works . My mother could n't hold my father . BOUDINOT I 'm just going to be gone a few days , Cree . Your mother was better off without your father anyway . WEEMS ( STARTS TO WHINE . ) Be nice , Baby Hare . Your father , Taurus , is coming . CREE I would like to leave too . I would like to wake in the morning without three crying babies who want to be fed . ( CREE ROCKS HER CARD-BOARD BABIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a night . ( LODY WHINES AGAIN . ) Do n't whine , Lody . Pet your rabbit . It 's all right . I 'm just talking . WEEMS Taurus ! ! ( LODY STRUGGLES AS IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO TAKE HER RABBIT . ) Taurus ! ! ( LODY SCREAMS . CREE TRIES TO HOLD HER . JACK RUNS TO THEM. ) p. 17 BOUDINOT Your rabbit is all right , Lody . CREE See him in your arms ? No one is going to take him . ( THEY HOLD LODY WHILE SHE ROCKS THE RABBIT AND CREE ROCKS HER BABIES. ) @x ( THE COIN SHOP . ) CICERO I remember Lody in school . She would come with her hair uncombed . She 'd look at us like a wild animal . I think her mother was scaring her to death . One day someone tormented her until she screamed out . I can still hear her down the hall as they carried her off . JED I heard the old lady was an alcoholic . SAMONDS What do you know , Jed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck . BOUDINOT Yeah , makes everyone think he owns a rodeo horse . CICERO Maybe he 's got a spirit horse in that trailer . JED I ca n't get the hitch undone . BOUDINOT Just like everyone thinks I 'm a rodeo star . Who knows what the truth is anymore ? JED I 'd trade it for a motorcycle in a minute  --  CICERO What if there 's not one truth , but many ? SAMONDS Yeah  --  but Jed seen a driver smeared over the highway after a wreck . p. 19 JED Yeah  --  truth 's something that reproduces like rabbits . BOUDINOT Truth is something you got to live with once the stories have their turn . CICERO Truth is something you create with your stories . SAMONDS Truth is an empty jack-o-lantern . CICERO Once there was a man with a dog who told him there would be a flood . Make a raft and get on it when the rain comes . Soon the rain came and the man took his family on the raft . Well it rained for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world drowned . Then the rain stopped , and the waters went down , and they stepped off the raft . They heard dancing and shouting on the other side of the ridge . The man climbed up and looked over . Everything was still , but he saw a great pile of bones and he knew the ghosts of the people drowned had been dancing . SAMONDS Forget the stories . JED At least Jack 's got a job with the Tennepah school district . He could be like Cree 's brothers who ca n't keep their jobs . SAMONDS How come Jack got the job driving buses anyway when the rest of us ca n't find work ? Jack 's not a better mechanic than the rest of us  --  p. 20 JED He 's been in trouble too . BOUDINOT Hell . I ca n't even handle cattle on the ground . Those calves never would go down for me . But when I was above the chute looking down on that bull . When I got on it just before the gate opened and the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving and leaping in the air , and all I had was one arm around the rope , pumping my legs when he jumped . I was the bull star ! JED The egg man . SAMONDS The Cherokee grasshopper . BOUDINOT Yeah . Not much more than that . The next thing I knew , I was on the way to the ground , landing between those thrashing legs . JED Just like I knew I 'd be on a motorcycle  --  BOUDINOT I 've got to follow the rodeo this summer . I need money . SAMONDS Your old lady would n't let you leave her behind , Jack . Not with them babies to take care of . BOUDINOT You know what we should do tonight ? SAMONDS What , chief ? BOUDINOT Take Lody Weems out to the garbage dump where Cree 's father lives , and let her spook him into sharing the depot money with Cree . I could afford to take her and the babies with me to the rodeos if I had money . p. 21 JED Shoot . We told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cicero to do it . CICERO No . BOUDINOT She knows you , Cicero . You were in the same class in school . CICERO She was n't there enough for me to know her . We were all in the same class at school at one time or the other . SAMONDS It 'd be easy  --  CICERO No  --  BOUDINOT What if it worked ? CICERO Who do you think pecked under his desk when Lody screamed ?  --  ( THEY LOOK AT CICERO. ) @x ( HE OPENS THE CAR DOOR . ) WEEMS I ca n't leave Baby Hare . CICERO Bring him . He 'll be all right . Do n't you think he 'd like a ride too ? WEEMS Where are we going ? CICERO To see the country . Just sit here in the car . You never get out . WEEMS I 'm tied down with babies . My father would n't like it . CICERO Your father would n't mind . He knows me . ( SHE SITS IN THE CAR . ) How many times have I been here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Cree . ( HE CLOSES THE DOOR AND GETS IN . ) WEEMS It 's such a black night . The wide heavens are open . See the bull star ? CICERO Taurus ? ( HE BACKS OUT THE DRIVE AND THEY 'RE ON THE WAY TO THE OLD MAN 'S PLACE . ) WEEMS You know him too ? CICERO I 've heard of Taurus . p. 23 WEEMS He 's the father of Baby Hare . CICERO Yes , the hair baby is nice . Can I pet him ? WEEMS Yes . Right here behind the ears . That 's where he likes it . CICERO Does he bite ? WEEMS If he knows I 'm watching , he wo n't be afraid . CICERO ( HE PETS THE RABBIT WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE DRIVES . ) How old is he ? WEEMS He 's a baby . CICERO Lody . ( HE PAUSES . ) You like Jack , do n't you , and Cree ? WEEMS Yes . CICERO And you want to help them , do n't you ? ( LODY PETS THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to see a man who took something that belongs also to them . I want you to tell him that he ca n't do it . I want you to stand before his cabin in the moonlight and tell him that he ca n't . ( HE PAUSES . ) I was going to trick you into it , but when I see you petting your rabbit , you look so sweet . I want you to understand what we 're doing . ( LODY DOES N'T SAY ANYTHING . ) Lody , do you want to know  --  or do you just want to do what I tell you ? ( SHE STILL DOES N'T ANSWER AND HE STOPS THE CAR . ) I 'm afraid that in helping Jack and Cree I 'll hurt you . ( HE PUSHES A PIECE OF HAIR BACK FROM HER FACE . SHE MOVES OVER , AWAY FROM HIM . ) Uh , I 'm sorry  --  I 'm sorry I hurt you  --  ( PAUSE . ) I do n't want you to think it was some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man Cree knows  --  one who is trying to take something from her . And I 'll take you back to your father . p. 24 WEEMS Will it hurt him ? CICERO I do n't know . WEEMS Can Baby Hare tell him ? CICERO He 's a baby and ca n't talk . You know that , Lody . You have to talk  --  ( HE DRIVES THE CAR AGAIN . ) I can try to tell you the truth , or I can make up a story . I think you want to hear the truth , Lody . WEEMS What kind of story would you tell me ? CICERO I would say we are going to see a man who took the stars away from the night . WEEMS He did ? CICERO Yes . And they 're in a corral behind his cabin . ( SHE LAUGHS . ) But it 's not good , Lody . It 's as though he stole Taurus , the bull star , from you , and now Baby Hare does n't have a father . WEEMS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CICERO Yes , it 's that serious . But we are going to get them back so the stars can rise to the heavens and form Taurus again . Will you help ? WEEMS Yes . CICERO On this strange , windy night , I want you to stand on the hill before the old chief 's cabin and tell him he ca n't sell the depot . p. 25 WEEMS Depot ? CICERO Yes , that 's the word that will mean to him that he ca n't sell the stars . WEEMS No ! Sell the stars ? CICERO Why do you think they are rounded up in his corral ? He is going to sell Taurus at the market . WEEMS ( ALMOST SCREAMING . ) NO ! ( SHE THRASHES . ) CICERO ( STOPS THE CAR AGAIN . ) Lody . Lody ! It 's just a story . He does n't really have the stars . I was just making up a story for you . ( HE HOLDS HER , TRIES TO QUIET HER . ) Lody . It 's a story . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll upset him . WEEMS ( CRYING . ) I do n't see the stars . CICERO There 's clouds in that part of the sky . Look above us , Lody . ( HE LIFTS HER CHIN WITH HIS HAND . ) See the stars up there . He did n't really take the stars . No man can do that . He took the railroad station that was part Cree 's . He 's going to sell it if we do n't tell him he ca n't . ( SHE 'S QUIETER NOW . ) We 're going to help Jack and Cree. p. 26 WEEMS What do you want to do ? CICERO ( STILL CLOSE TO LODY , LOOKING AT HER . ) I want you to stand on the hill by the old chief 's with your white skirt blowing in the wind and tell him he ca n't have the depot for himself . He has to share the money from the sale of it . There are three babies he needs to think about . He 'll think you 're a spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so myself seeing you in the moonlight like this . Your eyes are wild . ( HE KISSES HER . ) WEEMS You are pressing against Baby Hare . ( CICERO SITS UP . ) It 's all right , Baby Hare . ( SHE PETS HIM . ) Do n't be afraid . No one stole Taurus , your father , from the heavens . He 's not in a corral . He 's free to roam . ( CICERO LOOKS AT HER , THEN DRIVES AGAIN . ) The red stars twinkle like Baby Hare 's eyes . ( CICERO GLANCES AT LODY AS HE DRIVES . ) It 's important that Taurus is in the sky . There would be a scar if he were gone . CICERO There will be a scar for Cree too if the depot is sold away from her . WEEMS The one Cree 's father is selling ? p. 27 CICERO Yes . ( HE LOOKS AT HER . ) Lody , you 're talking like you have some sense . ( LODY HOLDS HER RABBIT AND STARTS TO CRY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WEEMS I hear Jack and Cree fighting about it . The babies cry . I hear my mother and father fighting . CICERO About the depot ? WEEMS I do n't know . A long time ago . I close my ears and talk to Baby Hare . CICERO Jack and Cree do n't know what to do either . We can help them not to fight . We can talk to Cree 's father like a spirit in the moonlight . Pretend you 're with Taurus . Talk to the old man from the sky . WEEMS Baby Hare and I will do it . CICERO You can leave the rabbit in the car . WEEMS No . CICERO He might get upset . Think about it . WEEMS The lightning in the sky looks like the veins in Baby Hare 's ears . CICERO That 's heat lighting . Maybe a storm is on the way . We 'll have more wind to make you seem even more eerie . p. 28 WEEMS Baby Hare is afraid of storms . CICERO Then leave him in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) CICERO All right . But hold on to him . ( SHE PETS THE RABBIT WHILE CICERO DRIVES . ) You 're not afraid ? WEEMS Not with Baby Hare . CICERO Now listen , Lody . I want you to tell the old chief that Taurus will call and night will fall around him like a rock if he takes what is n't his . WEEMS But he thinks it 's his . CICERO Tell him it is n't . Tell him it 's the will of the Great Father that he share the sale of the depot with Cree . WEEMS I do n't like to speak for the Great Father . CICERO They want you to , Lody . Tell the old man that you think he should share the depot with Cree . Do you think he should share ? WEEMS Yes . CICERO Then you 'll be speaking for yourself . That wo n't be hard , will it ? WEEMS Where are we going ? p. 29 CICERO We 're turning on another road . WEEMS It 's dark . CICERO It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like baby diapers . CICERO The old chief lives down this road . WEEMS It smells like pears in the drawer . I left them once . I want  --  ( SHE DOES N'T FINISH . ) CICERO What do you want , Lody ? WEEMS I want my mother . I want to ride in a truck . CICERO Lody , the truck driver . WEEMS ( SHE LAUGHS . ) I want to ride on a train . CICERO We 're almost to the old chief 's . Do you know what to say ? ( SHUTS OFF THE CAR LIGHTS . ) WEEMS We 're still moving . CICERO I do n't want him to see the car lights . Now stay in the car while I go look in the window of the cabin . If he 's there , and drinking , I 'll come back and get you . WEEMS Now the moon is out . It 's so bright from the moon we can almost see without the car lights . p. 30 CICERO The cracks of thunder will hide the noise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . Is Taurus angry ? CICERO Do n't go off on me , Lody . Taurus is only a group of stars . WEEMS That 's not true . Taurus is the father of Baby Hare . CICERO Whatever you say , Lody . ( HE STOPS THE CAR . ) Wait here . You wo n't leave the car , will you , until I get back ? WEEMS No . CICERO Promise me . WEEMS Baby Hare and I will wait here for you . ( CICERO LEAVES . ) The moon comes from behind the clouds . Heat lightning runs across the sky . It is like the insides of Baby Hare 's long ears . Lightning behind the clouds is like white rabbit fur . I find you everywhere , Baby Hare , and Taurus , the bull . ( SHE IS QUIET FOR A MOMENT OR TWO , THEN BEGINS TO WAIL . LOWLY AT FIRST , IN HER THROAT , THEN IT GETS LOUDER . ) Taurus . Taurus . Your wife calls . CICERO ( RETURNS TO THE CAR . ) What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be quiet ! He 's asleep on the porch . He 'll hear you before it 's time . Come on , Lody . I 'll show you the small hill in front of his cabin . ( LODY GETS OUT OF THE CAR . ) Leave the rabbit here . I ca n't fool with him . p. 31 WEEMS No . CICERO You might drop him . WEEMS He goes with me . ( CICERO TRIES TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM HER AND SHE WAILS AGAIN . ) CICERO Whatever you say . ( HE TAKES HER HAND . SHE FOLLOWS HIM THROUGH THE DARK . ) Do n't fall . Hold on . Have you got Baby Hare ? WEEMS ( HOLDS TO CICERO 'S ARM . ) I have him . Be quiet , Baby Hare . He is jumping in my arms . CICERO Shhh ! You be quiet too . Climb up here to the small knoll . Here , Lody . Stand here . Now be quiet until I wake the old chief . Then say what you want . Do n't be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where he ca n't see me . I wo n't leave you . ( LODY STANDS ON THE HILL . THE MOON COMES OUT FROM BEHIND A CLOUD AND MAKES AN EERIE LIGHT ON HER . THE WIND BLOWS HER WHITE SKIRT . CICERO BEGINS TO HOWL LIKE A COYOTE . HE THROWS A ROCK AT THE CABIN . ) OLD CHIEF ( STIRS IN HIS CHAIR . ) Huh ? What  --  ( CICERO HOWLS AGAIN . LODY HOLDS THE RABBIT IN ONE ARM , RAISES THE OTHER . CICERO YELPS AND THE OLD MAN , NOW FULLY AWAKE , SEES LODY AND RISES FROM HIS CHAIR ON THE PORCH . HE KNOCKS OVER A BOTTLE AND STUMBLES OFF THE PORCH . HE STANDS IN FRONT OF THE CABIN LOOKING AT LODY. ) p. 32 CICERO ( HE MAKES ANOTHER HOWL THEN WHISPERS TO LODY . ) Now call to him , Lody . WEEMS Old chief . You have taken what does n't belong to you . I say it to you from the night and from the distant stars . Be just . You have done only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not the others involved . There is a hand that writes on the wall . You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting . ( CICERO STARES UP AT LODY . ) You could have been chief , but are not a chief . You do n't have a mind toward the people . You lived for yourself . You 've ended up with nothing and you still try and steal . OLD CHIEF Who are you ? WEEMS I am here to tell you that you have not listened to the voice within yourself . ( THE OLD CHIEF STUMBLES CLOSER TO THE HILL . ) You have known what do to , and you did n't do it . You have listened to the story of drink and your own desire . OLD CHIEF No . WEEMS What about our give-away ceremony ? A chief takes care of his people . A man 's wealth is in what he gives away . You are no chief . You would sell the depot and keep the money for yourself . p. 33 OLD CHIEF How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you  --  and the voices of them you have turned away . You follow your own tracks in a circle . You have closed yourself to truth . The voice of the night and of Taurus the bull speaks to you . CICERO That 's enough . OLD CHIEF Aha ! I know you who are . Lody Weems . The crazy girl who lives under Cree . They put you up to this . Cree would take everything , just like her mother . WEEMS Just like you , old chief , who are not a chief . OLD CHIEF Quit talking . Shut up ! WEEMS Stand up among your people and be a chief . OLD CHIEF I helped Cree move into that apartment . I saw you by the garage with that rabbit . You 're the looney who lives under Jack and Cree . ( HE JUMPS UP AND DOWN IN RELIEF . ) WEEMS And you are the rejected chief of your people .

How swift are his feet , how fierce his eyes , and the terrible snorting of his lungs . Taurus . Taurus ! I am here with Baby Hare . ( WIND RISES . THUNDER CRACKS . ) CICERO Lody . Lody . It 's not really happening . The stars are still in the sky . No one comes for you . WEEMS He 's here finally . I wo n't be alone . ( SHE WAVES TO THE SKY WITH A SWEEP OF HER ARM . CICERO REACHES UP FOR HER , AND PULLS HER DOWN . ) Let me go ! He comes for me . If he were not there , there would be a scar . CICERO Stop that , Lody . You 're out of your head .

Taken by his father to heaven . ( THE OLD CHIEF LAUGHS WILDLY . CICERO CRAWLS FRANTICALLY AROUND ON THE GROUND . ) Come back for me Taurus . Do n't leave me alone .
