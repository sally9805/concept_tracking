Breyten Breytenbach is said to be South Africa ' s finest poet in the Afrikaans language . Regrettably , " End Papers : Political Essays " ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , 256 pages , $16. 95 ) contains very little of his poetry . A random assortment of old speeches , musings , a few attractive fragmentary sketches and a good many vintage political platitudes  --  some unexceptionable , others not  --  it is a sad little book by a man who describes himself as a " burnt-out extra . " Mr. Breytenbach is a white Afrikaner who detests apartheid and has spent seven years in a South African prison . These credentials have been enough to give him a wide and uncritical audience here . But he may not be as comfortable with that as some might think . Few of those who have lionized him are familiar with his literary work , still less with the story that continues to cause him such evident anguish . He has never told it in full , and mentions it in " End Papers " only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true confession would be that . . . I desperately attempt to hide the shame of not having had the courage of my convictions in prison . . . that no amount of ' sensitive self analysis ' can obscure the fact that I can not forgive myself , or accept that others have forgiven me . " Behind these few lines is a story not just of his own human weakness , but of how cynically he has been used by harder heads than his . He himself has a poor head for politics , he admits . Once , on an especially dark day in his life , he renounced all that altogether . " It is clear to me now that my contribution can not be in the terrain of politics , and never again shall I poison myself with it , " he told a Johannesburg court in 1975 . At the time , he was committed to propositions that he has apparently backed away from since . The primal question he asks in this book about South Africa today : " Can reform still obviate revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1975 . What he was imprisoned for then was not simply political opposition to apartheid , but an active effort to train , equip and sustain an armed insurrectionary force . He was arrested soon after entering South Africa with a document called the Okhela Manifesto , drafted by his own group in Paris . It urged the African National Congress to " transform itself from a mass protest movement into an organization capable of carrying on the struggle in all its forms , particularly the armed struggle . " It also offered " logistical support . . . and the necessary training facilities " for the purpose . He had just begun to press this offer upon a small group of would-be co-conspirators when he was caught . Later , he would tell a Johannesburg court that he was wrong , " that my doings were stupid and that with which I became involved with good intentions could lead to harm for other people . " About harming others , he was assuredly right . While Mr. Breytenbach ' s proposal might enthuse parlor radicals in Paris ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects of biblical massacre for black South Africans . The overwhelming majority of them have flatly rejected armed violence for that reason , even under extreme duress . If Mr. Breytenbach no longer asks as much of his black countrymen , it might well be because he could not face the grim test himself . He confessed at his trial , not only to the nature of his plans but to the fact that , once in prison , he had offered to collaborate with South Africa ' s deadly security police . He had written directly to the chief of that force , General Geldenhuys , proposing to infiltrate the South African Communist Party in exchange for his liberty . He was obliged to read the letter out in court . Perhaps he did not expect any show of compassion from those who had urged him on . Certainly , he got none . The world-wide campaign they had mounted in his defense was called off overnight . The African National Congress consigned him to oblivion . The patron in Paris who had loved him like a son  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Solidarite "  --  promptly disowned him . He was " profoundly disappointed that Mr. Breytenbach had betrayed the cause when circumstances offered him the role every militant dreams of " ( to be a martyr , as we are told by Curiel ' s admiring biographer , Gilles Perrault . ) Of Curiel , who had not only backed him ardently in his South African venture but would have supplied the requisite weapons and training , Mr. Breytenbach wrote later : " Seldom have I met someone so single-minded and so warped by his single-mindedness . " There were " levels of confidence and there was manipulation " in Solidarite , he noted . " Some of Curiel ' s oldest friends quit it because , they say , he was using it as a vehicle to serve the Soviets . " Rehabilitated now by the same comrades-in-arms who used and discarded him a decade ago , he seems painfully aware of being used again , of " allowing myself to be drawn into valorizing actions , trying to fill the bottomless pit of deprecation and disgust.
