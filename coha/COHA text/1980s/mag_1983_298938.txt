The Manhattan gala was meant to showcase an exhibition of mountain photographs , but the stunning scenery hanging on the walls at the International Center of Photography last week was fully matched by the scenery hanging out together at the party . Robert Redford , 46 , who still turns an eye , was the host of the $250-a-head benefit . Also present were three of the camera 's best friends : Brooke Shields , 18 , Cheryl Tiegs , 36 , and Christie Brinkley , 28 . Compared with Tiegs in a floor-length chinchilla and Brinkley in black leather , Shields in a modest pattern-made dress looked like the college freshman she is . Not that the Princetonian is always averse to putting on the glitz : recently she agreed to the use of her name on a line of platinum jewelry . <P> If actors can become politicians , then why ca n't politicians become actors ? The answer is they do it all the time , but they are doing it for real on ABC 's The Crisis Game . The program is airing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After , the ABC film on the consequences of a nuclear exchange . Two weeks ago the network taped a strategic war game in which onetime officials and politicians role-play an unrehearsed version of how both sides might handle a superpower showdown . Former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie , 69 , is cast as the U.S. President . ( Muskie will have to watch the program from a hospital bed ; he suffered a heart attack at his home in Maine last week . ) Former Defense Secretaries James Schlesinger , 54 , and Clark Clifford , 76 , portray the Secretaries of Defense and State respectively . The result , says former Assistant Secretary of State Hodding Carter III , who plays a senior adviser on the program , " will be as close to reality as anything but real events themselves . " For most viewers , that should be plenty close enough . <P> It was at Treetops one day 31 years ago that then Princess Elizabeth received the news her father King George VI had died and she had acceded to the British throne . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back some day to the legendary lodge in central Kenya . Elizabeth II , 57 , fulfilled that promise last week by making the popular game-viewing spot part of a jubilant five-day state visit to Kenya . The Queen remembered her first visit well enough to note changes , commenting on the loss of trees and inspecting the ruins of the original lodge , which was burned in 1954 during the Mau Mau rebellion . After her Kenya visit , the Queen and Prince Philip went on to India , where she visited the cremation site of Mohandas K. Gandhi , the leader of yet another independence struggle that led eventually to the end of British rule .
