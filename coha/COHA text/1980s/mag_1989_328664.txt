THE GOOD TIMES by Russell Baker ; Morrow ; 351 pages ; $19.95 <P> Russell Baker has worked for laughs at the solemn New York Times ever since his " Observer " column was established in 1962 .

Or so it appears : <P> " My mother , dead now to this world but still roaming free in my mind , wakes me some mornings before daybreak . ' If there 's one thing I ca n't stand , it 's a quitter . ' I have heard her say that all my life .

The paper nurtured and rewarded his talents ; its editor was like a father . James Reston , then the Times 's Washington bureau chief , would eventually assume a similar role as Baker 's boss . But before the relationship could be established , home-office politics required that Baker pay dues in New York City . Underemployed in the Times 's vast , overstaffed city room , the " jumper , " as he describes himself , guiltily plowed through Dostoyevsky and corresponded with his wife Mimi . " The Times felt like an insurance office , " he observes . " Writing a 600-word story seemed to be considered a whole week 's work .
