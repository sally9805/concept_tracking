Before the season , both New York teams had been expected to make the National Football League playoffs . Instead , each finished with a 6-9 record and last in its division . Because of their last-place finishes , under the N.F.L. ' s scheduling formula , the teams will play each other again next season. // The Giants finished with two straight victories and three in their last four games . The Jets ended the season with four straight losses ; in the last two Decembers , their record is 0-7. // Despite the disappointment , Joe Walton will return next season as the Jets ' coach . Leon Hess , the Jets ' owner , disclosed after the game that the beleaguered Walton would not be dismissed. // Bill Parcells , whose job has never been in danger after the Giants won Super Bowl XXI last January , will be back as the Giants ' coach . His team next year will include George Martin , but not Brad Benson . Before the game , the Giants announced that the 32-year-old Benson , a starting offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34-year-old Martin , a defensive end , said that he and Parcells met last Tuesday and agreed he would play another season . <> <> An 11th by Hector // A crowd of 68 , 318 in Giants Stadium watched the Jets score late in the first quarter on a 14-yard sweep round the right end by Johnny Hector . It was Hector ' s 11th rushing touchdown of the season ; the total was the highest in the league and equaled Emerson Boozer ' s 1972 club record . The touchdown was also the Jets ' last hurrah of the day. // The Giants , who were favored , started acting the part . They scored a field goal and two touchdowns in the second quarter and a field goal early in the third quarter , and that was it . The Giants ' defense kept playing well , and the Jets ' offense , which had sputtered after an injury to Al Toon late in the first quarter , never recovered. // Toon suffered a concussion when he caught a pass and was tackled by Terry Kinard and Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following 48 minutes , the Jets gained only 140 yards . The catch was Toon ' s third of the game . He has started 35 N.F.L. games and has caught at least three passes in each of them . <> <> Giants ' Better Numbers // The final statistics confirmed the Giants ' superiority . They led by 23 to 13 in first downs , 420 yards ( a season high ) to 234 in total offense and 156 yards to 68 in rushing offense. // Joe Morris rushed 26 times for 132 yards , his highest total of the season . Mark Bavaro caught 6 passes for 109 yards , his fourth straight 100-yard game . Bavaro made his eighth touchdown catch of the season , the most by an N.F.L. tight end . The Jets ' defense left him free much of the time. // Early in the game , the lack of coverage did not seem to matter because Phil Simms , the Giants ' quarterback , failed to complete his first six passes . But he settled down , and in the second quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second. // After the Jets ' touchdown , Simms found his targets and passed the Giants to the Jets ' 12-yard line . On the third play of the second quarter , Raul Allegre kicked a 29-yard field goal , and the Giants trailed , 7-3. // The Jets then drove to the Giants ' 4 . On fourth down , Pat Leahy lined up for what apeared to be a 22-yard field-goal attempt . But the play was a fake , with Pat Ryan , the holder , called on to run to the right . Instead , Ryan ran left , thinking the Giants ' pressure was coming from the right. // When Adrian White and Mark Ingram of the Giants were about to tackle Ryan , he passed to the end zone . The ball bounced off the hands of Billy Griggs , a Jet tight end . <> <> Longest Drive of Season // The Giants took over on their 5 and moved 95 yards in their longest touchdown drive of the season . Their big play was a fake punt on fourth-and-inches from the Jets ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jumped up to take the center snap and sneaked a yard for the first down. // Eight plays later , from the 12 , Simms passed to Bavaro deep in the end zone . Bavaro got behind Troy Benson , Brad ' s younger brother , and caught the ball for a touchdown , and the Giants led , 10-7. // On the Jets ' next possession , they faced fourth-and-27 from their 30 , and Dave Jennings lined up to punt . When Zeke Mowatt of the Giants broke through the middle , Jennings ran , then threw a desperation pass that fell incomplete. // That gave the ball to the Giants on the Jets ' 25 , but the Giants got nothing because Allegre ' s 22-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide to the left . Allegre finished the day with four attempts , two successful and two wide. // With 59 seconds left in the half , the Giants got the ball back on their 40 . Two passes and one penalty put them on the Jets ' 16 . Simms then overthrew Odessa Turner in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar pass and Turner caught it for a touchdown and a 17-7 lead . <> <> Cheers For Benson // After that , the Giants were in command . In the final minute of the game , Parcells took Benson out so that the crowd could give the player one final cheer. // Parcells hugged Benson , and Harry Carson , the defensive captain and the player who doused the coach with a bucket of Gatorade after every victory last season , gave Benson the ritual bath . Carson then grabbed another Gatorade bucket and went after Parcells , but the coach danced out of the way. // Minutes later , there was another near-dousing . As Walton left the field through a tunnel near the dressing room , someone in the stands threw a container of beer at him . It landed at his feet . Last Sunday , a similar missile hit his cap. // And there was another distasteful aspect to the game . Two punching and pushing incidents erupted on the field , and Carson accused the Jets of playing " dirty football. " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson . " I think a couple of people were doing cheap shots out there. " // In one incident , Banks , the Giants ' Pro Bowl linebacker , was penalized 15 yards for punching Mickey Shuler , the Jets ' tight end. // " I got tapped on the back of the head , " said Banks . " I was returning the favor . It almost happened again the next play . I asked him if it was getting to rough out there . He didn ' t say anything. " // " He punched me , " said Shuler . " He ' s a good player , and it ' s fun for me to play against him . But I don ' t like to be punched around after a play is ended . For an All-Pro , he doesn ' t need to do that . " <> <> INJURY LIST // Kenny Hill , the Giants ' strong safety , suffered a separated left shoulder . The major Jet casualties were Toon , Kenny O ' Brien ( bruised left elbow ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s injury left his hand numb and caused him to miss one series in the fourth quarter . Ryan replaced him at quarterback for that series. //
