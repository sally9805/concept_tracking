The MBA craze that ' s swept the nation in the last two decades is forcing schools to address the same kinds of business issues they ' re preparing students to handle : How do we differentiate ourselves from the pack ? Chicago ' s business schools , which range from tiny , unaccredited programs to the top-ranked in the nation , have demonstrated that business schools , just as any other business , must carve out market niches to survive . These schools have focused on specific programs , solicited a certain level of student and touted their own selling points , whether it ' s their night-class schedule or their world-class faculty . With more than 20 master-of-business programs in the area , " Chicago clearly is one of the best examples around the country of a major metropolitan area with a lot of competition among MBA programs , " said Charles W. Hickman , director of projects and member services for the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business . The assembly is the top accreditation agency for business schools . " Chicago is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " All schools have to go through the niche-finding process . Nobody can be all things to everybody . " That lesson may have been standard fare for business students for decades , but it has been a shock to some schools . " In 1974 , there were 389 MBA programs in the country . Now there are about 700 , " he said . In the 1970s , 20 to 30 colleges and universities a year were adding MBA programs , he said . Only about a third received accreditation from the assembly-today 249 have it-but that didn ' t slow the rush of students , Hickman said . " Really , all you ' ve had to do is open the door in the last two decades , and students have rushed into it , " Hickman said . " That ' s ending now . " The number of MBA programs continues to grow , " but just barely , " Hickman said . And in the last three years , the number of MBA graduates has leveled off at about 67 , 000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students is limited , they ' ve begun to focus seriously on how to keep enrollment up . Obviously , this isn ' t a new idea at the top business schools , which always have competed for the best students . Schools watch carefully to see how they fare in national rankings . Northwestern University ' s Kellogg Graduate School of Manage-ment won top ranking in a major survey last year . Martha Craven , assistant dean and director of career counseling and placement , said the ranking contributes to pride . " It gives you name recognition , " Craven said . " It meant a lot for alums . All of a sudden it isn ' t Kellogg Who ? ' For alums trying to switch jobs , having that recognition of their degree is important to them . " But the consensus is that there ' s little difference between being No. 1 and No. 5 in terms of attracting quality students , faculty and recruiters . " I think it ' s true that , at any of the top 10 business schools , anybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roseann Hassey , assistant placement director of the Harvard Business School . But even the top schools are rethinking marketing strategy . Kellogg perhaps is best known for its marketing program . But it also has spent millions developing non-degree programs for top executives . The University of Michigan , generally considered the top public graduate business school , puts more emphasis on manufacturing than most of its peers . And , of course , being a public school means Michigan costs less than many of its private peers , another strong differentiation . Dartmouth College ' s Amos Tuck School of Business Administration also is among the top 10 . Its location in Hanover , N.H. , means it ' s not exactly convenient for recruiters , as placement director Roger F. Muller points out . But perhaps as a result , the school attracts many students who want to work for themselves , not " a large company that ' s going to be acquired or that ' s going to be downsized or restructured and you ' ll lose your job , " Muller said . Graduate schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to differentiate long ago . In Chicago , for example , De Paul and Loyola Universities focus almost exclusively on the already employed . These universities hold MBA classes only at night , with the assumption that students hold full-time jobs . Another differentiation is that , though both private , these two cost considerably less than the top-ranked U. of C. or Kellogg . Six quarters at Kellogg will cost about $30 , 000 compared with an average cost of about $15 , 000 for a degree from De Paul . So it ' s little surprise that a majority of students at De Paul and Loyola have at least part of their tuitions paid by employers . Marcus Alexis , dean of the College of Business Administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago , said having Kellogg and the U. of C. next door forced his operation to differentiate itself . " Northwestern and the University of Chicago produce for a national , maybe international , market . They attract students from a much wider geographical area . " We see ourselves as being in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to pick a single institution that we would pattern ourselves after , it would be UCLA . We see ourselves as being an urban public university , which has as its primary drawing and service area Chicago and Illinois . Maybe two-thirds are the first members of their family to ever attend college . They are more likely than the Northwestern or University of Chicago students to come from a blue-collar background , to have come from a smaller college or public university . " With that in mind , the university ' s business school has established a variety of joint programs with local employers in mind . The school has a research center for futures and options-two world industries centered in Chicago . The school has teamed with the huge medical complex nearby-University of Illinois , Cook County and Presbyterian-St . Luke ' s Hospitals-to develop a health-care management degree . There also are joint MBA programs with nursing and pharmacy , Alexis noted . MBA programs proliferated for two reasons , Hickman said . " You can ' t have a great university without a great business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At first , such programs also were " cash cows , " he said , generating far more revenue than costs . But that has begun to change . Capital costs are beginning to escalate as computer technology advances rapidly . More important , faculty costs are becoming prohibitive , he said . Roughly a quarter of all undergraduate and master ' s degrees go to business students , Hickman said . But less than 3 percent of doctoral degrees go to business students . " As a result , nationwide 15 percent of all authorized tenure track positions in business schools are vacant . There are , on average , three openings for each new Ph . D. produced by business schools . It ' s essentially a seller ' s market , " he said . " The Kelloggs and University of Chicagos of the world have to pay a lot , but they can hold their own in that market , " Hickman added . " Some of the smaller schools . . . find it more difficult . But these schools are reluctant to scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities . Hickman said he knows of only a few schools that have abandoned their master ' s programs , and they are small schools .
