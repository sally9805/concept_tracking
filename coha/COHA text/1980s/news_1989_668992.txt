Irving Park and Portage Park developed as communities for professionals seeking a quiet and refined refuge from the noise and bustle of the city . Early residents shopped at the D.D. Mee Grocery , Irving Park ' s first store . " The store sold dry goods and groceries . It was a general store , " says Bill Tyre , vice president of the Irving Park Historical Society . " The first telephone in the area was installed there in 1885 . It cost 25 cents to place a call on that phone . " The Whistle Stop Tavern , 4200 W. Irving Park Rd. , now occupies the architecturally restored building that housed the Mee ' s store . Children attended the area ' s first elementary school , the Irving Park School , 3815 N. Keeler Ave. , in the 1870s . Jefferson Township High School convened classes for the first time in 1872 in the upstairs rooms of the town hall at Six Corners where the Northwest National Bank stands today . Families of all religions attended services at the Dutch Reformed Church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodists build their church and helped other denominations open churches , " Tyre says . The Irving Park United Methodist Church , 3801 N. Keeler Ave. , and St. Viator Catholic Church , 4170 W. Addison St. , both celebrated centennials last year . Chicago annexed the two suburbs along with a ring of others in one grand sweep in 1889 . Beleaguered by shortages of water and police and fire protection , Portage Park and Irving Park were among the communities that had sought to join the city . " Irving Park faced its own unique problems , " wrote Charles Karavich , historical society president , in one of his articles that regularly appear in the society ' s monthly newsletter . " Improper drainage caused extensive flooding and the unpaved muddy streets were impassable rivers of sewage after major thunderstorms . " With annexation , the old town hall was converted to a police station . When the building was about to be torn down in 1922 , residents gathered to swap stories such as one about the community ' s famous police mascot dog Shep , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an officer every night until he died in 1905 . But annexation didn ' t change the suburban character of Irving Park and Portage Park . Both continued to develop as neighborhoods where storybook Victorian homes flanked idyllic tree-lined streets . Dr. Theodore Bacmeister , an Irving Park physician , caught the grace of the landscape in the photographs he took on glassplate negatives at the turn of the century . Two of the shots are aerials he captured by attaching his camera to a box kite . Long after annexation , residents continued to view their communities as small towns with their own clubs , stores , newspapers and traditions . Old-timers of both communities recall in particular the fun of the annual 4th of July bash , initiated in 1903 . More than 600 schoolchildren marched in the parade , which residents followed to Independence Park on Springfield Avenue . " We walked two by two , and they gave us flags to hold " in the parade , remembers Grace Herhold , 85 , who was born in Irving Park . " We got free tickets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivities included sports competition for children , teenagers , married couples and even one reserved for men weighing more than 250 pounds . Of course there were fireworks , and all the families in the two neighborhoods pitched in to pay for them . Men in the community often worked in Chicago ' s Loop and traveled there on the commuter trains . The women , many of them affluent enough to keep servants , turned to civic affairs and organized the first Irving Park Historical Society . When their irreverent husbands called the group the " Hysterical Society , " they changed the name to the Women ' s Literary Club of Irving Park and changed it again to the Irving Park Women ' s Club . That name lasted , and the group celebrates its centennial this year . Cook County owes the club and Ella Labagh , one of its early heroines , credit for helping to establish the Cook County forest preserves . The sight of lumberers cutting down trees along the Chicago River in 1901 spurred Labagh ' s efforts . She enlisted her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take photographs for lantern slide presentations . The club held meetings to gain support for preservation , and the county established a forest preserve district in 1915 as a result of these efforts . The forest preserve district named a 600-acre tract at Foster and Cicero Avenues Labagh Woods in 1940 , when Labagh was 85 . She was present to see it dedicated to her in a gala ceremony with an honor guard , city and county dignitaries and , of course , the club members . During the same years they worked to preserve the forests , the club members also taught a school they organized at the Cook County Jail . Portage Park organized its own woman ' s club 75 years ago in 1914 , and both clubs helped maintain local Red Cross centers as part of the war effort during World War I. The Portage Park Women ' s Club made an American flag on which members sewed a star for each man or youth of the community who served in the armed forces during the war . The flag flew for years above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to it , says past President Marriet Harrison , who has written a club history . The clubs and churches also hosted neighborhood concerts , plays and dances . The neighborhoods could boast of plenty of other entertainrtage Park when Addison Street was still a dusty road . They both attended St. Bartholomew ' s Elementary School , 4941 W. Patterson Ave . " Tuition was $1 a month then , " Edward Bychowski says with a laugh . He and his wife met at a church dance and lived in his parents ' house on Addison Street , where they reared nine children . They sent all of the children to school at St. Bartholomew , and now they have grandchildren in school there . The old Victorian and Queen Anne homes have a new generation of buyers interested in preserving and restoring them . Often they turn to the historical society for help . Tyre has compiled an extensive file of photographs to which renovators have referred . He and Karavich , both in their 20s , have taped interviews with dozens of elderly people who grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research to compile the essays and anecdotes that appear monthly in the historical society newslettter .
