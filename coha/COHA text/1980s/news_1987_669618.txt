' ' There are so many cases where you cover the murder of a woman and find she ' s been trying to get help , ' ' Ms. Buchanan says . ' ' The police may have been called a dozen times , but never did anything . They just patted the guy on the shoulder and said , ' Well , be nice now. ' ' ' // // Now , Buchanan notes , police officers are ' ' much more sensitive ' ' to domestic violence . They also have instructions to make an arrest if violence appears imminent. // Yet women themselves sometimes compound the problem , she adds . After an abused woman ' s husband is arrested , she might bail him out the next day , take him home , and refuse to press charges . Or a wife who has sought refuge in a shelter for battered women might sneak a call to her husband to give him the shelter ' s unpublished address. // ' ' Women in love are always so helpful , ' ' Buchanan says dryly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go back to try to make it work , and end up getting murdered. ' ' // Today she sees signs of progress . Shelters for abused women , treatment programs for abusive men , and greater public awareness of the problem help women realize they have alternatives to feeling economically and physically trapped. // ' ' It ' s getting a whole lot better , ' ' Buchanan says . ' ' But it ' s still going to take a lot of work on the part of all of us - journalists , police , women ' s groups. ' ' // Buchanan , a slim , intense woman wearing a rust-colored suit and sporting a gold ring with a diamond ' ' E , ' ' is bringing a new level of seriousness and taste to the once-sensationalistic genre of crime reporting - a beat journalists have traditionally regarded as ' ' something to get off as soon as possible. ' ' // Last year Buchanan ' s total dedication to this beat won her a Pulitzer Prize . This year she has reviewed her 16 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Corpse Had a Familiar Face ' ' ( Random House , New York , $17. 95 ) . // What leads to violence ? What can be done to prevent it ? // These simple and profound questions obviously haunt and puzzle a woman who has reported more than 5 , 000 violent deaths. // Buchanan attributes much of Miami ' s ' ' terrible violence ' ' to drugs and illegal immigration . But Americans in general have always been ' ' a sort of violent people , ' ' she insists , citing the Old West , the Revolutionary War , and the Civil War as partial evidence. // Other evidence shows up on television and in movies , which she blames for helping to ' ' cheapen life and make violence commonplace. ' ' // Even something as simple as ' ' Smoky and the Bandit ' ' movies , she said in an interview , ' ' give kids the impression that it ' s fun to outrun the police and speed down the highway . Police cars go off the cliff or into the ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are all these multiple-car pileups , but everybody walks away . There ' s no bloodshed. ' ' // Buchanan also decries the thousands of murders children see on TV . ' ' In the old days in cartoons , Bugs Bunny was always getting hit over the head or flattened , and then popping back . Everybody said cartoons were always violent . But kids knew they were cartoons. ' ' // While practical solutions - better control of borders and the nation ' s drug traffic - would certainly help , reducing violence finally calls for ' ' a basic change in the American psyche , ' ' Buchanan says. // Despite high crime rates , she emphasizes that the average prudent , law-abiding citizen faces little real danger. // ' ' Most people who get murdered take some part in their own demise , ' ' she says . ' ' They ' re doing something they shouldn ' t at the time they ' re killed . If they ' re not dealing in drugs , they ' re robbing or stealing or doing some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually retaliates with deadly force . Or they ' re fighting in traffic with a stranger who has a short temper and a loaded gun in the glove compartment , or fighting over a parking space , or brawling in bars , seeing who ' s more macho . A lot of them have drugs or alcohol aboard , or both , when it happens. ' ' // In Buchanan ' s early days on the job , policewomen were assigned to low-risk cases such as shoplifting and juvenile runaways . Now , she says , women work as homicide detectives or patrol the ghetto at midnight in patrol cars - ' ' and they ' re doing a terrific job. ' ' // Similarly , although most crime reporters are still men , Buchanan thinks women bring special talents to the field , such as ' ' a better eye for detail . And maybe we have more curiosity , and better gut feelings on occasion , or intuition . I think women in many ways are stronger than men. ' ' // Even so , she cautions young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your personal life , because major crimes don ' t usually occur 9-to-5 Monday through Friday . ' ' Describing her own personal life as ' ' very simple and quiet , ' ' Buchanan says she relaxes by listening to music , walking her dog , caring for four cats , and working on a novel. // ' ' I don ' t really take work home with me , ' ' she explains . ' ' I try to give it my best shot and work as hard as I can every day . When I go home , I know I did everything I could , and I try not to think about it anymore until the next day. ' ' // Still , there are fringe benefits . For all her contact with the dark and seamy side of Miami , Buchanan loves the city she and her mother first saw nearly 20 years ago during a two-week vacation from Paterson , N.J. , where Buchanan worked in a coat factory. // So great is her affection for her adopted home that she carries tokens of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE MIAMI , and a smooth white shell she picked up on her beloved beach . Rubbing her fingers over it , she explains : // ' ' I put this in my pocket and take it with me when I leave town . It ' s like taking Florida sand in your shoes . If you don ' t have a cat to stroke , it ' s the next best thing. ' ' // And then there are the rewards of the job itself. // ' ' It ' s a joy to write the happy-ending stories , the hero stories , ' ' she says . Her favorites involve heroes who are ' ' just average people ' ' - businessmen , housewives , truck drivers. // ' ' When people do something wonderful , you know it ' s going to be the best-read story in the paper , ' ' she says . ' ' Readers love those kinds of stories . You also give these people recognition for what they ' ve done , which is a very exciting thing to do. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can change the law , you can put people in jail , get people out of jail , you can right wrongs . Sometimes you ' re the only person who can help . Then you feel like Superwoman. ' ' // //
