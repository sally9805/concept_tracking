Somewhere out there is a man named Sam-assuming that Sam is still alive . This column is directed at him . At Bogan High School in 1970 , a freshman girl looked into her desk and found a brown spiral-bound notebook . Its brand name was Starlike Composition Book , and the cover price was 23 cents . The girl opened the notebook . Inside she found the diary of a teenage boy-a diary kept between Dec. 9 and Dec. 31 , 1964 . She didn ' t have any idea why a diary from 1964 would be in her school desk in 1970 . She knew it had to have been a class assignment-the teacher had graded it " A " at the end , and the teacher ' s comments had addressed the boy as " Sam . " The girl kept the diary . The girl is a grown woman now . She has no desire to become a public figure-she values her privacy . But she brought me the diary , knowing that I have more than a passing interest in journals kept by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing about Sam ' s diary I might be able to find him and get it back to him . " As a young girl fresh from a Catholic grammar school with separate classes for boys and girls , I never guessed that boys felt things deeply , too , " she said . " It was a real revelation for me at the time-this journey into the mind of a young man . I loved the journal and I loved its author for revealing to me the tender side of the opposite sex . " She is sure that Sam , wherever he is now , would like to have his journal returned . So I ' m going to print some of what he wrote . Maybe he ' ll see this and recognize himself. - " Love . Many a great writer has found himself tongue-tied or rather pen-tied on this subject . To some writers it is an ' electrical charge , ' to others a ' chemical reaction , ' and finally a thing beyond description . The lesser writer overestimates it . The greater writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle-wise enough to be scared of it , foolish enough to be writing on it. " - " Today I found myself angry for the first time in about two years . I was more than angry ; I was mad , just as the dogs on the street were mad so was I. My outside appearance was calm , for I have learned to control that if not my temper . I began to breathe deeply and my teeth began to itch from the inside ( with me that ' s my safety valve ) . I was no longer a boy , no longer a man , this anger had distorted my thinking . I was soon ready to take on the whole room . I thank heaven no one challenged me for their sake . The one whom I was angry with soon left the room but that night I had heard my echo , I had seen my shadow. " - " Girls . I find the 15-year-old girl not too different from the 10- year-old boy . In the vocabulary of the 10-year-old boy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words for their pure shock value . I have the feeling that 15-year-old girls are doing the same thing with sex . They wear their tightest , shortest , and sexiest dress . They dance close-in fact if they danced any closer they would be behind me . I am not complaining ( I am normal ) ( I hope ) , it is just while dancing she tells you how superior she is to you. " - " Life . I will sleep one-third of my life away , I will work one-third of my life away , and I shall waste one-third of my life away . It is my job to succeed in at least one of these . If I sleep , sleep long and deep . If I work , work hard and fast . And if I waste , waste completely and save nothing . There are many formulas for success , most written by failures. " - " There is no question of not being . The question is , of being what ? To be ' rich , ' poor , weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ! I could become a plumber , electrician , or milkman . A plumber ? I hate water . An electrician ? I can ' t take four years ' apprenticeship . A milkman ? Who can get up ? To go to college ? Maybe both . I could go to night school . I wouldn ' t want to waste my college , so in my spare time I could write a book . I can see it now . . . a hit , best seller , and I ' m a millionaire . I make two million and quit , put it in a bank and live off the interest. " - " Me-the one person I know best , not completely , just better than the next guy . Who is this ' me , ' a reflection in the mirror ? Whose mirror ? In the mirror of me ' s mind he sees a strong , brave , handsome man who walks tall in the sun . It could be that me ' s mirror is a little cracked . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunken and misformed . Who is he to believe the me I thought I knew so well I find out knows himself least of all . " And the last entry in the journal-the entry from Dec. 31 , 1964 : - " The old year is gone , it is history . I am history . Me-I am history as much as the governors , mayors , kings and queens . History is the past , the lessons taught to us by yesterday . " You have to wonder : What happened to Sam ? Did his life turn out to be as filled with introspection and self-awareness as his writings seemed to portend ? Or did the wonder and questioning in his voice go away-did the man leave the boy behind ? We may never know . But if Sam is out there , 24 years later-the diary of the boy you used to be is here , waiting for you.
