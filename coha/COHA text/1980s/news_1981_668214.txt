Setting its own price for a loan to rescue the city ' s schools , the Boston City Council yesterday authorized the White administration to borrow $75 million if the mayor accepts unprecedented limitations on his fiscal powers . Aides predicted privately that Mayor Kevin H. White would reject the loan authorization because of those restrictions . By law , the council can not override a rejection of the measure by the mayor . With the schools due to close for lack of money next Thursday , the council is likely to face growing pressure next week to modify its positions on the issues of financing and mayoral power - issues it wrestled with for 20 hours this week . On a voice vote following three days of deliberations , the council approved and sent to White a plan to borrow the $75 million - of which $38 million would go to the schools and $37 million would pay court-ordered property tax refunds . The council , at the same time , approved seven new proposals for raising money , along with a series of measures that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial affairs . " I really don ' t care whether it ' s acceptable to the mayor , " remarked Councilman Joseph Tierney , whose committee wrote many of the proposed changes in the City Charter that were approved yesterday . To obtain the loan he needs , Tierney said , White " is going to have to accept some controls " on his authority . " I think it was too bad when once or twice we declared war on the mayor , " commented Councilman John Sears . " I don ' t think there ' s much sense in sending him something he manifestly can ' t accept . " The measures approved by the council yesterday included these : BULLET The position of city auditor , who is appointed by the mayor , would be abolished . In the auditor ' s place , the council would chose a comptroller independent of the mayor . BULLET The council and mayor would gain the right to pass a law allowing voters to recall any elected Boston official . BULLET The Boston Finance Commission , a state-appointed agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have final approval of personal service contracts . These no-bid contracts have been used by the administration to hire firms and employees outside the Civil Service system . BULLET The authority of the school superintendent would be enhanced significantly , with new powers over personnel and school spending . The superintendent would also be able to appoint or remove virtually all school employees , a power that official does not have now . BULLET The council would gain the power to approve transfers of funds between departments after June 10 of each fiscal year . Currently the mayor alone has that authority and has used it to transfer funds from accounts with surpluses to those with deficits . BULLET All city departments , including schools , would receive quarterly budgetary allotments instead of annual appropriations , the current practice . To over spend an allotment in any three-month period , a city department would need the approval of the mayor and the council . n98 take2of2 The administration ' s official response to those measures came from a spokesman , Michael Donovan , who said in a prepared statement : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the review is completed . " Unofficially , there was unanimity among White ' s aides that the entire collection of proposals was doomed . " You ' ve heard the phrase " Don ' t touch it with a 10-foot pole , " ' remarked one official . " Do you know where we can get an 11-foot pole ? " Besides Whited the council . ' s approval , the proposals also need the sanction of the state Legislature and Gov . Edward J. King . That makes enactment by Thursday , the day the schools are due to run out of money , questionable . Moreover , some persons knowledgeable about the city ' s finances wondered whether the council ' s proposals would achieve their central purpose : creation of enough new revenue sources and strong enough constraints on school spending to make city bonds attractive investments . Some said the constraints d the council . were not stringent enough . Councilman Lawrence DiCara , whose own series of proposals was largely defeated by his colleagues , commented , " We did not deal significantly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would invest in the city that we will not be back here next year . " Samuel Tyler , an official of the business-funded Boston Municipal Research Bureau , found fault with the provisions allowing recalls and shifting to a council-named comptroller . He also said hd the council . e considered it a " very poor financial practice " to earmark funds from the loan to pay the operating expenses of the school system . Investment bankers , Tyler said , shy away from municipal loans that are not to be used for extraordinary expenses such as major building projects . Under the administration ' s proposal , $90 million would be borrowed to fund the tax abatement obligation , while money already set aside for that purpose in the city ' s budget would be used for the schools . Under the ld the council . can authorization approved yesterday , the city would borrow $75 million and repay the money over a period up to 10 years . Assuming the money was loaned at an 11 percent interest rate for that duration , the city ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due the first year would be $15.8 million , but that obligation would diminish progressively until the city owed $8.3 million in the 10th year . With Proposition 2 curtailing the city ' s ability to raise money from property taxed the council . s , the council Thursday approved seven proposed new taxes and charges . They would be used to repay the borrowed money and help offset the money lost to Proposition 2 . The new taxes and charges could include : a levy against tax- exempt property , taxes on hotel and motel room payments , private parking garages , condominium conversions and cable television revenues and the retrieval of parking ticket revenue now going to the state . Those new sources could produce more than $55 million annually , d t B07916905
