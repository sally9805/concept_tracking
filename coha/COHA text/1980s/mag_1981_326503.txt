A splendid Prince , his beautiful Princess , a carriage , a crowd : fantasy come to life , a dream riding in stately progress through London . Except that this moment and the ones that came before and after were real , for all to observe . The millions upon millions everywhere who chose to do so discovered that seeing is believing . From the fireworks that etched the sky on the evening before last week 's royal wedding to the tumultuous departure from a train station the next afternoon , a ceremonial vision was stunningly conveyed through a pageant of colors and forms . The old seemed polished by happiness and the new burnished by tradition . <P> Breastplates glistened and the flanks of superbly groomed horses shone in the morning sunlight .

The couple at the center of all this attention performed impeccably , as everyone expected ; but equally impressive were the thousands who worked in the background : these ranged from bobbies and choirboys to the Queen herself , who took an unaccustomed supporting role in the triumphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following pages show , all the effort was worth it . An ancient community affirmed its future .
