Vance travels to head off criticism of U.S. policy <P> The trip had been so hastily put together that there was not even a firm itinerary on the day of departure . But for Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , organizing a precise travel schedule was the least of his worries . With the Western alliance in disarray over its response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , Vance shuttled his way through four European capitals last week in an attempt to win support for the activist U.S. position . <P> The whirlwind tour had become urgently necessary in the wake of the French refusal to take part in a five-nation parley with the U.S. , originally scheduled for last week in Bonn . Deeply concerned about French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing 's coolness to U.S. diplomatic initiatives , Washington decided that even a series of bilateral talks would do more to restore a sense of cohesion within the Western alliance than no consultations at all . " There is no substitute for face to face , " said one senior U.S. official on the trip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting across a table . " <P> At each meeting , in his lawyer-like fashion , Vance unfurled a detailed brief urging Europe to support the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics and its embargo of grain and high technology sales to the Soviet Union . Vance also called for a beefing-up of NATO and increased European military aid to Pakistan and Turkey . Above all , he preached unity , warning that the Kremlin must not be allowed to drive a wedge between the allies . <P> In Bonn the Secretary had to mollify some outspoken critics of U.S. moves in the post-Afghanistan era . Certain West German officials had privately derided Carter 's Olympic boycott as " downright dumb . " Chancellor Helmut Schmidt resented not being consulted in advance about this decision . A bare two hours ' notice on the day of its announcement , he observed unsmilingly , was " a little late . " The West Germans also feared serious setbacks to their international trade if they followed Carter 's proscriptions on commercial dealings with Moscow . <P> Schmidt cordially received Vance at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but obvious U.S.-West German differences remained . While Vance stressed at a press conference that the Soviets " must pay the cost flowing from the blatant invasion of a neighboring country , " Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher took a very different tack . Said he : " We must do everything we can to avoid escalation , make a political solution of the problem possible , and pursue dtente . " <P> Vance 's pitch got a more sympathetic hearing in London , where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has consistently endorsed Carter 's tough stance on Afghanistan . Shortly after meeting with Vance , British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington called on his fellow Europeans to unite in supporting the U.S. Said he : " There is no country in the European Community which does n't know that the alliance with America is the bedrock of Europe 's security . When the chips are down , we are all firmly on the side of the only superpower we have . "
