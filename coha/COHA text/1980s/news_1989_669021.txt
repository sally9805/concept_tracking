The European auto industry , fearing it will be " ruined " by Japan ' s carmakers after a single European market is created in 1992 , is asking the Japanese to limit exports voluntarily throughout at least half of the next decade . However , Japan won ' t be easily convinced , analysts predict . The American auto industry obtained voluntary export quotas from Japan in the early 1980s during Detroit ' s severe downturn and restructuring . But the European industry is reporting record profits , running at nearly full capacity and enjoying much wider access to the Japanese market . The call for voluntary restraint adds another dimension to the debate in Europe over how to ensure the health of its auto industry-the Continent ' s single most important sector , employing , directly and indirectly , an estimated 20 million people-while holding to a commitment to remove internal trade barriers to create a single European market . That debate also involves the complex and interwoven political issues of dismantling national quotas on Japanese cars , whether to impose local-content rules on Japanese auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going far enough to open their market to European auto manufacturers . The European Commission , which has let these questions simmer in the last few years , is working overtime to develop a coherent position , and is expected to issue a policy statement in the coming weeks , before an expected June visit from Japan ' s all-powerful Ministry of Trade and Industry . Policymakers in Brussels , seat of the European Common Market , appear to favor voluntary restraints as a way to protect the European industry through a transition period in which quotas on Japanese imports in France , Italy , Britain and Spain are to be eliminated as part of the 1992 single-market project . " There is a link between unilateral monitoring of exports on the Japanese side and the dismantlement of national restrictions , " said Paul Weissenberg , a Common Market policymaker . The call for a " gentlemen ' s agreement " by Japanese car exporters was first voiced last month at a world auto industry forum in Paris . At that gathering , Umberto Agnelli , a top executive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European industry ' s lobbying group , asked for a " transition period of five to seven years " in which Japanese manufacturers " move from an attitude of conquest to one of cooperation . " " I think it would be good if non-European competitors weren ' t to force our hand , " Agnelli said , warning that such aggressive actions would lead to " self-defense measures at the national levels , and then Europe would be backtracking . " Raymond Levy , chairman of France ' s Regie Renault , said a transition period was necessary " to prevent an invasion of Japanese cars from ruining Europe ' s car industry . " General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. , both with manufacturing operations in Europe , echoed the call . " We all agree in fierce competition , but we must minimize the dislocation on society that will occur ( in the absence of export limits ) , " said Robert J. Eaton , president of General Motors Europe . Satoshi Okubo , chairman of Honda Motor Co. and vice chairman of the Japan Auto Manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character of fairness and it must be reasonable . " But what is " fair " and " reasonable " to the Japanese may not be that to the European industry , which wants Japanese exports to the Common Market cut back to 1987 levels , and then frozen . In that year , Japan exported 1. 05 million cars and light trucks to Europe and captured 9. 5 percent of an 11 million-vehicle market . Since then , Japan ' s slice of the pie hasn ' t changed much , but its exports have grown with the booming European market , reaching 1. 21 million units in 1988 . This year , Japan expects to increase that level again by 2. 5 percent , to 1. 25 million vehicles . " We are not happy with this figure , " said Francois Perrin-Pelletier , managing director of the European industry ' s lobbying group . However , the European industry is not in a good bargaining position , analysts say . " The power has moved back to Japan ' s side of the table , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . " Europe could be on thin ground if it appears too insistent because Japan could call its bluff . " A forced " voluntary " quota , he said , could put Europe in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Lawson speculated that Europe may ultimately have to settle for voluntary restraints that would permit Japan to increase its exports to 11 to 12 percent of the market , or up to 1. 42 million units a year . Weakening the Common Market ' s negotiating position is the current robust health of the European industry . In 1988 , the seven mass-market European manufacturers-Ford , GM , Renault , Fiat , Rover Group , Peugeot S.A. and Volkswagen AG-achieved combined net earnings of $8. 88 billion , a 43 percent gain from 1987 . What ' s more , long waits are common for a host of popular models in Europe , such as the Fiat Tipo or the GM-Opel Vectra , and European producers are adding capacity to meet the demand . Up to now , the Europeans have claimed that the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market would aggravate the situation , hurting profits and ultimately workers in Europe . " Everyone ' s fears are based on the realization that the current market won ' t last , and that when the market falls , the Japanese imports will increase pressure on the capacity situation , " Lawson said . " There ' s a narrow band between a 10-week waiting list and having to give away a free TV with every car . " CAPTION : GRAPHIC : Japanese car sales in Europe. 1988 market share .
