After his plane touched down at Denver 's Stapleton airport last month , Skier Jeff Blumenfeld hurried to the Avis desk and signed up for a rental car at the daily fee of $44 . It seemed like an attractive price ; for his four-day trip , the New York City executive figured he would pay around $180 . But Blumenfeld 's final bill came to a more daunting $253.30 . Says he : " You go to a rental-car agency , and you do n't know what it 's going to cost you . They nickel and dime you to death . " <P> Many travelers would agree . Increasingly high fees for coverage against damage , theft and other hazards can more than double the price of a car rental . A recent Hertz special , advertised at $99 for seven days , would actually cost $230.95 for full protection . Consumer advocates argue that many motorists do not need such coverage . " Car-rental companies try to intimidate customers into buying this insurance , " says Robert Hunter , president of the National Insurance Consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most controversial and expensive coverage is the collision damage waiver , which generally absolves renters of repair costs for accidental damage to the car . Until last year , customers were liable up to a ceiling of $3,000 , but rental agencies have now started holding customers responsible for the total value of the auto . Though an estimated 60% of insured motorists are already covered for this by the insurance on their personal autos , many are unaware of it . Moreover , some credit-card issuers have started providing coverage if the rental is charged on their card . Even so , many renters pay as much as $11.95 a day for the C.D.W. Since insurance companies charge the equivalent of $1.30 a day for comparable coverage , rental-car companies are overcharging U.S. consumers up to $2 billion annually on C.D.W.s alone , according to David Cohen , a Massachusetts state legislator . Rental-agency executives claim otherwise . " Waivers do not make any profit for us , " says Henry Caruso , president of Dollar Rent A Car . <P> While many state insurance regulators are eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Reason : courts have ruled that the rental-agency coverage for collision , injury and property losses is not a form of insurance in the traditional sense . But states are beginning to enact laws to restrict the industry 's questionable sales practices . And last May , Minnesota passed a law that required all auto insurance sold in the state to cover the owner for rental-car use . <P> The renters who can really get taken for a ride are those with no insurance and no C.D.W. , who are often overcharged for repairs . Last month Hertz , the No. 1 U.S. car-rental firm , disclosed that it had duped consumers and insurance companies to the tune of about $13 million in inflated repair bills . While Hertz is paying the money back , two other rental agencies , Avis and Budget , acknowledge that they sometimes charge customers more for repairs than the companies actually pay . One good reason , the rental agencies contend , is that accidents cost them lost rental time .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
