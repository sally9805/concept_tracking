Miniature stereo tape players tune up a silent revolution <P> Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins <P> Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own . <P> - T.S . Eliot <P> The symptoms : eyes focused in the middle distance , a smile as wide as a convert 's and a telltale glint of metal covering the ears . The body may undulate with faint intimations of a boogie . Sometimes the hands fly upward in imaginary conducting motions . No doubt about it , it is an epidemic , brought on by America 's mania not only for music , but for the gadgetry on which to play it . On streets , in parks , on bikes and buses , the latest transistor toy is the portable stereo cassette player . Weighing less than a pound and smaller than a paperback book , it has feather-light earphones that transmit sound of concert-hall clarity directly to the brain of the wearer , without bothering anyone near by . As Detroit Audio Salesman Thomas Badoud puts it , " These babies are unreal ! " <P> Unreal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisbeeing while learning French , skiing to Shostakovich and jogging to Jagger . The thin wires of the headsets uncoil from Brooks Brothers blazers and Gucci bags , as well as from bib overalls and warmup suits . Commuters , pitchers in bull pens , shoppers hovering over the meat counter and sunbathers soaking up rays are tuning in by the millions . In Houston , prospective buyers of the Sony Walkman , the original device that touched off the craze last year , must sign up for at least a 60-day wait at major audio outlets . In the Boston area , the waiting period can be up to 30 days , and some dealers require the full locally discounted price of $170 to reserve the mini-Mozart machine . Says Harvard Square 's Tech Hi-Fi Sound Consultant Douglas Corley : " Our sales depend only on how fast they can build them . " Some 30 other manufacturers have rushed more than 50 competing models onto the market , ranging from $60 to $300 . Some units , like the KLH Solo and Toshiba KT-52 , have FM stereo radios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphones for direct recording and AC adapters . Sony , which devotes an entire Tokyo factory to the units ' production , this year expects to double its 1980 U.S. sales of a million of them . <P> Invented by Sony Chairman and Co-Founder Akio Morita because he wanted to be able to listen to high fidelity music while playing tennis , the sets allow the novelty of taking one 's favorite music where it could never go before . Said Los Angeles Carpenter Howard Bogaz , 25 , while roller-skating on the colorful Venice , Calif. , strand : " I use it while I 'm working , I take it when I ski or on long drives . I 'm into my music ! The sun is out , the wind is blowing , and you 're on your wheels ! " <P> But rolling along with the sounds is also a form of aural self-defense for some , such as New York TV Producer Anthony Payne , 34 . " There are buses , airplanes , sirens , " says Payne . " You have to replace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ears . " Manhattan Computer Executive Michael Starr , 43 , suggests that the private concert " is a great way of snubbing the world . Can you imagine if Philip Roth had had one growing up ? He 'd never have written Portnoy 's Complaint . He never would have heard the nagging . "
