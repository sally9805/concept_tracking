" It ' s a divisional game , " said Mora , the Saints ' coach , " and to win the division you have to beat divisional opponents. " // Well , that helps . But New Orleans has played only two teams from the National Conference West , losing to the 49ers and beating the Falcons . The fact is that the first-place Saints , with a 7-1 record , have been faring well against nearly everyone . They have won 7 straight games , 16 of their last 18 and are 26-14 since Mora became head coach in 1986 . Before that , the Saints were 5-11 in 1985 and 7-9 in 1984 . With a victory Sunday over the Rams , who are 6-2 , Mora can tie Bum Phillips for the most victories by a Saints head coach. // The Saints like their chances . The Rams have lost their last three games in the Superdome , including one during the strike last year , and they scored one touchdown in those losses . New Orleans has a rugged defense that has produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quarterback. // Hebert has completed 62. 4 percent of his passes for 12 touchdowns and has had six passes intercepted . In a season in which many quarterbacks have fallen to injury , Hebert has remained healthy . No other Saint has thrown a pass except for Lonzell Hill , a receiver. // Complementing Hebert is the rookie running back , Craig ( Ironhead ) Heyward , whose 73-yard touchdown run last Sunday against the Los Angeles Raiders is the National Football League ' s longest this season . <> <> Local Teams // Pittsburgh ( 2-6 ) at Jets ( 4-3-1 ) , Channel 4 , 1 P.M. - If the Jets can be shredded for 521 yards of passing offense , allow 30 points and still win against the Miami Dolphins , then Pittsburgh is in trouble. // Bubby Brister , the Steeler quarterback who has missed three games because of a finger injury , is back to replace Todd Blackledge . Blackledge completed 9 of 17 passes for 129 yards in Pittsburgh ' s 39-21 victory last week over the Denver Broncos. // Giants ( 5-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 P.M. - A rematch of a game the Lions led early and the Giants controlled late and won , 30-10 , two Sundays ago. // This time , Rusty Hilger starts at quarterback for the Lions , who are hurting with the No. 1 quarterback , Chuck Long , injured as well as Bennie Blades , a safety , and James Jones , a fullback . That won ' t help a Detroit running game that ranks 14th in the conference or a defense that is 5th against the pass . <> <> National Conference // Minnesota ( 5-3 ) at San Francisco ( 5-3 ) - The last time they met , in the playoffs last year , Minnesota shocked San Francisco and finished a victory from the Super Bowl . This time they play in the same place - Candlestick Park - both two games behind in their divisional races. // Featured are a pair of football ' s most elusive and exciting receivers , the 49ers ' Jerry Rice ( 33 catches , five touchdowns , 22. 4 yards per catch ) and the Vikings ' Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards per catch ) . // Phoenix ( 4-4 ) at Dallas ( 2-6 ) - Coach Tom Landry is under fire in Dallas after a miserable start and his failure to keep track of the line of scrimmage late in Sunday ' s loss to the Eagles . Phoenix lost the first meeting , which was their home opener in Tempe , Ariz. , and needs this one to keep pace in the tight East race. // Atlanta ( 1-7 ) at Philadelphia ( 4-4 ) - The Eagles have to be happy with a . 500 record after playing the Bengals , the Redskins , the Vikings , the Oilers , the Giants and the Browns . If there was ever a break in Philadelphia ' s schedule , this is it . <> <> American Conference // Cincinnati ( 7-1 ) at Cleveland ( 5-3 ) - This battle of Ohio and for the spoils in the Central Division is always testy . Cincinnati won the first one this season , but Bernie Kosar did not play . Kosar starts this time , but Cleveland has to be concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team ' s league-leading 236 points. // San Diego ( 2-6 ) at Seattle ( 4-4 ) - Seattle was manhandled in an embarrassing 31-10 loss to the Rams last week . When Chuck Knox , the Seattle coach , said after the Seahawks ' 2-0 start ( which included a rare season-opening victory at Denver ) that two victories did not make a season , he wasn ' t kidding . San Diego is tied with Kansas City for the conference low in points scored ( 102 ) and has allowed 169. // Kansas City ( 1-6-1 ) at Los Angeles Raiders ( 3-5 ) - Steve Beuerlein replaces Jay Schroeder but the Raiders want to change their losing ways more than their quarterbacks . A quarterback change won ' t much help a defense that has been burned for 25. 8 points a game ( 45 in a loss to Cincinnati ) . The Chiefs are bickering among themselves and have not won in five games . <> <> Interconference // Chicago ( 7-1 ) at New England ( 3-5 ) - Doug Flutie might have andgdge because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was with Chicago , but it ' s a slim one at best . New England is not as powerful offensively as San Francisco , and Flutie must hope Chicago ' s No. 1-ranked defense has a mental or physical letdown after a rousing Monday-night showing against the 49ers . That , however , is not likely . Washington ( 5-3 ) at Houston ( 5-3 ) - The first Sunday-night game of the year is an excellent matchup between teams capable of executing offensively and defensively with precision. // Jerry Glanville , the Houston coach , said , " Ten wins will get a team into the playoffs and we will be one of those teams . " Glanville stopped short of predicting that 1 of those 10 victories would come against the defending Super Bowl champions . Doug Williams returned last week as the Washington quarterback job after being sidelined four weeks because of an appendectomy. // Green Bay ( 2-6 ) at Buffalo ( 7-1 ) - Buffalo takes a peek at the improved Packers . Defense has boosted the Packers from their 0-5 start ; they rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tampa Bay ( 2-6 ) - Dan Marino must wonder what else he can do after passing for the second-highest yardage total in a game in National Football League history in a losing effort . A repeat performance probably won ' t be necessary against a defense that has been outrushed by nearly 2-1 in attempts and outgained on the ground , 870 yards to 726 . <> <> Monday Night // Denver ( 4-4 ) at Indianapolis ( 3-5 ) , Channel 7 , 9 P.M. - The Colts finally seem to be turning the corner , and the Bronco receivers welcome back John Elway with open arms . Both teams have played adequately on defense but their offenses haven ' t been up to par . Thus , of course , on Halloween night , expect a high-scoring finish. //
