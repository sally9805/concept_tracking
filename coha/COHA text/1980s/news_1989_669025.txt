The Du Page County Board ' s Health Committee voted Monday in favor of seeking a state permit to add 100 beds to the county ' s convalescent center . The expansion to 508 beds from 408 is planned to serve patients younger than 65 whose needs for space and rehabilitative facilities are greater than those of most of the patients now in the facility at 400 N. County Farm Rd . , Wheaton , according to Ronald Reinecke , director of the convalescent center . The committee recommended that the County Board permit the convalescent center staff to apply to the state for a certificate of need for the proposed expansion .

Many are elderly people who are capable of living at home but have placed themselves on the waiting list in anticipation of some future need , he said . " About 30 to 40 have some crucial immediate need to be housed somewhere in a nursing home . . . .
