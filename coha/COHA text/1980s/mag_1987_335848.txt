It was delightful and painful to see your coverage of the Tibetan Guru Chogyam Trungpa , Rinpoche , whose body was cremated in Vermont ( ( AMERICAN SCENE , June 22 ) ) . The story was delightful because , laced as it was with cynicism , it was the kind of article Rinpoche would have enjoyed and appreciated . On the other hand , the coverage was painful because so many of us who are his followers apparently came off as self-absorbed and condescending . We know that we are not free of such attitudes , but they certainly are not our aim . <P> Mark and Rebecca Hazell <P> Oakland <P> We Americans appear to be turning into gullible fools when we give religious allegiance to so-called spiritual leaders who are promiscuous and abuse alcohol . It does not take a theological student to realize that these $ flagrantly wealthy , sex-ridden , fast-living " holy men " are not the real thing . <P> Perry de la Torre <P> Modesto , Calif.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
