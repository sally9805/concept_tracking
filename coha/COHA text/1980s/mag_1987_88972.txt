Occasionally I regret that I did n't start playing soccer earlier in life . Compared to the darker clouds of lost youth , it 's a small regret , but it nags me with surprising regularity . The larger if only 's are usually accompanied by the but then 's that temper regret with an awareness of other opportunities . But it does n't work that way with me and soccer . // I remember how , as a child in England , I would cling to my father 's hand as we pushed through crowds of shouting soccer fans to get as close to the action as possible . At games , my father , a proper Englishman , would try to suppress his excitement , which manifested itself in contorted jerks of his body and bursting grunts of frustration at bad passes or missed goals . Being an even more proper little English girl , I would sit quietly , pink-ribboned and lace-frocked , watching attentively while the crowd roared and my father muttered . // During the following 25 years , my father organized several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . My four younger brothers played in some of them . In true British big-sister tradition , I would go to their games and watch . It never occurred to me to be anything but a spectator , and as each of my brothers developed into a star , I stood on the sidelines with all the other sisters . // As I look back over my rocky relationship with soccer , I am aware mainly of duplicity . I grew up with the sport but did n't kick a soccer ball until I was 30 . And when I did , I discovered that soccer is simple only until you play it . Then it becomes an ongoing test of the mind , body and spirit . // Why at age 30 ? Why not before ? Why at all ? These are questions without answers . Like everything important in my life , playing soccer careened against my intellect . In my 20 's I was affected by the women 's movement as it was heralded by Simone de Beauvoir 's The Second Sex and Germaine Greer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some people , did not espouse athleticism . Women were more evolved than men . Sports were adolescent . Athleticism was something to be eliminated , not emulated . Women had more important things to do  --  like take on the world , and fix it . During the apex of this all-consuming search for personal and political liberation , my father was helping Seattle 's first women 's soccer teams get organized . That disgusted me. // But a short time later , during an evening of debauchery in 1974 , soccer and I collided . I had been drinking beer for hours with friends in a raunchy Seattle tavern . We were waiting for my brother Roger , who was then a member of the city 's professional soccer team , the Sounders of the North American Soccer League . It was Roger 's birthday and he was late . " Where the hell you been ? " I slurred to his girlfriend , Barbara , when they finally arrived . // She gave a scathing account of the team dinner they had just left . The adoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes had been an insult to her sense of feminist values and a good excuse to get drunk . Soon Barbara and I were sharing a vehement exchange about the ego needs of men in sports . How childish . How farcical . Such dangerous illusions in which to wrap one 's identity . How we progressed from general insult of the male character to the grand announcement that we would start our own soccer team is a mystery . I ca n't believe that we actually followed up on that booze-inspired decision . // It was n't easy . Learning your first sport when you 're old enough to think about what you are doing is one of life 's more perverse challenges . The mind believes it should be able to make the body do whatever it wants . Ha . It was at least three years before I stopped having paralyzing attacks of adolescent embarrassment about my clumsiness on the soccer field . Another three years before I began to experience the wisdom of the body . And at least another couple of years before I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . // My current concern is how to educate the men I play with about the finer details of teamwork . As a left wing on my women 's team , I enjoy an active relationship with both ball and players . On my coed team , which has six men and five women , I can more often be found gazing over the horizon in private reverie , waiting for a ball to loop my way . The guys just do n't seem to get it . // I suppose I could throw myself into the tangle of legs and elbows in the middle of the field instead of playing my position , but I look forward to playing into my 60 's . Proving my self-destructive prowess at age 42 wo n't get me there . I do get angry . But when you 're a woman you do n't punch the bastards out ; they think you 're whining . // Yet for all my frustration , soccer affords me my purest moments of liberation and reflection . Perhaps it 's because I did n't start playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport was so damn hard , so unnatural and so humiliating . Anyway , if I had gotten my first hat trick at 14 , I would n't have felt so privileged to get it at 41 . Life does n't get much sweeter than a hat trick at 41. // On that particular night I came to the field with a slight ambivalence . I am a playwright , and I had made plans to go to the theater that evening , but when I made that commitment I had forgotten I had a soccer game . Explaining to my friends why I could n't attend the play was interesting , especially because the field and theatre were across the street from each other . The thought of my colleagues gazing over in bemusement at intermission was not pleasant . Maybe they would n't recognize me . It was a drizzly night , the lights were dim , and I look different in soccer clothes  --  a little chubby and uncamouflaged by the trappings of daily life . Besides , although I told them what I was doing , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For more than 10 years I have played soccer on women 's teams , men 's teams , mixed teams , young teams , old teams , good teams , bad teams , teams with matching uniforms and teams that would rather lose than have matching uniforms . Only the sport remains the same . Bringing the ball under control and making a crisp pass to a teammate require both autonomy and dependence . In his 1945 book The Unquiet Grave : A World Cycle , Cyril Connolly writes , " I believe in two-faced truth , in the Either , the Or and the Holy Both . " It 's the only phrase I 've ever memorized , and the soccer field is the only place I 've ever truly realized it . // Control of a soccer ball is paradoxical . If we try to barricade the ball , it will just bounce away . By yielding to it , we can take control . In a game when the play is ripe with give and take , the ball becomes almost animate , moving with its own delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . // We try our best , even though we disagree about whether we should play to win or to play all the players . If we play to win  --  and win  --  who sits on the sidelines ? If we play to play  --  and lose  --  who goes home sulking like a disappointed five-year-old at Christmas ? It gets complicated . Some games are worth losing . Some are n't worth winning . // Even a well-played victory with no subs on the sideline inevitably draws complaints . Why ca n't she get to the ball a little faster ? Why wo n't he pass to a woman ? Why does n't anyone want to play goalie ? Who 's baby-sitting the kids ? Why is the referee blind ? // Though the gripes are predictable , the game is as unpredictable as the weather in which it is played . When I scored my hat trick , the night was cold and rainy . My first goal was an instinctive , one-touch response to a beautifully passed ball . The other two I do n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and the smell of salt water blowing up from Puget Sound ; the theater crowd in the distance , huddled with coffee and cigarettes at intermission ; and the feeling that life still holds surprises . I felt that , at 41 , perhaps my life had just begun , and that the best things in life are not only free but also unexpected .
