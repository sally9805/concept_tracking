Shortly after 1 A.M. yesterday , Righetti again was a minor league player , struggling to hold back tears as clubhouse helpers packed his bags for an unexpected trip. // Righetti was sent to Columbus , the Yankee farm team in the International League , at the direction of George Steinbrenner , the Yankee principal owner , to work with Sammy Ellis , the pitching coach there , and improve a record considered unsatisfactory by Steinbrenner. // When reached by telephone last night in Manhattan , Righetti said he had no hint the demotion was coming . " Earlier , I was terrible , " he said . " I might have thought about something then . Since then , I dropped my e. r. a. 100 points , I was third in the league in strikeouts , the American League was only hitting . 210 against me , or . 212 . I thought I was going the right way. " // Sparky Lyle , the former Yankee relief pitcher , had once gone from Cy Young to sayonara , as his teammate , Graig Nettles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 . But the trade of Lyle , which brought Righetti to the Yankee organization in 1978 , was not the surprise that Righetti faced just after the Yankees ' 17-inning 4-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians that ended at 1 : 08 A.M. yesterday . <> <> Travel on Borrowed Money // Righetti was then summoned to the executive offices upstairs in Yankee Stadium where Bill Bergesch , the club ' s vice president of baseball operations , told him of Steinbrenner ' s decision . Righetti talked quietly to a few remaining teammates ; borrowed some money from Pete Sheehy , the clubhouse attendant , waved reporters away as his bags were packed and left within 45 minutes. // " I didn ' t know what to think , " Righetti said about his trip to see Bergesch . " I didn ' t think I was going down , but I ' m not naive , either. " // " I ' ll say this , " Bergesch said yesterday afternoon , " he was sad . " Righetti ' s record is 5-5 with an earned run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five is O.K. , " Steinbrenner said yesterday afternoon . " But I can ' t have five and five from Righetti . I need a Guidry , and a John , and a Righetti , guys that can end up five or six games over . 500. " // Steinbrenner had threatened changes in his team during a meeting with reporters after the loss last Thursday , and just over 48 hours later , he had kept his promise. // Last season , when he was 22 years old , Righetti established his own standard during the strike-shortened season , which was even shorter for Righetti because he did not join the Yankees until May 21 . <> <> World Series Failing // His record was 8-4 with an earned run average of 2. 06 . He was undefeated in postseason play , with two victories in the American League East playoff against the Milwaukee Brewers and another in the league championship series against the Oakland A ' s. // But in the third game of the World Series against the Dodgers , with the Yankees leading by 2-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not lose the game , but the Yankees did , and the Dodgers went on to win the next three games and the series. // This season had been a combination of brilliance and confusion . Righetti had won two of his previous three starts going into the game Saturday night . On June 10 in a game at Fenway Park in Boston , Righetti did not allow the Red Sox a hit for six and one-third innings . Opposing batters had a combined average of . 212 against him this season , making Righetti the most difficult Yankee pitcher to hit going into his last start Saturday night. // But Righetti was removed after just three and one-third innings , equaling his second shortest outing in 14 starts this season . He was charged with three runs , two of them earned . He struck out four batters , but allowed four hits and two walks and committed a balk that helped the Indians score a run . That convinced Steinbrenner to make his move . <> <> John Blames Confusion // " There ' s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bergesch said. // Tommy John , a former teammate , said there was a reason . " Every time , " John said , " he got a different , ' Try this , try that . ' You can ' t do that . It ' s like a golfer . You can ' t say try this grip on this hole and that grip on that hole . You have to do that between starts . Dave was completely befuddled . That ' s what was offered to him , from the coaches . Dave was lost . He was absolutely lost . . . You really feel sorry for him . Here was a guy who pitched so well for us last year , and he was lost. " // " I don ' t know about that , " Bergesch said when told of John ' s opinion . " But what we are doing now should alleviate that . Now he ' s going to be listening just to Sammy for the next few weeks . We don ' t know how long . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won ' t be long . A few weeks . We have set no time limits . We made no promises. " <> <> 5 Victories , 5 Losses , 5 Coaches // Ellis will be the fifth coach to work with Righetti this season . There was the combination of Jeff Torborg and Jerry Walker , then Stan Williams , then Clyde King , and now Ellis. // " I wish it would have been possible for them to bring Sammy Ellis here , because they work very well together , " said Dave LaRoche , the relief pitcher . " It ' s too bad they couldn ' t bring him up here for two days or a week. " // " That ' s the thing , " Righetti said . " You don ' t know the feeling of going down . If they asked him to work with me there , I guess that ' s the best way to handle it . They ' re paying me , so I have to do what they tell me. " // Until early yesterday , the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile than pitchers . " I worked with him a little , " King , the coach since June 11 , said of Righetti . " He was having problems from the stretch. " // Suddenly , the pattern changed and a pitcher was moved instead of a coach . When John was asked about the idea of bringing Ellis to New York , he said : " You have to ask the man upstairs . I just pitch and I just observe. " // After a brief appearance in the clubhouse while the team was taking batting practice , Steinbrenner was not available . Bergesch said Ellis needed to remain at Columbus , because " we ' ve got other pitchers there that he has to work with. " // Righetti said he will report to the Columbus team and may pitch in a game at Pawtucket , R.I. , on Thursday . " There ' s nothing I could say that could make them change their minds , " Righetti said . " I wish there is . I can ' t let it bother me , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of here right now . I can ' t sit around . I ' ve just got to get a uniform on . That ' s where I feel most at home at , whether it ' s Columbus or here. " //
