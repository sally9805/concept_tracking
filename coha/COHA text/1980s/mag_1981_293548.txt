The killings continue in bloody El Salvador <P> <P> The brutal civil war in El Salvador was between battles last week . In the only major skirmish , Salvadoran soldiers clashed with armed teen-agers sympathetic to the rebel cause in the village of San Lorenzo . The toll , according to an army major : 40 guerrillas and one soldier dead . From their hideouts in remote areas near the border with Honduras , leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front emerged briefly to blockade roads and blow up a number of bridges and power lines . Meanwhile , death squads of both right and left still roamed the land , murdering anyone they suspected of collaborating with the other side . TIME Correspondent Bernard Diederich , who has visited El Salvador ten times in the past twelve months , returned to that terrorized country last week and sent this report : <P> <P> For a people caught in the crossfire between guerrillas and government soldiers , Salvadorans display a remarkable ability to keep up business as usual . Trucks carrying sugar cane and coffee beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses run . Most people now seem to feel that the guerrillas will eventually be defeated . Many are much more frightened by the right-wing death squads , which apparently intend to kill anyone tainted by the left . <P> Since their " final offensive " last January was blunted by the Salvadoran military and by lack of popular support , the guerrillas have made no headway in their struggle to overthrow the civilian-military junta that first took power in October 1979 . Indeed , the guerrillas ' attempts to wreck the nation 's economy by cutting town water supplies and blowing up bridges have cost them the support of many people . The town of Usulutan ( pop . 41,000 ) is without water , and San Miguel ( pop . 113,000 ) has neither electricity nor water . <P> The poorly trained government troops outnumber the guerrillas by 16,000 to 4,000 . But the soldiers are spread thinly across a country the size of Massachusetts , and their mobility is hampered by antiquated equipment , their tactics by a lack of know-how . Still , one military expert contends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from the outside " do the guerrillas have a chance at winning the war . Owing in part to the failure of the January offensive , and to the Reagan Administration 's determination to help the junta , the leftists ' support abroad is ebbing . Even the sympathetic Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua has urged the guerrillas to work out " a negotiated settlement " with the junta . <P> It may already be too late . Junta President Jos Napoleon Duarte has firmly stated that there are no negotiating points with the guerrillas , and that the people should decide what kind of government they want in " free and honest elections , " now scheduled for 1982-83 . Duarte insists that his government 's program of social reforms , especially land reform , will continue to erode support of the guerrillas . <P>
