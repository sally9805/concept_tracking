David B. Gordon , aged 67 , is a retired New York city police officer . His story , which appeared in Newsweek magazine , is a shocking indictment of what purports to be a health care system in this nation . It is a story that should frighten anyone mature enough to think beyond tomorrow , but especially those who are middle-aged , middle- class , and believe that , through prudent foresight , they have provided adequately for their retirement years . David Gordon thought he had . And anyone reading his story would think he had - would , in fact , envy him . He had , to begin with , a $20,000 a year pension from the New York city police department . In addition he and his wife were receiving $9400 from Social Security , plus $l2,000 a year from dividends and interest - a gross annual income of $41,400 . It appeared that David Gordon and his wife would be comfortably off in their retirement years . But David Gordon hadn ' t allowed for one eventuality ; not an uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s disease and other medical complications for several years , suffered a stroke . Gordon , who had looked after her at home , aided by a nurse at $400 a week , could no longer contend . She needed long-term nursing home care and therapy . The cost , about $105 daily or $38,325 a year - more than his total income after taxes . So David Gordon found that because nursing-home care under Medicare is limited to 100 days , and there is virtually no buyable insurance to cover long-term care , he would have to seek Medicaid ( health care for the impoverished ) . To qualify he would have to liquidate his savings , sign over his pension , own nothing , keep only $2600 for burial costs . He discovered that , were he in jail for murder , his pension would be inviolate , but not as a good citizen . An accountant advised him to get a divorce to protect his savings . Clearly this nation not only operates an insensitive health service , but an idiotic one . It encourages fraud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings , eliminated $1000 a month that could have contributed to his wife ' s care . What Gordon has learned , and millions of others , is that sickness in this nation , as in no other in the western world , can carry a frightening financial penalty . To survive in this nation today - whether from catastrophic illness or the incapacitating sicknesses of aging - one must be either a millionare or a pauper . Middle-class prudence , without health , is an exercise in futility . One can , of course , cheat , which is in fact encouraged by today ' s health- care amalgam of government and business through non- sensical rules and regulations . And there is divorce . Nor should anyone be led to believe that the nation is " covered " by health insurance . Only recently Douglas A. Fraser , head of the United Auto Workers , reminded government that 90 percent of those who are unemployed lose their health benefits . Between the unemployed , and those normally without health insurance , there are today at least 30 million Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gordon , who said he was at least happy about one thing . He had found a good nursing home that would take his wife , even at the expense of their bankruptcy . And he truly was lucky . Nursing home beds are at a premium today , even bad ones . And here again , as explained in a Sept. 30 article in the New England Journal of Medicine , government policies have brought about a position " where privately paying consumers obtain all the nursing-home care they desire , and Medicaid recipients fill whatever beds remain after private demand has been satisfied . " In this week ' s Journal , in another article on health care costs , expert Anne R. Somers writes , " Despite the obvious difficulties , it is inconceivable that the richest nation on earth can not devise a viable system for providing health services to its population . " Is it any wonder that Sen. Edward Kennedy is once again talking about a universal national health insurance plan. ?             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
