A rare glimpse into a solitary , single-minded nation <P> Only last month North Korea brusquely rejected the latest call for bilateral talks with its U.S.-supported neighbor , South Korea . That gesture was characteristic of one of the most self-enclosed and xenophobic Communist countries in the world . North Korea has , however , opened its doors to a rarely admitted visitor , a reporter from a U.S. news organization . TIME 's Peking Bureau Chief , David Aikman , sent this report : <P> There are only two ways to enter North Korea by commercial airliner : from China and from the Soviet Union . The symbolism is apt . For the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , as it is called , most closely resembles the China of the late 1960s or the Soviet Union of Joseph Stalin . North Korea 's President Kim Il Sung , 71 , is in fact the last surviving Communist leader installed by Stalin , and commands an idolatry that borders on the pathological . <P> The cult of Kim 's personality dominates the capital , Pyongyang ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tree-lined parks and bucolic riverbanks , the city is in many respects attractive . But virtually all its public buildings are monumental paeans in stone to the " Great Leader , " constructed in a style that might be called Marxist Triumphalism . Dominating the skyline is the Tower of the Juche Idea , a 561-ft. stone column topped by a 66-ft. torch that glows at night . Across the Taedong River is the 600-room Grand People 's Study Hall , a new national library . Near by is the Arch of Triumph , a 198-ft. marble landmark that comfortably straddles a five-lane avenue . <P> Despite such public grandeur , the modern nation of 20 million strikingly conforms to Korea 's ancient reputation as the " Hermit Kingdom . " Though the library boasts a capacity of 30 million volumes , it has only four listings under " United States , " the most recent a 1975 edition of U.S. Pharmacoepia . No foreign publications are on sale in Pyongyang . And at the Potonggang , the capital 's newest hotel , foreigners are kept under almost constant surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes of the Kim cult and the Juche Idea , a somewhat opaque notion that stresses that the masses are the agents of revolution and man is master of everything . The result is government by total mobilization . Kindergarten children march , singing , to school ; construction workers march , singing , to work . The Muscovite subway stations , all marble and murals , offer glass-framed copies of the party daily , Rodong Sinmun , on every platform . Meanwhile , at the Mansudae Art Theater , a multimillion-dollar showpiece groaning with chandeliers , the revolutionary opera Song of Paradise climaxes with the cast , assembled before a huge red sun , singing , " His grateful love has given us eternal life/ We shall relate his everlasting love from age to age .
