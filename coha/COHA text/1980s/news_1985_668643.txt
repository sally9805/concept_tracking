The Cubs claimed victory over the Dodgers Tuesday night while conceding a defeat of sorts for rookie shortstop Shawon Dunston . Following the 8-3 triumph over Fernando Valenzuela and the Dodgers in front of 48 , 187 fans , Cub manager Jim Frey announced that Dunston had been sent to Triple-A Iowa and outfielder Brian Dayett had been recalled . Dunston was not in the starting lineup Tuesday night , when the Cubs evened their record on the current trip at 3-3 . Keith Moreland sparkled defensively in right field with two sensational catches and went 2-for-3 with an RBI to improve his batting average to . 323 . Rick Sutcliffe ( 5-3 ) was not at his best , but he earned the victory with a complete game performance . " This place holds a lot of memories for me , " said Sutcliffe , who was Rookie of the Year with the Dodgers in 1979 . " My first year was a good year , the next two not so good . " Sutcliffe spaced six hits , walked four and hit a batter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable on the mound , " he said . " Overall , I ' d say Rick Sutcliffe has pitched very well this season , " Frey said . " He could have just as easily been 6-1 instead of 4-3 coming into tonight ' s game . When he gets a five- or six-run lead , he ' s a tough son of a gun . The pitcher is subject to a lot of variables he can ' t control . Runs scored by your team is one variable . And errors are another . " Frey told Dunston of his new destination following the victory . " I don ' t want to go . I can ' t benefit by going to the minor leagues , " Dunston said before the game . " I can ' t benefit from sitting on the bench . I ' m not hitting . Nobody on the team is hitting . I ' ve seen so many breaking balls . " Cubs ' president Dallas Green indicated Monday that it would be best to return Dunston to Iowa . Green said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the team . Frey said he would like to see the 22-year-old Dunston succeed , " but he is not relaxed . Every at-bat seems like an ordeal for him . " Dallas and I talked about Dunston Monday afternoon , Monday night , Tuesday afternoon . . . we ' ve been talking about him for quite a while , " Frey said . " And we talked about it again tonight after the game . The considerations are what ' s best for the ballclub and for Shawon Dunston in the long run . " Larry Bowa started at shortstop Tuesday night , and knocked in his first RBIs of the season with a bases-loaded single in the seventh . Frey said he will play both Bowa and Chris Speier , " at least for a while until one of them began to take charge . " Dunston is hitting . 194 and has committed nine errors . He made 58 errors last season , which he split between Des Moines , where he hit . 233 in 61 games , and Double-A Midland , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Arizona , I thought Shawon had a chance to juice up our offense , " Frey said . " In spring training he showed me an offensive spurt . He ran around the bases like there were no fielders . When you see this guy making contact and getting on base , he can make things happen . I thought he could give us a lift offensively . But he has struggled here of late at the plate . His defense has bothered his hitting , instead of the other way around . Frustration is the word . " The Cubs found it difficult to hide Dunston in a starting lineup that is already suffering at the plate . The Cubs entered Tuesday night ' s game hitting . 222 , and only . 206 on the road . The Cubs scored a run in the first when Valenzuela ( 3-4 ) threw a wild pitch . Gary Matthews had drawn a two-out walk before Moreland blooped a double into right , putting runners at second and third . With a one-ball , two-strike count on Jody Davis , Valenzuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . Third base coach Don Zimmer waved Moreland around third on the play , but he was out easily at the plate . The Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in their half of the first . Steve Sax walked and went to third on Ken Landreaux ' s double to right . Pedro Guererro ' s sacrifice fly to left scored Sax , and Mike Marshall gave the Dodgers the lead with a double into the left-field corner . The Cubs took a 5-2 lead in the second inning . Davis led off with a single to left . Leon Durham hit a slow tap along the first base line . Valenzuela darted off the mound but overran the ball , leaving Durham safe at first with the infield single . Bowa forced Durham at second , leaving runners at the corners . Sutcliffe then tied the game with a sharp single to center . Bob Dernier bunted for a single to load the bases . Ryne Sandberg walked , forcing in Bowa with the go-ahead run . Matthews hit a grounder up the middle that rookie shortstop Mariano Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valenzuela walked Moreland , the third Cub walk of the game , forcing in Dernier to make it 5-2 . The Cubs increased their lead to 6-2 in the fourth on an unusual inning- ending double play . Sutcliffe led off with a walk and went to third when Sandberg doubled . Matthews lofted a fly to center . Sutcliffe scored after the catch , but Sandberg was thrown out trying to advance to third a split second after Sutcliffe crossed the plate . Sutcliffe worked himself into a jam in the fourth by walking Mike Scioscia and Greg Brock . Pinch-hitter Terry Whitfield , batting for Valenzuela , lined a single to right , scoring Scioscia to make it 6-3 and putting men on first and third . Sax then hit a sinking liner to right . Moreland made a lunging shoestring catch to rob Sax of a hit and prevent another run from scoring . CAPTION : PHOTO : Shawon Dunston . Illustration PHOTO <>
