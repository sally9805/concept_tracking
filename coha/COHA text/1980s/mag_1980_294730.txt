Uniforms , like patriotism , make a comeback on campuses <P> In 1969 , antiwar protesters sprayed chicken blood over ROTC classrooms at the City College of New York . A year later , vandals trashed the Navy ROTC building at Northwestern in Evanston , Ill. , forcing the program to move under Dyche Stadium . Throughout the U.S. , armed forces instructors took to wearing civilian clothes when they walked on campus . Recalls one : " There was no sense in being harassed . " <P> But today , instructors are visible again , and the Reserve Officers Training Corps programs of the Army , Navy and Air Force are making a comeback . Enrollment is up , and so is the prestige of ROTC . " They 're not knocking our doors down , " says a Washington-based ROTC official , " but it is better . " As Barbara Patton , 24 , a cadet at Pennsylvania 's Drexel University , puts it , " The war is over . " <P> In 1973 , the year the draft was abolished , Army ROTC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 peak of 177,000 . Today the number is 65,000 . Air Force ROTC has climbed to 22,500 , only 10% below its Viet Nam peak . The military is still absent from some private colleges , including Yale , Harvard , Dartmouth , Stanford , Brown and Colgate , all of which ejected ROTC in the Viet Nam era . But Navy ROTC now has a waiting list of 30 schools that want to join the 55 other campuses that train midshipmen . Army ROTC has grown from a low of 250 schools to 279 , including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Georgetown and most major state universities . <P> One campus where the ROTC 's fortunes have improved is Princeton . There , a third of the 3,000 undergraduates were enrolled in ROTC during the early 1950s , but the number began to dwindle after the Korean War . The faculty voted to strip academic credit from military courses in 1970 , causing the Navy and Air Force to withdraw . The Army , which held the ivied fort alone , has seen its enrollment grow by 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . <P> Some rules have been relaxed to make ROTC students feel more at ease . Male cadets need not cut their hair short , and uniforms are required only during field exercises . But the telling development is that the students no longer feel they have to camouflage their armed forces connections . Says Senior Kim Thompson , 22 , Princeton 's first female cadet commander : " As a freshman , I would never dine in my eating club if I did n't have time to change out of my fatigues . Now I 'll go in uniform . " Thompson noted a sharp drop in the razzing she got after the U.S. hostages were taken in Tehran . ROTC , she feels , has also benefited from student enthusiasm for fitness and outdoor life . Says she : " We 've had more civilian participation in ROTC activities like rafting , rappelling and the marathon . "
