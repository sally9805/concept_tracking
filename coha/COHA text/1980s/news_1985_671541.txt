The survey of 92 pharmacies , out of about 1 , 400 in New York City , also showed that in neighborhoods with large populations of the elderly - for example , Astoria , Queens and Harlem - pharmacies charged higher prices and offered fewer services , such as home delivery , than pharmacies in neighborhoods with fewer elderly residents. // In addition , some pharmacies that said they offered " senior citizen discounts " did not discount the prices as much as they advertised they would , according to the study . <> <> The Problem of Mobility // " We found it shocking , " said Christopher O. Ward , who directed the study , " Drug Dollars and Nonsense : The Availability and Cost of Pharmacy Products and Services for Elderly Consumers in New York City. " // Mr. Ward , the director of the Department of Consumer Affairs research division , said he believed the pharmacies were taking advantage of the relative immobility of the elderly population and of the special nature of the prescription-drug business. // " You are dealing with a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captive audience so that there have not been the kind of market pressures or even public pressures to have the industry explain why the differences in prices exist , " he said . " We think that there hasn ' t been enough explanation of why there are differences in the prices of prescription drugs , and there is no market indication for why there should be a difference . " <> <> Other Findings in Report // These were among the report ' s other findings : // * In general , the prices of drugs are highest at pharmacies in Manhattan and lowest in Queens. // * In 29 of the 92 pharmacies surveyed , the prices of prescription drugs were either not posted , as required by law , were illegible or were partly or completely hidden. // * At 48 pharmacies to which the department sent investigators specificaly to check prices , 19 posted prices different from those they actually charged , and in most cases , they charged more than the posted price. // * Consumers can save as much as 258 percent by purchasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also save money by purchasing prescription drugs in larger quantities , subject to doctors ' approval. // The Department of Consumer Affairs began its study of prescription-drug prices , its first such survey , in February after the city ' s Department for the Aging received a complaint from an elderly person who said a pharmacy inside a hospital charged 50 percent more to fill a prescription than one not connected with the hospital. // In planning the survey , the Department of Consumer Affairs chose 23 communities in the 5 boroughs , neighborhoods that had the largest number of the city ' s elderly residents , defined as those age 65 and over . Four pharmacies were selected at random in each of those communities , and then investigators , members of the City Volunteer Corps , hand-delivered questionnaires to the stores ' pharmacists , asking for prices of 11 drugs in specific doses commonly prescribed for the elderly . The investigators also checked on special services and discounts offered. // Of the 92 pharmacies , 48 filled out the questionnaires . If they did not , investigators returned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the list or its absence. // The department ' s report on the survey did not include the names of the pharmacies involved . A spokesman for the department , Kathy Parrent , said that the pharmacies had been promised anonymity " in order to get their cooperation . " <> <> Despite the Promise // Mr. Ward said that despite that promise , " the pharmacies were less than cooperative . " Many refused to give prices for drugs over the telephone when investigators called to double-check information , and some told the investigators to leave their stores , he said. // The New York Times obtained the names of the pharmacies through a request filed under the Federal Freedom of Information Act. // Mr. Ward said that the study did not seek to explain why some pharmacies charged so much more than others . He added , however , that the differences in price and services " just can ' t be due to differences in rents and insurance. " // His contention was borne out , he said , when pharmacies in the same area , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparate prices. // For example , the survey reported that 30 75-milligram tablets of Dyazide , prescribed for high blood pressure , cost $16. 95 at the Merrick Boulevard Pharmacy , at 126-19 Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica , Queens , but only $6. 95 at Hollis Drugs Inc. , 195-33 Jamaica Avenue in Hollis , Queens , about three miles away. // The owner of the Merrick Boulevard Pharmacy , Narendra Patel , disputed the study ' s findings . He said he had never charged $16. 95 . When asked what he did charge , he at first refused to disclose the price over the telephone . When pressed , he said he added a $4 commission for filling the prescription to the price he paid for the drug - about $6. // " All pharmacists charge $4 as their prescription fee , cost plus $4 , " he said . " So I would charge $9. 90. " // Miss Parrent , the consumer affairs spokesman , said Mr. Patel had told the agency , in writing , that he charged $16. 95 when his store was surveyed earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounting the cost of the drug Dyazide in order to draw people into the store and that otherwise , the pharmacy could not make a profit. // A pharmacist at Hollis Drugs , Dhanarhaj Kabali , confirmed Mr. Patel ' s contention . " If we had to survive by selling Dyazide , we would go broke , " he said . Mr. Kabali said the price of Dyazide had gone up since the survey and that he now charged $8. 38 for 30 tablets , or with a 10 percent discount for the elderly , $7. 55. // A few minutes after Mr. Kabali spoke to The New York Times , he called back to say that he was reducing the price further , to $7. 15 to attract customers. // The study also said that although 86 of the 92 pharmacies surveyed said they offered discounts for the elderly , usually for those 65 years old and over , it was not always clear just how much the discounts reduced the price . <> <> The Matter of Discounts // For example , the survey said that one Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Flushing , which offered a 10 percent discount to people age 60 and over , actually offered the correct discount on only 1 out of 7 drugs . One drug was actually 10 cents less expensive than it should have been at the discounted price , but 5 were from 3 cents to 90 cents more expensive than they should have been with the promised discount. // In three sections of the city with the highest percentage of elderly people living below federally defined poverty levels - East and Central Harlem in Manhattan and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn - few pharmacies had delivery services . <> <> Delivery Service // In Central Harlem , for example , where 35 percent of the elderly residents are below poverty levels , none of the three pharmacies delivered . By contrast , in the Rego Park and Forest Hills communities of Queens , a section where 7. 4 percent of the elderly are below poverty levels , all four pharmacies in the survey delivered. // Miss Parrent encouraged people , especially those in low-income areas with fewer pharmacies , to shop around for prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacies will deliver without charge outside their immediate areas. // " Many of the pharmacies have home delivery , " Miss Pararent said , " but the neighborhoods with the highest number of elderly have the fewest pharmacies with home-delivery services . It is generally acknowledged that in low-income areas with no competition , they can charge pretty high prices , and there is no pressure to bring those prices down. " //
