That 's what you saw me fall into  --  ( ELI GETS UP , BUT FEELS HIS WEAKNESS AGAIN . THE SPIRIT-DANCERS HELP HIM HOLD ONTO THE SHELF OF THE GARAGE . ) That 's what hurts . Knowing I do n't have anything to give . I get the shudders  --  not just from drinking , but to think of the great hole without drinking . It 's worse than living .

It 's why you wanted to drive when you should n't have . p. 7 ELIJAH No , Virgene . I was n't feeling confident . I wanted to feel free of restraint . Who are they to tell me what to do ? Then that old woman stopped in the middle of the street in her Plymouth  --  a scarf around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ought to be arrested . VIRGENE You 're not going backwards , Eli . I 'm not going to let you . I 'm going to see you in the pow wow ring  --  I may even have someone to dance with again .

VIRGENE You heard the doctors . If you do n't stop you wo n't be able to see down the road when you drive . You wo n't remember what you 're supposed to . ELIJAH I do that now , Virgene , you have to remind me to take my medicine  --  my hands shake so bad you have to put the glass of water to my mouth  --  ( HE HOLDS OUT HIS TREMBLING ARM , BRINGS HIS JERKING HAND TO HIS MOUTH AS THOUGH IT HELD A GLASS OF WATER . ) QUANNAH Remember when our excursion for the whole day was down the three back steps of the house ?

QUANNAH You could enroll at Northeastern . p. 10 ELIJAH I ca n't read a book . I 'm an alcoholic . Our father was an alcoholic . Our grandfather  --  VIRGENE There 's a job somewhere for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . QUANNAH You could raise rabbits again .

It may be enough for you . VIRGENE We 're in No Man 's Land . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white world . QUANNAH You are if you drink  --  it 's their stuff . JAKE This is our land .

Then the dark figures again . ( THE SPIRIT-DANCERS DANCE . ) This time they 're things I 've never seen  --  ( THE SPIRIT-DANCERS PUT ON MASKS . ) They creep down from their ledge where I thrash in space .

Elijah  --  the Great Spirit is God . ( QUANNAH HOLDS TO THE CLOTHESLINE POLE IN THE YARD . VIRGENE STANDS BESIDE HER . ) Elijah was the one who called fire down from heaven . Then he left in a chariot of fire !

You pick such lost causes  --  VIRGENE He 's not lost  --  QUANNAH You have such noble goals . I 've never found anything to be noble about . p. 26 VIRGENE Eli 's had no one to follow like Jake has  --  only Sirloin always stealing that Steak House bull  --  or riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were scalps  --  QUANNAH What are you holding out for ? VIRGENE Leave me alone . I could go off and leave you and that Holy Man who climbs in your back window . Then who would help you pay the rent ? I could leave you with Eli hanging by a thread  --  QUANNAH Why do n't you look for a man who suits you ? VIRGENE Eli will  --  when has Jake taken you out to eat ?  --  or asked you to dance ? QUANNAH I have n't expected him to . VIRGENE I have n't expected much from Eli either . I just remember the fun we had before it all changed . Before Sirloin was killed  --  when all of us were together . What happened to all those years ? I 'd work all day at the dress store . My biggest worry was finding something pretty to wear that night . We 'd stomp-dance at the pow wows . Or we 'd drink at Factor 's . You and your former husband . Sirloin and me . Jake and me . Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . No one and me . We 'd sit at Sirloin 's cabin while the men played cards and you and I and the other girls talked on the front porch until the men came out  --  p. 27 QUANNAH Usually drunk  --  tripping over the pointed toes on their cowboy boots . VIRGENE And now Sirloin is dead and others have disappeared  --  and Jake is out in the garage trying to pull Eli through another night . This time Eli is going to make it . QUANNAH How do you know ? VIRGENE It 's his last chance . He would n't stop before that . He 'd live every minute he could . QUANNAH It 's been his last chance since he was born . I remember how he tormented me  --  he 'd hide my doll or ride his stick horse through my jacks game . That broomstick horse  --  maybe it was from a rummage sale or the church gave it to him  --  they were always coming out with coats or shoes that did n't fit  --  but this stick horse  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't get far  --  I can remember him stiff as the stick on his toy horse the next day . Always without money to pay his next entry fees . He ended up as a clown  --  VIRGENE I do n't want to hear what Eli did 20 years ago  --  QUANNAH Come on , Virgene , hang it up . You 're holding out for something that wo n't ever happen  --  VIRGENE No . Then I 'd be like you . p. 28 ELIJAH Ahhhhmmmm . VIRGENE Eli 's riding again . Are n't you going to run to him ? ( VIRGENE LEAVES QUANNAH AT THE CLOTHESLINE POLE AND GOES INTO THE GARAGE . SHE TURNS ON THE LIGHT . ) JAKE ( QUICKLY . ) Turn off the light ! ELIJAH No . I want the light for a moment . ( HE RUBS HIS EYES. )  --  The days and nights fly past . They flash a few times like a light bulb and then they 're gone . JAKE Sitting here in the dark , I saw the spirits in the garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage . I saw hollow crates like letters that could make words . There were so many of them  --  VIRGENE There 's nothing wrong with the sober life . You can get a driver 's license  --  ELIJAH I 've spent 20 years getting tickets and staying in trouble . They 'll never give my license back . VIRGENE When you 've got your head back they will  --  ELIJAH The spirits were dancing like snow across the road . There was a dry snow last winter  --  it waved back and forth across the pavement behind the cars  --  it was the spirits in their white dresses  --  ( ELI SEES QUANNAH ENTER THE GARAGE )  --  dancing in beaded tennis shoes . p. 29 QUANNAH If you passed up one chance to make fun of me  --  if just once  --  JAKE Leave him alone , Quannah . QUANNAH ( SHE TURNS ON HIM . ) And you , Medicine Man  --  you got just as much of the human in you  --  maybe more because I do n't pretend to be any holy woman . I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAKE Quannah , you were having trouble taking care of them . Nathan was always running off . You were sick . They were sick  --  hungry . Howard 's got a wife now who wanted them . They can take better care of them  --  QUANNAH Than me ! Their own mother ! What do you know ? You have n't had children . None of you  --  Eli never took care of his  --  it was the same as not having them  --  you 're all busy getting drunk and trying to pull one another through the knots you make for yourselves . JAKE When do the children bother you , but when you 're mad at something else  --  mainly yourself ? QUANNAH So now I 've got the child back that I 've always had . ( SHE TURNS TO ELI. )  --  Only now he 's getting more of a burden than I can handle  --  why do n't you take him to your house , Jake , since you have such a gift for caring  --  ( QUANNAH LEAVES THE GARAGE AND STANDS AT THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . I 've wanted to be like her . The Silver Pullet . Buck-buck . ( HE IMMITATES A HEN . ) Yes . She can live life . She can get right out of bed every morning and eat her Shredded Wheat with four spoonfulls of sugar on it , and get to her job on time . It means something to her ! What could it mean to me ? I stay awake thinking about it . ( HE HOLDS HIS HEAD . ) How can she do it ?  --  my own sister . How can you , Virgene ? VIRGENE There 's nothing else but this , Eli  --  until we 're angels flying around in heaven . It is n't so bad here , Eli . You get up . You work . It 's dinner . You watch television . Sleep . Then it 's another day . ELIJAH My God ! What pulls you on ? Where 's the meaning ? Our land and our way of life was taken . Our language . The words that come to replace it are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe  --  I 'm supposed to speak another man 's language . I 'm supposed to read and know how to write it ! ! I 'm supposed to stand in court and listen to their words as though they were law ? VIRGENE They are , Eli . ELIJAH No ! They 're meaningless . I 'm supposed to live without my life , but someone else 's idea of what life is ? This is n't my culture . These are n't my rules . p. 31 VIRGENE So you 're going to jump into your clown-barrel and suffocate ? That shows what power they have  --  and what little you have  --  ( JAKE GOES TO THE WINDOW AND SEES QUANNAH STANDING OUTSIDE AT THE BUSH . HE GOES TO HER . MEANWHILE VIRGENE AND ELI TALK , THOUGH THE AUDIENCE CA N'T HEAR THEIR WORDS . ) QUANNAH When have you ever done anything for me except crawl in my bed and the next day I see you in the cafe and you do n't even buy me a cup of coffee ? JAKE I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUANNAH That 's a lame excuse . JAKE Quannah , you always got a mouth full of barbed wire . QUANNAH And you always got five roads out of every situation you get yourself into . You could let them know you 're the only one  --  JAKE How can I be sure of that ? QUANNAH Nobody else comes around . Who 'd want three kids to take care of ? JAKE You do n't have them anymore . QUANNAH And still no one comes but you . JAKE You give everybody so much guff. p. 32 QUANNAH I do n't want anybody else here but you . JAKE You got a strange way of showing it . QUANNAH Maybe if something went right . Maybe if I had something to feel good about  --  even myself . JAKE ( HE TAKES HER IN HIS ARMS . ) It 's true . I can talk to the spirit world in the pipe ceremony and think what a Holy Man I am , and the next night I 'm crawling to you  --  QUANNAH Is n't that what it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same log ? You just think you 're up there above us all . ( SHE BACKS AWAY FROM JAKE . ) That 's why you get mad at me sometimes . That 's why you ignore me at the cafe . I 'm the reminder you 're not only a Holy Man  --  VIRGENE ( SHE COMES OUTSIDE . ) Eli is restless again , Jake . QUANNAH  --  Always him . ( SHE GOES INTO THE GARAGE , LOOKS AT ELI WHO SITS WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND DOES N'T SEE HER . SOON SHE GOES TO HIM AND SITS BESIDE HIM ON THE GARAGE FLOOR . ) VIRGENE ( SHE STAYS OUTSIDE A MOMENT WITH JAKE . ) You use Quannah  --  p. 33 JAKE She enjoys it too . VIRGENE But it still seems to be to your benefit . She comes away feeling used  --  and you crow . JAKE Who 's crowing ? VIRGENE  --  Until , of course you have to bring around the pipe and then you 're humble but the spirits still talk to you . You tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remind us of the visions of the Fathers , the earth longing for its healing  --  you can even make sense of Christianity . You tie it up with the fragments we got left of our own religion  --  maybe that 's the new ground we start from  --  you really are bulletproof  --  you always make it through without wounds  --  JAKE We 're ALL in pain because the earth is . VIRGENE I 've always looked up to you , Jake . I do n't care how many times you crawl into Quannah 's window . I just wish you 'd knock on her front door for a change . Why do n't you buy her a cup of coffee ? Why do n't you come and sit down by us in the cafe ? Why , you could even buy her a chicken-fried steak one night . JAKE It would become a habit . Then how would I not do it the next night ? VIRGENE We 're all on our own here  --  when we get to economics . But it 's when we get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are superior  --  p. 34 JAKE You sound like Quannah . VIRGENE I 've lived with her too long I guess . In fact  --  ( VIRGENE STARTS TO SAY SOMETHING , CHANGES HER MIND , THEN STARTS TO SPEAK AGAIN . ) How many times have you eaten with us , Jake ? I mean , sure , you bring Eli home and we 'd be sitting there at the table , and ah , come on , sit down it 's no trouble and when the food was gone you quit eating . I mean , both Quannah and I work . There 's not much rent to this place on the edge of Tahlequah . I do n't rely on church clothes anymore . I do n't have to go to the hand-me-down store though I like the clothes there . In fact , I got this dress there  --  ( SHE SEEMS IN A QUANDRY AS TO WHAT TO SAY . ) I need to shorten it a bit .

I 'll drive him to Factor 's myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  then he 'd get it over with . JAKE No , Virgene . ELIJAH I do n't want to go into that black hole .

The worst is over  --  ( JAKE MOANS AGAIN AND PULLS UP INTO A BALL TO AVOID VIRGENE. ) p. 39 QUANNAH The worst is never over . The worst is always waiting like a row of aluminum cans on the fence . VIRGENE Some nights we 're sitting out there on the back steps . ( SHE MOTIONS TOWARD THE HOUSE . ) The bugs chirp in the woods . The twigs snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars are wide-eyed  --  but that road still disappears into the dark . Sometimes you think you hear a car stop somewhere .

Unless he comes back to himself  --  and I see him like he was before  --  years ago  --  when I thought there was no man like Elijah . Even when you 're in Quannah 's room for the night , Jake  --  it still feels like we 're here by ourselves .

Some spook wearing a headband or  --  JAKE I 'm going to keep coming to your house . ELIJAH You do n't know what a spook is , Quannah . Neither of you do . ( HE BRUSHES THE HAIR OUT OF HIS FACE . ) You do n't know what it 's like having them in your head where no gun can get to them . Each night they crawl up the road with their headlight eyes . They go right into you and there 's nothing you can do . You hear their voices call you  --  you feel their fingernails scratching the inside of your eyes  --  making their cave drawings on your skull . QUANNAH Shit  --  I 'm tired of your spook stories .

So I got to do everything he should have been doing in this one . He could clown his way out of anything . Or put on such a horror show you did n't task anything of him . He 's the space man , all right . He 's sure not made for this world . ( SHE SLAPS HER HANDS TO HER THIGHS IN BOTH ANGER AND DESPERATION FOR HER BROTHER . ) I can do things like cook his meals and wash the vomit off his shirts .

After that , there was an ice storm  --  and I was driving too fast to Virgene and Quannah 's and the car skidded off the road and down the embankment . ELIJAH And you were screaming , Jesus. You were screaming , Stone man , old giver of our medicine. JAKE I had our ass covered . ELIJAH Forward and backward . JAKE Yo . And I tried to stomp-dance the car out of the ditch , but finally had to walk back up the road to the highway to get a tow truck . It did n't spin and spin its wheels to pull us out , Eli .

But the ice  --  it seems like words to me  --  words that move around it in the snow . Sometimes I hear words , Jake , but I do n't know what they 're saying  --  they 're not talking to me , but go right by  --  like cars when I 'm drunk and trying to hitchhike back to Virgene .

Sometimes Texas or New Mexico . I remember the trip we took across the desert to California , and the Last Chance Texaco station . I remember Sirloin in his bare feet dancing on the hot pavement .

The white blossoms of them in spring . JAKE Then I 'm bringing you a bag of apples too . p. 55 QUANNAH About the time I got used to you , you 'd be gone . JAKE You ca n't hold something all closed up in a plastic bag . You got to let things breathe . QUANNAH I would have trouble , Jake , with your kind of breathing .

JAKE A spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paws the air . ( HE LETS GO OF QUANNAH . ) I see the sky above him . How bright the stars shine , Quannah . A lighted marquee ! I see the end of the ages ! ! AHHHH !

VIRGENE My father told me not drink . ( VIRGENE TRIES TO HOLD ELI 'S ATTENTION . ) He told me not to fish for men . We marched up the backroad in the muck of history . Now we 'd take responsibility and turn every page . QUANNAH He ho hey ho . VIRGENE I read the fisherman 's catalogue at the laundromat  --  while Eli 's hand went round and around like a dryer in the Indian hospital when he was drying out . I remember my father in his Sears &amp; Roebuck hip-boots and tackle box . How we laughed at him . How I hated fishing , shoving the sharp hook through the worm like a rod into the spine . I read the names of the bait and lures : Fire Claw . Hula Popper . Slider Worm . Hot afternoons and dark nights until mosquitos raised slaps of a ruler across the hand . ( HERE THE SPIRIT-DANCERS ENTER LIKE FISHERMAN AND LURES . VIRGENE AND QUANNAH UNFOLD THE FENCE WIRE AGAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE A QUILT . THEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I pull it from the dryer .

ELIJAH I may even read  --  The Farmer 's Almanac , The Wallstreet Journal , The National Inquirer . VIRGENE I 've got a fisherman 's catalogue  --  ELIJAH I 've got a hundred fragments and broken pieces to sweep back together  --  VIRGENE Maybe you could work in the Indian hospital again  --  sweeping floors  --  ( ELI PULLS INTO HIMSELF AGAIN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corral for my stick-horse . ( THE SPIRIT-DANCERS KICK THE FENCE WIRE SO IT ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR . ) I fill the black hole with sawdust . I will talk to the metal tumbleweed and say peace to the uprisings in my head .

I look at my stick horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war-mask for him . QUANNAH I 'll make a war-mask for him . ELIJAH Sometimes I wonder what it was like to be us . JAKE Sometimes I have that thought too  --  when the sun weaves its old patterns on the wall  --  I think we were once whole  --  like a dream we had in the night and ca n't remember when we wake . QUANNAH There 's as much difference as there is between the plastic Steak House bull and the real one in the rodeo. p. 63 JAKE We 're not really visible . Our heritage has been erased and we live without a sense of who we were . We 're the people who live without our lives  --  whose arms and legs move at times without our bodies  --  whose thoughts move without the heart and mind . ELIJAH I told our father once I would be different . But I was n't  --  what an asshole I was  --  I wish he were here now  --  last of the 49'ers  --  Old Norvall  --  I 'd tell him  --  VIRGENE I 'd tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without us HOLDING you , or locking  --  ( SHE DOES N'T SAY WHAT SHE 'S THINKING . ) Light the pipe , now , Jake  --  JAKE They 're always nagging , Eli  --  VIRGENE I feel it too  --  the peace you say comes like hummingbirds in a tornado . QUANNAH You 're quiet , Jake  --  JAKE I was listening to the ancestors . I heard their Cherokee voices in the corners of the garage  --  and over the roof  --  Mother Earth , we 've made a garage floor of you  --  ( HE PATS THE GROUND. )  --  And yet I feel your presence .

WHEN QUANNAH HAS HER TURN , SHE RETURNS IT TO JAKE . ) VIRGENE What did the ancestors say ? ( JAKE PUFFS ON THE PIPE AND SETS IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR CIRCLE . ) JAKE For Quannah to get her beaded shoes ready . We 're going to a pow wow . QUANNAH Ah-ho . ( QUANNAH LAUGHS . ) JAKE They said for Eli to get a job at the bait farm  --  VIRGENE Ah-ho . JAKE They said for you and Quannah to park your Volkswagon in the garage instead of leaving it in the yard all night . A raccoon jumped out when I drove up tonight  --  VIRGENE It was probably after one of Quannah 's stale peanut butter sandwiches . QUANNAH I think the squirrels bury their nuts in there too . p. 65 VIRGENE Do you still hear the voices , Jake ? JAKE Yes . Sometimes they say things which are not for now . ELIJAH The next time I hear them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living Hang Man !

ELIJAH I was sitting out here in the garage the other day . ( SHRUGS . ) Maybe the other month . The wind was blowing hard enough the window glass rattled . There 's a shingle loose somewhere on the roof . I heard it flapping . The wind eased through the cracks in the garage ( HE STARTS TO PANIC AGAIN )  --  hissing until I picked it up ! VIRGENE I heard Eli in the garage that windy day  --  I thought at first he really saw a sssn  --  ( SHE CA N'T BRING HERSELF TO SAY SNAKE . ) But  --  wheew ! Quannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood against it until you got here , Jake  --  p. 66 QUANNAH After that he was in the hospital  --  VIRGENE He did n't even think to break the window  --  QUANNAH He was crazy  --  ELIJAH AAAAhhhhhHH ! ( HE MOANS AGAIN AS THE SPIRIT-DANCERS COME AROUND HIM , LICK HIS FACE . ) Will I be new again ? JAKE Yes , because you 've said you will  --  just wait until you catch up with your words . VIRGENE I see the spirits in the garage now , Eli  --  ( TRYING TO COMFORT HIM . ) The good ones dressed in their white dresses  --  last winter when it snowed , I came out to get in the car  --  and there were thin , white lines of snow on the garage floor . They blew in through the cracks in the walls . Tonight in the moonlight , I saw the little ghosts of snowdrifts in the air  --  and it 's June instead of winter  --  QUANNAH I thought the snow was like the fairground lights when I saw it . ELIJAH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norvall , Quannah  --  he would have been 60  --  QUANNAH Even I forgot  --  ( PAUSE . ) His birthday was the last of March . p. 67 VIRGENE You 're remembering , Eli .

All I need is the first 32 years to put with it  --  ( THE SPIRIT-DANCERS BEGIN TO RODEO . ) JAKE ( HE PICKS UP THE PIPE AND PUFFS ON IT . ) Eetowah  --  the Holy fire  --  the ceremony we once had  --  lighting the small fires in our cabins from the larger campfire  --  ( HE PASSES THE PIPE TO ELI , WHO PUFFS AND PASSES IT TO VIRGENE . SHE GIVES IT TO QUANNAH . ) QUANNAH It 's not a second hand faith we got . No  --  it 's store-bought  --  JAKE ( SHE RETURNS THE PIPE TO JAKE . ) Eetowah . ELIJAH You sit in our circle , Jake  --  but you had someone guiding you . You had your father holding you on the road while mine dug up anything I had  --  never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proof , I 've known when you crawled in Quannah 's window  --  JAKE ( MOANS . ) Ayyyay . ELIJAH Sometimes I do n't sleep  --  most times I do n't sleep  --  but in short fits like poker chips between those awful times I lie awake  --  ( HE TRIES TO PUSH THE SPIRIT-DANCERS AWAY , BUT THEY KEEP PULLING HIM UP BY THE ARMS. ) p. 68 JAKE I 'm sorry , Quannah . QUANNAH Do I lock my window ? VIRGENE Maybe soon you 'll sleep at night  --  ELIJAH Maybe soon I 'll sleep  --  JAKE ( JAKE STANDS AND PULLS THE LIGHT CORD . THE GARAGE IS DARK AGAIN EXCEPT FOR THE MOONLIGHT . JAKE SITS DOWN AND PICKS UP THE PIPE . ) It 's a stacked deck we 're born into . But this night I say  --  THIS is the light I have left from the Eetowah fire  --  it lights a smaller fire which I carry inside me now  --  ( HE PUFFS THE PIPE AND A SMALL GLOW IS SEEN IN THE DARKNESS. )  --  I live .
