The first act took place in Blake ' s garden in Lambeth , where we encountered Blake and his wife ( Michael Maloney and Lesley Clare O ' Neill ) , up a tree , naked . When Paine ( Bob Peck ) arrived for an unexpected visit , the Blakes remained unclothed for a time , then with the announcement of a chill in the air , the couple went indoors to dress - to the sound of laughter from the uncomfortable theatergoers. // " In Lambeth " is an informative and thought-provoking dialogue about the uses of revolution , and the varieties of radical commitment . The cross-purposes of art and politics are scrutinized by the two contrasting Englishmen and by Mrs. Blake , who can say - ingenuously , not condescendingly - to their guest , " And what were you doing in America ? " To which the play ' s Paine answers forthrightly , " Fighting the war of independence. " // All three performances added luster to the work , especially so in the case of Mr. Peck , celebrated for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic John Browdie in " Nicholas Nickelby . " He has the zeal to play Paine and the boldness to do it for two sweltering weeks on the Fringe , far away from the center of London theater . One reason for Mr. Peck ' s appearance in such offbeat surroundings is that , in common with the playwright , he lives in nearby Dulwich . Because of the critical and audience response , it is expected that " In Lambeth " will return , presumably in less humid circumstances . <> <> Heat and Strikes // The weather - the warmest in 13 years - and repeated transit strikes were blamed for a drop in London box-office receipts . Trying to combat that loss , box-office personnel in at least one theater were told to lie when asked if the theater was air-conditioned . As theatergoers discovered , one could count on coolness only at the institutional theaters , the National , the Royal Shakespeare Company , and - a refreshing newcomer to audience comfort - the Royal Court. // The theaters themselves remain London ' s pride , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by urban redevelopers . They are jewelbox reminders of English theatrical history . I thought I had been in all the active West End houses , but , sitting in the Strand ( the play was " Much Ado About Nothing " ) I realized that I had never been in this splendid theater before . The reason was self-evident . For 10 years the Strand was the home of " No Sex Please , We ' re British . " <> <> A Tom Murphy Revival // As it turned out , " In Lambeth " was one of the few rewarding new plays of the summer , along with Richard Nelson ' s " Some Americans Abroad " ( at the Royal Shakespeare Company ) . Another recent Royal Shakespeare opening proved to be less auspicious - the London premiere of Robert Holman ' s " Across Oka . " The play is an ornithological epic , centering on an almost extinct crane whose eggs are transported across continents ( and the Oka preserve in the Soviet Union ) . A Russian scientist is trying to propagate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two teen-age boys , who , as the audience suspects , will soon shatter their Anglo-Soviet detente . Though high-minded , the play manages to be both predictable and unbelievable. // The most powerful contemporary play , though not a new one , was Tom Murphy ' s " Whistle in the Dark , " which , in the Abbey Theater production , was presented at the Royal Court as part of the London International Festival of Theater . Written in 1960 , when Mr. Murphy was 25 years old , the play has lost none of its riveting sense of menace . This is an excoriating drama about family and country , offering an uncompromisingly harsh group portrait of Irishmen at war with themselves . The Carneys are a family of braggarts and brawlers , brought up by their father to battle one another but never to question his authority . Beneath the father ' s prideful boasts , he is a coward , and his sons are in various ways failures. // Garry Hynes ' s volatile production begins in chaos , as the men of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities emerge - the eldest brother , who is regarded as an intellectual but is as ineffectual and as cowardly as his father ; and his brutish brothers , who live by their wits and their fists. // The most moving in a fine cast was Sean McGinley as the one brother who , beneath his vulgarity , has the strongest sense of fidelity and family . When the father ( Godfrey Quigley ) blathers excuses for not joining his sons in their blood feud against their rivals , Mr. McGinley signals with his silence that he understands the deficiencies and the self-defeats of the warring Carneys. // Though only a guest production , " A Whistle in the Dark " seems a definitive Royal Court play of the naturalistic school , reminiscent of the early work of John Osborne and David Storey . Mr. Murphy , an unjustly neglected playwright , has written a dozen plays in the intervening years. few of which have been presented in the United States. // One of them , the provocative " Conversations on a Homecoming , " briefly appeared several seasons ago at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another chance to see " A Whistle in the Dark " if , as planned , the Irish Repertory Theater is able to bring its recent revival for an extended engagement this fall. // The two most popular shows in London - with ticket sales unaffected by the weather - are " The Merchant of Venice , " with Dustin Hoffman and Geraldine James , and Andrew Lloyd Webber ' s " Aspects of Love , " both of which are scheduled to go to Broadway . In direct contrast to the play " In Lambeth , " " The Merchant of Venice " has the most elaborate costumes , making it for the actors the warmest play in London . <> <> Pique Over Sondheim // As usual in London , some of the most theatrical events took place offstage , as was the case with the announcement that Stephen Sondheim had been chosen to fill the first Oxford University chair in theater , a professorship endowed by the producer Cameron Mackintosh , who gave Oxford $2. 8 million to expand the university ' s theater program. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accepting the money and the appointment Oxford had made a Faustian pact with the commercial theater . If Mr. Sondheim ' s equivalent in England - Harold Pinter or Tom Stoppard - were appointed to a chair at an American university , there certainly would not be a similar outcry . <> <> Sheik Zubayr // A minor theatrical contretemps arose when it was reported in the London newspapers that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had claimed that Shakespeare was an Arab and that his real name was Sheik Zubayr , a reference to a seventh-century convert to Islam . Actually , Colonel Qaddafi had simply repeated a joke he had first made in a speech last year , but Elizabethan scholars were quick to take up their Shakespeares and to reiterate counterclaims that Bacon , Marlowe and the Earl of Oxford were the real authors of Shakespeare ' s plays. // Should Colonel Quaddafi ' s candidate be certified , it would , of course , necessitate a name change for the Royal Shakespeare Company . It would become the Royal Sheik Zubayr Company - the R.S.Z.C. //      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
