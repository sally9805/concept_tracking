Compared with the misfortunes of Union Carbide , Job had it easy . The company 's problems began nearly a decade ago with a profit slump that has persisted ever since . Then this past December came the leak of methyl isocyanate gas from a plant in Bhopal , India , which killed 2,500 people and provoked more than $100 billion in lawsuits . Last month Union Carbide fell deeper into trouble when a toxic leak in Institute , W. Va. , sent 135 people to the hospital and prompted an additional $88 million in suits . Now Union Carbide faces a potential assault by corporate raiders who hope that the company is too distracted by its other woes to put up a struggle . <P> But Union Carbide ( 1984 sales : $9.5 billion ) aims to reverse its fortunes . Last week the Danbury , Conn. - based company dramatically retrenched its operations , announcing that it will eliminate 4,000 white-collar jobs , thereby reducing its work force about 15% . The firm will close several unprofitable plants and make other moves to slim down operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give Union Carbide an estimated net loss of $250 million for 1985 , compared with a profit of $323 million in 1984 . In a step that could dissuade raiders , the company plans to buy back $500 million of its stock . <P> These defensive moves may come too late . GAF ( 1984 sales : $731 million ) , a much smaller , New Jersey-based building products and chemical company , has already begun to go after Union Carbide . GAF has bought nearly 10% of Union Carbide 's shares and is seeking regulatory approval to increase its stake to as much as 15% . While it may lack the financial clout to stage a successful takeover , GAF could force Union Carbide to hand over a treasured division , perhaps one of its specialty-chemicals businesses , as a payoff to end the hostile raid . <P> Union Carbide 's long-term woes stem partly from its slowness to adjust to a slump in the chemicals business , particularly in petroleum-based products . The company 's financial performance has lagged behind such rivals as Du Pont and Monsanto for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Carbide is expected to put less emphasis on petrochemicals so that it can concentrate on its more successful business lines , including industrial gases ( nitrogen , argon , oxygen ) and consumer products ( Eveready batteries , Glad bags , Prestone antifreeze ) . <P> One of the most important questions facing the company has nothing to do with business . It is the location of trials for the lawsuits growing out of the Bhopal disaster . If the cases are heard in the U.S. , the company may have to pay at least $2 billion and possibly $6 billion or more in settlements . But if Union Carbide wins its plea to have the trials held in India , where liability payments would be much lower , the cost could be $500 million or less . <P> As if the company 's public image were not blackened enough , Union Carbide suffered another toxic leak last week . A cloud of hydrochloric acid escaped from its South Charleston , W. Va. , plant , briefly threatening 60,000 people attending an outdoor festival . But this time the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical with water to dilute it , and no one was seriously injured . Union Carbide can only hope that last week 's painful cutbacks will be just as effective .
