Retro SITTING in the theatre where " Terms of Endearment " was being previewed , and listening to the sniffles and sobs of the audience that only a few minutes before had been laughing , I flashed back to " Penny Serenade " in 1941 , the picture in which Irene Dunne and Cary Grant as a young married couple stood by helplessly as their little adopted daughter died . And I watched as , once again , the survivors overcame their pettiness and selfishness and showed the strength they had in them ; they demonstrated their American middle-class ( white ) moral fiber . This is a real-life-tragedy movie that leaves you no choice but to find it irresistible . It 's exactly the kind of bogus picture that will have people saying , " I saw myself in those characters . " Of course they 'll see themselves in " Terms of Endear  --  ment . " James L. Brooks , who directed it , guides the actors with both eyes on the audience . He works this way in perfect sincer  --  ity . Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mary Tyler Moore Show , " and he and three other fellows put " Taxi " together ; as a writer-producer on those series ( and others ) , he developed a sixth sense for what makes TV-watchers laugh . An enthusiastic reviewer said of the char  --  acters in " Terms of En  --  dearment , " " You would be happy to spend several more hours in their com  --  pany . " That 's exactly how you feel about the best half-hour series shows . They 're entertaining in a random , eccentric way ; you have no idea what will happen next . The acting has a comic-strip frame around it ; it 's stylized and comfy . The actors are out to please you and keep you coming back for more . And you want to like them . The characters they play represent our own notions of who or what we would be if ( if we were snobs or buffoons , or whatever ) . Sometimes watching a character is like watching our alter ego Retro going at a problem . Often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ( Of course , they 're not really demolished : they continue to have lives after the com  --  mercial . ) In " Terms of Endearment , " which Brooks adapted from the 1975 Larry McMurtry novel , he keeps the audi  --  ence giggling over the same kind of ramshackle comedy . Shirley MacLaine is all tics as Aurora Greenway , a snap  --  pish , compulsively neat widow tending her house and garden in the prosper  --  ous River Oaks section of Houston  --  a Southwestern Scarsdale . Aurora is a little dotty : in our first view of her , she 's climbing into her sleeping in  --  fant 's crib to make sure the baby has n't died . Everything about her  --  her pert little expressions , her pinched-tight mouth and narrowed eyes , her stand-offishness , and even the pair of devoted suitors who hang around for years  --  is quaint . This is n't meant as a putdown of Shirley MacLaine 's performance ; I do n't know how else the role could be played . Aurora does n't exist except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a cartoon : a rich skinflint with a blond dye job and pastel frills . Surely she 's not meant to be believable ? She 's a TV-museum piece , like the characters in " Mary Hartman , Mary Hartman " or " Soap ; " she 's warped . And so is the pie-eyed lecher who 's her next-door neighbor  --  a former astronaut named Garrett Breedlove , played by Jack Nicholson . ( It 's only in the world of TV comedy that characters have next-door neighbors . ) Spanning thirty years in the lives of the cantankerous Aurora and her straightforward daughter , Emma  --  played from adolescence on by Debra Winger  --  the movie is one droll payoff after another , with Nicholson kept on the sidelines until Emma , married and with a child ( and another on the way ) , moves to Iowa with her husband , and , after a time , Aurora and Garrett Breedlove have an affair . It 's a screwball , sitcom affair , but Brooks pulls some sleight of hand and " real feelings " come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guzzler , THE NEV YORKEik quate to what he 's doing here  --  ex  --  tending half-hour gag comedy to fea  --  ture length by the use of superlative actors who can entertain us even when the material is arch and hopped-up . The movie gains its only suspense from keeping Jack Nicholson waiting in the wings for almost half its run  --  ning time . After eleven years of living next door , Garrett asks Aurora out to lunch ; four more years pass before she accepts . By that time , you 're so primed that his every kidding leer rocks the theatre . When he comes on to her in the Nicholson lewd , seductive manner and tells her that she brings out the devil in him , it may sound like the wittiest , most obscene thing you 've ever heard . The years have given Nicholson an impressive , broader face , and his comedy has never been more alert , more polished . He is n't getting laughs because of his lines ; he 's get  --  ting them because of his insinuating delivery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation to lunch , this flabby old astronaut glances up at the heavens as if to ask , " Why did you make me so sexy ? " Whatever Nicholson does  --  lick his lips , roll back his eyes , stoop slightly , or just turn his head  --  he keeps the audience up . There 's a charge of fun in his acting ; he lets you see the had boy inside him . When Garrett stands , stripped to his trunks , in Aurora 's bed  --  room , it is n't just the flab hanging out that makes him funny  --  it 's that he stands like a dirty-minded little kid who has n't yet learned to suck in his gut , and an old sex warrior who ca n't he bothered . There 's nothing visually engaging in the movie except the actors . I liked the way Shirley MacLaine flung her  --  self about in a hospital scene : Aurora has a tantrum because the nurses have failed to bring a suffering patient a scheduled painkiller , and you feel the emotions that Aurora has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target she can find . ( This tour-de  --  force scene was the one time Aurora 's rambunctiousness seemed to have any subtext . ) I liked the desolate look on Lithgow 's yearning face when Emma says goodbye to him . There are enjoy  --  able bits all through this movie ; a staggering amount of contrivance has gone into it , and when all else fails , Nicholson 's sparse hair sticks out at the sides of his head , or something else is surprising and screwy . Brooks does perhaps his best directing with the two small boys ( Troy Bishop and Huckle  --  berry Fox ) who play Emma 's sons THE NEW YORKER Charles Martin Smith was the Toad in " American Graffiti , " and he was very likable as one of the three Crick  --  ets in " The Buddy Elolly Story . " He has a boyish quality , and Ballard must have felt that audiences would identify with him , especially since Tyler starts out as what in Westerns used to be called a tenderfoot . But the boyishness that comes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify with  --  Smith 's Tyler is crabbed , plod  --  ding , and , at the start , ineffectual . The performance feels thought out in advance . In the beginning , Smith is deliberately dopey ; then he drops the dopiness  --  and Tyler is just a dull , well-meaning fellow . He 's dull even when lie behaves heroically . And  --  what 's crucial here  --  there 's nothing natural about the performance , and no sense of discovery in it . The cruel fact is that more wolves would have helped ; wolves that were more accommodating would have helped , too . The animals on the screen just do n't seem eager to act out their roles , and they 're not strong in the grandeur department  --  they look sort of scroungy . Children who went to see " The Black Stallion " could believe in that mythological horse because Bal  --  lard had fully created him ; the wolves here are never characters . Despite the names that Tyler gives them , they have no discernible personalities , and nothing really happens between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp eyes are playing out a script of their own devis  --  ing . Ballard 's theme is the magic to be found in nature . From the way the movie turned out , it appears that when he could n't get magic out of Smith or out of the wolves he fell back on the snowscapes . In " Stallion , " you knew whose imagination was being fired  --  the child 's . Here there 's a lot of free-floating transcendence . It does n't serve the prosaic story , but it certainly holds you . It holds you even though you may forget what the movie is trying to be about . Everything that Ballard ( work  --  ing with Hiro Narita as the cinema  --  tographer ) shoots seems new , and it has a distinctive , shimmering purity . The only disadvantage of this is that since the essence of what Tyler learns is that wolves actually serve the ecol  --  ogy of the area , the movie 's luminous vistas can give you the uncomfortable feeling that you 're being handed a high-minded flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wolves actually keep the caribou herds strong
