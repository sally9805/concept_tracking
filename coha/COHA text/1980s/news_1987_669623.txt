The drastic decline of the national currency , skyrocketing inflation , and a breakdown of many public services make meeting life ' s basic needs a major preoccupation for almost all social classes. // ' ' The majority of Lebanese children do not have access to milk anymore , and the quality of the food they are getting has dropped badly , ' ' says Marwan Sidani , acting director of the Lebanon program for the British branch of Save the Children Fund . ' ' We know of 100 , 000 families , with some 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 children under six , in dire need of help . They have had to cut out such staples as oil , grains , sugar , and milk , and they live off bread , which is subsidized . Even that takes up 70 percent of their income. // // ' ' It is not starvation yet , but it is threatening . I can show you children who are getting only one meal a day , of bread sprinkled with thyme , ' ' Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy - notably tourism , banking , and services - were either destroyed or badly damaged by successive rounds of civil strife since 1975. // After holding firm against the United States dollar for the first 10 years of crisis , the Lebanese pound first showed signs of weakening in the summer of 1985 . Economists and bankers warned that a major economic crisis was inevitable unless a political settlement brought stability. // But there has been no political solution . The economic crunch has arrived with a vengeance . ' ' It represents the cumulative result of all the years of destruction , the progressive erosion of the country ' s social and economic fabric , and general despair over the prospects for a political settlement , ' ' says economic consultant Riad Khouri. // After a steady decline since last year , the Lebanese pound ( L(STR) ) nosedived in recent months to its current level of around 500 to the dollar , with no floor in sight . Since most of the country ' s consumer goods and foodstuffs are imported , prices have soared , often doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // One recent report assessed the current annual rate of inflation at 678 percent. // For many workers taking home the minimum monthly wage , the L(STR)8 , 600 they earn is now worth a paltry $17 . That is not enough to buy two small sandwiches a day. // ' ' If I buy one tin of powdered milk and one packet of disposable diapers - not enough for a month - I have already spent more than the minimum wage , ' ' says Lillian Dagher , a mother of three. // While the wealthy elite were able to switch their capital into dollars or other hard currency early on , people whose income is fixed in Lebanese pounds - the vast majority of blue- and white-collar workers and public officials - have found themselves reduced to subsistence level. // Bankers say there is a great deal of private wealth that would reenter the economy as soon as a political settlement was reached , and few economists doubt that there would be something of a boom . But the chances of a settlement ' s being reached between estranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general prediction is that the country faces its longest and darkest winter yet. // Prices of everything from clothes to cement - all but the most basic commodities - are now set in dollars and translated into Lebanese pounds at the prevailing daily rate . For those with incomes in the local currency , this has carried prices into the realm of fantasy. // It is like an American waking up to find that a soft drink costs $100 , a pair of shoes $5 , 000 . The price of a restaurant meal for four would have bought a limousine a few years ago. // ' ' Life became totally impossible , ' ' says Abdullah Qasim , one of many breadwinners who , having stuck it out through all the upheavals , are now forced to seek work abroad and send cash home to their families . ' ' My last job working for a Muslim charity was paying L(STR)9 , 000 a month - about $18 . With three teenage children in school , how could we begin to live on that ?

A few hundred dollars sent from outside may have to spread across an increasingly large family network , as needy relatives turn to kin for help. // Community-based charities among both Muslims and Christians have taken on an increasingly important role in helping those most in need . Outside aid organizations are working hard to keep starvation at bay , too . The Lebanese state system , paralyzed , fragmented , and almost bankrupt is unable to help. // Signs of the hard times are apparent on Hamra Street , Beirut ' s equivalent of Fifth Avenue in prosperous pre-war days . Every morning , the sidewalks are jammed with people buying and selling dollars. // ' ' Everybody changes their salaries into dollars at the beginning of the month , and their fortunes rise and fall with the dollar , ' ' says a Beirut bartender . A half-dozen local radio stations give hourly updates of exchange rates. // On a side street , a Sunday morning flea market has sprung up , offering a bizarre and depressing assortment of used and stolen articles , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical wire and hose pipe and other worthless items , some of them scavenged off street-corner garbage heaps. // ' ' The people who go through the garbage are not finding much nowadays , ' ' says one West Beirut resident . ' ' Very little that might be worth anything at all is being thrown away now , and what there is gets picked out straight away. ' ' // In addition to the economic squeeze , the difficulties of life in Beirut are aggravated by frequent shortages of basic commodities and essential services. // Lengthy and unpredictable power blackouts occur almost every day . Making a few local phone calls can be a frustrating day ' s work , and calls between east and west Beirut are virtually impossible. // ' ' We Lebanese are worrying all day long about gasoline , about bread , about electricity , about medicines - we don ' t have time to think about anything else , ' ' says Muhammad Abboud , a carpenter. // Because gasoline , bread , and bottled gas for cooking are subsidized , supplies disappear onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warring sectarian militias are widely accused of leading the racketeering. // Only after the government recently raised the official price of gasoline to L(STR)111 , 400 for 20 liters ( it was ( STR ) 1 , 117 a few years ago ) did supplies begin to reappear at gas stations - albeit with a militia percentage tacked on . The militia mafiosi , some merchants , and people on dollar salaries survived and even prospered. // ' ' The government has been subsidizing the militias , and is being bankrupted by them , ' ' says one militia official. // Tomorrow : Iranian money helps Islamic radicals gain support among Lebanon ' s hardest hit community - the Shiites. // //
