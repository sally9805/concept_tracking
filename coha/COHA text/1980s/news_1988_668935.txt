Bryant Gumbel had come to talk about his role as host of NBC ' s forthcoming Olympics coverage , but television critics gathered at the networks ' West Coast press tour didn ' t want to hear about that . They wanted to know about his new multimillion-dollar contract , his long- simmering feud with " Late Night " host David Letterman and whether he really thought he could match ABC ' s Jim McKay with his reputation as the quintessential host of the Summer Games . All the prodding made Gumbel cross . " I can rest pretty well assured that whatever is done , 25 percent of you won ' t like it , " he said . " We ' ve become a nation of critics . We set up situations that make it impossible for someone to succeed , and I think that ' s kind of sad . " Gumbel said he failed to see what all the fuss over his multiyear , multimillion-dollar contract was about . He responded with a big-league analogy . " A guy who loves baseball and thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play baseball looks at Don Mattingly getting 2 million bucks and says , ' That ' s a joke ; I ' d pay them to let me play . ' But what ' s Don Mattingly supposed to do ? Should he take $50 , 000 just to make this guy feel better ? Does Mattingly walk around saying that , yes , in the grand scheme of life a first baseman who hits . 338 is worth $2 million ? Probably not , but in 1988 in baseball , is an MVP first-baseman worth that price ? Obviously , yes . " Gumbel said it was loyalty , not money , that kept him at NBC , whose contract offer " certainly wasn ' t the most lucrative out there . " " Most of us are creatures of habit , whether it be a wife , a house , a car , a dog or a job , " he said . " We don ' t like to change . Ultimately , I was satisfied with the degree of faith and , for lack of a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was the subject of Letterman , however , that rankled Gumbel most . Three years ago , while Gumbel was taping an outdoor interview at Rockefeller Center ' s Prometheus Fountain , Letterman spotted him from his sixth-floor office window . Seizing a bullhorn ( one of many toys never far from Letterman ' s hand ) , he disrupted the taping with taunts and wisecracks . Gumbel reportedly had to be physically restrained in his urge to rearrange Letterman ' s facial furniture and , ever since then , Letterman has gibed him mercilessly on the air . So , would Gumbel be willing to patch things up by going on Letterman ' s show or by having Letterman on " Today ? " " No and no , " Gumbel said . " If I were a smart person , I ' d say ' No comment ' and pass on this because it winds up looking like I think of him and talk about him , when , in point of fact , I don ' t unless someone asks me . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a ' mea culpa ' on the air , " he said . " But I would have thought he would have been enough of a man to pick up the phone , privately , and say , ' I ' m sorry . ' That hasn ' t happened , and the fact that it hasn ' t happened tells me a lot about the guy . " Gumbel , who has been taking time away from " Today " to work on the network ' s exhaustive preparations for coverage of the Olympics , which start Sept. 17 and end Oct. 3 , said he ' s already sick of the subject . " I ' m meetinged out ; I ' m read out ; I ' m toured out ; I ' m talked out , " he said . " Come Oct. 3 , I ' ll be real thrilled-and very drunk . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Bryant Gumbel .
