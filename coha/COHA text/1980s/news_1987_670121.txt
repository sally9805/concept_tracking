COLUMBUS , Ohio  --  Honda Motor Co. said it will boost engine production capacity sixfold and start making transmissions , suspension assemblies and brakes in the U.S. , making it the first Japanese auto maker to build all of the major parts for its cars in the U.S. While Honda already assembles cars in the U.S. , it imports most of the parts from Japan . The new operations , which will be part of a $450 million expansion of Honda ' s Anna , Ohio , engine plant , are the broadest U.S. manufacturing expansion to date by any Japanese auto maker . Honda also said that , effective March 1 , it will organize all of its North American operations under a new company , Honda North America Inc. , which will chart Honda ' s strategy in this part of the world . Tetsuo Chino , 55 years old , senior managing director of Honda Motor Co. and president of its U.S. sales arm , American Honda Motor Co. , will assume the additional responsibilities of president of the Torrance , Calif. , umbrella company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations for Honda . Honda ' s planned expansion of manufacturing operations here marks the auto company ' s latest inroad into the lucrative North American market . It comes at a time when the strength of the Japanese yen has made it as cost-efficient for manufacturers to build in the U.S. as to import parts and finished vehicles from Japan . Already , Honda is building its Civic and Accord cars and its Gold Wing motorcycles at plants in Marysville , Ohio . And in September , Honda started making engines for its Civics at the Anna plant , which opened in 1985 . Until September , the plant had made motorcycle engines . Honda ' s announcement , made late last night both here and in Japan , also may help the company battle growing protectionist sentiment in Congress . Though the list of so-called Japanese " transplant " companies assembling cars in the U.S. is growing , the United Auto Workers union and others have complained that labor-intensive parts , such as engines , are still built in Japan and then shipped to the U.S. for final assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost local content for its cars built in Ohio to at least 66% by 1990 from the current 50% , including labor . The company was quick to note the political significance of this . Noboru Okamura , Honda ' s chairman , said in a statement that the new operation represents " another major step in Honda ' s endeavors to make the cars built in Marysville truly American products . " Expansion of engine production at Anna wasn ' t totally unexpected , since Honda has been boosting auto assembly here and has said it is studying the possibility of further increases . The dimension of the new operations at Anna , however , reflect how important the U.S. market is to Honda and how aggressively it plans to pursue its position here . In 1986 , Honda sold more cars in the U.S. than it did in Japan . Michael Luckey , an auto analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. , said he believes the expansion " will turn out to be a good move on ( Honda ' s ) part  --  both from a political as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the new operations also reflect its strategy of building products where it sells them . The company currently has capacity to build about 60 , 000 engines at Anna for the Civic subcompacts it makes in Ohio . Honda said that by 1991 it expects to be making 360 , 000 engines at the plant for the Civics , Accords and motorcycles it builds in Ohio . The expansion will create about 800 jobs and will add to , rather than replace , Honda ' s world-wide engine-production capacity . Of the 693 , 515 cars Honda sold in the U.S. last year , about one-third of them were built in Marysville . The company said it will build 320 , 000 cars in Marysville this year and 360 , 000 cars in 1988 . Honda also recently started building Accords at a new plant in Ontario . The company ' s cars have been selling strongly in the U.S. and any additional production in the future is likely to be welcomed by dealers . Honda had a five-day supply of inventory Dec. 1 , according to Automotive News , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered normal . Any addition to Honda ' s U.S. car production in the future would also allow the company to skirt the voluntary restraints that currently put a quota on the number of cars Honda and the other Japanese auto makers can import into the U.S. Still , the company is expanding its operations here at a time when the U.S. market is growing increasingly competitive . Several Japanese auto makers , including Toyota Motor Corp . , Mazda Motor Corp . , Mitsubishi Motors Corp . , Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Izusu Motors Co. , are either expanding or building new capacity in the U.S. Separately , Honda said it is projecting 1987 sales of 750 , 000 cars in the U.S. and 550 , 000 cars in Japan . In 1986 , the company sold about 500 , 000 cars in Japan . Honda also said it plans this year to start exporting Accords from Marysville to Taiwan .
