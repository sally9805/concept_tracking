For years , and for most of them it seemed like their careers , the Kansas City Royals lived with the curse of the Yankees . It had been there - in 1976 , 1977 , 1978 - stamped across their collective forehead until the best player in baseball , George Brett , stuck it under a seat in the second row of the third deck . In a confrontation Rich Gossage called " the best against the best , " Brett smashed an awesome , towering three-run homer into that second row , third deck , in the seventh inning last night . Combined with the heroics of Frank White , U.L. Washington and Dan Quisenberry , it brought Kansas City , Mo. , its first American League pennant . The final spike through the Yankees and their curse was a 4-2 victory that their children will be telling their grandchildren about in the year 2025 . " It had to be the Yankees and it had to be here , " said Brett after theRoyals completed a three-game playoff series sweep . " If we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the same to the people of Kansas City . We ' d all been through so much before . We ' d all thought so much about it . But it ' s all in the past now , friend , because the Royals have won the pennant . " The final blow to George Steinbrenner ' s empire - and Mr. Bluster was reserved afterwards , giving no indication whether or not he ' d fire Dick Howser all the way to Yawkey way - came in the seventh inning . The Yankees had a 2-1 lead . Series MVP Frank White ( 6 for 11 , a myriad of great defensive plays ) had homered off Tommy John in the fifth , but a bizarre White error and Rick Cerone single off Quisenberry , who had relieved Paul Splittorff , in the sixth had given the Yankees their two runs . With two outs and none on , Willie Wilson had doubled into the right-field corner , and Howser went to Gossage for the first time since last Saturday ' s divisional clincher . John thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ( 32- minute ) rain delay or anything to do with John , " said Howser . " I wanted Gossage against Washington . He ' s much more dangerous righthanded . All he can do lefty against that fastball is put the ball in play and run . Unfortunately , that ' s what he did . " The key to Game 2 had been White ' s battling Rudy May from 0-and- 2 for the hit that began the winning rally , and the key to The End was Washington . " I just beat it and dashed , " said U.L. , an 80-foot chopper over the mound that Willie Randolph got and threw quickly . . . but a hair late . " I always get the semi-big hit to leave it up to George , " he smiled , his toothpick rolling around in his mouth . " I felt great , " said Gossage . " I had a good fastball . I was just trying to get a strike . " Howser said , " We ' d been trying to pitch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " But Gossage admitted , " It was in and right down the middle . I ' m the best , he ' s the best . He beat me . I will never get beaten by a better player . " As he said it , his eyes red and sore , Bucky Dent reached through the writers , shook his hand and wished him a good winter . " With that fence 309 feet away , I was just trying to pull it 310 feet , " said Brett . " I can hit a fastball off anyone - at least I ' d like to think that . " Second row , third deck . " When I saw it , I thought we were on our way to the World Series , " said manager Jim Frey , who won in his first year . But that wasn ' t it . Frey had been second-guessed for bringing in Quisenberry in the sixth . In the eighth , Bob Watson tripled , and with two strikes on Reggie Jackson , Quisenberry lost his control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded , and Cerone had a 1-0 count . " I stuck with him because he ' s been put into that kind of spot all season , " said Frey . Quisenberry got a strike , then Cerone hit a vicious liner to Washington ' s right . He reached , stabbed it , looked around and found Jackson , wandering , lost , blundering . Double-play grounder . Inning over . Jackson did not have an RBI and stranded seven runnners in three games . And so Dan Quisenberry , the funny-looking little person whose name suggests a Baskin-Robbins flavor and whose delivery suggests Candlepins for Cash , had beaten Gossage . Mark Littell ' s name had finally been forgotten . " You always heard guys talk about the Yankee thing here , " said Kemer Brett . " If we ' d have lost tonight , that ' s all youu would have heard . " He leaned over and grabbed a champagne bottle from Jamie Quirk ' s hand and took a swig . The best player in baseball had stuck the curse of the Yankees under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Kansas CityRoyals had won the pennant .
