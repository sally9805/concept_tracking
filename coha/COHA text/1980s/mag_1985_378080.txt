The approaching holiday season holds little joy for thousands of employees and executives in the semiconductor industry . This year major makers of the tiny electronic wafers , which are the raw material of the high-technology age and run everything from watches to supercomputers , are playing the role of the Grinch . They will shut their doors for up to three weeks next month , a time when workers normally expect year-end bonuses and office celebrations . The painful closings are only the latest steps that chip producers are taking to cope with a slump that has crippled the once booming high-tech industry . " There 's no end in sight , " says Richard Billy , an analyst with the Gartner Group , a computer-research firm . " The bloodbath will continue . " <P> The downturn already rivals the depressions that have struck car-and steelmakers in recent years . Some 64,000 semiconductor employees have been laid off in the past ten months , a toll that equals 19% of the industry 's U.S. work force . The top five chip producers , including Intel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $195 million in the quarter ending in September , and the red ink keeps flowing . <P> While the semiconductor slump is centered in Silicon Valley , the industry 's hub , it extends well beyond that California region . United Technologies said last month that it was permanently closing its Mostek subsidiary in suburban Dallas and laying off 2,500 workers in Texas and 3,200 worldwide . The decision followed more than a year of intense and often agonizing cost cutting . Said Marie Gentilo , 45 , a Mostek quality-control worker : " There is nothing for us . Some of us are too old to get new jobs . " <P> Texas Instruments , Mostek 's Dallas neighbor , has also been suffering . TI said last month that it was closing plants in Houston and College Station , Texas , as well as El Salvador , and would lay off 2,200 workers and defer wage increases planned for the first half of 1986 . The job cutbacks brought the company 's layoffs to 7,000 this year . <P> Indeed , the slow growth of the computer market has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hastily built new plants and hired workers after personal computers , which are major users of semiconductors , became best sellers in 1983 . But the popularity of desktop machines has so far failed to grow at the euphoric rate that experts predicted . Instead of doubling , personal-computer sales will do well to rise by 30% in 1985 . That slower than anticipated growth , combined with weak demand for other types of computers , has contributed to a sharp drop in semiconductor prices . Result : worldwide chip revenues have fallen from $26 billion in 1984 to an estimated $21.6 billion this year . <P> While chip sales were sinking , U.S. firms continued to lose ground to the Japanese . Rather than cutting back production , such companies as Hitachi and Toshiba persisted in selling at falling prices to boost their market share . " The Japanese do n't throw in the towel on the downturns , " says Lane Mason , an analyst for Dataquest , which studies electronics firms . " They are willing to suffer a little more red ink in the short term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
