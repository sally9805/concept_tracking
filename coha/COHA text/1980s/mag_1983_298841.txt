A new chain counts calories <P> Every day some 40 million Americans , stricken by such cravings as the Big Mac attack and the Whopper whim , happily surrender to the artery-clogging , waist-expanding pleasures of fast food . But for diet-conscious consumers in particular , a megaburger binge provokes guilt feelings . Reason : the grab-a-bite meal of a quarter-pound cheeseburger , French fries and 16-oz. cola typically contains 1,070 calories . Since an average 170-lb. officeworker must consume fewer than 2,900 calories a day in order to lose weight , a trip to the burger stand does not leave much room for breakfast and dinner . <P> Knoxville , Tenn. , Businessman Doug Sheley , 36 , saw opportunity in the gap between fitness and fast food in 1978 , when he owned 18 Wendy 's restaurants and a share in a health club . Recalls Sheley : " Every time I walked into the club , somebody would say , ' How many calories in your Frosty , Doug ? ' " Sheley , a former small-college football player who had begun to put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McHealth food . Three years later , he opened the first D'Lites restaurant , his prototype for a chain serving familiar road food with reduced calories . Now he has begun to franchise the idea , aiming to bring a less fattening burger to towns all over the U.S. <P> The first three D'Lites restaurants , all in Atlanta , are averaging annual sales of more than $1 million each , compared with about $850,000 for the standard U.S. chain eatery . Their initial success has prompted 2,000 applications to build D'Lites stores . Since April , Sheley has sold 500 of the franchises for from $15,000 and $25,000 each in such cities as Chicago , Kansas City and Miami ; the first outlet opens this week in Charlotte , N.C. Because Sheley wants to keep a close watch on the chain 's growth , the number of D'Lites allowed to start up in the next year will be held to about 50 . <P> Sheley 's menu displays some ingenious slimming down .

Even the cheeseburgers are lightweights , comprising a bun with 25% fewer calories , low-fat hamburger patties and diet cheese . Other offerings include salads ( with low-cal dressing ) , soup , frozen yogurt , cheese-covered potato skins , and light beer . The company 's slogan consciously echoes the advertising for Miller Lite : " More of a good thing . And less . " <P> Other chains , including Burger King and Arby 's , have already begun appealing to fitness buffs by supplementing their beefy menus with salad bars and chicken sandwiches . But Sheley thinks D'Lites will be different because he designed everything with lightness in mind . His shops give an impression of upscale airiness , with their blond-wood exteriors and glass skylights . The interiors suggest a greenhouse , complete with hanging plants , brass fixtures and etched-glass partitions . Says Sheley : " I wanted to be the first chain to offer a full-range menu in a place that does n't look plastic . "                 @ @ @ @
