For more than a month , the questions and rumors have been piling up like snow flurries around the red-brown walls of the Kremlin . Where is Konstantin Chernenko , who was last seen on Dec. 27 , handing out awards at a televised ceremony ? How sick is he ? Is the frail Soviet party leader and President , who suffers from a pulmonary disorder , dying ? Is he about to resign ? Above all , who will succeed him ? <P> The mystery of the missing General Secretary of the Communist Party intensified last week . In Moscow , Politburo Member Mikhail Gorbachev , 53 , viewed by many as the heir apparent to the leadership , canceled a trip to Paris , where he had been expected to attend the 25th congress of the French Communist Party . Two weeks earlier , the Kremlin had announced that a conference of Warsaw Pact leaders , set for mid-January , had been postponed . In Bonn , West German Socialist Leader Willy Brandt announced that a visit to the Soviet capital in mid-February had also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate of uncertainty in Moscow that foreign diplomats and journalists became nervous every time the radio broadcast somber symphonic music , frequently the first indication of a top leader 's death . There were other signs and portents as well for Kremlin watchers : at week 's end , for example , the long-running world chess match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov was abruptly moved out of the House of Unions , the elegant building where Soviet leaders traditionally lie in state . <P> All the frenetic activity might prove to be a futile exercise . Chernenko could reappear in public at any moment , or be seen on Soviet TV . But even if the General Secretary resurfaces soon , it is apparent that the Soviet regime is once again face to face with one of its fundamental shortcomings : the lack of institutional means to ensure the orderly transfer of power . Given Chernenko 's age and evident frailty , the Soviet Union may in any event soon be undergoing its third leadership succession since 1982 . Indeed , Soviet analysts around the world are busy trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With speculation about Chernenko running wild , Soviet officialdom finally took a clumsy hand . Last Thursday , Stuart Loory , the Moscow-based American correspondent for Cable News Network , was summoned to the press department of Moscow 's Foreign Ministry , where Official Spokesman Vladimir Lomeiko handed him typewritten answers to four questions on U.S.-Soviet arms-control negotiations that Loory had submitted to Chernenko on Jan. 9 . The unsigned document , Loory was told , came from the Soviet leader himself . It reiterated standard Soviet positions : " serious and purposeful " discussions with the U.S. about nuclear-arms reductions were possible , but only if tied to restrictions on the Reagan Administration 's Star Wars space-based missile defense . Then the conversation turned to the question of Chernenko 's health , with Lomeiko assuring Loory that the Soviet leader would be back at work . <P> Lomeiko specifically knocked down speculation that Chernenko might resign at a Central Committee meeting , possibly next month . When Loory asked whether Chernenko was seriously ill , Lomeiko denied it point-blank . Said he : " All Politburo members are entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking his . " Where ? Somewhere outside Moscow .
