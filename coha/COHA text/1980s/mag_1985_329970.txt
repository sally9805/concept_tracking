They converged in the bleak scrublands of southeastern Angola . Rebel Leader Jonas Savimbi played host to the others : spokesmen for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force , the Afghan mujahedin and the hill tribes opposing the Communist regime in Laos . For two days they talked and socialized in Jamba , stronghold of Savimbi 's well-armed and organized movement against Angola 's Marxist government , and stood shoulder to shoulder with the American who had brought them together : Lewis Lehrman , millionaire Republican leader of a lobby called Citizens for America . The group announced the formation of an alliance , Democratic International , to support " the fight for independence from Soviet colonialism . " <P> The catalyst of the new alliance had even larger purposes in mind . The growth of anti-Soviet guerrilla movements , said Lehrman , is part of " the second stage of the American Revolution , ( which was ) always intended by the founders to be a world revolution . " Lehrman dramatized his notion by presenting each of the four rebel leaders with a copy of the U.S. Declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words from President Reagan : " Around the world we see people joining together . . . to free their nations from outside domination and an alien ideology . . . Their goals are % our goals . " Lehrman did not point out that this letter was not from Reagan to the new allies , but from Reagan to " Dear Lew . " <P> Some governments affected by the rebel movements were even more cautious than Reagan . Pakistan blocked Afghan rebel leaders from traveling to the meeting from Pakistani base camps . Mujahedin Colonel Ghulam Wardak flew to Africa from Washington , where he is recovering from battle wounds . Nervous Thai authorities , according to a Lehrman aide , created " tremendous problems " before allowing Laotian Guerrilla Leader Pa Kao Her to fly to the conference from Bangkok . But South Africa , which supports Savimbi , allowed participants to fly from Johannesburg . <P> The rebel leaders professed a common goal , and agreed to exchange intelligence and advisers . Although all are against the Soviets , the four could not express an anti-Communist stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan are supported by Communist China . The likely next step will be the opening of a Democratic International office in Washington . Upshot : a new lobby to urge Congress to support the Nicaraguan contras and other anti-Communist guerrillas .
