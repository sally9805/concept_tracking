Jerry Rawlings returns <P> With the help of the armed forces , former Flight Lieut . Jerry Rawlings , 34 , was in power in Ghana last week for the second time in 2 years . Rawlings overthrew the government of President Hilla Limann , 47 , in whose favor he had withdrawn in September 1979 . The dashing Rawlings , son of a Scottish father and a Ghanaian mother , had seized command , he declared , because the previous government was led by " a pack of criminals " who were taking the West African nation " down to total economic ruin .

Ghana has always held a special place in the hearts of African nationalists : it was the first of the black African colonies to become independent , and it was led by the eloquent and audacious Kwame Nkrumah . Ghana ( pop . 11.5 million ) has remained one of the world 's largest cocoa producers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 . <P> When Rawlings first took power in 1979 , he quickly executed eight high-ranking officers , including three former heads of state . During the four months of his " moral revolution , " other military men were convicted by secret " people 's courts , " merchants were caned in public for hoarding and officials were jailed on corruption charges . Still , Rawlings permitted free elections and allowed Limann , a little-known diplomat , to take office . <P> But Limann was unable to cope with the country 's chronic economic problems , aggravated by world inflation , rising fuel prices and overspending by previous regimes . On seizing power last week , Rawlings vowed to wage a " holy war " against corruption . Judged by his record , it is likely to be a bloody one .
