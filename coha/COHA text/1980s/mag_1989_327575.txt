For a weekend Japan mourned the late Emperor Hirohito . But by Monday morning it was business as usual . Proving that few events , not even the death of an imperial leader who reigned for more than six decades , can turn off their entrepreneurial juices for long , eager businessmen besieged a Justice Ministry office to stake claim to use of the word Heisei ( achieving universal peace ) , the name chosen to designate Emperor Akihito 's reign . On Monday the Tokyo Stock Exchange 's Nikkei average climbed to 31,006.51 , an all-time high . <P> Akihito too took up his imperial duties . Dressed in a morning coat , he gave an audience to 243 government officials and their spouses . Speaking in ordinary Japanese rather than the stylized court language favored by his father at his accession , Akihito promised to follow Japan 's 1947 democratic constitution . <P> The audience was just one of 20 ceremonies leading to Hirohito 's state funeral on Feb. 24 . That rite has provoked some consternation abroad , as more than 100 nations decide who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during World War II or suffered savage casualties in Japanese prison camps , the choice is by no means simple , even 45 years later . They must weigh the political cost of offending veterans against the damage that could result from bruising the sensitivities of a country that plays a commanding role in the world economy . <P> The selection of a funeral delegation touched a nerve in the Netherlands , which lost 30,000 people as a result of the Japanese occupation of the former Dutch East Indies , now Indonesia . Veterans groups are demanding that the delegation leader rank no higher than ambassador . China , overrun and occupied by the Japanese for nearly a decade , put off naming a delegation , but officials there say top leaders will not go to Tokyo . <P> A fierce battle raged in Australia , where some veterans groups denounced Hirohito as the " biggest war criminal on earth . " Said Bruce Ruxton , Victorian president of the Returned Services League : " Going to his funeral would be like going to the funeral of the devil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol , which does not usually require the Australian head of government to attend the funeral of a head of state . <P> Britain sought to straddle the divide by naming Prince Philip , who as a naval lieutenant accompanied his uncle Lord Mountbatten to the Japanese surrender ceremonies in 1945 . Philip 's war credentials partly defused the issue , but the president of the National Federation of Far Eastern Prisoners of War Association , Harold Payne , reportedly said Mountbatten " would turn in his grave " if he knew of the Prince Consort 's plans . Likely to roil the waters further is an upcoming BBC documentary contending that Hirohito must have known of the 1937 rape of Nanking , in which Japanese troops butchered at least 20,000 Chinese , and that he knew at least a month beforehand of the plan to attack Pearl Harbor .
