Congress has been unable to find a politically palatable way to provide health insurance to those who don ' t get it on the job and can ' t afford to buy . So now the states are beginning to try . But one governor who offered a far-reaching solution  --  Michael S. Dukakis in Massachusetts  --  is discovering how tough this problem can be . A coalition of supporters he had pieced together fell apart within days , and now his sweeping plan is languishing in the Legislature . At least half a dozen other states from Arizona to Michigan are experimenting cautiously with programs that range from helping small businesses buy policies to using state funds to subsidize policies for the working poor . " The federal government has dragged its feet for so long that the states have no choice but to get involved , " says Rep. John Antaramian , a Wisconsin legislator . Yet in his state , the governor recently vetoed several pilot programs the Legislature adopted . In Massachusetts , Gov . Dukakis last month proposed a bill that would force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance for nearly all employees . A new state agency would cover the unemployed and anyone else without insurance . " It ' s high time that at least one state in the nation does now what someday all will do , " he told a legislative committee . At first , most of the relevant interest groups , except the hospitals and small business lobbyists , applauded . But in a telling illustration of the complexity of the problem and the cost of solving it , the coalition quickly fell apart . This week , the state House of Representatives voted 146-1 to send the bill back to committee , where it ' s likely to stay for a while . " They moved too quickly and with inadequate facts , " says John Crozier , an influential lobbyist for the Massachusetts Business Roundtable . Today , most American workers and their families get health insurance through employers . The elderly get basic coverage from the federal Medicare program . And the very poor get theirs from a joint federal-state program called Medicaid . But between 30 million and 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t any health insurance at all . They rely on the charity of doctors , health centers and hospitals , which generally cover the cost by charging other patients a little extra . Now , that approach is crumbling . " Our system thrust indigent patients into the status of health-care beggars , " says Uwe Reinhart , a Princeton University economist . " It forced on hospitals the unwanted task of collecting hidden taxes . The cost of indigent care was stuck willy-nilly onto the tail of paying patients or their insurers and employers . " Today , many employers are shopping around for health care , deliberately fostering competition . " When you have price competition , then the hidden subsidies get squeezed out , " Mr. Reinhart says . " You can ' t expect hospitals to sell in a price-competitive market and at the same time render unrequited tender loving care . " An estimated 70% of the uninsured are workers , or dependents of workers , whose employers don ' t offer any health insurance . Consquently , most legislation aims at those companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress to require all employers to offer basic health insurance , but health-care lobbyists in Washington say the chances of passage appear slim . Enter the states . Hawaii was a pioneer . Thirteen years ago , it required employers to provide health insurance to anyone who works more than 20 hours a week . " Although the small employers may complain that there ' s some inequity . . . employers have accepted it now , " says Tomio Anzai , who enforces the law for the state . No state besides Massachusetts has seriously considered the Hawaii approach . For one thing , federal law prevents states from requiring employers to offer insurance . Hawaii has an exemption , and Massachusetts was planning to seek one . Instead , states are using the carrot instead of the stick , hoping to entice employers to offer health insurance . Oregon , for instance , next year will begin selling health insurance to small businesses with fewer than 25 employees , and will give businesses a state tax credit of 50% of the monthly premium , as much as $50 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses coverage from health plans that currently cover the poor under the state Medicaid program . Assisted by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , the state is picking up the administrative costs , but it isn ' t subsidizing the premiums . " The great unknown is : Are people going to pay for it if they can get it ? " says Gail Silverstein , director of the Arizona experiment . Michigan , with backing from the same foundation , next year will begin to sell coverage to people who leave the welfare rolls for a job that doesn ' t offer insurance . The state , the employer and the employee will share the cost equally . " Of those welfare recipients who lost their jobs and came back onto assistance , 80% were on jobs without health insurance , " says Vern Smith , policy director for Michigan Medicaid . He suspects some quit their jobs when someone in the family gets sick so they can get the medical benefits that accompany welfare . Legislators in Washington state , who have been rejecting various proposals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot program that is attracting widespread attention . The state will spend about $19 million in the next two years to sell subsidized health insurance to families with income below 200% of the poverty line , or , for example , $22 , 400 for a family of four . Families will pay monthly premiums as low as $10 a person , depending on their income . " We ' ve had a shift from an industry base where ( United Auto Workers founder ) Walter Reuther and others got coverage for workers to service industries where workers aren ' t unionized and don ' t have ' bennies ' . . . and are at a wage level where the cost of buying coverage is prohibitive , " says Featherstone Reid , counsel to the Senate Ways and Means Committee in Washington state . Although the program is limited to 40 , 000 people for the first four years , about 420 , 000 people , or nearly 10% of the state ' s population , will be eligible if the program goes statewide , he says . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . All at once , it would have given health insurance to about 600 , 000 uninsured people , 12% of the population . " A comprehensive approach is the way to go , " says Susan Sherry , director of the Massachusetts Health Action Alliance , a coalition of consumer groups . " When you try to tinker  --  if you only deal with people under 200% of the poverty line or only pregnant women or only children  --  the problem just pops out somewhere else . " The latest version of the Dukakis proposal would require employers to offer health insurance to anyone who works more than 25 hours a week . Employers would have to pay at least 80% of the premium for a basic health-insurance plan , but only 50% if they offer better benefits . Employers would have to pick up the entire premium for workers earning less than $4. 19 an hour . Only companies less than three years old would be exempted . ( If Congress won ' t grant the state an exemption that allows the state to do this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t offer insurance and use that money to buy coverage . ) A surcharge on hospital bills and a modest payroll tax  --  as much as $18. 20 per employee per year  --  would finance care for the unemployed and anyone not covered by existing government programs . The Dukakis administration estimates the cost of its plan to employers and taxpayers at about $650 million , substantially more than the $330 million currently raised by a surcharge on hospital bills to cover so-called free care provided by hospitals . Critics say the governor ' s estimate is far too low . At first , the loudest objections to the governor ' s bill came from small businesses and from hospitals , which said the governor ' s cost-containment proposals were too stingy . Eventually , the Legislature bowed to the hospitals ' complaints , allowing hospitals to take in far more money than current state regulations allow . That made business lobbyists even more determined to kill the bill . " The passage of the ( governor ' s ) bill is the equivalent of passing the Social Security Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce . " We were looking seriously at the plan because we felt the time had come to give relief to all those employers who give coverage to their employees and pick up the cost of the uninsured , " says Richard Mastrangelo , general counsel of Associated Industries of Massachusetts . But in the end , his group and others concluded that the plan was simply too costly  --  and many legislators agreed . Despite the setbacks in the Legislature , efforts to find some sort of acceptable solution continue in Massachusetts . " Nobody wins the way we are now , " Mr. Crozier of the Business Roundtable said yesterday . " We still have a cost-containment problem and we still have an uninsured problem . " Gov . Dukakis , who had been hoping to cite the program in his presidential campaign , says he will keep pushing . After all , a non-binding state referendum item calling for national health insurance drew more than one million votes last year , 67% of those who voted . " There ' s no question , " the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commonwealth support health insurance for everyone . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
