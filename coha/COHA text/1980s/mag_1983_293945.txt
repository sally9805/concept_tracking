Number , Please <P> To the Editors : <P> TIME 's report on the breakup of A T &; T Nov. 21 describes the consequences of a crusade by overzealous bureaucrats and overprotective courts . Confusion and higher rates will be the result . To the bureaucrats who forced this situation on us , I wish skyrocketing telephone bills and lots of wrong numbers . <P> Godfrey M. Elliott Sarasota , Fla . <P> We should never have allowed A T &; T to be split up . The company was highly successful , and its services were well worth the nominal charge . <P> Scott Morrison an Mateo , Calif . <P> What irony . The judiciary orders the breakup of A T &; T , a company providing the best telephone service in the world . Only in America ! <P> Penny M. Johnson Racine , Wis . <P> It is a sad day when the competition and the courts dismantle a company that has provided efficient and progressive phone service . The antiquated postal system should have been broken up instead . <P> Don E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any winners in the split-up of A T &; T , they are not the customers . As anyone who has lived abroad knows , the U.S. has had the best and most reasonable telephone service in the world . The Government should have heeded the old saying " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . " <P> Barnett K. Johnson Gumming , Ga . <P> <P> P.L.O . Civil War <P> The battle for supremacy in the Palestine Liberation Organization Nov. 21 is not a fight over who will better the lot of the Palestinian refugees . It is a struggle for political and personal power . The Palestinians are a symbol , and their worth increases with their sufferings . The P.L.O . leaders know that solving the Palestinian problem would benefit only Israel and the refugees . <P> Sherif Laoun Montreal <P> The P.L.O . is the only organization that elects its chairman by waging war in someone else 's country . <P> Dale H. Wallace Lewisburg , Pa . <P> The events in Lebanon reveal hypocrisy and a lust for power . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as their Arab " brothers , " are now facing a situation similar to that of the Jews in the 1930s and 1940s in Germany . As then , the world mouths pious rhetoric but does nothing . <P> Michael Kaplan Oceanside , N. Y. <P> <P> Unpunished Terrorists <P> The U.S. 's failure to respond to suicide attacks against our troops in Lebanon Nov. 21 is in sharp contrast to the Israeli reaction , which was to bomb suspected terrorist bases in the Bekaa Valley . It is no surprise that Captain George Tsantes was murdered in Athens . Do terrorists now believe that U.S. citizens can be attacked with impunity ? <P> Bruce J. Friedman Philadelphia <P> No act of retaliation can bring back the dead . Getting even would only follow the Middle East 's tradition of an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . <P> Moxie S. George Captain , U.S.M.C. Reserve and Jan Winter Santa Barbara , Calif . <P> <P> Capitol Bombing <P> In a country like ours , where freedom of expression is a basic right , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov. 21 .
