' ' I ' ve been to the Soviet Union twice and enjoyed it very much , ' ' says Ruiko , a Japanese homemaker , as she shows off her Russian doll collection and other souvenirs . ' ' The Soviet people were extremely friendly . Life there is bright and happy. ' ' // // Both Ruiko and her husband Tohru have traveled to the Soviet Union on subsidized tours sponsored by a Japanese-Soviet friendship society , and both have come home with positive impressions of Japan ' s northern neighbor . This sort of cultural exchange is just one example of growing Soviet-Japanese personal contacts , focused primarily on the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido. // Hokkaido is situated in a strategically sensitive area for the Soviets - just across a narrow strait from the Soviet Union ' s Sakhalin Island , near which Korean Airlines Flight 7 was shot down two years ago by a Soviet interceptor. // Although Soviet foreign policy in Asia is often characterized as clumsy , the Soviets are waging a subtle and sometimes effective propaganda effort in Hokkaido . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . Some analysts say that these efforts may be stepped up under the more polished leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev. // Hokkaido is considered a backwater by the rest of Japan - geographically , politically , and commercially . Not colonized until the late 19th century , the island ' s attempts to catch up with the rest of Japan have failed to bear fruit . In spite of central-government subsidies to attract industries there , major firms have been reluctant to move so far from Japan ' s commercial and industrial center along the Tokyo-Osaka coastal corridor . This has led to an image problem for Hokkaido - one difficult for the government to fix . The Soviet Union has been trying to use the problem to create direct ties between itself and Hokkaido. // ' ' They want to have whatever levers of political influence they can get , ' ' says one high-level foreign diplomat . Soviet propaganda efforts appear to be aimed at eroding public support for US-Japanese military exercises , defusing territorial disputes , and isolating Hokkaido from the rest of Japan. // The stakes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straits through which Soviet warships and submarines must pass on their way to the Pacific Ocean from their bases in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk . One-third of Japan ' s self-defense forces are stationed in Hokkaido , and the island is the site of expanding US-Japanese joint military exercises. // Politically , Hokkaido has been the seat of the vocal ' ' Northern Territories ' ' movement , which seeks the return of several islands seized illegally by the Soviets at the end of World War II. // Hundreds of thousands of Japanese were expelled from territories occupied by the Soviets at the time ; many were resettled in Hokkaido . These people are among the most vocal supporters of the Northern Territories movement . But they are also among the most willing travelers to the USSR and see personal benefits in closer relations. // ' ' I would like to go back to visit because it ' s my family ' s home , ' ' says one Japanese who left Sakhalin with his family in 1948. // When they were forced out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Soviet Union has permitted limited access to Sakhalin and the disputed Northern Territories. // But such enticements appeal only to a shrinking number of older Japanese with direct links to the northern regions . An even more effective lever is cold cash - in the form of herring and salmon. // Hokkaido lies near some of the richest fishing grounds in the world . But with the imposition of 200-mile economic zones , Japanese fishermen have found themselves closed out of waters now claimed by the Soviet Union or forced to limit their catches in accord with quotas set by Moscow . Fishermen have been known to bribe Soviet coastal officials in order to gain access to the waters or to exceed quotas . Frequently , they simply take their chances by slipping into Soviet waters without permission. // One way the fishermen try to limit the risk of such activities is to join one of the several privately-funded , Japanese-Soviet ' ' friendship centers ' ' that dot Hokkaido . According to Morio Mizuno , managing director of the largest such center in Hokkaido , ' ' the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a friend of Japan. ' ' // The centers provide information about the USSR to the Japanese public and even help ease friction between Japanese fishermen and Soviet authorities . For example , the friendship center in Kushiro , on the Pacific coast of Hokkaido , attracts most of its members from the fishing community . ' ' It is said that if you join this friendship center , you get special treatment if you ever enter Soviet waters , ' ' says a high-level Japanese diplomat. // But it appears that Moscow ' s anticorruption campaign has hardened the hearts of the Soviet coast guard . Recently , fishermen in the Kushiro region were surprised when Soviet authorities handed down to friendship center members stiff fines for illegal fishing. // Sometimes , the economic motives behind loud exclamations of Japanese-Soviet friendship are even more obvious . Consider the case of Yasusaburo Shibano , founder and president of the Japanese-Soviet House of Friendship and Culture in Sapporo , opened in 1977 . Mr. Shibano also is founder of a Japanese-Soviet trading company. // According to one friendship-house publication , trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2. 75 million in 1972 to over $40 million in 1984. // ' ' Both sides are using each other , ' ' says Professor Hiroshi Kimura , an expert on Soviet foreign policy at Hokkaido University . He points out that while the Japanese gain trade and fishing privileges , the Russians get public relations mileage. // The centers play host to many activities : exhibitions touting the virtues of Soviet life , Soviet movies , Russian-language classes , and subsidized tours of the Soviet Union . Earlier this summer , a group of 30 Japanese youngsters attended a Young Pioneer summer camp in Siberia - under the auspices of a Japanese-Soviet friendship center. // // // //
