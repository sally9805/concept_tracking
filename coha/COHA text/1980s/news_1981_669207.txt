Other overtures for Asians to come in  --  or come back  --  are being heard elsewhere in East Africa . Kenya and TAnzania , for example , likewise now are turning to the once-maligned Asians for help in getting their troubled economies to function. // Farther south , in Malawi , Mozambique , Zimbabwe , and even white-ruled South AFrica , Asians still play an important role in the economic and business communities. // In uganda , President Obote already has broken with tradition by appointing a Uganda Asian , Shaffiq Arain , as high commissioner ( ambassador ) in London . That was because most of Uganda ' s asians joined the immigrant queue in London after they were expelled by former President Idi Amin in 1972. // Mr. Obote has also appointed a Uganda Asian as high commissioner in India . A british Foreighn Office minister , Richard Luce , who recently visited Mr. Obote in Kampala , told me that the Uganda leader wants the Asians to come back to inject their business and technical skills into the ailing Uganda economy. // It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential skills in many sectors apart from business . Included are the post office , the railways , the Ministry of Works , and other essential areas for where black Africans had enter for various reasons. // Mr. Obote also has encouraged the great Uganda Asian industrial dynasties , the MAdhavanis and the Mehtas , to rehabiliate their coffee , tea , and cotton estates . Where the madhvanis and the mehtas go , it was felt , others Would follow and are following. // One of the reasons for Uganda ' s great economic disaster under Idi Amin was his wholesale explusion of these industrious , skilled people . Some 30000 Asians left in 1972 . The Amin theory ( which proved incorrect ) was that black Africans could take over the Asian shops , businesses , and industries without any preparation or training . But most of the Asian businesses he gave to his friends , relations , and supporters , including many Army and Air Force officers , who put untrained and inexperienced blacks in managerial positions . Businesses are not run that way , Uganda quickly found. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Asians in compensation . Mr. Obote has accepted that obligation , but in the present state of the Uganda economy , he obviously can not pay up . Some returning Asians have waived compensation for the time being. // What of the rest of East Africa ? The election to parliament of Asian lawyer Krishna gautama by an almost all-black contituency caused a sensation in Kenya . That gave another lift to the Asians in Kenya , who for years had not been satisfied with their position as the least popular community in Kenya among the blacks . Ironically , the white Europeans  --  many of them ex-colonial settlers  --  had long been accepted in independent Kenya . The Asians first came to Kenya as merchants in the early 19th century to trade with the arabs along the arab-dominated east coast of Africa . Many prospered , built fine houses , founded wealthy families . In later days , thousands came as coolies , " brought by the british to build the railway from Mombasa , on the Indiana Ocean , to Uganda because it was believed they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished , many started shops and stores , with hundreds of Asian families establishing themselves in Nairobi when it was merely a construction point on the railway. // Nairobi ' s commercial and industrial life today is largely dominated by Asian businesses . Many have plunged into industry , and have become very wealthy indeed. // Many Asians went on to colonial Uganda with the railway , starting businesses and shops , becoming lawyers , accountants , or doctors . They became solid , reliable citizens , mostly eschewing politics , but many entering the civil service where they became valuable servants of government. // Some of the Asians who had to leave Uganda under Idi Amin were born there and accepted Uganda as their home . Not all went to Britain . Some went to Canada , others to India , and few stayed in Kenya to go into business. // Over the years , thousands of Asians went to Tanzania ( then Tanganyika ) where they founded businesses and worked in the civil service . But after President Julius nyerere brought in his socialist plans , many were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Asian communities right down the east coast of Africa , in Mozambique , Malawi , Zimbabwe , and in Natal , South Africa , where originally they were brought over from India by the British to work on the great sugar estates. // For years , Asians excited the envy and dislike of black Africans all over the East Africa . The " duka wallah " ( shopkeeper ) was often the only man in the village or on the farm who provided the commodities needed by the blacks : Sugar , salt , bread , groceries , milk , meat , and medicines . He gave credit and charged interest , sometimes extortionate . Some even loaned money. // In the old colonial color-bar pecking order , Asians were less touchable than the Europeans but more so than the Blacks . However , they were favored by the whites because of their skills and industry ; few businesses and trades did not have Asian managers , accountants , and " fundis " ( skilled men ) . Turbaned Sikhs worked as engineers and builders  --  and still do. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kenya and elsewhere in East AFrica . There were demands for their expulsion . Blacks wanted their businesses and for a time the Kenya government pursued a program of issuing quit notices against Asian shops , handing them over to black Africans , most of whom had no business experience . Some did well , but other quickly failed. // When Kenya became independent in 1963 , its first leader , President Jomo Kenyatta , genuinely wanted to make Kenya a multiracial state . He offered Asians and whites who wanted to remain in Kenya permanently a chance to become citizens . Some 60 , 000 Asians were accepted . The others retained British passports , with the understanding that they would leave Kenya under an agreed quota system with the British government. // Today there are at least 100 , 000 Asians in Kenya , integrated into the business life of the country . But one criticism of the Asian families , some of which are large , is their unwillingnes to integrate fully into the life of Africa for religious and racial reasons . Many also are ostentatious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrosanct , and intermarriage with the blacks is rare. // Now the wheel in Kenya and Uganda has gone full circle , and asians are not only being encouraged to come back with their money and skills , but in Kenya , Asian technicians in various skills are being imported from India  --  becoming a new race of expatriates. // India has helped to establish a number of big industries in Kenya  --  paper and textiles , for instance , which are run by Asians brought in with Indian capital to do the job . The huge Pan-African Paper Mill is entirely run by Indian technicians , with the proviso that they train black Africans to take over their jobs. // //
