What made the back-patting noteworthy was that no more than about 7,000 officers and enlisted men ever set foot on the tiny Caribbean island . <P> Those members of the 82nd Airborne Division who parachuted from helicopters as Grenadian soldiers fired at them from the ground were , quite rightly , granted medals . But so were a number of chairbound bureaucrats who got no closer to the fighting than an office in the Pentagon .
