A blooming new Bible market offers a confusion of choices <P> Every day the trucks pull up to the loading docks at Riverside Book and Bible Co. , tucked into the cornfields of Iowa Falls , Iowa , and haul away 40 tons of Bibles . Riverside , the nation 's biggest Bible wholesaler , enjoyed a 34% jump in sales last year , to $25 million . <P> It has always been a salesman 's maxim that Bibles are a recession-proof product , and , with America 's new turn to old-time religion , business is in full boom . Sales run to more than $150 million a year in the U.S. The industry is not only growing but evolving , from a steady but unglamorous trade to a high-pressure one . Verily , the Bible is in the process of becoming the greatest story ever sold . <P> Today there is a Bible for every taste-or lack thereof . For the Christian who has everything , Oxford Press offers the Washburn College Bible , a dressed-up King James Version with 66 full-color reproductions of masterpieces from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : $3,500 for a red leather-bound three-volume " limited edition " in a cloth-covered redwood case . A scaled-down one-volume slipcased trade version costs a mere $65 . ( Oxford 's cheapest King James is $12.50 . ) At the opposite end of the cultural scale . Scarf Press and David C. Cook have issued Bibles in comic-strip form . There are also vulgar paraphrases of the New Testament aimed at young " Jesus people , " as well as curious " chronological Bibles , " which purport to rearrange events in exact " historical " order . Reader ' s Digest is at work on a condensed Bible . By 1982 it will cut the Old and New Testaments nearly in half , by trimming out repetitions and wordiness rather than by chopping chapter and verse . <P> Even apart from such oddities , there is an unprecedented confusion of choices in standard full-length Bibles .

Its continuing popularity is due to familiarity , as well as richness of language . Also , many special study editions of the King James offer useful cross references , indexes , explanatory articles and other " helps .
