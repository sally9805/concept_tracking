UNIONDALE , N.Y . - The big brave words after a 3-3 road trip and consecutive victories over the two bottom teams in the league , may have sounded empty . Last night they rang true . The Bruins surely did pull together . They surely did work for each other . They played that kind of game against the Stanley Cup champion Islanders and came out of it with a 3-2 victory in a game that went down to the last split second , a game that was very important to the Bruins . Mike Bossy golfed a long shot from the left side that failed to beat the game-ending green light . That was after the Islanders had pulled their goalie with 1:02 to play . " Just as important as winning , " said Jean Ratelle , " was to play well . To play as as a team , everybody working and everybody working together . The only thing we didn ' t want was to be blown out . " " When we ' re playing like that the confidence factor in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night it was goalie Rogie Vachon who provided a certain , positive kind of confidence . He moved quickly and sharply all night , moving out of his goal all night , making one spectacular save after another and backboning the Bruins all night . It was a third-period goal by Ray Bourque that put the Bruins ahead , 3-2 , at 4:23 after they had come from behind twice with power- play goals by Peter McNab to get the 2-2 score . Bourque broke in from the left point to take a centering pass from Rick Middleton eight feet in front of goalie Billy Smith and he put the puck into the goal . The first period was scoreless - but not from lack of scoring chances . The Islanders had more threatening shots than the Bruins and Vachon was spectacular from the first minute to the last . Meanwhile , the Bruins had a strong forechecking game going for them and Smith was up to all their chances . His presence in the Islander goal was somewhat of a surprise because coach Al Arbour had alternated his goalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last game . Arbour , though , is fully aware of Smith ' s intensity against the Bruins . Vachon made two outstanding saves in the first minute on Anders Kallur and that set the rhythm for the Boston goalie . With the game less than two minutes old he added three more saves to his total , one of them a point-blank shotfrom the slot by sniper Bossy . His best , however , may have been one he made on Bryan Trottier with three minutes left in the period . Trottier was standing in front of the crease and a rebound came directly to him . Vachon was on him quickly to block the shot . While Vachon was keeping the goal empty , the Bruins killed off two penalties very effectively against the high-powered Islander power play . At the other end of the ice , the Bruins had some scoring chances of their own . The most frustrating ? A Dwight Foster shot that ran up Smith ' s stick and landed on top of the goal . Smith ' s best save was a left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal at the 16-minute mark . The goaltending in both nets was just as good in the second period , but the the shooters had their moments , with two power-play goals by McNab . Vachon , heeding the advice coach Gerry Cheevers gave him in Winnipeg last Monday , continued to come out of his goal challenging the shooters , but the Islanders finally broke through halfway through the second period . Wayne Merrick , no gunner , swung to the top of the right circle with the puck and put a shot past Vachon ' s right . The Bruins scrambled back and McNab ' s first goal of the game was a little strange . He shot out of the right circle and the puckwent off Steff Persson ' s stick and bounced through Smith ' s legs . In half-a- minute the Islanders went back in front on Kallur ' s 26th goal of the season . He was fed the puck by Butch Goring from behind the goal to the bottom of the left circle and he put a quick shot by Vachon . The Bruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the period . They were working on a power play and Middleton was able to feed the puck to McNab in the middle at the Islander blue line . McNab broke through two defensemen , almost stumbled in on Smith and then turned the puck to his backhand and put it past Smith ' s right . For the Bruins this was the kind of game they needed , astrong performance against the best team in the NHL.
