After six years of economic crisis , Mexico 's prospects finally seemed to brighten this year . The country 's stock market became the world 's fastest- rising exchange , as share prices climbed more than 649% during the first nine months of 1987 . The government 's foreign currency reserves swelled by 150% to a comfortable $17 billion , the highest level of any Latin American debtor country , and a surge of exports helped the Mexicans rack up a $6.6 billion trade surplus . <P> Now , just as suddenly as the financial picture turned sunny , it has clouded over again . Last week the Mexican peso began to gyrate wildly . By Friday its value had settled to about 2,700 pesos to a dollar , down 37% for the week . Supplies of dollars quickly ran out as Mexican citizens lined up at banks to change their pesos .

By last week , however , Mexican officials began to fear that they would come close to running out of greenbacks . If that happened , Mexico would be unable to pay interest on its foreign loans and obtain new credit from banks . Result : the government abruptly abandoned its support of the peso , sending the currency into a free fall . <P> Officials defended the strategy , saying they had acted decisively . But it is a gamble that could destroy what is left of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border who rely on Mexican patronage will probably experience reduced sales . Moreover , the falling peso will surely fan the country 's raging inflation . Prices are now rising at an annual rate of 141% , the highest level in Mexican history .
