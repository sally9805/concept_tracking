txt Airlines , trying to return to profitability , are ending certain 20% coach fare discounts , effective Friday . The third quarter , usually the strongest of the year for airlines , is the key as to whether the industry returns this year to profits after three consecutive years of operating losses . Since traffic has been improving for several months , the carriers are trying to temper fare cutting to post profits for a change . Eastern Airlines is going even further by raising fares 5% across the board , effective July 15 , and Republic Airlines said it will follow . Other leading carriers are studying Eastern 's action . Meanwhile , in the past week , several carriers ended so-called " M " coach fares , which are 80% of full coach , or " Y , " fares . The airlines are : United , a unit of UAL Inc. : American , a unit of AMR Corp. ; Trans World , a unit of Trans World Corp. ; USAir ; Delta ; Continental , a unit of Texas Air Corp. ; Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Piedmont . Only Pan American World Airways , among the major carriers , is n't joining the pattern except on a very selected basis . But It is raising some fares , effective Friday , such as the midweek fare from LaGuardia in New York to Miami to $139 from $99 . And smaller regional carriers such as Pacific Southwest Airlines , which did n't use the " M , " also have been raising fares . Pacific Southwest , a unit of PSA Inc. , raised its fares an average 8% June 16 . W.R. Howard , chairman of Winston-Salem , N.C.-based Piedmont , explained the trend : " Last year . two out of every three passengers flying on U.S. carriers flew at prices less than airline costs of producing the service . The industry just ca n't continue to sustain that type of fare structure . " So-called " M " fares ( the " M " does n't stand for anything ; it 's a designation ) were created by American in April as part of an attempt to simplify thousands of fares into four basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan Am and certain new carriers such as People Express and Midway , largely adopted the formula . Besides the " M " and " Y " fares , another type of fare , the " super saver , " continues largely intact as 50% off full coach fares . Super savers require seven-day advance purchase and usually certain periods of stay at the destination . First-class fares  --  a fourth type  --  remain unchanged . Airlines have dropped " M " selectively , with earners keeping it on certain routes if the competition , such as People Express , Midway , Southwest , or Air One , continues to offer low fares . Ozark , for example , is keeping " M " on some routes that Air One  --  a new career with business-class service at coach fares  --  flies . And Northwest , while abolishing " M " on most routes , is keeping it on competitive routes such as Minneapolis to Seattle . A spokesman for the Air Transport Association said airlines need higher fares to increase their " yields , " or revenue passenger mile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield for U.S. carriers was 11.76 cents in 1982. compared with 12.35 cents in 1981. which also was a poor year . The association says 78% of the revenue passenger miles flown in the U.S. last year was fare-discounted traffic , up from 71% in 1981 and 57% in 1980 . If the carriers ' firmer fares stick , the association predicts , U.S. airlines could have an operating profit of $200 million to $800 million this year , compared with an operating loss of $733 million in 1982 . Major airlines had an operating loss of $588 million in this year 's first quarter ? $27 million wider than the year-earlier operating loss  --  and analysts expect them to break even in the second quarter . So the carriers will need a robust operating profit for the third quarter to reach the association 's projection . Firmer fares are a " great idea , " says an airline spokeswoman .
