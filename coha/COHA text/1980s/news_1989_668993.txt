To some people , parks are just places for an occasional Sunday picnic . To Connie and Chester Dymek , parks are a way of life . Certainly , the Chicago Park District ' s Portage Park has always been a way of life for the Dymeks , who have lived near the park 20 years and have been active supporters of its programs . Dymek , who was born and reared in the Portage Park neighborhood , participated in park activities as a child . Typically , participants in park programs for children grow up to be park volunteers . Portage Park , which will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 1989 , has been kept in operation by successive generations of community residents . " We get the entire community involved in the park through community groups , " Connie Dymek says . " The families around here care about the park , and they aren ' t afraid to get their hands dirty to help keep it the way we want it . " We ' re lucky because children ( don ' t often ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The park keeps them off the street through a very good working staff and a variety of programs . " Both Dymeks contribute to those programs ' success . He is president of the Youth Football Committee , a group of parents who supervise and support the football teams , and she is president of the Portage Park Advisory Council , which advises the park district on the park ' s needs . They have two sons , 25 and 16 , and a daughter , 21 , who also have worked and played in Portage Park facilities most of their lives . The older son , Jay , was active in baseball , football , basketball and swimming programs in elementary school and returned to the park in high school to manage a football team . The daughter , Christine , a former member of a park cheerleader squad , became a cheerleader coach while in high school . The younger son , Craig , on a football team while in elementary school , is a junior football coach . " Our swimmers often come back as lifeguards or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants come back to work with the seniors . " Diane Devereaux , former supervisor of recreation , worked closely with the Dymeks throughout her five years at Portage . Now regional manager of the Lincoln Park complex , Devereaux recalls the couple in positive terms . She stressed that the park ' s success story owes much of its existence to loyal supporters such as the Dymeks . " The Dymeks are just wonderful . They are loyal and dedicated to Portage , and they can be called on in an instant , " she says . Mitchell Schulak , who replaced Devereaux after her promotion in October , agrees : " The Dymeks have just been tremendously helpful . They ' re intelligent and diplomatic as well as supportive , and Connie is a real powerhouse , especially in the area of securing funding for our immediate needs . " The needs can be pressing in a system as large and active as Portage . Schulak operates with a paid staff of about 30 , including maintenance personnel and program administrators . He can also rely on about 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 programs currently offered in general categories , such as sports , arts and crafts , exercise and social programs . These are further broken down according to age and ability . The programs serve more than 8 , 000 people annually , from toddlers to the elderly living primarily in the Portage Park and Irving Park neighborhoods , Schulak said . Among the more popular sports are football , baseball , basketball , swimming and gymnastics . In these areas there may be as many as 500 to 1 , 000 participants . The gymnastic and swimming teams have received many state and national awards , and the football and baseball teams are often division champions . A Portage Park football team plays in the North Suburban League , which encompasses mostly north and northwestern suburbs . Portage Park is the only city team in the league . Divisions are determined by players ' age and size . The Portage Park All-Star Youth Baseball Team won its division championship at the Sox Park City Tournament in 1987 . Portage Park comprises 39 acres . There are eight lighted tennis courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshoe pit and a picnic area . The play lot and athletic field were completely renovated last year , and the Dymeks were instrumental in both renovations . The lot was resurfaced for greater safety , and new equipment was installed , including swings , slides and climbing sculptures . " We were moving wood chips around for two or three days during the hottest part of last summer , " Mrs. Dymek recalls , " and we passed out dozens of ice buckets of lemonade . It was worth it . I ' ve never before seen the play lot used like it is now , and the little ones are just precious . They play on that equipment for hours . " The newly designed athletic field required even greater dedication , say the Dymeks and Schulak . " Let me tell you , it didn ' t just happen over night , " Mrs. Dymek says . " It was a long , long battle , but we finally have what we ' ve needed for so long . " It took more than 10 years to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are five playing fields-reduced from six for safety reasons-which have been completely overhauled , sodded , reseeded and pitched for proper drainage . A new sewer system also has been added . There are two main buildings . The field house , at 4100 N. Long Ave. , houses offices to accommodate the park district ' s regional staff and supplies . The craft center and a large meeting room , the home the Portage Park Senior Group and other social activities , also are in the field house . About half a block away is the gymnasium , which holds the Portage Park offices , an indoor pool and a basketball court . The pool and court are open year-round . Gymnastics classes , the wrestling team , a women ' s aerobics class and swimming teams work out there . There are also facilities for volleyball . The park was the site of swimming competition in the 1959 Pan American Games and the Olympic swimming trials in 1972 . Portage is particularly proud of its outdoor , Olympic-sized pool , built in 1959 for the Pan American Games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1972 swimming trials . " Portage is one of the oldest parks on the Northwest Side , " says Ken Nitsche , another old friend of the Dymeks . Nitsche was Area 10 supervisor for Portage Park-area parks for 10 years before becoming a regional manager at the Riis Park district just to the south . He has been with the Chicago Park District 31 years , and he was reared in the area and participated , at an earlier time , in many of the same programs as the Dymeks . " It ' s almost impossible to overestimate the influence the Dymeks have had at Portage , " he says . " You can ' t put your finger on a program they haven ' t had something to do with , and this has been true for many years . They ' re a positive influence on the children of the community , and when it comes to introducing new programs , they have amazing tenacity and determination . " That determination was evident in their participation in the athletic field renovation , the installation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered safety backup lighting for the indoor pool . The couple are working with other members of the advisory council and the community to introduce a running track in the park . The proposal is awaiting a decision by the Chicago Park District . The Dymeks consider their time and effort well spent . " Here , we love our children totally , and we feel they should have the same recreational opportunities we had , " Mrs. Dymek says . " We hope the same opportunities will be there for our grandchildren . " Thanks to their effort , they probably will be . " They ' re the glue that keeps everything together out here , " said Allen Ackermann , regional park supervisor.  --   --   --   --   --  For information on park activities , call park headquarters , 777-3660 .
