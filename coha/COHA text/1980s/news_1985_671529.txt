A tilted slab of earth jutting into nothingness suddenly splits apart along a silver-lined fissure the shape of a lightning bolt . Fog oozes out of the crevice , while huge , copper-hued boulders tumble in slow motion from the starry , graphite-black midnight sky above . And in the center of the apocalypse , apparently unperturbed by either the earthquake or the throbbing jungle cries accompanying it , is an elegantly dressed middle-aged woman ( Gaby Rodgers ) . Steadfastly holding her cloven ground , she aims a silver revolver in the vague direction of the audience. // Who is this woman ? Well , never mind . The point , we must assume , is the image , and the image is stunning . Mr. Wilson has few peers in the Western theater when it comes to fashioning memorable stage illusions . In " The Golden Windows , " he seems to bring Paul Delvaux canvases to life . While the earthquake may be the evening ' s piece de resistance , we also witness shooting stars , a celestial bonfire and a floating mermaid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At ground level , we find a strange sentry-like house whose door opens to reveal unexpected shafts of light and mysterious human mannequins . Eventually , a golden moon washes up on the beach like a melted Dali watch. // As I say , you ' ll enjoy the images of " The Golden Windows , " which is now playing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music ' s Next Wave Festival . Whether that enjoyment will sustain you for two intermissionless hours is another question . In the visionary theater of Mr. Wilson , we are not meant to look for meaning , let alone story , characters or psychological reality . We are asked , instead , to share a dream . But all dreams , Mr. Wilson ' s included , are not created equal . " The Golden Windows , " which was first produced in Munich in 1982 , is a distinctly minor reverie . It ' s not to be confused with the author-director-designer ' s so-called " operas " like " The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin , " " Einstein " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // In those larger and lengthier extravaganzas , Mr. Wilson ' s tableaux can transport him and the audience into meditations on the nature of history : A section of " The Civil Wars " staged at Cambridge ' s American Repertory Theater last spring offered churning panoramas of mankind ' s capacity for self-destruction . " The Golden Windows , " by contrast , has little of the intellectual or emotional undertow that can make an artist ' s private visions cohere and resonate in a viewer ' s consciousness . Hours after we ' re out of the theater , we ' re still waiting , esthetically and psychically speaking , for that woman ' s gun to go off. // Even when Mr. Wilson ' s fabulist images do tempt us to drift away with him here , the trance is rudely broken by the jabbering words of his text . " The Golden Windows " often sounds like a parody of " The Cocktail Party . " It is full of non sequiturs ( " I don ' t need a screwdriver " ) , mock-Beckettisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , self-consciously campy romantic bromides ( " You can not live without emotion " ) and , as in " The Civil Wars , " allusions to " King Lear " ( which Mr. Wilson plans to direct in Hamburg in 1987 ) . Another line tells us that " talk is cheap , " and , in this case , is it ever . No matter how often the phrases are repeated , how ironically they are spoken or how inventively they are splintered into an amplified sonic collage , they still constitute a tiresome anthology of metaphysical and absurdist cliches. // In other Wilson texts , including the problematic one provided by the East German playwright Heiner Muller for " The Civil Wars , " the words are spare or are overwhelmed by the pictures and score . The wan recorded music for " The Golden Windows , " a hodgepodge that includes John Gay ' s " Beggar ' s Opera " overture and a whistled " Bicycle Built for Two , " leaves one longing for the absent Philip Glass . The images , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts " shows us the same landscape , with the sentry house changing its position on the horizon as the time advances from early evening to early morning . The small cast of four ( two couples ) further limits the variations in Mr. Wilson ' s compositional geometry. // The BAM production uses two alternating sets of players in three of the roles . Functioning like a constructivist director , Mr. Wilson does not ask his actors for interpretation : They are puppets who execute balletic movements and opaque vocal readings reminiscent of Japanese theater . ( On this occasion , one of the actors is literally a puppet - he descends from the flies hanging from a noose . ) In the company I saw , the only performer working successfully in the Wilson vein was the one who appears with both casts , David Warrilow . The others struggled with their deliberate physical gestures and sometimes acted the script as if it really dramatized the lost loves , lost children and murders that are elliptically mentioned. // The backstage artists ' contributions are far more precise . Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends voices and sounds ricocheting throughout the auditorium , creates the spookiness of old-time radio drama and the magic of ventriloquism . When the lighting designer , Markus Bonzli , is not washing away a midnight-blue sky with a silver dawn , he miraculously isolates a single hand or a glowing glass of milk within the vast space. // What is left unilluminated in " The Golden Windows " is its creator ' s progress as an artist . It ' s unfair that this effort and a few chamber pieces have been the only new works to represent the prolific Mr. Wilson in New York since the 1976 " Einstein . " Those who really wish to ride the next theatrical wave will have to travel well beyond Brooklyn - namely to Austin , where the complete nine-hour " Civil Wars " is scheduled to be performed next year . These days it takes a state as large as Texas to give Mr. Wilson all the room he needs to dream .
