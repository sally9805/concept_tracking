yet never really gone away . It blows in every // few years , stirring up the expectations of program producers and local station managers , // and causing mild rumbles of apprehension at the three major television networks , and then it fades away . But now the idea of creating a fourth network , while hardly yet a reality , is being discussed with a new urgency and seriousness. // A " fourth network " in today ' s terms might not have the same structure as those of ABC , CBS and NBC , each of which offers over 15 hours a day of programs to more than 200 affiliated stations . Instead , individual programs or evenings of programs might be distributed by producers directly to stations in less formal groupings . For viewers , the end result could mean more feature movies of recent vintage , as well as a greater variety of specials and series than are currently found on commercial television. // The chief players fanning the development of such alternative networks - the term favored by their proponents - are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Washington , Chicago , Los Angeles , Dallas , Houston and Boston , which together reach 25 percent of the country , and Paramount Pictures Corp. , which is trying to form its own alliance with stations covering at least 70 percent of the nation ' s television audience. // This time around , alternative networks have moved beyond talk into specific projects that together pose the prospect of stiff competition to ABC , CBS and NBC . Over the next year , independent stations will join with network affiliates to carry programs such as " Thicke of the Night , " a comedy show produced by MGM/ UA in conjunction with Metromedia Inc. , and designed to challenge NBC ' s " Tonight Show " with Johnny Carson , movies not before seen on commercial television and fresh seasons of " Fame " and " Too Close for Comfort " - both popular series canceled by the networks this year. // A number of developments have created the climate for realistic fourth-network thinking , with recent advances in technology being the most significant : Programs can now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper method than using telephone lines . " Satellite delivery has changed all the rules . It opens up distribution to virtually everybody , " says Arnie Semsky , executive vice president of media and network programming at the BBDO advertising agency . According to Mr. Semsky , half of all television stations currently have satellite receiving dishes , a number that could jump to 90 percent within three years. // Even the three established networks concede the threat posed by satellite distribution . " The development of satellite technology has now dissipated any advantage that the free broadcast networks may once have had over other broadcasters , " said one NBC report filed with the Federal Communications Commission this year . " The reason is clear : The cost of distributing a half-hour program to 75 markets via satellite is just $3 , 500 , as opposed to $10 , 000 via ( A.T. &; T. ) land lines. " // The potential new networks also have in their favor a strong base of independent television stations - those not affiliated with the traditional networks - that have become increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Hollywood studios are actively exploring networking in the hopes of increased profits through sales of movies and other programs directly to stations , thus bypassing middlemen at ABC , CBS and NBC . And finally , advertising agencies are seeking new , presumably less expensive outlets for their commercial messages than they can find on the major networks. // Today , there are 192 independent stations versus 109 in 1970 ; in 1980 , these stations had profits of $159. 1 million compared with a loss of $20. 8 million in 1970 . Over the past decade , they have increased their share of the prime-time audience from 10 percent to 18 percent , while the network-affiliated stations have declined from 90 percent in 1978 to 79 percent today. // Independent stations have achieved their success primarily by using reruns of such network hits as " M*A*S*H , " " All in the Family , " " Happy Days " and " Laverne and Shirley . " But they have also increased their viewership by offering imaginative collections of films , including ambitious new movies distributed by such ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holiday Network . But the oldest of these ad hoc networks is Operation Prime Time , a consortium of about 100 independent and network affiliates . Several times a year since 1977 , Operation Prime Time has offered new made-for-television films such as " Blood Feud , " about Jimmy Hoffa and Robert Kennedy , and " A Woman Called Golda , " about Golda Meir. // // Still , the prospects for alternative networks remain cloudy . " There is only limited product out there , " says Ellen Gibbs , an analyst at Goldman Sachs . " The question is , how do you get enough fresh programming to work on a sustainable basis ? " Indeed , whether enough stations can be bound together routinely to support the costs of big-time original programming for an alternative network could prove a basic problem . " The three networks cover 100 percent of the country , and independent stations cover 74 percent of the country . If you just do a network of independents , you don ' t have a full pie , and you can ' t do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masini , president of Telerep Programming Enterprises , which runs Operation Prime Time. // // Still , to further expand their audience and attract more advertising dollars , independent stations are more eager than ever for new , better quality programming . " The last thing we have in mind is to destroy the networks . What I want is for independent operators to have parity , " says Robert Bennett , president of Metromedia Television. // Nevertheless , Mr. Bennett is busily carving out niches in various parts of the day where Metromedia will provide programs to various configurations of independent and network-affiliated stations , using Metromedia ' s own stations as the launching pad. // Of these , " Thicke of the Night " is the most formidable . A daily 90- minute late-night comedy show starring Alan Thicke , a popular Canadian talk-show host , it will begin on 119 stations a week from tomorrow night . Metromedia is financing and distributing the program in a partnership with MGM/UA and Fred Silverman , the former president of NBC . The program , which costs nearly $300 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations . The three partners share half the advertising income from the program , and the local stations take the other half. // If " Thicke " catches on , it could spell trouble for several important network series . Thirty-eight ABC stations have agreed to carry the show , as well as 12 NBC and five CBS stations . A few NBC stations will run Mr. Thicke ' s show instead of Mr. Carson ' s - notably WMAR-TV in Baltimore . Other NBC stations are dropping " The David Letterman Show . " Most of the ABC stations will offer the show after " Nightline , " the nightly news and analysis program with Ted Koppel . However , says Mr. Bennett , " If ' Nightline ' should drop off in the ratings and ' Thicke ' looks terrific , the ABC stations might use ' Thicke ' at 11 : 30 instead of ' Nightline. ' " // During prime time , the hours from 8 to 11 P.M. , Metromedia is financing 22 fresh episodes of " Too Close for Comfort , " a comedy series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network schedule . Metromedia is putting up most of the $8. 4 million in production costs for " Too Close for Comfort , " according to Mr. Bennett . The show has been bought by 31 stations so far , and it will be launched next April when the three networks ' schedules begin filling up with reruns. // Metromedia is also a key player in a network for 24 new episodes of " Fame , " the series about students at New York ' s School of Performing Arts that NBC canceled in May . Although Metromdedia has made no financial investment in " Fame , " the company agreed last spring to carry the show on all its stations in the fall. // The new " Fame " poses a direct prime-time threat to the networks - especially NBC . Of the 106 stations that will carry " Fame , " 29 are from NBC , 15 from ABC , and seven from CBS . A number of NBC affiliates will carry " Fame " on Sunday nights instead of " First Camera , " the fledgling magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience from CBS ' s " 60 Minutes . " Metromedia has other plans for prime time as well . These include a two-hour variety series that could be offered on Saturday nights beginning next April , at a cost to Metromedia of $1 million a show . There is also a proposal for a once-monthly movie night relying primarily on such films as " The Terry Fox Story " and " Right of Way " starring Bette Davis and James Stewart , which have been produced for Home Box Office . Although these films will have been available to 11. 5 million HBO subscribers , Metromedia will have the first crack at them on conventional television. // In addition to the HBO films , Metromedia plans to offer several films designed specifically for its movie night . These include a biography of Lech Walesa , the Polish labor activist , for which Metromedia will pay more than $1 million . " We hope to have 10 to 12 features that would play on this network , perhaps as early as next January , " says Mr. Bennett. // However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent stations has been stalled until a nationally known anchor can be found . " Once we find that person , within 90 days we will launch prime-time news , " said Mr. Bennett. // Hollywood studios are also exploring schemes for launching their own services designed for station consortiums . The studios are eager to find a new commercial broadcasting outlet because the networks have cut back on their purchase of feature films in recent years . With so many feature films appearing first on Home Box Office , their ratings were dropping on the networks , which decided instead to invest in more made-for-television films. // For example , this fall , Embassy Telecommunications , the film and television production company owned in part by Norman Lear , will offer " Embassy Night at the Movies , " a quarterly series of Embassy films not previously seen on commercial television . Nearly 100 stations will show these films , beginning with " Escape From New York " in December , and including " The Howling " and " The Black Marble. " // An even more ambitous alternative is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 , a weekly movie night consisting of features from Paramount and other studios , as well as other first-run specials . For the core of this network , Paramount is now negotiating with a group of independent stations owned by Gaylord Broadcasting Co. , the Tribune Co . , Chris-Craft Industries and Taft Broadcasting , which reach more than one-third of the nation ' s television audience . Paramount is pursuing additional independent stations and network affiliates as well. // // Within the industry , there is considerable debate about the effects these elaborate plans will have on the established networks . " I don ' t think it is going to do anything meaningful to the networks , but it will be just one more thing that chips away at the three-network share of the audience , " says one Wall Street analyst . But others maintain that if affiliates scuttle blocks of network fare to pick up programs from alternative suppliers , the strength of the entrenched networks could be seriously undermined . And network officials say that stations recognize these dangers. // " The affiliates more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this marketplace , there is a need to stand together , " says James Rosenfield , executive vice president of the CBS broadcast group. // Nevertheless , the temptations for stations to break rank are increasing . But as always , the crucial link is the appeal of the programs . " Sure , the technology exists . But look at the networks . We have difficulty on occasion filling prime time with programming that attracts a large audience , " says Robert Mulholland , president of NBC . " It is easier said than done.
