A Conversation With . . . airs on Lifetime , the Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services ' s recently reorganized combination of Daytime and Cable Health Network . The show can usually be seen on Thursdays at 8 : 30 p. m . , Saturdays at 7 : 30 p. m. , and Mondays at 4 p. m. // With Ms. Magazine ' s Gloria Steinem as host , it is not a militant feminist show , although most of her guests tend to be egalitarian. // Rather , the interviews by Ms. Steinem concentrate on character . Often , what emerges is an honest , in-depth portrait as well as a revealing look at the straightforward character of Ms. Steinem herself. // The series started this year with a rather mild interview with Walter Cronkite in which Ms. Steinem focused on the personal side of Uncle Walter . This past week Ms. Steinem conducted an extraordinary interview with an extraordinary person - Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker . ' ' You never know about establishment prizes , ' ' she said about her American Book Award . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the people are who give them . I would have felt happier if I had gotten such a prize from the women of my mother ' s church , because I know these women and I know they have high standards. ' ' // Next week , viewers can catch Ms. Steinem ' s incisive interview with the first female astronaut , Sally Ride . And following that , there are interviews with Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young , Betty Ford , Edward Asner , John Kenneth Galbraith , Abigail Van Buren ( Dear Abby ) , Bianca Jagger , and ' ' Megatrends ' ' author John Naisbitt. // Quite a varied cast of characters . But Ms. Steinem manages to hone in on the essence of all of her guests. // Lifetime cable is a free , advertising-supported 24-hour-a-day service , concentrating on cooking , health , exercise , and life styles . It ' s available on more than 1 , 600 cable systems. // // A chat with Gloria Steinem // The offices of Ms. Magazine seem to reflect a rebellion against old-fashioned housekeeping. // Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York ' s Garment District more than a year ago , there is still an air of surface disorganization about the place : piles of magazines on the floor , crates of papers against the walls , and desks lined with papers as if the occupants had been arguing editorial matters far into the previous night. // It is 8 : 30 a. m. , and Gloria Steinem , one of the founding editors of Ms. , has asked for an early interview : She is catching a morning plane to the Midwest for a speaking engagement. // Despite trendy changes in style , Ms. Steinem ' s long hair and aviator glasses have remained constant throughout her career . Constant also has been her no-nonsense intelligence , her sense of humor , and her obvious compassion for people within and without the contemporary feminist movement , in which she has been a prime mover since its earliest days. // Ms. Steinem stresses the fact that in her Lifetime cable interview show ' ' . . . it ' s important that I make myself as vulnerable as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , whether it identifies it or not , feels uncomfortable . There ' s a balance of power that ' s not right. ' ' // But she says that ' ' you don ' t always quite know when you invite somebody to be interviewed how willing they are going to be to ( speak critically of ) the role that they play in their work. // ' ' For instance , Sally Ride , the astronaut , is in a tough position . She is a very . . . straightforward woman who is also supposed to be a spokesperson for NASA , and she is under the thumb of this administration . . . . I do think , though , that her essential honesty and down-to-earthness come through regardless of what she says . And that is the virtue of television that no print media could ever replicate - you get a feeling of character. ' ' // Walter Cronkite was a surprise to Steinem : ' ' I like him very much . I think of him as a pundit . But the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ' s the way he thinks of himself - as an employee . I assumed that he could do whatever he wants to do , ( but ) . . . he ' s waiting for CBS to tell him what to do . . . . ' ' // Who were her most interesting guests ? // ' ' In terms of intellectual content in a classic sense , Galbraith always delivers . In terms of an interview in which you also have to tell the truth because the guest is the world ' s best spotter of hypocrisy , Pulitzer Prize-winner Alice Walker . Asking a question of Alice is like dropping a pebble down a well . You hear it hit . You know that she takes everything into the center of herself. ' ' // Although her cable TV show doesn ' t seem to promote any special message , does Gloria Steinem herself have any message she would like to get across to women today ? // ' ' The most important message I have may seem like a conventional one , but it ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out in 1984 . I know it ' s harder for women to get to the polls . We have kids , so it ' s harder to leave home . But if every woman reader makes sure that she is registered to vote and gets 10 other women not only registered but out there , it will make a difference . If 60 percent of women vote it will make the difference. ' ' // There is a general perception these days that the women ' s movement is growing more conservative with a return to family values . Is this true , in Ms. Steinem ' s eyes ? // ' ' It is not a return to the family so much as it is an attempt to redefine the family , ' ' she says - ' ' to make a democratic family , to change the power relationships in the family. // ' ' If I say to an audience of women , ' Women are going back to the family , ' they get quite depressed , ' ' she claims . ' ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , ' then . . . ( they ' re encouraged ) . The important thing we must do is define what we mean by family . The right-wing sexist groups are very determined to take over the definition of family - they want it to be a male head-of-household and the woman not working. ' ' // Ms. Steinem says one of her top priorities in the year ahead is the battle for comparable pay. // ' ' While equal pay for equal jobs is still a big issue , it ' s not the whole issue . Why is a registered nurse being paid less than the garbage man ? Why isn ' t her work comparable with the pharmacist ? Comparable pay is as important as equal pay. ' ' // Has Gloria Steinem ' s role as a feminist been responsible for her missing important things in life , such as marriage and family ? // ' ' No , it works the other way around . Feminism makes marriage possible . As long as marriage is a totally unequal partnership , it ' s quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason why I didn ' t get married , was not feminism . It was the 1950s . Because the ' 50s in which I grew up told me that if I got married I had to take a man ' s name , a man ' s identity . I would have no life of my own after that . I had to follow him wherever he went in his job . It drew an oppressive , terrible , humorless , inhuman picture of marriage. // ' ' So feminism makes real love between men and women possible for the first time. ' ' // //
