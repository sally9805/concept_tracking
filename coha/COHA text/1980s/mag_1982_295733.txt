ZIMBABWE Getting Even Ian Smith runs into trouble <P> During Rhodesia 's long , bloody civil war , Prime Minister Ian Smith was a staunch defender of a white Rhodesia and imposed draconian measures against black opponents . Now that Rhodesia has become Zimbabwe and blacks govern in the capital of Harare , once Salisbury , Smith , 63 , has had reason to ponder some of his past actions : the same emergency powers that he invoked to defend white minority rule are being used against him . <P> Last week police searched Smith 's Harare home looking for " subversive " material . They also ordered him to turn over all the firearms he kept on his 6,000-acre farm 150 miles southwest of the capital . The farm had been the scene of a four-hour search three days earlier . <P> Smith 's problems with the police were only the latest incidents in what he describes as a government campaign of " character assassination and blatant intimidation . " When he and supporters from his Republican Front Party gathered for an art exhibition in Harare last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after 90 minutes of questioning to determine whether he had violated laws on illegal political gatherings . Smith was also ordered to hand over his passport after he returned from a business trip to the U.S. and Britain . <P> Smith 's troubles apparently stem from comments he made about the government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe during his trip abroad . In an interview with the Washington Times , Smith had charged that since Mugabe , 58 , took over almost three years ago , the economy of Zimbabwe has been crumbling . What attracted the most attention back home was Smith 's remarks about foreign investment . In the interview , Smith did urge the West to give economic aid to Zimbabwe , but also warned that " there is the danger of the free world falling into the trap of aiding and abetting the establishment of a one-party Marxist dictatorship in a country that should be part of the free world . " <P> Mugabe , who considers himself a Marxist , has made no secret of his long-term aim of turning Zimbabwe into a one-party state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily the U.S. and Britain , to risk a further swing to the left . Given the shrill tone of Smith 's comments , many in Harare wondered if the former Prime Minister was not trying to impose conditions on American aid . <P> The state-controlled television called on the government to detain Smith if it could prove that he had actually urged some Western countries to stop supporting Zimbabwe . The English-language Herald posed the question , " Is this not treason ? " Even some of Smith 's backers among Zimbabwe 's more than 200,000 whites disassociated themselves from his comments . <P> Smith defended his remarks and claimed that his relations with the government have been strained ever since he told Mugabe in a private meeting 18 months ago that he would openly oppose one-party rule in Zimbabwe . " I 'm not looking for trouble , " he told TIME Johannesburg Bureau Chief Marsh Clark last week . " Surely the greater the violation of human rights , the greater is the need for me to speak out .
