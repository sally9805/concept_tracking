The talk at Symphony Hall and elsewhere yesterday revolved around what kind of a name the 19th Pops conductor , 47-year-old John Williams , would make for himself and how his appointment would affect the venerable institution . Yesterday ' s announcement of a successor to the late Arthur Fiedler also saw Harry Ellis Dickson , longtime assistant conductor of the Pops , elevated to associate conductor . " I feel sort of like the best man at a wedding , " Dickson said at an afternoon Symphony Hall press conference . If this had happened 20 years ago , he might have felt badly not succeeding Fiedler , Dickson said . His telegram to Williams in London began : " Congratulation s to you - and to us . " To the general public , Williams is best known as the composer of such Oscar-winning film scores as " Star Wars " and in fact he was in London scoring the sequel to that movie ( called " The Empire Strikes Back " ) . Boston Symphony concertmaster Joseph Silverstein , however , is also familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There ' s an excellent violin concerto , " Silverstein said yesterday , referring to the work that Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony will play next season . And going back 14 years , " an excellent string piece " that Silverstein said he has great interest in doing though he did not say whether as violinist or conductor . Maestro Fiedler ' s widow Ellen could not be reached for comment but sources quoted her as being " positive " about the choice of Williams . The Fiedlers ' oldest child , Johanna Fiedler , who works in the Metropolitan Opera press office , said : " It seems to me that John Williams is a wonderful choice . I think it is so important that someone can bridge the pop and classical music worlds . That , after all , was papa ' s theory . Papa never really spoke very much about his successor at the Pops , but he did feel that the next conductor was going to have to make changes and strike out in some fresh directions . This , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish him the best of success . " Other reactions within the music community : Philip K. Allen , a vice president of the Boston Symphony : " The thing that thrills me is that he ' s going to appeal to a whole new generation of listeners . He ' s attuned to the modern music lovers . They will go to Pops and be led into classical music . " Ben Zander , conductor of the Boston Philharmonic : " It is a very large pair of shoes to fill , and in all probability no one person can be expected to fill all aspects of the job as we came to know it . Williams is clearly a very impressive musician , at least in the realm of popular and film music . It remains to be seen if he can command as much respect as a performer of classical music and as a beloved figure of and for the community , which was such a special part of Fiedler ' s contribution . " Sue Barton Kirkland , national publicity director for Columbia Pictures who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " : " I ' m thrilled about it . He ' s an extraordinarily talented man and you ' re lucky to have him in your community . He has a lovely sense of humor and loves a challenge . " Movie producer David Brown who hired Williams to compose the scores for " The Sugarland Express " and both " Jaws " movies : " Before we assign a writer or look at actors or directors we find out if we can get John Williams . He ' s a serious musician , a brilliant composer - you have to sign him a year in advance . His appointment to the Pops lends great prestige to the entire movie industry . " Andy McKaie , national publicity director of Arista Records : " Williams brings a tremendous reputation as composer and musician to his new post . His soundtrack of Close Encounters ' for Arista sold close to a million units . He also did the soundtrack to The Fury ' which was also very successful and this prolific man also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December . I think it is a fine choice . " Bob Merlis , natonal publicity director for Warner Bros . Records : " His most recently recorded release for Warners was the Superman ' soundtrack . I think it ' s a pretty exciting appointment and what is particularly interesting is that you ' ve got a behind-the-scenes person finally emerging into public view . Williams is a knowledgeable and talented man . It ' s also interesting that a composer will be a conductor of the Pops and it ' s conceivable that Williams could conduct an evening of Williams . " Sal Ingeme , regional director of promotion for Columbia Records : " Williams ' appointment comes as a complete joy . I have admired him as composer and conductor for years . He brings dignity , total professionalism and a name that is known and respected all over the world . He brings to the Boston Pops what the Boston Pops , in turn , brings to him .
