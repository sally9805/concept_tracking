Wearing a stylish pinstripe , double-breasted suit , Roald Sagdeyev , the director of the Soviet Space Research Institute , began by disarming the group of Cornell astronomers during a recent U.S. tour with a folksy story about a Russian woodsman . Then , in a voice strained from singing When the Saints Go Marching In to Soviets and Americans gathered at the Chautauqua Institution , he discussed the dangers of nuclear weapons and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) , or Star Wars . Finally , the trim , 5-ft. 8-in. physicist , who rarely drinks and never smokes , concluded with his vision for a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. mission to Mars . The performance was vintage Sagdeyev : a mixture of wit , charm and trenchant observation . <P> Besides being an accomplished scientist and administrator , Sagdeyev is the Soviet Union 's chief space diplomat . He spent more than two weeks in August flying from the U.S.S.R. to Hawaii , New York and Washington to recruit scientists for Soviet missions and to publicize Moscow 's space program . His dizzying schedule of speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon his dacha outside Moscow and even his burning passion , chess . In recognition of his achievements at the Soviet Space Institute ( IKI ) , he was chosen to head the Soviets ' new Supercomputing Institute and was appointed as Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's special adviser on the U.S. Star Wars program . <P> Born in Moscow , Sagdeyev , 54 , once planned to become a mathematician , like both of his parents . But as a student at Moscow University in the mid-1950s , he switched majors to study physics . " A physicist can still enjoy the beauty of mathematics and have a more intimate interaction with nature , " he says . Sagdeyev also took up English , which he calls the " first necessity for a scientist . " He passed along his appreciation of the language to his son and daughter , both computer scientists , and to his two small grandchildren . <P> While working on nuclear-fission control at the Soviet Institute of Atomic Energy in 1958 , the young scientist was stunned by his first meeting , in Geneva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates the experience with wonder : " For the first time I met foreign scientists , Americans , doing the same job and reporting their results . It was like meeting extraterrestrials  --  extraterrestrials working with the same laws of physics . It was exemplary proof that science has no borders . " <P> Sagdeyev increasingly found traditional Soviet science , influenced heavily by Communist Party politics , stifling . In 1961 he helped found Akademgorodok ( Science City ) , an informal think tank located in the Siberian countryside , away from the intensely political atmosphere of Moscow . Sagdeyev was at first concerned about neglecting his research when he was asked to assume control of the struggling space-science program at IKI in 1973 . The position offered a measure of independence ( though hardly on a level enjoyed by top NASA scientists ) , but it was still part of the rigid Soviet scientific bureaucracy . Recalls Sagdeyev : " It meant a big change in my life-style . There was a desire to do my own research and yet the obligation to run a large institution with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment .
