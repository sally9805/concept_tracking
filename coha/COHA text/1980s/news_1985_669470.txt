More than 3 , 000 people involved in organized crime were convicted in the 1980-84 period , more than 2 , 000 of them last year , according to United States Department of Justice sources . Mob leaders in Chicago , Cleveland , Los Angeles , Kansas City , Philadelphia , New Orleans , and New York have been convicted . Indictments have been obtained against others in Boston , Denver , Tampa , and Milwaukee , while two major cases are pending in New York. // // Chief target of the nationwide effort is the Mafia - also known as La Cosa Nostra ( literally , ' ' our thing ' ' ) - a group whose very existence within the US has long been denied by many , including some law-enforcement officials . Now Justice Department officials say they can prove there are at least 24 Mafia ' ' families ' ' in the US , overseen by a secret control group , or ' ' commission , ' ' dominated by leaders of the five Mafia families in New York City . An objective in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York is to establish the existence and role of the Mafia commission. // In a trial that began last June , Gennaro Angiulo , alleged Mafia boss of Boston , four of his brothers , and two others are charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to murder . A number of alleged second-echelon mob figures were charged in a second indictment. // Three factors make the current drive against organized crime more effective than past efforts : // // * The Justice Department ' s Organized Crime Strike Force has reduced interagency rivalry and produced effective coordination among federal , state , and local law-enforcement organizations. // // * A strategy of going after entire criminal organizations , rather than individual mobsters , has resulted in group indictments . When these proceedings end in convictions ( as they often have ) , they remove entire echelons of leadership - undermining discipline and throwing syndicate activities into disarray. // // * Laws passed 10 or more years ago have enabled prosecutors to gather evidence that was previously unobtainable . These laws include a 1961 act of Congress that made interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 act allowing law-enforcement agencies to seek court orders for wiretaps and electronic ' ' bugs. ' ' // Another important piece of anticrime legislation was the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act . This act authorized the federal witness security program to protect witnesses from mob revenge , provided for the current 14 regional strike forces , and defined what are called Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) . // Under the act , federal investigators working on RICO cases are allowed to become more involved in local cases , are permitted to seek a single prosecution for a series of crimes , and can hold a mob boss responsible for acts he did not personally commit . Prosecutors of RICO cases may seek mandatory 20-year sentences and can request ' ' forfeiture ' ' ( confiscation ) of the assets of those convicted under the act. // In the Boston case , for example , 000 seized in a 1981 raid , and a 68-foot yacht. // Although the witness protection program has been a key factor in obtaining information from disaffected mob members , increased use of sophisticated eavesdropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence against organized-crime figures . The Angiulo case is largely based on more than 800 hours of conversations overheard and taped through two hidden microphones . Fifty hours of taped conversations are being used as evidence in the trial. // Edward F. Harrington , who was US attorney in Boston when the current drive against organized crime began , says it developed in three phases : organizing the overall strategy in the ' 60s , setting up the machinery in the ' 70s , and gathering the intelligence that could lead to indictments and convictions in the ' 80s. // Some say the roots of the current effort are even deeper than that . They refer to the examination of organized crime by the late US Sen. Estes Kefauver . In his 1952 report , Senator Kefauver asserted that the Mafia was ' ' no fairy tale , ' ' but ' ' a shadowy international organization that lurks behind much of America ' s organized criminal activities. ' ' // His assertion was given added credibility on Nov. 14 , 1957 , when state police in Apalachin , N.Y. surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . Evidence against many of those who attended the Apalachin meeting was produced by the late US Sen. John McClellan , then chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field. // In the Kennedy and Johnson administrations , Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and his successor , Nicholas Katzenbach , pushed for the legislation on which the current antimob effort is based. // G. Robert Blakey , O ' Neill Professor of Law at Notre Dame University , who was chief counsel for the McClellan committee , says the number of cases brought against organized-crime figures in the last three or four years ' ' is like day to night , ' ' compared with prior years . But , he adds , ' ' While I am very encouraged by the cases being brought , the design put in place by Congress is not being fully implemented. ' ' // He particularly recommends wider use of the Organized Crime Act ' s provisions for forfeiture of assets and the seeking of mandatory 20-year sentences for ' ' dangerous offenders. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what ' s happening , and if it continues for a decade , that facet of organized crime ( the Cosa Nostra ) could be eliminated . ' ' There are organized criminal activities run by others , he explains , such as the drug traffic from Latin America. // Twenty-five years after the effort to expose and prosecute the Mafia in the US began , the ' ' tide is now running against the mob , " says Mr. Harrington. // //
