How to spoof the Enquirer ? <P> <P> Perhaps nothing is harder to satirize than a venture that is already a caricature of itself . By that standard , the ultimate challenge to a parodist would have to be the weekly scandal sheets sold at supermarket checkout counters , epitomized by the 56-year-old National Enquirer ( circ. 5 million ) . The Enquirer and its imitators , including the Globe , Star and National Examiner , feverishly mine such exotic " news " as people biting snakes , unimaginably obese couples losing hundreds of pounds , clergymen having visions of aliens or ghosts , and almost any gossip involving the Kennedy family . <P> Hard as it may be to concoct articles more bizarre than what the tabloids already run , the challenge has been taken up by Tony Hendra , 41 , the editor-entrepreneur behind the 1978 parody Not the New York Times and last April 's Off the Wall Street Journal . Says Hendra : " The Enquirer style is difficult . You have to keep sentences to ten words and use ' mind-boggling ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layout right you have to unlearn everything you know about good design . " <P> About 1.6 million copies of his Irrational Inquirer are scheduled to reach newsstands this week , and except for the price , $2 , vs. 65 for the Enquirer , the takeoff is all but indistinguishable from the original . Indeed , that may be the jape 's major flaw . Even regular readers of the Enquirer and its ilk may err in guessing which of the following stories comes from the spoof and which from the " real " tabloids : - The Chinese Communist government is sabotaging the U.S.-by spreading herpes. - John Lennon speaks daily from beyond the grave to his widow Yoko Ono . <P> &gt; Making funny faces can help you look years younger . <P> &gt; You can live in an enclosed steel box and be comfortable . <P> &gt; " Good Night , Gracie Allen : My horror encounter with actress 's ghost . " * <P> The close imitation was taken , possibly sincerely , as flattery in the Lantana , Fla. , headquarters of the Enquirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , I noticed the similarity . It 's another confirmation that we are No. 1 . " Hendra 's partner and publisher , Larry Durocher , 42 , joked in an interview that the major difference between the publications is that the spoof is stapled together , while the Enquirer is merely folded . Then he noted another distinction that probably ought to matter to the 11 million credulous readers of the major U.S. scandal tabloids . Said Durocher : " We make no claim that our stories are true . " <P> <P> *Only the last story is from the Irrational Inquirer.
