To watchers along the dike , the last voyage of the schooner Alvin Clark , made on Sept. 3 , may have appeared as perilous as the one the ancient ship made in 1864 , when it capsized and sank , drowning three of its five-man crew . Residents of two adjoining cities , Menominee , Mich. , and Marinette , Wis. , have followed the ups and downs of the ancient freighter since 1969 , the year it was raised from deep water in Green Bay , an arm of Lake Michigan . Scuba divers had toiled for two seasons to refloat the vessel . Acclaim greeted their feat when they brought the 218-ton ship up from 110 feet down , using simple and improvised equipment , often borrowed . Interest was nationwide . Several plans to restore the craft were proposed . The Alvin Clark needed restoration . A century of repose on the lumpy lake bottom had distorted its hull . Other deterioration was evident , although the ship ' s oak construction had defied time ' s ravages surprisingly well . Practically all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they had spilled when the ship capsized . But restoration requires funds . Despite the cheering and urgings of savants that this relic constitutes an authentic peep at 19th Century Great Lakes shipping , few funds materialized . For a time , the Clark was afloat again . Then it was berthed in a dry slip in Menominee . It became a showpiece in an effort to raise money . But admission fees never produced enough funds to finance rehabilitation . Years of neglect followed . Things looked bleak for the Alvin Clark until last June , when a local group of four men headed by Donald Gillette took possession of the ship from its original salvor . Reportedly , they paid $117 , 000 ; the price included almost 3 acres of land on which it rested . A marina is planned there . As a first step in what amounted to a second salvage effort , it was necessary to move the ship to a new berth less than a block away . Conventional house-moving methods could not work here : It was feared the thrust of lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to float it across . First he fastened a layer of heavy plastic sheeting to the bottom , theorizing that this would staunch any inflow of water through leaks brought on by years on dry land . Then he put heavy earthmovers to work constucting a 10-foot-high dike . The earth wall encircled the ship and then formed a canal that led to the Alvin Clark ' s proposed resting spot . Two heavy-duty diesel pumps on wheels were put to work filling the canal with water from the Menominee River . The City of Menominee lent a fire engine to assist . Gillette figured that his improvised leak-proofing and two pumps he had installed on the Clark would keep water from rising dangerously in the ship as the canal filled . Some leakage developed in the canal wall itself but not enough to cause trouble . The Clark stirred in its muddy bed , then floated free . A towline was extended from the ship to the boom of a crane standing on dry land . Then the crane eased the fragile ship to its new location . The canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the old ship came to rest without incurring any new damage , Gillette breathed a sigh of relief . So did sidewalk superintendents . Gillette has determined what the ship ' s immediate needs are : Safeguard the hull from further decay , restep the masts , reinstall the bowsprit and wooden davits at the stern from which a ship ' s boat once hung , enlarge the museum where visitors can view gear and fittings found on the ship as well as a 20-minute film about its raising . Most spectacular and innovative will be the new sails on the Clark ' s 90-foot-plus masts . These are to be cut from white fish-netting to convey the scenic effect of a ship at sail , Gillette explained. - The 20th Century Alvin Clark story began in the summer of 1967 , when a commercial fisherman ' s $1 , 400 trawl net snagged something at a point where charts showed no obstruction . The fisherman appealed to Frank Hoffmann , then owner of a prospering supper club and an expert scuba diver and underwater explorer . Consenting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was wrapped around the mast of a ship whose hull lay far below . Hoffmann and fellow scuba enthusiasts decided to try to salvage the ship . The rest of 1967 was spent exploring details on the ship and finding or improvising salvage equipment . Knowledgeable people were puzzled that neither cargo nor ballast were found in the hold . Such weighting is commonly considered essential in a sailing ship . Some light was shed on this a few years ago in a statement published in the Chicago History magazine . The statement was attributed to a mariner who had learned his trade soon after 1900 : " Ballast was seldom carried on those shallow draft schooners , " Herbert Koepke was quoted as saying , " although sometimes they ' d haul the anchor to the high side to counter the capsizing thrust of the sails . People used to say that one cook would carry the pots from the galley stove up there , and even the ashes . Yes , and they ' d move a case of beer to the high side if there happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cases of beer for such emergencies . " In the spring of 1968 , actual salvaging commenced . The two masts were lifted from the schooner . Then divers attacked a 7-foot-deep bank of silt that had accumulated in its hold . A large capacity suction pump was used for this . Operating the suction hose in water " dusty " with suspended silt was a trying and dangerous chore . Divers feared that the mud might slide over them . Other divers worked with pressure hoses to gouge tunnels under the schooner ' s bottom to thread lifting cables . The actual raising did not come until the summer of 1969 . Work went slowly because divers could remain at that depth only 20 minutes at a time . When hand-operated cranks finally began revolving on a barge anchored over the Alvin Clark , the the lift exerted by the cables lowered the barge slightly . Then the barge shuddered and popped up a few inches . The Clark had broken free from the bottom . After that , the schooner was cranked snuggly up against the barge ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yachts filled with cheering onlookers followed the Alvin Clark as it was towed to Menominee . Safe in the harbor , the old ship was pumped out and brought completely to the surface . A pump aboard the vessel ran continuously to keep it floating . The masts were restepped , and some rerigging and refurbishing was done . Soon the schooner was eased into an earthen slip . It was destined to remain there almost 19 years . Throughout that period Hoffmann sought help to renovate the schooner . He appealed to statesmen , to state and national governments , to historical societies and to privately funded foundations . Howard Chapelle , senior historian at the Smithsonian Institution , wrote immediately after the raising : " This is a true treasure of the Great Lakes . Your recovery of this schooner is of far greater importance than a few hull fragments and coins from some supposed treasure ship . In your find we will be no help was forthcoming . Some help was provided for repair work by local people , however . If assistance was scant , recognition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register of historic sites . Michigan pronounced it a " state historical site . " The U.S. Coast Guard listed it as the oldest existing U.S. merchant ship . The City of Menominee also sued Hoffmann for taxes on it but failed to collect . " If I knew then what I know now , " Hoffmann said , " I would have taken the Clark on a tour while everyone was enthusiastic . Everybody wanted see the ship right away . People were eager to come on board while I was still cleaning her up . We could have made enough money then to take care of our ship properly and provide a suitable memorial for her . " One of Hoffmann ' s efforts to improve things was the attempted salvage of the wreck of a steamer . He meant to place it alongside the sailing ship as a contrast . In 1985 , with his scuba crew about him , he set about raising the hull of the steamship Erie Hackley from a depth of 100 feet . On this job divers had the assistance of barge-mounted cranes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the weight of the steamer ' s boilers , the cargo in the hold and the suction grip of the mud on its bottom . At one point , overwhelmed by despair , Hoffmann set the Clark ablaze . The fire was quickly extinguished , he was arrested , put in jail for a week and on probation for a year . Through the 19 years of stalemate , various ideas for the Clark were proposed . " Float it on a barge to big cities-that ' s where the money is , " one helpful soul urged . Another suggested converting it to a floating dance hall , or to a restaurant or to a gaming spot . One defeatist opted for taking the old schooner out to deep water and scuttling it . More elaborate was the notion voiced by another man of similar mind . He thought the Clark should be burned as a floating funeral pyre , in the old Viking tradition . A Marinette resident likened Hoffmann to the victim of a Greek tragedy in which a worthy man is hounded to his doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marinette , remarked : " Hoffmann ' s troubles go on and on , like the woes of the heroine in a soap opera . He ' s had enough grief to outfit several soap operas , as a matter of fact . " Ebsch covered the story of the Alvin Clark since it was discovered . Another man expressed puzzlement that scuba divers all over the lake are exploring old wrecks and coming up with bits and pieces of their finds . " And all the while , " this man states , " The Alvin Clark is lying there all complete , just waiting for someone to come along and give it a good home . " Eventually Gillette and his group noticed that the shoreline on which the ship stood would make a useful marina . They negotiated a deal . When Hoffmann surrendered the ship and the small house next to it , he was , under the contract , allowed just three days to pull out . He departed at once for an unknown point in Florida , announcing that he meant to smell the roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope for Frank Hoffmann . But I do have hope for the Alvin Clark . " Ebsch , summing up for a large segment of local opinion , said in discussing the problem of saving the Clark : " Seamanship didn ' t do it . Grantsmanship didn ' t do it . So we ' ll all watch and see what showmanship can accomplish . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Charles Osgood .
