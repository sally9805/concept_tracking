The big question raised by the Tower commission can not be found anywhere in its report  --  not in the damning findings , not in the eight appendixes , not in the convoluted diagrams , not in the numbingly detailed chronology of misdeeds and folly . At least not in so many words . But it shadows and haunts almost every line on the 288 blue-bound pages : Can Reagan recover ? <P> Not just from the backlash of a misconceived and bungled policy of trading arms for hostages , though that backlash could damage all U.S. foreign relations . Not just from suspicions of illegality in aiding the Nicaraguan contras , though those suspicions threaten to undermine one of the President 's most cherished goals . Not even just from further revelations of incompetence , cover-up or worse that may come out of probes by congressional committees and Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh building on the Tower findings , painful and protracted as that process will be . <P> Rather , the real question for Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff Howard Baker , the veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is whether they can somehow redraw the sorry picture of the lack of presidential leadership that emerges from the report . It is a portrait all the more devastating for having been sketched with tight- lipped reluctance by three elder statesmen struggling to be both objective and polite . Reagan stands exposed as a President willfully ignorant of what his aides were doing , myopically unaware of the glaring contradictions between his public and secret policies , complacently dependent on advisers who never once , from start to finish , presented him with any systematic analysis of aims , means , risks and alternatives . And , in the end , as a President unable to recall when , how or even whether he had reached the key decision that started the whole arms-to-Iran affair . Reagan 's final word onwhether he had given advance approval for Israeli sales of U.S.-made weapons in 1985 , delivered in a letter to the commission after he had first told it that he had and then that he had not : " I 'm afraid that I let myself be influenced by others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is , ' I do n't remember  --  period . ' "
