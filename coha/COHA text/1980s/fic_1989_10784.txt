had to stop teaching until the rain eased . There were verandason the classroom blocks and in the center a trampled space where we held morning assembly . Outside my office door was a foot of railway track that I banged with an iron rod at five minutes to eight . Morning assembly was a prayer , a song , and a pep-talk . There was as yet no national anthem . We sang Mbuye Dalitsani Africa , " God Watch Over Africa , " a sort of Pan-African hymn with the lugubrious plodding melody of a funeral dirge . Likoni used to read from the Bible  --  usually the Psalms . I avoided the Psalms but I liked Jonah , Ecclesiastes and Ezekiel  --  especially I liked declaiming about the valley of bones . I also read from Aesop 's Fables , and well-known speeches from Shakespeare , and memorablepoems . I made appropriate comments . I read announcementsand I called the roll . On these cold mornings the wind fluttered the blue gums and made the tin roofs moan and snatched at the children 's clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they answered " Heah " or " Sah . " A new road connected the school to the lower road which , once used for logging-it led through a forest  --  ended at the township of Kanjedza . I had built the school road . Building it had made my reputation . In old Likoni 's time it had been a narrow path through chest-high thorn bushes and scrub . I wanted the path widened . " Big cars will pay calls on us , " Deputy Mambo said . But it was n't that  --  I did n't want cars . I merely imagined a long sweeping road that would dignify the school and the hill . For the road I asked the Public Works Department to send us some workmen . " I can send some men , but you will have to pay them , " the works manager told me over the phone . His tiny distorted voice came out of a heavy old-fashioned receiver . " Why ca n't you pay them ? " " PWD is in suspension , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That is the question . " Independence was not until July and at the moment there was no one in the department to okay an order . Men still showed up every morning , but there was nothing for them to ( 1o ; and although they were on the payroll they received no money.  |p201I  had a budget . I had allotted sixty pounds for the road , which seemed plenty  --  over a hundred dollars . " Send me six men . " The men arrived on bicycles . They stared at the students until assembly ended , and then they hacked at some bushes and bullieda big tree . Afterwards they slept under it . They said they wanted more money and when I refused to give it to them they pushed their bicycles down the narrow path and pedaled away . Fifty-four pounds remained . Mr. Nyirongo said that the headmanof a nearby village would supply the men to clear the road , but that he wanted a bribe . " It 's just bushes , " I said . " If the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everyone said that the students had worms , which was why they were so languid . But I had an idea . I went to the bank in Zimba and changed the remaining fifty-four pounds into " tickeys "  --  small gray threepence coins . I returned to the school with canvas money bags hanging on my bike . I had almost four and a half thousand tickeys . At the end of the next day 's assembly I shocked the students by declaring a holiday . But before I dismissed them I said , " Watch me . " I went to the path with my bags of coins and walked the length of it , flinging tickeys left and right , the width of the road I wanted . Like locusts , the students descended hungrily , tearing at the bushes , and by the middle of the afternoon the land was cleared . A little tidying made it into the road I wanted . That was my first significant accomplishment as a young headmaster . I was popular also for my special homework policy . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made a rule that all homework was to be done at school , before the kids set off for home . And they had homework on weekends , but none on Friday afternoons . This meant that we teachers had no weekend papers to mark . The school was called Chamba Secondary , after the hill just behind it . The word signified Indian hemp and it was also a frenzied and futile dance . Everyone who was told what it meant said , " Very appropriate ! " But I regarded that as unkind . Give them a chance , I said ; and I also thought : Give me a chance.  |p202But  the main reason I made sure we had no papers to mark on weekends was that I was busy those days with my own affairs . I wrote the school rules and I fitted them to my life . That odd boy Willy Msemba had been right when he twisted his face at me and said , " African girls ! " It was my secret life  --  my real life . The Peace Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , but in Africa this second one became fuller and freer . I sometimes thought that it was the best reason for having gone there , especially then , just before independence , when no one was in charge . It had started in the most innocent way , my first week in Nyasaland . I was in Zimba , the one-street town . I had pedaled through the rain to mail some letters . ( It thrilled me to write letters from Africa . I was the hero of those letters . But it was so hard to be truthful and not take liberties . ) On Saturdays the post office closed at noon , and so afterwards I killed time in the small market  --  squatting women selling misshapen and dusty vegetables . I ate lunch at the Zimba Coffee Shop . The place was owned by two Greek brothers and was run by a yellow-haired Greek woman . She sold me a cheese sandwich , a curry puff they called a samosa , and a cup of strong coffee . She watched me eat , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were a distant relation . That made me uncomfortable . I walked into the rain . There was not much else in the town  --  five Indian shops , all selling identical merchandise , canned goods and cloth ; a car-repair shop and gas station , a branch of Grindlay 's Bank , a fish and chip shop , a bakery , and The Nyasaland Trading Company . None were run by Africans . Two old women were the sales clerks iii The Nyasaland Trading Company . This was a general store inp203a low wooden building . It stocked colonial merchandise jars of jam , stationery , clothes , last month 's London newspapers , books , ink , shoes , oil lamps , rubber boots . When I walked in , one of the women was wiping a feather duster ( and they sold those too ) against a contraption they called a radiogram  --  a large varnished cabinet with a yellow plastic window . " It 's a wireless , and it also plays gramophone records , " the woman had told me on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Most of the white settlers had left the country for good . The shelves were becoming very dusty . Africans did not buy Birds Custard , Bovril , Swan Vestas , Dundee Thick-Cut Marmalade , Fenwick 's Gumboots , Hacks Honey Lemons , Gentleman 's Relish , Nairn 's Capital Oatcakes , tins of Bath Olivers or Battley 's Pickled Walnuts . I browsed in the Nyasaland Trading Company until the rain stopped , bought a Penguin paperback  --  a novel set in the tropics by a writer I admired , S. Prasad  --  and then I started back to Chamba on my bike , bracing myself for the three-mile journey , which was mostly uphill . Passing another shop , I saw a mass of small bottles and cartonsin the window , and it was my first indication of the Nyasalanders ' liking for patent medicine  --  DeWitt 's Worm Syrup , Philipps ' Gripe Water , Goodmorning Lung Tonic , Iron Tonic , Liver Elixir , Red Syrup ( " For Strength " ) , Kidney and Bladder Pills by Baxter , Fam-Lax , Day-Glo , X-Pell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hookworms , Whip-Worms and l'hreadworms " ) . There were skin lighteners  --  TV Beautybox Day and Night Skin Lightening Pack , Dear Heart Skin Brightenerand Glo-Tone . And hair straighteners  --  Hairstrate , and Glyco Superstrate . This shop had customers inside , but reading these labels I thought : Where am I ? Farther up the road , at the edge of town , there were African men lingering outside a shopfront . There was music at the door , a harmonious howling . Later I realized that this was my first taste of the Beatles : in a back street , in Zimba , a small town in Nyasaland , in Central Africa . It was not a shop . I went nearer . It was noisy , there were African girls at the windows , and young men in sunglasses watched inc from the veranda . A sign above them was clumsily lettered BEAUTIFUL BAMBOO BAR.  |p204Did  someone wave to me ? I thought I saw an African girl beckon , but she had vanished when I looked again . Anyway , I went in . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinct and had the effect of making the place seem darker and more shadowy . It was one room and it smelled dankly of piss and dirt , like a crawlspace . It was damp , smoke blew through one window , the mirror was streaked with green and red paint , and on the walls were shelves of beer  --  small plump bottles of Lion and Castle Lager . The bartender wore a T-shirt and a tweed vest and ragged shorts and plastic sandals . He approached me nervously . I said , " Moni . Muli bwanji , achimwene ? " Hello brother : it was the friendliest greeting . He was too astonished to reply at once . Then he said , " You are speaking . " " Yes , brother . " " Oh , thank you , father , " he said . " What is your name , brother ? " " My name is Wilson . " They all had names like that  --  Wilson , Millson , Edison , Redison ; and Henderson and Johnston . " Thank you , Wilson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Please stop calling me father . " " What is your name , sir ? " " Please , brother . " " Yes , achimwene "  --  and he almost choked on the word  --  " what is your name ? " " My name is Andy . " " Oh , thank you , Mr. Undie , " he said . He told me that I was the first mzungu ever to go into the Beautiful Bamboo Bar . That cheered me up . Was n't that the point of my being in Africa ? Nearby , there were five or six girls sitting at wooden tables . The first thing I noticed about them was that they had no hair  --  or very little , no more than fuzz . But their shaven heads seemed to emphasize the shapeliness of their bodies . They wore dresses , but even among the shadows in the bar I could tell they were naked underneath . They were barefoot , but that scented strangely appropriate to their having no hair on their heads.  |p205I  sat at a table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to them in their own language . They asked me where I had learned it . " Would you believe Syracuse University ? " And I added , " UpstateNew York . United States . " They laughed , because everywhere outside Nyasaland sounded magical . And yet I knew that Nyasaland was the only place that I wanted to be . " American , " one girl said , trying the word out . It seemed that they were working casually in the Bamboo . They had come from distant villages . They believed Zimba was the big city ; they had attached themselves to this bar . They lived out back . The jukebox was playing Shimmy Shimmy Koko Bop , and an African girl was doing a flat-footed African dance . Her name was Rosie . She said her favorite singer was Chubby Checker . She also liked Elvis , Del Shannon and The Orlons . " Who are the Orlons ? " " Wah-Watusi , " Rosie said . " Oh , them . " " And Spokes Mashiani , " she said . " South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of singers , namesof songs , and how much can you drink , and have you ever seena lion ? And Shimmy shimmy koko bop . Finally , Rosie said , " You 're the teacher up at Chamba ? " I said yes , and turned to the door . It had gone dark outside . " The big house with the flowers in front , " she said . Shimmy shimmy bop . " It used to belong to Mr. Campbell . He went back to En-gland . " " They all went back to England , " Rosie said . The other girl said wistfully , " They just left us . " She sounded like an abandoned child . I said , " But I 'm not leaving . " " That 's good , " Rosie said . I said , " Come and visit me someday . " " Yes , " she said , and put her hand over her face and giggled behind it . I took a breath and said , " What about now , sister ? " She made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stronger than yes.  |p206We  left , walking side by side . I pushed my bike because I could not carry her on my crossbar uphill . She said that no one minded her leaving : the Bamboo was not very busy . " No money for European beer just for African beer . " She meant the porridgey stuff the market women sold in old oil cans . In the pitch-black forest I took her hand . It was hard and heavy , tough fingers and a palm the texture of an old boot . But I hung on to it . At home I sat her down and poured her a glass of gin . She sipped it , making faces . She was barefoot , and I could see that her feet were rough and cracked like her hands . Her green dress was both fancy and ragged , and the strip of lace at her collar was torn . I made a fire in the fireplace , burning eucalyptus logs , and we sat in front of it on the sofa Mr. Campbell had left . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Books , " she said . She looked at the pictures  --  of Scotland , from calendars . Of cats , of dogs . I asked if she liked them . She said no . She kept prowling . " Table . " She smoothed it with her hand . " Flowers . Looking glass . Curtains . Carpet . Knife and fork . Tomato sauce . Mus-tard . " Next to the cluster of sticky bottles on the table  --  they too were Campbell 's  --  we had dinner , served by Captain . Captain was my cook : he also had been left by Campbell . He was too nervous to disguise his leering , and he spoke to Rosie in a language I did not know , perhaps Yao or Tonga . I caught the word " American . " She ate hungrily and with a lot of noise , wetting her fingers on the food and then wiping her lips with the back of her hand . I learned then that the frantic manners of the poor are their way of not wasting a crumb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her at the table I was aroused and wanted to make love to her . After the kitchen was silent  --  Captain gone  --  I took her leatheryhand and , saying nothing , led her into the bedroom . She stepped out of her dress and folded it neatly on a chair . Then she sat on the bed and tipped onto her back and lifted her legs . I knelt before her and started , and a moment later she shrieked ,  | " Mwamuna wanga ! " ( " My man ! " ) . As soon as I had finished she wanted me again . We made love three times in the same sort of sandwichlike way . It had been over a month of abstinence for me . She fell asleep and snored all night . In the morning I took her back to town  --  downhill , on the crossbar of my bike . " Do you want money ? " She just laughed . " I want a beer , " she said . It was nine o'clock in the morning , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Rosie from the sleepyeyedbartender and a glass of sugary tea for myself . We sat in the empty bar , saying nothing , listening to the bell at the Catholicmission being rung . It sounded stern , like a school bell . That was Sunday . I spent the rest of the day writing letters , and Rosie appeared in some of these letters . Letters were all I had . I lived for them  --  writing them , receiving them . Nyasaland was a country with no writing . And I was always touched by the wornout way the envelopes looked  --  so battered and resolute , having reached me from so far . I kept writing until the sun set behind Chamba Hill . I was happy . I often found memory sexier than actual experience , and anticipating a woman was always an erotic pleasure . All day I had been preparing myself for my return to the Beautiful Bamboo . I went after dinner , my bicycle lamp shaking in the dark on the bad road . " Rosie is not here , " another girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Grace . Between us we drank eleven bottles of beer and when my eyes refused to focus I knew I had had enough . I stood up clumsily and headed for the door . On the veranda I paused and felt a hand close over my fingers . I thought it was Rosie , because it was cracked and large and had weight but no grip , like a kind of dog 's paw . It was Grace . " I come with you . " I could n't speak . I was moving forward . I tripped on the edge of the open sewer and staggered . " Sorry ! " she cried . I turned back and tried to set my eyes on her . She was a blur . And yet I did not feel drunk . I was small and sober inside a big drunken both ' .  | " I love you , mister , " she said . She insisted on pushing my bike . I was grateful to her for that . I walked behind her , catching my toes on the ruts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not talk . We went to bed like an old married couple and were immediately asleep . But in a dark morning hour I woke up and felt her damp skin against mine , and I snuggled against her . She helped me and then almost killed my desire as she chafed me with her rough hands . She muttered and sighed in pleasure , a kind of laughter , and then she went snufflingly to sleep . Her smell kept me awake for a while . She had the same odor as my students  --  soap , dirt , skin , sweat . It was a human smell  --  a rank sort of dead-and-alive odor . It was dusty and undefinable , like mushrooms . She was gone in the morning . She had vanished , leaving a dent and a smell on the sheet that was about the size of her body . Captain said , " She told me sorry '  --  she is seeing her sister today , " and he put a plate of eggs in front of me . He was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's African Rifles . He could make scones , he could make mint sauce and gravy , he baked bread . He spoke little English but he knew words like " roast " and " joint " and " pudding . " He spoke army Swahili , though we stuck to Chinyanja . He was a Yao from Fort Johnson , and a muslim . Now that he had seen me with African girls he seemed to regard me in a different light . He became friendlier , slightly more talkative and familiar , but at the same time protective . " Next time I can take the girl back to town on your bicycle  --  if you say yes . He used the slang word for bicycle : njinga , which was the sound of a bicycle bell . " Yes , " I said . " Next time . " He knew something that I had only just realized , that there would be many more times . I was happy , but that Monday morning , walking down the road I had built , towards the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flecks clinging to my pubic hair . I pinched one out and took it to the science block to examine it under a microscope . I saw that a crab louse is aptly named . There were other customers in Mulji 's Cash Chemist in Maravi that afternoon , so I whispered lice.  | " Crab lice or body lice ? " Mulji said out loud , and everyone heard : Grab lice or bhodee lice ? The powder he sold me killed them all . I combed out the dead nits , spent a busy week at the school , and on Friday I was back at the Beautiful Bamboo . That had been my first week in the country , and that was how it was every subsequent week . Friday , Saturday , and Sunday nights I picked up African girls at the Bamboo and took them back to Chamba . I returned them to town in the morning , or else Captain did , carrying them on the crossbar of my bike . There were about twenty different girls at the Bamboo . They were not jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply wanted the experience of sleeping with an American . And I wanted them . We danced in a jumping , shaking way , to the Beatles and Elvis and Major Lance and Little Millie and " The Wah-Watusi . " A song I hated was " How Do You Do It " sung by Jerry and the Pacemakers , but they played it all the time . I developed a taste for the woozy penny-whistle music they said was South African . Being dancing partners was part of their function at the Bamboo . And yet they were neither customers nor workers . They hinted that they were runaways . They hung around . There was always food for them , and always beer . I never saw money change hands . On Fridays I was impatient . I had a few beers and went home early , with an African girl . They were interested in my house , but not particularly impressed . I liked the place . I lived alone . I had three bedrooms and a fireplace and all of Campbell 's old Spectators . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the great slab of rock rising out of the dark-green tea estates . I had a flower garden , and Campbell 's herbaceous borders , and my own pigeon loft . Some days , Captain put a cloth over his head and slaughtered a pair of pigeons , cutting their throats according to muslim custom , and made them into pigeoncurry . Captain also did the shopping , leaving me free on Saturdays . That was the day I stayed late at the Bamboo . I did not leave until well after midnight . I never left alone . Often I reached ( home as dawn was breaking . I would be pushing my hike uphill.  |p210That  was lovely . The sky would lift and lighten , and night seemed to dissolve and grow rosier as I reached the top of the road and left the forest . The birds would be screeching and the cocks crowing . There was always mist in the air and the grass was soaked . I walked to the center of my sloping lawn as the sun appeared at the edge of the far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike under the pigeon loft , and the jingling woke and fluttered the birds . And then on the lawn I unzipped and pissed into the sunrise , a whole night 's beer , rocking back on my heels and feeling wonderful the morning chill , the pink dawn , the dampness , and the tootling birds . The African girl walked in front of me and laughed at what I was doing . She left footprints in the dewy grass  --  dark feet showingin silver . She stood there  --  the bursting sunrise behind her thin skirt dazzling between her legs . That was how it was for five months ; and then Likoni left and I took his place , and for the next two months it was even better . As headmaster , I made the rules . And that was the situation  --  frenetic , happy , I lost count of the nights and girls  --  when Willy Msemba was brought into my office and given bricks to make . It had all been a secret activity . It was what Africans themselvesdid on weekends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what ? To me it seemed almost virtuous  --  making love to African girls . What was the point in being in Africa if I did n't do that ? Promiscuous was not the word for it . My activity was different , it was explosive . During the week it was nothing , and then it was a frenzy  --  three girls a weekend . Itp211overstimulated me , and those days I could not sleep ; but by Monday I was calm again . I was young , I felt it was temporary , I had just had my twentythirdbirthday . That day I copied Milton 's poem about turning twenty-three into my notebook . It contained a line that gave me a pang : Time , the subtle thief of youth . . . I was changing fast . I mistook maturing for aging and was desperate to use all the time I had . I could not have done more . It made me extremely tired . Once I went to sleep while teaching a class . It was night school . I taught it Tuesday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of anyone going to sleep while talking . I had been telling my English class the story of Animal Farm . They were too dim to read it themselves . " The pigs began to quarrel , " I said . The Tilly lamp fizzed on my desk . " They accused each other of trying to waw . . . aw ... " And then I went to sleep . My hand still supported my head and the warm buzz of the lamp kept me under . When I woke up , no one spoke ; no one giggled . They were mostly older people , very polite , and they liked me . Falling asleep while teaching made me seem eccentric and harmless . And of course half of them slept through the lesson , too . I became popular . Tell us about cowboys , they said . Tell us about guns . Do you have a horse ? Have you flown in a plane ? Did you ever meet Elvis ? Are you rich ? Are you a Christian ? What languagedo Negroes talk ? Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was round , but all believed in witches . They felt they had been swindled by the British . I had arrived in the country at the perfect time : they were ready to be Americans . I could only encourage them . The African girls at the Beautiful Bamboo had the same attitudeas my students . They were not merely susceptible to Americans , they were infatuated . Having overcome their fear of whites , they realized that we found them desirable , and they liked themselves better . Some of them had stopped wearing torn dresses , and now wore printed T-shirts and blue jeans . One shaven-headed barefoot girl wore a floppy sweatshirt printed with the head of Beet hoven . Some were very young  --  fourteen or fifteen ; and none was older than twenty . They were sturdy , hard-fleshed and slim  --  inp212Nyasaland no African was fat . At least I had not seen one . Their hands were so calloused they could hold hot pots without noticing ; they walked miles barefoot ; and they could pop bottle caps off with their teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarriageable . They had disgraced themselves in various ways , and had been kicked out of their villages . A few were rebels and had run away , but most had had children or abortions or been involved in intrigues . A few had committed petty crimes . At least one was a witch  --  or so the others said . None could expect to marry an African man . They had no status , they had no dowry . It took months for me to discover these things , but when I did I understood why they were amazed that we chased them and took them home and made love to them . We desired them ! They had been rejected by their families and their villages , and we romanced them . I was single-minded , but it was not much trouble . I had everything I wanted : unlimited and guiltless sex . And because this was Africa and they were black it was not only a pleasure , it was also an act of political commitment . I pondered the fact that I was in Nyasaland , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nowhere else I wished to be . Sometimes I thought : I 'll never leave . All that sex could have driven me mad , but I think it made me judicious . It concentrated my mind during the week and it kept me from pawing the students . I felt it was my duty to discourage such practices , though Deputy Mambo and Mr. Nyirongo did it all the time  --  fucking the little girl students in the grim , scolding way that they had learned from the missionaries . I was occasionally tempted . After night school one evening a big goon named Eddyson  --  a part-time janitor  --  knocked at the window of my house . Usually he found me wild pigeons for my loft , but tonight he brought me a slender girl . She was smiling nervously and wringing her hands . " Thanks , brother , " I said . The three of us stood on the shadowy veranda . " Take her , Mr. Anderea . " Her name was Emmy . She had big dark eyes and a thin pretty face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wrap herself around me and laugh with her tongue out . I knew suchp213girls , younger than she  --  I took her to be fifteen . It was not her age . She was a student . I could n't . I sent them away . I did n't want Eddyson pimping for me and I knew there had to be a clear line between my two lives . They crashed away , trampled the herbaceous border and cut through the hibiscus hedge , Eddyson explaining that I was probablytoo tired and Emmy meekly agreeing . Later he told me he had her himself on the way home , tipped her onto her back , just like that , under a tree . " And I got mud on my knees ! " It was not hard to lead two lives and to keep them separate when they were both so satisfying . One was sex , the other work . There were no more mentions at school of the Msemba incident , but the silence was so deliberate it was like an accusation . They had had a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reminded of it every time they saw his twenty stacked bricks . And were probably reminded of my failure , too . We would never get the new chimbuzi at this rate . I endured a week of silence , feeling defensive but fairly happy ; and then had a visit from the Peace Corps . My conscience was usually clear but authority made me feel guilty . I was in my office adding up the attendance register and heard a vehicle on my road  --  the tickey road . That was a rare enough sight , but it was more unusual even than that  --  the Peace Corps jeep , with Ed Wently at the wheel . I heard chairs being scraped and teachers calling their classes to order . Kids were springing from their desks and standing up to see who the visitors were . It was their road , too . Someone else was with Wently on the front seat . I guessed it was an agency man or a poverty tourist  --  why else would anyone come here ?  --  but when the jeep drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my age , with the look of a volunteer . It was the ready-for-anything look : willing but a little wary . " Got a new recruit for you , Parent . " His name was Rockwell , he was nervous , and I knew at once it would be a mistake to call him Rocky . He was round-shoulderedand a little pale and sly-looking . He did not smile . But like a lot of humorless and unsmiling people he had a startling laugh . It was sudden and terrible , not really a laugh at all . " We do n't actually need a new teacher , Ed. "  | " You can find room for him . What do you say ? " That was the Peace Corps attitude  --  make room , double up , hustle , look good , compromise , and keep smiling : very oldfashioned . Be full of pep ! The Peace Corps showed up without notice and you were supposed to jump ; and then you would n't see them for months . They were in Washington , being congratulatedon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blantyre . Ed Wently disliked me . He was a jock , a member of the BlantyreClub rugby team . The club did not have any African members . " They do n't play rugby , " Wently had said . I wanted to make an issue of it and force him to resign from the club , but I could not get any volunteers to agree with me . My feeling was partly political and partly a desire to be a nuisance . And then I stopped caring . I lived my own life . I believed that I was on my own , in my wrinkled suit and squashed hat ; in my house , with my cook , and my pigeon loft , the only mzungu for miles around . That was why I was so dismayed when Wently told me to make room for Rockwell . " We do n't have a spare house . " " You 've got three bedrooms , Andy ! " I thought : Shit . And there was something in Rockwell 's expression that told me he was none too keen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had only laughed and that had alarmed me . " You 've got a Peace Corps house , " Wently said . " You have to be flexible . " That was always the possibility in bush posts  --  that once you got used to them the circumstances changed , and you had to adjust again . And because we never had advance warning , every visit was a surprise . I liked the country , I enjoyed being headmaster , I loved the African girls . But the thought of being in the Peace Corps discouragedme . I hated this jock , Wently , bringing up the Peace Corps  --  they offered no support , they only imposed on me , and they took all the credit . " What can you teach ? " Rockwell said , " I was doing a little chemistry and math at my lash place . "  | " Where was that ? " " Sierra Leone . I asked for a transfer . " Probably bush fever : a crazy  --  a freak . I said , " We 're trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And you can help Mr. Nyirongo with Form Three math . " " What 's a chimbuzi ? " " You 'll have to start learning the language , " I said . " It 's a shithouse . " Rockwell then pronounced a strange sentence . " I 've always been very excited about sanitary facilities . " We stared at him . " That 's what I could n't stand about Sierra Leone . " I could not think of anything to say . " The restrooms , " he said . " The restrooms ? " Even Wently was baffled . Rockwell said , " Yeah . People went to the bathroom in the street . " I reminded myself to write that down . " No one does that in Nyasaland , " Wendy said , and put his arm around Rockwell 's shoulder , the way jocks hug each other . " You 're going to love it here , Ward . " So his name was Ward Rockwell . But from that moment I thought of him as Weird Rockwell . " Bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went down the road . It was a bad start . And things did not improve . He did notspeak the language . That was crucial . Without noticing it I hadbeen using it constantly . I gave him my grammar book andtaught him the greetings , but he showed no aptitude . I asked him whether he spoke any foreign languages . " A little Tex-Mex , " he said . " Is that like pig Latin ? " " Are you serious ? " he said . He pronounced it sirius , like the constellation . That was the California in him . He had been raised in Houston but after UCLA he had stayed in Los Angeles . He said contimpree peeners when I mentioned ( to irritate him ) that I liked the look of rotting flesh in the work of Ivan Albright . His birth sign was Jiminie . It was had enough that he spoke no Chinyanja . It did not help that his English was peculiar . Innerleen-ninl , he said and hoorible.  | " Hey , that cook . When I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It took me awhile to work that one out . " The cook 's name is Captain . He does n't speak English . " " Everyone spoke English in Sierra Leone , even the servants . " I thought of three rejoinders to this . But we were in the bush . An ill-judged remark could cause weeks of miffed silence . Idecided not to risk it just then . " But my cook in Kenema was minilly deficient , " he said , and made his first and only joke in the year I knew him . " Kenema was an enema . He had the California way of saying hamburgers , heavy on the ham and swallowing the burgers . He was pudgy and lumpish and he had the heavy person 's curse : terrible feet . They were visibly twisted and made him totter . " I 've got wicked arches , " he explained . " I have to wear cookies in my shoes . " He made the word sound like shees . The word hygiene made him show his teeth , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talk about cleanliness was just a way of talking about filth ; and his bowels were his favorite subject . He was preoccupied rather than obsessed , and not disgusting enough to be truly interesting . But his cast of mind made him an untiring latrine-builder . Only a few days after he arrived there was progress . He staked out the footings and started digging the runoffs , and near the clay pit was a rising stack of new bricks . I showed him my design for the chimbuzi but he said it was not ambitious enough . He took me around the site and showed me how he was going to enlarge it . I helped him measure the new dimensions . He talked about his bowels as he worked on the latrine , like a gourmet cook rejoicing in his hearty appetite . Captain did not like him . He asked me if the new bwana was a Yehudi . I hated having to answer but the answer was no in anv case . Rockwell could only speak to Captain through me . " Tell him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner my room , " " Tell him  --  " " Look , " I said . " Captain works for me . Do n't keep giving him orders . If you do n't like it here , find another place . " " It 's okay here , " Rockwell said . " But I sometimes wonder if that guy washes . "  | " He 's a muslim . He washes more often than you do . " " Yeah , " he said doubtfully . " Five times a day . " This impressed Rockwell . " Bodily hygiene is real important . " He washed his own floor , he scrubbed his own clothes , he disinfected the bathroom every day , he hung a container of chemicals in the cistern that turned the toilet water blue . Sometimeshe did not talk to me for several days , and then he would talk nonstop , often incomprehensibly , about a mail-order businesshe wanted to start in California . And he talked about our chimbuzi . He took that very seriously . He dug test holes , drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the basics and the insides that really count . It 's like your body . You 've got to be clean inside , get all the poisons out  --  " A parcel was delivered in a Land-Rover from the Nyasaland Trading Company . It weighed ten pounds and even wellwrappedits odor made my eyes sting . Rockwell was delighted when I gave it to him . " It 's urinal candy , " he said . " For our new sanitary facility . " He was very methodical , which made him heavy going in conversation , because he talked the way he worked . His political conservatism seemed like another aspect of his toilet-talk , and he had stories to support his theories . One revolting one was about some Africans in Sierra Leone who refused to flush toilet paper down the hopper . " See ? You ca n't teach these people anything . " " Not true . The Peace Corps brought oral sex to Nyasaland . " " That turns my stomach , " he said , and looked genuinely wretched . " Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset him . The only way I could live in the same house was to disagree with everything he said . It was a way of doing battle . I discovered that doing that , disagreeing on principle , meant I was wrong a great deal of the time and often made a fool of myself . Rockwell did not usually answer back . If I hurt his feelings he sulked . He would n't fight . He said , " Words ! Words ! " and ran to his room . But after his silences he opened up : bodily hygiene , what happens to food in your intestines , the new sanitary facilitN.  --  andsometimes it was Africa and the Peace Corps . " When I go hack I 'm going to write a book . I 'm going to call it The Big Lie . "  | " I thought you were going to start a mail-order business . " " The mail-order business will give me the free time to write , " he said . " By the way , I notice you write . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was my other secret ; but so dark was the riddle of writing that even though I did it every day I was afraid to think about my ambition , and never said a word to anyone else about it . Rockwell had heard me typing , that was all . It was a source of pride to me that no one in the world had ever seen me write a word of fiction . " Letters home , " I said . " Anyway , what kind of mail-order business ? " " You promise you wo n't steal my ideas ? " " I promise . That 's a performatory utterance , you know . " " Words . " He was grinning . " Words are neat . " This was late one night in front of the fire . The fire always gave him frightening features , and his eagerness tonight combined with the jumping flames on his face made him seem much crazier than usual . " Do you know how on labels it says , Keep in a cool dry place ' ? All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you name it , thousands of them . But what is a cool dry place ? Most people do n't really have one . So that 's going to be one of my main items . " This was insane , and his friendliness only made it worse . What was he talking about ? I decided not to alarm him by asking , but simply said it was a tremendous idea . " Think so ? I do too ! I figure it 'll be a kind of really neat box . Sort of lid , lined inside , little chambers "  --  he was shaping and hacking with his hands  --  " and on the outside it 'll say The Cool Dry Place . " " Sounds terrific , " I said , and wondered whether he would guess what I really thought if I excused myself and went to bed . I said mail order had great possibilities . " But Ward Rockwell 's going to have thousands of stock items . Ever notice how bottles of polish and stuff like that has directionssaying , Wipe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one when you need it ? " " You 're going to sell them . " " Right . In a little see-through pouch . I 'm going to call it Thep219Clean Soft Cloth . " He looked very pleased with himself . He said , " In the same line I 'm going to have that other essential product . Guess what ? " " Ca n't guess , " I said . I could have but I knew it would be a mistake . " The Damp Rag . Ever see the label that advises you to apply whatever it is with a damp rag ? I 'm going to sell them . In hermeticallysealed envelopes , pre-dampened rags . See , the thing about rags "  --  his voice was cracking  --  " rags are filthy . But my ragsI wanted him to stop . He went on . He told me of his elaborate system of shelves for directions that said " Keep out of the reach of children " and his specially engineered coin for " Pry up with a coin . " At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas were a result of fatigue and isolation . He was tiring himself in the building of the chimbuzi . I decided to break a vow I had made and introduce him to the Beautiful Bamboo . He was a slow steady drinker , and beer made him even more monotonous . When he was drunk he was solemn . He sat in the noise and music , ignoringthe girls . He drank and sweated and sulked . And then he went home , putting one foot ahead of the other . " Guess what I hate about that place . " " Tell me . " " You ca n't talk there , " he said . It was very dark on the road . " The thing is , Andy , I feel I can really talk to you . " That alarmed me . I said , " You know , those girls are friendly . All you have to do is say the word and they 'd go home with you . He made an exasperated noise and then said , " The word is germs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , because I wanted to keep my secret safe from Rockwell . But his attitude affected me . It was more than disapproval  --  it was horror . I could not perform . It was his fault . Gladys just laughed and squeezed the useless thing . It seemed to me the worst fate on earth to be impotent . The next night was a Monday . Rockwell had worked all day on the latrine  --  I could tell by his glazed eyes . I hoped that he would go to his room and calnn himself by polishing something ,  |p220but  instead he joined me in front of the fire . I had wanted to sit there and brood about my impotence . " Words , " he said . " Words like bored housewife . ' That turns me on . He had been thinking . " Words are real funny . Words can be neat . Semi-naked bored housewife . ' " What was he doing in Central Africa ? He should never have gone so far from home . This country was having a bad effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a very ordinaryperson , but being here was turning him into someone else . Yet I did not pity him . I resented him . I thought : What if I stay impotent ? He took the poker and hit the fire and grinned . " People say I 've got to drive out to the airport ' or He misses his kids ' or It needs a new cartridge . ' It 's all words . People never said those things before . Someday we wo n't say It has to heat up before it 'll work . ' It 'll just start . I mean , heat up ' is very physical . " He was talking to the fire in a slow droning way . " We 'll be moving into advanced electronics . Heat up ' is like sex . We 'll stop having machines like that . They 'll be cool and clean instead . And very small . " Saying that , he made his eyes small . Then I tried not to look at him . I wanted him to talk about hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Bottle 's really strange . The more you say it . I thought : Bottle is not strange . You are . " He 's not ready for that kind of commitment . ' A few years ago you 'd never hear anyone say that . " Out of the corner of my eye I could see that he was smiling at the fire . " Or My eyes are my best feature . ' People never used to say that . They do now . " I said , " I do n't think men say it . " " I mean women , " he said . " See , I figured it out . I was putting in some pipe today and thinking  --  there 's man words and there 's woman words . " " What are woman words ? " I 'm going to cry my eyes out . ' "  |p221He  said it quickly and looked very pleased with himself . And then he spoke again . " I have n't got a thing to wear . ' " He was droning but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him so absorbed , even on the subject of his bowels . I wanted to stop him . I wanted to say : Ward , Africa is outside the window . Look at it . " Hey , " and he poked the fire a little too roughly , " a few years ago you 'd never have heard anyone say , Her semi-nude body was found in a shallow grave . ' " That smile . And he did not need me to encourage him . " You would n't have read , Clad in only her torn underwear she was floating facedown in a ditch . ' " No , " I said . " There was evidence of sexual assault , " he said . " Her bruised and partly clothed body was found by a jogger . " He was still smiling . That same week I moved into a tiny two-room house in Kanjedza . They called it a township . It was one step up from a slum , literally so , because it was on a hillside , and lower down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Chiggamoola . Kanjedza was a settlement of about a hundred concrete sheds  --  tin roofs , no running water , outside chimbuzis , no trees . Paths eroded by rain to gullies . Smoky fires . Mad scabby dogs . I always carried a stick because of the dogs . In the African locations the dogs barked only at whites . I had a neighbor , Harry Gombo . I complained that the houses were damp . " At least they are not mud houses , " Harry said . He was embarrassed by crumbly mud . walls and thatchedp222roofs . " He is mudding his house , " he said of a poor man he disliked . He often used the word " primitive . " He never saw that the virtue of a mud house was that it was disposable . It was abandoned after two or three years . Yet these cement huts in Kanjedza would go on rotting and stinking forever . But I was happy there . I saw my move as brave and stylish . I was the only mzungu in the area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this white kid in the middle of an African township . The other thing was that these townships were regarded as very dangerous  --  but I knew better . My rent was five pounds a month . Captain had one room , I had the other . He said he had lived in worse places , but I gave him more money nonetheless : Hardship Allowance . I had simply moved out and left Ward Rockwell my house at Chamba Hill . I wanted to live in an African way . The roads through the township were so steep and rutted I could not ride my bike . When it rained the roads were sluices . Some of the huts had been undermined by rushing rainwater and were tipped and slumped into deep ditches . Others were cracked from having subsided . Weeds grew in the tin roofs . There were chimneys but there was smoke everywhere  --  and furious dogs and skinny chickens . It was a peculiar mess of a place . Harry Gombo said Africans were not used to this sort of hut . They cooked inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They pissed against their walls . They did not plant anything  --  the ground was pitched too sharply and was too stony . They had chopped down all the trees and used them for firewood . Their goats had eaten the rest of the greenery  --  the bushes , the grass . The chickenspecked at rubble , the dogs fought over old corncobs . There was always a rubber tire smoking beside the road . It never caught fire , it never went out , it always stank . To keep warm in this cold season the Africans built fires in buckets . Sometimes they asphyxiated themselves . None of the huts were painted . Each one was ugly and uncomfortable arid had a nasty smell . Just behind , where there should have been a garden or a bougainvillaea , was a latrine in a shed  --  the chin , . Captain hated it here , I knew , but he did not complain . It was most of all a blow to his pride . It was also harder for him to cook properly in such poor conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadmaking , no slowly roasted joints . He was used to the electric stove at Chamba ; the oven ; the refrigerator . Here we had a screened-in box  --  " the meat-safe . " I urged him to cook African food , which was easy enough . He finally relented and then every meal was the same  --  a lump of steamed dough served with a dish of thick stew . You broke off a piece of dough , rolled it into a dumpling , made a deep thumbprint in it and pushed it through the stew . When it was very wet you ate it . I drank tea , I drank beer , and like the Africans I varied my diet with cookies and hard candy : biscuits and boiled sweets , the British legacy . Captain brought home finger bananas and sour oranges from the market . I killed the taste with black cigarettes which cost a penny each  --  a tickey for a box of three . This was my home  --  at last , an African hut . The girls I brought to it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Chamba Hill . One of the girls was a neighbor . Her name was Abby . She worked at the Rainbow Cinema , taking tickets . She was nineteen , she had two children , she was long-legged and pretty  --  and strangest of all , she was a runner on the Zimba town track team . She said she was a very fast runner . " I do not know why ! " It was a mystery to her why she was able to run the two-twenty in less than 33.2 seconds . She was not interested in distance running ; she was a sprinter . She was that way in bed , too : very frantic and then it was all over . More than anything Abby wanted to run in Rhodesia . Rhodesia seemed distant and glamorous . She was sure she could win the women 's two-twenty in Nyasaland and be sent to Salisburyto compete . Nyasaland had these prodigies  --  the natural athlete ( a mother of two ) ; the math genius ( barefoot village boy ) ; the long-distance traveler ( the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education " ) . One of my students , a tiny Tonga with a swollen face , was brilliant on the penny-whistle ; and another , a ball boy at the Blantyre Sports Club , was an inspired tennis player . But these exceptional people were seldom taken seriously , and indeed most of them saw themselves as clowns . They would do little more with their gifts than be messengers or hawkers , and they would all die young . Harry Gumbo was a book salesman . he wore a cowboy hat ,  |p224which  contrasted oddly with his buck teeth and his pin-striped suit . He liked the singer Jim Reeves . He wondered whether I had met the man . Harry sang " This World Is Not My Home ( I'mJust A-Passing Through ) . " He wrote long abusive letters to his districtmanager in Salisbury . " I have sent another fizzing rocket to the bwana . " He wanted a company car . He said he was glad to have an American for a neighbor . He admired me for romancing Abby , the track star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said I could be their daddy . He sang the Jim Reeves song , " That Dear Old Daddy of Mine . " Abby brought her two children over to my house when she worked late at the Rainbow . That did not help . It changed my mood when I came with her and had to step over their little sleeping forms  --  so still on the floor , like mealy-sacks  --  in order to get into bed with Abby . She roused them and sent them to sleep in the narrow hallway between the two rooms . They picked up their ragged blankets and tottered sleepily away , and they were soon asleep again . But that took away all my ardor . One night I took Rosie home , and the next morning I saw that she had a bulging belly . " Are you pregnant , sister ? " She said yes with that click of her teeth . " Whose is it ? " She said , " Yours ! " and laughed in a taunting way . She kept it up and my blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do calculations . It was hopeless , because I could not remember when I had made love to her  --  all the times . But I said it was impossible and I tried to seem very certain . " Get on me , " she said . She rolled onto her back and lifted her legs . Foreplay was unknown in that country . I could not perform . The mention of her baby , the size of her belly , and the sun streaming through the window all killed my desire . I had been genuinely afraid by the easy mocking way she had said , " Yours ! " I suggested that instead of making love we have a cup of tea . She said okay and hopped out of bed . Captain made us breakfast and while he was out of the room I asked her how many months ? ' ' Three or four , " she said.  |p225I  screamed , " I have n't touched you for six months ! " " Do n't make noise , " she said and squinted at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I was just joking . " " Black humor . " She said she had no idea who the father was , but when the baby was born she would go to the Chiperoni Blanket Factory and compare the child 's features with the men in the rag room , and then she would know . Captain took her into town on the bike and that night I brought home a different girl . I always saw Abby on Sundays , because there was only one evening show . These days she never stayed late . Her coach had told her to drink a lot of milk and to sleep well . She was training for the race that would get her to Rhodesia . I asked her why  --  though she was in training  --  she let me make love to her . " Because I am so close to you , " she said . This seemed very tender . " My house is just this side . It 's easy . " The township was a mess  --  it smelled , it was muddy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you were n't careful you would fall into a ditch . All these were characteristics of the country . But there was no crime . The Africans in Kanjedza were too poor to get very drunk , and they worked too hard to stay up at night raising hell . There was cooperation  --  people helped each other , minded each other 's children , cooked for each other , did their washing together at the standpipe : clothes in the morning , dishes at night . They were village courtesies , and though it seemed an unlikely place to find them practiced , the Africans saw nothing unusual in it . The township was not a mess to them . They said they were proud of their cement huts and tin roofs . But they were city Africans and rather lonely . In spite of the bleakness and the outward dirtiness of the huts , the broken and smeared windows , the ragged curtains and splintereddoors and the way they put boulders on the roof to hold the tin down  --  in spite of this , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , in starched blouses and pleated skirts . All day they lurked looking frumpish in sarong 's and old coals and rubber sandals ; but when they wentp226into town they were dressed up and unrecognizable . They wore pretty dresses and the men wore neckties and jackets . Harry Gombo wore a three-piece suit and carried a carved walking stick . He usually wore a felt hat , too . " Do you like my sombrero ? " he said . We were on our way to the Kanjedza shop everyone called the canteen . " We call that a porkpie hat , " I said . " You 're a snappy dresser , Harry . " He told me that he had grown up in the low-lying town of Port Herald and had never worn more than a pair of shorts until he was eighteen . " And then I went about in a little singlet . " " What 's a singlet ? " I said , taking out my small notebook . " A vest . " He meant an undershirt . He said , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things I did n't have . " He said he was surprised , but he believed me . And when I did n't say anything more , he asked , " What things ? " I thought awhile . I wanted to be truthful . He said , " A gun ? " " No , I had a gun . " " What , then ? " " Sex , mainly . " He said , " I poked my first girl when I was eight or nine . " He was smoothing his silk tie as we approached the canteen . Then he sat on the bench in front , but very carefully , to keep the creases in his trousers . " When did you start ? " " Too late  --  later than I wanted , " I said . " When you have to wait a long time for things you never get enough . " " Sex is like eating . " " America 's a very hungry country , Harry . " " I had a white woman once . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was transferred . Her husband was in the Forestry Commission . " He smiled gently and said , " Doris . " " What are we doing here ? " He stood up and tapped his walking stick on the veranda of the canteen . " Cuff links , " he said.  |p227African  girls were what I needed . Just after I left Harry I saw Abby hurrying to her house . I said , " Want to visit me , sister ? " If they said yes it meant everything . I sometimes said , " Want to go upstairs ? " This was regarded as a great joke , because the houses all had one story . But that upstairs business was also unambiguous . Abby said , " Okay . " As soon as we finished making love she said she had to go quickly  --  she was late for running practice . " Why did you come with me then ? " " Because you wanted me . " I walked with her to the track and on my way home a barefoot girl beckoned me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " Do it to me here , " and leaned backwards against the fence , bowlegged . " I ca n't . " She laughed because I was ridiculous . Did n't I see it was the only way ? She said she lived in a small hut in Chiggamoola with her mother . She demanded that I begin . She said , " Put it in . " " My feet hurt . I 've got wicked arches . I have to wear cookies in my shoes . " She was still laughing . " That 's why I ca n't do it standing up . " One Friday , feeling eager , I asked a girl named Gloria to come home with me . She said she could n't leave without her friend , a skinny girl no more than fourteen . The girl was in conversation with a sinister-looking man in sunglasses  --  one of the black minerswho worked in South Africa and who often showed up at the Bamboo . " I have bought this girl a bottle of beer , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't let her go just like that . " He meant that for this two-shilling bottle of Castle Lager the skinny girl was his . I said , " You should be ashamed of yourself , brother . " The young girl wore greasy makeup  --  skin lightener , mascara , and lipstick . Her face was a popeyed mask . But she had no shape . Her yellow dress hung straight down like a school uniform . She bent over like a boy to buckle her plastic sandal and I saw she was wearing school bloomers.  | " What 's your name , sister ? " She said something that sounded like " Boopy . " " You 'd better come with us , " I said , and put my arm around Gloria . I could feel her dark sinuous body beneath the loose dress . She was still damp from dancing and touching her excited me  --  it was like holding a snake against me . Back at Kanjedza I locked Captain into his room , gave Boopy some blankets , and showed her where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room to Gloria and later woke her again . She said she was too tired . She said that she wanted to sleep  --  a sort of apologetic complaint . " Take my friend . " " No ! " I said . I was shocked , and I waited for her to react . But all I heard were snores from Gloria , and her snoring made me wakeful . I lay wide-eyed in the darkness of my room , breathing in little sips . The young girl Boopy snuffled and swallowed when I woke her , and then she giggled a little and held me . Caressing her , I was running my fingers over all her bones . She was very thin but she had large bush-baby eyes . She was a child in my arms , but as soon as I took her on the floor she snorted and sighed , and she moved like a woman who knew what she wanted . None of my students lived here in the township  --  they were too poor even for this place . A few lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so I had more freedom than I had ever had at my house up at Chamba . I sometimes visited Rockwell at the house . It was not friendship , though I felt friendlier now that I saw less of him . It was curiosity , and a suspicion in my mind that one day he might hang himself . I liked to think that I might interrupt him and prevent it . He had refused to hire a cook . He said , " They do n't wash their hands . They do n't boil the water . It 's dirty . " " That 's Nyasaland . That 's the world . That 's the norm , Ward . " " America 's clean . " " America 's unusual . " He lived on peanut butter sandwiches . " Hey , it 's good . They grow peanuts here . " His lips were always bluish . " Kool-Aid , " he explained.  |p229The  Africans told me that Rockwell was wopusa , which meant crazy and cruel , as well as stupid ; and he was cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend his garden . I said that Americans did not have servants , but I knew that Africans resentedwhites who lived alone and separate , and who did n't offer them work . I did n't like ratting on Rockwell , but I could see that living by himself , so far from Africans , he was becoming even stranger . What did he know about Africans ? I asked him this question . He said , " I 'll tell you . You very seldom see a bald one . " He had a way of nodding that was almost as alarming as the things he said . " I 've been thinking about bald people a lot recently . Ever notice how bald men often have cuts and scabs and wounds on their heads ? You always see a Band-Aid up there . Now why is that ? " I said , " I 'm not sure , Ward . " " I am just so grateful to you for handing over your chimbuzi to me . Chimbuzi , huh ? Learning the language , huh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I get scared , " he said . " When I finish it I 'll have nothing else to do . " That fear made him go slowly . The chimbuzi was much bigger than I had envisaged  --  great beehive stacks of bricks were accumulatingand from what he had so far built I could see that he had made an elaborate design . " Look familiar ? " he asked me one day . I said , " In a way . " " I based it on The Alamo . See the way the wings shoot out ? " What kept me from reporting him to Ed Wently was the fact that he got on so well with Miss Natwick . When he had reached the end of his tether , she would tell me . They sat together in the staff room every recess , drinking tea and eating dry cookies . After Deputy Mambo and Mr. Nyirongo left the room , Miss Natwick said , " You ca n't teach these people anything . " " That 's just what I was going to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their idols well away , " Miss Natwick said , seeming to quote a hymn . After a moment , her face hardened and she added , " And if they have n't , bugger them . "  |p230Miss  Natwick would then offer Rockwell a Kitkat or a chocolatefinger from her handbag and they would be there until Deputy Mambo returned for another cup of tea . Sometimes the school seemed hopeless  --  not simply the shambles Miss Natwick said it was , but chaos . It was always on the verge of flying apart . But it held . I thought : This is Africa . This is the world . It is not chaos but only disorder . Dirt is the norm . Bad water is the norm . Filthy toilets are typical . Stinks are natural , and all dogs are wild . If you walk barefoot hookwormsbore into the balls of your feet . Stretch out your arm and mosquitoes inject sleeping sickness into it . Sit still for a moment and fleas leap onto your body . Embrace your lover and you get lice . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to Abby 's race at the track in Zimba . She had trained and slept well and drunk milk . But it did her no good . She came fifth in the two-twenty . She said she was through with running  --  it was too much for a woman with kids . She was better off , she said , collecting tickets at the Rainbow Cinema and fooling with me . That was another day , and that night another night . The best way to teach English , I felt , was to get in there and start them talking . I asked questions , I had them chant the answers , I made them compete , and when I ran out of prize candy I gave them cough drops from Mulji 's , which they liked just as much . Miss Natwick complained that the students said " What ? " insteadof " Pardon ? " and she objected to their saying " You 're welcome . " People complained that things happened too slowly in Africa , but my experience so far was that everything moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , and the change inspired hope and confidence . In a matter of ' months the students hadp231taken on American accents . They said , " I wan na " and " I gudda " and " I 'm tryanna " and " I du n no " and " Whatcha doin " and " Whaa ? " The popular songs helped . I heard a little girl named Msonko sing , " Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  --  " Miss Natwick wrote to the minister of education . She got no reply . There was no minister of education . There would n't be one until July . " No one 's in charge , " she said . " They 've just shut up shop . " " Flew the coop is more like it . " " Blimy , the way you Yanks talk . " " Suspended animation , " I said . " Politically . " " Ward Rockwell is very well-spoken though , " she said . " But you 're as bad as the students . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in charge ! I was headmaster ! Of course the students overdid the lingo ; but it was also a political act . They had been taught by the British to say " Pardon " and " chaps " and " My singlet is very tatty . " They had learned expressions like " It 's jolly hard " and " He 's a cheeky devil " and " Pull your socks up "  --  and they did n't wear any . The country was about to become independent , and so learning to talk American was a way of getting even with the British . They did n't hate the British . They hardly knew them . They were somewhat beaten and bewildered , and they felt their country was a flop  --  they knew they were in the bush  --  and so they blamed their confusion on the British . When they were angry , which was usually when they were drunk , they could be very self-pitying and abusive . But the antagonism did not go very deep . It was simple , I knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of colonialism meant that they had woken up and found the world very large . Being poor was only part of it . They felt small and weak . And every day they were reminded of this by big strong Americans . It had probably been a good thing that the British ignored them . We took them seriously , but the gulf between us seemed to make them very sad . They did not know what to do or where to go . And then it occurred to me that we were tempting them . " I want to go to the United States , " Deputy Mambo said . " I want to go to Kansas City . " Kansas City was always mentioned in songs.  | " And Pasadena . " That was a new one on me . " Mr. Rockwell is from Pasadena . He says there are no Africans there . That 's why I want to go . " Willy Msemba wanted to go to New York . It was the setting of My Gun Is Quick . He wanted to meet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said we were leaving next year and that they would be running the school . " I want to go to your country , " Deputy Mambo said . I did not believe he was serious . It was temptation  --  a moment of envy and fantasy . I could not imagine why anyone would want to leave Africa . Was it because they had no novelty in their lives ? It was the curse of being poor  --  monotony . And so they were attracted by anything new . Language was one such novelty : the American way . They had started saying " Lemme see " and " I wan na do it " and  --  frequently  --  " I gudda get outa here , " meaningNyasaland . They were eager to learn . I was still an English teacher , although I had taken over all the headmaster 's duties . But being headmaster was no burden . I had discovered early in my life that promotion made life easier . It was simpler to be a headmaster than a teacher , better to be a teacher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the janitor 's . Eddyson Chimanga , the pigeon man , had the longest hours , the heaviest work , and the worst pay . Teaching English was a sort of penance I performed . The American way of speaking was picked up by the girls at the Beautiful Bamboo , too . All of them now spoke English fairly well , and most of them were better at it than my students  --  a bigger working vocabulary , full of exotic items . Faak . Saak . Beech . Sheet . Bustud . Demmit . Deets . Breek . Us whole . Shoo ting . It was not only the Peace Corps Volunteers who took them home ; it was also their listening to popular songs in a concentratedway . I wan na hold your hand , they said . And , Whuddle I do when you 've gone and left me . In a short time just months  --  the American language had spread widely and taken hold . If you do n't like it , an African girl said to me one night at the Bamboo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laughed . Perhaps this was what it was like to have children and watch them grow . They were learning.  |p233Lemme  get this thing off It was Margaret , a thin Angoni girl , struggling with her dress and doing a little two-step as she danced out of it . It always excited and amazed me to see how women 's clothes looked so small and shriveled when they took them off . A man 's made a bulky mound , but a woman 's were no more than a tiny heap , and insubstantial , like a shucked-off snakeskin . Hey , cut it out ! she said . Not so fast ! Gim me a chance ! I suspected that the students too spoke that way and for the same reason  --  because they liked us . They wanted to imitate us . They were lonely . They really did want to get out of the country . It made our jobs as teachers easier , and it enlivened every weekendfor me . It was very pleasant to be liked . To be conspicuous and liked was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young and far from home : I belonged here . It was the easiest place in the world to be . All week I was headmaster , and then on weekends I walked into the Bamboo with a buzz of excitement , thinking : Whatever I want .. . I still spent Friday night with one , and Saturday night with another , and Sunday with a third . Rockwell said he had heard that some volunteers were picking up girls in town and taking them home . " How can people do that ? " I said , " Are you saying that we 're just exploiting them ? That we 're not giving anything back ? " " That 's the opposite of what I mean , " he said . " They 're exploitingus . All we do is give . " He rneant his latrine . " All they do is take . " I said , " We 're not doing much for them . This is an experience for us . They 're not getting much in return . " " They love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was always his most annoying characteristic . " You probably take African girls home with you . " I said nothing . I concealed everything from him  --  everything I did . And I concealed it from everyone else . It was important , it was my strength , that no one knew anything about my secretIife ; that way the did not know Inc at all.  | " This is an experience for us , ' " Rockwell said . " You sound so grateful . " " I am grateful . Ward , we could be in Vietnam . " " I 'm four-F on account of my feet , so speak for yourself , " he said . " Listen , they 've got incurable diseases . Hookworm , eyeworm , bilharzia , malaria , sleeping sickness . " " You do n't get those from screwing , Ward . " " They 've got the clap . We had a movie about it in training . " " Oh , dry up . " " You 're going to get the crud . " Everyone said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not that kind of place . It was innocent , it was new . We were still children , all of us . That was perhaps why it seemed such an odd experience , at times a kind of frenzy , and to an outsider like Rockwell it must have looked like insanity . It had become such a habit that I hated to be alone . Sex was an expression of friendship : in Africa it was like holdinghands . There were times when I felt uncomfortably that it was exploitation , but then I thought : How could it be ? It was friendly and fun . There was no coercion . It was offered willingly . " You like me ? " Boopy said . " I like you , sister . " " You buy me beer ? " " I buy you two beers , sister . " " You take me home ? " " I take you home right now , sister . " " That is better , " she said , and pinched me with her skinny fingers . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the easiest thing in the world , and now that I had moved out of my house in Chamba and was living in the African township of Kanjedza I felt I was practically on equal terms with the girls . Equality itself was a new thing . But I also tried to please them . I was gallant and attentive . I was very grateful . In Nyasaland these were novelties , which was why I was such a success . I was not imposing a system on them , I was simply attaching myself to their system and trying to treat them fairly . These African girls had been kicked out of their villages . I was far from home , too . I used to imagine that I had attained a kind of maturity , andp235I knew I was very lucky . I thought : This is the right time , this is the right place , and I know it . It is all happening now . I was headmaster ; I had a little responsibility , and a little power . And there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was very satisfying . Everything seemed to be working perfectly . My weeks were full . After the busy weekend I went seriously about my duties at the school . I woke early and cycled up to Chamba through the dripping steepness of pines that had been planted by Her Majesty 's Forestry Commission . I conducted morning assembly and taught my classes and answered memos . If someone forgot to do something , I did it . The chimbuzi was rising . If I asked anyone to do anything the answer was yes . They always said yes . The students said yes . The people at Kanjedza said yes . The African girls said " okay " and that meant everything . One Tuesday at the end of May I was teaching my English class and felt a tickling at the end of my penis . The lesson was gerunds and participles . I sat down behind my desk , still talking , and covertly touched myself . Was my underwear too tight ? " And gerunds include words like touching , tickling and rubbing . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noun . Take itching . ' The itching was driving him crazy . ' What 's the subject of that sentence ? Miss Malinki ? " I stood up , wrote the sentence on the blackboard , and was stung again . But when I sat behind my desk to touch it I only made it worse . But touching also gave me little moments of relief . " Squeezing ' is a gerund , too . Not They were squeezing the banana '  --  that 's a verb . But Squeezing is something that often produces pain . ' " And I squeezed . It was agony . My penis was limp and overheated , and pinching it made it raw . " Excuse me . " I hurried to the chim . It had walls but no roof yet , though it really had begun to look like The Alamo . And because all the pipes were in it was usable . Rockwell was nowhere in sight , and I assumed he was taking his math class . I swayed and pissed razor blades , but the pain did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bladder . Pinchingmy penis brought tears to my eyes and yet I felt it would relieve the itch . " Anything wrong , Andy ? " That startled me . Rockwell was above me , laying brick , his head and shoulders above the end wall . " Of course not , " I said . Had he seen the flame colored rosette at the tip of my dick ? " I think this is coming along real good , if I do say so myself . " He disappeared , and I heard his boots on the rungs of theladder . I tried to leave , but he met me at the door and begangesturing with his trowel . " Notice how I staggered the joists and reinforced the supports ? That 's for added strength . And what do you think about the returns on those corners ? " He wanted to talk . He propped himself against the door , blocking my way , and drew my attention to the hardwood beams . " They look great , " I said . My penis was on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something you could adapt . You 're probably wondering why I did n't make it look like an African hut , with mock-mud walls and a thatched roof . " I had been wondering  --  and what was the point of making a traditional American design , the primitive Spanish look of Fort Alamo ? But I wanted to scratch myself . " I 'm not wondering , Ward . Excuse me . " He did n't hear . Bores are always deaf . " See , the point is they never had sanitary facilities before . Chimbuzi , as I understand it , just means latrine  --  well , we 're just talking about a trench . " " It 's beautiful . " " I 'm not asking you how it looks , " he said , somewhat offended . " I 'm also talking about strength and durability . " " It 's the best chiinbuzi in Nyasaland . " " Do n't put me on . " I wanted to claw the itch out of my penis . I said , " Ward , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still a shithouse . Do n't get carried away . Did you join the Peace Corps to build shithouses ? " He set his face at me . I frowned at him . I was perspiring ; my penis throbbed . " You 're a very moody guy , " lie said.  | " I have to get back to my class ! " But he was deaf . " Hey , if I can say after two years in Africa that I managed to accomplish one thing  --  and even if that one thing is a sanitary facility , I 'll be very proud . Now you 're probably saying to yourself , Hey  --  ' I was saying to myself : I once thought that . It was as though in his wordy way he was satirizing me . And God I was in pain . " Later ! " I said , and ran into my office . I slammed the door and massaged my penis , trying to ease it . But the tickle , which had become an itch , was now a fiery agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not visible , it was within me . It did not occupy a large space . It did not need to . It hurt like a sliver of blue flame . And as the hours passed it was like something molten , a hot pellet was forming in a vein of fire , and when I tried to soothe it I succeeded only in enlarging it and extruding it through the length of my penis . The pain was intense . I could not think of anything else . I went back to my classroom and told them to start an essay , using as many gerunds as possible ; and then I sat in my office and suffered . The other effect , just as bad , was that it deadened my penis . And it was worse than dead  --  it was desecrated , mocked and humiliated . It was useless  --  impossible to erect , forever limp , and unimaginably painful to piss with . It could not function , and I hated myself for the euphonious phrase that it was neither a hose nor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot noodle . I imagined that it had turned black . I expected it to drop off . I tried to keep myself from clawing it , and yet  --  sitting there in my office  --  it felt as insignificant as a piece of string . I was reminded of how important I regarded it . It was essentialto me . Now it was inflamed and unusable , and I knew that something had gone seriously wrong . I was depressed . I canceledmy afternoon class so that I could sit in my office and worry . I wanted to peek at it , I kept having urges to look . Rockwell was still bricking in the latrine , so I went behind the filing cabinetsand unzipped and took the sore thing in my hands . It was soft and swollen and looked mangled , like a half-cooked sausage.  | " Mr. Parent ? " Miss Natwick had toppled in , flourishing a copybook . " I think we have a plagiarist in the Fifth Form . " " Just checking the paintwork here , " I said . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she immediately became suspicious . " The paintwork ? " she said in an incredulous way . She stepped beside me as I finished stuffing the sore thing into my fly . I hitched up my trousers . I hated my penis . To divert Miss Natwick I knelt and began looking at the wall with regretful scrutiny . " There 's nothing wrong with the paintwork , " she said , in a way that suggested that there was something wrong with me . " It 's raw , it 's been scorched , it 's all coming apart . If you scratch it the whole thing will collapse . I just noticed it this morning . It 's like an infection  --  " What was I talking about ? I think Miss Natwick knew . She narrowed her eyes at me and made pitying lips . She seemed disgusted when she left . Then I looked again . I was leaking . Growing up , I had been taught to regard sickness and disease as something I had brought on myself . I was to blame for whateverillness I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the ailment . I had a cold because I had gone out without a hat , or had gotten my feet wet . I had a toothache because I ate candy and did n't brush regularly . It was a terrible equation , because whenever I was sick I was made to feel guilty . Now I had the clap . This was the ultimate penalty and it was peculiarly appropriate . The very organ I had misused was now blazing with infection . It was like being struck dumb tier te  --  llinp239a lie , or blinded for staring at something forbidden . The clap was not merely a disease  --  it was a judgment on me . That was what I had been taught . But I resisted it . I knew better than to think that this was a moral fault . It was a physical ailment , not a blot on my soul . It was germs . You killed them and then you were cured . I told myself that it was simply an inconvenience . And yet the guilt remained . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps found out I could be sent home . It was not only that I was a blunderer , I was also a health hazard . But I was too far from the capital to see the Peace Corps doctor that day . I would not have seen him in any case . I did n't want it on my record . It had to be concealed : another secret . The small hospital in the town of Zimba was called The Queen Elizabeth . I had taken a student there for stitches once : EmergencyOutpatient . It had been a five-hour wait for him . I went there late that same afternoon , grimly cycling . Ahead of me on the pewlike benches of Emergency Outpatient were twenty wounded and ailing Africans . On one bench alone , there was a sniveling child in a bloodstained shirt , a man with a slashed neck , another with a swollen bandaged foot , a woman with yellow liquid leaking from her bulging eye , a small whimpering girl clutching her head , and a young man with smashed toes  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stink of infection and rags  --  and the pain was audible in the gasps and sighs . I did not feel so ill here . I sat , determined not to touch my aching penis . When she spotted me , the nurse at the table in front beckoned me forward and told me I had come to the wrong place . She did not say so , but I knew that it was because I was white . It was unheard-of for a mzungu to come here . " I have to see the doctor . " " What is wrong , bwana ? " " It is my leg , sister , " I said in her language . She smiled at that  --  perhaps she guessed I was lying ?  --  and said , " Mr. Nunka will see you when he is free . " " These other people were here before me . " " They can wait . " " They 're sick . " Shc wagged her head . " They are used to waiting . "  |p240It  was unfair , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A seam of pain ran from my throat to my penis . " Room Three , " the nurse said . On the way down the corridor , it began to throb again . I tried to wring its neck , and tears sprang to my eyes . Mr. Nunka was washing his hands in Room Three . His backwas turned to me . Drying his hands , he glanced at the slip ofpaper the nurse had given me and he said , " Injury to leg . " I was closing the door to the room as he turned to face me . " Doctor , " I said . " I am not a doctor , " he said . " I am a medical assistant . LivingstoneNunka is my name . Go on . " " It 's not my leg , " I said . Not a doctor  --  did he know anything ? " There 's something wrong with my penis . I mean , inside it . " " Any discharge ? " I nodded . " Sort of greeny-yellow . " " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Chinsonono . " I glanced around , thinking he was calling the orderly . But he smiled and repeated the word , and I knew he was describing my condition . " Gonorrhea . " " Are you sure ? " " It must be , " he said . " Have you been going about with Africangirls ? " " Yes . Now and then . " He threw his handtowel into a laundry basket and opened a cabinet over the sink . " When did you last have contact ? " " Sunday . " " Excuse me for asking these questions . And before then ? " " Saturday . " " Any other times ? " " Friday . " He smiled and removed a large jar of tablets from the cabinet . " She is probably a carrier . " " They , " I said , and cleared my throat . " It was n't the same girl . " Now he looked directly at inc. but he was no longer smiling.  | " Three girls , " I said . " African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chinsonono was very common , and he tipped some of the white tablets from the jar onto a square of paper and counted them . " How do you know it 's not syphilis ? " " It might be , but syphilis is much rarer . Anyway , these will cure syphilis too . And any other infections you have . " He was printing on the label . " Do n't worry . The symptoms will clear up in a few days . It will be gone in week . " " I 've heard of gonorrhea being incurable . " " Not in Nyasaland . " " I was thinking of Vietnam . " " That is a different story . " " Do n't you think you should examine me ? " " It is not necessary , " he said . " But take all the tablets . Do n't stop taking them just because the symptoms go away . You must finish the course . And it 's a good idea not to drink alcohol or milk . " He plunged a hypodermic into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What for ? " " If I give you an injection of penicillin it will get started a little quicker , " and he stabbed my shoulder . When he was done I said , " How much do I owe you ? " " Nothing . It is free . This is Emergency Outpatient  --  no charge . " " I 'd like to give you something . " I was embarrassed : he had made it so easy for me . Already I felt better . I wanted him to ask for a bribe . " You can come by and help me someday . " " I would n't know what to do ! " " Just orderly work . We are so understaffed . " " I do n't have any training . " " I do n't have much myself , " Mr. Nunka said . " But you can be useful . " The leak stopped the next day , and then the itching . But it was still sore . It felt useless  --  not dead but battered and limp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its personality and so had 1 . No dick , no drinking  --  it was strange . At school I thought :  |p242I  have no secrets , I am exactly what I seem . One whole side of my existence had vanished . I was surprised that people treated me the same . I felt bored and simple and rather unfunny . Jokes annoyed me . But I was grateful to be cured . On the following Saturday , conscious that I was repaying a debt , I went to The Queen Elizabeth and asked for Mr. Nunka . " You are better , " he said . He had confidence in his medicine . And I was thankful that he did not browbeat me . The Peace Corps doctor would have given me a lecture and made me feel guilty . He would have taken the view that I had caught the clap because I had done something I should n't have . But that was not true  --  I had done nothing wrong . I had merely been unlucky . But this African so-called savage was enlightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a germ and he had killed it  --  a simple matter . I was glad to be dealing with Africans . I was so reassured by his attitude I thought I might never go home . The cure left me feeling as I had some years before , when I had gone to confession : purer , cleaner , in a state of grace . I was healthy again . Today was Saturday but I had no plans to go to the Beautiful Bamboo . " I came here to help you . " " Put this on , " Mr. Nunka said , and gave me an orderly 's green smock . It was stiff with starch . I imagined assisting at operations , handing him a scalpel , holding a tray of instruments . He would pass me a newborn baby and I would lay the infant in a cradle and whisper to the mother It 's a boy . Mr. Nunka led me down a dirty corridor that smelled of disinfectantand we entered a crowded ward . " The volunteers do n't come here anymore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europeans who worked as hospital visi-tors . " " Why do n't they come ? " " They left the country , " he said . " They were frightened of what would happen at Independence . " " But nothing has happened . " " We are not independent yet , " Mr. Nunka said . Did that mean anything ?  |p243Most  of the whites had gone , though . That was why The Nyasaland Trading Company was so empty and the reason the Blantyre Sports Club was closing . The tea was not being picked , the ministries were closed . " They used to wash the patients , " Mr. Nunka said . There were forty-seven males , old and young , in the ward , but only thirty beds . The ones without beds slept on the floor . I mentioned this to Mr. Nunka . He said , " They are used to it . " " They look sick , " I said . " They need baths , " Mr. Nunka said . He brought me a big enamel basin and a bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us to do this  --  one to prop the patient up , the other to scrub . We took off their pajamas and went at it , sloshing their heads first , then their arms , their torso , and lower , the disgusting rest . The first few made me retch , but then someone turned on the radio , and it played The Drifters ' song " Saturday Night at the Movies , " and I thought of Abby at the Rainbow Cinema . We washed a few more men , and after a while it was like scrubbing furniture . The old African men simply lay there and groaned while we soaped them . Several of them were full of tubes and catheters and it required a certain amount of care to wash them . One of the sickest , and hardest to wash , was a man called Goodall . While we were doing him I thought : Maybe Abby gave me the clap ? But then the radio played a new song , Elvis 's " Return to Sender , " and I forgot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him carefully , cleaning him like an antique . He stank , and his skin was like a lizard 's , rather cold and slippery , with white flakes and scales . But I had the impression that he was enjoying his bath  --  he smiled faintly as he felt the warm water on him  --  and his pleasure took away my nausea . " All these tubes , " I said . " Strictures have formed in his urethra , " Mr. Nunka said , and he whispered , " He has been a martyr to gonorrhea for sixty years . When we came to the last bed and washed the old man in it and the one underneath I had a view of the Outpatient Clinic . I was scrubbing a foot  --  I had the battered thing under my arm  --  and I saw a familiar figure walking up the gravel path  --  Gloria , heading for Emergency . She wore her red dress and ap244red turban , very stylish for the hospital ; but she looked rather gray and gloomy . I simply watched her as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long wait  --  there was the usual crowd of desperate people waiting to be seen . " What about a cup of tea ? " Mr. Nunka said , when we had finished . I did not have the tea habit , and this tea was the color of the bathwater in the basin , a resemblance that turned my stomach . But the Staff Room was adjacent to the clinic , and I sat there and read an old issue of The Central African Examiner so that I could watch Gloria . She was on a bench near the wall of health posters . Perhaps she was reading Toby Toothbrush says , " Use me every day ! " or In Case of Burns  --  first aid in pictures . " Busy day . " " Every day is busy , " Mr. Nunka said . " Goodall seems a nice guy . " " That old man is an institution . He is a chief of the Sena people , on the Lower River . " " He seems to be in terrible pain . " " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips like a fish and sucked his tea noisily . How could he , in a such a smelly place ? But it seemed he did not notice . He said , " I want a packet of biscuits , and then I must do some bandages . I will find you here . " I waited until I saw Gloria stand up , hearing her name being called . She was treated by someone I could not see , behind a curtain . After she had gone , clutching her bottle of tablets , I discovered why she had come . It said so on the medical record that was flung into the tray for filing . Her name was given as Lundazi Gloria . She had gonorrhea . This aroused me  --  not the disease , but the fact that she was being cured . So was I ! As far as I knew , we were the only two people in the country who were being treated for the clap . It made me amorous . In a week we would be completely cured ; we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted desire , and with it came a renewed feeling of mingled optimism and secrecy . But I did not follow her . " There was always time . Mr. Nunka returned and we washed more patients ; bandagedp245some burns and emptied Goodall 's bottles . It was cold in the men 's ward , which dulled the smell somewhat but caused the men to bury themselves in their ragged blankets . A light rain spattered the windows . At the end of the day , Mr. Nunka said , " It was very good of you to help us here . I hope we will not see you again . " He meant I think  --  they often confused the English words when there was only one word in Chinyanja . " Why not ? " " We do n't have money to pay you . " That did it . I said , " I 'll be back tomorrow . " The next day I worked alone , washing the old men again . I realized that I would have to wash them a few more times before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . They were so dirty that one or two baths were not enough to get the grime off . Goodall said , " Be careful , father . Do n't hurt me . " I kept at it and when I finished the old chief was clean , perhaps for the first time in years . His skin was shining . He smiled . But the bath had tired him ; he lay back on his raised pillows and went to sleep . The men were so silent and inert and uncomplaining it really was like washing furniture . There were stitched-up legs and snakebites and thick plaster casts and wounds being drained . I took care to wash around the obstructions . I had spent the day alone here , and when the rain started at five , and I switched on the feeble orange lights  --  three bulbs in the ceiling  --  I slopped an old African 's skinny arm in my basin . A big fly was buzzing and bonking against a window , trying to get out . It stank of sickness here , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was happy . During the week at Chamba Hill Secondary School , I was fully alert and got more done than I ever had . I had never felt so rested . I had had nothing to drink , I had n't brought any girls home over the weekend ; I had spoken only to Captain . He told me he believed there were monsters in the Shire River . One he described resembled a whale-sized snake that could wrap itself around the ferry and sink it . Instead of setting him straight , I encouraged him , and he described more monsters . I listened and felt virtuous , which was also a sense of physical well-being.  |p246I  was cured of the clap and living one life . Still , I thought of Gloria , taking her penicillin . The following Saturday after lunch I went back to the hospital . Mr. Nunka said , " You are on your own again today , father . The other orderly has returned to his village for the weekend . " I did n't mind . I filled the basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's ward . It was harder and slower alone , because I had to prop them on pillows before I could scrub them . But I managed . When I came to Goodall 's bed I saw that he was not in it . Instead , there was a sullen man who had been on the floor . He was very ugly , which had the effect of making him look strong . " Where is the old man ? " " They took him away . " He did not sound sorry : he was glad now to have a bed . But he saw I did not understand . He said very plainly , " He died yesterday . " I stood holding the dripping rag . " Wash me , " the African said , and sat up . " Wash yourself . " " I am sick , " he said in a harsh complaining voice . " Sorry , father . " I was ashamed of myself for ever having felt virtuous . I handed the man my wet rag . I did not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did it badly  --  I could not see the point of doing it well or being thorough . They did n't notice , nor did Mr. Nunka . I had wet the men , that was all . And then I saw in my reaction to Goodall 's death that I had been doing this for myself , not for them . And a bath did n't save anyone from death . That night I went to the Beautiful Bamboo . I drank beer and waited , watching Gloria dance . " Come home with me , " I said at midnight . She did not say anything about having had the clap . Mr. Nunka had told me to use a rubber . " African girls , " he had said . But a rubber was superfluous . I was certain that we were both cured . Gloria said , " I love you , " in English . It did not mean anything . They were just the words to a song . Yet I felt very tender towards her , and held her closely , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to feel relieved about being alive.  |p247Out  of superstition , and because I had been ill and disappointed , I only saw Gloria now . She said , " I can be your wife . " It did n't mean much : your wife , your woman . It was the same word , like month and moon , or man and husband , and even the words for marry and copulate were close  --  kwata and kwatanabecauseboth meant joining . " Kapena , " I said . Maybe . Like the other girls she lived behind the Beautiful Bamboo ; all the disgraced girls , the rebels and runaways , in one hut . She sometimes stopped by my house in Kanjedza , but not before sending a small child ahead . " The woman in the red dress wants to visit you . " I always said yes , though during the week this was inconvenient . I had my teaching to do , my copybooks to mark , and lessonsto prepare . I had my headmaster 's paperwork junior staff salaries , supplies and allowances , letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read and the attendance book to keep . One day , when the country had a government and an Education Ministry a school inspector might visit Chamba Hill . Miss Natwick saw me dealing with the papers . She said , " Bumf ! " I had never heard the word before . She saw I was bewildered . " Bum fodder , " she explained , in her Rhodesian snarl . She took delight in seeing how I had to stay late at the school . I was always in my office , even after sundown , working through the files by the light of the sizzling Tilly lamp . I was not the only person there , however . Rockwell was often straddling the chimbuzi , and laboring , as I cycled back to Kanjedza . These days he would not let anyone near it , not even to use it . We reopened the trench near the blue gums . Ile had taken over the entire construction of the than.  | " Do it yourself , " he said . " That 's the only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost done . " " I had seepage in my urinals , " he said . " I 've got to lick these urinals . " Late one afternoon , when the whole school had emptied , I found him climbing the scaffold to resume the work his teaching had interrupted . I walked over to watch him . He ignored me at first , and then he accused me of trying to undermine him by giving him an extra math class . " It was Form Four  --  full of wise guys . I thought they 'd be helping you make bricks . " " Hah ! Your big mistake ! Thought you could punish them by forcing them to make bricks . You thought you 'd get a good latrine . " He smiled at me , and I thought how seldom it was in life that a smile was a sign of pleasure . Rockwell 's was always something else . " But because it was punishment they made bad bricks . Anyonecould have told you that . What did I do with them ? " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxioushe always asked questions , and waited until I was exasperated , and then answered them . " I threw every single darn one of them away . " Even his laugh was not a laugh . I said , " Where did all these bricks come from then ? " " Punishment 's no good , " he said , taking his time . " You 've got to motivate people properly and do things right . Then they take a pride in their work . " " How are you motivating people , Rockwell ? " " There 's only one motivation  --  " He started to smile , but he abandoned it when I shouted . " You 're paying them ! " " It 's not much , " he said , enjoying my anger . " But look at the result . " He patted the top of the Alamo wall . " Now , see , there 's a good-quality brick . " I was against paying anything to anybody . One of the satisfactionsI took in the country was that money did not matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niinka had cured Inc h ip249nothing . There were no school fees . And what was I earning ? Fifty dollars a month . " No more paying . " " You 're so arrogant . " He pronounced it eeragant and it did n't sound so bad . " I 'm the headmaster here , Ward . I can get you transferred . I 'll call Ed Wently . You 'll be back in Sierra Leone , watching people go to the bathroom in the street . " He was silent : the prospect clearly worried him . " Doing wee-wee and poo-poo on the sidewalk . " " Cut it out , Parent ! " " Anyway , where are you getting the money ? " " It 's charity . My church sent it . " He had nails in his mouth . As he talked he removed a nail and pounded it into a roof shingle . " The Tenth Street Tabernacle in Rosemead . " It was the first time he had mentioned his church ; but I should have known . " They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect money from a variety night  --  Show for Souls . They dole it out , so that we can spread the word of the Lord Jesus , and "  --  and drew out a nail and slammed it into a shingle  --  " have Bible study in distant lands . " " This is n't Bible study . " He stared down at me . " It 's a latrine , " I said . " Still , it 's in a distant land , " he said , and blinked furiously . " What if your church knew you were hiring Africans to build a shithouse ? " " All the Africans are doing is making the bricks , " he said , andthen in a lordly way . " I 'm building the structure itself . " " Playing God with your chimbuzi . You should tell them . " " I think they 'd be glad the money was going to a good cause . " " Shall I tell them ? " He saw that I was angry . He said he would n't pay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he was nearly done with the thing and probably did n't need any more bricks . " I 'm done for the day , " he said . I is made his way down the ladder , and I saw that his chin had an odd pinkness , as of a burn  --  it looked bald and scalded . " Did you hurt yourself ? Your chin looks red . "  | " Nah . Just an experiment . " He put his hand on his chin . " Leave me alone . I 'm sick . I 've got mucus in my stool . " I worked late every day and then bicycled two miles downhill through the dripping pine forest , to Kanjedza . The little boy was usually there . " The woman in the red dress wants to visit you . " She had immense patience . It was African patience . It had something to do with having plenty of time . It was not indifference , but it was close  --  the mood of someone who lived in a country where not much ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the poise of a bird on a branch . She could sit in a roosting way all day , waiting , doing nothing . Miss Natwick said they behaved that way because Africans were bloody lazy . The Peace Corps told us that Africans had parasites and as a result were very sleepy  --  the germs , worms , ticks , and amoebas all slowed them down . But in Gloria 's case it might have been something else . She said she was in love with me . One night she said , " I am visiting my father . He is sick . " " Where is your village ? " " Will you let me show you ? " I could not say no . In that way she got me to agree to go with her . We took the bus from Zimba to Blantyre and left from there on an old black steam train . It was slow-moving and it stopped at every station . On some hills the engine gasped and went silent , and the whole train rolled backwards , unable to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoked until he had built up enough steam for the train to go up and over . At noon we arrived at the hot flat town of Balaka . There were baobab trees , fat and gray , like misshapen elephants . There was no shade . The rest of the country was cold and drizzly , but this low-lying town was stricken with sun . The main street was a narrow track of pale dust . " Where are you going , Mister Undie ? " She had started calling me that . " Back to the station for a timetable . " It was an old habit . I never arrived in a place without thinking that very soon , perhaps sooner than I thought , I would want top251leave . I always needed an escape route , no matter how contentedI was . The timetable was chalked on the station wall . I copied it into my notebook . We found a bar and sat in its shadows eating chicken and rice out of tin bowls . People stared at us  --  the white man , the African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her red dress and high heels . Her village was nearby  --  walking distance . She took off her shoes for the hike . When we were alone on the road I realized I had nothing to say to her . But she did not notice . Silence was another aspect of her patience . Suddenly she stopped , knelt down and put her shoes on . I soon saw why . There were mud huts ahead , the grass roofs showing through the stunted trees . The entrance to the village was through a pair of fat baobabs  --  a sort of gateway . The huts were rounded and brown , like a certain kind of bread , and cracked in the same way , walls like crusts . There were about a dozen chubby huts . Naked dirty boys followed us . She knew them : Winston , Snowdon , Blair , Baldwin , and her small brothersRedson and Walton . Some women yodeled when they saw us . It was the usual gleeful greeting in Nyasaland . Then they began chattering with Gloria in a language I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served a meal  --  porridge and stew . It made no difference that I had already eaten . Food was friendship here . Gloria seemed absorbed by the women , and then she brought me a bottle of beer , and some dry cookies , and at last a basin of water . I washed my hands . " They want you to rest . " She was speaking for the women behind her . " I must go and see my father . " They were so eager for me to rest , I agreed , to please them . They brought me to an empty hut , and I lay on the string bed . The walls were dry mud and the floor smooth earth and the air heavy with dust . Dirt flakes sifted down from the thatch . Just lying there made my breathing difficult and I began to wheeze . I sneaked out and saw why they had wanted me to have a nap : the whole village was asleep  --  no one stirred . It was the hottest hour of the day , two o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes , it lay upon me ,  |p252and  I had to struggle against it in order to walk . I left the sleeping village and followed a path . Yet when I had gone too far I saw that it was not a path , but a furrow in a field . The furrow grew shallower , and then was gone , and I was lost . I came to another path , another furrow . It led to a field of broken-down corn shucks , and before I had gone twenty feet a shadow beneathme came alive  --  a long black snake , as thick as a garden hose . It scraped on the corn shucks as it slid past my feet . A superstition in Nyasaland said that a person had to turn back if a snake crossed his path . I did so , and went in the opposite direction . Five steps later I saw another snake  --  much bigger than the last one , and blacker . I imagined that there were nests of black mambas beneath all these corn shucks . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide , snake-infested field . I picked up a stick and beat the shucks ahead of me in order to frighten the snakes . I had a dread of stepping on the creatures . After almost two hours of this I came to the road of pale dust . It was growing dark when I found my way back to Gloria 's village . " My father wants to see you , " she said . " His name is Max-well . " No one asked where I had been . Maxwell lay in a cot , in the largest hut in the village . He looked much sicker even than any of the men I had bathed at The Queen Elizabeth , and I was sure he was dying . It was a bare room . There was no medicine near him , only a glass of water and a Bible . I watched him for a moment . Perhaps he was dead already ? His voice came gasping out of the stillness . " Are you saved ? " I said I did n't know . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would know if you were . There was a long silence , during which I realized that he had spoken to me in English . Finally , I said , " I thought you wanted to talk . " " If you 're not saved I have nothing to say to you . " Gloria was waiting for me outside . She seemed stupid and eager . She took my hand and led me away . She did not mention her father.  |p253She  said , " Tonight I will come to your hut . It will be easy . You are sleeping with my two small brothers . " I was shocked . First the father 's Are you saved ? and then the daughter 's plan to make love in the same room where her two brothers were sleeping , the little naked boys , Redson and Walton . Seeing that I was hesitant she said , " You were once such a dog that you took me and that little girl home with you and you screwed both of us . " That was true , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reminded of it . I believed that I had changed a bit , but when I was forced to think about it I saw that I had not changed at all . I said , " What if the kids wake up ? Do you want them to see us ? " " They never wake up . " " I ca n't screw in the same room with children , sister . " " They are used to it . " " And your father would hate it if he knew . You did n't tell me he 's a religious man . " " He is so foolish . These village people are primitive "  --  she said " primitive " in English  --  " They do n't know anything . " " I am a guest , so I have to behave myself . " " You are my guest , so you have to do what I say . " I had always thought she was submissive . What was this ? I said , " What do you want , sister ? " " Jig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near us . " They did n't sleep in beds . They had mats , which seemed to me much worse . The mats were beside the bed and under it . We would be screwing on top of them . " We can do it somewhere else , " she said . I thought of the snakes I had seen that afternoon . " Here , " she said . " My man . " We were standing beside a dead tree in the darkness , whispering . " There are snakes on the ground here . " " We will screw standing up , " she said . " Come near . Near . " The word was pa/n%ee  --  an easy word to say lewdly . I said no , but she insisted , and she got inc started with herp254rough hand . She leaned against the tree and held the hem of her dress . Then she balanced herself on an upraised root and we went at it like a couple of monkeys . When we were done I remembered that her father was dying in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted me again . Pafoopee , she said . All night I heard the two children snoring beneath my bed . I was wakeful , fearing that Gloria would come in . But she stayed away . She gave me a basin of water and a chunk of soap the next morning . No matter how thoroughly I washed I still felt filthy afterwards . Africans always looked clean . It was their secret . How did they manage to keep clean in mud huts ? I was very grubby , and having washed only my hands and face , the rest of my body itched . I did n't shave , and I was too unsure of the water to brush my teeth with it . But Gloria looked even worse than me . Her dress was dirty , and what was this dancing dress doing here ? The buttons down the hack were undone , and I could see the row of knucklebones on her spine . By the second day , which was Sunday , she looked very slovenly , and the other women and girls seemed embarrassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her dress was torn . She was oblivious of this . She said the other women got on her nerves . In the town of Zimba she was known as one of the stylish girls from the Beautiful Bamboo ; but in this little village she looked whorish and silly . The women were quiet and rather shy . They were solicitous towards me , urging me to stay in the shade and eat . They brought me African beer . It was sour , almost rancid , but I was flattered to be treated in a traditional way . Gloria said something which I was sure was , " He does n't drink that crap . " She told me to give one of her brothers some money to buy a bottle of Castle Lager in Balaka . I did n't want it , but rather than make a scene I gave in . " These people are stupid . " I thought what a horrible person she was and regretted that I had come . But I was ashamed of myself too , for the more I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me . Had I made her that way ? It was not that she was American/ized . She was n't that , by far . It was that she was a scold and a slob and very stupid . " The old man wants to see you again . " He lay in the darkness . " I have been thinking about you , " he said . That mattered to me and moved me . He was a wise man . Perhaps what I had sought in his daughter he would offer me . I imagined folk stories and proverbs , and memories of the settlers . He was over seventy , which meant he had been born in the nineteenth century . I looked upon his sunken face , this man from another age . He had been thinking about me . " Yes , you are lost , " he said . It seemed to me that he was chuckling . " You are damned . " I thought : That 's what everyone says . The mail train left Balaka at midnight . We boarded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inhaling coal smoke from the chimney . The insects shrieked at the open windows , from the black woods . Gloria was also sleeping . At one point she woke me up crying , " Help ! " She said it was not a nightmare but a song . I woke at dawn , as we drew into Blantyre . My back ached ; but I was glad , the sun was up , the air was cool . But when we walked to the bus depot I knew that something had changed between us . I had seen her village . She had been ashamed of it , ashamed of her father and the " primitive " people . She was distant with me now , as if I might make fun of her . I had seen her secret . She thought I knew too much . She said , " Bye-bye . " She never showed any affection in public , but then Africans in Nyasaland seldom did . She was going back to her life and I to mine . Rockwell was waiting in my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that his whole face was swollen . It was the same pinky bareness that his chin had been , but it was an entire mask of it . He gave me one of his hacking laughs that meant Watch out ! and told me that he had plucked some whiskers out of his chin and that had given him an idea . He wondered if he could do more . Over the weekend he had had nothing to do ( " Because you took the key to the tool shed with you , Parent , thanks a million " ) and had plucked all the hairs out of his upper lip , thep256mustache area . He had used a pair of tweezers . He said it hurt at first . " Then I thought what the heck . I started again yesterday and did my whole face . Hey , what if it does n't grow back ? " The African girls never talked about politics . There had been no mention of it in Gloria 's village . The British had gone , a black government was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in charge . It was not anarchy , it was peace . People walked in the road there were so few cars , and poor people put on their best clothes and went to get drunk , men in ties , women in dresses . Strangers talked to each other : " Hello , father , " " Hello , sister . " Everything was very simple . All the African girls seemed like one girl , uncomplicated and enthusiastic and pretty . I was probably no more than a white person to them , but a sympathetic one , and an American . I spoke the language , I knew how to make them laugh . One said , " I love you because you dance with us . " We were dancing to " Mrs. Brown You 've Got a Lovely Daughter . " Then the political talk was talk of independence . It was a kind of nervousness that trembled through the country  --  or at least through Zimba , and the Beautiful Bamboo Bar , and Chamba Hill Secondary School . It was like the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and fidget just before they hear the band . The day was only two weeks off . After morning assembly one day I had a visit from Deputy Mambo . He was wearing a red shirt , flapping shorts , and knee socks . He carried a stick . He also wore new shoes . Africans wearing new shoes always made me wary . They looked as though they wanted to kick something.  | " I must speak to you , " he said , and then added slyly , " Head-master . " " Come in , brother . Who are you supposed to be ? " " I am a Youth Leaguer , " he said . " I am organizing our studentsfor the independence celebration . " He did not seem to recognize me . It was as though he was peering dimly out of his uniform , sort of hiding behind it . " What does that badge say ? " It was a stiff embroidered disk pinned under his Doctor Banda button . " Chamba Youth League . " Chamba had a Youth League ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am telling you . We are arranging the independence . There will be flags , fireworks , demonstrations , and what-not . " " What are the students supposed to do ? " " March , " he said . " What if they 're busy ? " " They can not be busy . " This was a very different Deputy Mambo . I wanted to kick him out of my office . But it was not my independence celebration . I could not complain that no one had told me about the Chamba Youth League . It had probably begun on some weekend , when I had been attending to other things . That same afternoon two soldiers arrived in a Land-Rover . They wore khaki uniforms and polished combat boots . I took them for Germans . They said they were Israelis . Yonny was about my age ; the other one , Moosh , was a fat , older man . Deputy Mambo had sent them . They showed me a letter authorizingtheir visit . I said , " Mambo teaches Third Form geography  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volcano . No one gave him permission to invite the Israeli army to the school . Know what I mean ? " " You can check , " Moosh said , and turned his back on me . I called Ed Wently from the post office in Zimba after school , but while I was describing Mambo the Youth Leaguer and his Israelis , Wently said , " Play ball , " and hung up . I had never minded when Miss Natwick had implied I was incompetent as headmaster , and it had pleased Inc to see Rock/well take the latrine seriously . But Mambo in his red shirt I found disconcerting . It seemed he had a secret life , too . And the Israeli soldiers at what I considered my school irritated me . Apparently I could not get rid of them . Yonny tried to be friendly in a bullying soldierly manner . I said I did n't like soldiers marching around the school . He turned this into an antisemitic remark and said , " No one likes Israelis . " Yonny lisped . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Moosh was grumpy . One day he surprised me by saying that he liked to dance . This slob liked to dance ? But he showed me a few steps and for those seconds he was a different person , and very light on his feet . I complimentedhim and in return he criticized me for being friendly towards the students  --  too easy on them , he said . It was not long before they began criticizing Rockwell , too . They said they could not understand why he spent all that time shingling the building . Rockwell said , " Because I want to have it finished by Indepen-dence . " They wanted to know what the thing was . " Sanitary facilities . Rest rooms . " " It 's a latrine , " I said . " You Americans , " Yonny said , showing me his tongue when he lisped the word . Moosh said that this latrine was too good for Africans . " They can be happy with a hole in the ground . " " Ever hear of cholera ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Africa 's number one killer ? " Yonny said , " Human life means nothing here . " After school , the Israelis drilled the students , showed them how to march in step and twirl banners , and they screamed at them unmercifully . I heard the drums beating from the cleared piece of ground they called the football pitch . I asked a Fourth Former named Malenga what he thought of the Israelis . He used a word that he had once applied to Americans , that meant " skilled in everything " ( nkhabvu ) . " Give me an example . " Just today , Malenga said , the younger one Yonny had taught several of the boys how to get free of an enemy interrogator . While you were standing , facing each other , you looked himp259straight in the eyes and without blinking or moving your head you kicked him furiously and broke his shinbone . " They 're tough guys , " Malenga said . I hated Deputy Mambo for arranging the visit of these soldiers . But now I saw Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crazy and possibly dangerous , but in contrast to the Israelis Rockwell seemed a man of principle and good sense . He had his eccentricities , this toiletmaker from Pasadena , but beneathit all he had a humane mission . I had been too hard on him . While I had spent my weekends at the Bamboo Rockwell had put in extra hours on the latrine . He had just about finished the roof . On rainy days he worked inside , painting and tinkering . " I think I 've got these urinals licked , " he said , and then in a whisper , " Hey , what about these Israelites ? Are you going to let them push you around ? " " Wently told me to play ball . " " I got the name of the Israeli ambassador , " Rockwell said . " Are you going to report the soldiers ? " " No . The name spooked me . " Rockwell was still whispering . " Ambassador Shohat . Get it ? " I said no . He said , " Sometimes names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that Scotch guy that runs the Nyasaland Trading Company , Dalgliesh . " I said , " Ward , please  --  " " See , Lorne Greene is really lawn green . ' And Faye Dunaway  --  ' fadingaway ' . Huh ? You have to really think to get the message . " " What about Dalgliesh ? " " Dog leash , " Rockwell whispered . " And that guy Shohat is shoe hat . ' In other words , head to toe . It kind of worries me . " After revising my opinion of Rockwell , here he was again , getting weird . But I blamed the Israelis for this . I was putting in extra time as headmaster , to prove that I was still in charge . I stopped seeing Gloria and went back to taking the Bamboo girls home at weekends . On weekdays I started at seven , unlocked the buildings , met the teachers at seven-thirty , and then banged the piece of railway track to call the students to assenthly.  |p260In  the last week of June , Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of his red-shirt days  --  shorts , knee socks , badges . How could he wear that cruel face of Doctor Banda and not expect to scare me ? " I have a request , Mr. Headmaster , sir , " he said . He was always slavishly polite when he was being hostile . " About morningassembly . In addition to stories and what-not I suggest we sing a song for Kamuzu . " The man on his badge  --  Hastings Kamuzu Banda . " Which song ? " I said . " Everything Belongs . ' " I had never heard it . " How does it go ? " Deputy Mambo folded his arms across his Youth League shirt and put his head back and yelled the song in Chinyanja : Everything belongs to Kamuzu BandaAll the treesBelong to Kamuzu Banda All the hutsBelong to Karnuzu Banda All the cowsBelong to Kamuzu Banda All the roads .. " I get the idea , brother . " It was tuneful but ridiculous . " But I do n't think there 's much point in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reply . He moved his lips over his teeth and pressed them together , and he glared at me . I wondered whether the brown spots on the whites of his eyes meant he had a vitamin deficiency . I had not had any strong feelings about Mambo until he showed up in his red shirt and announced that he was a member of the Chamba Youth League . I could not forgive him for those two Israelis . I could hear them , even now , shrieking orders on the football pitch . I said , " The songs we sing are boring , but at least they 're harmless . " " We want Everything Belongs . ' " " And Banda  --  who is he ? "  |p261It  was just an expression  --  a rhetorical question . I knew who Banda was . But Deputy Mambo answered me . " He is our Ngwazi . " It meant conquerer . " And Chirombo . " It meant " great beast . " " Our messiah . " " Give me a break , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Founder and Father of the Malawi Congress Party . Life Presidentof our Motherland , Malawi . " " Look , brother  --  " " I am not your brother . I do not drink beers . I do not osculatewith town girls wearing tight dresses and ironing their hair . " I glared at him . I hated this , and yet I had been expecting itfor months . " As long as I am headmaster of Chamba Hill Secondary School we will not sing the ' Everything Belongs ' song . Is that clear ? " On the last day of June I was visited by a man who said he was from the Ministry of Education . He was English , and very pleasant . He said he liked the look of the school . No one ever praised the place , and I was grateful to this stranger . " I did n't realize Nyasaland had a Ministry of Education . " " It does n't , " he said . " I 'm with the Malawi Ministry of Educa-tion . " Hearing that gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're just getting sorted out , " he said . " We 're appointing headmasters to schools . " " Chamba has one , " I said , meaning myself . " Right you are , " he said , and consulted a file . " His name is Winston Mambo and he 's to take over immediately . " I made a little grunt of complaint . " Ca n't make much difference to you , old boy , " he said . " You 'll be gone in a matter of months . " " How do you know ? " Ile smiled and said , " You 're a bird of passage . " All the way hone I kept thinking of that expression.  |p262Mambo  moved into the office and I found a cubbyhole in the science block . He fired Miss Natwick , he gave the Israelis lockers in the Staff Room  --  I had denied them that  --  and he allowed them to join us for morning coffee . He started a Youth League branch for the Fifth Form and organized the lower forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with red shirts . His first morning assembly was typical of the ones that followed : a Bible reading , a passage from a speech by Doctor Banda , the song " Everything Belongs to Kamuzu Banda , " and a pep-talk . " He 's not even the official president yet , " Rockwell said . " This is still a British colony . " It was n't , but what Rockwell said was partly true . It was a much stranger situation than that . It was nothing , it was an interval , between the British leaving and the Africans taking over . But it was a short interval  --  a moment briefer than an eyeblink in the history of the country . For the whole of my time in the place so far no one had been in charge . The Africans were hopeful and they felt free . There was no government . Everything worked . Everyone belonged . But now I felt it was the end of the day and we all faced a long night . Mambo said , " We will run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Reading the Bible , dressing up in red shirts , singing about Kamuzu , following Israelis around the football pitch . The Africanway ! " " The Israelis are our friends . " I did not argue . I was glad to be relieved of the tedium of the headmaster 's duties  --  doing the register , keeping track of supplies , balancing the timetable . But with Mambo in charge the school almost immediately took on a preachy political tone , and Mambo  --  whom I knew to be a creep  --  became annoyingly pious . I saw that he had become headmaster not because he liked the school particularly but because he wanted something more . He was ambitious . This was his way of moving on . " We will have special independence celebrations at Chamba Hill Secondary , " he said . " Parades , demonstrations , cakes , and a bonfire . The minister will come and plant a tree in front of the chimbuzi. "  |p263This  was at the first staff meeting . " Wait a minute , " Rockwell said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted to accept this invitation from his former school . I have budgeted for a small blue-gum tree to plant . " " I built that latrine , " Rockwell said . " That 's all my work . I know you started it and provided some bricks , but I had to tear it down and start again from scratch . So it 's all mine . " " We want to give thanks for its completion , " Mambo said . " Then write to the Tenth Street Tabernacle and mention the Faith Fund of the Pageant for People Overseas . " Mambo was scowling at him with speckled eyes , and showing his full set of teeth . He had the appearance of an old-fashioned mechanical bank , the same meaningless mouth and cast-iron features . " It is our new school latrine . It must be inaugurated . " " I already inaugurated it , " Rockwell said : " It must be done properly , " Mambo said . " There 's only one way to inaugurate a latrine  --  and I did it , fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likoni arrived in his ministerial car . He used the road that had been trampled and cleared by students searching for tickeys . Not many months before , Mr. Likoni had begged to use my bicycle . Now he was in a new Mercedes . He had a driver . He wore a pin-striped suit and new shoes . He cut a red ribbon and planted a slender blue gum in front of the chimbuzi . He did not speak to me . He praised Chamba Hill Secondary and he praised Mr. Mambo . He led the students in the " Everything Belongs " song . That night I found Rockwell at the Beautiful Bamboo . It was his form of rebellion , he said . He had been there since noon . Thinking , he said . But he looked as though he had been crying . " What about ? " " Words , " he said . " I could never ask a girl her box number , could you ? " To prevent him from plunging in on that subject , I said , " You - Hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening a public toilet ! The minister cut the ribbon and made a speech . That guy used to borrow my bike . " " I Nvish I had a woman , " Rockwell said.  |p264I  turned and stared at the African girls seated at the tables , and dancing , and leaning against the wall , all of them watching us . " Funnily enough , I do n't think of them as women , " he said . He looked puzzled and alarmed . He said , " I 'd rather get drunk . " There were tears in his eyes . " I had a girlfriend . That was before I joined the Peace Corps . It did n't work out . If I was kissing her in her house and the phone rang , she always answered it , and she always talked about an hour . " He said nothing for a long while . The jukebox played Chuck Berry singing " Maybelline , " and then Elvis 's " Return to Sender " and then " Knockin ' On My Front Door " by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs was a crazy little mama . " If I met someone who did n't answer the phone at times like that I 'd marry her . " He put his head in his hands , and started to sob . But he was saying something . " What is it , Ward ? " He raised his red eye to me and said , " God , that was a beautifultoilet . I was going to have some more urinal candy shipped over . Some great flavor . " After that , we drank without speaking , until at last he burped and said , " It 's time to go home . " I looked at my watch . " I mean the States , " he said . " Stop in Paris first . " Peeris . " I do n't care if I ever go back , " I said . I realized that I meant it . I felt strangely solitary saying it . A moment later someone pinched me with a hard hand and put a friendly arm around me . It was an African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hey , man , " she said.  |p265On  a cold drizzly afternoon in July  --  Malawi 's independence day  --  I rode my bicycle into town . I could hear music coming from the stadium , and howling crowd-voices , and applause . But the celebrations had nothing to do with me . I was just a foreign teacher ; Mambo was headmaster . I hated seeing my students doing their Israeli marching , and I hated the Youth League in their red shirts . But most of all I sensed that this little phase was ending , and I was sorry , because I had liked living in a place that was neither a colony nor a republic . It had been nothing with a name , and very pleasant : it had resembled my own mood . In this special interval I had been able to pursue my secret life . The natural place for me that day was the Beautiful Bamboo . I realized then that a bar is a safe neutral place , where I had a right to be . And the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendlier . More than that  --  it was where I belonged . Looking around , I saw that at one time or another I had slept with every girl I could see . They were draped over the chairs and leaning on the bar and staring out the window at the rain . It was too wet and cold to go to the stadium , and anyway , the main independence celebrationwas in the capital . It was taking place at the moment . The radio was on . I could hear the band playing " Everything Belongs to Kamuzu Banda . " " This rain is very strong , " I said in Chinyanja . The word I used for rain , mpemera , was very precise . It meant the sweeping rain driven into the veranda by the wind . " Sure is , " a girl said , and another said , " Yah . " How long had they been replying this way ? The Beautiful Bamboo had never looked dingier . It was filled with hairy smells and the droning odor of wet shoes and muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake it stinkier , and the noise did n't help  --  the shouting African men , none I knew , and the radio competing with the jukebox , playing " Downtown " by a British singer . And over the radio came the sounds of the Malawi Policep266Band . Until today there had been no Malawi Police  --  who needed them ? But the band was playing so that students all over the country could do their Israeli marching . In the Zimba stadiumMr . Mambo was standing under his headmaster 's umbrella , taking credit for his goose-stepping students as he had for Rockwell 's chimbuzi . Rosie was heavily pregnant . She went back and forth with a tray . I bought a bottle of beer and sat alone , near the radio , to drink it . I bought another bottle . Twelve was my limit . I had a long way to go . The Chiffons were singing , " He 's So Fine . " " What these stupid colonialist people did not understand , " Doctor Banda shrieked , " was that we Malawians want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . They called me ! I heeded the call . Kwacha , they said  --  " His words were drowned by a group called The Shangri-Las singing " Leader of the Pack . " I could no longer hear the independencecelebration clearly on the radio , only its crackle . An orange light glowed in the large plastic dial . I could feel the warm radio tubes on my face . It was not like a radio at all but rather like a device for heating a room . Rosie came over with her tray . Her dress was tight against the ball of her big belly . I said , " Kwacha . " Dawn : it was the slogan . She said , " Hey , ya wan na beer ? " I said yes , and it frothed when she opened it . Was that squawk Doctor Banda 's nagging voice on the radio ? Americans said he was a charismatic leader . I never saw that . I suspected that he was insane . That freed me . What he said made no sense . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of the Bamboo , that I was certain the interval was over . It had been an instant , no more than a tick or two of time . How rare it had been , how unexpected . I had seen it all . I was where I wanted to be , and I 'd had everything I wished . I was still like a man on an island , among African girls . They were willing , unsuspicious , careless , and pretty . They did not attach the slightest importance to sex . It was too brief to be called pleasure , but it was fun . I felt very lucky . The drunker I became the luckier I felt . I was braced against the bar feeling nothing but gratitude ; and I was glad I wasp267twenty-three . I felt , living in the far-flung world , I had everything . One of my luckiest instincts lay in being able to tell when I was happy  --  at the time , not afterwards . Most people do n't realize until long afterwards that they have passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of reminiscence , and it is always tinged with regret that they had not known at the time how happy they were . But I knew , and my memory ( of bad times too ) was detailed and intense . So I made the most of those hours and days . I knew when a moment was rare . This was one , and there had been many in the months that preceded it . It warmed me like sunlight . But as I sat in the bar that day I felt the shadows lengthening , I sensed the light fading . I thought : It was bad before under the British , and it will bebad in the future with a greedy government ; but it 's perfect now . Jim Reeves was singing , " This World Is Not My Home . " Grace climbed onto the barstool next to me . " Give me one beer , father , " she said . The radio was still going , the dial was lit ; a howl of Kwacha ! came from the cloth on the loudspeaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beer . " Rubbish , " she said . " Where have you been keeping , Mister Handy ? " " Here and there . " There was too much to tell : my VD , the hospital work ; Gloria and her village ; changes at the school  --  Mambo , his Israelis , the latrine ceremony , all that . " But I 'm back now . " She was drinking  --  slurping . She scratched her dark forearm slowly , a sound like sandpaper . " You are still living on Kanjedza side ? " " Yes , sister . " I sipped my beer and became abstracted , thinking of a story about a waiting room . But in this waiting room no one is what he or she seems . The man with the little girl is not her father  --  he is a child molester . " You are still having that smart house ? " Grace said . " Sure . Come over and see it . " And I thought : The married couple are actually saying goodbye  --  she is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress . The cowboy is a homo . " First I want to dance here . "  | " We can dance , and then you can come over to my house , " I said . The little boy has a fatal disease , and one of them  --  probably the nun  --  has a hand grenade . But it was an impossible story to write  --  too static . No action . " We can go upstairs . " Grace laughed in her throat  --  a kind of gulping . " That 's a very pretty dress , " I said . " Seven pounds at the Indian shop , " she said . " And shoes . Three pounds . " That meant expensive , stylish , smart . She was boasting . " So what about it ? " I asked . She stared at me . I thought : A story about coincidences  --  enormous ones . A man goes out to buy some cigarettes for his wife and is hit by a car . At the same moment she electrocutes herself with her hair dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not knowing she is an orphan . No , forget it . " Let 's go , sister . " " Not just yet , " she said , and laughed again . Unwelcome laughter was so irritating . She kept it up . Could I ever get used to that laugh ? Another story . A divorce . It was the way she laughed , your honor . " First you give me money , " Grace said . This sobered me . I considered what she had said and found that I was very shocked . I thought of a story in which the most innocent and dependableperson one could think of demands suddenly : First you give me money . I said to Grace , " Maybe I 'll ask someone else  --  another girl , " and glanced around . " She will want money . " Why had I not guessed this would happen ? The radio was going , Banda at the stadium leading a hymn , " Bringing in the Sheaves . " Just about then  --  because the hymn continued in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head on my arms . " Sorry , " Grace said , waking me with her hard fingers stabbing me in my spine . Night had fallen while I slept . The Independence Celebrationswere over . African girls sat quietly at the tables in the Beautiful Bamboo . They watched the door , but no one entered.  |p269A  few of them muttered as I left with Grace  --  and I was limping , still waking up . We went back to my house in the darkness , saying nothing , listening to the trees drip as we walked . Captain had left a small tin oil-lamp burning in my room , and in this feeble light Grace undressed . She hung her blouse and skirt on the back of a chair ; she folded the rag she called her cardigan . She stood her shoes side by side against the wall . There were so many ways that a woman got into bed  --  all the postures that meant I 'm joining you , and the slow , reluctant movements a woman made when she was simply tired , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though she were alone . But I was still awake , and shortly I was on Grace . Her eyes were open , but her body seemed asleep . " Are you finished yet ? " she said . And then I could not continue . I rolled over and looked at the ceiling . Even in this cold season , Captain had draped the bed with a mosquito net . It looked mockingly like a bridal veil . " Do you want to stay ? " " It will cost more . " I was thinking about Africa . What an excellent place it was in the dark , and how lucky I was to be out of America and out of Vietnam . I could go on living , and from here in Central Africa I had a good vantage point on both those places ; I could begin to write something that was my own . I considered the word nocturnes . There was no writing here at all , and nocturnes was a word that had to be written  --  no one ever said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had tried to write a story about these African girls , but it kept coming out funny . I did not know that its comedy was its truth . I needed to write , because so much had happened to me to make me feel lonely , and writing about these past events was the best way of being free of their power . The thought stirred me and made me want to live a long time . That took seconds . Grace slammed the door hard and woke the dogs , and people started calling out , and cocks crowed , as light appeared in slashes between my curtains  --  another day . Though something had ended iii Africa I was still smiling . I wanted to go on rememberingthis.  |p273No  one looks more like a displaced person than an Indian in an overcoat . My friend , S. Prasad , the writer , was waiting for me behind the glass doors at Victoria Air Terminal . His winter clothes , and his thick meerschaum pipe , and the way he glowered  --  hiscomplexion was more gray than brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew better . He was an unusual alien : he knew everything about England , he had an Oxford degree , owned his own house , and had published half a shelf of books . He had won five literary prizes . " I do n't want to hear about prizes , " he sometimes said , making his famous face of disgust . He had lived here since he was eighteen . Still , he called himself an exile . He said he did n't belong  --  he looked it in his winter coat . Seeing me , he frowned with satisfaction . He told me about his being an exile as we crossed London in the back of a taxi on the way to his house . I was listening , but I was also rejoicing in the weather . In Uganda , where I now lived , the sun 's dazzle filled the sky , so most days there was no sky . After that dangerous and **26;16799;TOOLONG , England this wet day looked like a city underground . It was cold , it gleamed , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a holiday interval for me . I was tired of spending hot drunken Christmases in Africa . This time I would do it right  --  stay here , sing carols , tramp through the snowy streets ; then back to the jungle . " I have no home , " Prasad was saying , biting his pipestem . You Americans are so lucky  --  you can always go home . But howp274can I go back to that ridiculous little island ? Exile is a real word for me , you know . These chaps  --  " We were at a red light and men in bowler hats and black suits , like a crowd of morticians , were crossing the road in front of our taxi. "  --  these chaps have no idea . They have pensions and families and houses and , good God , they have children . They 're secure . They 're doing very nicely  --  probably putting a few pence away . What is that bespectacled son of a bitch looking at ? " It was a skinny-faced Indian in a pin-striped suit , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we drove off . " Pakistanis . They 're everywhere , " Prasad said . " Can you blame the English for complaining ? They 're no better than your bow-and-arrow men . " I said nothing , because I knew he was only half serious , and he was at his best when he was allowed to range freely . He was an intensely private and usually silent man , which was why when he stepped out and began to speak he could be startling . Also , he tested his opinions on perfect strangers . I hate music was one of the first things he ever said to me . He never repeated it , and so I assumed he probably did not mean it . Now he was talking about Pakistanis and Islam and Mr. Jinnah . I was transfixed by the people  --  the pretty girls in short skirts , the purposeful way they walked , the curve of their thighs , and all the hurrying people , so different from the shufflers in Wandegeya . Prasad saw that I was interested , but before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " And he smiled . " It might for you , Andre . " We crossed a bridge over the Thames and we seemed to be traveling outdoors for the length of it . I got a glimpse of the river and the pale winter light : white sky , black buildings . Then darkness again on the far side , and the taxi buried us in south London . " I should move from here , " Prasad said , as the taxi slowed on a narrow street of bulgey brown brick houses . " I 've put this little place on its feet . It 's time to go . " The house looked freshly painted  --  bright trim , a new gate , a garden in which the slender tires still flew tiny white tags from the nursery.  | " You ring the bell , " Prasad said , pocketing his latchkey . " Sarah likes a little drama . " His wife appeared a moment later , and threw her arms around me , and exclaimed , " Andy ! " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is **27;16827;TOOLONG , " Prasad was saying behind me . I could tell he was biting on his pipe . " Have n't I , darling ? Oh , do go in ! " I had been an admirer of Prasad 's writing for about four years when we met by chance in Africa . He said he was passing through ; he was restlessly working on a book that he carried from hotel to hotel . He read some things of mine and said , " Promise me one thing . That you will write about this place . " He meant Africa . I promised I would . And so we became friends . When he and Sarah left Africa he urged me to spend Christmas with them in London . Christmas was a long holiday in Uganda , where I was teaching  --  three weeks of rain and stiflingheat , and nothing to do but drink . And there was nothing to keep me there  --  I had no family . So I gladly went to London . I was grateful for Prasad 's invitation . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friendly way . " Sarah  --  it 's Andy 's first day in London ! " He laughed very hard and asked me how old I was  --  although he knew . And then he became grave and motioned with his pipe . " You saw Nyasaland and Tanganyika before you saw England , " he said . " You think it 's nothing , but that simple fact will probably affect you the whole of your writing life . " From the other room , Sarah said , " Nyasaland and Tanganyika have new names , you know . " " But who can pronounce them , darling ? " And he laughed . " They 're jolly hard  --  but I 'll bet Andy can ! " Then he took off his jacket and tie and put on his pajamas . He wore a purple bathrobe with velvet lapels and carpet slippers . It was eleven o'clock in the morning . He said he had work to do . He saw that I was puzzled . " I dress for dinner , " he said . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning when I came downstairs for breakfast I saw Prasad sorting Christmas cards . he took a letter from anotherp276pile and handed it to me . It had a bright Ghanaian stamp on it . Prasad said nothing , he was still sorting the Christmas cards ; but I knew he was watching me as I read it . I had been expecting this letter from Francesca . Over breakfast he said , " Sarah , Andy got a letter this morning  --  fromthe Gold Coast ! Imagine . " He turned to me . " Are you going to pay them a visit , the old Gold Coasters ? " " I was thinking about it . " " But European handwriting , " he said , and he squeezed his features in intense thought , and making this face he said , " French ? Italian ? It had a certain  --  " " Italian , " I said . He saw everything . " Ah , " he said . " I wish I had your energy , Andy . " He changed into a different pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing me on the way he said , " All this travel , all these tickets . I imagine you 're very well paid out there . The salaries are so grand . You probably have a pension plan . But what about your writing ? " " I 'm going to write some articles for a newspaper in Boston , " I said . " That 'll pay my way . " " That 's it , " Prasad said . He looked pleased at the news that I was paying my way . " You 're full of ideas , Andy . You have such a gift for these things . " " It means I 'll have to go back via Ghana . " " The Gold Coast , " Prasad said . " But you have a friend there . " He said friend as though he were saying woman : he knew . " And then maybe Nigeria . " " More bongo drums , " he said . " Then Uganda . " " The bow-and-arrow men . " To change the subject , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A story , " he said . " Want to hear the opening ? " This was unlike him  --  he never spoke about his work . I said I would be delighted to hear it .. He said , ' John Sniithers was buggering Simon Panga-Matoke when the telephone rang . Ile withdrew , and with tainted tumescent penis enteredp277his study . He picked up the receiver . It was the Director of the Ugandan Space Program . " Prasad stared at me . " You like it ? " I shook my head slowly , not wanting to speak . " I do n't know how you stand it , Andy , " he said . " Now remember your promise . " Sarah asked me to call him for lunch when I returned from a walk that morning . Prasad 's study was in total darkness , but when I opened the door I saw him lying on a sofa , still in his pajamas , smoking a cigarette . " I finished my book , " he said . " I have nothing to do . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird with a broken wing . " My problem was that I had no name for him . He was known as S. Prasad . His first name was Suraj  --  no one called him that . ( His hotel and restaurant reservations often appeared in the name " Sir Arch Prasad , " which pleased him . ) I was beyond calling him Mr. Prasad . Sarah called him " Raj . " It suited him , particularly when he was wearing his purple bathrobe and his Indian slippers . I did not know what anyone else called him . I had never met any of his friends . But that second day at lunch I said , " I 'd like to take you both out to lunch tomorrow . " " You go with Raj , " Sarah said . " I have work to do . " " What do you say , Raj ? " It was the first time I had used this intimate name . He smiled , and I felt we had advanced in our friendship , yetI was still conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful idea , " he said . " And I can drop off myproofs afterward . " He went to his study  --  to work , he said . But now I knew he was smoking in the darkness , lying on the sofa , like a man grieving . In the evening we watched television . I found the programs fascinating and intelligent , and I watched them hungrily , like a clog watching his meat being dumped into a bowl . Prasad hated them . " You think that man is smiling ? That man is not smiling . That is not a smile . That man is a politician . He is very crooked . " ' That was a documentary on the BBC . Then there was a discussion . The chairman made a joke and the studio audience laughed.  |p278Prasad  's lips were curled in disgust and pity . " Poor Malcolm , " he said . He turned to me . " Promise me you 'll never go on a program like that , Andy . " Sarah snickered as I solemnly promised never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Sarah was n't mocking me . She found Prasad endlessly amusing and unexpected . She was English , exactly his age , and such a good companion to this new friend of mine that I did not dare find her attractive . She stood at the door the next day as if seeing two boys off to school , or an outing  --  she fussed and hurried us and said , " Now remember not to leave your umbrella on the tube , Raj . " He did n't kiss her . Perhaps he saw that I noticed . " I hate displays of affection , " he said . On our way to the station he stopped at a newsagent 's bulletin board and peered closely at the various cards that were pinned to it . French Lessons . Theatrical Wardrobe . Very Strict Games Mistress Will Not Spare the Rod . For a Good Time Ring Doreen . Young Model Seeks Work . Dancing Lessons . Dusky Islander Seeks Driving Position . " This is a little lesson in English euphemism , " he said . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's anything here for you . " He did not move his head , and yet I knew he was watching me in the reflection from the glass . " No , I suppose not . " In the train he explained that the cards were put up by prostitutes . It was very straightforward . You called them and made an appointment . The price was agreed over the phone . And then you paid them a visit . Prasad saw that his explanation , even in his disgusted voice , had given me a thrill . " Sex is everywhere in this country , " he said . " It 's the new mood . It 's on everyone 's mind . It 's all people think about . It has become a kind of obsession . " He was biting his pipe . The passengers on the train were wearing heavy coats and scarves and hats , and their thick-soled shoes were scuffed and wet , and their faces were very white . Over their heads pink-faced women were shown in fancy underwearads , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . " Let them carry on , " Prasad said . " I do n't want to suppress it . I want everyone to be completely satisfied and then to stop . Let them get it over with . Let them burn . "  |p279He  looked around this Northern Line train and went on , " I want that urge to burn itself out . And then I want to hear no more about it . " We went to Wheeler 's Restaurant . We both ordered sole . " Shall we have a carafe of the house wine ? " Prasad said in a discouraged voice . " Oh , let 's have a classic wine . You have a job , you have a few pence  --  did n't you say you 're on expenses ? And this way we 'll remember it . People say , I drink plonk . ' But why ? Surely life 's too short for that . Let 's have a classic , one of the great wines , perhaps a white burgundy . " We had a bottle of Montrachet 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Prasad said , urging me to drink . " You 're going to remember that . " After lunch Prasad took me to his publisher , where he intended to drop off the corrected proofs of his book . I knew nothing about it other than it was his hotel novel , the one he had carried around East Africa , on his search for the perfect place to write it . Howletts Ltd. , Prasad 's publisher , occupied a small gray building of misshapen brickwork near the British Museum . The British Museum was to be our second stop  --  Prasad wanted to show me the manuscripts in the glass cases : " Johnny Keats , Jimmy Joyce , Sammy Johnson  --  even a bit of Shakey . They 've got them all . " But there was a problem with the proofs , or perhaps it was the foreign rights . Whatever  --  it meant that Prasad would be detained . " Oh , God , " he said , in real misery . " I 've let you down . And after that lovely lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but perhaps I could find my own way to the BM ? It was just over the road . He would see me later at home . " Do n't be depressed , " he said . " I 'm not depressed , " I said , though I felt a little drunk from the wine and might have been looking rather frog-eyed . " I 'll find the way . " " You 're so resourceful , " he said . He gave me his latchkey forthe front door , in case I happened to come home late . As I was leaving Ilowlett 's a blonde girl was also leaving , andI held the door open for her . She was very pretty , about my age ,  |p280and  was dressed like a Cossack in the fashion that was then in vogue  --  a fur hat , a long dark coat , and high boots . I sized her up quickly and then asked her directions to the British Museum . " I 'm going right past it , " she said . " Follow me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , too . She could so easily have given me directions . Her name was Rosamond . She worked at Howlett 's as an editor . But it was a small firm ; she also did typing , publicity , and ran errands . Hoping to impress her , I said that I had been to her officeswith one of Howlett 's writers , and I told her who it was . " Roger thinks he 's a genius , " Rosamond said , hinting in hertone that she did n't agree . " Who is Roger ? " " Roger Howlett . He 's sort of the owner . " She had long hair which she swung back and forth as she walked , and her stride was brisk and Cossack-like , her sleeves thrashing and her boots clumping . People stared at her and I drew closer to her side . " Everyone 's afraid of Prasad . He 's frightfully direct sometimes , and he has a beastly temper . " She smiled as though rememberingan incident . " What are you doing at the BM ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , but she tried to hide her reaction  --  probablyfor fear I 'd be offended . Then we were at the gates of the British Museum . " Want to have a drink sometime ? " She shrugged and said , " My friends and I usually go to that pub after work . " She pointed across the street . " Let 's meet there at six o'clock . " " All right , " she said . Inside I thought : If I had n't had that bottle of wine for lunch I would n't have spoken to her , and when I thought of Rosamond'sface I remembered Prasad saying Let 's have a classic . I might marry her , I thought  --  my whole life changed by a bottle of white burgundy . I was at the Museum Tavern when it opened at five-thirty , and so I saw her enter with her friends  --  a young woman named Philippa wearing a fur coat and a thin-faced , damp-haired young man named Ronnie.  |p281After  we had told each other our names , they asked me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my university job there , and S. Prasad . They seemed uninterested in what I said , and so I knew they were impressed : it was the English way  --  pride and shyness and obliquity . Most of my colleagues were English , after all . They supposed I was an American among Africans . Finally Philippa said that she would quite like to go to Africa . Rosamond said that Africa had never interested her but that she would do anything to go to Hong Kong . I thought that this was her English way of pinching me , but affectionately . Ronnie said , " You think Africa 's all elephants and lions and naked savages , but actually the animals are all in game parks and the Africans are hideously respectable . They 're always quoting the Bible , and they 're desperate for knighthoods . " He said this with great certainty , but it was similar to what Rosamond had said and for the same reason  --  he was trying to provoke me . When I smiled at him , he said , " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them on telly . And those cities are fantastically suburban . Andrew here probably lives in a very boring flat , or the sort of dreary maisonette you might find in a market town in the midlands . " I smiled again and said , " I guess I do . " " You see ! " Ronnie laughed hard and squeezed my leg , but the pressure lingered a fraction too long , and I knew he was a homosexual . He was the sort of boisterous , unhappy , abusive , **26;16856;TOOLONG who always went too far in order to be the center of attention . We had them in Uganda ; the Staff Club was full of them . " You 'll be here next month , wo n't you ? " I said no . " What a shame , " he said . " We 're going to have a huge demo in Grosvenor Square in front of the American Embassy . We 're planning to break things . " " I 'll be in Africa . " " I low dull , " Ronnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 's just like Surrey . " " On the other hand , hvenas get into my trash can about oncep282a week . I found a snake in my kitchen last year . And last month I found a bush-baby hanging on to my window . " " What 's a bush-baby ? " Rosamond said . All this time she had been listening very intently to Ronnie hectoring me . " It 's a ball of fur with big round eyes  --  a monkey , " I said . " I 've only seen them at night . It 's about the size of a big tomcat . The first thing you notice is its dark eyes , and once you see them you know it wo n't do you any harm  --  you want it to stay . I was just going to bed and I heard it scratching on the window bars . It was holding on with its little monkey-hands and sort of sitting on the sill as though it wanted to come in and get into bed with me . It was n't startled to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those lovely pleading eyes . " " That 's sweet , " Philippa said . Rosamond looked happy , and was about to speak when Ronniebegan to laugh in a mirthless and hostile way . " Do you know there 's no cure for rabies ? " he said . " If one of these sultry-eyed little creatures bites you , you froth at the mouth and die the most horrible and painful death through dehydration . " He smirked and went on , " It 's all in that boring book with the delightful pictures of fetuses that we published last month . God , is that the time ? Michael 's going to scream the house down . What a pleasure to me you are , Andre . Were you named after Andre Gide , by any chance ? I hope the answer 's yes ! " " Michael 's his boyfriend , " Rosamond said , after Ronnie had gone . " He took him to the Christmas party last week . No one was the least bit shocked . " Philippa said , " I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping to do . ' Bye , Ros . Lovely to meet you , Andrew . " All that time I had wanted to be alone with Rosamond , and now I was content . I hoped to sit there drinking with her for a few more hours , and to get drunk , and take her home and make love to her . I saw it as something like climbing four flights of stairs , and an event taking place on each landing , drinking on one landing , arriving at her place on the second landing , and the third and fourth a bit far off at the moment to be clearly described . But I felt we were already one flight up that long climb . We talked about African politics , and English weather , and American money . Meanwhile I was looking at her pale skin , andp283the way the heat of the pub had reddened her cheeks and dampenedher small ringlets of hair against her forehead and neck . She said there was a play she wanted to see sometime . I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " We should go out to eat  --  " I loved saying " we " and watching her eyes brighten . I had n't touched her . " Have another drink , " I said . She smiled and shook her head . " Do you know what I 'd really like ? " Then we were outside , swaying , hugging each other in order to stay upright . I thought : If I 'm this drunk so is she . Yellow light lay in spattered puddles on the black street , and pelting raindrops were dazzled by the headlights of oncoming cars . We walked through the rain and London seemed more than ever like a city underground . This wet sloppy weather looked dramatic to me . The rain and my drunkenness made me feel romantic and reckless . In the back of the taxi I took Rosamondin my arms and kissed her , and slid my hand under her huge coat , and groped for her . She did n't resist ; she squirmed and helped me a little  --  moved closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street she had made it clear with her hands and her tongue that I could make love to her . Nowhere I had ever been had seemed a better place for kissing a stranger than a London taxi . In the dark hours of the following morning she said , " Are you surprised I slept with you so quickly ? I 'm not usually such an easy lay . But when you told me that story about the bush-baby I trusted you somehow . I knew you would n't hurt me . And I knew you would n't turn me down . " Bless that bush-baby , I thought , and I remembered Africa . I told her I had to go but that I wanted to see her again  --  tomorrow . Today , she said , and kissed me . I put on my clothes and walked into the street . I was not afraid to be in this empty London street at four in the morning . I walked along and when a taxi approached I hailed it , and went back to Prasad 's across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers , sitting at his empty desk in his study , with an unlit pipe in his fingers . He said he had insomnia.  | " I 'm waiting for the birds to start chuntering , " he said . " Are you all right , Andy ? Of course you are ! " He sniffed and smiled  --  he 'd had a whiff of Rosamond . " You young chaps ! " I felt I had arrived in London at last . Within a week I began to have habits and haunts in this city : I invented routines and kept to them as a way of dealing with strange places and lengths of time . I slept late , and after lunch Prasad and I went for walks . We visited bookstores , we went to an uneventful seance at the BrixtonSpiritualist Church , we went to museums . He was my guide . He was a solitary man . He knew everyone , , but he had no close friends . His loneliness had made him intensely observant , as though this studious scrutiny were a remedy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paintings in the museums . He would lunge at the pictures , pointing out brushstrokes . " It 's a tiny smear . Now step back . It 's a person  --  is it a child ? Back farther . It 's a man . Look at the hat ! " I could only think how many afternoons he had spent looking at these pictures on his own and discovering these secrets . I liked him , I was grateful for his friendship , and I admired his writing ; but his isolation frightened me . I wanted my life to be different . He grew quieter as these afternoons wore on , and at the end of the day he always asked , " Are you meeting your friend ? " " Yes , " I said . " At that pub I told you about . Why do n't you come along ? " " I hate pubs , " he said , and he made his sour face . It was his look of disgust , as when he talked about sex , or meat , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet you , " I said , although that was not true . " I am quite happy , " he said . And lie looked happy : declining ,  |p285refusing  , withdrawing  --  such actions gave him pleasure . He sometimes smiled when he said no . " I do n't want to know any new people . " That was the way it went . I spent my days with Prasad and my nights with Rosamond , one life turning within the other , and both spinning within me . I always met Rosamond at the Museum Tavern and we always drank too much and always took a taxi back to her flat in Victoria . Before dawn I got up groggily and wandered the streets until I found a taxi to take me across the river . I never saw her building in daylight , and probably would not have recognized it if I had . We always spoke of going to movies or plays , but we never went . We made love recklessly , like strangers  --  mishearing every cry . Rosamond groaned and sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , startling me with certain words . This prim blonde English girl with her interesting job and her dainty way of drinking , would take off her pretty dress and pretend to be a whore . Plunging blindly on in the darkness of her room , I was almost convinced . She loved it when I told her she was hungrier than any whore that I had ever known . Afterwards , when we lay panting for breath , I thought of Prasad . " This sex thing is important to you , " he had said . " You young chaps . All that libido . " And once in a matter-of-fact voice he said , " I 've got a very low and unreliable charge . " It was a week before I realized that Rosamond had what she called flatmates  --  there were three other young women in this large apartment , and each had her own bedroom . One of them was Philippa . We returned one night to find Philippa in the kitchen with a young man . I felt we had interrupted them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ypu to meet my fiance . " The formal word surprised me and made me feel faintly indecent . His name was Jeremy . He was in advertising . He said , " You americans have some super ideas , " and seemed very nice anda bit shy . Philippa said , " Ilowlett 's could do with some good advertisingideas . Roger drinks book promotion is vulgar . " " Michael says he 'll never be a really first-rate publisher because he 's too much of a gentleman . " This conversation continued lot a dhile.:urcl I listened andp286said nothing . But I was thinking : They are living in the world , generating ideas , publishing books , making money , thinking up advertising slogans , working from day to day and solving problems . Nothing they did or said had anything to do with me . I pretended I had a job , I said I was a writer ; but really I was simply living in Africa , waiting for something to happen to rite . Rosamond said , " Andy lives in Africa . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had run away , but I had run so far it was interesting . Jeremy said , " There 's an enormous future for tourism there . Especially in Kenya . " Was there ? I lived not far away and I did not know that . Rosamond said , " Andy 's a writer . " Hearing her say that made me think that she was proud of me , and I felt a pang of love for her . " We were just making cocoa , " Philippa said . " Would you like some ? We 've made masses  --  I used all the milk , I 'm afraid . " Rosamond and I were pleasantly drunk and wanted the feelingto last . We said no to the cocoa , and locked ourselves in her bedroom . We undressed each other impatiently . " The better you know someone the less you 're interested in their clothes , " I said , and unhooked her black bra . " You 're drunk , " Rosamond said , in a drunken way , and pulled me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs around me . " They 're going to get married after Christmas , " she said after we made love . We were stuck together , still on the floor . " In a beautiful little church in the Cotswolds . They never go out . They 're saving all their money for a deposit on a flat . " It seemed such a pleasure to be married . I thought of Prasad and his wife in their house in south London . Sarah fussed over him and poked fun at him . But she also helped him . She read his proofs , she cooked , she ran the house . They seemed very close , as though they had formed their own intimate little society . That was the reason he seldom went out , and it was why they did not mind my staying away these nights with Rosamond : Raj and Sarah had a private life to which I could not be admitted . It seemed to me that nothing was more exclusive or unknowable than a happy marriage . It was the rarest friendship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to be married , " I said.  |p287Rosamond  said nothing and then she giggled in the darkness and said , " What are you saying to me ? " " Would you like to get married ? " " I do n't know , " she said . She tossed her hair . " I 've never given it any thought . " But when we made love again shortly afterwards she whimperedand began to cry . Her face was wet with tears . She said , " I 'm happy , " and held me close to her . She hugged me . She said , " I wo n't let you go . I 'm going to keep you prisoner . " When I struggled to get free , she laughed , and became aroused once more . I was haggard when I arrived back at Prasad 's that early morning : I clucked , seeing my face in the hall mirror . Prasad opened his study door and said , " I think you like this girl . " He was in his pajamas . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , and heard her saying through clenched teeth Bite me  --  I 'm a whore . I had to repeat to myself , Yes , she is very nice . " Where do her people live ? " " Her , um , people live in a place called Walton . " " Oh , God , " Prasad said . He made his disgusted face , but it was worse than usual . " Walton-on-Thames . " " You know the place ? " " My heart sinks at the thought of places like that . " I knew where she lived , because that very morning , before I left her apartment , she asked whether I would go home with her for Christmas dinner . I had asked her where . " It 's one of these nightmare places , " Prasad said . " England 's full of them . " " He 's just being silly , " Sarah said , later that day . " It 's lovely . It 's on the river . You 'll have a wonderful time . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will celebrate in our usual style , " Prasad said . " Very quietly , I 'm afraid . My bingeing days are over . " Then he laughed , and so did Sarah . I envied them the way they had each other . Christmas morning was dt'v and bright , the blue sky mirrored on the upper windows of old buildings , and the city was very still ,  |p288as  on the day after a great event . There were few people about , no buses , hardly any traffic , and every shop was shut . Near the station , which was closed , there were pools of vomit on the curb , still fresh , like messes of spilled soup . A peaceful silence lay over the city , and the occasional burst of church bells made this silence more emphatic . This sunlight and emptiness was perfect for our meeting : Rosamond was waiting in her long cossack coat and fur hat on the steps of Waterloo Station . It was as though we were the only people awake this morning  --  we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel innocently happy , and I kissed Rosamond with such energy and hope that she shrieked . And I gave her a present , a silk scarf from Liberty 's with the date of the New Year on it , 1968 . " I 'm going to wear it , " she said , and tied it loosely around her neck . " It 's beautiful . " I saw her glance at herself as we passed a shop window in the station . She looked pleased as she turned away . After we boarded the train , she gave me a present  --  a leather wallet . I said it was just what I needed , and I showed her my old one to prove it . Then we sat holding hands , saying nothing , traveling in the empty rattling train that smelled of stale smoke and the mingled odors of last night 's homeward-bound partygoers  --  perfume , cigarettes , beer , whiskey , fried food . There were shreds of gift wrapping and twisted ribbon among the trampled newspapers . I began to feel sad when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts that people exchanged when they did not know each other well . Sitting there silently  --  but wanting to speak  --  I felt Rosamond was a stranger , and I was apprehensive about meeting her family . It was not a long trip  --  much less than the hour she said it would take . England seemed such a small place , in spite of many names . It was all names , and they were impressive , but they were signs on stations , no more than that ; a brief stop , no one got on or off , we moved on . The distances were slight and the places disappointing . In Africa for hundreds of miles there were hills and valleys and forests , and nothing had a name . Walton was just small houses and roofs . Where was the river ? I felt cheated by these London names . There was no green at Bethnal Green  --  only a street and traffic and Shepherd 's Bushp289was a dangerous intersection . The slum at Elephant and Castle was the worst cheat of all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said nothing more . He did not shake my hand . He did not tell me that his name was James Graves  --  I had to ask Rosamond that . I had been feeling cheery , but this English obliqueness sobered me by making me attentive . We got into his small car and drove , but not far , to a house I first took to be large until I realized that it was half the building , semidetached , though it too had a name , Rosedene . It was two textures , stucco and brick , with a tile roof , and it lay behind thick hedges . In its small and fussy front yard there were four dusty rosebushes and a birdbath and rectangular patches of grass that looked like upturned scrubbing brushes . Everything was a tight fit  --  the railway line , the station , the street , Mr. Graves 's car , this house , and even the guests , seated close together in the parlor drinking Christmas sherry . The sun streamed through the windowsand warmed the Christmas tree and released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and heavy shoes , and his wife an apron  --  she was just doing the roast potatoes , she said . There was Rosamond 's younger sister , who was also pretty ; her name was Janey and she had a ringing laugh that made Mr. Fry , who sat next to her , squint in an exaggerated way . Dave and Jill shared a big chair  --  she sat on the arm . Dave was a red-faced man in a yellowish suit , and Jill a plump woman who , under the pretense of restraining her husband , actually encouraged him . " So this is the Yank we 've been hearing about , " Dave said . " Do n't be beastly , " Jill said , and laughed as she pushed his head . This made Dave smile . " They say everything in America is bigger than over here . Cheers , James "  --  Mr. Graves had refilled the tiny glass of sherry  --  " Happy Christmas . God bless . " He took a sip . " That right ? " His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to answer him ? " Oh , Dave , do n't start , " Jill said , and laughed affectionately . Mr. Fry said , " I 've got a cousin who went out there . Canada . Toronto , I think . They usually send a Christmas card . " " A big Christmas cant , " Dave said . " Bigger than ours . "  | " I do n't come from Canada . " Rosamond said , " Andrew 's from Boston . " " They 're more English than the English , " Mr. Graves said . Now they were all staring at me , waiting for me to speak again . " How are you getting on here ? " Mr. Fry asked . Before I could answer , Rosamond 's mother spoke up . She was twisting her apron in her hands . " People criticize us , but this is eversuch a small place , and we 're not as wealthy as we used to be . " I did not know whether this woman was talking about herself or England , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron . " Oh , do leave Andrew alone , " Rosamond said . " You 're just putting him off . " I loved the way she chewed the word orf . " If I do n't see to the roast potatoes , " her mother said , and she left the hot room without finishing her sentence . " Because of the blacks , " Dave said with force in his voice , his cheeks tightening . " That 's why they criticize us . Your friend knows a bit about that , I reckon , Ros . " He created a silence in the room with his confidence . He said again , " Blacks . " I could not hear the word without seeing dark dumb blunt things , like stumps in a burned forest . Mr. Graves cleared his throat and began to speak . I was relieved to think that he would lighten the atmosphere . He smiled , but I realized that his smile was only to give an edge to his sarcasm when he said , " But do we get a word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , my heart goes out to those Rhodesians . " " Andrew works in Uganda , " Rosamond said , as a sort of protest . " He would , would n't he ? " Dave said , which made Jill laugh . Janey was looking at me eagerly and smiling , the fascinated younger sister , with her lovely eyes and her large young lips . Mr. Graves said , " That 's just what I mean , Ros . Now the Americans are going to Africa and saying what a bad job we did of it . Well "  --  and he glanced at me  --  " see how they like it . " " I 'm sorry to have to say this , " Mr. Fry said , not sounding sorry at all , " but the Americans are welcome to them . They can have every damn one of them . " " And not only in Africa , " Dave said . ' There 's a few round our way I 'd like to send over . "  | " My mother used to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never take their hats off when they go inside , " Mr. Fry said . " She often went to the pictures , my mum . " And he smiled . The conversation turned and turned , like a merry-go-round that I was trying to get on , but each time I made an attempt it speeded up . I saw that I would fall if I just leaped aboard , and so I did nothing and felt foolish . Dave was telling a confused story . It took awhile for me to realize that it was a joke , about a black man at a bus stop who was asked how long he had been here . He said , " Five years . " The Englishman replied , " That 's a long time to wait , even for a Number Eleven bus . " Dave compounded the malice of the joke by swearing it was true . Mr. Graves said , " Drink up , everyone . I can hear Dickie calling us . " Rosamond 's mother was called Dickie ? " That 's the spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't take this mob seriously . " I nodded and smiled again realizing that the name Dickie had made me smile , and then I wondered whether Mr. Fry was being sarcastic . " I 've always wanted to visit America , " Jill said , as we filed into the dining room . " See the Statue of Liberty . See Niagara Falls . Do they really have cowboys out there ? " " That 's the question my African students always ask , " I said . She did not hear me . She was handing me a Christmas cracker and yanking at the same time . There were a series of pops and shouts . Then the reading of the mottoes , and everyone put on a paper hat . " Poor Andy , " Rosamond said . " I 'll pull your cracker . " " I 'll bet you will , " Dave said , and Jill shrieked . And then I put on my paper dunce cap . We sat close together around a small sunlit table of steaming vegetables . Mr. Graves straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are our own people , " he said . Mr. Fry was next to me , not eating but mashing food onto the tines of his fork and making a lump of it like an African daubing a wall . On my other side , Rosamond sulked in embarrassed silence , hearing her father use the expression " our kith and kin in Rhodesia . " Her mother  --  what was your name if people calledp292you Dickie ?  --  looked tired and tearful . Perhaps she was drunk . She said we must n't miss the Queen 's Christmas message on television . " That went down very well , " Mr. Fry said , arranging his knife and fork parallel on his empty plate . " Talkative , is n't he ? " Dave said to Rosamond , and when I looked up I saw everyone staring at me again and laughing loudly  --  much too loudly , when I said nothing . The Christmas pudding was doused with brandy and lighted . A blue flame flickered around it for a few seconds . I was given a crumbling wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , but when I bit down I cracked a tooth and began to choke . Then I took a small smeared coin out of my mouth . " Andrew 's got the sixpence , " Rosamond 's mother said . " That 's lucky , " Mr. Fry said . " I guess I 'll need it to pay my dentist , " I said . No one laughed . We went into the parlor again to have coffee and to watch the Queen on television . The Queen looked very white and nervous , and she was sitting in a room just like this parlor , rather clutteredand fussily arranged , with framed family pictures , doilies , porcelain knickknacks , footstools , and frilly lampshades . Mr. Graves awkwardly proposed a toast and then everyone except Dave and Jill went for a walk to the river , which was as still as a pond and black , with black leafless trees on both banks . Before we had finished our walk , a wreath of fog gathered on the water , and then night fell  --  the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tea ? " Rosamond 's mother asked her , although I was standing next to her . I hated the way the question was put , and so I pretended to be deaf . Rosamond made an excuse and said we 'd have to go back to London right away . On the train she said , " I 'm really sorry , " and nothing more . Now I was grateful for her silence . She took my hand . I felt miserable . There seemed something final in the pressure of her hand on mine . " I was expecting you somewhat later than this , " Prasad said , when I returned to his house , and then he looked closely at me . " Oh , God , what happened ? "  |p293I  told him of my Christmas visit . " Pay no attention to them , " he said . " They 're inferior people . Did they have one of these depressing houses , and a monkey wagon in the driveway ? You should have nothing to do with them . Just walk away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These peopleare only dangerous to themselves . " He was making stabbing gestures with his pipestem . He wore his pajamas , his bathrobe , his slippers  --  and the socks I had given him for Christmas . " And the girl  --  you must leave her , Andy , " he said . " Forget her . Forget the family . They 're nightmare people . The house . The opinions . Do you want that ? Do you want that nonsense and a little monkey wagon ? " " I do n't know what to do , " I finally said . Sarah was looking sadly at me and thinking Poor Andy . " Just "  --  and then Prasad raised his hands , like a priest at theconsecration , giving his words weight  --  " leave her . " " I do n't want to hurt her . " She 'll be very relieved . " After Sarah had gone to bed , Prasad took me into his study and opened a filing cabinet . He showed me some of his notebooks , his novels written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisiveness , and so I was surprised  --  even shocked  --  to see his handwriting , the hesitations , the blotches and balloons and crossings out . Whole pages were disfigured , and many were recopied three or four times . And then I realized I hardly knew him . " You want to be a writer , Andy . But you see ? " He opened another notebook  --  words blacked out , scribbles , his fine handwritingdeteriorating into a scrawl . " It 's terrible , man . But if you 're serious you have a lot of work ahead of you . " He was gone when I woke up the next day . Sarah said he was lunching in Kensington . I watched for him , and I was standing at the window when his taxi drew up . There was someone else inside . " Cyril Connolly , " he said . " We shared a taxi . You know him ? " " The Unquiet Grave is a masterpiece , " I said . Prasad winced , as he always did when he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window . He asked who you were . " " What did von tall hint ? "  | " That 's Andre Parent . An American writer , ' Prasad said . " He 's going to the Gold Coast . ' " " What did he say ? " " That he knew your work , " Prasad said , a smile rising on his lips . " What work ? " " Exactly . You have n't a moment to lose . " The main street of Accra was scattered with squashed branches and trash , and some of its potholes were large enough to hold three children , just their dark heads showing above the street as they played in the yellow mud of the hole . I felt sick to my stomach , queasy in this humidity and heat after the cold air of London . Africa now seemed to represent ill-health and failure . Francesca was driving . She steered around a pothole that would almost have swallowed her little Fiat . " They always say they are going to fix them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She drove badly , making me sicker . We were shopping . We tried to buy beer for New Year 's Eve  --  tomorrow . There was none to be had in the entire city . But why were we buying it today ? Why had n't she thought of this before ? She had known a month ago that I was coming . " They are always out of it ! You ca n't buy coffee ! You ca n't buy lipstick ! Did you get the makeup I asked you to buy at Boots ? " " It 's in my bag . " " And they always smile stupidly and say Do n't worry . ' " The cynic habitually says always and never , but after only three months in the country had she any right to be cynical ? Francesca was tough . That was surprising first of all because she was tiny and looked helpless . But she was solitary and sell reliant , and she had the melancholy of the Italian woman whop295faced life alone  --  no husband , no children , no church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her independence and her anger she seemed to me extraordinary . But I was uncomfortable with her  --  because she was older than me , she would n't say how much older ; and because her melancholy could turn from thoughtful pessimism to bleak sadness . I knew when : sadness gave her bad posture . She had gone first to London , where she had learned English , and then she visited Boston , where we had bumped into each other on a bus to Amherst . We had exhausted each other one weekend , making love , and then she was gone . We stayed in touch by letter . She was in Paris , then back in Sicily , among people she hated . My being in Africa gave her an idea . After a while she turned up in Ghana , teaching at the university , English , of all things . But it was not very demanding work . It was a place much like my own  --  middle-aged students doing high school work . " These are the laziest students I have ever taught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget to read the book ! ' " When a person with an accent imitates the accent of another person , the satire usually collapses into self-parody . And I had found that most people who tried to imitate the way Africans talked were racists . It took me a little while to realize that when Francesca criticized Ghana or the Africans she did not regard it as racism . She felt it was the opposite  --  proof that she was truly broadminded . Perhaps she was . She certainly seemed confident . It took confidence to laugh and mimic and lose your temper in Africa , but it was tiring for me to watch and listen . " Africans are really hopeless , " she said . " I need to meet some Ghanaians , " I said . " That 's why I came here . " " I thought you came to see me . " " Right . But I have to pay my way . I 'm writing an article . " " What is it about ? " " Ghana after Nkrumah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , so I continued , " What now ?  --  Who 's in charge ?  --  What next ?  --  Are we at a crossroads ? On the one hand this , on the other hand that . It 's a thumbsucker . " She laughed  --  she liked hearing new expressions in English . And laughter turned her into a new person  --  she made a loudp296approving noise and her small body became supple . She had short black hair and golden skin . She loved the color green  --  dresses , scarves , even underwear  --  and because she was short she always wore interesting shoes  --  high heels and basketwork things with built-up soles . " I can introduce you to some Africans , " she said , and drove on . She lived in a hot little apartment in a building that was faced with plaster that had turned from yellow to gray in the damp heat . So many of the buildings in Accra looked brittle and moldy , like stale bread , and the streets too were crumbled like old cake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even at night the air was clammy and unbreathable . That first night , when we could n't buy any beer , we sat surrounded by packing crates and tea chests  --  she said that she had n't had time to unpack properly and anyway found them convenient for storing her things . They were like cupboards , she said . They gave the room the cluttered and stacked-up look of an attic or a storeroom . Her ceiling fan was no more than a whirring distraction . It made the calendar rattle against the wall , but it did not cool me . Francesca wore a Ghanaian cloth wraparound , which slipped loose as she leaned over and spooned some sinister-looking stew into my plate . I looked down and saw lurid vegetables in greasy gravy . There was bread but it was hard and dusty , and the butter tasted of soap . " This food is disgusting , " Francesca said . " My cook is good for nothing . " I said nothing . It was obvious the food was bad . In any case I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sickness . When I said I was n't hungry , Francesca squawked for the cook . He entered in a stiff and almost ceremonial way to remove the plates . Francesca plopped her spoon into her plate , as the cook made a little bow . " You want pooding , muddum ? " " No , no , no , no , no . " And she waved him away . Silently the table was cleared , and I saw that it was not a table , but another packing crate . " Why do n't you cook , if he 's so bad ? "  | " I hate cooking , " she said . Then it was clear to me why she treated him so rudely . It was one bad cook blaming another . " I just like eating , " she said . The cook was padding back and forth , one room away . We sat restlessly , and her sentence still hung in the air . The ceiling fan went ark-ark . Someone else 's radio penetrated our wall , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choking dogs . The kitchen door clattered : the cook was gone . " I 'm still hungry , " Francesca said . " I 'm not surprised . " But she was smiling . " Now I 'm going to eat you . " She switched the light off , but the yellow light from the street brightened the room and gave the packing cases crooked shadows . Francesca was standing before me . " I like these Ghanaian dresses , " she said . " So easy to take off . " She unknotted it and it slipped to the floor . She was naked . Her body was lighted by the streetlamps and stripes lay across her curves like contours  --  the shadows of the window bars showingon her skin . She dropped to her knees . I looked up at the ceiling . Ark-ark  --  the fan had a froggy voice ; and later with the bed creaking it was like a jungle racket . I woke up the next morning feeling ill . The humid heat was a weight that squeezed my eyes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocation , and I sweated as though running a temperature . Francesca said it was a normal day in Accra . A normal day was like a fever . I foresaw a week of this fever and this food . " Why do n't we take a trip ? " I said . " We could drive somewhereup-country in your car . " I had a feeling that if we went north it would be cooler , and I hated this broken-down city . Francesca was frowning  --  her way of showing me she was thinking . " We do n't have any plans for New Year 's . There 's hardly any food in the cupboard . And there 's nothing to drink . " " You are criticizing me , " she said peevishly.  |p298I  denied it and said I was sorry , but so feebly she knew I was lying . " And it might be fun to take a trip . " Now I regretted leaving London so suddenly , and I missed Prasad and Rosamond and the black gleaming streets . " We could go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel where no one ever stays . It 's very green in Kumasi and a bit cooler . But what about those Africans you wanted to meet ? " " Where are they ? " " One lives in the next block of flats , " Francesca said . " He works for the government . He might have some stories for you . His name is Kofi . Everyone is named Kofi or Kwame . We can see him before we go . " I was so eager to leave I immediately packed my bag , and began hurrying Francesca . But this made her dawdle all the more . At last she said there was n't time to see Kofi , and he was so boring what was the point ? " I have to see him , " I said . He was a man in his late twenties , with the sort of protruding teeth that gave him an amiable expression . He laughed each time he spoke , and everything he said was a compliment . " You are so young . You are so handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined an old man . But not a smartly dressed young lad  --  " Was this what Francesca meant by boring ? I found it worse than that . I wanted to tell him to shut up . I said , " What ministry are you with ? " " Ministry of Works . " He smiled . " It is all bribery and corruption . That is the African way . It is hopeless . " " The roads are in rough shape in Accra . " He laughed very hard in a mirthless way . " In Accra they are good ! You should see the rest of the country ! " His laugh went ark-ark-ark like Francesca 's fan . " The ministersteals money and gives it to his wives . He has four wives . He has a house in London . He is a devil . " He laughed again . " You do n't sound angry . " " Why be angry ? Life is short . We say Be happy  --  do n't worry . ' You are in Africa , my young friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve . " He took a bottle of beer lions a crate on tlhe floor and openedp299it . He splashed some beer on the threshold . " That is a libation , " he said . " For the gods . " " Which gods ? " " All of them . " ' He filled three glasses . All this time Francesca was sighing  --  a sort of audible boredom . We drank a little and Kofi emptied the last of the bottle of beer into my glass . It was very bad for the host to drink the last of the beer , he said . " I thought they were out of beer in Accra . How did you get it ? " " Bribery and corruption , " he said . Ark-ark . " I will get you some crates . As many as you want . Leave it to me , my friend . " There was a murmur in the next room . Kofi yapped in his own language , a sort of crow-squawk , and a woman appeared . She was about fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pregnant and perspiring . " This is my lady wife , Mr. Endro , " Kofi said . " She does n't speak English . Just a simple village girl . " She was barefoot , and breathless from the heat . She dabbed her face . " When is the baby due ? " " One month or so , " Kofi said . " It will be our first child . You can be godparents . Or uncle and auntie . " Francesca sighed again , but Kofi did not seem to mind . He was flattering , obtuse , full of promises and compliments . He never sat down . He walked up and down , laughing in his croaky way , urging us to drink more . He was much cheerier than the rather solemn-looking Ugandans I was used to . But he was repetitious , and I wondered whether he were drunk . He was scathing about the Ghana government . " They are like vultures , " he said . " There will be another coup , oh sure , " and he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coun-try " I 'd like to meet someone in the government , " I said . " Sure . The minister ? The perm sec ? The deputy minister ? I can arrange it for you . Have another cup of beer , please . " Everything seemed so easy . An hour with a politician or civil servant was just what I needed . I could see someone at the American Embassy ( " A western diplomatic source told me " ) ,  |p300and  talk to people at the market in Accra , or other friends of Francesca 's ; and I would have my article about Ghana , which would be my air fare for this month of travel . " Any of them , " I said . " All of them . I just want to ask a few questions . Listen , are you sure you can fix it up ? " " Leave it to me . I can fix it up . " He seemed to be trying out my words , making them his own . " When you come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " He uttered two crow-squawks at his wife , who stopped dabbingat her perspiring face and tramped heavily out of the room . She returned with two bottles of beer . " I 've had enough , " I said , and snatched my glass off the table . " This is a present , " he said . " You take them with you . Happy New Year . African custom . " " We do n't want it , " Francesca said , bluntly , snapping her jaws at him . " But the young man wants the beer , " Kofi said , winking at me . Francesca was annoyed , and it showed . But Kofi seemed not to notice , or perhaps he did n't care . " You are welcome here , " Kofi said . " We respect teachers in Ghana . They are like gods to us . We are thirsty for education . " On the road to Kumasi , I said , " You were n't very polite to him . " " Kofi ? He is like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself . " " If he gets me an interview with the minister I 'll forgive him for anything . " After a long silence Francesca said , " Sometimes you say such stupid things . " I was driving the Fiat now . The little car strained on the rising roads  --  but the road was better than I had expected . Contrary to what Kofi had said , as soon as we left Accra the road had improved . We entered a higher and more wooded region . But the foliage was messy and cluttered , a disorderly forest of brokenand hanging trees and dense bamboo . The birds were frenzied , and every hundred yards or so there was a dead dog in the road , some of them plump and bleeding , but most of them old and as stiff as mats . The roadside huts matched the trees and had similarly shaggy roofs . What houses I could sec  --  the more solid buildings  --  were stained and cracked.  |p301I  compared what I saw here with what I knew in Uganda and Malawi . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forests more orderly , the roads in better repair . I could put that in the article . I was so intent on thinking of the article and driving the car that I did not speak for a long time , and then I started talking , and as I did  --  asking questions and answering them myself  --  I realized that Francesca had not said a word for half an hour . Her face was averted . " Are you sulking ? " " No , " she said . " But I wish I had n't taken you to see Kofi . " " Why ? Because he ignored you ? " " He did n't ignore me , " she said quickly . " But did you see how he treated his wife ? " She mimicked someone spitting . " They 're all like that . " I drove on . Ramshackle forest . Goats . Men on bikes . Mammy wagons . She said , " I did n't realize until I saw you two together how much I disliked him . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to tease her . " I do like you , Andre . You know that . Sometimes I think the feeling is stronger than liking you . " She frowned and turned away . I put my hand on her knee . " You know I love you . " " Do n't joke about it , " she said . " It 's bad for me to like you so much . " She faced me and said crossly , " I want more than this ! " " So do I. " I meant it , and I said it with such force that she turned to me again and touched my face tenderly and let me kiss her hand . She snuggled closer and let my fingers drift between her thighs . " This is the bush . " " I like the bush , " I said . The shaggy roadside woods were a preparation for shaggy Kumasi . It was a green town with sloping streets and small shops and municipal buildings plastered with red dust . Its trees were shapeless , like gigantic weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tall feathers . We arrived as it was growing dark , and found the Royal Hotel where we registered as man andp302wife . There was no beer available at the hotel , so we drank the bottles that Kofi had given us . The hotel smelled of dampness and dead insects . The wood squares of the parquet floors had worked loose . We ate mutton and boiled vegetables in the empty dining room . The waiter said in a reproachful way , " It is New Year 's Eve . The people are all at the parties in the bars and nightclubs . " We heard the shouts and the music from down the street . " What shall we do ? " Francesca said , " Come upstairs and I 'll show you . " I had never known . her so amorous . We did not leave the bedroom until after midnight . Drunken men were staggering and singing in the street . We went back to the room and made love again , and then slept until noon . That day we drove to the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palace . " We went to the museum . It was shut . So was the market . Without people , the streets and shops looked dirty and ugly . In bed that night Francesca said , " I thought Africa would be darker . More dangerous and mysterious . Sometimes I want to leave just go away before I start to hate them . " She held me tightly . I wondered what it would be like to travel with her . When she was amorous she was like a child . I liked that  --  having a lover , a daughter , a wife : one woman . And I liked the thought that she was strong , that I could depend on her . " Happy New Year , " I said . That I was with her on this day  --  surely that was significant ? " We 'll have to get used to saying nineteen sixty-eight . " Francesca hugged me and said , " I 'm happy , Andre . " It was just dawn the next morning when I sat up , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar itch  --  a thread of irritation  --  insidemy penis . I squeezed it , holding it like a toothpaste tube , and a gob of thick yellowish fluid collected on its tip . I rolled over and cursed . Francesca threw her arm around me . " Do n't , " I said , and shrugged . " I have some kind of infec-tion . " We found a Ghanaian doctor in Kumasi . He sat me down and put on plastic gloves and examined me . He asked me some simple questions.  | " It is gonorrhea , " he said . " Do n't worry "  --  he was writing a prescription  --  " this will clear it up . Are you married ? " " No , " I said . Francesca had waited in the car . I got in and said , " He says I 've got VD . " She crossed her legs , but said nothing . " I know where I got it , " I said , trying to control my voice . " What I want to know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . And then I knew , and I saw him clearly ; his buck teeth , his bulging eyes . I remembered all his promises , and how she had said nothing . I put the car into gear  --  it was such a little car . We tottered towards the coast . " Where are we going ? " she asked . " Nowhere , " I said . " You must drink , " the African man next to me said . We were on the flight from Accra to Lagos . Bottles of beer were being handed out to the passengers . " You must have one or two . " The doctor in Kumasi had told me not to  --  alcohol reduced the effectiveness of the penicillin . " I ca n't , " I said . I still itched . " Ca n't drink ? " He grinned at me in contempt , showing all his front teeth . " I 'm an alcoholic , " I said . " If I have one drink I 'll want to have another . And then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! Yes ! " he said eagerly , laughing hard , and pushing a bottle at inc . " Go on ! " " And then I 'll vomit , " I said . He was wearing a new suit . His hand went to his lapels , whichp304he smoothed , as he laughed again , but in a discouraged way . " I understand , " he said . He was an economist . Feeling I had nothing to write about Ghana , I pressed him for his views on Nigeria  --  he was a lecturer at the University of Ibadan . He was very precise in his figures , and mocking in his manner . When he told me how Nigeria financed its industrial projects he spoke in a voice that was both gloating and complaining . " You want to know the terms of reference of this little exercise ? " he said . He drank and wiped his mouth . " The company pays over the odds in order to establish itself . The minister concerned takes a twenty-percent cut  --  and he sends this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive license , so it pushes its prices up . When the minister sees the profits he demands his share . That 's how it goes on . The companies and the politicians are conspiring against the people . " He smiled at this . " Neocolonialism is not just an empty term . It has an actual meaning . No matter how much money this country makes it will always be poor . Nothing will change . In financial terms we were better off under the British . " " But in political terms Nigeria is freer , is n't it ? " He laughed at this . " We have had two military coups ! " " I thought Nigeria was more unified now . " " There is going to be a war here , " he said , dropping his voice . " In the east  --  Ibo land . Do n't go there . It 's not political , and it 's not about money . The Ibos are fighting for the most important thing  --  their lives . " " How do you know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And what do you do ? " " I 'm a teacher , " I said . " In Uganda . " " Are you on holiday ? " It was always foolish to mention writing or journalism inAfrica , so I said , " Sort of . I 'm also seeing a friend . " " I thought all the foreigners left after the last coup . " " My friend is a Nigerian , " I said . " God help you ! " he said , and he laughed so loudly that severalpeople turned to stare at him . And then the plane was descending , streaking past mud hutsand junked cars and the scrappy rooftops of ' small shacks . The economist hurried out of the plane . I thought : lle ' . c notreal . The next day , talking to other Nigerians  --  editors , a rc  --  - p305porter , a publisher 's representative  --  and a U.S. Embassy official , I had the same thought , that they were not real either . They were acting . Their actual lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cast themselves in the colorful role of writers or businessmen or teachers or tribesmen . In each public person was a smaller stranger person who bore no resemblance at all to the one I saw , and I was always on the point of demanding Who are you ? or Who do you think you are ? when I remembered , with a little shock , who I was . I had not seen Femi for a year . I had never thought I would see her again . I did not want to startle her and so , instead of calling her , I called her brother George . This was after I saw the editors and officials , for the sake of my article . George appeared at my hotel . He was so black and smooth he seemed to be wearing a second skin : he was like someone else within that slippery skin  --  but who ? " Come , we will have a drink ! " He was hearty , expansive , energetic . He would not look me in the eye . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strangeness of Lagos . From a fine , expensive hotel it was a short walk to a dangerous slum . There were prostitutes in the club  --  tall skinny girls in tight skirts , wearing orange and blonde wigs . George shouted for two beers , and when they were brought and we touched glasses his eyes met mine and he lost his smile . " I am very sorry for what happened , " he said . I could see this was going to be an impossible conversation . His mood was somber and apologetic , but the place was noisy  --  brass band , people dancing and flailing their arms , old women shrieking . I had to ask him to repeat that sentence , and the second time , shouting it so that I would hear it , he sounded insincere . But I knew he was not . " The family is very ashamed ! " he yelled . " Let 's not talk about it . " " We found the boy ! We beat him ! We took some money ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . But I could , and I did n't want to . " Why arc you not drinking your beer ? " " I 'm sick ! " The svn-ptoms were gone but I was still taking the penicillin . George smiled : he did n't understand . He went on shouting.  |p306I  pretended I could n't hear him through the music and the noise , and at last he gave up . Eventually he said , " Femi wants to see you . " It was what I wanted to hear . I stood up , and George followed me outside . As soon as we had left the noise of the club and were in the street , George changed . The apologies were over . He laughed at the heavy traffic and the horns . He told me he was planning to study engineering in Kaduna . He talked about his own life . And he seemed relieved to be talking about something other than Femi  --  that talk was lost and forgotten in the twanging music and the shadows of the club . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . After all that effort he had nothing more to say . George had given me Femi 's address without telling me where it was . The taxi driver snorted when I told him , and he drove for an hour , never leaving the same ruined road . It was midday , and we went slowly in a line of contending cars , past low buildingsand daubed signs . Did it look familiar to me because the whole of Lagos looked chaotically the same ? It was an ugly place . Its noise and heat seemed like other aspects of the same disorder . That  --  the ruin  --  was real . Everything else was unreal . It was not a city , the money was worthless , the food was bad , the air stank , the poorest people were extravagantly dressed in bandannasand bright robes , with turbans and sashes and crisply folded togas . It was the way Femi was clothed . Her turban matched her gownlike dress , the purple and white cloth shot through with gold thread ; and there was something Egyptian in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth wrapped neatly on her head , and even in her features , slanted and slightly hooded eyes and full lips and rising cheekbones  --  pharaonic . She was like a black cat wrapped in gold cloth . That was how she looked when she shoved aside the rag that hung in place of a door . A chicken ran out from behind her , its head down , clucking madly . Her village  --  if it was a village  --  was near the airport . It was part of the continuous ruin by the roadside . The planes roared low overhead , landing , taking off , leaving a smell of diesel fuelp307in the hot air . Gray soap bubbles and gobs of toothpaste ran in a trickle of wastewater through a furrow in the dirt and gurgled into a ditch  --  a lovely sound that made me look at the nauseating thing . Femi 's hut was made of paper and planks and flattened oil cans . But she was a beauty . We did n't kiss  --  we shook hands : her mother was there . Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentive . She was also dressed in a lovely gown , with a shawl and a drooping headdress . She watched us closely while we were standing in the dusty hut , but as soon as we sat down on oppositesides of the room she seemed to lose interest and she drifted away . " So , where are you coming from ? George said London . I said hall ! " " I was in London for Christmas . " " Sometimes even Nigerians go to London for Christmas , " Femi said . She had heavy lidded eyes that became absolutely unseeing when she was scornful . " I think it is a bloody waste of time . " " Where would you go . " She looked up , becoming interested again . " Maybe to Ikeja . " She was from Ikeja . " Or maybe to Uganda . " I had hoped she would n't say that . " Everyone misses you , " I said . " The people are very primitive , but it is a pretty place , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . That is why they are friendly . Bush people  --  " A plane went overhead , perhaps taking off , perhaps landing . It drowned the rest of her words . She finished her sentence with a shrug . " You like it better here ? " " Cities are better , " she said . " I do n't like it here . But this is my mother 's house . I came here after the surgery and just stayed . " I almost asked U'hat surgery ? until it struck me what the euphemismstood for . She stared at nie . She was theatrically dressed , as for an opera or a pageant of sonic sort , something unreal ; but the things she said were factual . They ' ctrl sleep and made me remember.  | " How is your life ? " she asked . " Moving right along , " I said . " And yours ? " " Not so bad . I 'm still weak , " she said . " I thought I would never stop bleeding . They said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they told me afterwards . " Her lids grew heavier and made her haughty again and more pharaonic as she raised her head . Her mother reappeared . She had a skull-like simian face , the color of shoe leather and just as dry and full of creases . She entered laughing softly and set a bottle of orange soda onto a plate . She produced two glass tumblers from a cloth , and wiped them with the cloth , and poured the orange soda into them , taking her time and laughing , not hearing anything but watching with wet reddened eyes . " Why did n't they tell me before ? That people die of it ? " Femi said . The mother had distracted me from what Femi had been saying , and so I asked a simple question and then regretted it as soon as Femi answered . " Because they ca n't stop the bleeding , " Femi said . " And I lost so much blood I was fainting all the time . I took iron tablets . I am still anemic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , as another roared past , making the flimsy walls of the hut vibrate . " And my family was ashamed of me , " Femi was saying . " But that 's over now . You can finish your studies . " Femi looked away . She was n't listening to me . She said , " When I left this place to be with you in Uganda they were so happy . It was such an adventure . They were proud of me . George was boasting about me . " She frowned and said , " And me , I was happy as well . " I said quickly , " It was n't my fault . " " And when I came back so soon they were just sulking like hell . " She touched her turban , steadying it with a long red fingernail and said , " I did not think I would come back . It is horrible to go back when you do n't want to . " " I did n't want it , Femi . " " It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse . I mean , then I had to go to the village . " " Which village ? "  | " Where they do these things . Where they cut you . Where the old woman was living . She was big and fat . She cut me . That is why I was bleeding . " As she said bleeding another plane went over . It became a drone and a dog barked crazily , choking on its barks . The air in Femi 's hut smelled of dampness and heat and of the ditchwater with the toothpaste and soap scum that stood bubbling beside the hut . " You did n't have to go to the village , " . I said . " But I wanted to finish my studies . " " Did you start in September ? " She half closed her eyes . It meant no . " I was still bleeding then . " I hated this conversation . It was like visiting  --  not a hospital but a leprosarium or a village of sick people . There was a patheticstink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? This incident was all that linked us now . She had visited me in Uganda , and after a month with me she said she was pregnant  --  two months pregnant , the doctor said . At first I had said , That 's impossible . But I was wrong . She had another life , and so she had returned to it , and I had tried to forget about her . I had visited her out of friendship , but I did not want to hear this . " And the boy did n't give me enough money , so my father paid for it . " " I would have given you the money . " " Why should you ? It was not your problem . " That was true . " It was the other boy . " She was twenty-one , but we were all boys to her . It had made me feel like a boy but it had turned me into a man  --  and it had turned her into a woman . Yet she was n't bitter . Her manner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting married . He was from Onitsha , an Ibo . And these days he is fearing about the fighting . There is trouble in the eastern region . It is all shit . I want to go away . Are you angry ? " I shook my head : no . " White people look angry much of the time , " she said.  | " I 'm not angry , honey . " " But I made you sad , " she said . As she changed position on the chair her gown shifted and the purple and gold tumbled over her knees . " I was sad . And I was sick , too . " There were dogs and children bawling outside , as though competing or quarreling , the mutts and the kids , and with this racket was a jangling of tin plates . " Maybe you can come to Uganda sometime for a visit , " I said . She smiled , but it was a sad smile , and she made a noise that sounded like no . " I think you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face twisted like a little girl 's , frowning , and she looked funny and glum , not wanting to be pitied . When she made that face I was reminded of how I had loved her , how she had seemed solid and patient and tender ; and how I had hated to see her go . The worst of it was that she had blamed herself for it all , and that she had been brokenhearted , facing her family . " You 'll be happy , too , " I said . " I never will be , " she said . " But I can try . " Her mother put her head through the ragged curtains andchattered at us , urging us to drink the orange soda . " She thinks I am stupid . When you go she will criticize me . " " Then I wo n't go , " I said . " You must go , " she said flatly . " I do n't care about this old woman , my mother . She wants me to be someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " And then I began to ache , and to wish that I could take her back with me . But it was too late . We had had our chance and had made a mess of it . " They all say , Where is your beautiful Nubian ? ' " " Those stupid people , " Femi said , and she laughed . She was pleased . " What is a Nubian ? " " It is a tall black woman with a lovely long neck , from the Sudan . " " The bush ! " she said , and made a dismissive click with her bright teeth . " Have you got a girl now ? " " No , " I said . " No one . " " You can find one , " she said . " If you have trouble I  --  vill findp311one for you . " And she laughed again at the absurdity of it . " A nice village girl who will cook your meals and be very quiet . One that is a bit primitive and obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! " And she laughed again . " I am a modern girl . I like the fast life  --  music and dancing . I like reading books , too . I listen to the wireless . I use lipstick . " " I want one like you . " " That is nice , " she said , nodding her head and then elevating it in pride , becoming a Nubian . " That is a nice thing to say . " She smiled at me . " I am glad you said that , because when you leave I am going to be sad again . " " Do n't you have a friend ? " She closed her eyes briefly : no . " That stupid boy got married in Enugu , and he is afraid to come here because there is going to be a war . " She sighed and said , " I would like to go away in a plane "  --  one had just gone overhead  --  " but I think I never will . I can forget the other thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid when I do n't know what is coming . " I was glad when her mother returned and pressed me to eat , because the rest was ritual . I ate  --  steamed yams and stew , while the mother and daughter served me , saying nothing . They brought me a basin of water ; I washed my hands ; I said I had to go  --  I had an appointment at the Ministry of Information , for my article , that did n't include any of this . Femi walked with me to the road . Dressed in her robes , she seemed especially tall and stately , with her fine turban and the bangles on her wrists , and her haughty eyes . The wrecked huts were all around us , and the mangy dogs and dirty children , and the tin shacks and the planes overhead screeching so loudly that when at last we kissed she exclaimed and her words were lost . I could not hear her , but she was laughing , and I wished I knew why.  |p312At  dusk in Kampala , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bats  --  thousands of the mouselike things  --  flew squealing from the tall trees by the swamp and darkened the sky . That was how night fell every day in bat valley . From my taxi I saw them rising like shreds of soot , little fluttering smuts . I had just arrived back from Lagos , after that long Christmas trip . I looked up and saw the bats , and stared at them . The sight was not threatening . It was something that occurred every day in Wandegeya . So I knew where I was . It was n't horrible  --  I was home . My apartment smelled of my parrot , Hamid , the plastery odor of his droppings . The bird made a bubbly growl when he saw me , and I let him out of his cage and smoothed his gray feathers and stroked his beak . He flapped around the room for a while , and then settled down , gnawing the spines of my books . There was plenty of food in his bowl , and his cage was clean , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , and yet I had no desire . I was still infected , still taking penicillin . I saw there were cockroaches in the pantry  --  dozens of them , from the food that Jackson had left . A moldy loaf of bread and an open bag of flour were covered with roaches . I wondered whether I should fire him . He had a habit when he was in a hurry of sweeping garbage into a kitchen drawer and forgetting about it . That drawer was the origin of our roaches . I walked down to the Young Hok Grocery and the Chinese owner sold me some roach spray . After a satisfying hour of killing cockroaches and sweeping them up I unpacked my bag , made a stack of dirty laundry and looked over the books I had bought in London , Frantz Fanon 's The Wretched of the Earth , Conrad 's The Secret Sharer , and an old copy of Tarzan of the Apes . Reading Tarzan and drinking gin I dozed on the sofa and then dragged myself to bed . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to me over the previous three weeks : staying with Prasad , my affair with Rosamond ,  |p313catching  the clap from Francesca , and seeing Femi again . I lay in bed turning it over in my mind , wincing when I remembered mentioning marriage to Rosamond , angry at the thought of Francesca introducing me to her venereal Ghanaian , and depressedat the thought of Femi wearing her finery in her dusty hut , and I am still bleeding . A week here , a few days there , an afternoon , a long night : it had all been hectic , but I could not help thinking that it had been a failure . It was as though I had been to a party  --  a great whirl ; and I had come home alone . I stayed in bed , enjoying my loneliness , pitying myself in my solitude , and savoring the thought that I was in debt and would have to work hard to write three articles to pay for the trip . It was a week 's work : it did n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  concealing Francesca and the gonorrhea behindan essay on Ghanaian politics , and never letting on that in between my visits to Nigerian ministries I had seen Femi looking stately in her slum . And I would write something about England without mentioning Rosamond or S. Prasad . I hated conniving at what was unreal , and yet the concealment also fascinated me . I was not sure whether these different women and the odd and inconvenient events of their lives were more important and truer to the world than any of the stuff I wrote . Anyway , I suppressed it and kept it as my secret and so it was like a parallel history in private . I sometimes suspected that it was vastly more important than anything that I had made public , but that it accumulated far too fast for me to make sense of it . Much better for the moment to write these articles and to continue my novel about Yung Hok , the Chinesegrocer , another solitary man . I was happiest in this divided mood when I was speaking another language . Jackson came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I replied in Swahili . That other unreal self was let loose to be a bwana and jabber about his trip . I crouched inside him and looked around at the world . I went to my office at nine . Veronica , the Muchiga secretary , brought me a cup of coffee and asked me if I would please dictate a letter to her . " I want to take the examination , Mr. Anderea . I must improve mv speed . "  |p314I  dictated a letter to the prime minister of Uganda , objecting to the practice of female circumcision in the eastern region . " You are very rude , Mr. Anderea , " Veronica said , as she scribbledthe shorthand notations . She then typed it on the letterheadwhere I was named , Andrew Parent , B.A. , Acting Director , Adult Studies Institute . " We Bachiga have no female circumcision , " Veronica said , watching me make corrections in her typing . " No , but you have your delightful Urine Ceremony . " She gave me an earthy smile . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new bride putting her naked bottom on the hands of all her husband 's brothers and pissing , to seal the bond . " I think you also have funny customs , " she said . " Really , Veronica ? " " Europeans like to have toilets inside their houses , " she said . " I think it is very unclean . " " I agree . " She went away , giggling at her audacity , and I swiveled my chair around , so that I could look out the window . In the big splintered tree on the lawn outside my office there were gray herons nesting  --  I saw the mother heron shoving food down the open beaks of her fledglings . Beneath the tree the gardener was whacking clumps of weed with a sickle . He wore incredible rags that had once been trousers , and an overcoat from the King 's African Rifles , and a torn hat . He was perspiring and wiping his face with a brown rag . His bare feet were as big and as cracked as a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the students who had stayed for the holidays  --  classes had not yet begun . I recognized Francis Omolo , a purplish man from West Nile , who had all his bottom teeth knocked out , according to the custom of his tribe ; Mr. Kato , the schoolteacher from Trans-Nzoia , on the Kenya border ; Chango Muwenga , who wore a Mao button ; and an undersized man named Mgubi who lived on the other side of the Mountains of the Moon , among the pygmies of Bundihugyo . They stayed here , because it was too far to go home . They had books , but they sat on them . The grass was damp . At the edge of the lawn were bamboos and weaver birds madly shrieking in their nests . I could hear the bicycle bells and carp315horns and the buses changing gear beyond the hedge ; and I could just see the white minarets of the Ismaili mosque on a distant hill . Looking out this window I tried to call up the sight of the cold gleaming streets of London , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her fur hat and long coat , and I felt vaguely disatisfied that we had parted so coldly . Yet I could not imagine her here  --  or Francesca either . I could not imagine this place , or myself , any different . Africa was what it was  --  permanentlyunformed . It was clay that never hardened . It was much better for someone far away to think about it and picture it than for that person to come here and be disappointed by the broken streets and the noise and its incompleteness . And what would they make of the bats ? The name was enough . I envied people who had never seen Africa . I scribbled a memo , Books set in Africa by writers who had never been there . Tarzan , Henderson the Rain King , The Unbearable Bassingtonand . . . Veronica interrupted me with another cup of coffee , and I briefly felt happy , understanding that I was having difficultywriting my novel about the Africa of the Chinese grocer because it was an Africa that had never been described before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I make this real  --  the sunlight flooding my office and fading my books and yellowing the stack of curled-up letters on my shelves ? " Acting Director " was right . I was just a caretaker , helping this place along , keeping it dusted . No one expected very much , because this was Africa . None of us was under any pressure at all . We could never succeed , nor could we fail . I had a job here , though I did n't belong . I felt like Yung Hok , the Chinese grocer . As I stirred my coffee , the bursar rang . He said , " Have you been away ? " I said no , just to see whether he would challenge me  --  after all , I had been away almost a month . He laughed  --  three quacks . His name was Mr. Wangoosa . He was a member of one of those churches who believe you are either saved or damned . He was saved ; I was damned  --  he had made that plain enough to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to be polite to him . He had already consigned my soul to Hell . He asked me for the list of new students . I said I did n't have the list , and thought : What new students ?  | " I reckon you have masses in the pipeline , " he said . That was the current expression for being busy . I said , yes , though I did not have anything at all in the pipeline . I went home for lunch after that , walking slowly in the sunshine and cutting through the heat . Jackson had fried some bananas and made a curry . He said in Swahili , " I told the cook upstairs about your safari in Europe and what you said about West Africa  --  that it is no good . He was very excited to hear it . " " Good , " I said . I was eating , and he was hovering over me . " Do you know there are cockroaches in the kitchen ? " I did n't know the word for roaches  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will kill them completely , " he said , making a murderous swipe with his very large hand . " What food do you want to eat for dinner ? " " No dinner tonight , Jackson . " " Please give me some money , " he said . " Twenty shillings . " He had broken teeth and bloodshot eyes and a torn shirt and long skinny arms . He crushed the twenty shilling note in his hands and touched it to his forehead . " That woman Miss Rashida came looking for you , " he said . " I told her you were on safari in Europe . She will come back . " He left and I lay on the sofa , thinking about Rashida , and how complete this life was : a job , a house , a salary , and friends  --  even a girlfriend . When I was away I had forgotten it all ; and if I had stayed away I might never have remembered that I had a real life here . There was an Extra Mural class in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Adult Studies Institute . This class had been organized by my predecessor , another acting director . It was called English for Diplomats . The students were all embassy personnel in Kampala  --  a Greek , a Rwandan , an Egyptian , two Chinese , and the Italian ambassador . It was regarded as a coup to have an ambassador in the class , and as long as he attended we kept it going . The Chinese were from the People 's Republic , Mr. Chen and Mr. Sung . They wore Mao suits and they hardly spoke a word of English . Mr. Solferini the Italian was a dapper and veryp317courtly man who had lived in Somalia for twenty years . His English was poor but he was rich in gestures . He urged me to go to Somalia . It was a good place for hunting . Mogadishu , he said , and kissed his fingertips . Leopards , wild pigs , rabbits , birds . The rest of the class listened and watched . They were very shy . Usually we practiced speaking lines of a dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about borrowing money . " I waant to bowrow zum mooney frem yo , plis , " Mr. Solferini said . " Da iss da seko tie dis wik you ha as-kid me dat , " Mr. Chen said . " I nid eet forr an aimairgency , " Mr. Solferini said . " Emergency , " I said . " Hay-mergency , " he said . The rest of the diplomats listened with apprehension , fearful that I would ask them to speak . But everyone took a turn : that was the routine . They did so , stammering , trying to keep their dignity . After the class Mr. Chen and Mr. Sung lingered and presented me a copy of Volume One of The Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung and a recent issue of China Reconstructs , with a portrait of Mao on the cover . " Maybe you can teach me to speak Chinese , " I said . They laughed nervously at this . " I would like to go to China , " I said . " China , yes ! " They had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked panicky , and bowed , and hurried away . It seemed I was always talking to people who hardly knew English . But I did not mind , and I was often glad of it , because I was able to preserve the monologue in my mind , and rememberit . In London , speaking English all the time had tired me and made me lose track of time . It was another world . I had not been real there ; and I had just passed through Ghana , and listened in Lagos . I was happier here . Even the most exotic sights here  --  the bats , the herons , the Nubians with their teeth knocked out , the Dinkas ' foreheads , which were bumpy with ornamental scars , or the nmuslim svomen imr their black silk shrouds  --  were so familiarp318to me I found them restful . The Ugandan soldiers , always redeyedand drunk , seemed to me odder and more dangerous . But they kept to their camps and their roadblocks in the bush . The phone rang . It was the librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said I was dealing with it . I liked being able to say that meaningless sentence and for the librarian not to care . He was an English homosexual who lived in an apartment block that adjoined mine . He called his African lover his house boy . Like me he was real when he was home . All day I had been thinking about my articles  --  one about England , one about Ghana , one about Nigeria . If I had a good thought I could simply embroider upon it . I felt the excitement of having an idea that I had not set down  --  it was still fluid and provisional , ink that had not yet dried , like my life . I liked living in this temporary way . When the office was empty and Veronica had gone home I started my England article on her typewriter , and filled a page . Then I put it away . Night had fallen , the bats had flown . Africa smelled differently at night  --  it was less dusty , and had the damp fragrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screech of insects , the car horns , the shouts . Rafeekee , someone cried , callinghis friend . Rashida was waiting for me at my apartment , sitting on the steps , with her elbows on her knees . She said , " Your cook said you had come back . " She spoke in Swahili . She was shy because I had been away , and she always spoke Swahili when she was nervous . I said , " You look very pretty , habibi . " She was about seventeen and small , with a funny malicious face and skinny legs . Her lipstick made her look like a tough woman but when it wore off at the end of an evening she looked like a child . Today she was wearing a red dress and high heels and a yellow shawl . Her cheap jewelry jangled and she looked lovely to me . She had large brown eyes and long lashes . She was proud of her Hamitic nose and thin face . " Are you hungry ? " " I ate some bananas . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swahili , but she replied in English , " No beer . I do n't want , " as though to impress Allah with her indignation.  |p319We  went inside and Hamid began to squawk , imitating the squeaky door . Rashida called to him  --  kasuku , parrot . " How long were you waiting for me ? " She shrugged  --  did n't know , did n't care . " I want to go dancing , " she said , and then coyly , " No jig jig . " " First jig jig , then dancing . " She just laughed and twisted her shawl tighter . I poured her a glass of orange squash , and opened a bottle of beer for myself . Rashida drank in silence , and I distractedly examined the label of the beer bottle , the script of Indian Pale Ale and the emblem of a bell , from the brewery on Lake Victoria . I drank that one and another , glad that I had taken the last of my penicillin at breakfast . Rashida was playing with the parrot , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and switched off the light . She got up shyly and sat beside me on the sofa . The curtains were open and the glimmer from outside was enough light . I hugged Rashida and ran my hands over her and kissed her . She primly kept her hands in her lap , and her knees together , and when I made a move to lift her dress she resisted . I laughed and kissed her again , and was aroused . It was the first time since Ghana that I had had any desire . " Let 's jig jig , then we 'll go to a nightclub , " I said , and slipped my hand under her dress . " You are a monkey , " she said . " Yes . I am a monkey . " " Tell me you love me . " " I love you , " I said , and I thought : I am not real  --  this is playing , this is fun . " I love you , habibi . " She kissed me , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her dress off , and folded it carefully on the sofa so that it would n't wrinkle . She was wearing a red slip , edged with lace that I had given her , and a pair of red shoes that were scuffed from all her walking . She yawned , twistingher slender body inside the flimsy slip , and I reached out for her . She dodged my hands and hurried into the bedroom on her clacking shoes . Not then but later as she was leaving the bedroom to go to the toilet , she opened the ( loot ' and paused and looked hack at me . In the light from the hall she looked lovely  --  delicate and black , like a kitten , on het tiptoes . She said in English , " I am coatingp320just now "  --  to reassure me that she was n't running away  --  and I felt my desire for her returning in me , and thought : I am happy . We made love again , and she was like a cat , biting my neck , clawing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until finally she shuddered and lay still . " I am not finished , " I said . " What do you want ? " she said calmly . I told her . " Do you love me ? " " I love you , habibi . " She smiled and pushed me down tenderly . After that , we went dancing at the Gardenia , until I was too tired to move . I dropped her at her house just a hut near the Indian beauty parlor where she worked . " I have no money , " she whispered . I gave her some , pretending to be drunker than I was . And this is n't real either , I thought . The days passed . I went to my office and dictated letters to Veronica . I wrote my articles . She typed them . Mr. Wangoosa asked me about students and plans . " Everything 's in the pipeline , " I said . Nothing was in the pipeline , but each day had its events . The parrot woke me with its squawks when Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and papaya , and now and then Jackson fried me an egg . I read the Uganda Argus in my office , and at eleven went to the Senior Common Room for a coffee with the other faculty members . Back to my office , to sit and look at the herons , until lunchtime , usually at The Hindoo Lodge , with Neogy and Desai . If we had a curry we always went to the panwallah afterwards , and I walked home with a wedge of pan in my mouth , and spitting betel juice along Kampala Road . After a nap I went to the office again and answered the phone . " I 'm dealing with it . " " I 'm studying the file . " " It 's in the pipeline . " And then teatime flowed into sundowner time at the Staff Club , and I drank beer  --  often with Rashida  --  until I was drunk . I love you , habibi , we said . Saturdays were simpler . I shopped at Yung Ilok 's , and then had a curry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we danced and niadc love and slept until noonp321on Sunday , when the London papers went on sale at Shah 's . One Sunday I read about the demonstrations in London and saw pictures of the angry students . I understood their anger , but I hated the unanimity of the mob . Rashida was fascinated by their heavy coats and hats , their beards and scarves . That Sunday , like all the rest , we spent the afternoon in the Botanical Gardens , and we finished the day in bed . The bush-baby returned . It scratched on the screen and seemed to plead for food . I gave it fruit  --  soft melons and droopingbananas  --  and it was always eager for more . It clung to the window . I went on feeding it , but I never let it in . What would it do inside my room ? Rashida had no name for it except nyama , which meant meat or animal and was interchangeable . She was nyama , and so was I.I kept my office hours ; clocked in , clocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote my Yung Hok novel in my office , because there was no other work to do until the students came back . I could not imagine being happier . Kampala was a lovely place , of yellow-plaster shops under leafy trees ; a small town scattered across seven rounded hills . I read Robinson Crusoe , and felt it was like my life . I read Tarzan and felt the same . I read Victory and The Secret Sharer . I was the hero of every book I read . I did not envy anyone , or want anyone else 's life . I had everything I wanted . I could only imagine someone envying me . But I felt I was unlike anyone else on earth  --  not better , but different  --  andthat , having just realized that , I had just begun to live . So my whole life was ahead of me . I was twenty-six years old . Rashida laughed when I asked her about her plans for next week : the future hardly existed for her . Her laughter was genuine . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it took away all her questions . But she was particular about her appearance  --  very conscious of her shoes and her dress . Her hair was always done  --  the other girls at work experimented on her . She mocked me for wearing sneakers with a suit , or a T-shirt with a sports jacket . " You dress like an African in the hush , " she would say , lookingscornful . Only appearances nattered . It was so easy to forget how muchp322people cared about fashions in Uganda . If you wore the wrong clothes you were conspicuous . But this also made life simple . I had to remind myself that I was no more than a white man to anyone here  --  most of all to the other whites . So I kept all my secrets . I had a disguise that no one in Africa could crack : a white face . One of those nights when Rashida laughed at my mismatched clothes we went to see Thunderball , a James Bond movie , at the Majestic . Rashida loved James Bond , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movie . Afterwards we drifted to the Gardenia , and danced among the prostitutes and drunken men . Later , walking down Kampala Road I heard an inhuman shriek  --  like a monkey that had caught fire . It was an Indian boy being cornered by an angry African , Rashida said  --  " Muhindi . " But she herself must have been part Indian  --  one of those in-between people in East Africa to whom no rules applied except the code of Islam . For a woman this meant obedienceand prayers and no alcohol , though I never saw her pray . The Indian 's shrieks seemed to excite her . She hurried me to my apartment and took off her dress . She kissed me , and struggled , encouraging me . She had an eager way of touching me all over with her fingertips , and when she was most passionate I could feel the frantic bones beneath her flesh . " Do you love me ? " " Yes . I love you . " And then she gasped , and devoured me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , afterwards . She was breathing hard , her eyes were bright . There were two single beds , pushed together . We lay in the one nearer the window , where I always saw the bush-baby . " I want to sleep here . " With that , she began to snore softly . She smelled of her hut , its dirt floor and its dog ; of perfume and sweat and hairspray . I woke to pandemonium  --  screams and alarms , car alarms , burglar alarms , a riot of bells and beeps . At first I felt I had caused it all , but I could not get out of bed to find out . The room seemed to twist in the darkness , the walls were brightly streaked from the lights flashing outside  --  what strange emergency was this , or was it a nightmare ? I thought the room was going to lhllp323on me . The gray ceiling whitened and seemed to ripple and bend towards me . It was not a dream . It was an earth tremor , and it set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute or so of the earth 's movement and my room 's twistings . I sweated and listened to the sirens . It had all passed , but I was afraid when I thought of it and how we might have died like that . I stayed awake , scarcely able to breathe . Rashida did not stir . It was Sunday . She slept until noon . There was no word in Swahili for it , or if there was no one knew it . We all spoke it badly there  --  it was n't anyone 's native language , and it was hardly a language at all , more like three hundredeveryday words . " Earthquake " was not one of them . But it did not need a name : everyone had felt it . The next day everyone was talking about it . One of the minarets of the Ismaili mosque had fallen down , and cracks had appeared in the parliamentbuilding , and on the stone porch of the Aga Khan School . The lights had short-circuited on the antenna at Wireless Hill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the National and Grindlay 's Bank a large mirror had shattered . It was otherwise pretty harmless . Kampala was not a fragile town . So it was a thrill , and our pleasure of having lived through an extraordinary event resulted in a whole friendly day of perfectstrangers talking to one another . " I thought it was thieves . " " I thought I was drunk . " " Did you see the mosque ? " Rashida had slept through it . She laughed at my attempts to describe it , because there was no word for it . I said the earth shook , and I tried to show her how it kit . She said , " You are dancing , " and laughed . Her laughter annoyed me . It was not just the silliness of it , nor/my feeling like a buffoon for doing a charade of an earthquake because I did n't know the word for it , nor my irritation that she had slept through it all . The fact was that she did n't care . Even if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cared and would probably have laughed . Her fatalism would have turned it into one of those things she always accepted . For me it had been a nightmare . If I laughed I did so out of blind paralytic fear  --  my giggle like a death rattle . I might have died in that narrow bed with this snoring teenager beside me . It was not how I wanted to go  --  crushed and buried by the cinderblocks of Semakokiro House , the staff quarters , at the age of twenty-six . The memory of it frightened me . I had not known that cement walls could bend without breaking . I kept imagining bricks falling on my face . Rashida said , " It was the wind . " For a moment I wanted to hit her for being so stupid . And then I saw how foolish it would be to hit her . An instant later I lost all interest in her . She was still laughing at me . I took her home to her hut . I needed someone to share my fear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . They were afraid of another quake . Most of the Africans felt it was a judgment  --  felt this not because they were ignorant savages from the bush but because they were Christians of a fairly forbidding type . The white expatriatesdid not have a better explanation . I cruised in my car until the bats flew off , and then went back to Rashida 's . " She has gone out , " a woman said from the depths of the hut . Rashida always called this brown , serious woman " auntie , " and I had surprised her in her old faded wraparound . " Did she go alone ? " " No . With an Indian . " I was not jealous . I was cross with myself for having sworn that I was not going to see her tonight and then as a last resort dropping by , assuming she would be waiting . Why should she wait for me ? I knew there was an Indian she liked  --  because he had a car and he took her dancing . He gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had made into dresses . Did he know I gave her fancy underwear ? It was very dark in Wandegeya , and it was quieter now that thep325bats had taken off . It was too late to go to the movies , too early to go home . I could have gone to the Hindoo Lodge but tonight I did not want to eat dinner alone . I saw some Africans peering through the back window of a shop , hanging on to the shutters and the bars , where inside an Indian family was watching I Love Lucy . In this nighttime neighborhood anyone with electricity was conspicuous . You saw them through their windows because it was too hot for them to close their shutters . And when your eyes became accustomed to the darkness you could see the Africans by the roadside , standing or sitting , waiting for buses , roasting ears of corn , stirring peanut stew , staring back at you . I hated driving at night , because of these wandering Africans on the road , and the cyclists and the dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in my car in the black night near Rashida 's hut , not thinking of her , but only of the earth tremor and the way my ceiling had twisted and seemed to fall , and all those burglar alarms that had made my heart pound . When there was nowhere to go and nothing to do in Kampala there was always the Staff Club . It was just a room in an old building that stood on its own under a drooping gum tree . It had been chosen for its isolation , because of the noise . There was music  --  a phonograph beside the bar . And there were always shouts , but friendly ones . The members felt happy and heroic for being misfits . I saw some bright drunken faces under the lights , through the open windows . Three cars were parked in the long grass . As soon as I shut my engine off I heard the voices  --  not angry , just loud and boozy , someone contradicting someone else . It was Crowbridge , shouting , but he stopped when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Bwana Parent , " Crowbridge said . " So you all survived the earthquake , " I said . There was a silence . Crowbridge said , " We 're not talking about that . We 're sick of hearing about it . If you want to talk about it you can bugger off right now , bwana . " " You 're interrupting something , Andy , " Potter said . ( Trowbridge went on with his story . I knew it was about a man named I lassett , who had leftp326Uganda at Independence , because Crowbridge said  --  he was speaking to Potter  --  " You remember his hangovers ? He said if he could sleep till noon he 'd be all right , but if someone woke him at eleven he 'd suffer all day . Anyway , that bitch from Kololo we used to call the Marchioness of Gush was after him somethingchronic . She rang him up at half-past ten one morning . He had really tied one on the night before . He was still half full of alcohol . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not take personal calls at my residence before noon , now please get off the line ! ' Bangs down the receiver . " Mungai and Okello laughed , thinking the story was over , but Crowbridge took no notice of them . " A few days later he was going past the post office . You know how he was  --  the way all drunks are  --  different every hour of the day . At five o'clock he was positively friendly . There 's the Marchioness up ahead with her two daughters , and they 're all tits and teeth . Hassett says , Why hello there . I did n't realize that you had such a lovely family . Give me a ring sometime  --  I 'm usually at home in the morning . ' " This time no one laughed . Potter yawned into his hand . Mungaiand Okello looked apprehensive . Crowbridge went on drinking . He did n't seem to mind that his story had fallen flat . They were always telling stories about people who were n't there . As soon as you left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the way you looked , or how much you had drunk . An African named Kwasanja was at the far end of the bar with Godby 's wife  --  Godby nowhere in sight  --  talking to her in an aggrieved way . " I did n't mind it when they called me black , " he said . " But when they called me colored I hated it . I said to my landlady , What do you mean colored ? What color , eh ? ' She did not know what to say . She was just some bloody working-class woman . " Godby 's wife said without any feeling , " I 'm a bloody workingclasswoman . " Then she turned to me and said , " You have n't paid your bar bill . " She did not like me much . A year before , sitting together at the Staff Club  --  we were alone  --  I said , " Let 's lock up this place and go to my house for a. drink . " She knew what I meant . But when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham ! Graham ! " and I stopped , withdrew , could n't go on . Shep327punched me and began to cry with frustration , but what could I do ? Graham was her husband , a junior lecturer in the Geography Department . Her name was Alma . She always wore big loose dresses , even though she was rather small . She chain-smoked , sitting hunched at the bar holding her cigarette like a monkey clutching a nut . I liked her indifference to things , the way she simply came along when I said , " Let 's go . " I had been shocked to hear her say her husband 's name  --  surprised when she raised her voice . She sometimes brought her little baby to the Staff Club , and he sat drooling in a stroller while she drank . She had a degree in mathematics but was refused a job in the Math Department because the head of it , an old-timer named Tarpey , said he did n't want a bloody woman on the staff . So Alma did the bar accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about time you settled your bill . " " I 've been away , " I said . " England , actually . " " I do n't believe you , " she said . " You 're not due for leave for another year . " " I was n't on leave . I was on vacation . " " What a waste of money , " Alma said . " You could 've gone to Mombasa . " " Where 's that poppsie of yours , Andrew ? " Crowbridge said . " I do n't have a poppsie . " " That Nubian , " he said . " She 's not a fucking Nubian , " I said . Potter said , " I think the really attractive ones are the Batoro . Fort Portal is full of crumpet . " " And Kabale as well , " Kwasanja said . He was from Kabale . They began one of the standard Staff Club discussions : which African women were the prettiest . " Who 's barman ? " I said . " I 'd like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of IndianPale Ale out of the vibrating refrigerator . " And a double gin for me , " Okello said . Pouring the second tot , Crowbridge held the almost empty bottle up for all to see , showing us that there was less than a tot swilling at the hottoln . " Barman 's tot , " he said , and added it to his glass.  | " We should have real music , " Potter said . " We should have food . We could do sandwiches . We could do a five-bob lunch . " " Bring it up at the next meeting , " Alma said . " I am buying you one bottle of beer , " Okello said , moving to the stool next to Alma 's and placing the bottle in front of her . " Thanks very much , but you 're not getting anything from me , " Alma said . She was pleased with herself and sucked smoke out of her pinched cigarette . Did she remember howling Graham ! Graham ! Poor Godby , everyone fucked his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the impression that after all this drinking and screwing , the Godbys would go back to England and live a quiet little life in a place like Walton-on-Thames , as though nothing had happened . People lived in a wild and reckless way here , but they seldom got hurt . Africa had a reputation for danger , but the worst of it was the boredom , the long nights , the yearning for something else , the stories I had heard before . Yet there was always Mombasa . Crowbridge said , " I have to go . Who wants to be barman ? Potter ? " " I will do it , " Okello said , as Potter shrugged . " Mind you sign the chits , " Crowbridge said . " Do n't make a pig 's breakfast of it . " And he left . I had not realized how drunk he was until I heard him start his car , and grind his gears , and go humping and bumping through the grass . " You were in Nyasaland , Andrew , were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reply , went on , " There 's masses of patchouli there . The department needs some . " He was in the Botany Department . " Know anyone there who 'd send me some ? " I tried to think of someone . There was not a soul . I did not write to anyone there , I could hardly remember their names . The Americans were gone . The Africans I knew could barely write . I had left them all behind . I seemed to be going from world to world . " There must be someone , " I said , knowing there was n't . Kwasanja was singing to a record , MalaikaNakupenda malaikaNamini fa nyenye ...  |p329Then  he signed his chits and left  --  another drunken car , bumpingthrough the grass . Okello poured himself a drink from the newly opened bottle of gin . In the same motion he raised the bottle to his mouth and took a long swig , his Adam 's apple pounding . " Christ on a bike ! " Potter cried . " Barman 's tot , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " You 're signing for that , Festus ! " It was the first time I had ever heard Okello 's Christian name . Mungai said , " When I was in London they did worse things than that . " " This club is losing money , " Potter said . " Ask Alma . She does the books . Is it funny , Alma ? " " I would n't know , " she said . " I 'm going home . " " And me , I am going , " Okello said , following her through the door , to the darkness and damp grass . Mungai said , " Over Christmas she wanted me to poke her . Wewent to Wireless Hill in my car . I tried , but I could n't ! " " That 's no way to talk about Alma Godby , " Potter said . " You 'd better be careful , mate . " " I am drunk , " Mungai said . He was smiling , perhaps thinking of Alma in his car on Wireless Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going home , " Mungai said , and staggered out . " The bastard did n't sign his last chit , " Potter said . The song Malaika stopped . There was silence . " Over Christmas she wanted me  --  to poke her , ' " Potter said angrily , mimicking Mungai . " What 's wrong with these people ? " He began tidying the bar , putting bottles away , banging them down . I did not share his anger . I too had tried to poke Alma Godby . " How did you know Okello 's name is Festus ? " " He was a student of mine , " Potter said . " They 're all former students . Kwasanja read economics and did a degree in political science at LSE . Mungai was one of Peter 's students . He 's a bright chap . Ile drinks too much and he talks too much , but then , " lie smiled , " so do we all . " I took another peer out Ul the refrigerator , and opened it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to imagine what sort of students Okello and Kwasanja had been . Probably very hardworkingand optimistic , preparing themselves for Uganda 's independenceand following the advice of their young teachers , Crowbridge and Potter . Now they were all drunks , taking turns with Alma Godby . " Quiet tonight , " Potter said , looking up from the paper . " Where is everyone ? " " There 's a jazz night in town , " he said . " At that bar near the museum . " " What 's a jazz night ? " " Loud music and cheap wine , " Potter said . " Gramophone records . Waste of time , if you ask me . " He began filling his pipe , pushing tobacco in with his thumb . Then he paused , stared into space for a minute , and smiled . " This is much cozier , " he said . He arranged his things on the bar counter , his tobacco and pipe , his matches , his knife , his tamper , newspaper , glass of gin , bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk , becoming very orderly , the way some drunks in the club did . I said nothing , only watched , remembering the earth tremor . " Oh , yes . Festus was a very bright chap , " he said . " Years ago . " He wanted to reminisce . He was n't even thirty-five , and he was looking backwards . I said , " Which bar near the museum ? " " Waste of time , " he said . " Have a drink , Andy . " " I 've got one , thanks . " I do n't want to spend another night in this place , I thought . Potter said , " Did you see Festus following Alma out the door ? " He smacked his lips . " I can see him driving his hand smartly up her jumper . " Nor did I want to ponder that . " I think I 'll go down to the jazz club , " I said . Potter frowned . " I might as well go with you . " We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name , but it was easy to spot  --  all the cars , all the music and noise . It was Dixieland music , and the bar looked like a little roadhouse anywhere in the world . We parked under a thorn tree and pushed through the crowd on the veranda  --  they were all talking about the earth tremor , what it had felt like , what they had thought itp331was . They had the tipsy hysteria of survivors , congratulating themselves that they were still alive . At the bar Potter said , " Ca n't even get a bloody drink . " I saw a very pretty blonde , about twenty or so , talking to a big bald man on a settee against a wall . The man got up and went into the other room . I said to myself , Oh well . I went over and sat down next to the blonde . She smiled at me , but more in surprise than in welcome . " Hello , " I said , and just saying that single word convinced me that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She sighed . She said with feeling , " It frightened me rigid . Everyone thinks it was so funny . I hated it . " I wanted her to say more  --  it was what I wanted to hear . To encourage her I said , " Hey , I was scared shitless . " " You 're an American , " she said . " How did you know that ? " She smiled again , and then laughed softly . I said , " Are you with anyone tonight ? " " Yes . He 's just gone to the loo . " I said , " Then listen carefully . Meet me on the steps of the library at six-thirty tomorrow . Okay ? " She nodded , because the big bald man was approaching with a look of alertness on his face and that same tension was visible on his scalp , too . I excused myself and ducked out , amazed at my boldness . On the way back , Potter said , " What did I tell you ? Waste of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge , and I lingered because I was so relieved . She was sitting on the low steps of the library , smoking a cigarette . She did not have the thoughtful and vexed expression of a person waiting for a stranger , but rather shep332looked contented , with light on her face , the last bright sunshine before the sun dropped beneath the trees . In that moment before we met I had the irrational thought that we knew each other and were friends . Of course it was n't true . It was a good feeling though  --  happiness and flickering hope . She was smiling . She stood up and stamped on her cigarette when she saw me crossing the road . With the sun in her hair and in her summer dress she was very pretty . She was nearly as tall as me . She looked confident , and it was only when she spoke that I realized she was shy  --  but shy in an English way , watchful and formal and a little hesitant . " Shall we get a drink somewhere ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . And she was saying , Oh , yes  --  That 's fine  --  Wherever you say . I said , " What about the Veranda ? " It was a bar that adjoined the Speke Hotel . " Is n't that expensive ? " she said , and smiled again . I was touched , because it was n't expensive at all , but just another bar in a town that was full of them . " You 're a student , " I said . Students were always thinking about money and economizing in bewildering ways . " Yes . I 'm getting a Dip Ed . " " And what are you going to do with it ? " " Go into the bush and teach , " she said , with such eager independencethat I felt excluded and already a bit abandoned . At the Veranda we found a table under the trees , which had strings of lights in their branches . They were flame trees , and a blossom plopped on the table as soon as we sat down . " Maybe I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked it up and fixed it over her ear . She looked exotic . Then she glanced into her compact mirror and frowned . " God , I look stupid ! " She clawed it out of her hair . The waiter brought us our drinks . She sipped hers and seemed detached and appreciative . I guzzled mine out of nervousnessand said , " I did n't think you 'd be there . " " I did n't think I would either , " she said . " I 'm fussy about being picked up . " " You must be . I mean "  --  I was still guzzling  --  " you let me pick you up . "  | " I had other plans but they fell through , " she said . There was not the trace of a smile on her lips . " Really ? " I said . " That bald guy ? Was he busy ? " " He 's actually very nice . He 's an anthropologist , studying the Bwamba . He 's frightfully het up about their circumcision cere-monies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were you ? " She laughed and said , " Do n't listen to me . I did n't have any other plans . I went to the dentist today and had a tooth pulled . To tell you the truth I did n't think I was going to make it to the library . But I 'm glad I did . " She took another sip of her drink . " I feel better already . " " I was glad to see you . " " You mean that , do n't you ? " She touched my hand , but casually , as though in a reflex , like touching wood for luck . She inhaled the fragrance of the flowers around us and said how happy she was to be here . " In this bar ? " " In Africa . " " Why is it that people in Africa are always talking about being in Africa ? " I said . She did not reply , so I went on , " It might be nice to live somewhere else , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach , " she said . It sounded like a reproach , but it was the strength of her conviction that made it seem so . " I would n't want to be anywhere else . " I knew exactly how she felt : it was the way I had felt in Nyasaland , my first year . She loved being in Africa . Very well , so did I. And so I chatteredand boasted , trying to impress her , because I wanted to see her again . I was the acting director of the Institute , I said . I ran the place , I had eighty students and five part-time lecturers . I did n't tell her that everyone else had quit and gone home , that I was the only person left to do the job and as soon as a qualified African applied I would be replaced . I told her that we had regional centers all over Uganda and that I would shortly be setting off to visit them . " I 'd love that kind of job , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come along ...  | " You do n't need my help , " she said . She was very firm  --  I admired her for it . But I was also wondering how it was possible to tempt her . I could see that she had a definite objective  --  being in Africa , teaching in the bush , being independent . She was a free spirit , and she knew what she wanted . I could not be part of her plans . My job was here , in Kampala . And I had no other plans . I was careful in my questions . I did not want to be disappointedby any of her replies . She said she was a Londoner ; she had gone to Oxford ; she liked Wordsworth and D. H. Lawrence ; she was a socialist , her father worked for the Water Board , she had acted in various plays  --  Rosalind in As You Like It in a studentproduction . This was just chat ; I did not want to go any deeper and discover that she had a lover . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the waiter brought us the bill . She meant it  --  it was another example of her insistence on being independent . I was impressed but a little uneasy  --  I was n't used to women paying their way . I said , " Do you want to see the best view in Kampala ? " She seemed puzzled but said yes , and I drove her to Wireless Hill . We parked on the edge of the summit and looked out at all the lights . This hill was a place for furtive lovers who had cars  --  there were two other cars parked nearby , and people embracingon the front seats of them . The lights were scattered in the bowl of the town , and behind the mosque and the cathedral and the illuminated mansions and monuments was the impenetrableblackness of the Ugandan forest on one side , and Lake Victoria in the distance , under a warm and pockmarked moon . I kissed her , and we embraced innocently for a while , just holding on , as though consoling each other . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally I said , " I really like you . " " You hardly know me . " " I know enough . " Then she relented . " I 'm glad you like me , " she said . " I like you too . " As she said it I saw that the car parked next to mine was Graham Godby 's old Austin . Inside , Alma Godby 's head was jammed against the rear window . An African with her , smilingp335with effort , his eyes popping , I saw very clearly was Festus Okello . They looked as though they were beating time to music with their wagging heads . But I knew better , and just as Alma 's head seemed to flatten against the glass and slip down , I turned away . It was embarrassing because it was predictable , the Kampala custom of getting laid on Wireless Hill . It was always adulterous expatriates , and I saw there was something selfish and routine about it . I had parked there many times in just that way  --  becausethis was where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more secret than a borrowed apartment or the little hotel in Bombo that we called the knocking-shop . This was where an adulterer took someone to be safe from his mistress . It was one of the darker and more desperate places . I had once found that thrilling , but when I saw Alma and Festus in that trembling car I became flustered . It seemed to me a bad beginningfor us . I said , " I like you so much that "  --  thinking fast  --  " I do n't want to sleep with you . " She was silent . Then she snorted . " What a strange thing to say . God , you 're funny ! " " I mean , I 'm happy being with you , " I said , hurriedly . " I mean , for now . I mean , do n't get me wrong . I 'm very interested in sex . She was looking out of the front window and smiling at the lights . " That 's very reassuring . " She had an English person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sometime we must try it , " she said . " But it might help if you knew my name . " Her name was Jennifer Jenny ; though she did n't tell me until the next day . It was her way of teasing me and also of making me wait . This time I waited for her , at the swimming pool . She said she swam most days . " Do n't you ? " " I ca n't do it here , " I said . " It gives me the creeps to stand around in my bathing shit while Africans hang on the fence watching . Look at theta .. "  |p336There  were five ragged Africans clinging to the chainlink fence that surrounded the pool , and others lay on the grass , looking in . They were there all day , watching the expatriates in the swimming pool , wearing small tight bathing suits , splashing or sunning themselves . The nakedness fascinated the Africans , and the idea of people lying in the sun was such a novelty that the Africans simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun had the torsion and muscularity of snakes , and like snakes the most they did was blink . I avoided the place usually , though this voyeurism seemed an appropriate African response to whites in Uganda who stared at bare-breasted tribeswomen or Karamojong warriors who never bothered to conceal their thick floppy cocks . " I give African kids swimming lessons , " Jenny said . " I 've taught some of the students to swim . " " I would n't swim here . I 'd hate Africans staring at me . " " That 's just silly . That 's snobbery . " It was our first disagreement . She was intelligent , logical , and articulate ; but I also felt she was wrong . " You probably dislike swimming . " " I used to be a lifeguard . " That night I took her to the Hindoo Lodge . Jenny liked the place  --  vegetarian food served at communal tables . The waiters were Brahmins , though they wore grubby pajamas . I saw my friends Neogy and Desai and I introduced Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . It was the only orthodoxrestaurant in town  --  water in brass jars , a washroom in back , no knives or forks . Jenny made no fuss , though she had a little difficulty managing the rice with her fingers . " Those men are staring at me , " she said . " Because you 're eating with your left hand . " " So what ? " " You 're suppose to eat with your right hand , and make love with your left . " " Tell them I 'm ambidextrous , " she said . After that we often ate out  --  at the Sikh 's , at the Grand Hotel and the Greek 's , at Fatty 's and the Chez Joseph . I introduced her to spending Sunday afternoons strolling at the Botanical Gardensamong milling Indians , and usually we had tea afterwardsp337at the Lake Victoria Hotel . I was very happy , except when Jenny said how much she was looking forward to finishing her diploma course and her posting up-country . She spoke enthusiastically of the isolation of teaching school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even more distant towns like Pakwach and Kitgum and Moroto , haunts of naked cattle rustlers with flopping dongs . I did not want her to go , but I never said so . I said that I might visit her . In the meantime we could spend our time together , if she happened to be free . " I happen to be free , " she said . " I have to visit some listening groups , " I said . " Would you like to come along ? " " What 's a listening group ? " " We used to have tutors all over the country , but the governmentcut our budget . So I organized groups in outlying villages and gave each group a radio . We broadcast lessons to them over Radio Uganda  --  English , political science , African history , whatever . Every few months I visit the groups to see whether any problems have arisen . " " Where do you go ? " " Everywhere . " The morning Jenny and I left Kampala was one of the happiestin my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue sky , going west towards Kabale , past the rivers and the swamps that were choked with feathery papyrus , and the smoky villages that lay under scarred baobab trees , and the plains of Ankole where there were giraffes and gazelles . We stopped in Mbarara for lunch at the little hotel . As we ate , a Land-Rover drew up  --  some tourists and guides in safari clothes , hacking jackets and broadbrimmedhats and big boots ; they were hunters , and very excited to be in this apparent wilderness . After lunch we sped off again towards Kigezi District , where the road twisted around the low hills and volcanoes . I had never traveled these roads with another person . I had always gone alone . It was wonderful to be with this woman . We talked about books we liked . We took turns quoting poetry we had memorized . She recited Wordsworth and T. S. Eliot ; I did Baudelaire and Robert Frost . We chanted " Ozymandias . " We sang folk songs , and when it grew dark in the winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
