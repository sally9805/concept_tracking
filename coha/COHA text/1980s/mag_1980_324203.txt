Bush speaks for them all when he says , " You ca n't escape " <P> Ronald Reagan : " It 's nice to be liked , but it 's more important to be respected . " <P> George Bush : " A President we wo n't have to train . " <P> Howard Baker : " A leader for the ' 80s . " <P> President Carter : " For the truth . " <P> Edward Kennedy : " I think we can make a difference and do it better . " <P> Up and down the Main Streets and Elm Streets of New Hampshire , from Colebrook to Concord , from Dixville Notch to Laconia , banners , posters , TV and radio ads proclaim the slogans aimed at achieving victory or avoiding defeat in the nation 's first primary , on Feb. 26 . The Granite State was a bit upstaged this year when the Iowa and Maine caucuses took on greater prominence than ever before . But New Hampshire is still the first state where voters cast an actual ballot . <P> Adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races in both parties are considered too close to call with any assurance . Carter and Kennedy , Reagan and Bush are battling fiercely for those few extra votes that may be decisive in their campaigns . A victory , however slight , in an early primary gives a candidate momentum going into subsequent contests . Carter clobbered Kennedy 2 to 1 in Iowa , but then won more narrowly last week in Maine , 43.6% to 40.2% , with California Governor Jerry Brown picking up a surprising 13.8% . Bush upset Reagan 32% to 29% in Iowa , though Republican results in Maine will not be known until March 15 . Some 36,000 people participated in the Maine Democratic caucuses , five times the number that turned out in 1976 , and a similar increase is expected in the New Hampshire primary . <P> There is no escaping the political onslaught-the price New Hampshirites pay for wanting to be first . They may be going fishing or to church or to lunch or to nowhere in particular , yet there is usually some candidate or at least some poster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ramada Inn in Manchester , where young workmen were taking down the WELCOME GOVERNOR REAGAN Sign and putting up GREETINGS AMBASSADOR BUSH , one of them groused , " As soon as he 's through , we 've got to get ready for John Anderson . " <P> New Hampshire is sometimes disparaged as being too white , rural and conservative to reflect national opinion , but the state is fast changing . An influx of residents from Massachusetts into the southern part of the state is giving it , for better or worse , the look of much of the rest of the nation : the same kind of suburban sprawl . Its population has been growing faster than that of any other Eastern state except Florida-from 780,000 to 938,000 in the last decade . To reach these greater numbers , candidates are relying more than ever on TV . One pitch follows another in a dizzying succession of 30-second spot commercials . " President Carter-a man of resolve , a man of achievement , " drones one typical effort . Soon after that comes the voice of Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
