Manville , the largest single asbestos producer in the world , filed the bankruptcy petition on Thursday because of what it called the prohibitive cost of contesting over 16 , 000 asbestos-related lawsuits . The effect of the filing is to suspend damage suits pending against the company from claimants who blame it for lung disease and cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. // It also prevents additional suits from being filed until a Federal bankruptcy judge approves the company ' s formal plan for emerging from reorganization proceedings , a procedure that might take years. <> <> 9 Million Workers Exposed // John A. McKinney , the company ' s chairman and chief executive officer , said today at a news conference , " The Government itself needs a bailout from a moral point of view . " Many of the estimated 9 million American workers exposed to asbestos over the past 40 years worked in Government shipyards during World War II , when asbestos was widely used for insulation. // " I expect to emerge from this some system in which the Federal Government pays its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a company consultant , could cost up to $2 billion , almost equivalent to Manville ' s total assets . Of the estimated 16 , 500 suits filed , 90 have gone to trial , and Manville has won 40 percent of them , Mr. McKinney said today . But he added , " It is no pleasure for us in the long run winning a case against a person who is obviously disabled. " // In Washington today , Representaive George Miller , Democrat of California and sponsor of a bill that would require asbestos companies to set up a fund to compensate workers , said that he would hold hearings next month on the Manville situation. // Mr. McKinney , meanwhile , continuing a strong , orchestrated defense of the bankruptcy filing , argued that a reorganization would serve the long-term interests of the company ' s shareholders , employees and creditors. // " Obviously , the shareholders and the creditors are in a difficult position , " he said . " But if we had continued on the way we were going , we ' d have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the New York Stock Exchange today , Manville ' s stock was traded for the first time since the announcement of the bankruptcy action . It fell $2. 75 a share , to close at $5. 125 , as the second most active stock on the exchange . The 35 percent price drop made it the biggest percentage loser. // Mr. McKinney today reiterated earlier company statements that the decision to seek bankruptcy was not a precursor to liquidation , but rather reflected alarm within the company over the financial drain posed by the proliferating claims. // The official said he hoped the filing would contribute to a more workable system for resolving current and future asbestos-related claims. // " The current tort system is a nightmare , and it is unworkable , " he said , adding that some persons who were deserving of compensation had received nothing from the courts , while some who were injured only slightly had won extremely large judgements. // In addition to its legal entanglements with asbestos workers , Manville faces several unresolved issues involving its insurance carriers. // Today in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking for $5 billion in punitive damages from nearly a dozen insurers . <> <> Criticism of Insurers // Manville says that the insurers have failed to meet their obligations to meet claims and that this has forced the company to spend tens of millions of its own funds , damaging its resources and cash flow and ultimately forcing it to file for bankruptcy. // Some insurance carriers have refused to make payments because of a dispute with Manville over the extent of their coverage . In Hartford , Alan R. Fletcher , a spokesman for the Travelers Insurance Cos. , said that while the company had not yet seen the suit , Travelers had been Manville ' s main insurer for 29 years , from 1947 to 1976 . He said that the amount of Manville ' s liability coverage had never been disclosed but that Travelers had paid claimants the total limits of the policy , plus the legal costs of defending Manville. // Mr. McKinney ' s broad public relations strategy since the filing has included a series of full-page newspaper advertisements appearing today that explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and the news conference . He also intends to meet bankers and other creditors to explain Manville ' s decision. // Mr. McKinney spoke to employees at the Manville headquarters 25 miles west of Denver . The building , of sleek glass and aluminum , sits amid rolling Rocky Mountain foothills and great slabs of red limestone where eagles nest . <> <> An Ovation , and Doubts // Mr. McKinney was given an enthusiastic ovation by employees gathered in the sun outside the building , although some did complain that because of the bankruptcy announcement , some banks were refusing to cash payroll checks . The employees were assured that their checks were good , and that banks were required by law to cash them. // A company spokesman said she had been told that Manville expected more legal claims to be filed , that research would still have to be undertaken and , finally , that Manville planned no reductions among its staff of 25 , 000 employees at this time. // Mr. McKinney again emphasized that his company ' s financial condition remained strong , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers or customers . Indeed , since Manville will be forbidden under the terms of the bankruptcy filing to pay any current debts or shareholder dividends , he said it would generate a large amount of cash over the near future. // As a result , Mr. McKinney said , Manville will be able to " pay cash for raw materials . " The decision on the bankruptcy action , the company said , followed a study by a Boston consulting firm , Epidemological Research Inc. , which warned Manville that the company could ultimately face 52 , 000 lawsuits that would cost more than $2 billion. // That study was turned over to the company on Aug. 4 , and reviewed by a committee composed of three of the company ' s outside directors . Last weekend , they recommended to the board at a meeting in New York that Manville file the Chapter 11 petition . The argument was that the costs of litigation could reach a point where the company would be unable to satisfy judgments against it. // Mr. McKinney said that when he went to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the bankruptcy procedure , but was won over . The board of directors voted unanimously in favor of the bankruptcy petition on Wednesday. // If the company had not filed for bankruptcy , he said , Manville would have been forced eventually into a position of " borrowing on secured debt , slowly liquidating and cannibalizing our assets to pay for a system we don ' t believe in.
