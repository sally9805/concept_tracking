She is going to lose her child . She certainly does not want this to happen ; no one does . But it is almost inevitable now . Her son is 5 . He ' ll be 6 in June . She is 43 and can ' t really tell you if she ' s divorced or not . She only knows that the boy ' s father is not at home ; neither is the boy . " He ' s around , " she says about the father . " Does he work ? " she is asked . " He ' s just around . " She has a few medical problems . She is epileptic . She is depressed . She is unemployed , living on a monthly Social Security check of $324 . She has a few psychiatric problems . She has been interviewed more than once by a doctor at Boston Juvenile Court . " They ' re the ones that are crazy , " she says . " Not me . " " What about all the psychiatric appointments at court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They need a psychiatrist . Not me , " she said . The mother seems to be her own worst enemy , and now her problem is one of the law . And it is probably going to cost her the permanent custody of her son . It began with a quarrel , a four-year running feud , she is having with another tenant downstairs . She lives on the third floor ; the man she is constantly fighting lives on the second . The house is a three-decker in Somerville , on a side street off Ball Square . The guy on the second floor says she makes too much noise . She claims the guy won ' t even let her keep a baby carriage in the hallway . The two of them are always going back and forth in court . The landlord just wants to be left alone . Last May , she took her son over to the Kennedy Hospital in Brighton for a checkup . A nurse asked her how she was doing , and the woman indicated that things were getting so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suicide ? " the nurse said . " Suicide , " the woman supposedly told her . " What about your son ? " the nurse asked . " What would happen to him if you committed suicide ? " " I ' d take him with me , " the woman told the nurse . " My son goes with me . " The people at the hospital went into Boston Juvenile Court . They obtained a care and protection petition , and the boy was assigned to a foster home while the mother was supposed to be working out her problems . A social worker from the Davis Square office was assigned to the case . Her name is Phyllis Speciale , and she is very good at the job and cares a lot about the woman . Phyllis Speciale ' s boss in the office is Geralynn Gandolfo . She , too , has spoken with the woman . Both social workers would like to see the mother reunited with her son . Most welfare stories put into print describe how awful the system is when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings treated as index cards , as file folders who get less respect and attention than a paper clip in the office . In this instance , we have a situation where everyone involved - the social workers , the court personnel , the doctors , the judge - all would like to see the normal thing occur : the son goes back home to his natural mother . Everyone seems to be cooperating except the woman , who is now more than a bit leery of dealing with anyone from either welfare or juvenile court . " You won ' t see a psychiatrist ? " she was asked . " No . " " You won ' t go to a mental health clinic ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " They ' ve been trying to keep my son from me , " she said . " They ' re the crazy ones . I ' m fighting for my son . He should be with me . He goes with me . " The law says that the boy will fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks , one year from the day that the care and protection order was issued . Then , under Section 210 of the welfare laws , the paper process will start through the bureaucracy and through the judiciary . " That means one of three things will happen , " Gandolfo was saying . " He could be reintegrated into the home . He could be made eligible for adoption . Or he could be assigned to permanent foster care . " The first option is the ideal one . The last is the one we like to do least . " Yesterday morning , the mother sat in the living room of her apartment . She signed a waiver allowing the people from welfare to discuss her case . She presented all the documents from the courts and doctors that have trailed her through the year . She showed pictures of the boy , who now lives in a foster home in a western suburb . " They take me out there to see him , " she was saying . " I meet him in a park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social worker drives him here . " " To the house ? " " No . " " Where do you see him ? " " I see him at the welfare office , " the mother said . " Then I take him to McDonald ' s . I hug him . And he cries when he has to leave . I ' m with him for about an hour . They won ' t let me alone with him . He can ' t stay overnight . I couldn ' t see him on Christmas . " " Why don ' t you do what the welfare wants and get some counseling ? " she was asked . " You mean a psychiatrist ? " she wanted to know . " I ' m not going to a psychiatrist . I don ' t need one . They need one . They ' re trying to take my son away , and I won ' t let them . " " What can you do ? " " I ' ll get my son back , " the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He belongs with me . He and I are going to be together . "
