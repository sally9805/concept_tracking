The arms transfers to Iran and the activities of the N.S.C. staff in support of the contras are case studies in the perils of policy pursued outside the constraints of orderly process. // The Iran initiative ran directly counter to the Administration ' s own policies on terrorism , the Iran-Iraq war , and military support to Iran . This inconcistency was never resolved , nor were the consequences of this inconsistency fully considered and provided for . The result taken as a whole was a U.S. policy that worked against itself. // The Board believes that failure to deal adequately with these contradictions resulted in large part from the flaws in the manner in which decisions were made . Established procedures for making national security decisions were ignored . Reviews of the initiative by all the N.S.C. principals were too infrequent .

How the initiative was to be carred out never received adequate attention from the N.S.C. principals or a tough working-level review .

The sale of arms to Iran appeared to provide a means to achieve both these objectives . It also played into the hands of those who had other interests - some of them personal financial gain - in engaging the United States in an arms deal with Iran. // In fact , the sale of arms was not equally appropriate for acheiving both these objectives . Arms were what Iran wanted . If all the United States sought was to free the hostages , then an arms-for-hostages deal could achieve the immediate objectives of both sides . But if the U.S. objective was a broader strategic relationship , then the sale of arms should have been contingent upon first putting into place the elements of that relationship . An arms-for-hostages deal in this context could become counter-productive to achieving this broader strategic objectives .

The Reagan Administration in particular had come into office declaring a firm stand against terrorism , which it continued to maintain . In December of 1985 , the Administration completed a major study under the chairmanship of the Vice President . It resulted in a vigorous reaffirmation of U.S. opposition to terrorism in all its forms and a vow of total war on terrorism whatever its source . The Administration continued to pressure U.S. allies not to sell arms to Iran and not to make concessions to terrorists. // No serious effort was made to reconcile the inconsistency between thse policies and the Iran initiative .

This threatened to upser the military balance between Iran and Iraq , with consequent jeopardy to the Gulf States and the interests of the West in that region . The arms-for-hostages trades rewarded a regime that clearly supported terrorism and hostage-taking . They increased the risks that the United States would be perceived , especially in the Arab world , as a creature of Israel . They suggested to other U.S. allies and friends in the region that the United States had shifted its policy in favor of Iran .

Implementation Was Unprofessional. // The manner in which the Iran initiative was implemented and LtCol North undertook to support the contras are very similar .

LtCol North made most of the significant operational decisions . He conducted the operation through Mr. Secord and his associates , a network of private individuals already involved in the contra resupply operation . To this was added a handful of selected individuals from the C.I.A. // But the C.I.A. support was limited . Two C.I.A. officials , though often at meetings , had a relatively limited role . One served as the point man for LtCol North in providing logistics and financial arrangements . The other ( Mr. Allen ) served as a contact between LtCol North and the intelligence community . By contrast , George Cave actually played a significant and expanding role . However , Clair George , Deputy Director for Operations , at C.I.A. , told the Board : " George was paid by me and on the paper was working for me .

He relied instead on a number of private intermediares , businessmen and other financial brokers , private operators , and Iranians hostile to the United States . Some of these were individuals with questionable credentials and potentially large personal financial interests in the transactions . This made the transactions unnecessarily complicated and invited kickbacks and payoffs . This arrangement also dramatically increased the risks that the intiatve would leak . Yet no provision was made for such an eventuality . Further , the use of Mr. Secord ' s private network in the Iran initiative linked those operators with the resupply of the contras , threatening exposure of both operations if either became public. // The result was a very unprofessional operation. <> <> * * * // The implementation of the initiative was never subjected to a rigorous review .

Here too , selected C.I.A. officials reported directly to LtCol North .

After all , this system was created to serve the President of the United States in ways of his choosing . By his actions , by his leadership , the President therefore determines the quality of its performance. // By his own account , as evidenced in his diary notes , and as conveyed to the Board by his principal advisors , President Reagan was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages . It was this intense compassion for the hostages that appeared to motivate his steadfast support of the Iran initiative , even in the face of opposition from his Secretaries of State and Defense. // In his obvious commitment , the President appears to have proceeded with a concept of the initiative that was not accurately reflected in the reality of the operation . The President did not seem to be aware of the way in which the operation was implemented and the full consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of both the hostages and the Iranians who could have been at risk may have been conveyed in a manner so as to inhibit the full functioning of the system. // The President ' s management style is to put the principal responsibility for policy review and implementation on the shoulders of his advisors . Nevertheless , with such a complex , high-risk operation and so much at stake , the President should have insured that the N.S.C. system did not fail him . He did not force his policy to undergo the most critical review of which the N.S.C. participants and the process were capable . At no time did he insist upon accountability and performance review . Had the President chosen to drive the N.S.C. system , the outcome could well have been different . As it was , the most powerful features of the N.S.C. system - providing comprehensive analysis , alternatives and follow-up - were not utilized. // The Board found a strong consensus among N.S.C. participants that the President ' s priority in the Iran initiative was the release of U.S. hostages . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risky initiatives that directly affect U.S. national security . He must ensure that the content and tactics of an initiative match his priorities and objectives . He must insist upon accountability . For it is the President who must take responsibility for the N.S.C. system and deal with the consequences. // Beyond the President , the other N.S.C. principals and the national security adviser must share in the responsibility for the N.S.C. system. // President Reagan ' s personal management style places an especially heavy responsibility on his key advisors . Knowing his style , they should have been particularly mindful of the need for special attention to the manner in which this arms-sale initiative developed and proceeded . On this score , neither the national security adviser nor the other N.S.C. principals deserve high marks. // It is their obligation as members and advisors to the council to ensure that the President is adequately served . The principal subordinates to the President must not be deterred from urging the President not to proceed on a highly questionable course of action even in the face of his strong conviction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the N.S.C. process did not fail , it simply was largely ignored . The national security adviser and the N.S.C. principals all had a duty to raise the issue and insist that orderly process be imposed . None of them did so. // All had the opportunity . While the national security adviser had the responsibility to see that an orderly process was observed , his failure to do so does not excuse the other N.S.C. principals . It does not appear that any of the N.S.C. principals called for more frequent consideration of the Iran initiative by the N.S.C. principals in the presence of the President . None of the principals called for a serious vetting of the initiative by even a restricted group of disinterested individuals . The intelligence questions do not appear to have been raised , and legal considerations , while raised , were not pressed . No one seemed to have complained about the informality of the process . No one called for a thorough re-examination once the initiative did not meet expectations or the manner of execution changed . While one or another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously pursued the issue. // Mr. Regan also shares in this responsibility . More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory , he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser . He was personally active in national security affairs and attended almost all the relevant meetings regarding the Iran initiative . He , as much as anyone , should have insisted that an orderly process be observed . In addition , he especially should have ensured that plans were made for handling any public disclosure of the initiative . He must bear primary responsibility for the chaos that descended upon the White House when such disclosure did occur. // Mr. McFarlane appeared caught between a President who supported the initiative and the Cabinet officers who strongly opposed it . While he made efforts to keep these Cabinet officers informed , the board heard complaints from some that he was not always successful . VADM Poindexter on several occasions apparently sought to exclude N.S.C. principals other than the President from knowledge of the initiative . Indeed , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misled by VADM Poindexter. // VADM Poindexter also failed grievously on the matter of contra diversion . Evidence indicates that VADM Poindexter knew that a diversion occurred , yet he did not take the steps that were required given the gravity of that prospect . He apparently failed to appreciate or ignored the serious legal and political risks presented . His clear obligation was either to investigate the matter or take it to the President - or both . He did neither . Director Casey shared a similar responsibility . Evidence suggests that he received information about the possible diversion of funds to the contras almost a month before the story broke . He , too , did not move promptly to raise the matter with the President . Yet his responsibility to do so was clear. // The N.S.C. principals other than the President may be somewhat excused by the insufficient attention on the part of the national security adviser to the need to keep all the principals fully informed . Given the importance of the issue and the sharp policy divergences involved , however , Secretary Shultz and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secretary Shultz specifically requested to be informed only as necessary to perform his job . Secretary Weinberger had access through intelligence to details about the operation . Their obligation was to give the President their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or , if they could not in conscience do that , to so inform the President . Instead , they simply distanced themselves from the program . They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue . They were not energetic in attempting to protect the President from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages. // Director Casey appears to have been informed in considerable detail about the specifics of the Iranian operation . He appears to have acquiesced in and to have encouraged North ' s exercise of direct operational control over the operation . Because of the N.S.C. staff ' s proximity to and close identification with the President , this increased the risks to the President if the initiative became public or the operation failed. // There is no evidence , however , that Director Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President that LtCol North , rather than the C.I.A. , was running the operation . The President does not recall ever being informed of this fact . Indeed , Director Casey should have gone further and pressed for operational responsibility to be transferred to the C.I.A.. // Director Casey should have taken the lead in vetting the assumptions presented by the Israelis on which the program was based and in pressing for an early examination of the reliance upon Mr. Ghorbanifar and the second channel as intermediaries . He should also have assumed responsibility for checking out the other intermediaries involved in the operation . Finally , because Congressional restrictions on covert actions are both largely directed at and familiar to the C.I.A. , Director Casey should have taken the lead in keeping the question of Congressional notification active. <> <> // Finally , Director Casey , and , to a lesser extent , Secretary Weinberger should have taken it upon themselves to assess the effect of the transfer of arms and intelligence to Iran on the Iran-Iraq military balance , and to transmit that information to the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissaries from the Government of Israel took place prior to the commencement of the initiative . It remains unclear whether the initial proposal to open the Ghorbanifar channel was an Israeli initiative , was brought on by the avarice of arms dealers , or came as a result of an American request for assistance . There is no doubt , however , that it was Israel that pressed Mr. Ghorbanifar on the United States . U.S. officials accepted Israeli assurances that they had had for some time an extensive dialogue that involved high-level Iranians , as well as their assurances of Mr. Ghorbanifar ' s bona fides . Thereafter , at critical points in the initiative , when doubts were expressed by critical U.S. participants , an Israeli emissary would arrive with encouragement , often a specific proposal , and pressure to stay with the Ghorbanifar channel. // From the record available to the board , it is not possible to determine the role of key U.S. participants in prompting these Israeli interventions . There were active and ongoing consultations between LtCol North and officials of the Israeli Government , specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwimmer , Mr. Nimrodi , and Mr. Ledeen , also in frequent contact with LtCol North , had close ties with the Government of Israel . It may be that the Israeli interventions were actively solicited by particular U.S. officials . Without the benefit of the views of the Israeli officials involved , it is hard to know the facts. // It is clear , however , that Israel had its own interests , some in direct conflict with those of the United States , in having the United States pursue the initiative . For this reason , it had an incentive to keep the initiative alive . It sought to do this by interventions with the N.S.C. staff , the national security adviser and the President . Although it may have received suggestions from LtCol North , Mr. Ledeen and others , it responded affirmatively to these suggestions by reason of its own interests. // Even if the Government of Israel actively worked to begin the initiative and to keep it going , the U.S. Government is responsible for its own decisions . Key participants in U.S. deliberations made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative were different from , and in some respects in conflict with , those of the United States . Although Israel dealt with those portions of the U.S. Government that it deemed were sympathetic to the initiative , there is nothing improper per se about this fact . U.S. decision-makers made their own decisions and must bear responsibility for the consequences . <> <> AFTERMATH - THE EFFORTS TO TELL THE STORY // From the first hint in late October 1986 that the McFarlane trip would soon become public , information on the Iran initiative and contra activity cascaded into the press . The veiled hints of secret activities , random and indiscriminate disclosures of information from a variety of sources , both knowledgeable and otherwise , and conflicting statements by high-level officials presented a confusing picture to the American public . The board recognized that conflicts among contemporaneous documents and statements raised concern about the management of the public presentation of facts on the Iran initiative . Though the board reviewed some evidence on events after the exposure , our ability to comment on these events remains limited. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President wanted to avoid providing too much specificity or detail out of concern for the hostages still held in Lebanon and those Iranians who had supported the initiative . In doing so , he did not , we believe , intend to mislead the American public or cover up unlawful conduct . By at least Nov. 20 , the President took steps to insure that all the facts would come out . From the President ' s request to Mr. Meese to look into the history of the initiative , to his appointment of this board , to his request for an independent counsel , to his willingness to discuss this matter fully and to review his personal notes with us , the board is convinced that the President does indeed want the full story to be told. // Those who prepared the President ' s supporting documentation did not appear , at least initially , to share in the President ' s ultimate wishes . Mr. McFarlane described for the board the process used by the N.S.C. staff to create a chronology that obscured essential facts . Mr. McFarlane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , present " a full and completely accurate account " of the events and left ambiguous the President ' s role . This was , according to Mr. McFarlane , done to distance the President from the timing and nature of the President ' s authorization . He told the board that he wrote a memorandum on Nov. 18 , which tried to , in his own words , " gild the President ' s motives . " This version was incorporated into the chronology . Mr. McFarlane told the board that he knew the account was " misleading , at least , and wrong , at worst . " Mr. McFarlane told the board that he did provide the Attorney General an accurate account of the President ' s role. // The board found considerable reason to question the actions of LtCol North in the aftermath of the disclosure . The board has no evidence to either confirm or refute that LtCol North destroyed documents on the initiative in an effort to conceal facts from threatened investigations . The board found indications that LtCol North was involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withhold important information . The files of LtCol North contained much of the historical documentation that the board used to construct its narrative . Moreover , LtCol North was the primary U.S. Government official involved in the details of the operation . The chronology he produced has many inaccuracies . These " histories " were to be the basis of the " full " story of the Iran initiative . These inaccuracies lend some evidence to the proposition that LtCol North , either on his own or at the behest of others , actively sought to conceal important information. // Out of concern for the protection of classified material , Director Casey and VADM Poindexter were to brief only the Congressional intelligence committees on the " full " story ; the D.C.I. before the committees and VADM Poindexter in private sessions with the chairmen and vice chairmen . The D.C.I. and VADM Poindexter undertook to do this on November 21 , 1986 . It appears from the copy of the D.C.I. ' s testimony and notes of VADM Poindexter ' s meetings that they did not fully relate the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandable perception that they were not forthcoming. // The board is also concerned about various notes that appear to be missing . VADM Poindexter was the official note taker in some key meetings , yet no notes for the meetings can be found . The reason for the lack of such notes remains unknown to the board . If they were written , they may contain very important information . We have no way of knowing if they exist. //
