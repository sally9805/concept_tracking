The problem , United States law-enforcement officials along the border say , is that cooperation from the Government of Mexico ranges from incomplete to nonexistent . The reasons run from what one Mexican memo acknowledged was entrenched corruption to the political factors that make Mexicans reluctant to appear too helpful to the United States . And underlying all of this is Mexico ' s deteriorating economic situation . Unless that improves , American officials say they are pessimistic that cooperation will improve any time soon. // In the recent project , more than 250 Mexican and United States police officers , working on both sides of the border for eight weeks , arrested 3 , 506 fugitives on charges including drug trafficking , smuggling of illegal aliens and murder. // // It Was Not as It Seemed // At a news conference when the operation ended , Stanley E. Morris , director of the United States Marshals Service , called the project a great success and " a valuable beginning. " // Privately , however , many law-enforcement officers were not so pleased . " From an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior American official who had been directly involved . The reason for his scorn was clear : Of the 3 , 506 fugitives , 3 , 503 were arrested in the United States ; 3 in Mexico. // One possible reason for the disparity was given in a confidential marshals ' document recounting a conversation with Jose Maria Ortega , the Mexican deputy attorney general , who had directed the Mexican part of the program . Before the operation began , American officials asked Mr. Ortega to evaluate his force , the Federal Judicial Police . According to the document , he divided them into three groups . <> <> Perhaps New Recruits // The first group , Mr. Ortega told American officials , was " totally corrupt and therefore not reliable , " the report said . The second was " contemplating corrupt acts " while those in the third group were " newly recruited and therefore not experienced. " // Howard Safir , the director of operations for the Marshals Service , said he was not familiar with the document , although he did say Mr. Ortega was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrests in Mexico , Mr. Safir said : " It was a start . We didn ' t expect big numbers to begin with. " // In interviews , numerous American law authorities in Washington and along the border said they shared Mr. Safir ' s view . When it comes to official cooperation from Mexico on drug trafficking , illegal immigration , border violence and related issues , most simply do not expect very much. // " Occasionally we ' re given some little crumb , " said Alan Eliason , United States Border Patrol chief in San Diego . <> <> President Speaks of Efforts // But in a televised interview last week , President Miguel de la Madrid said Mexico " is devoting a large part of its budget to the fight against drugs ; it has assigned a large part of its army to the campaign , and the facts show that Mexico has been an active fighter against international drug trafficking. " // On illegal immigration , he said increased American law enforcement would not work , adding : " If there were no demand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go to the United States . " Early this month Mexico ' s foreign minister , Bernardo Sepulveda Amor , urged American authorities to stop " harassing " illegal aliens. // As a result of views like Mr. Sepulveda ' s , American officials say , the United States has come to view even the smallest cooperative effort as a breakthrough . And that helps explain contradictory public statements from Reagan Administration officials recently about relations with Mexico. // Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez of Mexico have been meeting over several months to foster greater law-enforcement cooperation . The fourth meeting was held in Cancun , Mexico , in April , and out of them came several agreements for joint initiatives . <> <> ' It Was a Start , ' Aide Says // As a result , a State Department official said : " They began giving us slight , occasional help on some things . It was a start. " // The recent drive for arrests was one example . Another involved the tracing of United States-made firearms. // For years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms serial numbers and other data on American-made weapons they seize . The firearms bureau uses this to find out where the weapons were purchased and in some cases to prosecute American dealers suspected of smuggling. // The Mexicans seldom responded , even though putting those dealers out of business " benefits Mexico , too , " Stephen E. Higgins , director of the firearms bureau , said. // Unlike most other countries in the region , Mexico declined to cooperate for the most part , without explaining why . In 1984 , as an example , the Dominican Republic made 1 , 070 trace requests , while Mexico made 184 . <> <> List of 800 Is Turned Over // Then , as a result of the meetings this spring of attorneys general , Mexico turned over a list of 800 weapons the police had seized , asking the United States to trace their origins. // " It was their first big request , " Mr. Higgins said . But it was still " only a tiny percentage of those they have seized. " // To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 were traceable , " Mr. Higgins said . For the others , " the information was incomplete or bad or the weapons were too old , " some seized as long as 20 years ago . Still , he added , even that list " was a start. " // Meanwhile , others in Government became frustrated that the level of cooperation was improving so slowly while problems on the border were rising so dramatically. // Last month , testifying before a Senate subcommittee , William von Raab , the Commissioner of Customs , called problems at the border " a horror story " and faulted Mexico as failing " to provide us with information , intelligence and cooperation that would enable us to mount an effective border campaign . " Without Mexican help , Mr. von Raab said , law enforcement along the border " is doomed . " <> <> ' Corrupted by Vast Sums ' // Elliott Abrams , an assistant Secretary of State , was unusually critical , too , saying numerous Mexican officials , including many " supposedly engaged in antinarcotics efforts , " have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to traffickers. " // The Mexican Government sent an official note of protest . In a few days Mr. Meese apologized to Mr. Garcia Ramirez , in effect recanting the Abrams statement . That angered and confused others in the Administration and in Congress. // A Justice Department official explained : " Things with Mexico are far from perfect , but we had made a start when we ' d had almost nothing going with them before . Meese thought the Mexico-bashing was undercutting us. " // Meanwhile , in Washington and along the border , many law-enforcement officers say Mexican authorities still offer little cooperation , although there are exceptions. // Silvestre Reyes , chief of the Border Patrol in South Texas , recalled a recent incident when his office called the local Mexican police for help in arresting smugglers who were discovered ferrying three tons of marijuana across the Rio Grande to Mercedes , Tex . " They were on the scene in less than five minutes , " Mr. Reyes said . <> <> ' They Could Be Doing More ' // Still , on the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service , said , " They certainly could be doing more. " // Corruption remains a major problem , American officials say . Paying small bribes to public officials in exchange for favors or services is a Mexican tradition . But recently , American officials say , the Mexican economy has deteriorated so drastically that the system has grown into a problem of vast corruption involving even some senior members of the government . Last month , Mr. Abrams said corruption had become so pervasive that it threatened to undermine the Government ' s authority. // Law officers say they feel the effect along the border . " The way the atmosphere is in Mexico today , " said Richard Slattery , assistant agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration ' s San Diego office , there is no way the Mexican Federal security police force can arrest major drug traffickers because the traffickers know too much about the police force ' s involvement in trafficking. #700 Were Dismissed in a Year Recognizing that , the Mexican Government dismissed " more than 700 " federal police officers last year " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raab said. // A few weeks ago , according to officials with the D.E.A. , the Customs Service and the Border Patrol , several officers of this service armed with machine guns were escorting a tanker truck filled with marijuana as it traveled north on Mexico ' s Highway 101 toward El Paso. // That is not unusual , said William R. Logan , regional commissioner of Customs in Houston . The United States often gets reports of " convoys of vehicles " loaded with drugs " coming up from the interior and escorted into the border areas " by Mexican Judicial Police or the Mexican federal police , he said. // In the recent case , Mr. Reyes of the Texas Border Patrol said , " local police stopped them in the town of San Fernando , " 85 miles south of El Paso . A machine-gun battle followed . <> <> Officers Reportedly Fled // D ' Wayne Jernigan , head of the Customs Service office in McAllen , Tex. , said the Mexican federal police officers shot and killed five of the local policemen , then apparently fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck . The Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed the account. // Sometimes these armed police convoys do not stop at the border , officials say. // " There has been a series of instances in recent months , " Mr. Logan said , when uniformed Mexican federal police officers carrying automatic weapons have escorted drug traffickers with loads of marijuana or cocaine across the Rio Grande. // The first reports came last fall from an organization of Federal border agents , active and retired , in south Texas . In a letter to President Reagan , the group charged that Mexican federal police officers " armed with machine guns and wearing . 45-caliber pistols provided an armed escort " and then " set up a perimeter defense " while the traffickers delivered a load of marijuana and cocaine in Starr County in Texas , just west of McAllen . <> <> Informant Termed Reliable // In McAllen , Mr. Jernigan said that report came from " an informant who has been a longtime , reliable source in Starr County . " " He doesn ' t give information very often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always corroborated. " // To counteract such problems , sometimes United States authorities on the border use unorthodox methods . United States drug-enforcement officials acknowledge that in January they hired several off-duty Mexican police officers to seize Rene Verdugo , a reputed Mexican drug trafficker , in Baja California and in effect , to kidnap him . He was wanted for questioning in the murder of Enrique Camerana , a United States Drug Enforcement Administration officer slain in Mexico last year. // The off-duty Mexican officers blindfolded Mr. Verdugo and carried him to the border , according to a law officer with direct knowledge of the incident , where they " shoved him through the fence , " at Calexico , southeast of San Diego . There he was arrested by the Border Patrol . Since then he has been testifying before a Federal grand jury . <> <> Cost Is About Same , He Says // " We paid the Mexicans about $50 , 000 , what we normally pay for bringing in a fugitive , " the official added . " With things the way they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise. " // American officials say corruption is only part of the problem . In addition , Mexican officials are reluctant to seem overtly helpful , particularly on the issue of illegal immigration , for fear of political damage at home. // Access to the United States employment market is a political and economic " safety valve for Mexico , and obviously they are satisfied with that , " said Mr. Nelson . As a result , said Mr. Eliason , chief of the border patrol in San Diego , " Mexican law enforcement just can ' t be seen doing much to help. " // With Mexico ' s economy continuing to deteriorate and relations between the two countries tense , Mr. Eliason said , Mexican authorities " have very little incentive to help us now. " // If , as expected , Mexico ' s economic troubles continue to grow , he added , " they will probably have even less. " //
