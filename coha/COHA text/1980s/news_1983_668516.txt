You heard the words when you were a mere child and your father heard the words when he was a child and his father heard the words when he was a child . They are words grown familiar and empty with overuse - the dreary metronome of Red Sox baseball - and so it was that you just sensed what Ralph Houk ' s first words would be on this fine , ripe Sunday afternoon in July . And , yet , you felt nothing . " Hurst deserved to win the ballgame . . . he deserved to win it . Like I said , Hurst pitched well . " The Red Sox yesterday lost another game they should have won . The Cape is crowded in summer and the Red Sox lose games like this in summer . . . both routes have been well-traveled for a long , long time . So merely insert the names of any number of past unfortunates in place of Bruce Hurst ' s and you have the neatest of synopses of Red Sox baseball since all of us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . If the truism of sports is that good teams make things happen , then the opposite is that Red Sox have usually waited for bad things to happen to them . So it was yesterday , the day the seventh-inning wretch did them in . " You know what the Red Sox did in that inning ? " asked California second baseman Bobby Grich . " They went by the book . . . they did everything they were supposed to do . But sometimes you can ' t go by the book ; sometimes , you ' ve got to got to go with your gut . " Nothing big happened in that seventh inning . Reggie didn ' t hit one atop the Pru , Rick Burleson didn ' t clear the bases with a tweener into The Triangle and Rod Carew didn ' t steal home . Somehow , you could have accepted all of thosebecause they are major league plays made by major leaguers . Instead , the Red Sox were nibbled alive by a swarm of little plays - one after another the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eaten alive . As usual . " Oh , Lord , " you murmur to yourself , " just give me a Red Sox team that can make the little plays and I will gladly give you the last 76,000 homers over The Wall . Even up . . . no questions asked . " The Angels , trailing , 3-1 , had two on and none out in that wretched seventh when the first little demon pranced onto the field . Bobby Clark bounced a not-so-hard grounder toward Jerry Remy at second and the ball arrived a fraction before Grich , the baserunner at first , passed in front of Remy . Grich saw all kinds of bad things happening to this potential big inning ; either Remy would tag him and then throw to first for the DP or else he would stop in the basepath before Remy tagged him but Remy could then throw to first and Dave Stapleton would have time to get Grich at second . " I was expecting Remy to tag me , " said Grich , also a second baseman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make right at that moment . . . Who ' s the runner ? How many outs ? What ' s the score ? Was the ball hit hard enough to go to second and get the DP that way ? All kind of variables go into it , but I do remember thinking that Jerry was probably going to go after me with the tag . " Remy , instead , went for the force double play and threw the ball to shortstop Glenn Hoffman . Hoffman ' s relay was a tad late at first and the Angels had runners on first and third with one out . Next came the second little monster , Tim Foli ' s spinning trickler down the third-base line toward Eddie Jurak . " Was it spinning toward the line ? " Houk asked the writers . " We couldn ' t tell if it was going foul . . . ( Jurak ) had no play on it . " No one ever will know whether the spinner would have gone foul if Jurak had left it alone , but virtually everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe at first . One run in , one out , Foli on first and Clark , the tying run , on second . The third little demon was dressed in full regalia with horns , pitchfork and red tights . Unfortunately , his Sox were also very Red because this time Bob Boone grounded to Jurak and a most remarkable scene - seemingly in slow motion - unfolded in the basepath between second and third . Jurak , the ball and Clark could have kissed and made up all kinds of tall tales . . . they were that close that long . " I was right there next to him and I thought he was going to tag me , " said Clark . " But then it looked like he was trying to throw to second and I was trying to get out of his way and he was trying to get out of my way ; we both tried to get out of each other ' s way . Then he seemed to have trouble getting the ball out of his glove . That ' s when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . I mean , I was right on top of him . " Instant quiz for Boston fans : What happened when the Red Sox of 1923 , 1933 , 1943 , 1953 , 1963 , 1973 and 1983 laid out the red carpet and just gave the tying run for the bad guys a free ride to third base ? ( a ) Passed ball ; ( b ) cheap hit ; ( c ) many runs ; ( d ) all of the above . The first pitch from Bob Stanley skipped off Gary Allenson ' s glove for a passed ball and Clark scored the tying run ; Rick Burleson dinked " a lucky hit " into right center , scoring Foli , and Reggie Jackson dunked a blooper over third for the fourth and final run of the inning . The Angels led , 5-3 ; the game was over . Oh , Lord , one final proposition . Would you take a rooftop box and all 3000 of the Red Sox blowout wins over the last 80 years for one team that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one daring , aggressive , smart team ? We ' d give anything . . . even our souls .
