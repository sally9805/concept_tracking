txt // oppression and humiliation manifested themselves , and were answered by Jewish adaptation . Arendt is hostile to the two main Jewish responses : assimilation ( the response of the parvenu ) and reclusive existence ( the response of the pariah ) . Both responses tended to aggravate antisemitism . Arendt is especially attentive to the psychology of the parvenu , the Jew who will accept acceptance on any terms , provided that acceptance permits entry to the most fashionable circles . Her model is Disraeli , on whom she expends some of her most acute analytic ability . But the story of the usual parvenu is more distressing than that of the brilliant Disraeli . Arendt examines the nature of the social acceptance that awaited the aspirant Jew ( the upstart ) , and finds that the Jew fascinated the upper classes as an embodiment of vice . For society at large , the Jew was a criminal , a traitor , and unreliable because of double loyalties . The upper classes transmuted " crime " into vice and found in acquaintance with " vice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acceptance on these terms was that the Jew became all the more strange in the eyes of ordinary people . Arendt says : Social " philosemitism " always ended by adding to political antisemitism that mysterious fanaticism without which antisemitism could hardly have become the best slogan for organizing the masses . All the declasses of capitalist society were finally ready to unite and establish mob organizations of their own ; their propaganda and their attraction rested on the assumption that a society which had shown its willingness to incorporate crime in the form of vice into its very structure would by now be ready to cleanse itself of viciousness by openly admitting criminals and by publicly committing crimes . ' In an essay first published in German in 1948 , before The Origins of Totalitarianism , and titled " Die Verborgene Tradition , " Arendt sketches the few responses she does admire : Realizing only too well that they did not enjoy political freedom nor full admission to the life of nations , but that , instead , they had been separated from their own people and lost contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men yet achieved liberty and popularity by the sheer force of imagination . As individuals they started an emancipation of their own , of their own hearts and brains . ' The heroes are Heinrich Heine ( voice of the innocent , the schlemihl ) ; Bernard Lazare ( the conscious pariah ) ; Charlie Chaplin ( the archetypal suspect ) ; and Franz Kafka ( poet of the fate of the man of good will ) .1 ' The only politically relevant response in this grouping was that of Lazare , who courageously agitated the Jewish issue in France . He rebelled as a Jew in behalf of Jewish rights and sought acceptance as a Jew . He thus rejected both assimilation on the terms of non Jews and a reclusive and civilly dead existence . Lazare was the conscious pariah : He would not accept acceptance except on his own terms , and he fought politically to secure those terms . His very commitment earned him the respect of professional antisemites . Arendt 's implicit point is that concerted political resistance at the right time could have diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accepted increased it . Antisemitism is thus a heterogeneous phenomenon ; modern antisemitism is // bound to the changing relation of Jews to the modern state , the changing relations between the state and the rest of society , the spread of Jewish emancipation , and the efforts at assimilation . Arendt also takes specific historical circumstances into account , including financial scandals and disasters with which Jews had some close involvement . She is painstaking in her effort to make modern antisemitism in Europe an intelligible social and political tendency . The method of intelligibility is the attempt to think the thoughts of antisemites , to study and half imagine the ways in which they saw and felt the world . We do not leave Arendt 's writing with added sympathy , but rather with a sense of the mottled humanity of antisemite and Jew alike . Arendt achieves the effect of an impartiality that has overcome pain and aversion . ON RACISM IN AFRICA Unlike her exploration of antisemitism , Arendt 's treatment of European antiblack racism is perforce a reconstruction of experience that she did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impart the inwardness of white reaction to black natives . She relies in part on literary evidence , especially Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness . In fact she does not supply much evidence of any kind . One mentions these facts because Arendt 's analysis is upsetting to an unusual degree . Mentioning her remoteness from the scene is not an honest way of expressing one 's own doubts about what she says , and one 's hopes that the situation was not as she says it was . What she says does not have the effect ofjustifying racist exploitation , not even the effect of raising a little human sympathy for the Europeans . Nevertheless , there is an indigestible quality to Arendt 's analysis , to her act of generosity toward the Boers , Germans , Belgians , and other European exploiters and imperialists . What differentiates her treatment of antiblack racism from her treatment of nineteenth-century antisemitism is that the former was accompanied by atrocities on an inconceivable scale , as she herself mentions , while the latter only made possible such atrocities . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocities as there was between European antisemitism and Nazi genocide . The appalling fact is that any effort to render the inwardness of those who engaged in the slaughter , enslavement , or other systematic exploitation of millions of people must appear callous at the least . But Arendt is willing to risk any appearance for the sake of truth . Nowhere in her work does she take more chances ? is at greater risk ? than in her discussion of European antiblack racism in Africa . ( She once said , in conversation , before the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem that she received more hostile response to her essay opposing school desegregation , " Reflections on Little Rock , " than to any other piece she had ever done . But that essay is undramatic in comparison to the pages on antiblack racism in The Origins of Totalitarianism . ) Arendt is clear that " racism is the main ideological weapon of imperialistic politics . " 18 The doctrine of racial inferiority was deliberately used to justify policies initially prompted by other considerations . Arendt follows Hobson // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigated by economic pressures . The wish to find a profitable place for the investment of surplus or " superfluous " capital was basic . Joined to this was the desire to find a place to settle for " superfluous " people , the unemployed and the discontented . The stress in Arendt 's analysis is on the illimitable nature of late nineteenth-century European capitalism : profits for profits ' sake , expansion for expansion 's sake , the fevered wish to be forced by the logic of economic conditions to keep constantly in motion , constantly pushing outward , never prepared to draw the line and say enough . She quotes Cecil Rhodes 's remark , " I would annex the planets if I could , " as emblematic . She sees imperialism as politics denatured into pure power , as politics corrupted by the newly potent bourgeoisie . But such ferocious energy needed a justification , an ideology , and it found it in racism . The pity is that racism had a foundation in fact . Arendt claims that the first contacts between whites and blacks in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a developed racist ideology , which in turn helped to strengthen the imperialist urge by covering it with the semblance of thought . What were these contacts like ? Arendt says : Race was the emergency explanation of human beings whom no European or civilized man could understand and whose humanity so frightened and humiliated the immigrants that they no longer cared to belong to the same human species . Race was the Boers ' answer to the overwhelming monstrosity of Africa ? a whole continent populated and overpopulated by savages ? an explanation of the madness which grasped and illuminated them like " a flash of lightning in a serene sky : Exterminate all the brutes . " ' 19 In what lay the capacity to disgust and madden the Europeans ? What made them different from other human beings was not at all the color of their skin but the fact that they behaved like a part of nature , that they treated nature as their undisputed master , that they had not created a human world , a human reality , and that therefore nature had remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? compared to which they appeared to be phantoms , unreal and ghost-like . They were , as it were , " natural " human beings who lacked the specifically human character , the specifically human reality , so that when European men massacred them they somehow were not aware that they had committed murder.20 What Arendt does not say is that the Europeans would have needed some imagination to see the " savages " as human , as equally human to themselves ; but there was no incentive to let one 's imagination of otherness work . Profit and conquest rested on a complete effacement of this kind of imagination . Arendt oddly excludes the intoxicant role of self-interest in these passages where she tries to view the world as the Boers and others did , even though she is so insistent on the underlying connection between capitalism and imperialism . How can one be sure in matters like this ? It seems that Arendt is too generous in her attempt to make sense of incalculably evil behavior . She perhaps gives too much of herself . In The Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lets himself imitate the rest of nature too well , or // when he lets his whole life be spent in the exercise of natural " metabolic " functions . We find that she attributes nearly identical sentiments to the Europeans in Africa . The urgency in her writing drives her close to an identification with the Europeans . Yet she may be right . The warrant for saying that is the disgust with which she treats the Boers . If she can imagine their feelings when they first saw the blacks , she is also unremitting in describing the Boers ' cruelty and their own degeneration into a merely natural , though completely exploitative existence . She shows nothing but a horrified disapproval of the other Europeans and their deeds as well . It is as if Arendt believes that unless inquirers went to the limits of their imaginative powers , inquiry must fail . Some of the worst criminals in human history must be included too , within the grasp of the empathetic imagination . Yet empathy is not to be accorded to the Nazis , because to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELITE Arendt enlarges our understanding of the distasteful , even the abhorrent . She also enlarges our understanding of the disreputable and engages our sympathy while doing so . In dealing with the main example of this latter effect , we deal with a group to whom totalitarian movements were immensely attractive and who had their roots in the imperialist period and even earlier . But because they did not retain their fascination with totalitarianism once the movement came to power , they were properly part of the Europe that made totalitarianism possible rather than part of totalitarianism itself . As such , they receive Arendt 's generosity of understanding . They strain generosity greatly , without making its exercise quite as risky as the antisemites and antiblacks do . This group is the " elite , " the intellectuals who from roughly the latter part of the nineteenth century mounted a campaign of spiritual subversion against the dominant opinions and beliefs of bourgeois Europe . Arendt is interested particularly in " the front generation , " those who fought in the Great War and came back permanently altered , permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarian movements ( and by implication all extremist movements ) answered to a terrific need to see the bourgeois order shaken up , ridiculed , exposed in its real nature . This need led to what Arendt calls " the temporary alliance between the mob and the elite . " ( The mob is the aggregation from which the leaders of extremist and totalitarian movements came . ) Arendt acknowledges that the pleasure that intellectuals took in extremism is " more disturbing to our peace of mind than the unconditional loyalty of members of totalitarian movements , and the popular support of totalitarian regimes . " 21 But she will not call this pleasure " nihilist " if by using that epithet one thinks one has disposed of the matter . The epithet may finally capture the tonality of the elite 's attitude , yet there was nothing gratuitous , nothing inexplicable about their readiness to see everything go under . Throughout the book Arendt does not hide her own severity toward bourgeois culture . In making the mentality of the elite accessible to her putatively skeptical or hostile readers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of life she shares . She and the elite look on bourgeois culture with revulsion , but her response is energized by a love of politics and a regard for the integrity of the publicness and impartiality of the state . The European bourgeoisie killed these principles . Most of the elite , contrastingly were fundamentally unpolitical and sometimes antipolitical , anarchic ; at least , they no more admired citizenship and the rule of law than they did the bourgeois transformation of public life into an instrumentality of partial interests and domestic obsessions . There is generosity in her account of the elite precisely because her divergence from them is considerably more significant than the fact that they have enemies in common . In a few pages she makes us feel what the elite felt : that bourgeois society was full of deadening routines and the most pervasive sham . The experience of war in the trenches intensified the critique inherited from Nietzsche or Sorel or Bakunin or Rimbaud . The sense of the rotten hollowness of bourgeois life gained authenticity from the irrationality and destructiveness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion to see that life utterly destroyed grew more sharp from the very destructiveness of the war . Arendt says : The self-willed immersion in the suprahuman forces of destruction seemed to be a salvation from the automatic identification with pre-established functions in society and their utter banality . These people felt attracted to the pronounced activism of totalitarian movements , to their curious and only seemingly contradictory insistence on both the primacy of sheer action and the overwhelming force of sheer necessity . This mixture corresponded precisely to the war experience of the " front generation , " to the experience of constant activity within the framework of overwhelming fatality.22 More than anything else , the elite admired the mob aspect of the movements . This aspect represented the surfacing , with earnest , deadly intent , of elements in European society hitherto despised and rejected by the bourgeoisie . The verbal propaganda of the movements , together with the propaganda of the deed ? the coercion and violence in resentful acts of " political expressionism " ? signified the presence of a genuinely antibourgeois group . Two lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , there was the destruction of respectability through the mere prominence and threatened ascendancy of the mob-led movement . Second , the movement 's praise of violence and cruelty came as a relief after the hypocritically liberal and humanist pieties of the bourgeoisie . In a passage that seems equally relevant to the mentality of some urban terrorists today , Arendt describes the deepest source of attractiveness in the mob-led movements : An atmosphere in which all traditional values and propositions had evaporated ... in a sense made it easier to accept patently absurd propositions than the old truths which had become pious banalities , precisely because nobody could be expected to take the absurdities seriously .... What a temptation to flaunt extreme attitudes in the hypocritical twilight of double moral standards , to wear publicly the mask of cruelty if everybody was patently inconsiderate and // pretended to be gentle , to parade wickedness in a world , not of wickedness , but of meanness ! 23 Arendt goes so far as to say that " aversion against the philosemitism of the liberals had much more to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews . " 24 Her rendering of the mentality of the elite opens up the perspective of extremist and totalitarian movements as cleansing , avenging angels . That these movements , when they gained power , crushed the intellectual elite is an irony she underlines . Yet even then , she says , there were a few who saw in the totalitarian repression of individuals like themselves a policy that also answered to a terrific need . She refers to the " perverted selflessness " of some in the elite and connects this disposition to " the totalitarian movements ' spurious claim to have abolished the separation between private and public life and to have restored a mysterious irrational wholeness in man . " 25 With brevity and concentration , Arendt makes vivid an era of European sensibility . Her generosity enhances our understanding and may create sympathy for the disreputable . For some , her powers are wasted because they are spent in humanizing right-wing immoralists and esthetes ; spent on those who , whatever their talent , lodged their affections in movements they should have known would do far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . It may be thought that even though the intellectual elite had little or no direct role in the successful attainment of power by the Nazis or by Stalin , they can not be exonerated . They dishonored their calling just by celebrating the base and the violent . In truth , Arendt 's pages on the elite are a hard test of the reader . But it would be evasive if one refused the encounter that Arendt arranges . The spirits she presents the reader must be studied , and their cruelty seen , finally perhaps , as Arendt would have us see it ? as an embittered kindness , an all-consuming fear of the possibility of human suffocation in an atmosphere of falseness , obtuseness , and selfishness . Of course ? and Arendt knows it unimpeachably ? the cure for bourgeois sickness was itself a worse sickness . That there was a sickness , a pathology , to begin with is the fact that Arendt 's pages make it impossible for us to ignore . Arendt does not extend her exceptional generosity of understanding to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all emerge with heightened humanity . Yet , because there is so much generosity in the book , its absence in regard to particular individuals and groups is all the more striking . The temptation for an admirer is to say that when generosity is absent , when individuals and groups appear either wholly reprehensible or so imposed upon by others as to resemble something lifeless and plastic , then some are simply beyond the reach of generosity . It would be immoral to present them as ripe for revaluation or reconsideration . Why assume that they are more than they appear ? The only reason to resist the admonition of our hypothetical admirers is that Arendt 's analysis may be weakened by an absence of generosity in at least a few instances . Having expanded the humanity of some of the practitioners and // abettors of racism and imperialism , and of some of the friendly observers of totalitarian movements , she may create distortions when she withholds generosity from others . The latter may seem all the worse for the contrast with the former : The former may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to demand that remarkable gifts be evenly distributed , but the book 's ideal proportions may have necessitated more evenness . A definite view on this matter is elusive . Reference to two cases may at least suggest the extent of the difficulties . These pertain to fundamental aspects of Arendt 's analysis of the European society in which totalitarianism was made possible , and of totalitarianism itself : the bourgeoisie , as the dominant class in Europe , the main source of values , opinions , and attitudes ; and the mob . THE BOURGEOISIE All through Arendt 's work , not only in The Origins of Totalitarianism , there is a persistent animosity displayed toward the European bourgeoisie . The story of the bourgeoisie is the story of modern Europe , for Arendt no less than for the Marxists . For Arendt , however , the story of modern Europe ? Europe since the French Revolution ? is the story of pathologies , with Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism as the climactic pathology . The European bourgeoisie is thus , in Arendt 's work , continuously responsible , continuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heroic stature and historical appropriateness that they achieve in the Marxist outlook . What , then , is the heart of the story of the bourgeoisie which is also the story of modern Europe and the story of pathologies ? Arendt sees it as " the nineteenth-century struggle between bourgeois and citoyen , between the man who judged and used all public institutions by the yardstick of his private interests and the responsible citizen who was concerned with public affairs as the affairs of all . " The bourgeoisie pressed private interests " regardless of the common good.i2b A more abstract formulation is found in The Human Condition , in which Arendt speaks of " the rise of the social " and the victory of society over the public in the modern world . The gist is that the stuff of politics is depoliticized ; it changes into economics . Economic interests reduce politics and government to techniques instrumental to " housekeeping , " to getting , holding , and augmenting wealth . The contests between interests are internal and international . If consumerism , welfare economics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph over the truly political , class struggle to control the state and use it for internal aggrandizement or foreign adventures expressed society 's triumph over the truly political in nineteenth-century Europe . The idea of citizenship suffers continuous attenuation . Arendt associates a regard for the common good with the practice of citizenship . Implicit in her conception is another theoretical point : the status of citizen when taken seriously , when taken as at least partly constitutive of one 's identity , and joined to a tradition of citizenly watchfulness over and concern for political life and governmental activity , is the only real guarantor of a sense of limits , and it is one of the main sources of rootedness in reality . Where that status is not // understood , or too recent , or unrealized sufficiently in daily practice and reflection , limitlessness and unreality can take over . What is at issue is not the full citizenship of direct , participatory democracy , but the modern citizenship of constitutional representative democracy ? a kind of citizenship Arendt praises mostly in the form of civil disobedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her writings on modern pathologies . The " political emancipation of the bourgeoisie " is the cause of the decline of citizenship , even though the struggle for enfranchisement is thought to be a sign of bourgeois strength . The tragedy is that their expanded enfranchisement , political power , and influence in general actually resulted in the enfeeblement of citizenship . Citizenship is betrayed , rather than being properly exemplified , by the effort to bend government to a group 's or class 's economic interests . Arendt mentions but does not offer a detailed sociological analysis of the gradations within the bourgeoisie . Nor does she give a sustained explanation of the enormous differences the bourgeoisie shows from country to country , especially the differences between the English bourgeoisie and all others , and the lesser but still important differences between the French bourgeoisie and that of central Europe . The English bourgeoisie exhibited some restraints ; at least they budgeted their cruelty more carefully . In any case , the European bourgeoisie is the main source of pathology and bears the main responsibility for later totalitarianism . Unaffected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons were unleashed : greed ; the logic of capitalist investment ; flattering and convenient doctrines claiming that some individuals or groups or races are superior to others , which were propagated by apologists in bourgeois employ ; and an unbelievable growth in technical capacities , with a corresponding intoxicated hubris . These were the demons of the upper bourgeoisie . Their arrogance engendered an economic system that produced alongside its wealth a tremendous social dislocation , including unemployment , and an irrepressible tendency to expand outside national borders , sponsoring imperialism in Africa and aggressive inclinations at home . With Europe in constant but confused motion , everything was unsettled . The politics of Europe became increasingly susceptible to irrational or desperate responses , the desperation intensified by the greater scale of things ? more people , more demands , increased violence , a greater confidence in the ability to act and find solutions . The feeling of strength waxed with the feeling of vulnerability . The bourgeois system created the mob ; and when its tensions brought on the Great War , it created the masses in war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demons of the lower bourgeoisie . ( Even though all classes were represented in the mob and the masses , their dominant orientation was bourgeois . ) In the middle was the ordinary bourgeoisie , absorbed by the pursuit of income and willing to yield rule to any strongman who could preserve law and order and the sanctity of property while dispensing favors . They were politically indifferent and made political indifference praiseworthy . These were the demons of the middle . Going together with all this ? with the tensions , the racism , the imperialism , the wars ? was that bourgeois culture that so disgusted the elite . // The bourgeoisie was the villain that prepared the way for the evil worse than any villainy . The question is whether Arendt has succeeded in disclosing , by an act of empathetic generosity , the inwardness of the principal members of the bourgeoisie , the principal villains . The answer is that she has not tried . The rapacious business mind , on the one hand , and outwardly conformist respectability , on the other hand , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they remain , in this book , closed to us . We have to go elsewhere to glimpse the souls whose economic quest was as limitless as their social behavior was restricted . She hates the upper bourgeoisie for carrying the virus that weakened or destroyed right citizenship and lawful politics . By a perverse esthetic standard , it is good that the book have some , almost deliberate , blank spot to go with such a superabundance of empathetic understanding . Yet the villainous bourgeoisie is still on the near side of the abyss that separates totalitarian leaders from the rest of humanity . Repeated references to the need to invest " superfluous capital " do not carry enough explanatory weight ? that is , if we expect from Arendt the depth of explanation she ordinarily gives us . At the same time , if we left the inwardness of the bourgeoisie aside , the whole account of imperialism as a solely capitalist phenomenon is deficient . It is just as deficient as the account sometimes given ? though not by Arendt ? of the Great War as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations in both phenomena must be allowed : geopolitics , dynastic rivalry , vainglory and superstition , dislike or suspicion of otherness , and so on . If the story of modern Europe is the story of modern pathology , there are other sources of villainy than the bourgeoisie as the bearers of social hypocrisy and the profit motive . THE MOB The mob figures in Arendt 's analysis in two ways . It is represented among those who went to Africa to plunder it and those who were involved in the agitation of extremist and irregular politics like the anti-Dreyfusard tendency , the pan-movements in central and eastern Europe , and most decisively , the Nazi movement up to the Roehm purge . ( Hitler came from the mob , but he was not merely the mob mentality magnified . ) Sociologically , the mob was the creation of capitalism . Those who comprised the mob were unemployed , yet only a fraction of the unemployed . Arendt rather shockingly refers to them as " the refuse of all classes . " 27 She sees them as the lumpenproletariat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outside class , in part literally criminal , altogether louche . The mob is not the working class ; it is not the people . It is not the norm , despite the widespread existence of pathologies of every sort in European society . But although the mob is not the norm , it is not an accidental eruption of aberrant individuals . Arendt says : The mob is not only the refuse but also the by-product of bourgeois society , directly produced by it and therefore never quite separable from it . They the historical pessimists failed ... to notice high society 's constantly growing // admiration for the underworld , which runs like a red thread through the nineteenth century , its continuous step-by-step retreat on all questions of morality , and its growing taste for the anarchical cynicism of its offspring . At the turn of the century , the Dreyfus Affair showed that underworld and high society in France were so closely bound together that it was difficult definitely to place any of the " heroes " among the Anti-Dreyfusards in either category.28 There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of Arendt 's voice . Refuse is an unacceptable word to use about people . Its use may be symptomatic of some reluctance to understand that stems from a prejudice not entirely dissimilar from snobbery . If there were ( and are ) snobs who feel or affect a nostalgie de la boue and thus admire the mob , and if there were ( and are ) snobs who find the mob odious because of its vehement lack of respectability , there are also snobs who look at the mob and fail to master their disgust and therefore fail to see humanity . These latter would be the snobs of virtue or decency . Probably a better way of putting it is to say that even Arendt has to have polemical moments . The mob , after all , provided the leaders , the massed bodies , and the shock troops of totalitarian movements . It instigated totalitarianism . But it must be understood more intimately than Arendt has understood it . Arendt says , at one point , that the " more gifted were walking incarnations of resentment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptual world of Nietzsche and Scheler , where the human traits of envy , frustration , and revenge seize the soul and possess it . But there was nothing secretly subversive in the mob . It fully acted out its negative passions . It therefore escapes the analysis of Nietzsche and Scheler , or at least its central thrust . We can not append their analysis to Arendt 's with the aim of filling it out consonantly to her overall sensibility . The issue is crucial because the mob was crucial to the success of totalitarianism . Arendt does not take us inside the souls of its members . It may be that one writer does : Dostoyevsky . He may provide us with as much help as we can expect . In the character of Pyotr Stepanovitch Verhovensky in The Possessed , we may come as close as we can to inspecting the soul of one of the mob , a leader of a mob . Yet the very word mob may obscure our understanding . It heaps together large numbers of people whose differences may matter greatly . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions were radically unpredictable and stemmed from idiosyncrasies . The influence of personalities on action was exceptionally pronounced , and action was therefore strange , unaccustomed . That is why we need to know them from the inside . The Elements of Totalitarianism In antisemitism and in imperialism in Africa , in the intellectual elite , the bourgeoisie , and the mob , Arendt locates the elements that provided the necessary conditions for the appearance of totalitarianism . She tries to throw light on all these elements . This endeavor is of course preliminary to an examination of totalitarianism itself . We may say schematically that in The Origins of Totalitarianism and elsewhere , Arendt studies the phenomenon of // totalitarianism by seeking to understand its main constituent elements : the masses , the functionaries , and the leadership . THE MASSES Traumatic events destroyed the articulation of a disciplined class structure in the interwar period . When classes disintegrated , people became masses . The term refers to the great majority . Without the masses there would have been no totalitarianism . First : totalitarian movements are possible " wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the appetite for political organization . " 30 Second : What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world is the fact that loneliness , once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age , has become an everyday experience of the evergrowing masses of our century . The merciless process into which totalitarianism drives and organizes the masses looks like a suicidal escape from this reality.3 ' Arendt refers to the " indisputable popularity " of Hitler and Stalin in power.32 She explicitly says that totalitarianism answers to the needs of men . Beyond that , the " mass-man " came into ever greater prominence in totalitarian regimes , supplanting the mob elements . The masses , that is , supplied the personnel , whose unquestioning loyalty and obedience kept totalitarian regimes in motion . They carried out the policies of evil . Now the masses did not originate these policies ; they did not want them , necessarily . They were not drawn to totalitarian movements by the promise of genocide . While genocide was taking place , most of the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arendt is not accusing the masses of murderousness , of willing that totalitarianism be carried to its completely self-consistent conclusion . Once again , Arendt is careful to distinguish the leaders , the givers of orders , from everyone else . But the plain truth , as Arendt sees it , is that the masses accepted some part of the totalitarian outlook on life , and welcomed some part of the translation of that outlook into action and the general disposition toward activism . They did so with some voluntariness : Terror and propaganda were not the sole causes of their acceptance and compliance . And some representative men from the masses carried quite easily the burden of systematic murderousness once the orders were given . The psychological understanding of the masses must therefore occupy a central place in Arendt 's analysis , and it does . Obviously she is not the only one who has essayed an understanding of the masses involved in totalitarianism . But to her analysis should be applied the standard she has made us expect : generosity of understanding . In regard to the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for those who took direct part in genocide ; she provides a fresh way of looking at the condition of the masses ; but there is a cold abstractness of analysis that precludes a rendering of the pathos of the ordinary person in harrowing circumstances . The conceptualization of the masses is one of the most brilliant achievements in the book : It has the brilliance that a supremely resourceful // creation of character has . But is the created character truly that of the masses , or is it rather a construction divorced in some respects from actuality ? This is not a question with an answer , but it is not an idle one either . Arendt works with a cluster of notions : loneliness , superfluousness , uprootedness , lostness . The emphasis is on loneliness , but at times the other notions are used synonymously or to fill out the notion of loneliness . ( These concepts have some relation to the concept of alienation discussed in Chapter 5 . ) In discussing the mob Arendt had already invoked the notion of superfluousness . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel dispensable , extraneous . Arendt suggests that this is a historically new feeling . It lay behind the mob 's irrational and punitive or exploitative behavior , either in Europe or in Africa . Unemployment continued to engender the feeling of superfluousness and related feelings in the twentieth century , with special sharpness in the period after the Great War . So that trying to account for the invasion of society by those feelings , those experiences , which prepare large numbers of people for totalitarian movements and regimes , Arendt assigns a major role to unemployment . To illustrate the experience of uprootedness , Arendt takes up the related phenomena of transfer of populations after the Great War , the presence of countless deported or stateless people , and forced or free emigration . The impact on those who suffered these experiences and also those who witnessed them was immense . She says about those who were uprooted : " To be uprooted means to have no place in the world , recognized and guaranteed by others .... Uprootcdness can be the preliminary condition for superfluousness. " 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone , in the absence of relief and rescue , to a diminished sense of self-worth that facilitated nonresistance and even acceptance of any treatment . Their plight could not have but imparted a pervasive sentiment throughout Europe of the fragility of human life and , ultimately , of its unreality . To the Great War itself , Arendt pays scant attention . She does pay exquisite attention to the way the war changed the intellectual elite . But she generalizes the effects of the war into the concept of the breakdown of the class system and the corresponding emergence of " an atomized and individualized mass.i34 The class system represented clear and delimited loyalties , interests , and expectations . These delimitations helped to constitute the self by establishing surety for the self . The war smashed the class system . Arendt says : The number of the mass of generally dissatisfied and desperate men increased rapidly in Germany and Austria after the First World War , when inflation and unemployment added to the disrupting consequences of military defeat . ' All the elements are named in this sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then dwell on each , and then connect them and make them into the very condition of life that begged for a radically novel solution . The loss of ties , the loss of work , the poverty , the sense of nations ' shame and mutilation , the erosion of surety , and the inevitable confusion in the sense of self can , together , be called " loneliness . " The word still can strike one as remote from a condition that probably requires a description and an analysis // with a different tonality from that in ' which " loneliness " is the organizing concept ( or metaphor ) . Arendt is clear that when she speaks of masses she is not endorsing the views of those who deplore the spread of education and leisure to the hitherto excluded , and who lament the overall equality of condition in modern society . She strains to purge her discourse on the masses of any reactionary condescension . She explicitly excludes the American people from the category of masses : Indeed , they are less like masses , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds in not being reactionary . I doubt , however , that she is free of a certain coldness or remoteness that resembles condescension . The masses were victims : She does not manage to convey that thought without faintly discrediting the victims . The fact that many industrial workers resisted the seduction of totalitarian movements shows that humanity is capable of a humane response no matter how desperate the condition . Arendt notices this fact with approval . But surely that can not be used to relegate the rest to the status of masses , an undifferentiated aggregation of lost and lonely souls . There is power in Arendt 's depiction . What is missing is the sense vividly caught recently in Ingmar Bergman 's movie The Serpent 's Egg ? the sense of hopelessness that can come over people when a number of traumas converge , any one of which would be enough to demoralize and unsettle them . The convergence disposed them to welcome a seemingly heroic resolve to save them . To put it flatly : The masses made totalitarianism possible . The flat assertion is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mislead , it must go : The desperate and legitimate needs of the victimized masses made totalitarianism possible . Just as the masses did not choose their misery , so they did not choose a remedy that they knew would lead to the wars and extermination camps of totalitarianism . Yet I fear that I have exercised a leniency toward the masses that I have no right to exercise . Out of the masses , out of the aggregation of the lost and desperate souls , did come the SS and other murderers . ( The Stalinist system is given separate treatment by Arendt . ) She says that the original leaders of the Nazi movement and regime were from the mob ; but the future , if the Nazis had lasted longer , would have been with the mass-men , not the mob . Himmler was the type of the future leader . Yet Nazism lasted long enough for the mass-men to carry out as subordinates the genocide ordered by Hitler and wanted by his principal functionaries . Arendt does not always say that any member of the masses ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easily have done what a few did . In the analysis contained in The Origins of Totalitarianism , some quality sets off the few from the rest , whether fanatical hatred of the Jews , fanatical devotion to the leader and his plans , some private depravity , or something else . This untypicality was signaled by the fact that for a time only volunteers were used for the policies of extermination . The masses supplied volunteers : That is the inescapable fact . If not all in the majority were eager , all those who were eager came from the majority . No prior experience of desperation in the Weimar period can extenuate , much less excuse , this criminality . If that is so , then any concern to dwell on the // pathos of the Weimar period , any wish to penetrate to the inwardness of mass-men , is not to lack generosity of understanding , but to want a mindless exculpation . The trouble is that by the time Arendt wrote Eichmann in Jerusalem ( written in 1962 and published in 1963 ) , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished from conceiving and ordering them ? that seems independent of the masses and their misery , their loneliness , uprootedness , and superfluousness . Eichmann was not an executioner in his own person ; he was not a mere cog in the machine . He was a " desk murderer . " 37 In these respects he differed from the average participant in atrocities . Yet he was like them . In Arendt 's portrait , Eichmann is without any strong passions or beliefs . He is therefore the average mass-man as philistine . Before Eichmann in Jerusalem and even before The Origins of Totalitarianism were published , Arendt had sketched the good family man and jobholder as " the great criminal of the century . " 38 Of course the experience of unemployment is in the background , but Arendt 's analysis focuses on the compatibility of a normal family life and either sexual or dutiful implication in the greatest atrocities . The good family man could be either a sadist or a " regime criminal . " 39 The essentially private person , anxious to make a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the idea of citizenship , is the perfect cog : He has driven the dichotomy of private and public functions , of family and occupation , so far that he can no longer find in his own person any connection between the two . When his occupation forces him to murder people he does not regard himself as a murderer because he has not done it out of inclination but in his professional capacity . Out of sheer passion he would never do harm to a fly.4o In The Origins of Totalitarianism , Arendt presents a similar description but does not make it central . In Eichmann in Jerusalem it is central . Its thrust is not to trace involvement in atrocities to the masses and their past trauma , to feelings of loneliness , uprootedness , or superfluousness . The phenomenon is altogether different . Eichmann was not able to think : he could not recognize himself in others ; he could not act on his feeble and intermittent awareness that Jews were human beings too . Arendt does not , in turn , trace this incapacity for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor offers a broadly sociological explanation of it . It may be that the description of Eichmann is extendable to most of the executioners.41 There is a much firmer conceptual link between atrocities and the nearly universal tendency to compartmentalize life than between atrocities and the experience of loneliness.42 Add to compartmentalization the nearly universal ability to make any activity into a routine that deadens the awareness of what is being done , provided steps are taken to shield the senses to some degree . Only at the start of an activity does shocked response have a chance to deter involvement . But many considerations , many pressures , all , work in the direction of absorbing the shock and not letting it guide action . Arendt provides a splendid itemization of these considerations and pressures in the book on Eichmann . If the concept of being unable to think is extendable beyond Eichmann , then the idea of masses seems not to do the work Arendt // wants it to do in The Origins of Totalitarianism . On the assumption that the idea of masses can not explain the readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an obscene leniency to ask that a psychologist as great as she show more generosity in understanding those who , because of their suffering , put their desperate hope in a false redeemer . Why call thoughtless murderers mass-men ? Then , too , why call distressed people masses ? Must there be masses when classes decay ? This is not to say , however , that " civilized " ordinariness in the willing service of genocide or serious wrongdoing is itself not mysterious . Such ordinariness may not be depravity or inhuman blackness of heart . It may not be radical evil in the Kantian understanding : a Satanic disposition " to adopt evil as evil.i43 It may not be Milton 's Satan saying , " Evil be thou my Good , " 44 or Claggart in Billy Budd tormented by an innocence he must torment.45 But it may be something altogether more strange : a nonhuman blankness . To speak of Eichmann and others as " terribly and terrifyingly normal " 46 is in fact , to preserve the mystery : Arendt can not mean that normality as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully caught by such culturally unspecific characterizations as an inability to think or to judge . I believe that thoughtlessness of the Nazi sort and scale is possible only in a culture that can produce and respect a sentence like the following : Even if a civil society were to dissolve itself by common agreement of all its members ( for example , if the people inhabiting an island decided to separate and disperse themselves around the world ) , the last murderer remaining in prison must first be executed , so that everyone will duly receive what his actions are worth and so that the bloodguilt thereof will not be fixed on the people because they failed to insist on carrying out the punishment ; for if they fail to do so they may be regarded as accomplices in this public violation of legal justice.47 To think that there is only rigor where there is cruelty ; and that a sense of duty can serve only rigor ; is a cultural deformation that precedes the advent of masses.48 Whatever other problems remain concerning the concept of being unable to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses . The Essence of Totalitarianism THE LEADERS AND FUNCTIONARIES What of the leaders ? What of Hitler and Stalin , especially ? Do we understand them better for the principled avoidance of psychological explanation ? Arendt is a generous psychologist much of the time ; when she is not generous , she is nevertheless provocative and instructive . Her acumen , her subtlety , and her perceptive energies are of the highest order . Yet , in all her psychological strength , she says that totalitarian leadership is best understood unpsychologically . We must now look more closely at her concept of totalitarianism if we arc to grasp her view of the leaders . Arendt 's analysis of totalitarianism is principally based on Hitler 's regime . The consideration of Stalinism is secondary , even though it is by no means // casual or introduced for the sake of some convenient symmetry . It may turn out that some features of her analysis , some of its levels or some of its particulars , may not apply to Stalinism . It may even turn out as well that her characterization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still think that her concept of totalitarianism helps in understanding Stalin 's system , not only Hitler 's . What , then , is totalitarianism ? First let us see what Arendt says it is not . It is not tyranny , the form of government that it seems at least to resemble and to which it is often assimilated . Ordinarily , tyranny means the absolute rule of one man ( although the concept is sometimes stretched to include the rule of a few and sometimes , as by Tocqueville , to include the democratic many ) . The tyrant aspires to total power over his subjects , usually with the aim of enjoying his power . Arendt speaks of tyranny as arbitrary power serving the interest of the tyranny and as being hostile to the interests of the people . ' " She does not say what the tyrant 's interest is . But it may be possible to suggest that though she was not sympathetic to the view that mankind has an innate power drive or love of power ? power in the conventional sense of command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as interested in feeling pleasure from making people do what he wants them to do and what they do not want to do . The tyrant is an extreme bully tending to sadism ; one who is likely to be bloodthirsty ; one who at once seeks to crush all resistance to his will yet delights in the occasional opportunity to experience resistance so that he may crush it . Indeed , he may even provoke it to have the pleasure of crushing it . The tyrant wants to be feared or revered like a god ; he wants to stand out as not only preeminent , but as the only one capable of doing things , making things happen ; the only one with a public identity . Pure tyranny is best rendered by Orwell in 1984 , although his rendering may seem not wholly credible and almost impurely to exult in the depicted cruelty . The tyrant is not interested in anything but his own power : its retention , enlargement , and display . He will do anything for power ; and it maybe that he is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his career of power . He thus combines terrible means with a terrible end . Arendt is saying that neither Hitler nor Stalin was a tyrant . Or at least neither was only a tyrant , even though both practiced some of the immemorial arts of the tyrant . She attributes to neither one the love of power for power 's sake : that is , love of power for the pleasure it gives of compelling others to do what they do not want to do , to the point where it seems that it is only because they do not want to do it that the tyrant wants them to do it . At this extreme , perversity is intrinsic to tyranny . Even at this extreme , the tyrant is not to be taken for the totalitarian ruler . On the other hand , Arendt 's analysis points to the conclusion that neither Hitler nor Stalin was what we may call instrumental tyrants or dictators . They were not leaders who would do anything to achieve a purpose that seems describable by reference to utility or practicality ? ruthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform , reinvigorate , mobilize , or modernize , and who seek total power to achieve that purpose , independently of the pleasure of power . She does not see them as great bad men . The temptation is // especially strong to see Stalin in this way ? a way best caught by Arthur Koestler in Darkness at Noon . This way of seeing Stalin her analysis would lead us to deplore and to reject . It tends to a long-term exoneration , which would be bad by itself , but much worse , it falsely attributes to Stalin an overriding purpose of utility or practicality . In fact , Stalin , like Hitler , had no such purpose and enlisted those who had such a purpose for an altogether different purpose , neither useful nor practical , and , indeed , a purpose that actually impeded the useful and the practical . Thus neither Hitler nor Stalin was , in essence , a ruthless dictator in the usual sense . What emerges so far is that for Arendt neither the aspiration toward total power nor the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of totalitarianism . The tyrant intoxicated by the wielding of power and the purposive leader of complete unscrupulousness ? two types that may often seem more easily differentiated in theory than in the historical examples that present themselves for analysis and judgment ? are not entirely discontinuous with ordinary human nature . As Plato instructs us , even the best soul dreams of doing what tyrants actually do . Pride , vanity , egotism , and megalomania infect us all , even if to greatly varying degrees . We are always on the verge of seizure by obsession . On the other hand , normal politics is stamped by an abatement of scruples , by at least a tincture ? perhaps a necessary tincture ? of ruthlessness . Thus , the tyrant and the ruthless leader are each of us , but grossly exaggerated , or they are rulers , grossly exaggerated . To explain them , if Plato is right , is only to have recourse to considerations that explain each of us . The point is that for Arendt totalitarian leadership is not to be explained so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeds are not explainable by any of the usual ways in which we try to make sense of what may disturb or appall us . Correspondingly , the deeds themselves arc also distinctive . To suggest Arendt 's idea of totalitarianism is necessarily to gather together the various elements she deploys in her work . These elements , which are taken mostly from The Origins of Totalitarianism , can be synthesized as follows . Totalitarianism is genocide , a methodical genocide " within the frame of a legal order . " 50 Totalitarianism is the methodical killing of certain populations on a large scale ( involving millions ) undertaken deliberately and as a matter of policy by those in power , whose overriding aim is to kill such populations , and to kill them even though they are not hostile or even dissident , or even unwitting obstacles to any purpose of utility or practicality , or even in possession of worldly goods of any sort that their killers need , want , or covet . To the rational observer , totalitarianism is as gratuitous as it is methodical : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a total absence or emptiness of purpose . Even the word mad , used when Captain Ahab has " some glimpse " that all his means are sane but his motive and his object are mad , does not capture the totalitarian purpose . Arendt 's analysis takes us far beyond as well the closing pages of The Protestant Ethic , where Weber attaches the extremest rationality of method to a compulsive pursuit ? the aim of which seems almost forgotten or non-existent ? a cojoining he likens to sport , if only half-heartedly.51 ( His real lesson is that // after a certain point a desire to increase rationality of method is a symptom of irrational purpose . ) Any one of the elements of the synthesized definition of totalitarianism , or even some combination of them , may be present in other events or conditions . History exhibits enormous massacres , abundant conquest and imperialism , heartless expropriations , wretched conditions of confinement or servitude , and systems of racial and religious discrimination . Just as it shows many tyrants or near-tyrants and many ruthless leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power or control , it shows countless episodes of systematic cruelty . But Arendt insists on totalitarian distinctiveness : Only under Hitler and Stalin was there methodical genocide within the frame of a legal order . " In the case of Hitler , although he was responsible for the deaths of many Poles , Ukrainians , White Russians , and Russians , many more than the number of Jews he had killed , the killing of Jews was the essence and the differentiation of his totalitarianism . He also killed Gypsies as he killed Jews , but all one can say is that there were fewer Gypsies to kill . Of course , from a certain point of view the numbers killed can not matter ; the killing of any one innocent soul is an atrocity . Arendt 's radical thesis , then , is that totalitarian rulers are to be understood in their essence as mass killers of objectively unthreatening populations in an age where mass killing is easily and antiseptically done . If the aim is to understand totalitarianism , we can not remain content with a structural analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A particular policy dictated the structure . The will to kill was the ultimate source of totalitarian structures , structures of total or near-total power or domination . A mere syndrome of the structural characteristics of total power leaves the meaning of Nazism and Stalinism unaddressed.53 Arendt is saying that the real place of totalitarianism was the death camp : the scene where the true purpose of totalitarianism ? extermination ? was realized . It was also an experimental laboratory for techniques of total control ; a model for society as a whole , one 's own or a conquered one , in the near or distant future ; and an image of terror by which to discipline and intimidate people outside the camps . She says that the motto of the camps and hence of totalitarianism was " everything is possible . " We might ramify Arendt 's analysis and say that in relation to some Hitler was a tyrant and to others a ruthless leader , so that he could be to the Jews ( and the Gypsies ) a totalitarian ruler . Stalin eludes Arendt 's characterization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in essence , merely a ruthless leader . But in relation to all those whose fate he directly affected , he may have been " only " a tyrant . He may have wanted total control because he wanted not only to be number one , but to be the only one , the only man , alone capable of initiating action , and aiming to convert a whole society into his shaping clay . The oriental despot a outrance , he could not endure anyone with the slightest dignity or independence , traits that in hisparanoia54 he saw as a threat not to his plans , but to his very identity . He was a madman of such bloodiness that perhaps the word mad should not be used about him . He not merely preferred policies that would exact an immense human cost , he defined policy as that which exacted an immense human cost . // The overarching question is , How could someone order a policy that killed millions of men , women , and children who never opposed him and would have obeyed him had he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is that he was a racist . He believed that Jews ( and Gypsies ) were not only inferior but subhuman ? noxious and fit only to be destroyed . Alternatively , he was afraid that the Jews really were superior , and wanted them dead just for that reason . Or he thought the Jews were unassimilable , despite their formal assimilation in Germany , and that so long as any were alive a tradition of criticism , nonconformity , deviance , or corrupt sophistication would continue and thus erode the purity or unity of a people . Arendt mentions all these possibilities . The problem is to explain how anyone can go from virulent racism to genocide . Arendt says : " There is an abyss between the men of brilliant and facile conceptions the mid-nineteenth-century theorists of race-thinking and men of brutal deeds and active bestiality the death-camp killers which no intellectual explanation is able to bridge . X55 Those who killed face to face were psychopathological : An " intellectual explanation " does not explain them as it explains the abstract theoreticians . There was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already said that unfathomable evil need not come from unfathomable depravity . The leaders were not psychopathological . How , then , can they be explained intellectually ? A beginning is made when we see that the passion that conceives and initiates a policy need not be commensurate to the scale of that policy . There need not be an inside to match the outside , so to speak . Actually , there can not be an inside to match the outside when the outside is so vast . Activities of any kind , provided they are part of a system and on a large scale , dwarf the instigating passions . The involvement of numerous people as helpers and accomplices does not provide an accumulation of passion ? an addition that yields some huge sum , some gigantic passion that no one person has , but that the collectivity does have . To think in this way is to be deceived . There is an accumulation of energy and hence of the power to act , as there may be diverse but compatible purposes . But that is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lines , Arendt helps to clear away confusion , so long as we remember what now and then she obscures ; namely , that there were instigating passions of horrible strength and eventually self-destructive tenacity . Arendt is willing to toss out some brief characterizations of Hitler and his principal functionaries . She says of the " normal " Himmler : " He was not a bohemian like Goebbels , or a sex criminal like Streicher , or a crackpot like Rosenberg , or a fanatic like Hitler , or an adventurer like Goering. " 56 By themselves these labels lead nowhere . There were and are millions of people in each category , but Hitler and his circle were unique . Her emphasis is that they were unique in what they caused to be done , not in what they were . Arendt says of Eichmann : " Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement , he had no motives at all . " 57 He was not an Iago or Macbeth or Richard III : He was not a villain . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a book Arendt greatly admired , are kin of Eichmann , and their characterization throws light on Arendt 's characterization of Eichmann . ) On the other hand , Hitler and his circle were // evil beyond villainy , and they did have motives . Only , the motive ? to destroy Jewry ? was not sustained by a passion equal to it , and could not be . The presence of a motive may distinguish the top circle from Eichmann and his like . Yet Arendt seems at times to draw them all together in a common shallowness , a common " word-and-thought-defying banality of evil . " 58 In her reply to Gershom Scholem 's criticism of her book on Eichmann , she said that she had changed her mind from the time she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism . She no longer wanted to use the concept of " radical evil " : It is indeed my opinion now that evil is never " radical , " that it is only extreme , and that it possesses neither depth nor any demonic dimension . It can overgrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fungus on the surface . It is " thought-defying , " as I said , because thought tries to reach some depth , to go to the roots , and the moment it concerns itself with evil , it is frustrated because there is nothing . That is its " banality . " Only the good has depth and can be radical . ' ' Evil-doing is thus banal even when the initiator of evil acts , not only when others follow . Here Arendt is overworking her thesis . She is in the grip of what she says is one of her main intentions in writing the book on Eichmann : " to destroy the legend of the greatness of evil , of the demonic force , to take away from people the admiration they have for the great evildoers like Richard IIL " 60 But we should not take her best sense to be that the concept of " the banality of evil " applies to Hitler and his top associates . If unfathomable depths should not be assumed , neither should shallowness . To account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arendt offers in place of psychology a redescription of the totalitarian phenomenon . As her analysis proceeds in The Origins of Totalitarianism , totalitarianism is disclosed as the disposition to live a fiction or live by a fiction or enact a fiction or make the world over into a fiction.61 Totalitarianism is a systematic way of refusing the given reality and remaking it with an absolute lack of restraint . The leadership , which initiates and inspires , imagines without restraint ; the abettors act as if restraint simply were an irrelevant consideration . An alternative formulation is that totalitarian leaders show the latent murderousness inherent in estheticism : a readiness to sacrifice anything to the " consonance of their own system , " or to its " beautiful ' consistency . " 62 Arendt says that the emotional relation to the fiction varied with the group . The sympathetic outsiders were the only ones who believed " loyally and textually in the Leader 's words . " 63 They were the ones who most craved an intelligible world , who experienced the void created by the failure of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe the propaganda put out for mass consumption , but " it believes all the more fervently the standard cliches of ideological explanation , the keys to past and future history which totalitarian movements took from nineteenthcentury ideologies , and transformed , through organization , into a working reality . " 64 How about the leaders ? The elite did not believe in the literal truth of the cliches . In the minds of the elite resided the greatest cynicism combined with the greatest gullibility . The gullibility , however , was not doctrinal in any usual sense . Arendt says : // The elite is not composed of ideologists ; its members ' whole education is aimed at abolishing their capacity for distinguishing between truth and falsehood , between reality and fiction . Their superiority consists in their ability immediately to dissolve every statement of fact into a declaration of purpose . In distinction to the mass membership which , for instance , needs some demonstration of the inferiority of the Jewish race before it can safely be asked to kill Jews , the elite formations understand that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews should be killed.64 Elite gullibility was behaviorial and issued in automatic enactment . They claimed that Jews were subhuman and then treated them in ways that made them subhuman . An absolute absence of restraint sustained the leaders in the initiation and direction of the fiction . The fiction was the world to come . It was a self-realizing fiction because no restraint stood in the way of the realization . Alt The magical proficiency of coordinated action sustained the absolute absence of restraint . Modern technology contributed to the phenomenon but was not its heart . The few wanted to redesign the world because they could ; they could because they wanted to . They were drunk with the possibilities of action . One point can be added to Arendt 's theory . Totalitarian leaders carried beyond all limits a habit of thought commonly present in political action : to transfer the categories of face-to-face action in private life to massive public action . For example , acting out of concern for reputation in everyday life ordinarily excludes force and injury to others ; in politics , especially international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the hold of the analogy between personal and organizational action is too great for political actors to care much about the cost of what they do . The change in scale is a qualitative change , but it is barely noticed . Totalitarian leaders carried this murderous abstractness to the limit.ss Detached from the inherited reality by decades of war , poverty , and social dislocation , totalitarian leaders jumped over the intermediate desire to restore normality and embarked on the journey to a new world . If there is , at the start , a hatred of the substance of reality for its pain and ugliness , there grows a " contempt " for anything that already is just because it is : It has not been made.67 The only endurable world is a world that owes its being to the enacted fiction . Their model was the secret society , but they surpassed the model . It was no accident that the enacted fiction was murderous . The means were the end ; methodical genocide was the raison d'etre of totalitarianism . The fact that both Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and war is proof of their enslavement to their fiction . Hitler made war so that he could perfect totalitarian control ; 68 he " believed that he would need a war as a smoke-screen for his non-military killing operations . " 69 He wanted to commit genocide so that his ideology would be actualized . But the question persists : Why was the fiction murderous ? Why did Hitler and his associates want to commit genocide ? Arendt is saying that there can be no answer that goes beyond the considerations already adduced . This great psychologist can not give an answer : not because there are depths psychology can not reach , but because there are no depths . The answer can not be // psychological , or at least it can not be psychologically subtle or ingenious . The mystery of evil is that there is no mystery . " Only the good has depth and can be radical . " 70 But can we dispense altogether with psychological exploration ? Just as Eichmann 's blankness can not be explained entirely unpersonally , unpsychologically , so Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal or " clown " as Arendt in her Brechtian moments says.71 With the help of Horkheimer and Adorno we can say something she hints at but does not develop.72 The point is that only a moral or pseudomoral passion makes it possible for a modern European group to embrace and then enact a murderous fantasy ? a genocidal fantasy . It is of the essence that Hitler was a racist fanatic . There are limits to the explanatory efficacy of such considerations as the gap between motive and the scale of activity , or the power of abstractness , or the role of clownish criminality . Belief was his animating energy . Arendt does suggest that " scientificality , " the pseudoscientific nature of racist ideology , facilitated the deeds of Hitler in an age worshipful of science.73 But the pseudomoral was and is more potent than the pseudoscientific . The deepest cause of the Nazi destruction of Jews ( and Gypsies ) was the conviction that the people put to death were being punished for the worst possible sin , not crime . The worst possible sin , Protestantism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marxist materialism echoed it ) was not behavioral but ontological , with the sinners deserving damnation all the more because they were not responsible . They could not be responsible , after all , for who they were . The Jews ( and Gypsies ) were punished for being unclean and hence as unfit to live , as unfit to " share the earth . " 74 Nazism was the enactment of a myth ( in the Sorelian sense of myth ) ? a myth of punishment ? the most punitive , perhaps , of all myths . The myth is also sufficiently broad to accommodate a wide range of terrifying urges to work revenge on life by destroying anything vulnerably distinctive , as well as able to absorb the loyalty of every sort of banal , conformist , or shallow human type . ( Nazi crimes against Slavic peoples , although on a greater scale , need a different and considerably more conventional conceptualization . ) By this account , totalitarianism is an exorcism . But , as always , exorcism is self-exorcism : To kill the Jew in oneself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this , however , is only to be led more deeply into perplexity . What is this Jew that must be exorcised ? And by extension , what groups might one day be assigned the role of victim in a new ideology , a new myth of punishment ? Most of the human race ? The best counsel is to remain in perplexity . Such counsel is found in a remark Arendt makes , even though she seems with time to have thought she could dispense with its good sense : There is a mystery about the Nazi regime , but it has nothing to do with secrets . It resides solely in a response , humanly unavoidable , that makes us go on asking , " Why ? but why ? " long after all the facts are reported , all stages of the process known , all conceivable motives considered.75 Without Arendt 's insistence on the distinctiveness of totalitarianism , we could not begin to take the phenomenon with the gravity it demands . The problems // within her concepts and methods count for little in comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not 's exploration of the evil of totalitarianism does not lead her to look for trtuge in a public realm where the moral opposites of totalitarianism would veign . To the contrary , she is eager to conceptualize a realm that either is not charged with moral purposes ( politics as imagined in the light of the polis ) or is made moral only from an indissociable connection to a political artifice , a constitution ( modern politics ) . Her writing continually disparages the transfer of moral preoccupations to political life . She adopts a severe attitude toward absolute as distinguished from ordinary morality , especially activist absolute morality ; and she finds only minimal uses for abstentionist absolute morality . This chapter will elaborate on the view suggested in Chapter 1 : that Arendt 's challenge to absolute morality in behalf of the prestige and freedom of political action , whether Greek or modern , is seriously questionable . Her treatment of : t may overlook important considerations . When they are recognized , perhaps absolute morality can have a larger political role than she allows . Arendt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aura it - iv have for her readers , in an effort analogous to and connected with her impeachment of philosophy in The Lift of the Mind ( see the Appendix ) . She does not try to debunk the concept of absolute morality:to show , for instance , that those who try to practice it are always self-deluded or hypocritical . But she does try to analyze it in such a way as to compromise it . This does not mean -n at Arendt 's analysis is anything but complex . In truth , it has the complexity ? f.at comes from the mastery of almost contradictory impulses . The net mpression of this , which her whole work gives , including The Life of the Mind is - . , t entirely sharp . At the risk of making it sharper than it really is , I would , gent that her main emphasis is to ease acceptance of political action in the ce of that resistance to it which comes from some deep or even merely sidual attachment to the spirit of absolute morality . ( Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to overcome or erode . ) Rejection of the Lesser Evil Arendt introduces a number of arguments to explain her insistence on the antagonism between absolute morality and the practice of politics . What is curious is that she is not interested in making the standard point that the realm // of politics can only be the realm of the lesser evil , and that therefore office-holders and citizens can never aspire to purity , but must be prepared to use any means , to do any kind or amount of evil , provided it is needed to avoid or remedy a greater evil . This sort of calculation , presumably allowed by ordinary morality , is foreign to her for two main reasons . First , true political action is intrinsically valuable . It is exhilarating and fulfilling ; it is the sole or main opportunity for the display or acquisition of certain immensely valuable human characteristics ; it helps to differentiate humanity from the other animals ; it alone leads , if indeliberately , to mutual understanding and acknowledgment on the part of the group of peers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals to grow reconciled to their existence . Given this conception of political action , the idea of the lesser evil seems to miss the point , to make politics falsely tragic . Second , even where politics ? or what passes for politics ? is not practiced according to her ideal , Arendt 's objection remains . She finds that doing the lesser evil is never what its practitioners claim it is . It may seem paradoxical that she both reserves little place for absolute morality in political life and condemns the usual conceptual alternative , the lesser evil , as the proper political form of ordinary morality . I do not know how to ease the paradox , except to say that she wants her grounds to be that ordinary morality itself is not compatible with doing the lesser evil , even in political life . Specifically , neither her selective version of ordinary morality nor her notion of constitutional justice ( both discussed in Chapter 1 ) is meant to be compatible with doing the lesser evil . How does Arendt arrive at this conclusion ? The core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser evil forget quickly that they chose evil . " i Her sense is that no moral idea is more amenable to abuse than the lesser evil . She is willing to allow ? more by implication than by assertion ? that self-defense is an excuse for " the crime " an individual may commit when in peril . She seems reluctant , however , to see the right of self-defense unproblematically extended from the individual 's physical being to the state 's allegedly analogous being.2 In any case , her position seems to allow doing the lesser evil for the purpose of self-defense . To that degree , Arendt allows what ordinary morality allows . The lesser evil is the necessary evil , but only under the strictest definition of necessity ; and it remains evil , a " crime , " even when necessary . Arendt knows how conveniently plastic necessity is . To be at ease with the idea that one must sometimes do evil guarantees that one will do it when unnecessary . She goes so far as to say that the result will be that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw out her view when we say that it is wrong to entrust any government with the warrant to do anything it pleases to any individual or group provided the ultimate result can plausibly be described as benefit to the greater number . The whole utilitarian enterprise of calculating harms and benefits is alien to her . That is to say , when the idea of the lesser evil passes into the related idea that one may do evil for the sake of a positive good , all restraint is lost . Arendt explicitly repudiates the doctrine that the end justifies the means ? specifically , that any conceivable political end could justify // unrestricted means.4 Nevertheless , when she discusses founding a political society rather than governing one , she seems to allow that good can , indeed must , come from evil . She gives a matter-of-fact restatement of the " universally applicable tales " of Cain and Abel and Romulus and Remus : " Whatever brotherhood human beings may be capable of has grown out of fractricide , whatever political organization men may have achieved has its origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilitarianism will be made into a habit or the code of daily political conduct . To be sure , she does not elaborate a theory of basic rights as antiutilitarian restrictions on policy . She does not say that a society 's constitutional commitment to individual rights is one political form of absolute or near-absolute morality ? as in fact it is . Still the tendency of her thinking is in this direction . But Arendt 's main concern is not doing evil for the sake of good , but the way in which Nazi totalitarianism exploited the idea of the lesser evil . First , it created a situation in which those who took part in the policy of methodical genocide could charge those who refused to take part with irresponsibility . " We who appear guilty today are in fact those who stayed on the job in order to prevent worse things from happening . " 6 The initial readiness to do the lesser evil " responsibly " provides the energy by which the quantity of supposedly necessary evil is constantly increased . The " extermination of Jews was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was accepted because refusal to co-operate would make things worse ? until a stage was reached where nothing worse could happen . " 7 Yet the hold of the idea of the lesser evil had become unbreakable . Arendt also suggests that when the amount of evil is so large as to be " monstrous , " the very idea of the lesser evil turns into a lunatic parody of itself . If the idea has any plausibility at all , it can cover evil only on a small scale , just as evil in the particular form of violence is allowable only for a limited purpose.8 Even so , she spurns the calculation that with " 100 victims we shall save a 1,000. " 9 Arendt 's cautionary remarks about the idea of the lesser evil are valuable . However , she is too restrictive . Ordinary morality allows a fuller application of the idea than she does . Certainly in the version in which some evil is done to avoid a " clear and present " greater evil , the idea seems indispensable . Obviously the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes harming aggressors and wrongdoers , those who threaten or destroy not only life but other rights , then the resemblance of Arendt 's position to absolute morality is unexpected and undeniable . As for harming the innocent in order to spare a larger number of innocent , perhaps the only justification is a pseudojustification . From the point of view of an office-holder ( or anyone else who must act ) , calculations must be made . They must not pertain to the sacrifice of rights in daily policy-making : Rights are not to be abridged for the sake of benefit . But when policy does not abridge rights yet still significantly affects interests , then the calculations of the lesser evil are allowable ; indeed , exchange of harms and benefits ( of " pains " and " pleasures " ) may be allowable up to a certain point not readily specifiable . At the other extreme , when a decision is needed in circumstances of // extraordinary emergency or distress , the office-holder may well be right in believing that with " 100 victims we shall save a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another perspective than that of the office-holder ( or decider ) . That is the perspective of the innocent victims , for each of whom his life and rights are infinite in value and can not be entered as a finite sum into a calculation . The great Hobbesian teaching that a criminal is not morally obliged to cooperate with his punishers , and he may even be morally obliged to impede , resist , or escape them , is surely transferable to the seemingly less problematic relationship between an innocent person and his government . There is no way to tell a victim that he is wrong . Unless he gives way , he will be overpowered . But neither is the office-holder wrong . He stands for more than superior strength . The perspectives are mutually exclusive , but they are both right . If that is the case , there is only a pseudojustification for what the office-holder does ; but he must do it . Obviously , the possible existence of a duty to risk death or great loss for others ( say , as a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rightness of conscription is exemplary . It would seem that at crucial moments Arendt fails to make the case that ordinary morality almost completely excludes the idea of the lesser evil . Her scruples sometimes resemble those of an adherent to absolute morality . Better that greater evil happen than that a lesser be deliberately done . Such a sentiment may suit the individual 's response to totalitarianism , but elsewhere it may come too close to a self-protecting purity of the very kind that Arendt impeaches . Yet though she fights the lesser evil , and seems to have absolutist moments , she also fights absolute morality . That is the surprise . There are unresolved tensions in her thought about politics and morality . Sometimes , there even seems to be an impossible combination of absolutism and amoralism . The fact remains , however , that her main target is absolute morality . And what drives her to challenge it is not really any contrasting conception of political morality , but her whole philosophical commitment to wordliness . Arendt 's great ambition is to persuade us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute morality is almost always one or another kind of self-interest . In order to delineate her strategy , one must answer two questions . First , what does Arendt mean by absolute morality ? Second , what is the relation to self-interest ? The Two Kinds of Absolute Morality It is too abbreviated to say merely that absolute morality is purist about means and methods used and actions done to realize an end or purpose , in contrast to ordinary morality , which does not rule out any means a priori . Without using the phrase , Arendt distinguishes between two kinds of absolute morality . The first is Socratic and is summarized in the formulation from the Gorgias , which Arendt regularly cites : " It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong . " 10 The second is Christian , and teaches that one should treat everybody , including one 's enemies , with love . // By Arendt 's account , Socratic absolutism is the morality of conscience : the rules of conscience ... are ... entirely negative . They do not say what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not spell out certain principles for taking action ; they lay down boundaries no act should transgress . They say : Do n't do wrong . " She discusses Christian absolutism , on the other hand , as " active goodness , " an " active love of goodness , " as " living ... for others . " 12 The great example of such goodness is Jesus , who is also the great philosopher and teacher of it . He taught what he lived ; and what he lived manifested both a willingness to suffer wrong rather than do or return it , and a positive power to perform good works without regard to his own good or even self-preservation . Nowhere , however , does Arendt say that Jesus is a fuller Socrates . Despite apparent aspects of commonality between them , the very idea of what comprises " wrong " or " harm " or " evil " is not the same ? or at least not the same in every significant feature . Joining Socrates and Jesus is a refusal by each to do what ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the employment of certain means , when his self-preservation is at stake . But their reasons for such scruples are different , and so is the range . After all , Socrates served as a soldier . Although he never harmed the innocent , in some sense he " harmed " the enemy , even if not for the sake of his own individual preservation . We can not imagine Jesus using the sword , even for an impersonal end . So , even on the negative elements of absolute morality they differ . What positive element can we attribute to Socrates ? Perhaps none . For Arendt he is characteristically a negative figure , a no-sayer , an inhibitor . If a lover , he is a lover of wisdom rather than , as Jesus is , a lover of humanity . What matters for Arendt is that the two men , if imitated , if taken with the utmost seriousness , make political action as free initiative impossible . Absolute morality in both its forms is in a condition of unrelieved enmity with the world , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the encouragements and permissions that a less restrictive ordinary morality bestows on humanity for the sake of preparing our release into the glorious exertions of politics . Our primary concern is with Arendt 's critique of Socratic absolutism , the morality of conscience . Her treatment of Christian absolutism , the morality of goodness , appears earlier in Arendt 's work than her discussion of conscience , and it may be seen as a prefigurement of it . Christian Absolute Morality and its Vicissitudes Arendt has a startling reverence for the figure of Jesus . Her reflections on the quality of his goodness in The Human Condition are among her most searching explorations in moral psychology . Yet for all the tribute she pays Jesus in the form of a penetrating attention to his words and their meaning , she is moving in a direction that is not his , that would be opposite to his , if the Devil had not already taken possession of the opposite . Her work is in the service of the world , especially in the specific political sense of the world as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the world as a culture , as the setting for the public realm . The goodness of Jesus destroys the world ; the morality of love destroys the world . // There are a number of ways in which Christian absolute morality may be set in contradistinction to the world , especially the world understood as the public realm . Arendt 's way is quite her own . In order to show the incompatibility of Jesus ' goodness with worldliness , she dwells on a particular characteristic of deeds done in the spirit of such goodness . That characteristic is the self-unawareness of the doer while he is doing and after he has done the deed . The key formulation is , " Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth. " 13 She says : Goodness obviously harbors a tendency to hide from being seen or heard .... For it is manifest that the moment a good work becomes known and public , it loses its specific character of goodness , of being done for nothing but goodness ' sake .... Goodness can exist only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors ; whoever sees himself performing a good work is no longer good , but at best a useful member of society or a dutiful member of a church.14 Thus the very spirit of goodness shuns the world of human appearances . It is at war with all display and with the essence of the wish to display , namely , the wish to do deeds that are memorable . To be at war with display is to be at war with political action , the supreme ostentation . Not to know that one is doing praiseworthy deeds is incompatible with the political will to act memorably ? to act in the Greek sense especially , but not exclusively . One can not be in love with goodness and have any remaining desire or energy for the worldly life of political action . No one can have the character type suitable for both goodness and politics . Respect for goodness is disrespect for the world . One might think that such an interpretation of Christian absolutism is devious . What is Arendt doing ? Is she trying to persuade those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or some nontheistic equivalent ? that it is impossible to be good ? She quotes the words of Jesus , " Why tallest thou me good ? None is good , save one , that is , God . " 15 Has she not shown the full meaning of these words by her depiction of the dependence of goodness on unawareness , on unintentionality , almost on unconsciousness ? Is she not urging , consequently , that those who want to be good but know they can not be so on these terms stop trying and instead commit themselves to the world ? It seems that way . However , there is almost nothing as bad as the refusal to see that goodness and political action exclude each other and , instead , making the effort to combine them . Arendt reads Machiavelli as saying that " goodness that comes out of hiding and assumes a public role is no longer good , but corrupt in its own terms and will carry its own corruption wherever it goes . " 16 With that contention she is in complete sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France during the Revolution is that the source of terror is the determination to act in public out of what seems one or another form of love of humanity , out of either compassion or pity . There is no doubt that she is free of reactionary contempt for Robespierre and Saint Just . She sees them as still in thrall to Christian absolutism , rather than as bloodthirsty madmen . But she is unrelenting in condemning them for the hideous self-betrayal and betrayal of political life that they accomplished out of misplaced feelings and sentiments . // Arendt 's strategy is to show that self-interest is almost always the source of the wish to act in accordance with absolute morality . The one time it is not is when a person wishes to be good in imitation of Jesus . This is certainly not to be self-interested , provided one stays outside the political realm . If one knows what Jesus knew , he will never make a system out of his action . He will not think that goodness can ever be an attribute of a structure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes and goes invisibly ; it is episodic , irregular , miraculous , and altogether inappropriate for a citizen as citizen or an office-holder as office-holder . Goodness is only for everyday life , for relations where fixed roles do not prevail . It is for life that is hidden or , if not totally hidden , is so at least in comparison with political action , which by its very nature is manifest and is done to be known and recalled . Arendt says : Yet what love is in its own , narrowly circumscribed sphere , respect is in the larger domain of human affairs . Respect , not unlike the Aristotelian philia politike , is a kind of " friendship " without intimacy and without closeness ; it is a regard for this person from the distance which the space of the world puts between us , and this regard is independent of qualities which we may admire or of achievements which we may highly esteem . ' ( We call such respect , when it is publicly institutionalized , by the name of justice . ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be no taint of self-interest in goodness and no mortal danger from its practice . But goodness may helplessly create catastrophe . Her emblematic figure is not Jesus himself , but Melville 's Billy Budd , whose story Arendt reads as a parable on " What tragic and self-defeating enterprise the men of the French Revolution had embarked almost without knowing it . " The message of the parable is that " absolute goodness is hardly any less dangerous than absolute evil . " is Its danger derives from its nonhuman innocence ? a quality that Arendt does not attribute to Jesus . Provoked by Claggart , who is evil incarnate , Billy becomes murderously violent . Such goodness is perforce speechless , unpolitical , unmoderated . It can go from angelic serenity to the destructiveness of a natural force , as if all human relations were beyond it , or it was beyond them . Society can not contain it . Human relations , most especially political relations , reside in the middle ; between goodness and evil ; they are intermediate . Their essence is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances it makes possible . If Melville 's story is a pondering of the mysteries of the French Revolution by the creation of a figure larger than life almost a century later , the record itself of that Revolution is seen by Arendt as eloquent vindication of the contention that a politicized love of humanity sponsors appalling ruin in political life . Confronted with the spectacle of terror , not only in France but in Leninist Russia and elsewhere ? although in this context emphatically not the terror of Hitler and Stalin ? Arendt probes for the explanation . She finds it in the deformation of superior moral sensitivity . At times , she seems to be saying that there was something suspect in the initial sensitivity ; but preponderantly she seems to be saying that the revolutionaries were overcome by their sensitivity , // or their sensitivity was overcome by the strains put on it . Her analysis constitutes a coherent psychological story in which passions and sentiments work themselves out with a grotesque autonomy , as they sometimes do in Hegel 's Phenomenology of Mind . The revolutionaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arendt does not say of course that they were Christ-like . " Compassion and goodness may be related phenomena , but they are not the same.i19 She stresses , however , their superior and unusual moral sensitivity . Apart from their temperamental dispositions , they were prepared for their fate by their susceptibility to Rousseau 's instruction . She finds in him the philosophical source of one of the main kinds of wrong interest in the self : an obsessive attention to shifts and changes of mood and to the registry of experiences on the inner observer . She hates the pleasure taken in self-inspection , and derides the activity when she is not denying its reality and equating it with self-mystification . It is as if , for Rousseau , the world existed only so that one may have the raw material for the processes of the inner life . The most interesting inner life is one of conflict . Rousseau made it attractive to have a torn soul , a soul that ( by Arendt 's interpretation ) the observing self divides into a part that aspires to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is torn between the general will and the particular will . The torn soul is in conflict , not in the dialogue of two-in-one . The conflict " engenders passion in its twofold sense of intense suffering and intense passionateness. " 20 The outcome of the conflict should be a condition of selflessness , which Arendt defines as the ability of those who are not miserable to feel for those who are . This is not the active goodness that Jesus exemplified , but it is akin to it in a distorted way . There is distortion because all the while one is glad that one has an internal fight to wage , and therefore glad that the world presents abundant suffering so that one 's internal fight can take the fascinating form of overcoming strong tendencies to selfish indifference or to selfish enjoyment of privilege . Certainly Rousseau demonstrates this pattern in its fullness , even though the later revolutionaries under his spell may depart significantly from it while nevertheless showing aspects of it . A reduction of Arendt 's thesis on Rousseau is that he was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . From such a psychic configuration only corruption can ensue . Arendt 's specific analysis of Robespierre and Saint Just blends into her words on Rousseau and into that intense meditation on Billy Budd . She also introduces some thoughts on the Legend of the Grand Inquisitor . ( These two literary works she perceives as the deepest reflections on the French Revolution just because they are reflections on Jesus . ) The sense that persists throughout these feverish and tormenting pages of On Revolution is that the sensitive person who lets his sensitivity lead him into the life of political action will , when exposed to mass misery ? as he was in France and Russia ? change convulsively . His sensitivity crystallizes into compassion , which then changes into pity . Pity will show a capacity for cruelty greater than cruelty itself . It will turn cruelty into a system of cruelty , that is , a reign of terror . The distinction between compassion and pity is not lucidly maintained // throughout Arendt 's presentation . But basically , compassion is fellow-feeling , the suffering one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present before him . Pity is a generalized or abstract sentiment : It is " to be sorry without being touched in the flesh . " 21 Arendt suggests that pity and compassion may not be related at all ; but more typically , she sees pity as the perversion of compassion . Compassion can approach pity when the imagination of the revolutionary converts the suffering masses into one immense suffering individual . Both responses are destructive of human artifice and human limits , the spiritual essence of political action . The responses combined , in fact , to destroy the fragile but beautiful beginnings of direct communal democracy in the early days of the French Revolution , one of the rare genuine moments of political action at its ideal best in human history . The nub of the matter is that now stricken by the misery of the Parisian masses the sensitive souls , overwhelmed by compassion or its degraded relative pity , used violence on all those who stood in the way of their effort to ameliorate that misery . Clearly they abandoned their kinship to goodness by abandoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensed unprecedented ruthlessness . Of Robespierre , Arendt says , in words that carry much of the burden of her thought on the paradoxical relations between political action and superior morality sensitivity : Even if Robespierre had been motivated by the passion of compassion , his compassion would have become pity when he brought it out into the open where he could no longer direct it toward specific suffering and focus it on particular persons . What had perhaps been genuine passion turned into the boundlessness of an emotion that seemed to respond only too well to the boundless suffering of the multitude in their sheer overwhelming numbers . By the same token , he lost the capacity to establish and hold fast to rapports with persons in their singularity ; the ocean of suffering around him and the turbulent sea of emotion within him ... drowned all specific considerations , the considerations of friendship no less than considerations of statecraft and principle . ' Arendt insists that the alternative to pity , its political equivalent , is solidarity , just as the political equivalent of love is respect . Acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truly political individuals would " establish deliberately and , as it were , dispassionately a community of interest " with them.23 The sense of suffering can not guide solidary efforts ; only something like an extended sense of human honor or dignity can . Pity is the real adversary in Arendt 's theory . Its effects are ruinous of the possibility of genuine political action , and it always fails when it employs political coercion to ameliorate misery . She is adamant in the claim that poverty has only strictly economic and administrative solutions , never political ones . Furthermore , beyond the ruin and the failure , Arendt finds in the sense of suffering , in compassion and pity , the trigger for further extremisms of response , including the implacable urge to unmask the hypocrisy ( real or imputed or imagined ) of all those whose position in life automatically makes them suspect . They must be hiding something , some hostility to the Revolution , some resistance to the needs of the people , some incapacity really to feel the sufferings of others as though their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning desire to unmask may itself hide the very vices to be unmasked in others . Whom can the revolutionary trust to be sincere when his inveterate self-examination causes him to suspect himself ? As shown in Chapter 1 , Arendt holds that the insistence on disclosing the real self in the political realm is contradictory to the public nature of that realm . Nothing that is innermost in the heart can survive the transition to public disclosure without ineluctably undergoing an unintended transformation of some kind , whether a stylization , a falsification , or an inarticulate display that is either unrecognizable or destructive of further political relations . The heart is a dark place , Arendt says more than once , and light can not be thrown on it . What appears ? the words and deeds of political actors ? is necessarily impersonal , even though it is revelatory of something distinctive about each of the actors , just as a writer 's style is no outpouring of his heart but is nevertheless indicative of something distinctive about him . Pity at the end of its journey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its last stage of final despair . " 24 Arendt 's verdict is absolute : " Every effort to make goodness manifest in public ends with the appearance of crime and criminality on the political scene . " 25 She places us in the enclosure of Pascal 's words : He who would act the angel acts the beast . In Arendt 's moral psychology , then , compassion and pity are the fertile source of political crime and terror . A superior moral sensitivity predisposes toward compassion , if not toward pity . The impulse to project one 's compassion as one 's best and truest self onto the political world is indissolubly connected to a terrific self-absorption , a perhaps narcissistic interest in one 's inner condition . The most consuming interest of the compassionate soul is that there be enough suffering in the world to keep itself torn and hence continuously fascinating to itself as an internal spectacle . Obviously a long and patient answer is needed to Arendt 's indictment . The most insidious element in it is that compassion and pity express self-interest . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they find it . That is , they crave and devour the suffering of others . How does one respond ? One can certainly acknowledge the general point ; namely , that there is likely to be impurity in any deep human emotion or sentiment and ambiguity in any strong one . This acknowledgment also cuts the other way : Every ostensibly unlovely or hateful emotion or sentiment has something forgivable in it , if you just look long or probingly enough . But are compassion and pity simply disguised forms of self-interest , of that morbid self-fascination that Arendt excoriates ? Is that all or most of what there is to them ? Not continuously , but for the most part , Arendt says yes . To answer yes , however , is either unsubtle ( and that , Arendt never is ) or too ingenious ( and that , Arendt sometimes is ) . She is too ingenious in her pursuit of the true , perfect essence of politics . Encountering what she takes to be emotions and sentiments that weaken or cripple the will to be and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , to observe and applaud the performances of others , Arendt will try to discredit them . The direct way to discredit them is to say they lead to failure as judged by the intentions of those who act from them . The indirect way , the insidious and more powerful way , is to demonstrate that these emotions and sentiments // are not really what they seem . She revaluates them , with Nietzsche as the formal model , although not as the substantive , doctrinal model . In the process , she loses some plausibility because she makes too much of the role of compassion and pity in explaining revolutionary tragedy and too little of the role of undistorted selflessness in explaining compassion and pity . Second , the greatest amount of cruelty that has been done politically throughout human history has been done out a range of motives that does not include compassion and pity . Rather , the range includes such commonplace inducements to action as vanity , pride , arrogance , fear , greed , fanaticism , duty , adventurism , loyalty , restlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasoning cruelty . Those who died in the two world wars and in the labor camps and extermination camps of this ' century were not killed by compassion and pity that had turned political or by misplaced love of humanity . This number of dead far exceeds the number killed during and right after leftist revolutions ? even if the attribution of irrepressible compassion and pity to the revolutionaries is correct to some important degree . That perhaps the most searching and original theorist of political horror in the twentieth century could , as if in self-forgetfulness , accuse compassion and pity as the sponsors of more cruelty than cruelty itself is bizarre , aberrant . Words that are less strong will not do . Even after we absorb Arendt 's concept of the banality of evil and see , if we do , that thoughtlessness rather than an intoxicated sadism was principally behind the day-to-day administration of totalitarian terror , we still do not find that either compassion or pity played any part . She herself says at one point in Eichmann in Jerusalem that the problem for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much their conscience as the animal pity by which all normal men are affected in the presence of physical suffering . " 26 That fleeting comment is not enough to deter one from finding an inexplicable excess in Arendt 's basic presentation . That revolutionaries may have , time after time , chosen to sacrifice the incipient expressions of direct participatory democracy ? the reassertion or transmutation of the spirit of the polis in a modern framework ? to the hopeless struggle against material misery does not make them history 's worst criminals . They are history 's worst criminals if we think that the only value that counts is freedom as political action , and that its destruction is the worst crime . But its destruction is not the worst crime , nor does Arendt ever say that it is . The slaughter of innocents is ; or perhaps the slaughter of the guilty , or any slaughter , is the worst crime . You do not speak out of compassion or pity when you say that , but out of feelings more common . The third point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies of raw passions ( including compassion ) or self-induced emotions ( including pity ) in political life , the moral energy that these passions and emotions provide political actors seems indispensable . Without them , any ameliorative movement in human affairs could barely get started . The pressure often begins with the tenderness of the few : Arendt is clear on that point . If later there are more massive pressures , they are instigated and set in motion by that sense of suffering ? care for the suffering of others ? which Arendt reproaches . Terror and rage may follow , and when they do , the effects // are enormous and dramatic . But there is also the long-term and quietly maintained labor to better the human lot . There is no strictly economic and administrative solution , despite what Arendt says . It must be undergirded by political will , which in turn is formed and sustained by many things , and surely one of them is the sense of suffering . I do not know with what warrant she says that , " As a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly conditions in order to ease human suffering . " 27 The hope is to find ways of disciplining that sense , of making it suitable for public appearance , without diminishing its efficacy . Also , solidarity is not the political equivalent of the sense of suffering . The corruptions of solidarity are great . No doubt , following Arendt , a positive appeal to human honor or dignity is worthier than a naked materialist humanitarianism that would settle too easily for bodily ease and security while letting everything else go , including participatory freedom . But can not that point be made without impeaching the sense of suffering ? Next , when Arendt grants that something other than self-interest lies behind compassion and pity , she is expecially incisive on the harm that the men and women of compassion and pity do themselves when they enter the political realm as violent revolutionaries and radical reformers . In circumstances of great risk , uncertainty , and resistance , the best , most noble traits may wither or change into the worst , most base traits . Only lilies fester ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who were always low , so appalling is the discrepancy between the original and the latter state . But if the sensitive stay cloistered , what meaning could their moral sensitivity have ? The ingredients of tragedy are present when the best natures undertake action under the most dangerous circumstances . Arendt includes the danger to the revolutionaries themselves : the psychological and moral danger . If only she had lamented it more and had not placed so much weight on the unconditionally unpolitical quality of their native disposition . Last , we may grant that Christian absolutism , goodness in strict imitation of Jesus , is essentially nonpolitical , indeed antipolitical . But it is a miscalculation to sever it utterly from political life . One would insist , overriding Arendt 's ambiguity , that Christian goodness is not only related to compassion , but is its ultimate source , historically and existentially . She seems to say as much when she remarks that the deepest thought about the French Revolution is thought about Jesus , the thought poetically luminous in Melville and Dostoyevsky . Christian absolutism changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the power to engender lesser ideals that could be realized , but though lesser , they were still profoundly different from those that preceded them . Somehow the tension must be kept alive : Christian absolutism is not of this world , but the world can not do without it in some " demythologized , " " revaluated , " attenuated condition . It can not do without the politicized love of humanity . Let us now look at negative or Socratic absolutism and its politics of conscience . Socratic Absolute Morality and its Vicissitudes " Politics of conscience " is not an exact phrase and does not refer to a narrow // range of activity . Nevertheless , common opinion includes within its scope such modes of political response as passive resistance , evasion , or noncompliance ; " blowing the whistle " ; principled resignation from office ; conscientious objection ; selective conscientious objection ; selective secret lawbreaking ; civil disobedience ; disobedience of an order ; massive nonviolent endeavors . Each of these phrases , in turn , does not lend itself to tidy or unambiguous use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common element ; but conscience , too , is various in its meaning . Yet for all the indefiniteness , we would probably agree that the solitary individual , or the succession of like-minded individuals , or the organized group , or the spontaneous group , or the movement , who or which engages in any of these modes is saying no , is refusing to go along with public authority or public officials on the basis of some overriding or especially compelling moral reason . ( Perhaps some kinds of official lawbreaking could be seen as examples of the politics of conscience as well . ) One could exclude all kinds of politics in which there is no restriction on the means . Violent revolution , guerrilla warfare , and protracted resistance are not suitably included in the politics of conscience , nor is " incremental " politics , since the end has no special moral urgency . The politics of conscience may occur under all forms of government . Under repressive regimes it may be a heroic undertaking . Arendt admires such heroism without reservation . Her analysis makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal is selective ( to use a word that appears in the names of some of the modes ) ; that is , when it takes place in a context of acquiescence in or approval of the political system as a whole ( ordinarily , a democratic constitution ) . Although Arendt is silent on the issue , part of the moral pain the conscientious may feel comes from the contrast between selective refusal and general acceptance , as the larger part comes , naturally , from the deeds of office-holders . Henry David Thoreau , who figures in Arendt 's analysis as a model of selective conscientious resistance , is not easy to describe . He protested slavery when the Constitution allowed it . He was therefore not simply selective in his refusal : " Its the state 's very Constitution is the evil . " 28 He said that if a revolution over taxes was justifiable , all the more so was one to abolish slavery . If slaves were morally allowed to use violence to become free , the free could use violence to help them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , too . Hence his refusal to pay the head tax can be seen as an individual act of nonviolent revolution . Yet Thoreau had no ambition for a new constitution . He would have been satisfied with the Constitution once it had been amended to abolish slavery . Indeed , the spirit of the Constitution enabled his resistance to its radical deficiency . He is a mixed case , but we will take him as Arendt does ? selective in his refusal . Of particular concern is Arendt 's thinking on one of the modes of the politics of conscience ; civil disobedience in America . However , to study civil disobedience , in particular to study Arendt 's thought on civil disobedience , including her confrontation with Thoreau and his essay on civil disobedience , is to involve oneself with almost all modes of the politics of conscience . That is so because she offers an overall political critique of conscience , at least within the framework of a nonrepressive form of government . It is highly profitable to // follow her thought on this matter , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does she help to perplex and enrich our views on civil disobedience and on almost all modes of the politics of conscience , she leads us on to the overall theory of political legitimacy . In her profound unconventionality she disturbs some of the standard ways of thinking about conscience . A preliminary point is that a strong connection exists between Socratic conscience and Christian goodness . The latter not only sponsors the revolutionary and reformist politics of compassion and pity but also has come to reinforce the Socratic sponsorship of the characteristically negative politics of conscience . This affinity to Socratic conscience is probably more true to the spirit of the Gospels than any political activism . There is thus a Christian conscience as well as a Socratic one . Arendt deals only casually with Christian conscience . She tends to dismiss it as merely subjective , as if its invocation were always a private claim to have God 's special inspiration . The Christian conscience , by this account , is anarchical because it always commands that we should obey God , not man ; yet God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not do this matter justice ; she slights both the reference to scriptural authority and the frequently universalist claims present in assertions of Christian conscience . But these shortcomings in her analysis need not concern us , except as a small sign of a larger ambition ? to impeach the kind of conscience that she identifies with Socrates . Her work implies that in the modern age those who act out of conscience are , knowingly or not , acting in imitation of him . Arendt presents an immediate obstacle to the usual way of considering civil disobedience by saying throughout her essay , simply called " Civil Disobedience " ( which first appeared in The New Yorker , September 12 , 1970 , and later reprinted in Crises of the Republic ) , that it is not properly seen as one of the modes of the politics of conscience . This essay marked her abandonment of her earlier view that active civil disobedience is a mode of the politics of conscience . And it was a notable contribution to the discussion of what only a few years ago seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . One could say that there was an efflorescence of writing on civil disobedience , 30 and a good deal of it was faithful enough to its requirements to remain permanently relevant to thinking about fundamental questions of political theory . The writing keeps its freshness . In the midst of this efflorescence , in the midst actually of vehement contention , Arendt proceeded to defend civil disobedience . This fact should not be passed over too lightly . Indeed , there are probably fewer inhibitions in Arendt 's essay than in many other works that were written to justify civil disobedience . In fact , her lack of equivocation is somewhat surprising . One did not think to connect her praise of the early moments of revolutionary spontaneity in On Revolution ( published seven years before ) to her praise of those who were now committing civil disobedience . One thought that Arendt owed student activists some acknowledgment . After all , they seemed to come closer to fulfilling her theoretical expectations concerning political action than anyone else did.31 But of course not all student activism was civilly // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have extended to celebrating civil disobedience . Yet that is what Arendt did . Only , she was emphatic in severing civil disobedience from conscience . So that if one could feel surprise at the very fact of her advocacy , one had also to feel surprise at her conception of civil disobedience . One can still feel surprise , or at least a strong initial disapproval , even though one can now see that there was something inevitable about her repudiation of conscience , especially as a continuous instigation to protracted activity . Such repudiation is the affirmation of politics . More narrowly , the affirmation of civil disobedience purged of the infiltration of conscience is the affirmation of politics . Her strategy is to show that Socrates and his American heir , Thoreau , are not to be seen as teachers of civil disobedience . As men of conscience , they are inactive until they feel compelled to be reactive . But civil disobedience is not mere reaction , but genuine action . Arendt also traces conscience to an unexpected root . She thus aims to place the prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevance to civil disobedience . It is not for any deed of Socrates that Arendt makes him the great archetype of conscience . Her analysis does not have its center in Socrates ' conscientious dissent as a councillor in the Athenian democracy ; or his conscientious refusal to execute an order from the Thirty tyrants that would have resulted in the unjust death of an individual ; or his hypothetical refusal to desist from philosophical conversation ; or his conscientious acceptance of an unjust death sentence in preference to an illegal escape . Her interest in him is directed instead at the formula he enunciates in the Gorgias , " It is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong , " or " It is better to be wronged than to do wrong . " and to the reasons he gives to support it . All his conscientious acts she claims , are subsumable under the formula of the Gorgias : in these cases he risked , then accepted , wrongfully inflicted death rather than inflict harm or wrong or evil on either individuals or the laws.32 One must notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to have to die was to be harmed , and he also said that a good man could not be harmed . To recollect these things is not of course to impugn his courage . What matters to Arendt is the naked proposition and the supporting reasons . Just as Arendt works over compassion and pity so that they come to reflect a convoluted self-interest , so she traces Socratic absolutism to another kind of self-interest . She never tries to " revaluate " the love that Jesus had : She turns against only the derivatives , perversions , or semblances of such love . But she addresses herself reductively to the Socratic formula itself . And once again , when she criticizes it , she does not content herself with making the conventional objections against it . She certainly does not abstain from making them : She repeats the point that it is only against comparatively decent adversaries that anyone less heroic than Socrates would dare try to put some version or other of the Socratic formula into practice . But that point is only incidental . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fill out and justify the formula . It is as if tracing it to its source was sufficient to analyze it and demystify it . Much of the energy behind Arendt 's impeachment and demystification comes from the disinclination to act , the // aversion to full-bodied citizenship , the turning away from the world , which a commitment to the Socratic formula signifies . She is battling a character type more than a doctrine . To persuade young Americans that they misconceive themselves as civil disobedients when they claim they act at the behest of conscience , Arendt tries to show what conscience really is . She takes the chance that those who say they act at its behest may not initially recognize it or themselves in her analysis . Her claim is that we know what conscience is only if we go back to Socrates and if we see Thoreau , a hero to civil disobedients , as reenacting the Socratic pattern . How , then , does she expound the Socratic idea and connect it to self-interest ? The self-interest Arendt sees here is much less compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The key is found in a remark by Socrates in the Gorgias : It would be better for me that my lyre or a chorus I directed should be out of tune and loud with discord , and that multitudes of men should disagree with me rather than that I , being one , should be out of harmony with myself and contradict me , 33 On this remark Arendt builds her exposition.34 Because Socrates thinks , because he is constantly holding an internal dialogue , because that dialogue concerns among other things his own past conduct , he knows that if he were to do wrong to another he would suffer the merited pain of self-reproach . Such pain is what makes it impossible to live harmoniously with himself . Since he is double , he can be one only on the terms of absolute morality . Arendt 's sense of Socrates could be translated into the proposition : It is better for me , because it is less painful , to suffer the wrong that others do me than the pain I inflict on myself when I wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Socrates refused to carry out orders he received as an office-holder or citizen . At the risk of harm to himself , he refused in one case to harm the innocent and in the other to cooperate with a circumvention of legal process . He engaged in two acts of direct civil disobedience , disobeying a substantively unjust act of state , not in indirect civil disobedience , where the disobeyed law or command is not unjust in itself , but related in an ancillary or symbolic way to injustice . The additional assumption , found in the first two books of the Republic , must be that wronging others includes retaliation in kind or in some other way against those who have wronged you as a private person or individual citizen.3 ' So that Socratic conscience in its fullest sense entails moral absolutism , the absolute prohibition of harming others where harm is seen as any private or individual retaliation ; or as involvement in unjust or irregular public retaliation ( that is , unjust or irregular state-imposed punishment ) . At least this is what harm seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two books of the Republic . It is not what it becomes in the Gorgias : impairment of the capacity to be virtuous . Arendt 's thesis thus proceeds without reference to the insidious change effected in the rendering of Socratic absolutism in the Gorgias . By extending the notion of harm to include what ordinary morality defines as merited pain , Socratic conscience bars the effort to use just laws , or to act // within them , in order to settle scores or to act punitively . The prohibition of private retaliation is distinct from a prohibition of private lawlessness . In sum , Socratic conscience in its fullest sense goes beyond the requirements of ordinary morality in two ways . First , it prohibits more acts , and second , it asks for the readiness to be harmed ( as the world understands harm ) even unto death , rather than violate the prohibitions . It is of crucial importance to see , however , what Arendt overlooks . In regard to the two acts of refusal in the Apology , apart from the general formulations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplified only by harming the innocent or those threatened by improper legal procedure . Absolute morality here has no content beyond ordinary morality , and it has only one differentiating characteristic : Its practitioner risks extreme harm , as the world understands harm . The practitioner is holding the state only to the standard of ordinary morality . He never asks of it that it be prepared to be self-sacrificing , that it abstain from the lesser evil , or that it extend the notion of harm as he does , for his own conduct , when he refuses to retaliate against personal injustice by escaping his capital punishment . In Arendt 's analysis the self-interest of the Socratic person is thus the avoidance of self-reproach . His harm is internal , and only he can inflict it on himself . He says to himself such things as , If I did what I am expected or told to do , I could not live with myself ; or , Unless I make known my objection to a certain policy or condition , I would sicken . By Arendt 's definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when the result of his obedience or acceptance would be involvement in the initiation or continuance of some great wrong , some atrocity , not some commonplace imperfection . His disobedience or noncooperation withdraws him from the wrong and thus diminishes its strength by that much . He is characteristically interested only in not doing wrong , in not transgressing certain limits . In the absence of atrocity or its possibility , he remains inactive . As a citizen , he rarely acts ; and when he acts , all he does is say no , and then carry through on that response as economically as possible . Withdrawn from wrongdoing , he does not organize resistance to it . Although Arendt calls him the good man , he is of course not the actively good man who imitates Jesus in private life . Let us be clear that Arendt never makes the mistake of likening the Socratic person who usually abstains from action to Pontius Pilate.36 Pilate was one who gave in too easily to the wrong he could have prevented , and he sought by a ritual gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express and secure his innocence . He is a symbol of either ineffectuality or cowardly irresponsibility joined to a concern to be understood by others as guiltless . However , Arendt does say that it matters less to the Socratic person that wrong is being done than that he can believe that he is not responsible for it ; that the possible pain of self-reproach is more important to him than the actual pain of others.37 But I do not see how anyone could say that he would feel intolerable pain if he harmed others , unless he had an exceptional sensitivity to the pain of others . This sensitivity is independent of his own pain and hence of his own self-interest , no matter how rarefied . When Arendt discusses those few who self-sacrificingly refused collaboration with the Nazi policy of // extermination , she says that their refusal stemmed from their fear of self-abhorrence . Although , in that context , she does not suggest anything but admiration for their refusal , she nevertheless diminishes their heroism by concentrating so exclusively on their inner dialogue . She does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , apart from the role they were called on to play and refused to play . Arendt does not mean us to see Socratic self-interest as a taint . But no doubt those who initially admire Socrates would probably see it that way if they were persuaded that Arendt 's analysis was correct . There is also no doubt that self-sacrificing Socratic persons do often refer to their internal disquiet when justifying a conscientious act of disobedience or noncooperation . It is implausible , however , to convert Socrates ' statement into a sufficient psychological account , as if the determining motive in every real case of conscientious resistance at whatever cost to the resister were dread of having to account for oneself to oneself . It is more likely that where this dread , this prospective guilt , is felt acutely it coexists with a powerful inclination to transgressive behavior that often prevails even if in displaced or sublimated fashion , and that paralysis , not resistance , may result . There is something more than odd in suggesting that those who show the courage to say no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible future pain than to the suffering and wrong they see or anticipate . Once again , Arendt is too ingenious . Or one might rather say that she has not been ingenious enough , because she does not allow for the fact that a proponent of Socratic conscience ? perhaps Socrates himself ? might try to seduce us into accepting his position by an appeal to refined self-interest , while he himself is unmoved by such a consideration and expects anyone else who comes to live by such a conscience eventually to see through this initial appeal . It is hard not to believe that for Socrates himself the passional source of his absolutism was something akin to samaritan neighborliness : not love of all , but perhaps sorrow at their vulnerability . ( If he loved all , he loved as a teacher loves students , not as a mother loves her children or a priest his flock . ) This passion was perhaps guaranteed by unworldliness in a conventional sense : He found the goods and prizes of the world to be not much , found life itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Symposium . To lose all , therefore ? to be harmed as the world understands harm ? hardly signified . The good person can not be harmed . Of course anyone with Arendt 's commitment to the world must fear this distaste . Perhaps the natural bond ? if that is what it is ? between Socratic conscience and unworldliness ( not otherworldliness ) should be the real object of demystifying analysis . But then again , there need be no such bond , in the case of others who bear a Socratic conscience . The notion of conscience as self-interest incorporates yet another element that Arendt uses to question conscience further . She suggests that what one person finds he can not live with , another may find morally permissible or even required . Subjectivity is intrinsic to Socratic conscience : It contains no principle that can be " generalized.i38 Arendt 's failure to put Socrates ' two acts of refusal at the center of her analysis misleads her here . In his defense of // these acts , Socrates invoked nothing beyond either the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy . His reference to his inner voice adds nothing to the simple assertion that Athenian office-holders ( tyrants or democrats ) were acting unconstitutionally . That his disobedience may have struck his conformist contemporaries as odd shows that he was an infinitely better democrat than they . Naturally , that his kind of disobedience was unusual or even unprecedented indicates a rare moral energy . There are times when extraordinary risks have to be taken for ordinary morality , for the avoidance of surplus evil . He was a true " subject , " but that did not make his acts the emanation of something subjective . Arendt takes some of the general impeachment back when she says that the Socratic kind of self-interest is rare . The remark is all the more telling for being so casual . But it is precisely the Socratic person who is least likely to be consoled by what he or she would take to be flattery . Such a person must wish either that the concept of self-interest is being misused when it is made to apply to the dread of self-reproach ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share this self-interest to some degree or other , and that to lack it altogether is to lack one of the constitutive features of being human . Arendt makes conscience at once idiosyncratic and self-interested , and this transformation must be resisted for the sake of truth , as well as for the sake of the prestige of Socratic conscience . Given that Socrates made such demands on himself , can we say that he has any place in a discussion of civil disobedience ? Arendt insists that he can not be a model for the civilly disobedient , even though many think he can be.39 She wants to remove him from people 's thought on civil disobedience . Yet he has a place , which is roughly analogous to that which Jesus has in the field of continuously ameliorative endeavors . Socrates has a place in thought about civil disobedience , not only in thought about " personal responsibility under dictatorship . " He is a sponsor of the will to say no , to resist complicity in the oppression of the innocent , especially in a democratic society that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalized atrocity or a pattern of atrocious policy . He is major for the democratic ideal in a way that another classical no-sayer , Antigone , is not . In dealing with Socrates on his two explicit occasions of refusal , we are not dealing with the clash between two bodies of law or between higher law and lesser law ; just as we are not dealing with any absolutist extension of the notion of harm or wrong . The content of his two refusals are within the bounds of ordinary morality . We are faced with a man who is adamant in his compliance with the spirit of the laws of the democracy , the spirit that only democracy then aspired to make practical . He stands for the idea that the democracy should not forget its difference from other forms and proceed to imitate their systemic cruelty . As for the tyrants , he reminded them of the real meaning of the system they had for the moment abolished . ( That democratic Athens was cruel in its policy of imperialism was , in its way , hideously inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Socrates of the Apology and the Crito , the " only " Socrates relevant to this discussion . ) Socrates differs from modern civil disobedients in one significant way : He is // willing to risk harm unto death to avoid participation in the harming of the innocent or of those whose guilt will not be properly determined . This aspect of absolute morality , of Socratic conscience , is present only in an attenuated form among civil disobedients . They are willing , certainly , to endure some punishment . However , the punishment is often but not always slight , and it is known beforehand to be slight . But otherwise Socrates is a model . To challenge Arendt 's imputation of rarefied self-interest to him , and to others of self-sacrificing conscience , is to try to retain him as model , and to retain conscience as a more than marginal political concept . Conscience and Civil Disobedience Examining civil disobedience in America , consider the antislavery and antiwar movements . Consider those who engaged in direct civil disobedience ? breaking laws that had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War , and with war-related taxes and draft induction during the Vietnam War ? and in such indirect civil disobedience as acts of trespass during the Vietnam War . ( I exclude civil rights protest , as Arendt does , because it involved breaking laws that were invalid , or presumably so . ) We find , as Arendt knows , refusals defended on grounds of conscience . What is this conscience ? It is a moral seriousness similar to that of Socrates : the intensity of people who ? to borrow an idea from Erik Erikson 's Young Man Luther ? meant it ; 40 who tried to stay true to what everyone professed but office-holders failed to practice , with the acquiescence or active support of the majority ; and who were willing to risk varying degrees of punishment . Arendt and others have distinguished the civil disobedient from the conscientious objector in the technical war-related sense . If there is any basis to the distinction , it must be that the conscientious objector is usually a pacifist ? to leave aside selective conscientious objectors , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a general principle , but it is not a principle accepted by all . In fact , he asks the state to act toward other states in accordance with the Socratic principle in one of its statements : Never inflict harm , no matter what is at stake , even your own self-preservation . That is , the state should never engage in even public , regular , defensive retaliation . The principle in Christian terms is resist not evil ( especially when resistance means killing ) , without necessarily going the length of loving even your enemies . The conscientious objector in his pacifism subscribes to an extreme form of negative absolute morality ? more extreme than Socrates because it is applied to interstate relations . Civil disobedients do not . They appeal instead either to the common sense of atrocity , and hence to the condemnation that ordinary morality ( not only absolute morality ) would pass on the condition or policy ; or to the spirit of the Constitution when some actual feature of it taints it ; or to the common sense of constitutional violation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free of the taint of injustice . Ordinary morality may allow certain categories of public action under exigent circumstances , while absolute morality prohibits them under all circumstances . But ordinary morality retains a requirement of proportionality // that makes the concept of atrocity something other than an arbitrary term of disfavor ; and ordinary morality is committed to the defense of the absolute rights of all . One did not have to be an absolutist to oppose slavery or the war in Vietnam . One had only to reject surplus evil . One had only to take seriously what others said they believed but chose not to act on . They did not mean it . Conscience as meaning it is not the same as subjectivity . Of course there are cases in American judicial and political history when individuals or groups were radically subjective in their invocation of conscience . That is , they claimed some privilege or exemption on grounds that cut them off entirely from general moral principles available to the whole society . They maintained that they were special in their lineage or inspiration ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought tolerance , not full acceptance . They did not expect to convert many others , if any at all . At most , they may have thought they would be granted some larger vindication in the future . The possessed individual or the ingrown sect fits this rough description . But surely Thoreau did not ; nor did those in antiwar and student movements . When one of them said something like , I could not live with myself if I went along , or did not make my objection known , he or she was saying , in effect , no one could if they gave the matter some further thought . Characteristically , there was an appeal to a general principle , not to a private scruple , and that principle was one that was supposedly accepted by all and was therefore neither esoteric nor novel . The appeal to the people , in Thoreau 's formulation , is from them to themselves . Then , too , meaning it is not exhaustively defined by depth of feeling . Segregationists broke the law out of depth of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their appeal to conscience ( if indeed they made it ) was as justified as that of those who broke the law to protest the Vietnam War is absurd . Political conscience is inseparable from principle , from justice . The inwardness that goes with political conscience is not subjectivity , but self-examination . Its purpose is to be as certain as possible that one is not mistaken or obdurate . The process can not be like what Arendt describes as imagining the thinking of others , because too many others seem not to be thinking . It is , rather , independence or thinking or judging for oneself , 41 but always in accordance with the principles commonly professed . No matter how many individuals come together to commit a joint act of civil disobedience , each must be understood as having first thought things through for himself or herself , especially when individuals serially commit direct acts of civil disobedience . When practitioners of civil disobedience insist on their nonviolence , they do not have to do so in behalf of absolute morality . It seems that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nonviolence . Their sense of moral limits that calls forth their resistance to office-holders also governs their choice of methods . They are not revolutionaries or criminals . They may of course be inclined to nonviolence out of prudence or , contrastingly , out of some affinity to pacifist absolutism . But neither of these two motivations is conceptually appropriate for the normal range of civil disobedience . In sum , the appeal to conscience that civil disobedients typically make is not rightly understood as a result of a special self-interest , nor is it dependent on // the two imputed accompaniments of that self-interest : first , the assertion of subjectivity against the generality , and second , the rejection of ordinary morality in favor of absolute morality . ( Although the pacifist conscientious objector holds to absolute morality , he , too , should not be seen as driven by a special self-interest or as substituting subjectivity for reasoned dissent . ) To speak of the civil disobedient as a conscientious person is only to say that the person is , at least for the while , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally than most other people . One could concede that if a civil disobedient put the matter in this way he or she may strike some as self-righteous or vain and therefore infected by a feeling worse than the special kind of self-interest that Arendt makes so much of . Indeed , the worst criticism that could be made of this way of looking at civil disobedience is suggested by Justice Thurgood Marshall in his opinion for the Supreme Court in Gillette v. United States , 1971 . The case dealt with the claim of an individual to be exempt from a particular war on the ground that the war ( the Vietnam war ) was unjust . Marshall wrote : The fear of the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service , apparently , is that exemption of objectors to particular wars would weaken the resolve of those who otherwise would feel themselves bound to serve despite personal cost , uneasiness at the prospect of violence , or even serious moral reservations or policy objections concerning the particular conflict . ' Underlining serious moral reservations emphasizes the point that some may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition but think that the principle of equality requires them to defer , in some disputable cases , if not in all , to the laws and policies that emanate from a legitimate because constitutionally democratic procedure. t3 They , too , may try to invoke Socrates . After all , he conscientiously obeyed an unjust democratic command ? his death sentence . But they would not strengthen their case . His obedience made him the agent of a wrong done to himself , not to another . They have a case without the help of Socrates . This is the most troubling aspect of describing civil disobedients as meaning it , as morally more serious than the majority . The conscientious obeyer may usually be mistaken in ranking obedience to the law as morally more necessary than dissent on any specific policy or condition , especially when he is asked to be the direct agent of what he suspects is injustice . But that he is mistaken need not diminish his moral seriousness . If only out of respect for the conscientious obeyer , the civil disobedient ( the conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks himself morally compelled to break the law even while the conscientious obeyer may feel obliged in general to obey laws and policies enacted by a legitimate government . His good faith toward the conscientious obeyer also requires that he show courage , so that his act not be seen as privileged self-exemption from danger or from personal defilement . Courage can be shown either in the acceptance of a duty equivalent to the one foresworn , or the acceptance of punishment , or perhaps the acceptance of physical risk or unpleasantness in the very acts of disobedience . At the same time , there are limits to this argument . It can not be right that one who refuses to be a direct agent of injustice deserves punishment . He is wronged by being // punished , even though the punishment comes from a legitimate government . But , " It is better to be wronged than to do wrong . " Civil Disobedience and Group Action If Arendt 's critique of civil disobedience as a mode of the politics of conscience is open to doubts , her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience is rather flat and uninspiring . It is curious that the one kind of public politics of the modern age ? apart from debate on a new constitution or the extraordinary occurrence of spontaneous democracy in the early moments of revolution ? that contains a good deal of the existential meaning which Arendt finds in the politics of the city-state should elude her powers of vivification . She does celebrate the public happiness that members of the student movement and the antiwar movement found in the rediscovery of participatory politics , including their acts of civil disobedience . She thus establishes a link between her ideal conception of politics and the recent manifestations . Accompanying this motif , however , is a different dominant line of argument . Arendt works to conceptualize civil disobedience as pressure politics : We are dealing with organized minorities , who stand against assumed inarticulate , though hardly " silent , " majorities , and I think it is undeniable that these majorities have changed in mood and opinion to an astounding degree under the pressure of the minorities.44 She is clear that the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-or group-interest in the economic sense , and hence it is to be distinguished from the usual lobbying . Concerning the usual lobbying , Arendt speaks with extreme harshness in On Revolution , comparing the tactics of the lobbyists with blackmail and equating economic interest with private interest pushed in disregard of the legitimate interests of others.45 But her tone changes in the essay on civil disobedience . She now is willing to see economic interest and pressure groups as voluntary associations , as the free and regular cooperation of individuals who act together for a common purpose . That they are economically interested and hence automatically foreign to the nature of ideal politics becomes less salient in Arendt 's analysis . They formally resemble civil disobedients , and the formal resemblence decreases the relevance of the substantive differences , especially the difference between acting for an interest and acting for an opinion . Arendt is trying to Americanize civil disobedience , and in the course of doing so she Americanizes herself . If only for the occasion , she tolerates the pressure politics of economic interests , as if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to gain respectability for the civil disobedients . The cost of that effort , however , is to reduce and flatten both the actual practice and the self-theorization of those who committed civil disobedience . In her flight from what she holds to be basically unpolitical , the motivation of conscience , Arendt hastens toward an understanding of politics ? politics as pressure in behalf of economic interest ? which one would have thought she // could never countenance . But she seems to prefer the latter even to the former . Conscience is even more remote than economic interest from true politics . At least , however , she preserves some distance between the groups of civil disobedients and the other voluntary associations . The former represent an opinion that they are willing to act for , even to break the law for . Indeed , she detects in the antiwar movement the intimations of an acceptable opinion on the justifiable recourse to civil disobedience , and she proceeds to fill out those intimations in a highly suggestive manner . Roughly , Arendt says that the lawbreaking that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Naturally , the example it gives to the potentially criminal is unfortunate , and it makes it all the easier for an unscrupulous man like Spiro Agnew to lump together the civilly disobedient and the criminally disobedient . Apart from the disturbance of that basic order which any society must have , civil disobedience is problematic because it takes place in a polity in which the systematic provision for dissent creates consent to the basic rules , the Constitution as a whole , and hence to the laws made under it . Arendt scorns those who think that the majority of the people actually rule in a representative democracy . She has no patience with the effort to derive a general obligation to obey all laws from what she calls the " fictitious " consent of universal suffrage.46 At best , the people rule their representatives , in the sense of setting some limits on their conduct . She uses a formulation to describe the constitutional monarchies of the eighteenth century that I believe informs her thought on twentieth-century representative democracies . She says that the social groupings represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch , who , in an enlightened despotism , was supposed to act as " a single enlightened person against many private interests , " whereby it was understood that in a " limited monarchy " these bodies had the right to voice grievances and to withhold consent.47 In modern times the civil disobedients are precisely those who guard the limits on the conduct of office-holders ; those whose voiced grievances have gone unheeded and who withhold consent to unconstitutional policies . Their obligation is to the Constitution as a whole , which is a codification of the limits . When those in authority attack the Constitution , and when judicial review is denied , citizens may apply irregular pressures , including lawbreaking , to defend it . She does not say that when those in authority attack the Constitution , as say Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon did , they have forfeited their offices and hence their enactments have lost validity and obligatoriness . Rather , in present-day political circumstances , when the usual procedures are futile , irregular politics will tend to be the most efficacious . Civil disobedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to dissent is fundamental.48 Arendt goes so far as to say in The Life of the Mind that " disobedience is the most common and least harmful mode ofdissent.i49 The matter could be put in the form of a seeming paradox : Civil disobedience is most in the spirit of constitutional democracy , yet it is supposed to be needed there least . Arendt thus offers what could be described as a purely political way of // regarding civil disobedience and perhaps some other modes of the politics of refusal . But there are a fair number of difficulties with it . On its own terms , the characterization of representative democracy as not really democratic at all needs to be qualified . If in broad outlines the people rule ; if their rule of their representatives means that they choose office-holders in such a way as to guide policy ; if in other ways like town meetings , party caucuses , and the powers of referendum , initiative , and recall , they approach some regular , direct participation , then the idea of consent , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , must be looked at again . This consideration need not lead to stricter standards for justifying civil disobedience . It may simply make the task of conscientious scrupulousness , political selfexamination , more extensive . Arendt 's theory should not , however , be taken on its own terms . A purely political way of regarding civil disobedience is not in accord with the experiential meaning of civil disobedience in modern America , and probably elsewhere . Her account is anemic . It appears all the more anemic just because she makes every effort to stress the robustness and participatory and solidary joy of the civil disobedients . It strenuously misses one large fact ? the moral outrage felt and expressed at the atrocities committed by the United States in Vietnam . That the war was against the spirit of the laws , that it was surely anticonstitutional if not formally unconstitutional , is all to the point . But the judgment of " unconstitutional " bespeaks dispassion , a great virtue , and one that even may inspire passionately direct action . It may even be that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one can get over the dissonance created by combatting a higher illegality with a lesser one ? think of those who want to allow illegally obtained evidence into courts of law there still remains something spectral about the sense of unconstitutionality as a sufficient motivation to extraordinary citizenly action when the object of protest is a war of cruelty . Other matters will of course lend themselves more suitably to the kind of constitutional emphasis Arendt advocates . But even that emphasis can never be narrowly understood . The moral essence of the American Constitution is crucial to the motivation of the action done to defend it . The stake is not only government lawfulness in itself , apart from the content of the Constitution and the laws . Arendt herself relents into a more conventional understanding . In two works published shortly after " Civil Disobedience " ? On Violence and " Thoughts on Politics and Revolution " ? she praises the moral intensity of the student movement and speaks of ordinary self-interest as if it were the only kind of self-interest , and she speaks of it denigratingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement is more striking than its disinterestedness. " 50 She illustrates disinterestedness by , of all things , compassion , and by the passion for justice ; and attributes these qualities to all revolutionary leaders , including Marx and Lenin.51 She says that the student rebellion is " almost exclusively inspired by moral considerations . " 52 All these things she says approvingly . Correspondingly , she mocks the pseudorealist concept of enlightened selfinterest : " Self-interest , when asked to yield to true ' interest ? that is , the interest of the world as distinguished from that of the self ? will always reply , // Near is my shirt , but nearer is my skin . " 53 We should not cling to these statements . Taken all together , they still do not allow conscience a place in political life . Such disallowance is Arendt 's distinctive emphasis . But the element of conscience can not be theorized out of civil disobedience or out of political action , even action as conceptualized by Arendt . What is this conscience , finally , if not the anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act to ameliorate or end such wrong is not primarily wanting to end one 's own anguish felt as spectator or agent . It is wanting to end another kind of anguish , the anguish of those to whom wrong is being done . The conscience of the civil disobedient is the imagination of suffering , the ability to imagine what it must be like to go through suffering while one is not suffering.54 Instigated by it to act energetically and unconventionally , alone or with others , is to be a democratic citizen in the modern age . Unnecessary breaches of moral limits , surplus evil , exaggerated ambitions , and atrocities are a constant possibility , especially in foreign affairs . The negative politics of conscience goes well with the structure and values of constitutional democracy : limited and divided government and a regular politics of dispute and contest . It goes better than ameliorative politics . The ultimate sources of conscientious politics must include the great moral absolutists , the figures of Jesus , Socrates , and closer to our time , Thoreau , Gandhi , Martin Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conscientious actor are those whose lives and teachings transcended the moral world of civil disobedience or any other mode of the politics of conscience . Some were martyrs ; some extended the range of obligatory actions for themselves . In such transcendence they made room for the lesser form of conscience that inspires all kinds of conscientious political acts , and some kinds of reformist politics as well . Perhaps in Thoreau we find the most instructive modern distillation . Thoreau is relentless , excessive . His writings on politics as well as Walden contain sentences that seem to champion a radical subjectivity with a corresponding lack of sociality ; a contempt for ordinary political action combined with a detestation of the very notion of government ; a claim to autonomous judgment that seems to make any living together impossible ; an appeal to self-sacrificing moral absolutism that strangely does not exclude an acceptance of violence and does not include a patient willingness to use regular procedures of social change . Such sentences express his strongest temptations and are therefore necessary emanations , although easily misunderstood . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his true sentiments as a writer for others unmistakable , and these sentiments are unmistakably political . Thoreau is saying one must think for oneself ; one must not be enclosed by the system of conventions , must never live dans le vrai . One must make sure that one does not abet injustice by inattention ; a fact must be called by its right name . Living a life does not necessarily lead to continuous citizenship , but if citizenship means anything , it means that the citizen will object and resist when the collective power to which he or she contributes is used atrociously. // Martyrdom is not asked for , but some discomfort is the unavoidable price of conscience . Resistance will take the form either of a luminous act ( an act potent to instruct in itself ) , or an exemplary act ( a symbolic act that lends itself to being written about and memorialized ) . One condemns only by the standard of ordinary morality . One must stay awake to awaken others or to learn from others . The guarantor of this watchfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing oneself in anything unself-consciously.55 Not being at one with society requires that a person not be falsely at one with himself . A person is falsely at one with himself when he is at one with his role or function in society : in the sleep of bad faith , in the sleep of unconscious or studied mimesis . This doubleness is not the Socratic internal dialogue of me and myself in retrospect , after the fact , the two-in-one that Arendt places at the source of conscience , but rather a continuous division in the acting self , although there are similarities between the two concepts . The desired mode of action is that of detached engagement , austere passion , and all-consuming scruples . Thoreau himself must be seen as embracing the extremes . He mocks conscience because conscience condemns the world for its evil instead of loving it for its beauty . 56He paradoxically raises beauty over goodness by saying that " the perception of beauty is a moral test.i57 He eases his way beyond good and evil by professing that the " impression made on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he extends the sense of moral responsibility to the point where a taxpayer in a free state is personally responsible for the continuation of slavery . He is alone , yet he stays alone because his love of others is so intense that their deficiencies unsettle him . His lack of domesticity does not remove him into solitude , but it intensifies his public nature , his citizenship . He seems so cavalier toward the noise and clamor of public life . Yet " at the time of the John Brown tragedy , Thoreau was driven sick . So the country 's misfortunes in the Union war acted on his feelings with great force : he used to say he could never recover while the war lasted . " ' 59 His role in life is not universalizable , but it is nevertheless indispensable . He , like the other great sponsors , is a model only in the sense that he inspires . " Let the judge and the jury , and the sheriff and the jailer , cease to act under a corrupt government ? cease to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitated , but rather to be kept in mind while the conscientious person acts , Thoreau makes it possible to conceive civil disobedience and other forms of conscientious politics as ideal politics : nonviolent , nonroutine , nonselfish , episodic , perhaps philsophical . By the standard of power , some forms may seem trivial , distracting , or self-indulgent . We may be struck especially by the immense discrepancy between civil disobedience when it consists in breaking a minor law like trespass and the scale of cruelty of an unjust war . But one power all forms have , either as individual or group acts , either as direct or indirect refusal ? the power of annunication , first to make a matter hard to ignore , and then to make it urgent . If this politics is not the most heroic or the most esthetically impressive politics , then it is nevertheless as heroic and beautiful as nonmurderous politics can be . Arendt fights Thoreau // all through the pages of her essay on civil disobedience , but finally he overcomes even her immensely resourceful and provocative attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of her work , Arendt pays only reluctant attention to the practice and theory of representative democracy . She also gives it scant praise . Most important of all , she never says or suggests that representative democracy is a genuinely distinctive political system with special moral claims . By her reckoning , it has some undeniably good effects . But wherever the realm of the public is not really the people 's realm , wherever there is no direct democracy , discriminations among the forms of public life , among forms of government , do not seem to have major theoretical importance . The trouble is that the subject of representative democracy can not be slighted without hurting one 's sense of the sufficiency of a given political theory in modern times . Political theory must deal with representative democracy in earnest , if for no other reason than that it is one of the two main forms of existent government ( along with dictatorship ) , and the only form preponderantly accorded legitimacy . That it should be accorded legitimacy is of course open to serious dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the initial matter for the reflection of most contemporary political theorists . In saying , therefore , that Arendt slights this theme , one is also saying that if there is no other point of vulnerability in her thought , then surely there is this one . But Arendt 's own theory not only requires that full attention be paid to representative democracy but also that it be given a measure of praise , praise for its distinctiveness . We can not expect her to judge it as " the ideally best polity " : Love of participatory citizenship ( separate from offices , from professionalism ) forbids such a judgment . The fact remains that some other things Arendt praises or values depend in modern times on the existence of representative democracy . Without this form ? and realized of course in more than a merely formalist way ? there would be more of the things she dreads and fewer of the things she celebrates . That representative democracies have themselves engendered some dreadful things , that they have engendered atrocities like the Vietnam War , does not settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocities be regularly counted on , because of the very spirit of their form . Furthermore , Arendt is quick to insist that concerted response to atrocities , // and to lesser kinds of wrongdoing inflicted or tolerated by government , can be not only the instrument of redress but also the occasion for the reappearance of the thing she celebrates most ? real political action . Thus the spirit of representative democracy keeps resistance alive and allows it to shape itself into the latest expression of direct political participation , civil disobedience . It has been noted that the positive moral center of The Origins of Totalitarianism is the character type conceptually associated with citizenship in representative democracy , and that Arendt makes almost nothing of this fact . This chapter explores this reticence and discusses as well some of the theoretical arguments that she constructs and that work with a largely disparaging effect on the assertion that representative democracy is a distinctive and praiseworthy political system . The most important point is that Arendt 's own political theory must make much more room for representative democracy , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second best as an imperfect approximation of the best , but as valuable despite its structural dissimilarities with the best . The Play of Interests If Arendt wants to free politics from the claims and constraints of conscience and goodness , she certainly does not want to do so for the sake of theoretically easing the way for interest , self-interest , domination , expansion , conquest , or any other ambition that the world ? but not Arendt ? considers as proper for the ends of action . The world 's worldliness is not Arendt 's . Throughout her work she expresses a fairly steady distaste for what common opinion holds to be the stuff of politics . This distaste comes out in her first and main characterization of the politics of representative democracy , found in On Revolution . In effect , what she finds when she looks at the daily life of representative democracy is an obsession with economic interest . Apart from the gross fact that representation in itself is not compatible with participatory politics , the arrangements and procedures of representative democracy are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true aims of political action . Even earlier , in The Human Condition , Arendt condemned modern politics altogether because of the tendency of the " social " to invade the public realm ; specifically , for the tendency of the programs and details of welfare capitalism to absorb all public attention and energies . The administration of social and economic life " has overshadowed the political realm ever since the beginning of the modern age . " ' There is no doubt that the popular nature of representative democracy ensures that economic concerns will be publicly central . This is an indication that representative democracy , at least on domestic policies , is substantially faithful to popular wishes . It would be hard to believe that any political system meant to be responsive to the people could fail to give priority to economic issues . In modern life , a different priority can only be imagined . One might say that Marcuse 's One-Dimensional Man is a heroic effort to imagine such a world . Yet that book does not present itself as a work of the imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to manipulate its people into // an exclusive addiction to production and consumption . Marcuse never says what is simply the case : Advanced industrial society coincides with immemorial yearnings for material abundance , even if this society is not the " necessary " outcome of such yearnings . People crave not only material sufficiency ? enough is not enough ? but abundance , in order to escape the confinement , the curse , of having to be careful about every penny . On the other hand , Arendt knows deeply that advanced industrial society is faithful to the inescapable ordinariness of human beings in almost all times and places . Therefore , insofar as representative democracy is popular government , it will be dominated by economic issues . Economic well-being will be privately pursued and publicly sustained . Why does Arendt resist and rebel against this gross fact ? The reasons are not always clear , but two main considerations , sharply contrasting in character , shape the insistence that economic issues are not proper subjects for the discussions and debates of the public world . First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic interests to promote themselves by means of the electoral system falsifies the nature of politics by forcing on it essentially private or social purposes . One might say that when economic interests are the substance of political action a component of human life has moved out of its appropriate place and invaded a place that is not its own . One kind of game has taken over the field of another and displaced the rightful possessor . Arendt laments this nearly universal transgression . Her regret may sometimes appear as if it were esthetically induced ; as if she found the world guilty of esthetic ignorance or confusion ? of not knowing what game to play where and when , and consequently abolishing the best but most fragile , most rare game , political action . But her sense of loss goes deeper . She is convinced that where the typical motives associated with the rough play of economic interests are present the existential potentialities of political action are not fulfilled . A selfish concern with oneself or one 's partial group can not be a source of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other extreme , Arendt believes that the disinterested effort , made by those who hold public office , to remedy the condition of the disadvantaged , is not proper political activity . Rather , it is to be understood solely as technical or administrative activity . It thus has a kind of rigidity or even necessity that proper political activity does not have . It lacks open-endedness , indefiniteness , free and uncertain choice . It is not only the heroic and self-destructive effort made by the Jacobins and Bolsheviks to solve " the social question " that Arendt judges as inimical to the preservation of the genuinely political . She also finds that when the energies of political life go into devising plans for gradual social amelioration political life is lost . For Arendt , then , the enemy of politics is economics . At once responsive to popular pressures and the vehicle of popular involvement , representative democracy consummates the triumph of economics over politics , the triumph in the public sphere , for the most part , of the private and self-regarding over the impersonal and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations is in order . In regard to the fact that much of the political energies of representative // democracy are absorbed by the play of economic interests , anyone must concede that self-interest , both crude and subtle , is unleashed . Conventional political science has insisted for several generations that the usual motives of political constituents ? whether influential individuals , officials of corporations and other organizations , or leaders of various associations and pressure groups ? are narrowly purposive , and that the techniques of persuasion used on public officials often resemble bribery or intimidation or , to use Arendt 's word again , " blackmail . " 2 The very notion of a public or common interest seems to vanish in this greedy roughhouse . Equally important , public officials are disposed to satisfy the claims of interest groups , even if conflicts of interest ensure a never-ending supply of dilemmas for those who must painfully decide which interest they will favor and which they must at least for the time being turn away . The " political culture " keeps public officials close , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal condition is one that Arendt does not hesitate to call " corruption . " 3 Those who seek and those who respond are involved in a pervasive corruption . She seems to be saying that when the domination of economics over politics takes the form of the democratic politics of interest , the corruption is intrinsic . Sometimes she places her emphasis on the ability of some interest groups to gain advantages at the expense of others . A sense of these impositions leads her to advocate that " The public realm .... be shielded from the private interests which have intruded upon it in the most brutal and aggressive form . " ' But the deeper corruption she finds does not reside so much in selfishness as in self-regardingness . That is , the promotion of interest may be the promotion of legitimate interest and without hurt to others . Yet this conversion of politics into an instrument of something self-regarding is corrupt in itself , corrupt in an old civic or republican sense . One could say that such corruption is even innocent . But the more innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that what it normally does is to extinguish true political action . Arendt 's aversion to the dominance of economic interest carries her to the extreme of suggesting , with Jefferson , that it could well be " dangerous " to give everyone the right to vote when most remain inexperienced in the raison d'etre of politics . Voting is conceptualized by Arendt as " power .... given to the people in their private capacity . " s Toward the close of her meditation on Jefferson 's barely sketched ward system of politics and the analogous council system , she goes so far as to advocate that a new republic be formed as a network of freely created and self-selected councils and grassroots political organs : To be sure , such an " aristocratic " form of government would spell the end of general suffrage as we understand it today ; for only those who as voluntary members of an " elementary republic " have demonstrated that they care for more than their private happiness and are concerned about the state of the world would have the right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This is Arendt 's only utopia : a new frame for public happiness . She never again goes so far in abandoning representative democracy , but the distaste never leaves her . Arendt 's distaste does not derive from an uncharacteristic fit of moralizing . Her plea for public happiness is scarcely a plea for any kind of altruism . We // have seen how strong her fear of ( absolute ) goodness is when it interjects itself into politics . The politics of selfishness , as well as the larger politics of self-regardingness , is bad because it is unworldly . It is unworldly because it is unconcerned with the survival of the world , which is understood especially as the place where political action is possible . The aim of politics is to perpetuate itself , to immortalize itself ? not only in the sense that individuals aspire to say and do imperishable things , but in the enfolding sense that all who act act for the sake of preserving future possibilities of action . The common interest is the preservation of the frame of action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who act with the feeling that others will come after them to take their place on the stage of action . She says , " If the world is to contain a public space , it can not be erected for one generation and planned for the living only ; it must transcend the life-span of mortal men . " 7 Relatedly , the concept of the public signifies that the world as the place of action must be " common to all of us and distinguished from our privately owned place in it . " 8 It not only permits what is best in each to disclose itself , but it is separate from each . It vanishes when it is owned or possessed just as much as when it is ignored . The politics of selfishness and self-regardingness are no more consonant with true politics than either psychological self-absorption or a religious concern with eternity . The misfortune is that representative democracy , in its unyielding actuality , is in Arendt 's judgment little more than the consecration of selfishness and self-regardingness . And that little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some remarks made not long before her death , Arendt presented a different contrasting conception to selfishness and self-regardingness . Not worldliness as concern for one 's own immortality or that of the public world , but impartiality is offered as the proper spirit of public participation . She presents impartiality as a kind of worldliness , but she changes the existential coloring . The political institution in which impartiality is the presiding principle is the jury . In an earlier conversation with colleagues at a conference devoted to her work ( November 1972 ) , she had spoken of the jury as " the last remnant of active citizen participation in the republic , " and , like the town meeting , one of " the very few places where a non-spurious public still exists . " 9 She had never before considered the jury as a truly political institution . Impartiality had rarely appeared before in any itemization of political virtues.lo Arendt 's last remarks on the jury enrich her conception of political action . Yet it still is a bit strange that an occasion as essentially reactive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should strike Arendt as one real model of political life . In any case , what matters is that the qualities of engagement expected of jurors are contrasted sharply with the qualities enlisted in the normal politics of representative democracy : Jurors are equalized by the task and the place .... They must deal with something which is of no private interest to them at all : they are interested in someth ing in regard to which they are disinterested . What jurors share is an interest in the case ? something outside themselves ; what makes them common is something that is not subjective . " Arendt 's sustained antithesis to this worldly impartiality is the pursuit of // economic interest . She insists that there is " an intrinsic conflict " between all interests ( as conventionally defined ) and an interest in the world . Indeed , she makes sacrifice of private interests an inevitable feature of fidelity to the well-being of the public world ? perhaps its very sign.12 In regard to the other way in which economics crowds out politics ? namely , the determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelenting . Of course , it is not that she wants the disadvantaged to be ignored . Certainly in recent times the capacities of amelioration have grown far beyond what they were when Robespierre and Saint Just tried to practice the politics of pity . Arendt is hostile to capitalism not only because it now subjugates capitalist societies ( and by the radiation of its influence , socialist societies too ) to unappeasable consumerism , but also because she associates it historically with the intensification of misery . The " unchained , unbridled private initiative ' of capitalism has in the absence of natural wealth .... led everywhere to unhappiness and mass poverty.i13 Arendt 's theoretical contention is that the project of amelioration , although by no means guaranteed success , can proceed only in an administered manner . For that reason , if this project comes to be seen as the central focus of public life , the understanding of the nature of public life is lost . Thus capitalism in its successes and failures , in its opulence and in its misery , accentuates the departure from the truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given its extent , attention must be paid to it . Arendt 's hope would be that such attention would be paid only by those who know how to deal with the complexities inherent in the condition of the disadvantaged . These complexities should not be politicized . Only then would the field of public life be left open and reserved for the truly political . Arendt offers two convergent arguments . First , the effort to politicize administration injures administration . Second , the effort to politicize administration injures politics . Her underlying premise is that wherever a question of policy has one and only one right answer it ceases having one of the traits that are necessary for a question to be appropriate for discussion in the public place , for it to be the pretext or instigation for action as revelatory speech . " Public debate can only deal with things which ? if we want to put it negatively ? we can not figure out with certainty . " 4 There must be room for citizenly variety to manifest itself in expressed differences ofresponse , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on indeterminacy . She never says or implies that the range of valid opinion is indefinitely large , or that we should withhold the words right and wrong altogether from the opinions put forth in public discussion and debate . There is a distinction between a confined indeterminacy , so to speak , and an absolute insolubility . The model of the jury figures in her remarks on indeterminacy . After telling the gathering of her colleagues that she had " great delight " in serving as a juror , even though temperamentally averse to political participation in general ( who else could praise action as she does but one who only watches ? ) , she says that a jury 's questions " are somehow really debatable . " She adds : // The jury was extremely responsible , but also aware that there are different viewpoints , from the two sides of the court-trial , from which you could look at the issue . This seems to me quite clearly a matter of common public interest.15 In contrast , reformist and welfarist measures are not basically debatable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are things where the right measures can be figured out . These things can really be administered and are not then subject to public debate . " 16 Arendt gives as an example the question of how many square feet of floor space every person needs in order to have decent housing . When pressed ( by Albrecht Wellmer ) to give one example of a social problem that is not also a political one , she acknowledges that every such question has a " double face . " 17 What she seems to mean is that there can be debate as to whether public housing should be integrated , but not as to whether every person is entitled to decent housing . In effect , she rules out two sorts of question from the sphere of indeterminacy and therefore of debate : first , whether every person has basic entitlements , and second , how to satisfy some of these entitlements materially . Strictly , her overall theoretical position requires only that the second sort be ruled out . The first sort , the issue of entitlements or rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double face " that issues may have , it emerges that Arendt has not really granted much . Her conception of political action at its best simply does not accommodate the dailiness of reformist and welfarist politics , and such politics is , in turn , a principal part of the politics of representative democracy . What can one say in response to her account of the actuality of representative democracy ? If its actuality were mostly selfishness and self-regardingness ( with some managerial attention to the needs of the disadvantaged ) , Arendt would be right to withhold praise . It could not make distinctive moral or existential claims . If we assume that her depiction is right , the best we can do is to say that both the rough play of economic interests and the efforts undertaken in behalf of the disadvantaged show " signs and traces " 18 of real political action . Both may involve action on a large scale ; specifically , in the American setting , action in the national ( or state ) places of politics . Unlike the several sorts of activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a political perspective , even though they do not unfold in national places or are not strictly public , a fair amount of the politics of economics is carried on by national public actors , by national officials , elected and unelected . In dealing with these officials , private citizens are necessarily active in the national places of politics . Correspondingly , some large part of the interests or the concerns pursued have wide importance ; their affairs have grave consequences and implications . To deal with economic matters is often to deal with matters of the highest seriousness , even though anyone who takes politics itself seriously must wish that people were less obsessive about economic matters than they are , that they would more usually find other pretexts and instigations for political action . One wishes that selfishness and self-regardingness ( on the one hand ) had , and that concern for the misfortune of others ( on the other hand ) could morally have , less of a role . Yet the fact remains that both main modes of the politics of economics have at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is a kind of agonistic quality . Although not all her analyses of the spirit in which the participant acts include competitiveness or the wish to excel , at least one does : action as virtuosity in performance . Her Greek conception , in general , emphasizes the agonistic . A case could be made for the idea that both the rough play of interests and the efforts of amelioration often elicit a dramatically intense pattern of action ? stirring , instructive , and sometimes dignified . Moreover , for many of the actors the involvement has a quite self-conscious agonistic aspect : The politics of economics turns into a purer politics . The desire to prevail is abstracted from economic content , and sometimes even , antagonists mainfest a greater joy in involvement than in victory . In a formal sense , capitalism is a political system . Not only is its essence economic competitiveness between firms and entrepreneurs ( an important moral fact in itself ) , but also the connections between firms , entrepreneurs , and pressure groups ( on one side ) and elected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as are the rivalries between firms and entrepeneurs for the favors and support of officials , who themselves are also impelled into agonistic relations by their constituents . In all these respects , this play resists the drag toward centralized passivity that Arendt so dreaded . Even though the unit of action is often an organization , the politics of economics provides a vivid spectacle of nonorganizational action . By this spectacle , representative democracy as a system challenges the prestige of the idea that the only possible form of purposive and intelligent action is bureaucratic . To challenge the all-sufficiency of bureaucracy is to retard the emergence of routine thoughtlessness and hence of atrocity , among other praiseworthy results . To some interesting degree , speech is the medium of this action . The politics of economics rarely produces great speech ; its speech is too often technical or too close to a real or an affected sense of necessity to be edifying . But we must also remember that when Arendt talks about the fine politics of councils she pays no attention to rhetorical power and beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of its own business , its own unglamorous dailiness . Heroic it surely is , and far more heroic than the exertions of economic actors . It is liberated and liberating . But it need not be more esthetically compelling or more capable of attaining the revelatory effects that Arendt posited for political action especially in her Greek conception . The actuality of representative democracy , even if seen as primarily the politics of economics , is political enough in its agonistic aspect to earn for itself the designation of political ? in some way not too attenuated or distorted . If this is true , it becomes less acceptable for one of Arendt 's outlook to avoid a direct theoretical confrontation with representative democracy . An approximate kind of real politics is found in its normal actuality , even though not the highest kind . To allow this argument , however , is still not to reach the point from which we could then try to show that representative democracy is a genuinely distinctive political system with special moral claims , and a system // that should lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as " second best . " Representative democracy is distinctive and praiseworthy because it sponsors , in a way and with an intensity peculiar to itself , commendable moral and political phenomena . For one with Arendt 's outlook the most important of these phenomena must be the disposition to dissent , to resist , to say no . One main political form of this disposition is the politics of civil disobedience . It is not of course the only form of resistance . Arendt singles it out and praises it as the latest example of true political action . Behind her praise there is also a moral admiration for the very fact of resistance to a war she found odious . She calls civil disobedience an American invention , but she does not explain why it began in America and not elsewhere . The reason has a great deal to do with the fact that the United States is the most fully realized representative democracy , the most free of vestiges of contrasting or antithetical political systems , at least in the public realm . In addition , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very existence , demonstrate that other political endeavors are housed by representative democracy than the manifold exertions of the politics of economics . Significantly , they are often free of selfishnss and selfregardingness and of the impress of the technical . One must add that other noneconomic aims enter the national , state , and local political scene in America , and they do not express themselves , at least at first , in movements of illegal resistance , but rather of publicity , agitation , demonstration , persuasion , and the heightening of consciousness . Such movements offer legal naysaying , legal resistance to government policy . The issues of ecology , abortion , women 's rights , and the rights of diverse minorities created movements that figured importantly in Arendt 's lifetime and still figure today . Because almost all these issues are at least partly constitutional in nature , they can be nicely accommodated by Arendt 's modern conception of political action . Similar movements may be expected to continue to appear , just as they always have in America . These movements are not only necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spirit . Yet they often move against the tide . They comprise the shapely amorphousness of citizenly involvement . ( Of course , other representative democracies contain comparable tendencies , and obviously not always because of the force of American example . ) Thus , one may reasonably complain that Arendt did not give enough attention to the abundance of noneconomic political movements that were all around her . The politics of representative democracy has always shown a genuine and vibrant political life besides the economic agon . And though this life is conceptually linked to the spirit of representative democracy and practically linked to its basic institution , the electoral system , it is a parallel political system to the formal one . For many , citizenship is not confined to voting , even though its more dramatic engagements can be only episodic , and perhaps singular in and discontinuous with the rest of the lives of those engaged . The all-absorbing politics of the polis or the councils is not reproduced by these movements . However , they may be as urgent and // revelatory as , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative and reactive . And though negative and reactive , they are not limited in creative passion . If that is the case , it follows that Arendt 's depiction of the actuality of representative democracy is seriously incomplete . She does not take in what her own outlook should have highlighted . The crucial result is that when she theorizes issues connected to representative democracy , she produces a stimulating set of reflections , but she does not bestow on representative democracy itself a moral status that it deserves . It is as if the system were too coarse in its dailiness to be a fit object of theoretical embrace . Furthermore , Arendt leaves it at the mercy of a " thin " theory of obligation ? a thinness that answers to her general distaste for a system that she virtually identifies with the politics of selfishness and self-regardingness , as well as with the confusion of the political and the administrative . Consent to be Governed How , then , does Arendt approach representative democracy theoretically ? The leading texts are On Revolution and " Civil Disobedience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She introduces some conceptual changes from the earlier texts to " Civil Disobedience , " published in 1970 . Also , only in the latter essay does she make a direct contribution to the theory of political obligation , a basic component of the theory of representative democracy . The general tendency of her work is remote from concern with political obligation , despite the political emphasis she gives to the idea of the promise . The associative bonds she idealizes lack the distance , the strains and reluctances , the degree of alienation , that always accompany associative bonds conceived as bonds of obligation . Arendt would think it foreign for a comparatively small group of citizens , whether in the polis or town meeting or councils , to imagine that they were held together by a sense of obligation , or even by a sense of duty . Obedience to agencies outside themselves , to enactments they do not make for themselves , does not define their relationship , which is that of mutuality . A positive commitment , sustained by continuous participation , makes obligation or duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representative democracy impinge : She eventually works out a theory of obligation when the issue of disobedience becomes stark . Without civil disobedience it is doubtful that Arendt would ever have turned to this theme , even though The Human Condition and On Revolution certainly offer some intimations . The fundamental matter is that Arendt conceives of representative democracy as a system that works by means of an essential passivity , the passivity of the large mass of individuals who live under it . That they live under it is only another way of saying that they do not live the system : Their continuous and direct relations do not constitute the system . She relegates representative democracy to a status radically severed from direct democracy , and she nearly assimilates it to all nontyrannical systems , even if they are nondemocratic systems : especially to limited monarchy . ' 9 The irony is that // she sees passivity not in spite of , but because of , the obsession with economic affairs . The energies of selfishness and self-regardingness derive from political passivity or inertness . All that furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributes to that unmaking of man that Tom Paine condemned the ancien regime for , and which he thought that representative democracy would remedy much more suitably than " simple " democracy . Arendt in effect rejects Paine 's judgment . Representative democracy allows people to unmake themselves , even while they think themselves whole and free . Whenever the pursuit of happiness is the declared principle , and happiness is understood as private rather than public , and understood as " getting and spending " rather than as achieving a public identity through action , the reign of passivity is established , and with it and as part of it the confirmation of human isolation.20 One might say that for Arendt selfishness and self-regardingness are deplorable not so much because they are immoral or show indifference to others , but because they condemn people to an existential lack , the inability to live intensely , to acquire individuation . Yet representative democracy is , as it were , the voluntary renunciation of such a possibility . The devotion of life to the pursuit of ( private ) happiness creates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sacrifice of active citizenship . Let us notice certain things Arendt indicates about governance . First , she is not a philosophical anarchist . She never even toys with the idea that a society could exist without government ( in the executive , bureaucratic sense ) . Her only conceptual dread is that a government will claim sovereignty over its people . ( She celebrates the American theoretical avoidance of such governmental sovereignty ) .21 Second , she is sympathetic to the concept of authority , and she is prepared to praise the institutional embodiment that , for example , republican Rome and constitutional America have given it . The only proviso is that political office-holders must not claim authority over their fellow citizens and thus reduce them to children.22 Last , she is not swift to denounce all those governed peoples who have never had the chance to imagine or to practice political action at its best . For all the weight of these things , Arendt is insistent in her assertion that representative democracy is the forfeiture ? at least half deliberate ? of the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and do not also reserve for themselves the regular practice of participatory politics : the various activities of discussion , deliberation , and persuasion that lead to decision-making . The political passions present in democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century did not survive their initial success , the founding of new political systems . Either the new system failed by design to create a regular way of enlisting those passions ( as in America ) , or it succumbed to the claims of necessity ( as in France ) . The passions , we can say , were deflected by either the politics of economics ( in America ) or the politics of pity ( in France ) . The moment was lost . The story of this loss is told in On Revolution . What matters theoretically is the philosophical argumentation that // facilitated or rationalized the abdication of active citizenship , the conversion of the promise of freedom into a voluntarily accepted and therefore more efficacious system of governance , a system largely devoid of the opportunity for ordinary people to practice citizenship . It should be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction is not elaborated or systematically applied ; but it does work in favor of representative government , at least in America and Britain . Her most direct statement is found in remarks she made at a roundtable discussion in 1969 : Now you can rule over willing subjects and unwilling subjects . To the extent that you rule over willing subjects , you can say that they have consented to be ruled . And this was in a way true for all medieval forms of government . But it is not our concept of government . Our way is that we form the government and we elect our representatives who then govern , but do not rule.23 Because representatives do not rule , citizens do not resignedly obey , but actively support , the laws . At least , their obedience is never unquestioning , and it is certainly never the childish obedience of man to man.24 " Under conditions of representative government the people are supposed to rule those who govern them . " 25 Yet Arendt speaks of the dilemma of representation . If the representatives are bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spontaneous action , and if they are not so bound , " the age-old distinction between ruler and ruled which the Revolution had set out to abolish through the establishment of a republic has asserted itself once again . " 26 In the first case , the office-holders are reduced to experts and agents , and thus their action is reduced to something like administration . In the second case , the people are reduced to the condition of subject , free only on election day . Arendt says that the latter is " somewhat closer to realities . " 27 In saying that , however , she is implying that the office-holders are true citizens not because they rule the represented . Her emphasis is on the genuinely political relations of discussion and deliberation within the group of elected office-holders ( to leave aside the question of whether the content of their talk is genuinely political ) , rather than on the relations between office-holders and the mass of politically inactive individuals.28 That is , ruling even in the form of making rules ( laws ) for others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a relation of unequals . We therefore can call it true action only if we sever it from its very nature and actual effect ; only if we ignore the fact that in their discussion and deliberation , the representatives have made laws for others ? the people ? to obey . ( Not that the lawmakers are above the laws , of course . ) What matters most , however , is that if the people go along unquestioningly , representative democracy retains the network of ruling and being ruled , with all the existential loss sustained by the great majority who never hold office or seek participation . The distinction between being governed and being ruled tends easily to effacement . Not until the appearance of civil disobedience in the 1960s does Arendt say that modern citizenship can also exist outside of offices , whether the offices of representative democracy or the informal offices of councils . // The philosophical argumentation that facilitates or rationalizes this free alienation by most of the people is found in the theory of consent as embodied in contract . Arendt develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and it uncovers aspects of the theory that are ignored by most commentators and readers . She manages , once again , to refresh a subject that had grown wearisome and over-familiar and had therefore suffered an undeserved diminishment . Yet her analysis is not always acceptable , and some of her conclusions are certainly not acceptable . Later , in " Civil Disobedience " she revises her analysis of contract and , at the same time , so reworks her understanding of consent as to rehabilitate this concept , even while disconnecting it from the regular institutional workings of representative democracy . In the first discussion , as well as in the later one , she theorizes with the effect of disparaging representative democracy 's claim to distinctiveness and praise . Arendt 's basic thesis concerning the nature of representative government , as presented in On Revolution , is that : Even if there is communication between representative and voter , between the nation and parliament ? and the existence of such communication marks the outstanding difference between the governments of the British and the Americans , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ? this communication is never between equals but between those who aspire to govern and those who consent to be governed ( emphasis added ) .29 The cardinal notion seems to be " consent to be governed " : representative democracy is a system in which the people give their consent to be governed . Arendt has deliberately taken an ambiguous phrase ? " consent of the governed " ? and changed it so as to reduce it to an essentially passive meaning . She finds in the practices oflimited monarchy the source and earliest embodiment of consent , even if it is consent to be ruled rather than governed . Therefore , from the point of view of provision for ture political action of the people , representative democracy hardly marks an advance over the more moderate regimes of centuries past . Evidence of consent to rule consists in " the right to voice grievances and to withhold consent " : 30 which rights were held at the king 's discretion by incipient parliamentary bodies that could say yes or no but not really act , not initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by the executive ; and the executive is not hereditary . Ruling is not the same as governing . Still , Arendt means to draw limited monarchy and representative democracy closer together than almost any other political scientist would hazard to do . Although she does not explicitly link her discussion of representative democracy in On Revolution to her consideration of theories of contract , it seems that Arendt wishes to suggest that the philosophical foundations of representative democracy are in a certain tradition of contractual theory . Whatever the theoretical contribution made by the practices of limited monarchy , one theory of contract in the seventeenth century and later has been decisive for the articulated self-understanding of representative democracy . Against this theory of contract Arendt plays off another , which she // prizes ; and in her prizing of it , the contrary theory , associated with representative democracy , is necessarily reproached . The contract ( social contract ) Arendt prizes creates a body politic on the basis of mutual promises made by equals . The model is the Mayflower Compact . The disseminated examples are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is passionate and eloquent about the political novelty shown by the untutored genius of the English settlers . Confronted by the perils of a new world and thrown back on themselves , they found salvation in mutual trust . They bound each other by freely given promises and lived up to them . The continuous political institutionalization of the original declaration of mutuality was a daily , participatory politics : The forum of decision-making was the town meeting . Arendt pays little attention to magistracies , executive functions . She says too quickly that these new political bodies " were not conceived as governments , strictly speaking.i31 She must take the necessity of magistracy as a matter of course . What signifies is that there existed something besides magistracies and something in place of an alienating representation . The political life of early America ? without which the urge to declare independence and fight a war to secure it would have been unthinkable ? was , then , the realization of the best political life . Society originated in the voluntary and binding agreement of the interested parties ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new power structure " of equal participants continuously active deliberatively.32 In contrast to the prized theory of contract is the philosophers ' conceptualization of the social contract . Not only Hobbes but also the " innocent " Locke is enlisted by Arendt in the tradition of consent as solely consent to be ruled . ( In On Revolution she never explicitly fits consent to be governed into a contractual theory . ) She says that only the contract of mutuality contains the republican principle " in nuce.i33 Any political system of consent , whether to be ruled or to be governed , signifies popular abdication to one degree or another . Of course , no tradition of theory can be seen as the sufficient or prepotent source of the creation and perpetuation of political institutions . Still , theory provides at least a rationalization that bestows an artificial intelligibility on systems in being or in the process of formation , and by doing that , strengthens them and may even in time bring them more nearly to resemble their theoretical shape . Perhaps that is the intellectual pattern Arendt posits : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the colonial political " treasure , " and to pursue , instead , private happiness , while erroneously claiming to be free ? free , in the true sense , not merely liberated from oppression . The cunning of the theory of consent is that it hides existential subjection . Arendt is saying in On Revolution that the theory of Hobbes and Locke is a theory of contract between " a people and its ruler , " or between " a given society and its ruler , " in return for protection.34 Present in Hobbes and Locke is only a confused notion of a contractual founding of a society by individuals . Arendt says that the real substance of the contract in both writers is the consent of individuals to live under a government and obey it . She speaks as if // the government were an already existent entity that bargained as a moral equal with each individual , or alternatively with the people . There may , in truth , be elements in the theories of Hobbes and Locke that lend themselves to this interpretation , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractual relationship between government and the individual , or between government and the people . In passing , one may notice that Hobbes allows for a convenant between an individual and his conqueror who becomes his sovereign after the expressed readiness of the conquered individual to acknowledge him as such . Locke 's provision for an express oath of allegiance ? that is , for the explicit and voluntary act ofjoining a proper political society by an individual ? is made to the king . But even these elements fall short of a contract with government . The plain fact is that this contract is a feature of the parliamentary Whig tradition . For both Hobbes and Locke ? and it is always a cause for suspicion when a commentator joins them in a common position ? the contract simply establishes that there will be a government , its form to be decided by majority vote . If Locke is taken as the exemplary theorist of representative government , the point is that his sense is strong and constant that government issues from the agreement of the people ; that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to moral priority ; that it is their servant . It exists by permission and on sufferance . Its temporary absence because of resistance to it is less awful than its absolutist and overpowering presence . Locke makes no explicit provision for direct participation , universal suffrage , or even automatic common citizenship . Neither representative nor participatory institutions are strict moral entailments from his basic moral principles , although a representative legislature is certainly desirable . If he is a democrat , he is a silent one . But all this is not equivalent to the theoretical rationalization of individual ( or popular ) passivity that must ensue from deploying the un-Lockean idea of a contract between government and the individual ( or the people ) . The conclusion is that consent of the governed does not mean consent to be governed ( in Arendt 's pejorative sense ) , much less consent to be ruled . No philosophy of representative democracy can rest on the idea that rightful government is coeval with the people , either literally or metaphorically , and that it therefore is their moral equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all government , even representative democracy , is morally dubious , morally inferior . ( When such an assertion is made , the executive power is the principal object of indictment . ) Beyond that , Locke can not be taken as the exemplary theorist of representative democracy . Although not a rationalizer of passivity , he is still not a robust , unequivocal defender of representative democracy . He should be seen more as an antecedent to the theory of representative democracy than as an actual principal . Just by discrediting the idea of a contract with government , he works with an undeniably great force as an antecedent . But we must look to such figures as the Levellers , Paine , some anti-Federalists , American democrats of the // nineteenth and twentieth centuries , and to J. S. Mill , among others , for the true articulation . When we do , we find a conceptualization ( in various forms ) that stresses the dynamic qualities of the notion of the consent of the governed ( whether or not the idea of contract is deployed ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , none of the passivity that goes along with it . ( It is disturbing that Arendt sometimes lapses and speaks approvingly of a " contract between a people and its government , " as in pre-revolutionary America. ) 35 To make a claim for the praiseworthy distinctiveness of representative democracy , as against Arendt 's denigrations in On Revolution , we must recapture some of the arguments found or implied in this conceptualization . The heart of the matter is that an electoral system changes the nature of political authority . Even though only a comparatively small number of citizens hold elective office , and most are thus not regular participants in the political system , filling the main nonjudicial offices by ( contested ) election qualitatively changes the relationship between government and the people . The first way of describing the change is to say , following suggestions made by the Levellers , that every time there is an election to fill national offices the government is being made anew , being reconstituted . The electoral procedure itself ? the constitutional rules specifying the offices and the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the offices themselves are held only temporarily and can be filled only by regular election . They would remain unfilled otherwise . No one person or group can claim them as a matter of right . No individual has any title to office other than what successful contest gives him . He owes what he has to the choice of the relevant constituency . An individual who votes in an election renews his membership in society and thus affirms his voluntary membership . An election is a form in which each individual says to the rest that he is still one with them and with their common purpose , which is to live together on certain terms , and implicitly to acknowledge the necessity of having a government or political authority . At the same time , the group of individuals as a whole reexpresses its voluntary corporate character , and as a whole , it does what only the whole can do : It periodically reconstitutes political authority . This is the most important meaning of consent of the governed . That there must be disagreement for an election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unanimous vote , does not affect the claim here made . Political authority can have no other existence but a periodically renewed one ; just as society itself is not a prison , not a conquest , but a freely willed creation . The electoral procedure thus provides a way of acknowledging the autonomy of every individual and of the people as a whole . Whatever the actual or fictional nature of an original creation of society by the consent of contracting individuals , the electoral procedure is a method for making the continuation of society the result of such consent . On the assumption that without a government no society could long endure , the act of filling the offices of government is in itself the re-creation of society . Thus , by this view , we argue for the reality of the consensual character of society by reference to the form of government , rather than beginning with an original act // of creation of society and then , by a doctrine of necessary human rationality , deducing the form of government . Of course , participatory democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieves the same effect . But representative democracy does too . Since it does ( if it does ) , it can not be associated with passivity , or at least not in the measure that Arendt suggests . How can there be a mere consent to be governed implicit in the workings of the electoral procedure ? How can one think that where there is an electoral procedure the moral equality and equal standing of government with the people , or even worse , that a contractual relationship between " a people and its ruler " is being proclaimed ? Representative democracy in its innermost meaning is at war with any such reification of political authority , any intimation that the people may be understood as having permanently alienated their involvement in the constitution of political authority , just as it is at war with the idea that a reified society is above its members , greater in its dignity and morally and metaphysically superior in its interests and purposes . A further moral consequence may be asserted . The regular workings of the electoral procedure comprise a chastening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of the people , political authority loses all majesty . The mystique of etatisme , with all the punitive and regulative horrors it spawns , withers . The result is a heightened readiness to resist authority , to resist government , when office-holders forget who they are , when they forget that they are servants of the people . All kinds of authority in a society that has a genuine electoral procedure are chastened , robbed of their majesty , by the force of the transparent public example of chastening undergone by public authority . But Arendt is largely averse to a democratization of authority relations outside the public sphere ? as , for example , in the work place or in schools . So we must confine ourselves to the public sphere . When we do , we must say that the phenomenon of civil disobedience is almost entirely the moral result of the changed attitudes toward public authority induced by the electoral procedure ( and by its proper accompaniment , a system of constitutional restrictions on the exercise of such authority ) . Civil disobedience flows from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstantial chastening of political authority when office-holders fail to acknowledge or show they are aware of the meaning of the regular workings of the electoral procedure . It adds an episodic and circumstantial chastening to a constitutive , not to say a ritualistic , one . What must be emphasized is that without the initial sense that the electoral procedure is a continuous lesson in the meaning of political authority , civil disobedience could not be conceptually prepared for . Nor could it be psychologically or experientially prepared for . By common understanding , civil disobedience is an act of resistance against moral atrocity or official lawlessness , or both at once . From the time of Paine and Burke forward , representative democracy itself has been theorized as a system of resistance ? benign , non violent revolution institutionalized . The talents and energies democratic revolution elicits and enlarges are , in Paine 's account , regularized and made civil by the regular workings of the electoral procedure . Although Paine stressed citizenly vigilance against a mistrusted // executive power , he suggested something more . He expected animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of some to resist the decisions of others by raising questions and forcing compromises . Effort and resistance and counterresistance are intrinsic to the system . The modes of adversariness are multiple : individual versus government , people versus government , group versus group , office-holders versus office-holders , individual versus society acting through government . ( Adversariness is related to the agon of economic politics . ) Naturally , the public understanding of political authority is dramatically altered when political authority is so unrelentingly caught up in such contention , such disagreement , such readiness to oppose and resist , to claim and contend . That is not to say , as Arendt in fact does , that civil disobedience is basically another form of group politics . Rather , the regular political life of representative democracy , whose skeleton is the electoral procedure , is a constant invitation to challenge political authority and , if need be , to resist it . To have said all this is perhaps to have said the main thing in regard to Arendt and her theoretical relation to representative democracy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fosters , or encourages popular resistance to itself when it fails to be itself . Not even direct democracy does that ; its solidary nature prevents it . " The law is only a memorandum , " said Emerson in his essay " Politics . " It is also true that groups of civil disobedients are a memorandum to the law-makers and other office-holders . If , as Emerson also said , " Good men must not obey the laws too well , " because the law sullies what it commands just by commanding it , it is then also the case that good men will not obey profoundly bad laws or be accomplices in bad policies . The whole being of representative democracy impresses these sentiments or strengthens them . If one large part of Arendt 's life 's work is to disclose the nature of political atrocity and to praise whatever it is that offers discouragement to its emergence or resistance to its unfolding , then we have a right to expect that she regard representative democracy with a kinder eye . Arendt says at one point that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented criminality was almost unchallenged . " 36 It is fair to say that in some representative democracies the words " almost unchallenged " could not be applied to atrocities . That representative democracies should commit atrocities may perhaps be thought a much larger fact than that they are challenged . Indeed , some of the atrocities may derive from the passions encouraged or unleashed by popular political involvement . Yet if no society is incapable of atrocity , only a few are capable of mounting steady resistance . And only in representative democracy is such resistance a mode of allegiance to the spirit of the form of government . That constitutional guarantees make resistance comparatively unhazardous must of course be acknowledged . To resist , therefore , becomes obligatory . The absence of resistance becomes blameworthy . Also , to cooperate with or be reconciled to one 's own victimization runs counter to its spirit and is also blameworthy : again , another effect that should have commended itself to Arendt . How can we associate passivity with representative democracy ? Modern Democracy 133 Obligation and Obedience The other main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , her theoretical account of civil disobedience , is also marked by avoidance and subtle denigration . We have taken up her analysis of civil disobedience as political action and the considerations that she thinks properly animate it . Here we should examine the way in which the phenomenon of civil disobedience in America leads her to general reflections on obligation and obedience , consent and law . Once again , her exposition is stimulating , but it is also unsettling to anyone who wishes to hold on to representative democracy as at least the " second best " form , and perhaps as better than that . Notice at the outset that in " Civil Disobedience , " Arendt is no more willing to trace the readiness to resist atrocity to the spirit of representative democracy than she is in On Revolution . Obviously many who have thought about civil disobedience have begun with the sense that it is a morally questionable activity because it involves lawbreaking : thus all lawbreaking , whether or not from personal impulses , is deemed suspect because the status of a law or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that whatever may be the status of the law in oligarchies or party or military dictatorships , it surely deserves to be obeyed in representative democracies ? more exactly , in constitutional representative democracies . The form of government makes a difference to the status of the law and hence to the philosophical treatment of the question of disobedience . It does not seem that Arendt thinks that the law 's status is affected by the form of government from which it issues . That disobedience takes place in a representative democracy is of no special importance . It acquires a special importance in America not because its government is representative , but because it is constitutional . It acquires a general importance because Arendt thinks that wherever law exists as something regular and rational it must be obeyed if life is to have some certainty amid inevitable change.37 Our concern is with her view that civil disobedience is especially morally problematic and philosophically interesting because America , the first and only true home of civil disobedience , has a constitutional order . Arendt writes as if the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arendt is willing to work with the notion of consent in " Civil Disobedience . " But consent now means something other than the mere consent to be governed ( in exchange for protection , for the right to pursue private happiness ) . It is linked to the obligation to obey the law . It is also linked to one of two main kinds of political contract , indeed to a Lockean contract that Arendt had earlier associated with political passivity or abdication . She is clear that she wishes to find theoretical support for the obligation to obey the law , not simply an undefended or reflexive readiness to obey . Or at least she is now willing ( for the most part ) to employ without reluctance the categories of obligation and obedience . To put it more accurately : She suggests that if there is consent , there then will be an obligation to obey . She insists that the notion of consent is difficult to elaborate and defend plausibly and coherently ; she also knows that contract as the modality of binding consent is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience indicate a new commitment to deal strenuously with lawbreaking , and if finally she is determined to defend lawbreaking in the form of civil disobedience , she will do so only after reasoning with concepts that seem remote from the theorization of political action at its best . Despite her strenuousness , the upshot of her discussion may nevertheless be to take the matter of lawbreaking too lightly . If there is consent , there then will be an obligation to obey the law . Questions arise . Who consents ? To what is consent properly given ? Why does consent oblige ? What justifies the temporary renunciation of the obligation to obey and thus the performance of acts of civil disobedience ? WHO CONSENTS ? Arendt 's unit of consent , so to speak , is the individual . Individual self-binding consent is given by means of a contract with others . Arendt endorses the view that we should understand society as the result of a contract made by individuals . She is aware of the conventional reproach that the social contract is a fiction . But she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and historically " it is not correct " existentially and theoretically . " 38 Certainly American experience , beginning in colonial times , imparts an experiential veracity to the idea of social contract . Although Arendt says that there are two main kinds of contract ( mentioning a third , the Biblical covenant , which is not actively present in her analysis ) , the kinds are described in a different manner from that of On Revolution . She uses the terms vertical and horizontal to designate the two contrasting contracts . As in On Revolution , one kind of contract is prized while another is seen as a theoretical expression of a disturbing reality . But there is no doubt that she has changed her understanding of what theorists of " aboriginal " contract in the seventeenth century and later intended . In truth , she has more than changed ? she has engaged in a sort of reversal . The vertical contract , which she now associates with Hobbes only , is summarized in the language she had used in On Revolution to depict the contract that registers consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke as well as Hobbes . In the vertical contract " every individual concludes an agreement with the strictly secular authority to insure his safety , for the protection of which he relinquishes all rights and powers . " 39 The horizontal contract is Locke 's theoretical contribution . It creates society , not government . The horizontalness consists in the mutuality of contracting individuals who agree henceforth to live together on certain terms . Arendt says that the Lockean contract is one of promises : a people freely creates itself out of individuals rather than clustering together on a basis of " historical memories or ethnic homogeneity , " or simply succumbing to Leviathan 's superior force.40 After the social contract , in a separate step , individuals " contract for their government . ' Although in On Revolution she had found in Locke 's conceptualization a sense of mutuality codified by promising , she thought that Locke had disregarded this aspect in favor of a larger purpose . That purpose was to establish a government for the sake of // protection , a purpose that she believes is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal participants , whose loyalty to each other is memorialized in the original agreement . Locke is now , however , the master theoretician . More than that , American political thought and experience must be seen by reference to his horizontal contract . American society is founded by a social contract of equals . There is no contract between a people and its government . It would seem that , from the point of view of one trying to assert the praiseworthy distinctiveness of representative democracy , Arendt had made some advance toward accommodation . But that is deceptive , as becomes apparent when we look at her answer to the second question . TO WHAT IS CONSENT PROPERLY GIVEN ? Another way of asking the question is , What should each individual expect to come out of the entire consensual process in both its steps ? What kind of society and what kind of government are suitable objects of expectation ? For those denied the opportunity of explicit creation because they are born into a settlement , what kind of society and what kind of government , by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What institutions would deserve to be created if they did not already exist ? Arendt 's answer to these equivalent questions is a proper constitution . That is , even though she sometimes says there are two separate steps , indeed two separate contractual steps , her main answer is that the content of the social contract is a constitution , with the will of individuals to live together as a society necessarily implied . The founding generation in America needed only one step : All at once the population decided on a new constitution ( to replace an earlier , looser one ) , which created a new society continuous with the old . But two steps are certainly conceptualized by Locke . As for individuals in generations after the founding , the question of voluntary membership is ideally answered by reference to whether the constitution is worthy of support . Altogether , Arendt helps us see that a written ( and formally amendable ) constitution gives reality to the idea of social contract . ( explicit terms of agreement ) , just as the worthiness of the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription to the contract ( voluntary membership ) . Arendt does not give a schematic rendering of the term constitution . Nevertheless , her understanding of a constitution develops by accumulation as well as by implication . Her intellectual inspiration throughout is the American Constitution . She means that a constitution stands for a general lawfulness , the rule of law , and that in addition it guarantees the right of individuals and groups to dissent . She also indicates , by reference to the plight of black Americans , that individuals and groups must be included in the tacit welcome or acceptance that society grants to succeeding generations . Thus a constitution is lawfulness , the right of dissent , and full acceptance of each person by the rest . Where these conditions are met , Arendt would say that a society originated in a horizontal contract of freely consenting individuals ; but // more important , it endures because of the consent of the individuals who comprise it . The constitution obliges to obedience and to something more robust than mere dutiful obedience ? to support . This support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws into existence to begin with . " 42 One question that arises is , Do these conditions taken together in fact establish what she is looking for , the politics of consent : the continuous renewal of an individual 's consent to society , the serially given consent of individuals as they come of age , and the regular consent of the people to what government does ? It seems not . How could we say that a society rests on consenting membership , and that it was worthy of doing so , unless we saw in its political workings the involvement of the supposedly consenting individuals ? How could we say that a people " supports " ( in an active sense ) the laws unless they took part in their making ? The electoral procedure of representative democracy is a way of periodically renewing the social contract by reconstituting political authority . But the electoral procedure attains another result pertinent to the concept of consent . The procedure by which offices are filled through contested elections is eo ipso the procedure that helps to determine the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental conduct . One necessary condition for saying that a society originated in consent and endures by consent is that political authority is regularly reconstituted . Another necessary condition is that the people actively help to set fundamental outlines and limits . The usual view is that the electoral procedure of representative democracy meets these two conditions . Put another way , the only valid social contract is one that creates or issues in a democratic constitution . In fact , Americans contractually created a society by creating a democratic constitution , even if imperfectly democratic originally , and still . Individual consent to society is a different sort of consent from popular consent to public policy and governmental conduct . If individuals did not consent to society , there would either be anarchy or conquest . The choice to consent is shadowed by unattractive alternatives . The whole point is to make the choice to consent to society as real as possible by making society be more than the desperate avoidance of anarchy ; and to make it resemble as little as possible the systemization of conquest . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowed by unattractive alternatives . If the people do not consent , if they disagree , their citizenship can be used to induce change . If they agree , their consent is not mere assent or acquiescence : The possibility of dissent enhances the meaning of consent . And their consent is not mere assent or acquiescence for another reason . The electoral procedure makes their consent active , makes it even more than " support . " It makes consent into a politics that works to determine the content of consent . The people give titles to offices , but not blanket permission ; office-holders can not say , " take it or leave it . " What the electoral procedure does so far as outlines for and limits on official conduct are concerned is create the people as a new unit of consent ( besides the individual ) . Membership in society must be voluntary for every individual ; // ideally , any proposal that effected a radical change in the terms of the social contract would require the consent of every individual ; every individual must be politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual may be said to retain a moral right of veto in all matters threatening conscience . Autonomy requires all these , as well as the largest possible area of individually determined conduct . But in regard to the more normal laws and policies enacted , in regard to the dailiness of representative democracy , the individual can no longer be thought of as the relevant unit of consent . The establishment of society by a social contract creates , at least for some theoretical purposes , a people : the group of governed , those whose obligation to obey laws and policies is a derivation of the social contract . The law is not a singular imposition on a particular individual ; it is made to be the same law for all . The unit of obligation is always the individual , even though the unit of consent is the group . An individual 's autonomy is abridged not when he must obey a law he disagrees with ( except in cases of conscientious disagreement ) , but when he is not allowed to vote or denied other political rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agreement and disagreement . If he agrees , he may not feel the obligation . His wishes and his obligation may coincide . But he is not merely doing the thing he wants to do when he obeys a law he agrees with , but doing what all must do . Individual agreement with a law or policy does not make obligation otiose , any more than disagreement nullifies obligation.43 A people 's autonomy , on the other hand , is abolished when it must obey laws and policies imposed on it without the use of the electoral procedure ( in the absence of direct democracy ) . The key consideration is that government not do what it wants on its own . Its independent will would make the people heteronomous , whether or not they agreed with its laws and policies . If laws and policies are made by consent , they are made by the consent of all the governed , the corporate people . For any particular enactment , the consent of the governed must mean the consent of the constitutional majority . Disagreement and division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , not unanimity , which on almost all matters would be a sign of homogeneous sickness . Hence the people 's autonomy is not perfectly analogous to an individual 's . Obviously many laws and policies are made without citizenly involvement before the enactment , or without citizenly judgment after it , or they are made at the behest of a few only , for good purpose or bad . A people 's relation to its consent is therefore not as steady as an individual 's to his . Representative government undeniably establishes distance between the people and what it has consented to . In that distance , both individual obligation and the strain on it grow ? although even where the people make the laws directly , the concept of obligation is still in place . The ever-changing majority must have its ( constitutional ) way because the principle of equality requires it ; not because , as Arendt opaquely says , " the principle of majority is inherent in the very process of decision-making . " 44 The only alternative is morally unacceptable , inegalitarian , minority rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This kind of consent , this consent of the governed concerning normal laws and policies , can not exist // outside democracy , direct or representative . The claim is that it not only exists in direct democracy but also in representative democracy because of the latter 's electoral procedure . Arendt says , that " Consent , in the American understanding of the term , relies on the horizontal version of the social contract , and not on majority decisions . " ( emphasis added. ) 45 The truth may be rather that a system ofmajority decisions helps to demonstrate the plausibility of a horizontal contract . Arendt 's theory of the politics of consent proceeds altogether differently . She is surely ingenious : We all live and survive by a kind of tacit consent , which , however , it would be difficult to call voluntary . How can we will what is there anyhow ? We might call it voluntary , though , when the child happens to be born into a community in which dissent is also a legal and de facto possibility once he has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallmark of free government ; one who knows that he may dissent knows also that he somehow consents when he does not dissent . Consent as it is implied in the right to dissent ? the spirit of American law and the quintessence of American government ? spells out and articulates the tacit consent given in exchange for the community 's tacit welcome of new arrivals.46 In one stroke Arendt renders the form of government a matter of indifference . She eliminates the form of government from the set of conditions that have to be met if we are to say that the consent of individuals creates and re-creates a society and that group consent keeps it in motion . She makes a brilliant move in claiming that it is dissent that makes an otherwise tacit consent explicit . In regard to young dissenters , whether or not they are civil disobedients , she is saying that their first political word is no , and this no is also their first explicit yes . This move is only one example of a fine resourcefulness manifest in the essay . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral procedure in resolving the question of obligation by giving reality to individual and group consent . As we saw , Arendt is willing to allow that consent of the governed in America is not consent " in the very old sense of mere acquiescence , with its distinction between rule over willing subjects and rule over unwilling ones , but in the sense of active support and continuing participation in all matters of public interest . " 47 However , her pervasive implication is that support and participation are expressed only through unstructured associative activity , including its " latest form , " civil disobedience.48 She makes no mention of the simple fact that such activity is not purely ad hoc . Without the existence of the electoral procedure , supportive and participatory activity would have no starting point , no framework , no source of articulation , no coherence , no focus , no ultimate object of attention , passion , and aspiration . One might say that she willfully omits the structural sine qua non of action she admires , just as she willfully omits its psychological sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no credit . This omission also makes her approach to our next question seriously detrimental to representative democracy and hence to some considerable part of what she values . Modern Democracy 139 WHY DOES CONSENT OBLIGE ? What is involved here is the consent given by each individual to the social contract ; that is , one 's voluntary membership . Arendt argues , and correctly , that such consent is the only kind that is morally required for a general obligation carried by each individual to obey the laws . But to require individual consent or agreement to every law is to misunderstand law as a singular imposition . Obligation is not created ab initio every time a law or policy is made . A law or policy possesses its status as law or policy only because it is the result of some established political structure . The social contract ( or acceptance of a constitution ) creates consent to all future ( valid ) laws and policies , understood as the results of an established political structure , a government . It would lack meaning if it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obey . Yes , the individual must consent to be governed , must consent to be obliged . He need not stay in a society under a democratic constitution ; but if he freely stays , he is obliged . But why does consent oblige ? Why is it not only necessary but sufficient for obligation ? Arendt simply says , " pacta cunt servanda. " 49 She elaborates : The moral content of this consent is like the moral content of all agreements and contracts ; it consists in the obligation to keep them . This obligation is inherent in all promises . Every organization of men , be it social or political , ultimately relies on man 's capacity for making promises and keeping them . The only strict moral duty of the citizen is this twofold willingness to give and keep reliable assurances as to his future conduct , which forms the prepolitical condition of all other , specifically political , virtues . ' 0 Such an argument is right only for particular transactions . The argument is formalist , and a formalist argument can not establish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more " moral content " to the social contract than its own contractual nature . Its content is a constitution . Arendt herself has set down conditions for a constitution , the political instrument that , as of right , should be created by the social contract ( or after it is made ) . But we must go farther . We may speak of an individual 's proper consent , and hence of its binding force , only if he is guaranteed political rights as a citizen who may take part in the politics of the process by which the governed share in the making of laws and policies . Although his involvement may count for little ( and that is up to him to some degree ) , the system of popular consent counts immeasurably for him , not only for his well-being , but for his identity and status as a person . Arendt 's constitution comprises too scanty a provisioning of the consent of the governed . When consent means consent to an all-inclusive commitment like membership in society , it can be inferred only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being pledged to . The worthiness is defined in some significant part by reference to the very principle present in the insistence on grounding membership in consent : autonomy as self-imposition of obligation . ' ' Of course , one is not directly exercising autonomy just by being a member of an autonomous people , whether in direct or representative democracy . But is it not true that one 's autonomy is abridged if the people , of // whom one is a member , do not guide and instruct law-making and policy-making ? The two kinds of autonomy go only together . To insist that original individual consent is morally necessary requires us also to insist that continuous group consent is morally necessary , even though individual autonomy is conceptually distinct from group autonomy . The social contract goes consistently only with democracy . The danger of a narrow conception of the bindingness of consent ( even if the conception is not merely formalist ) is that it all too easily allows casual complaints that the social contract is meaningless . The idea that one could make an irrevocable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comply and to sacrifice , with no guarantee that the source of those demands will be a government periodically re-created and periodically instructed by the people , is an incredible one . Consent without democracy does not oblige ; it can not be understood as consent . But we have only representative democracy available to us . Another aspect of Arendt 's thought works with a similar tendency to dissolve obligation by severing laws and obligation . She sees laws in a certain way : " All laws are " directives " rather than " imperatives . " ' They direct human intercourse as the rules direct the game.i52 But can a law imposing , say , conscription really be seen that way ? Furthermore , in On Revolution , Arendt seems to endorse the Roman view that authority was not vested in the laws , but rather " incorporated in a political institution , the Roman Senate . " She also says that the Founding Fathers were unwilling " to endow with authority a branch of the legislature ... The true seat of authority in the American Republic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been unambiguous about American constitutional understanding when only a far more equivocal argument should be offered concerning the location of authority in American political life . Of course , the Supreme Court has the ( provisional ) last word on the meaning of the Constitution ; and the Constitution is , among other things , equivalent to a social contract and hence the authoritative formulation of the terms of the original understanding . But a thousand different laws and policies have been made and will be made by Congress and other agencies . These , too , are authoritative enactments . They are enactments of legitimate authority ( subject always to constitutional scrutiny ) . The idea of law or policy is inextricably joined to a law-making or policy-making body . Of course , there must be an investment of authority in government , not only in the Supreme Court , the Constitution , or the people , despite the right of the Court ( basing itself on the Constitution ) and , ultimately , the right of the people to constrain and inhibit political authority , and despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of the electoral procedure . How could we speak of an obligation to obey the law in a modern society unless we posited the existence of political authority ? Furthermore , how could we speak of civil disobedience if there were not authoritative enactments that were normally obeyed ? Civil disobedience , from the nature of the practice itself , is a special medicine that would turn into poison if it were used continuously . If its continuousness were morally // justifiable , we would be in a situation in which something more drastic than civil disobedience would be morally justifiable , namely , revolution . It is only against a background of something like legitimacy ( politically institutionalized ) that civil disobedience ( on the American model ) can truly exist . WHAT JUSTIfiES CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ? In the absence of the idea of political authority , the status of this question becomes uncertain . What are individuals or a group doing when they disobey the law ? How serious is noncriminal , nonselfish lawbreaking ? Arendt suggests that lawbreaking is wrong because it signifies that one has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen , she believes with an unusual intensity that not keeping one 's word is a grave offense . One harms all other parties to the social contract ; one harms one 's fellow citizens . The harm lies not only in injurious consequences but also in the inherent injustice of not keeping one 's word , the injustice that consists in preferring oneself , in thinking oneself better than others.54 I would gladly subscribe to this conceptualization in order to avoid any possibility of finding the wrong of lawbreaking in lese majeste , in harm done political authority . Government ( to give political authority its more familiar name ) is not a separate entity with entitlements : as Paine reminds us , contra Hobbes , government has no rights , only duties . One could of course say that if we expect office-holders to feel obliged to act by and within the laws and the Constitution , we must , for consistency 's sake , expect the same of citizens . But can we sustain that sense without trying to show as persuasively as possible , in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of the social contract but also , on any specific occasion , a violation of the majority principle ( constrained by constitutional limits ) ? To violate the majority principle , where it is appropriate , is to reject human equality , understood as equal human worth . To break a law-is-thus not only to break faith with all those with whom one is freely tied in a contract . It is also to show one 's contempt for their moral status as one 's fellows . The majority principle is inherent in the consent of the governed , consent entailed by the social contract . But it also has independent standing . Equal human worth is conceptually distinct from an equal right to autonomy : To count for one and no more than one is distinct from being equally entitled to join or refuse to join with others in a horizontal social contract . The obligation to obey therefore has a double source : the social contract and equal human worth . Lawbreaking is both a contractual violation and a direct violation of respect for others . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It is often argued that the consent to the Constitution , the consensus universalis , implies consent to statutory laws as well , because in representative government the people have helped to make them . This consent , I think , is indeed entirely fictitious ; under the present circumstances , at any rate , it has lost all plausibility . ' 5 // Is she saying that if representative government were truly representative she would grant the double nature of lawbreaking , or that the closeness of government action to public will is theoretically immaterial ? The proper assumption would be that where representative government approximates to the will of the constitutional majority , in its laws and policies , and does so not by a mere process of ratification , but by a genuine process of guidance and instruction politically received , lawbreaking implicates one in a complex wrong . Even if violating the law of trespass is a small offense , when large numbers do it , it turns into a large political fact and therefore into a general influence in society , for good and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a way of rejecting and impeding a law or policy that ( at least , by rebuttable presumption ) results from the procedures of constitutional majority decision . This is not to say that Arendt takes lawbreaking lightly . To the contrary . Her sentiments are not in question ; only the ability of her theory to deal with a fundamental issue . Breach of the original contract , apart from its political entailments , does not appear to be sufficiently weighty theoretically or psychologically to discountenance lawbreaking morally . Arendt leaves us with too thin a theory of obligation . In any case , Arendt places the emphasis on her justification of civil disobedience on the failure of the American government to abide by the Constitution . By the Constitution , she means two things in this context : the rule of law and the right of dissent . She finds in the Vietnam War lawless executive conduct , the lawlessness of which she illustrates by reference to the waging of an undeclared war , encroachments by secret agencies , invasions of First Amendment rights , and executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last resort against official lawlessness . When Congress acquiesces , and the Supreme Court abstains from exercising judicial review , civil disobedience is the way to protest and impede . Arendt does not fully ponder the irony of responding to lawlessness with lawbreaking , although it is not foreign to her analysis to suggest that to support lawless decisions is to be in complicity with the initial lawlessness , and that it is only by refusing complicity with a lawless pattern of activity by outwardly illegal conduct that one obeys valid law or stays faithful to the spirit of the laws , to the spirit of the Constitution , to the terms of the original contract . There is an echo of the Lockean assertion that bad rulers are the real rebels . I have said , in the preceding chapter , that there is something anemic in confining , as Arendt does , the justification of civil disobedience during the Vietnam war to considerations of the unconstitutional or anticonstitutional behavior of office-holders . The basis is too narrow ; it excludes the kind of horror or indignation that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations . But if the passional basis is too narrow , the overt specification of general reasons that Arendt gives is , contrastingly , too broad perhaps . This broadness is facilitated by her rejection of the view that laws and policies ultimately emanate from the ( constitutional ) will of the majority , from the consent of the governed . Believing that we are obliged to obey the law only because we have all given a general promise to do so , and // that keeping promises is indispensable to most of what is precious in life , she nevertheless is rather permissive in her vindication of principled lawbreaking : Civil disobedience arises when ... either .. . the normal channels of change no longer function , and grievances will not be heard or acted upon , or that , on the contrary , the government is about to change and has embarked upon and persists in modes of action whose legality and constitutionality are open to grave doubt .... In other words , civil disobedience can be tuned to necessary and desirable change or to necessary and desirable preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights guaranteed under the First Amendment , or the restoration of the proper balance of power in the government . ' One worry is the formulation , " tuned to necessary and desirable change . " It is too loose and permits the introduction of self-interested or self-regarding motives ; it threatens to substitute for the lawful and authorized resolution of necessarily disputed issues a continuously irregular and finally illegitimate mode . Arendt 's permissiveness culminates in the suggestion that the American legal system and perhaps even the Constitution itself ( by a new amendment ) " find a recognized niche for civil disobedience in our institutions of government . " S8 She agrees that " the law can not justify the violation of the law , " 59 but she insists that finding a niche is not the same as legalizing illegality . She goes so far as to say that finding a niche would be an event " of no less significance , perhaps , than the event of the founding of the constitutio libertatis , nearly two hundred years ago.i60 It would be preferable if she had recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are dealing with , say , trespass as a tactic of protest , of indirect civil disobedience . But such leniency is one thing ; a more formal niche is quite another . Not only would a less inhibited citizenry loosen further the inhibitions of office-holders in regard to obeying the law and the Constitution , but a regularization of civil disobedience would dim the meaning of the activity , render it less serious , less heroic , less potent as a method of chastisement of authority and instruction in the future . But more important yet is the violation done the majority principle by a lawbreaking that strays beyond the strictest moral and/or constitutional necessity . Obviously there is nothing morally problematic in any act of direct civil disobedience : the refusal to obey a law or policy whose content is clearly criminal . What authority never had the right to command , no one has a duty or right to do ; and to punish such disobedience doubles the criminality . Arendt 's main interest is in indirect civil disobedience , and as she suggests , the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the central source of complexity is not the harm done by , say , those who trespass , but the readiness to believe that for vague reasons one can break some law or other without defaulting on the general obligation to be law-abiding in a representative democracy . Only if it could be shown that representative democracy is not a democracy at all , or is a facade for oligarachy , or is only feebly or remotely or infrequently a democracy , could such an attitude toward disobedience be acceptable . Arendt does not accept the radical critique of representative democracy in any // of these versions , except in a casual way here and there . ' She simply reasons with scant reference to the impact of the electoral procedure on the status of laws and policies . The result is as theoretically threatening to representative democracy as the radical critique . Arendt 's theory works indeliberately yet consistently to loosen the plausibility of the sense of obligation . Imperfect Legitmacy For all that could be said in behalf of the idea that the electoral procedure is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the argument is itself seriously problematic . Even if we left aside both the radical critique and Arendt 's passing judgment on popular consent as " fictitious , " the plain truth is that laws and policies are expressions of the will ( and judgment ) of the constitutional majority in at best an approximate way . Often we could not speak of approximation , but we would have to say that the connection to the people is tenuous and sometimes nonexistent . The total picture is heterogeneous and shifting . Some of the causes of this partial remoteness are structural : for example , the very fact of representation establishes some discontinuity between government and the people ; clearly office-holders have a large amount of discretion and the preponderant amount of initiative . Another major structural cause is unequal political power and influence among citizens , traceable to unequal economic and cultural power . Some of the causes are substantive : Many areas of policy , but especially foreign policy , ultimately the most important area , are not easily amenable , if amenable at all , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes are circumstantial : For example , particular office-holders may be transgressive or lawless , unresponsive , needlessly secretive , successfully corrupt . The net result is that the most we can say is that representative democracy is only to some degree the system of popular rule or the system of the consent of the governed . From that analytic result it may follow that the obligation to obey laws and policies is , at all times , only imperfect ? as imperfect as the system qua system of consent is . The first two sorts of causes of remoteness loosen obligation ; the last sort may suspend it on particular occasions . Of course , all laws that codify basic morality and all laws that merely create morally indifferent conventions , such as traffic regulations , are not touched in their bindingness . But many laws and policies are neither morally categorical nor merely expedient . They are disputable , discretionary judgments . They present themselves as equally binding , but the process of their making imperfectly manifests the politics of popular consent . The more active government is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how successful its policies just as the more purposive politics is , the smaller the role of citizenship becomes . Mere disagreement does not entitle an individual or group to disobey just because the process is imperfect . We could say , however , that the sense of obligation needs to be reinforced by something else ; namely , a sense of duty . If a general obligation derives from rationally imputed personal consent to a good social contract , duty derives from a less well-defined claim on oneself.62 // The point of saying this is that if Arendt is not strict enough in defining obligation , there are limits to how strict anyone can be , if not in direct democracy , then certainly in representative democracy . But if we believe that representative democracy is distinctively praiseworthy and therefore deserves support and loyalty , we may want to add , if we can do it with propriety , a sense of duty to a sense of imperfect obligation . The hope is ? it may be either quixotic or theoretically unallowable ? that duty will compensate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition to consider all laws and policies , except wicked or evil ones , as binding . What must be shown is that representative democracy deserves the effort to execute the strategem . From Arendt 's perspective we could say that representative democracy deserves support and loyalty ? and hence a general law-abidingness that rests on more than a promise contractually given , as it were once and for all ? because it inculcates the spirit of resistance to atrocity and hence to itself when aberrant . To keep that spirit alive we must keep representative democracy alive . To keep it alive we must act as if it were completely legitimate , as if its politics were purely the politics of consent . We must consider its laws and policies as authoritative , as coming from political authority guided and instructed by the people . Sustaining us , however , would be a sense of duty , commonly discussed as owed to praiseworthy institutions ? praiseworthy apart from the problem of legitimacy , apart from questions of consent and obligation , but never to be taken as praiseworthy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimacy is present in them . The obvious fact to point to is constitutionalism , the Bill of Rights . There is a duty to preserve constitutionalism , understood , however , not only as a conceptually required accompaniment to the electoral procedure but also as valuable for nonpolitical reasons . This is especially true of free speech and expression . The preservation of constitutionalism is tied to the preservation of representative democracy . To indicate the praiseworthiness of representative democracy yet more largely , we would have to depart from Arendt 's perspective , as well as from some of her stated likes and dislikes . We would try to show that the electoral procedure ( combined with constitutionalism ) fosters in all relations of life several commendable moral phenomena that , together , conduce to the emergence of a certain kind of culture . These phenomena include : independence , in the twofold sense of a wish to be autonomous ( to lead one 's own life , to make one 's own soul ) and of a disposition to say no , to resist inclusion in collective mindlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human relations as lend themselves to a greater citizenly equality ; a wish to ensure that all relations are characterized by the delicacies of constitutionalism , not only fairness but compunctions , hesitations , and avoidances that figure , for example , in amendments four through eight in the American Constitution ; and a sense of moral indeterminacy , a sense that though there are absolute limits , a voluptuous uncertainty as to how to judge and what to think and what , even , to want , both is a sign of life and is life itself.63 // Thoreau as no-sayer is an emblematic figure , but there are others ; some , like Whitman 's Myself , are more spontaneous and abundant . In the first instance , the idea of the culture of representative democracy is resistance , yet the encouragement of resistance is paradoxically dependent on the health of its political institutions . They must be regarded better than Arendt regards them . With some strain perhaps , one could also try to demonstrate that resistance is not likely to be a salient trait of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although they are not merely instrumental to the spirit of resistance , they grow best in the same soil as the spirit of resistance . They all grow together . Therefore , to praise resistance may commit one to a warmer appreciation of other phenomena that belong to the same family as resistance . And then beyond resistance ? and Arendt would be the first to say that life is more than resistance ? the other commendable phenomena that representa tive democracy sponsors , fosters , or shelters are valuable for themselves . At this point , the fact of a theorist 's temperament must assert itself . Arendt dislikes two tendencies in modern democratic life that naturally emerge from these itemized dispositions . She has no patience with the effort to democratize human relations outside the public arena ; and she shows immense skepticism to individuality , which in its positive expression includes autonomy . On the one hand , she is certain that all activities but politics are governed by standards that disallow the presumptuousness of unequal learners and amateurs claiming equality with masters and practitioners . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much to have any feeling for individual efforts at unpolitical self-realization through conduct that differentiates and distances each from the rest . She says approvingly , " It is in the nature of a group and its power to turn against independence , the property of individual strength . " ? 4 Yet the culture of representative democracy blesses both individuality and the democratization of all human relations . To turn against them is to be averse to representative democracy , but it is also to be averse to some of the more humane possibilities of life in the modern age . Chapter Five Modernity Arendt says that her aim in The Human Condition is to reconsider " the human condition from the vantage point of our newest experiences and our most recent fears . " ' In truth , her whole life 's work is spent on such reconsideration . Her intellectual passion is devoted to distilling the meaning of modernity , of the new . Even when she tries to penetrate the Greek and the Roman understanding of political action , her ambition is more one of retrieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer may engage in " hidden self-interpretation " 2 when interpreting another ( as Broch did in writing on Kafka ) , she does the same in writing about Walter Benjamin . She says : Without realizing it , Benjamin actually had more in common with Heidegger 's remarkable sense for living eyes and living bones that had sea-changed into pearls and coral , and as such could be saved and lifted into the present only by doing violence to their context in interpreting them with the " deadly impact " of new thoughts , than he did with the dialectical subtleties of his Marxist friends . ' The " break in our tradition " 4 that helps to define modernity ensures that we can neither be unreflectingly intimate with the past nor imitate it faithfully . Nor does Arendt think we can use the past for the sake of furthering a present practical purpose . There is no learning useful lessons from the past , certainly not from the remote past . She is as far from nostalgia as it is possible to be and still admire . Her aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strangeness of the present ; the unexperienced strangeness of the past is made to throw its light on the unrecognized strangeness of the present . Not only is modernity discontinuous , it is less and less human . To say what is human , she tears " fragments out of their context . " ' She gives a new life to the ancient world so that our new life ? life in the modern world ? is seen for the immense anomaly that it is . Some of " our newest experiences " are the source of , are the equivalent of , " our most recent fears . " Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism in their unprecedented quality are an essential part of the definition of modernity . They are not , in Arendt 's rendering , typical of our period ; they need not have happened . Rather , they could have happened only in the modern age ; they show what only modern Europe was capable of . She does not pretend to know whether anything comparable will happen again . ( Arendt did not live to // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass murder of the innocent was undertaken by non-Europeans infected by a European ideology . ) Yet even if totalitarianism did not recur , the meaning of modernity could not be ascertained without a direct intellectual confrontation with it . If we are right in thinking that no contemporary political theory can be adequate unless it shows that it has let the worst evil leave its mark , then we can say that Arendt 's work survives one of the tests of adequacy . For all the flaws in her analysis , she has done more than anyone else to present totalitarianism as a phenomenon . Of course , encompassment of the worst evil is not the sole work of a contemporary political theorist . Let us say that our full expectation is elucidation of modernity , " the modern " ( to use Walt Whitman 's phrase ) . The assumption behind this expectation is captured in Arendt 's phrase , " break in our tradition . " Modern life is , in fundamental ways , new , strange , discontinuous . This is hardly a fresh thought . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernity ? some of them great or good . Arendt 's work is part of the overall effort . However , because she dares to encompass the worst evil , she is one of the principal theoretical expositors of modernity . But she does more , because more must be done . There is more than one horror and there is more than horror . A rounded sense of modernity will show acquaintance with abysmal depths : but also with heights . It will perhaps suggest whether the same energies that threw humanity into the depths have also made it soar ; and whether or not such a fatal connection exists , to suggest , as well , how to consider those heights . Are they only consolation , or could they be positively worthy ? Or are they , instead , perversity , disguised evil , depths only a fool could think were heights ? Concerning the depths : Arendt 's discussion of totalitarianism reaches beyond itself to other horrors . We can insist on the uniqueness of totalitarianism as methodical and legal genocide and still realize that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its victims suffered , we may find resemblances to other horrors of modern life . Arendt does not insist that the experiences that prepared the way are terrible only because they prepared the way . Nor does she imply that the experiences of dehumanization can happen only in the death camps or in the daily life of a population terrorized by totalitarian dictatorship . Although totalitarianism is a systematic response to a given historical situation , elements of that situation are everywhere around us and can be expected to continue and even worsen . Similarly , elements of the totalitarian response may detach themselves from the system and appear and reappear in various combinations . Arendt holds that totalitarianism could not have come into being unless large numbers of civilized people felt deeply that they were superfluous , or abandoned and lost , or bereft of meaningfulness . But surely these feelings are never out of sight or out of consciousness for long in the modern world . For example , the mere numbers of people alive may weigh nightmarishly on the consciousness of those not used to such crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim passage in the midst of wondering whether crimes similar to totalitarianism will be committed in the future . She worries about the practical uses of apocalypse : // The frightening coincidence of the modern population explosion with the discovery of technical devices that , through automation , will make large sections of the population " superfluous " even in terms of labor , and that , through nuclear energy , make it possible to deal with this twofold threat by the use of instruments beside which Hitler 's gassing installations look like an evil child 's fumbling toys , should be enough to make us tremble . ' She says , most generally and chillingly , that " masses of people are continuously rendered superfluous if we continue to think of our world in utilitarian terms . " 7 The sense of being suffocated or the pain and the pathology of feeling superfluous are part of the story of The Origins of Totalitarianism and Arendt 's other writings on totalitarianism . To read about them there is to be fortified perceptually for their occurrence elsewhere than in the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arendt 's rendering of lostness , or of the craving for meaning in the midst of disorientation , contributes to our general sensitivity to endemic features of modern life . ( This is not to say that these features have not existed in the past . The difference between now and then is that there is now a feeling of having become lost , and a self-conscious and deliberate expectation that one should not be lost or have to endure the void of meaninglessness . ) In short , Arendt 's conception of the conditions exploited by totalitarianism breaks out of its confines productively . It can instruct the imagination of disaster , distress , desolation ; it can help the lucky ones avoid numbness in the face of suffering too great for the categories of normal life . As for the importance of Arendt 's thought to actual victims and survivors , I can not say . Evils and Modernity Arendt 's delineation of the political system of totalitarianism itself enhances our response to political events and arrangements in modern life . On the one hand , the total enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can exist without totalitarian consequences . Mystique is almost never avoided in modern life ; it grows along with both enlightenment and technical rationality . Her essay on the Pentagon Papers ( " Lying in Politics " ) offers a striking characterization of both the problem-solving mentality and the mentality of ex-Communist anti-Communism as instances of ideological enclosure.8 These are just two examples taken from Arendt 's own work . Obviously , she provides a way of addressing comparable manifestations that she does not take up . On the other hand , the intensely modern impulse to believe that " everything is possible " appears apart from totalitarianism as well as in it . Such overreaching may be a more ambiguous tendency than Arendt characteristically allows . On occasion , she is willing to grant that the modern age " has so strangely intertwined the good with the bad . " 9 That sentiment of ambiguity is rare in her work . Yet to follow her in seeing overreaching as intrinsic to totalitarianism is to be prepared at once to see it in other circumstances where it may be only obscurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonic . For that reason , we may find some affinity // between the suggestiveness radiated by Arendt 's theory of totalitarianism and the quite distinct notions of it advanced by Herbert Marcuse in One-Dimensional Man and Norman Mailer in The Presidential Papers and elsewhere . Arendt 's thought encourages hospitality ? perhaps partly in spite of her ? to metaphoric uses of " totalitarianism , " especially where the theorist detects an insidious , illimitable movement of encroachment by " forces " or " the system " or bureaucracies of one kind or another.1 " She may also prepare a reader to receive Foucault 's cognate analyses in his books on punishment and sexuality . Her study of totalitarianism has both inherent worth and indefinite suggestiveness . Besides totalitarianism , Arendt discusses another great evil that helps to define modernity : nuclear weapons . She says that when science " imports cosmic processes into nature , " " a decisive breach opens up between the modern age ( in its trajectory from Copernicus to the early twentieth century ) and the present world ( " the world we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the present age is an acute intensification of moral and intellectual passions that first emerge clearly with Galileo and Descartes : Without actually standing where Archimedes wished to stand ( dos moi you sto ) , still bound to the earth through the human condition , we have found a way to act on the earth and within terrestrial nature as though we dispose of it from the outside , from the Archimedean point . And even at the risk of endangering the natural life process we expose the earth to universal , cosmic forces alien to nature 's household.13 The fruit of the modern Archimedean project is nuclear weapons , the existence of which separates us from all the past . The subject of nuclear weapons is pervasive . No one thinker could possibly have any special relationship to it . It dwarfs even the best as it surpasses all the moral seriousness that may be directed toward it by countless people . It is not a subject , even though another great defining evil ? totalitarianism ? can be transformed , by courageous intelligence , into a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treatment of nuclear weapons in the light of the modern Archimedean project . She doubtless enriches the subject by linking it to something more than its immediate genesis in military ambition ; on the nuclear danger , she may influence other writers , as , for example , Jonathan Schell in The Fate of the Earth . Yet she shows her more typical power in expressing anxiety over the seemingly beneficent response to the threat of nuclear weapons than in articulating the total nature of that threat . If thought about nuclear weapons is an indispensable part of thought about modernity ? indeed , its profoundest part ? Arendt once again demonstrates her relevance to philosophizing about " the human condition from the vantage point of our newest experiences and our most recent fears . " The relevance is at its most pointed , however , when she allows her long-standing concern for the integrity of the political to guide her . In an essay prepared for a volume to honor her revered teacher , " Karl Jaspers : Citizen of the World ? " ( 1957 ) , Arendt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the title . The very idea of being a citizen of the world strikes her as dangerous to human dignity . She exempts Jaspers 's // universalism from complicity with it . Yet she is entirely aware of the temptations that prompt people , Jaspers 's and herself included , to envisage alternatives to the present world situation . The possibility of human extinction in a nuclear war must be contemplated . The point is not to turn to stone , not to be either hopeless or paralyzed by the sense of future enormity . The more important point is not to succumb to the notion of a unitary world state as a solution to the nuclear danger . She says in a slightly too unmodulated sentence : Just as man and woman can be the same , namely human , only by being absolutely different from each other , so the national of every country can enter this world history of humanity only by remaining and clinging stubbornly to what he is . A world citizen , living under the tyranny of a world empire , and speaking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less a monster than a hermaphrodite.14 Arendt discusses only briefly the question taken up by Jaspers in The Future of Mankind ( 1958 ) ; namely , whether a unitary world totalitarian state ( that is , tyranny ) is preferable to human extinction . That is , is Western surrender preferable to mutual extinction ? Jaspers does not give an unequivocal answer , but he seems to incline to the view that the risk of the " final destruction of human existence by the atom bomb " may be worth taking if it were necessary to avoid the " final destruction of the human essence by totalitarianism. " 15 Before the publication of Jaspers 's book , she condemned the view he later inclined to . After its publication , she condemned Jaspers 's way of setting up the alternatives as specious , while unreservedly praising his book in a backnote for being free of mental reservation.16 She said in 1954 : " The moment a war can even conceivably threaten the continued existence of man on earth , the alternative between liberty and death has lost its old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan " better dead than red " and its reverse , she scorns both sides : " The bad faith of the discussants lies in that both dodge the preposterous alternative they themselves have proposed ; they are not serious . " Both sides have a " mental reservation . " One side does not really think that nuclear losses would ever be so great as to destroy free societies irrecoverably . The other side thinks that slavery " will not be so bad " and will eventually succumb to man 's desire for liberation.18 Arendt may , in the later discussion , be evading what she really believes . She seems to turn away from the fact that some on both sides are ruthlessly free of mental reservation . She does repeat her earlier position that no one can sanely think to risk man 's life for the sake of preserving it from universal tyranny , but then she undercuts the position by calling the reverse position equally ridiculous . She hates her real position ; so she states it only once without equivocation and then subsequently tries to analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out when she calls the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki " war crimes . " 19 There are of course harder questions . Suppose that man 's life was not at stake , but instead millions of lives in free and in tyrannical societies , as well as in all the middling regimes on earth . Are losses in the millions to be risked ? tens or hundreds of millions ? for the sake of preventing universal // tyranny ? Tens of millions died in World War II , after all . How much does it matter analytically that they did not die in one exchange of fire , in one or two presses of a button ? that no longlasting ecological trauma accompanied their deaths ? that dying from nuclear weapons may often be a lengthy torture ? Further , can one even speak of preserving free societies in the midst of nuclear ruins ? Is it therefore only a choice between our tyranny and theirs ? Would ours be better because it would be built on the memory of freedom and thus tend to undo itself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blame Arendt for not answering these questions . It is to a theorist 's credit not to try . Consider Arendt analogous analysis of the adage " Let justice be done though the world may perish . " She finds that even Kant could not stomach its real meaning . When , however , truth is put in the place of justice , she says : The sacrifice of truth for the survival of the world would be more futile than the sacrifice of any other principle or virtue . For while we may refuse even to ask ourselves whether life would still be worth living in a world deprived of such notions as justice and freedom , the same , curiously , is not possible with respect to the seemingly so much less political idea of truth .... No permanence , no perseverance in existence , can even be conceived of without men willing to testify to what is and appears to them because it is.20 A world without truthfulness in general is inconceivable . Her point here , however , is not easily imaginable as the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lie and the continuation of all human existence . If that were the choice , she would not hesitate to have the lie spoken . Who would ? ( Who except Kant would refuse to tell a lie in order to save just one innocent person from harm or death ? ) By remote analogy , it would seem that Arendt would prefer the world red than dead . In any case , Arendt , like Jaspers , would never try to have us believe that a desperate answer to an inconceivably vast horror could be , in itself and at the same time , a positive good . She is far away from recent " ecological humanism , " just as she is explicitly remote from sympathy with the idea of a unitary world state , even if merely technocratic rather than cruelly tyrannical . Both " solutions " threaten a human diminution . If necessary , they would still be awful . We must not let fear of the worst abolish our commitment to preserving what is valuable and humanly distinctive . That is the implicit admonition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain fidelity to human plurality . Even a unitary world state that results from peaceful agreement rather than from conquest by a superpower is abhorrent . It corresponds to uniformity of mankind , a universal sameness . Paraphrasing while endorsing Jaspers 's argument , she says : The unity of mankind and its solidarity can not consist in a universal agreement upon one religion , or one philosophy , or one form of government , but in the faith the manifold points to a Oneness which diversity conceals and reveals at the same time.21 She goes so far as to say that if it were true that there was , as the Enlightenment // believed , " a basic human nature underlying the multiplicity of nations , peoples , races , and religions , " then human nature would be " a natural phenomenon . " If that were so , " to call behavior in accordance with it human ' would assume that human and natural behavior are one and the same . " 22 She rejects the assumption . Ultimately , hope may lie in a " framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-wide federated structure . " 23 There would be no more war , and hence the threat of human extinction would disappear , but on terms that do not save humanity while unhumanizing it . Nevertheless , while celebrating Jaspers as a man and thinker by placing him among the small number of those who have risen to the task of reconceiving humanism in a desperate age , Arendt closes the tribute with an expression of distaste even for the political arrangement she has found consonant with such humanism : The abolition of war , like the abolishment of a plurality of sovereign states , would harbor its own peculiar dangers ; the various armies with their old traditions and more or less respected codes of honor would be replaced by federated police forces , and our experience with modern police states and totalitarian governments , where the old power of the army is eclipsed by the rising omnipotence of the police , are not apt to make us overoptimistic about this prospect.2r One might say that it is with relief that Arendt ends the essay in the remark : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant future.i25 She is clearly uncomfortable in the presence of any global project even when attenuated by a genuine humanism and affirmed only when the need seems incontestable . If , then , her work can instruct the imagination of disaster , it by no means seeks to indulge it . The fact is that Arendt 's reluctance , her tentativeness , in discussing any global project reflects one of the basic philosophical convictions inspiring her whole work , which is her rejection of the idea that political action is essentially instrumental , a means to some practically necessary or practically desirable end of a social or economic kind . In the nature of the case , she will be more disposed to face horrors that come from human perversion or human thoughtlessness rather than from human need . If she faces the latter kind at all , she does so only reluctantly . And she is as good at mentioning the price of responding as she is at enhancing our ability to feel the evil . We have already taken up her contention that the passion to relieve economic misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia . We have also noticed her view that even when economic troubles are less acute and more amenable to solution , that very solution must be administrative . It can not be political in the double sense . Political action can not create wealth , only economic production or theft can ; and economic problems must be handled by experts , by having some people tell others what to do . Her political theory is not a theory of the beneficient uses that can be made of executive and administrative powers . It is clear , therefore , that her aversion to a unitary world state is an aversion to a world without true political action . There is a silent lamentation in her redescription of Kant 's utopia of world // peace : " But this ideal state would necessarily put an end to politics and political action as we know it today and whose follies and vanities are recorded by history.i26 One wants to say that for her this prospect is as dire as a nuclear holocaust . But one can not say that : Her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balancing the great gain of ridding the world of the nuclear peril and the great existential loss sustained by humanity living in an administered world . Freedom is not the conquest of necessity ; nor conquered from it . Freedom exists in spite of necessity , or in its absence . The large implication of this point is that when one considers another actual and future possible horror ? starvation because of " overpopulation " ? one must admit that Arendt 's adequacy as a political theorist of modernity comes under tremendous strain . Clearly it is not that she wants correctable suffering ignored . Rather , she does not want us to think that when governments engage in remedial , purposive activity we are seeing true political action . Remedial activity crowds out the right understanding of political action and , with it , the will to act in a truly political way . The prestige of administration subverts the idea of equal citizenship . In return , Arendt 's thought works to withdraw prestige from remedial , purposive activity . In short , her philosophy must lead her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her work demonstrates that in seeking generally to prevent a sense of the worst things from injuring the desire to posit and affirm the best things , and in seeking to deny that a solution for any of the worst things can be good in itself , she may leave some readers feeling that she has deserted them . Great in her understanding of totalitarianism , she seems to falter or fall silent ( say , about possible environmental catastrophes ) when other horrors press for consideration . There might be some consolation in remembering that she persistently maintains that acts of spontaneous political audacity can avert what appeared to be a fated horror , or can interrupt and even end an existent one . There may be further consolation in noticing how she turns on her beloved Greeks in her most " Greek " book , The Human Condition : The miracle that saves the world , the realm of human affairs , from its normal , " natural " ruin is ultimately the fact of natality , in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the new beginning .... Only the full experience of this capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope , those two essential characteristics of human existence which Greek antiquity ignored altogether . ' She goes on to find the summa of faith and hope in the words of Isaiah : " A child has been born unto us . " To what degree these tendencies in her thought can be used to enlist her in a more desperately purposive and hopeful sense of politics one can not say . It is probable that the effort should not be made . The limitations of her thought ? or the seeming limitations ? should instead be taken as a sign of what may be the truth . It may be that no body of thought could possibly possess the resources to contemplate all the worst things and still preserve a genuine idealism ? in any case , an idealism in which a distinctive sense of political action as the supreme existential opportunity presides . All idealism requires incompleteness . It is noteworthy in itself that the modern horror about which Arendt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very sphere of human activity where she finds what she affirms as the highest existential opportunity open to the generality of mankind . ( The life of thinking or of contemplation can be only for a few . ) That is , she does not go outside the public sphere to find salvation , even while she is prepared as well as any other philosopher to ponder its malignancy . Furthermore , her praise of political action can not be reduced to ? it can scarcely be related to ? the desire to see totalitarianism resisted by the concerted action of its enemies or intended victims . Politics is much more than resistance . One would expect a writer so determined to persevere in delineating pathology to be overcome by repugnance at the norm : as if to say , if something as bad as this can happen in the public sphere , let us turn away from it altogether . Let us merely endure it , if we can . Let us look to some other sphere . Let us seek consolation , not expecting joy . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mysticism convert the splendor of nature or the freedom of the will into devices for belittling human society , especially the public sphere ; of redefining that realm as trivial and delusive , as nothing in comparison to nature and psyche . Let us manage our impressions and think ourselves into self-sufficiency . Arendt refuses the temptation of Epictetus , the most natural temptation ? an achievement that may ease the way to feeling less disappointment concerning Arendt 's principled severance of political action from remedial , purposive activity.28 The Meaning of Alienation On the unmistakable horrors of modernity , then , Arendt 's political theory has much to offer , but some may feel that much is withheld . But , modernity is more than its horrors . Harsh complexity arises when we see that saying what a horror is may cause disagreement . The disagreement may be so acute that a phenomenon perceived as a horror by some may be thought either not so awful as a horror , or , indeed , may be thought a positive good , or at least a mixed good . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , which she calls , most generally , alienation . She finds in alienation not a specific horror , but a pervasive mentality that is often painful to endure and that is part of the direct or ultimate source of the specific horror of f ? totalitarianism , and the source and also the intensified outcome of smaller wrongs and evils . By seeing only the horror in alienation , and the horrors that may be connected to it , Arendt fails to deal properly with the heroism and greatness of modernity , which are at the source of alienation . Even more important , she takes little account of the benign effects and intimations of a moderate , everyday alienation , the kind of alienation that helps to define the self nurtured by modern constitutional representative democracy . This benign sort of alienation could not have come into existence unless the acute sort had also . Thus Arendt is at one with all those who lament alienation , even though her analysis contains some novel elements . It may be , however , that lamentation is not the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienation // inspires more than lamentation in the political theorist , the theory can not be fully adequate to the work of confronting modernity . By alienation Arendt means two things : first , world alienation , and second , earth alienation . Words like homelessness and decenteredness catch most of the content , as does the more common synonym , estrangement . She is trying to conceptualize the condition in which the rightly expectable is taken away or has always been felt as missing . Quite without elaboration , Arendt assumes this condition is in some of its manifestations painful and will , painful or not , necessarily issue in social and political aberrations , large and small . But aside from the pain and the consequences , alienation is to be lamented as the wrong condition to be in . The largely unargued premise is that the human race exists in order to be at home in the world and on the earth ; that our humanity is tied to the absence of alienation ? at least , the radical alienation in the modern age . She says in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposeless art objects , as well as the seemingly the purposeless variety of nature , have the " purpose " of pleasing men , making them feel at home in the world . This can never be proved ; but purposiveness is an idea by which to regulate one 's reflections in one 's reflective judgments.29 These sentiments may be religious in nature ; in fact , they may be an important component of religiousness by definition . Arendt rarely spoke of her own religious beliefs , but Alfred Kazin quotes her as saying , " I have never , since a child , doubted that God exists . " 30 She also shows a steadfast refusal to use the word religion in any extended sense as functionalist social scientists do : She insists on reserving it for the relationship to the nonhuman , the above-human.31 Let us just say that though she is adamantly untheological , Arendt seems to have a religious commitment to the notion that we exist to be at home in the world and on the earth , and that human identity depends on it . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that people are at home , or at home humanly ; only that the opportunity to work on the project of being at home is not hopelessly blocked . She speaks of alienation in connection with mankind or with large masses of people in their commonality when they live fully in modernity . ( She does not more precisely locate the bearers of alienation . ) Being at home in the world and on the earth , existentially or religiously right in itself for humanity , is also the precondition for an affiliated achievement : It enables individuals to feel reconciled to their lives . Reconciliation is genuine only when one has lived a life of achieved identity through memorable deeds , deeds fit to be made into stories . Groups of people must be at home in the world first if the frame of memorable deeds , the frame of political action , is to be secured and strengthened . Of course , even without this special kind of reconciliation , not being alienated matters greatly . Yet human capacities have produced world alienation and earth alienation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hope is that humanity could be at home rightly . The hope is dashed by modernity . The hope is dashed by the growth of human capacities to master and use nature . In the perspective of world alienation , the great series of events that comprise the European " discovery of the globe as a whole , " 32 and the // emergence of a global economy spurred by economic ambitions retrospectively called capitalist , are decisive . In the perspective of earth alienation , the splitting of the atom and the exploration of space are decisive . These two related sets define modern alienation . Because mankind is just beginning to explore space , and because the full possibilities of splitting the atom are not yet disclosed , we are in a better position to know the meaning of world alienation than of earth alienation . Nevertheless , Arendt says that world alienation is of " minor significance " in comparison to earth alienation.33 What is world alienation ? Arendt 's discussion suggests a dynamic , remorseless process of economic growth , accompanied until fairly recently by immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their place in the world and their naked exposure to the exigencies of life , created both the original accumulation of wealth and the possibility of transforming this wealth into capital through labor . These together constituted the conditions for the rise of a capitalist economy .... What distinguishes this development at the beginning of the modern age from similar occurrences in the past is that expropriation and wealth accumulation did not simply result in new property or lead to a new redistribution of wealth , but were fed back into the process to generate further expropriations , greater productivity , and more appropriation.34 The essence of the process in its earlier phases was the uprooting of many people from their land and their conversion into " free " laborers . At the same time , the very notion of property as rootedness and as an inviolable private place and shelter was transformed . " Society " replaced the family as " the subject of the new life process , " while national solidarity was supposed to make up for the weakening of family solidarity.35 The ultimate logic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the human race experiences the same experiences and is affected by the same happenings . We have seen that Arendt worried about the unitary world state as a proposed remedy for the problem of nuclear weapons . Abhorrence of a nearly undifferentiated global society in which all people exist , so to speak , in the same time and on the same plane is part of the worry . The fact is that Arendt defines the core of world alienation as , precisely , the loss of group differentiation , which is not only the loss of mediation between the individual self and everything else , but the loss of elements that help to compose a self and sanely enlist its energies . She says : " For men can not become citizens of the world as they are citizens of their countries , and social men can not own collectively as family and household men own their private property . " 36 The unchecked movement to a global society would consummate world alienation . To be in the world one must be in only a part of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distinct other parts . Individual identity depends on group life , which depends on group identity . Every identity , whether individual or collective , requires otherness , not for the sake of developing itself through opposition and awareness of contrast , but because it is real only when perceived and acknowledged by something outside itself and different from itself . The world as a whole is not a world for any person . " World " here means the common life of a group fixed in a place and
