For Currency Trader Randall Holland , the first working day of 1988 started last Monday with an urgent 2 a.m. phone call from Tokyo . Jolted out of bed , Holland , who works for Wall Street 's Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , listened groggily as an excited colleague in Japan reported that the U.S. dollar was moving in a sharp and startling new direction : upward . Skeptical of the currency 's mysterious strength , Holland gave orders to sell part of the firm 's dollar holdings , then went back to sleep . At 4 a.m. the phone jangled again . This time it was a London colleague calling to report that the dollar 's rally was gaining momentum . Holland , abandoning any hope of getting back to sleep , put on a robe and padded into his den , where his computer terminal graphically displayed the dollar 's takeoff . " Holy smoke , something is happening ! " the trader exclaimed before jumping into his clothes and hailing a cab for Wall Street . " They apparently mean business . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers of the world 's industrial countries  --  were launching a major surprise mission to rescue the dollar from its perilous slide . The Federal Reserve and other central bankers intervened by unleashing a flood of orders to trade Japanese yen , West German marks and other denominations for the dollar . The strategy worked stunningly , sending traders scrambling to move in the same direction . Said Holland : " You do n't make money by challenging the Fed . You could get squished trying to do that . " <P> The dollar , after opening in Tokyo Monday at a post-World War II low of 120.45 yen , rocketed to 129.45 by Thursday in New York . Against the West German currency , the greenback jumped from a record low of 1.56 marks on Monday to a week 's high of 1.65 . But no one could say whether the dollar 's comeback could endure . The fragile currency backslid somewhat against the yen and mark on Friday in reaction to estimates that the U.S. budget deficit would balloon once again in fiscal 1989 . <P> The concerted central-bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decline in the dollar that was deliberately set in motion in September 1985 by the major industrial democracies . Since then , the dollar 's 50% drop against the yen and the mark has made American goods cheaper  --  and thus more competitive  --  in world markets . But by last February the industrial countries proclaimed that the dollar 's fall had reached a point of diminishing returns . The governments of Japan and West Germany , among others , began intervening in the market to cushion the sliding American currency . The U.S. , however , was reluctant to intervene wholeheartedly because it wanted to reduce the stubbornly large trade deficit . <P> The dollar continued to slip even though foreign governments spent almost + $100 billion during 1987 to prop up the currency . By late December the dollar went into a nose dive . Unbeknown to most traders , though , the central bankers were quietly baiting a so-called bear trap , in which they aimed to punish speculators who had been reaping profits by consistently betting on the dollar 's downfall . They secretly agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , possibly at 120 yen . At first only the Bank of Japan came to the rescue . Then all at once last Monday , moneymen from central banks around the world  --  including the Federal Reserve  --  got on the phones to place buy orders .
