NEW YORK  --  Commodore International Ltd. announced two plant closings and associated write-downs that may result in a loss for the second quarter ended Dec. 31 , retreating from a profit projection the company made a few days ago . The maker of personal computers wouldn ' t estimate the size of the possible loss or the amount of the write-downs from closing a semiconductor plant in Costa Mesa , Calif. , and a computer assembly plant in Corby , England . But a spokesman said the write-downs would be " far less " than the $63 million inventory write-down the company took in its fiscal 1985 fourth quarter . Commodore said it will dismiss 200 workers at the California plant and 250 at the facility in England , reducing its work force about 13% to between 3 , 000 and 3 , 500  --  down from 4 , 500 six months ago . The West Chester , Pa. - based company said the write-downs would include severance pay and other costs of those layoffs . On Monday , Thomas J. Rattigan , Commodore ' s president , repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small profit for the second quarter as it attempts to rebound from three quarters of losses totaling $184 million . Yesterday , however , a company spokesman said , " We ' ll have to clarify that ; that will be pre-tax operating profit . " The company is expected to report that second-quarter revenue was roughly even with the year-earlier level . For the year-earlier quarter , Commodore earned $3. 2 million , or 10 cents a share , on sales of $338. 7 million . Charles Wolf , an analyst with First Boston Corp. , said the plant closings are " precisely what they should be doing . It ' s a positive thing . " In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Commodore closed at $10 a share , down 75 cents . Commodore ' s banks have set a deadline of Jan. 31 for renegotiating loans on which Commodore has been in technical default since the middle of last year . As of Sept. 30 , Commodore ' s total bank debt was $192 million . " The only way the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives , " First Boston ' s Mr. Wolf said . " And the only way they ' re going to survive is if they cut back their plants and become a smaller company . " Mr. Wolf said he doesn ' t think the company is asking the banks for more money , but rather is seeking an extension of the loans . The company spokesman said the write-downs wouldn ' t hurt Commodore ' s cash flow significantly . Mr. Wolf and the Commodore spokesman said they currently don ' t consider a bankruptcy-law filing a possibility for the computer maker . The company spokesman said , " We don ' t foresee ( a bankruptcy-law filing ) at present , and we expect to reach agreements with the banks . " Although Commodore has reported healthy sales of its low-priced 64 and 128 models , sales of the new Amiga , viewed as crucial to the company ' s future , have been at the low end of company expectations . Because of a lack of software , the Amiga ' s highly praised sound and graphics capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can best afford the machine ' s $1 , 500 to $2 , 000 price tag . Commodore said it would move some semiconductor production from the California plant , which made custom chips for Commodore machines but not for resale , to the company ' s remaining chip factory in Norristown , Pa . Marshall F. Smith , chief executive officer , said the consolidation would " substantially reduce our overhead " while keeping the capability to hasten new products . The company still has several assembly plants , including facilities in the U.S. , West Germany , Hong Kong and Japan . The plant closings will occur over the next two to four weeks .
