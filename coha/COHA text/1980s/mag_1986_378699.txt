Standing amid the lush bamboo groves and rice paddies of northwestern Sichuan province , the U-shaped farmhouse is typical of the local architecture , with a wooden frame , stucco walls and a gray tile roof . Ten families have subdivided the 16 rooms of the 100-year-old structure into 32 cubicles , and its courtyard is dotted with drying pepper bunches and ears of corn . In the center of these crowded communal quarters stand three rooms unused except by the 60 or so visitors who turn up daily to see the birthplace of Deng Xiaoping . But even the smattering of photographs and old furniture on display in the farmhouse 's " cultural center " constitutes more of a memorial than China 's leader would like . When asked how he wanted his ancestral home in Paifang used , Deng replied , " Just keep it as it was , and let the peasants live there . " <P> To say that Deng does not relish self-promotion is an understatement . He has never held any of the official titles usually associated with national leadership . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I told them I was too old for that , " Deng recently told a TIME-sponsored Newstour . " Then people wanted me to take the post of President , and I said no , I would n't do that . " The Chinese press refers to him simply as " paramount leader . " But that modesty is hardly for lack of a life that has been interesting , both in the usual sense of the word or in that of the old curse ( " May you live in interesting times " ) . <P> Deng 's long career has been a biographer 's dream , a tumultuous charge through war and revolution , exhilarating political triumphs and equally humiliating downfalls , personal achievements and family tragedies . Through it all , drawing on seemingly limitless reserves of energy and wily resilience , the tenacious 4-ft. 11-in. politician has managed not only to endure but to prevail . Today , one year into his ninth decade , he stands at the zenith of his power as leader of the world 's most populous nation and as progenitor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Deng 's sweeping vision for China is all the more remarkable for his lack of intellectual pretense . Unlike the late Mao Tse-tung , his mentor and eventual nemesis , Deng has never claimed to be either a scholar or a Marxist theoretician . Nor does he possess the studied mandarin sophistication of the late Premier Chou En-lai , another longtime comrade-in-arms . Not that Deng lacks for a keen intelligence or a world view . But what he has consistently sought to impose is a preference for gradual rather than sudden change and for pragmatism over doctrine . In discussing China 's second revolution recently , Deng said , " If it could enable people to improve their lives gradually , then I think the policy itself is a sure guarantee of its continuity .
