This city does n't look as if it 's in the midst of a fullfledged economic crisis . To the visitor it seems like a suburb of Miami . Restaurants are crowded , traffic clogs the streets , and the stores are full of imported luxuries . To see the Venezuelan crisis you have to go to the port of La Guaira . Seven months ago , the horizon was dotted with ships waiting for berth space to unload , and Venezuela was importing $13 billion worth of goods annually . Today there is dock space going begging . But the cantinas where dockworkers gather are crowded with thousands of stevedores idled by a 60 percent drop in cargoes . During the decade of the auge petrolera ( petroleum deluge ) , Venezuelans came to believe in the miracle of sudden wealth . Now , as a popular story has it , they think windfall oil profits are merely good luck ; a miracle is finding someone capable of managing them . Still , there is all that oil in the ground  --  fuel for dreams . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund will bail Venezuela out with a minimum of conditions , perhaps , or that the new president , who will be chosen December 4 , will come up with a magic formula for solving the country 's problems . Or maybe , contrary to all projections , oil prices will rise again and the deluge will return . President Luis Herrera Campins has contributed to the deceptive calm in Caracas by doing nothing about the economic crisis , but the pain is now spreading throughout the general populace . Twenty percent of the work force is unemployed ( an independent survey showed that thirty-one large firms had laid off anywhere from 17 percent to 50 percent of their employees in the past year ) . Most of those who lost their jobs received severance pay under the Law of Unjustified Dismissals , a populist measure put through by former President Carlos Andres Perez in 1974 , but the money wo n't last forever - , Imports , upon which the Venezuelan economy is heavily dependent , have plummeted  --  everything from pharmaceuticals to tractor parts . The national unit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of 4.3 to the dollar for twenty years , fell to 17 to the dollar in the open market in February ( it is now 9.95 to the dollar ) , and only drastic price controls have kept inflation from tripling That has made goods from abroad prohibitively expensive , and suppliers demand payment in advance  --  in dollars . Once the land of the megaproject , Venezuela now has J.E . Murray is the pseudonym of a journalist who works for a weekly business publication on Latin America . 8,000 unemployed engineers . Plans for new bridges , dams , roads  --  even whole communities  --  that were hatched in more prosperous times have been canceled . An $8 billion crude-oil refinery complex in the Orinoco Basin , which would have been developed with the participation of several U.S. firms , including Bechtel and C.E. Lummus , has been put on ice . Even before the current crisis , multinational corporations Were reluctant to open plants in Venezuela . For one thing , the country 's population is too small  --  only 15.6 million  --  to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andean Pact , which restricts the amount of profits multinationals may take out of the country , prohibits them from investing in certain economic sectors ( for example , television and newspapers ) and requires foreign investors to " fade down " their ownership of new enterprises over a period of time so that local investors will end up owning a majority of the stock . Finally , since wages are higher in Venezuela than in most Third World countries and almost all parts used in manufacturing must be imported , goods produced here can not be sold on world markets at competitive prices . Many of the foreign companies that have plants here have developed contingency plans for pulling out . Thousands of local manufacturers , crushed by high dollar debts , rising costs and fixed prices , are on the verge of bankruptcy . Politicians of the two major parties , AcciOn Democratica ( A.D. ) and Copei , have been profiting , however . Since 1976 , when the state took control of more than 60 percent of the economy , politics has been the royal road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have an interest , wangle low-interest loans and accept bribes . A recently published congressional committee report exposed extensive bipartisan corruption among the union and party bureaucrats who ran the Banco de los Trabajadores . The bank , in which unions owned a 57 percent share , was the nation 's third largest financial institution until the government forced it to cease operations early this year . There are some honest men in Venezuelan politics . All the candidates for president are free of the taint of scandal . They are also innocent of ideas about how to run the economy . In other countries the political spectrum spans the right , the center and the left ; in Venezuela it embraces the ' red ( Rafael Caldera of the Copei ) , the pedestrian ( Jaime Lusinchi of the A.D. ) and the undistinguished ( Teodoro Petkoff of the leftish Movimiento al Socialismo ) . The four other candidates , from much smaller parties , fall into the " pedestrian " category . In the early polls Lusinchi was far ahead , reflecting the public 's lack of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollsters ' predictions of an A.D. landslide failed to take into account the deep divisions within the party . Lusinchi won the nomination after an intraparty battle with followers of Carlos Andres Perez , President from 1974 to 1978 . But Perez  --  popularly known as " Cap " ? remains a powerful political figure . He still has allies within the party , many of whom he appointed to public office . Yet many Venezuelans believe that his policies caused the economic crisis . The divisions within the A.D. are evident in the differences in the views of its most prominent figures . They range from social democrat Luis Matos Azocar , a new face in the party , who preaches the old-time religion of increased government intervention in the economy , to Perezistas like Carmelo Lauria and Hector Hurtado , who call for reduced intervention and who seem to echo Fedecamaras , a lobbying group which represents privately owned businesses . Intraparty disputes have weakened the A.D. 's campaign organization , and Lusinchi 's early twenty-point lead has been cut in half . Fearing that the conflict between Lusinchi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls , A.D. publicists came up with a poster showing Lusinchi and Cap with their arms around each other . One disillusioned A.D. member calls it the " Jaime : ' Et tu ? ' " poster , referring to the party 's slogan " Jaime es como tu " ( " Jaime is like you " ) . As the A.D. campaign faltered , Copei candidate Rafael Caldera gained strength . At 69 , he is a patriarchal figure in the party , and he has used his prestige to heal rifts among his followers . Caldera , who served as President from 1969 to 1973 , is attempting the difficult feat of distancing himself from Herrera without attacking the party . The Copei 's problems are more generational than philosophical : there is no room for young people at the top level of party leadership . Neither Lusinchi nor Caldera has much background in economics , and both refuse to provide specifics about the policies they would pursue if elected . They also avoid discussing Venezuela 's future . The most either will promise is to be " less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign has degenerated into a referendum on who is responsible for the present economic mess . If Venezuelans decide to blame the A.D. , Lusinchi will lose ; if they decide to blame the incumbents , Caldera will lose . But in either case the teal losers will , as usual , be the majority of Venezuelans . It is easier to understand Venezuela 's economic dilemma than it is to apportion blame for it . In 1973 , petroleum prices tripled . Three years later the government nationalized the oil industry and drew up a plan for development based on the export of petroleum , steel , iron and aluminum . As has happened in several other petroleum-exporting countries ( notably Indonesia , Iran , Nigeria and Mexico ) , the rapid expansion of the economy created grandiose expectations , and the government launched a series of projects without having the money to pay for them . When the funds ran out , foreign banks were eager to lend the government money  --  sometimes on disadvantageous terms . Forty percent of Venezuela 's debts are short term , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high interest rates and with oil selling at rock-bottom prices , Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso , one of the founders of OPEC , looks like a prophet . In 1976 , before oil prices collapsed , he told an 4merican political scientist , Terry Karl , " I call petroleum ' the devil 's excrement . ' It brings trouble . Look around you . Look at this locura  --  waste , corruption , consumption , our public services falling apart . . . . And debt , debt we shall have for years . . . . This boom has n't brought us any benefits . None . This money has not made us better Venezuelans . The conditions of our lives are no better . We are drowning in the devil 's excrement " * Venezuela , like most oil-exporting countries , made the mistake of investing in capital-intensive and vertically integrated industries ( e.g. , refining and petrochemicals ) , and placed too much emphasis on increasing its exports . Its economic planners stressed industrial growth instead of income redistribution , industrial diversification and agricultural self-sufficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . ) An economy based on the export of oil requires a highly skilled work force paid at internationally competitive rates . The oil industry , whose local labor force is very small ( only 1 percent of all Venezuelan workers ) , has become a separate enclave , contributing little to the rest of the economy The oil boom created two Venezuelas : one is rich and dependent on the state . the other is poor and dependent on the rich and the state The distance between these two worlds is as wide as the Orinoco River . Venezuelan intellectuals are isolated from the rest of the population , and produce less scholarship , less fiction and less art about the country 's poor , its working class , conomy than those of any other country in Latin Amerka The most important book on Venezuelan industry , El Desafio Industrial de Venezuela , was written by two Chileans , Sergio Bitar and Eduardo Troncoso . This much is known about the Venezuelan masses : 37 percent of the population live below the official poverty line , 42 percent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of households , 9.5 percent of all Venezuelans under the age of 15 suffer from malnutrition , and gross domestic production per capita has declined more than 20 percent since 1978 . Half the population have always been poor , but they are relatively poorer now than they were before the oil boom . The " other " Venezuela has no strong defenders in the political arena . The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers is compromised by its ties to the A.D. and hampered by its lack of militancy . The unions ' power is limited by a collective bargaining system that discourages industrywide strikes and a dues-collection system that makes long strikes almost impossible . They have also been chastened by high unemployment . Contract settlements this year have been a plutocrat 's picnic : three-year contracts containing moderate wage increases and productivity clauses have been the rule . As one labor consultant put it , " Venezuelan producers have a lot of things to worry about . But class struggle is n't one of them . Yet . " No one sees an alternative to the two major parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 percent of the vote on December 4 . But there is widespread fear that violent protests over unemployment and inflation will break out in the coming months ( prices are expected to rise 20 percent this year , 30 percent next year ) . " There will be trouble , " a Caracas-based foreign journalist predicted . " Strikes , price riots . Nothing major . But alarms . The whole system is a time bomb . " Among the things that worry the business community is the rescheduling of Venezuela 's $33 billion foreign debt . Fractious discussions between the government and the banks ' steering committee have been going on since March . The government has called in Dr. I.M.F. , but its proposed . cure for Venezuela 's financial ills is tough medicine : adopting a unified exchange rate , including the private sector 's $8 billion foreign debt in the restructuring , lifting price controls , imposing restraints on wage increases , repealing import controls and reducing state participation in the economy This bitter pill would ease some executive headaches , but the business community is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , " said an auto parts manufacturer . " The question is , How much will workers give up before they rebel ? How long will the engineers , technicians a , , , - . doctors stay before they emigrate ? " " It was bad timing , " a lawyer said . " I feel like we got caught : the interest rates , the world recession . If we 'd just had more time " The boom in Venezuela , unlike the silver boom , the rubber boom , the guano boom and all the others , was supposed to last forever . Venezuela would beat the development clock . Other countries got caught  --  population outraced national wealth , or technology outraced nature , or expectations outraced performance , or social weaknesses outraced institutional strengths . But Venezuelans believed that money would buy time and that they would be able to solve all their problems . Venezuela 's tragedy is that its pell-mell rush to development has made it more , not less , dependent on foreign capital . It used to wait for decisions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; today it waits for decisions to be made in the offices of the bankers . Time was not for sale Cl
