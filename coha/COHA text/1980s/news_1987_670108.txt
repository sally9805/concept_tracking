NEW YORK  --  When Brazil ' s finance minister and central bank governor sit down with Citicorp and the country ' s other major commercial bank creditors next week , they will be negotiating more than just Brazilian debt . Brazil , the developing world ' s biggest debtor with $108 billion owed to international creditors , is increasingly seen as a test case for other negotiations between banks and debt-strapped nations , such as the Philippines and Argentina . Brazil has been pressured into reopening debt talks by falling reserves and a disappointing balance-of-payments deficit , projected at $2. 8 billion for 1986 . Discussing the coming negotiations , commercial bank negotiators said they want to ensure that the unprecedented debt concessions they made last year with Mexico aren ' t given to Brazil and other debtor countries . But they acknowledged that Brazil will try to match Mexico ' s terms . Some observers said the banks are on weak ground . " I think the moment the banks accepted the terms of the Mexican agreement , they let themselves into a situation where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa Rica , " said Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski , a director of First Boston Corp. and a Latin America expert . " I think the Brazilians would be silly to hold out for anything less than the Mexicans got , " he added . Alan Stoga of Kissinger Associates , a consulting firm , said : " Major concessions tend to generalize to one extent or another . " Venezuela also is trying to get easier terms in the wake of the Mexican package . Its finance minister , Manuel Azpurua , is in New York this week seeking from his country ' s main bank creditors a reduction of debt interest margin , no debt principal repayments in 1987 and a debt repayment schedule linked to the price of oil , a source close to the talks said . The Philippines meanwhile has postponed its debt talks until next month , partly to see what happens in the forthcoming Brazilian talks , bankers say . Bank negotiators , who declined to be identified , said the Mexican agreement was worked out between Mexico and U.S. government and multinational institutions in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This won ' t happen with negotiations about Brazil ' s debt , they said . Indeed Brazil , unlike Mexico , still declines to negotiate an economic austerity program with the International Monetary Fund . The terms Mexico achieved are the best yet for a major Third World debtor country . Under the agreement negotiated last fall , commercial bank creditors agreed to lend Mexico $6 billion in new money , half of which will be guaranteed by the World Bank . These loans are due over 12 years at an annual interest rate of 13/16 percentage point above the rate banks charge one another for funds in London . Bank creditors also rescheduled about $44 billion of Mexican government debt over 20 years at an annual rate of 13/16 point above the London rate , with only interest payments due in the first seven years . Banks also pledged to provide an additional $1. 2 billion in so-called investment contingency funds , which will be dispersed when the IMF thinks Mexico needs funds . The banks will lend a further $500 million , half guaranteed by the World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 3% and 4% this year . In the past few years , Brazil has experienced much more buoyant growth than Mexico , and bank negotiators will likely argue that it doesn ' t need the more-lenient terms given to Mexico . But Brazil has recently experienced surging consumer demand that has narrowed its wide trade surplus , and increased prices and interest rates have partly undone the success of last year ' s so-called Cruzado anti-inflation plan . Big price and tax increases in late November caused rioting , and the country ' s reserves are estimated to have sagged recently to between $4 billion and $5 billion . Meanwhile , the Brazilian central bank ' s present projection of a $2. 8 billion 1986 balance-of-payments deficit compares with forecasts in early 1986 for an annual surplus of more than $1 billion . That , in turn , compares with a 1985 payments surplus of $14 million . The balance of payments represents all flows of funds , including debt repayments and trade , into and out of a country . Even the present payments-deficit projection is too optimistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in November and $871 million in December . The November surplus actually totaled $131 million . The December figure , according to a central bank official quoted in the Brazilian press , totaled about $100 million . That could push the 1986 payments deficit to about $3. 5 billion . Because of these recent poor trade figures , Brazil ' s 1986 trade surplus could drop to about $9. 5 billion , economists say , in contrast to a recent central bank estimate of $10. 5 billion . Even that is a considerable drop from its projection in early 1986 of a $12. 5 billion trade surplus , the same as the actual surplus in 1985 . Such recent difficulties have increased Brazil ' s need for new money . No one knows yet how much new money Dilson Funaro , the finance minister , and Fernao Bracher , the central bank governor , will seek from the commercial bankers next week , but it is likely to be several billion dollars . A central bank spokesman confirmed that Mr. Bracher will seek new money but said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Table Third World Debtors ( In Billions of Dollars ) Brazil. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $108. 0 Mexico . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100. 3 South Korea . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51. 6 Argentina. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49. 8 Indonesia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42. 7 India . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39. 7 Egypt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36. 8 Venezuela . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35. 3 Turkey . . . . . . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 30. 3 Source : Morgan Guaranty Trust Co . <> Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
