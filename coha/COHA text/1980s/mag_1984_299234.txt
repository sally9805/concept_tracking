JAMES AGEE : A LIFE by Laurence Bergreen Dutton ; 467 pages ; $20 <P> One May night in Tennessee , when James Rums Agee was six years old , his father drove off the Clinton Pike . One wheel of his Ford was still spinning in the air when the first witness arrived . Jay Agee lay face down about a foot from the car , his clothes scarcely mussed . The only sign of violence was a small cut on the chin . <P> James Agee spent the rest of his life trying to understand his father 's absurd end , spinning his own wheels as he hurtled to an early death . But what Laurence Bergreen 's solid , unassuming biography makes clear is how much Agee managed to accomplish during that ride . While he was drinking himself to the edge of alcoholism , while he was compulsively womanizing , while he was further wasting himself by lamenting this waste in allnight soliloquies , Agee was also producing . <P> From his days as critic for TIME and the Nation in the 1940s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film reviews that helped establish the standards for the art . He wrote two moving and complex novels . He composed at least five screenplays , including that shaggy Bogart-Hepburn classic , The African Queen . He turned out reams of verse , published and unpublished , and won the prestigious Yale Younger Poets award . <P> During his first stint for Time Inc. , as a writer for FORTUNE , Agee was assigned a story that let him weld his overheated rhetoric to a social theme : the lives of ' 30s sharecroppers in the South , with photographs by Walker Evans . Agee later appraised his own work as " a sinful book at least in all degrees of ' falling short of the mark . ' " The critical and popular response reflected his view : published as a book in 1941 , Let Us Now Praise Famous Men had sold only 600 copies by the end of the year . But Agee 's collaboration with Evans refused to die . The years seemed to diminish the **25;10100;TOOLONG discursions , adolescent stridence-and to ratify Critic Lionel Trilling 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our generation . " <P> Along the way , the " captive poet , " as his editor at TIME called him , wrote hundreds of letters-to Father James Harold Flye , his high-church Episcopal mentor at St. Andrew 's School in Tennessee , who remained his confidant from the time Agee was ten , to old classmates at Phillips Exeter and Harvard , to his three wives and countless lovers , to all the women who satisfied what he confessed was a " run-to-Mama " complex .
