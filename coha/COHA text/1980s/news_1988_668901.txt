William Porter " Billy " Payne Esq. , was sitting in church last year when the vision came to him . Payne , an Atlanta lawyer , had just finished a successful fund-raising drive for the church and was looking for guidance on what goodwill project he should attack next . Suddenly it hit him : Why not bring the Olympic Games to Atlanta ? Now , a lot of people have been dreaming of the five Olympic rings since they turned out to be worth $225 million in profits at the 1984 Los Angeles Games . Such visions are rarely clouded by realities . So it didn ' t bother Payne that Atlanta had almost studiously avoided any connection with Olympic sports since 1980 . And it hardly even occurred to him that , after waiting 52 years to let the Summer Games come back to the United States , the International Olympic Committee was unlikely to approve another U.S. city 12 years after Los Angeles . William Porter " Hi , I ' m Billy " Payne , co-captain of Georgia ' s 1968 football team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movers and shakers and then went to see the mayor , Andrew Young , whose first reaction was to pass off Payne as a good ol ' boy with a goofy idea . But that changed . The temptation is to think similarly of Atlanta as an Olympic host , but that is no longer possible , either . Not after the U.S. Olympic Committee executive board chose Atlanta over Minneapolis-St . Paul as the 1996 U.S. bid city by a 65-42 vote two weeks ago in Washington . Not with the mayor of Athens , the sentimental but no longer logical choice for 1996 , saying the financially strapped city should not spend the $1 billion it would cost to stage the Games . And not with the mayor of Atlanta becoming a major player in the process . Once Young was convinced Payne could back his dream with action , the mayor became the front man for Atlanta ' s bid . With gusto . " It ' s like throwing Br ' er Rabbit back into the briar patch , " Young said of the role he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . Young is absolutely Atlanta ' s greatest asset . No U.S. city has a mayor with international connections like those Young forged as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Carter presidency . In an instant , he will be able to open doors it took Anchorage officials years to crack in their Winter Olympic bids . " I figure I ' m a politician , and this is international politics , so I look forward to it with great relish , " Young said . " I ' m willing to be as important as I can be in bringing the Games to Atlanta . " At its lavish party in a Washington mansion the night before the USOC vote , Young was official greeter . Among the guests were four ambassadors from black African nations . " The potent international capability of our mayor makes us a formidable candidate , " Payne said . The city ' s other big pluses are the economic problems in Athens ; Coca- Cola ( headquartered in Atlanta ) , which is one of the IOC ' s biggest sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Turner ' s connections with the Soviet Union as a result of the Turner-sponsored Goodwill Games , which will take place again in Seattle less than two months before the 1990 IOC vote for the 1996 host city . Atlanta will likely be competing with Athens , host city when the modern Olympics began in 1896 ; Belgrade , Yugoslavia ; Frankfurt , West Germany ; a British city and an Australian city ; and Toronto . If Athens is , indeed , not a viable candidate , Toronto is considered the favorite because it is North America ( which brings higher TV rights fees ) but not the U.S. again . " In international sports , strange things can happen , " said USOC President Robert Helmick . With Toronto in the fight and Puerto Rico looking for the Games in 2004 ( and , therefore , hoping they stay out of the Americas until then ) , Atlanta can not even count on support from its own hemisphere . But Young had an answer ready for that seeming liability . " I ' ve been accused of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe this isn ' t my hemisphere . " Young has had several African students live in his home . One of them , Alphonse Swai of Tanzania , suggested in 1984 that African athletes could use a place to acclimate before the Games in Los Angeles . With the help of the U.S. Information Agency , Young arranged for athletes from 21 nations to have a training camp in Atlanta . He has also enlisted one of this country ' s most internationally esteemed athletes , Edwin Moses , to lobby for Atlanta . Moses , who went to school at Atlanta ' s Morehouse College , said he will take an active part after trying for a third Olympic gold medal in September . " Edwin has made a science of getting over hurdles , " Young said . " Once he starts coaching me to get over political hurdles , we ' ve got it made . " Young ' s term as mayor expires at the end of 1990 . He has pledged to continue his Olympic efforts if Atlanta loses in 1996 but keeps bidding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries about being confused with another U.S. bid city , Atlanta will not begin zealously wooing IOC members until after the 1994 Winter Olympics are awarded Sept. 15 . After that , Atlanta will spend between $5 million and $10 million in the bidding process alone . Payne said $250 , 000 in private donations was spent during the 15-month bid process to be U.S. bid city . Some within the USOC , who thought it was wasteful to have a U.S. bid city designated for 1996 , argued that the money could be better spent on support for U.S. athletes or for staging major national or international events in Olympic sports . Payne and Young insisted that from now on , Atlanta will try to have a significant presence as host for such events . " I think it is pure greed to think the U.S. should get the Games so soon , " said Mike Jacki , executive director of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation . " I have had no expression from any member of the international community that it is greedy or presumptuous for us to bid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , including German Rieckehoff of Puerto Rico ( who has his own agenda , of course ) , express strong feelings that Athens should have the centennial Games . For that , Atlanta has a perfect response : it will have events in Athens . . . Georgia , where the University of Georgia is located . " I thought that was the Athens they meant all along , " said Billy Payne , with a Georgian ' s vision of the world . CAPTION : PHOTO : UPI Photo .
