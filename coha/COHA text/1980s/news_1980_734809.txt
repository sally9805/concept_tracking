txt NEW YORK  --  For better or worse , I drink tea all day long . Since I have no interest in tea bags ? contrivances that are mass-produced for some common denominator in taste ? . I brew my own , blending a combination of teas from China and India or Ceylon . Anyone who has grown up with tea bags will think of home-blending as precious or arcane ; but it is neither . I simply mix one-part black tea ( pekoe ) , which is strong and rich , with one part green ( young hyson ) , which is weaker and , more bitter . The leaves are placed in the bottom of a kettle , boiling water is poured over them , and then the brew is allowed to steep a few minutes . Using a two-cup kettle , I pour off one cup of tea , drink it hot at once and add another cup ' of boiling water .

There have been some refinements in tea-making devices in recent years that I admire , although I have n't yet been persuaded to change over to them . One is the tea ball , a perforated vessel about the shape and size of an egg . It is filled with the desired blend and submerged in the kettle , dangling . from a chain . Of course , when the dripping ball is removed , one does n't know what to do'with it , which is why I truly like only one of the ball designs ? it comes with its own cup-shaped stand .
