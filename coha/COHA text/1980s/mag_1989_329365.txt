With its turbocharged engine and curvilinear profile , the Swedish-built Saab 900 was a chariot of choice for arrivistes of the mid-1980s . But now Saab- Scania 's auto division is hitting the skids , largely because of intensified competition and a relatively weak dollar that has pushed the cost of Saab 's newest 9000 turbo model to a base price of $30,795 . The parent company confirmed rumors last week that it is discussing a possible linkup with Ford , which could give the Swedish company 's finances a boost . The U.S. automaker is believed to be particularly interested in ventures with the Swedish company 's very profitable truck division . <P> In another sign of red-hot rivalry in the U.S. market , General Motors ' Oldsmobile division said last week that it would adopt a novel guarantee : Oldsmobile will allow buyers of its new cars who are dissatisfied for any reason to return the autos within 30 days ( or 1,500 miles ) for full credit on a different Olds .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
