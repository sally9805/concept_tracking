 | PART I : Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Cansi-no on October 17 , 1918 , in New York City . Her parents , vaudeville performers , were living in a theatrical hotel at the time . Volga Haworth , her mother , had come from a well-to-do family but had run away from home to seek a stage career . Eduardo Cansino was 21 when he first saw Volga appearing in the Ziegfeld Follies . Eduardo and his sister , Elisa , were the most popular dancing team of the day . The Cansino family , originally from Seville , Spain , @#  | were well bred , with an impressive lineage that dated back hundreds of years . Eduardo 's father had a world-famous dancing school in Madrid . The story that would later arise , that Rita Hayworth was a poor girl from a " deprived " family , was totally incorrect . When Eduardo had proposed marriage to Volga , he 'd stressed in no uncertain terms that his wife could not be an actress . Volga complied , but she resented the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alize . She compensated by dominating the household ? and by taking a drink or two to relieve the tension . Volga gave birth to Eduardo , Jr . only 18 months after Margarita . The Cansinos then bought a house in Jackson Heights , Queens , just outside Manhattan . But Volga 's moods of depression intensified after the arrival of her third child , another son , Vernon , three years later . Increasingly she took refuge in alcohol . During the I920s several of Eduardo 's brothers came to America and joined the family 's vaudeville act , now known as " The Dancing Cansinos . " And Margarita , a cute , pudgy child , began taking dancing lessons when she was only four . At seven , she was added to the act . The little girl darted out to perform a few steps and play the castanets . Although she never questioned her family 's love for her , Margarita realized at an early age that their expectations of her professionalism were high , and her intense desire to please them took precedence over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **31;527;TOOLONG child : quiet , reserved , totally obedient to her father 's wishes . In 1926 Eduardo and his sister were asked to dance in one of the first soundfilm musicals . Within a year the Cansinos had moved to Hollywood , where Eduardo opened a dance studio . Throughout the late 1920s Eduardo worked with top stars , choreographing numbers for their movies . Young Margarita took lessons with them . In October 1929 all the family investments were lost in the disastrous Crash . Business at the dance studio plummeted . To supplement his income , Eduardo began choreographing stage shows . Then , one night in the spring of 1931 , Margarita was a last-minute substitute when the regular dancer fell ill . Her performance was a revelation to her father . For the first time he saw her as a young woman and a professional . Eduardo decided he would start a new dance team ? this time with his own daughter . He was 36 , Margarita was n't even 14 . Eduardo tried to book the new act into the top Los Angeles nightclubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such rules did not apply in Mexico , where the " in " getaway spot among the movie crowd was Agua Caliente , near Tijuana . The Cansinos got their first booking at the Foreign Club Cafe de Luxe in Tijuana . By now Margarita had developed into a young woman , and both her mother and her father noticed how men backstage ? and out front ? eyed her . After each show Volga and Eduardo went out but ordered their daughter to stay in the dressing room . As usual , Margarita did as she was told ? but she began to resent her father . It was when Eduardo and Margarita were booked at Agua Caliente that Margarita was noticed by important film people , who assumed she was Mexican . At 15 she certainly looked Mexican ? her brown hair was dyed coal-black and worn combed straight back into a bun . During this time Margarita appeared as an extra in a few films shot in Tijuana and in Hollywood . The dream of Margarita Cansino , movie star , began to form in Eduardo 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheehan , a Fox Studios executive , asked to meet Margarita . When she came to his table , she was painfully shy . Eduardo did all the talking ? and Sheehan arranged for the girl to go to Hollywood for a screen test . The test turned out well . The young ster had high cheekbones , a strong jawline , beautiful skin . Sheehan ordered that her Latin look be retained by using heavy makeup . Margarita was signed to a standard theatrical contract , renewable every six months . The contract had to be signed by her father , since she was still a minor .  | Sheehan ordered voice lessons and acting lessons for his protege . From Margarita 's point of view , possibly the best news was that she would be out from under her father 's thumb at last . The girl 's ambition was focused , and she worked hard : She would become a fine actress as well as a dancer . She had gone on a stringent diet , which bore spectacular results . She posed for endless publicity photographs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Margarita Cansino was too long a name for marquees , and he shortened it to Rita Cansino . The 16 year old was now assigned to her first role , in a Spencer Tracy movie , Dante 's Inferno . Rita performed a dancing sequence . She was thrilled ? despite suffering an attack of nerves ? when assigned to her first real acting role in Under the Pampas Moon . In her one short scene it was evident that she had made an important new friend : the camera . Sheehan was now thinking of remaking Ramona , the big silent-film hit , and felt it would make Rita Cansino a star . But other studio executives did n't agree . To mollify them , Sheehan proposed that Rita make screen tests for Ramona . This placed the girl , who was always overanxious to please , under a lot of pressure . She worked feverishly to memorize the script . Rita now experienced a traumatic @# event . Production chief Darryl Zanuck had recently taken over as head of the newly merged Twentieth Century-Fox and was making moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Winfield Sheehan . Zanuck saw the screen tests of Rita and said no . When Rita was told the news , she was devastated . At 17 her life was suddenly falling apart , after so many years of hard work . A few days later she received a phone call from one of Zanuck 's aides telling her she need n't bother to return to the studio at all ? her option had been dropped . Yet her courage did n't desert her . She vowed she 'd make " them " regret their decision . The most mysterious man in Rita 's life now entered the scene . He has been described as an oil man , a businessman , a wealthy playboy , a gambler , a salesman . He was , in short , a promoter . Whatever he was ? or was n't ? Edward Judson had convinced many in Hollywood that he was influential . Sources indicate that Judson most likely met Eduardo Cansino and convinced him that he could do a great deal for Rita 's career . Judson did not make much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cansino met with Judson , who was outgoing , charming ? with the kind of driving personality needed to advance a young actress 's career . He convinced Eduardo that he knew many people in the film business and that he could see to it that Rita met them all . Judson was not disappointed when he met Rita , although he was surprised at how shy she was . She seemed to have no " personality " at all , but she definitely exuded a sweetness of disposition . And she was better looking offscreen , minus the heavy Latin-style makeup . Judson decided to eliminate the Mexican " look . " To Rita , Judson seemed a godsend . While he expected things to be done his way ? just like her father ? he was not her father . Judson was immediately successful in getting free-lance jobs for Rita . He knew studio chief Harry Cohn at Columbia Studios , where he got Rita a small part in a film called Meet Nero Wolfe . Throughout 1936 , because of Judson 's efforts , Rita appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohn to sign her to a contract . Cohn had little interest in the young unknown , except for her name . " Latin types are out . She sounds too Mexican , " Cohn argued . The two men decided on her mother 's maiden name , Haworth . They added a " y " to the name , and " Rita Hayworth " was born . Shortly after Rita was signed , her relationship with Ed Judson became  | personal as well as professional . She told a friend she was going to marry him . Both her parents were upset and furious when they found out , feeling that Judson was taking advantage of their daughter . After all she was only 18 . Judson was over 40 . But Rita would not be deterred , and her decision marked the beginning of a painful estrangement from her family . On May 29 , 1937 , Margarita and Ed Judson were married . Judson neglected to inform his young bride of a few details regarding his past . She would be in for a few surprises . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volga , demanded an accounting from Rita 's parents of the girl 's earnings while she had been a member of " The Dancing Cansinos . " Rita was shocked when he insisted that her parents now pay her for her performing . Eduardo and Volga were flabbergasted but complied . Starlet Rita Hayworth appeared in a succession of eight low-budget pictures at Columbia in 1937 . She was working harder than she ever had with her father , but nothing much was happening in the way of public reaction . A change in her appearance was in the offing . Judson felt that Rita 's hairline was too low , and he arranged for electrolysis treatments to change it . Judson eventually took over every aspect of her life ? including choosing her wardrobe . Rita had unquestioning faith in her husband ? until she discovered she was the third Mrs. Judson ! She felt betrayed . Had her family been right all along about him ? But it seemed too late to change anything now . Judson began taking Rita to expensive nightclubs to show her off to important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita 's name was mentioned in columns and her picture was getting into the papers . During 1938 Columbia cast Rita in five more " B " movies . Even Harry Cohn was beginning to take notice . In late 1938 Rita tested for a role in an important film , Only Angels Have Wings . She got the part . Despite Rita 's nervousness on the set , on the screen the 20-year-old woman radiated sexual allure ? an irony considering her strict upbringing and her stifling marriage to Judson . This " sex " quality was simply within her and registered on film . Judson knew this was the time for a big push , and he hired a press agent to make the press and public more aware of Rita Hayworth . The press agent then went to an editor of Look magazine to ask them to do a story on Rita . The editor had never heard of Rita Hayworth , but when the press agent made up the story that Rita spent her entire salary ? $15,000 a year ? on clothes , the editor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the story , Judson and the press agent had to come up with Rita 's spectacular wardrobe . They did so by borrowing clothes from the shops and the department stores all over town The photographer shot many photos of Rita , and one was used as a Look cover . Suddenly Rita Hayworth was getting fan mail , and Judson kept after Harry Cohn to give Rita better roles in better movies . As 1940 dawned , Rita was 21 and already a contender as one of the exciting new screen faces . Director Raoul Walsh had seen Rita on film and thought she would be terrifis in his new project , The Strawberry Blonde ? though Rita was , in fact , still a brunette . Now it was time for another change in Rita 's appearance : She was trans formed from brunette to blonde with red highlights . The Strawberry Blonde was a huge box-office hit , and Rita 's dazzling new look gave her career yet another vital boost . Meanwhile Rita 's marriage was becoming strained . Judson had worked hard to garner his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive it ? and enjoy it ? he wanted to spend more evenings at home . A major turning point in her career occurred when Rita was signed to play the coveted femme-fatale role in Twentieth 's Blood and Sand . Rita would be working for Darryl Zanuck ? the man who had taken Ramona away from her . And now he had to negotiate for her services in his studio 's top movie of the year ! Rita registered on film like a live current of electricity . But her moment of professional triumph was tarnished because Rita was now totally disillusioned with her husband . Even her press agent sadly noted , " It seemed to me that Judson would have sold his wife to the highest bidder if it would have enhanced her career . " After Blood and Sand Harry Cohn finally took the big step with Rita , casting her in You 'll Never Get Rich , with Fred Astaire . In later years Astaire viewed Hayworth , not Ginger Rogers as his " favorite partner . " Life magazine , inspired by the furor over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . For the photo session Rita wore a black lace and white satin nightgown ? and a provocative look . The photo made the cover . The Life cover , appearing August 11 , 1941 , created a national sensation , and the next month You 'll Never Get Rich was released . A star had indeed been born . Rita was the girl , the beauty , the love goddess of the year . By late November of that year , the Judsons had separated . Rita was starting in My Gal Sal , a lavish musical . Since she had initiated divorce proceedings , she had no reason not to respond openly to the attention of her leading man , Victor Mature . She was free for the first time and at last could live the social life she pleased . She dated Errol Flynn , David Niven , and others . But it was her involvement with Mature that was the  | most fun . For the still-married Mature , however , it was much more than that . Meanwhile Rita had reconciled with her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he ? Rita was shocked when he demanded $30,000 to agree to go through with the divorce . She engaged an attorney , and in February 1942 she signed a secret agreement with Judson . It gave him virtually all their jointly owned property , plus at least $12,000 in cash . The divorce was granted in May 1942 . Later Rita gave out certain guarded statements about the marriage . She gave Judson full credit for his contribution to her career , but added , " I never had any fun . I was never permitted to make any decisions for myself . " Soon Judson disappeared from the HoIlywood scene as mysteriously as he had appeared . Victor Mature and his wife had separated and it seemed certain that Mature and Rita would be alter-bound once he was free . In early 1943 Rita was signed to appear in Columbia 's Cover Girl . By now the press and public could n't learn enough about Rita Hayworth . She spent the latter half of 1942 and the early part of 1943 touring with the USO , entertaining at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for servicemen . At 24 she seemed to have the world by the tail . Victor Mature 's wife was in the process of getting a divorce , but Mature now had a formidable competitor for Rita 's hand : Orson Welles . After Welles had seen Rita on film , he announced to a friend that he was going to marry her . Only five years before , in 1938 , the entire nation had become aware of dynamic , flamboyant young Orson Welles via his War of the Worlds radio broadcast . At 23 the brilliant actor/ director became an overnight legend . He 'd scaled new heights with Citizen Kane in 1941 . Welles 's personal life always took a backseat to his work . He had already divorced his first wife , who won custody of their three-year-old daughter . According to one account Rita and Orson met one night at a restaurant . Rita was immediately fascinated by Welles and began seeing him . People in Hollywood scoffed at the alliance of Hayworth and Welles . What on earth did this " Beauty and the Brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other during the courtship . Orson 's many interests impressed and fascinated Rita . He let her be herself . There was no " wear this , wear that , do this , do that . " He was a dazzling fountain of ideas . She had never met anyone like him before . Orson , a monumental extrovert , even by Hollywood standards , was always surrounded by artists , political activists , writers . Rita sometimes felt uneasy . Yet with Orson , she was the happiest she 'd ever been . They were married by a judge in an impromptu ceremony in Santa Monica , Calif. , on September 7 , 1943 . There was no honeymoon , as the bride had to return to work . Newspaper accounts of the wedding said that Rita had been expected to marry Victor Mature . At first Rita 's life with Orson provided her with the carefree adolescence she never had . Both Rita and Orson loved Mexico and they 'd often make trips there . Once , they started nightclubbing at one hotel in Acapulco , took all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxis and musicians when they all wound up at a third hotel . Orson Welles always partied in elaborate fashion . Orson was very protective of Rita because he knew she was unprepared for his way of life . During the early days of the marriage , he was very attentive . Despite myths to the contrary , he realized that Rita was not on his intellectual level and he did not try to mold or change her . But after his Citizen Kane success he was having trouble making the kind of films he wanted to create . Restless , he turned his attention to politics , heading up the " Hollywood for Roosevelt " campaign . When Rita learned she was pregnant , she was elated , certain it would  | bring " Orsie " and her even closer together . On December 17 , 1944 , Rita gave birth , by cesarean section , to a daughter , Rebecca . If Rita had hoped Rebecca would encourage Orson to be the kind of stay-at-home husband she wanted , she was mistaken . In January 1945 he left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was away , Rita received the horrible news : Her mother had died of a burst appendix . " I called Rita on the phone when I heard about her mother , " Orson later said , " and she told me not to come home . I supposed she meant it . I could n't have gotten there in time for the funeral , anyway . " Some say things were never the same between Rita and Orson after this - that she was hurt that he had n't rushed to her side when she needed him most . " When I got back . I could tell she was hurt , " Welles said . After two years of marriage the couple began to drift apart . There was no bitterness or animosity , and the split was very gradual as Orson drifted in and out of Hollywood . Welles was candid about his feelings . " Rita is a beautiful girl , a lovely wife , a perfect mother . When we are together , we have wonderful times . But I have varied interests and man ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconcile . " I want to stay married , " he said . " I 've begged her to wait : ' Since Orson was n't interested in staying home , there was nothing for Rita to do but go back to work . Her next movie was Gilda , and Glenn Ford was cast as her leading man . On screen Rita 's performance was electric . In a key scene she wore a black strapless gown , which started a fashion trend that continues to this day . From the start of Gilda , it was obvious that there was a special chemistry between Hayworth and Ford ? offscreen as well as on . The two became close friends . By the time Gilda was finished filming , Rita had legally separated from Orson . He was in New York and when he flew back to Hollywood he did not get to see her . In March 1946 Gilda hit the theaters , and it surprised even Columbia executives with its power at the box office . From then on , not only were Rita and the femmefatale image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Gilda to men soon to appear in her life . In the full bloom of both her stardom and her womanhood , Rita , now almost 30 , once again made the cover of Life . The issue appeared on the stands a week before she appeared in court for her divorce from Welles . Professionally Rita was never to be happier . She now had her own production company , Beckworth Corporation . For her first production she chose to play the Spanish dancer Carmen in The Loves of Carmen . When filming was finished , Rita wanted a rest . In May 1948 she and her friend Lola Leighter sailed to Europe . While in Paris Rita entered a hospital suffering from a viral infection and had to undergo several blood transfusions . Plans were made for her to go to the French Riviera to recuperate . There Rita met members of the European cafe society ? a group of fast-living , fast-moving people who flaunted and enjoyed their great wealth , frequented fabulous nightclubs , and jumped from one pleasure spot in Europe to another . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charming Prince Aly Khan , 37 . His father , the Aga Khan , was a Moslem religious leader whose followers were scattered throughout the Moslem world . Aly , though , had lived most of his life in Europe and had been educated in England . Though he was married to British heiress Joan Guinness , who had given birth to two sons , Karim and Amyn , the marriage now existed in name only . The Khan family 's wealth was estimated at between $100 and $200 million . But Aly 's father , the Aga , controlled the purse strings and Aly was always on an allowance . Aly drove fast cars , bred fast horses , was always in the right place at the right time , and knew the right people . Among his friends was columnist Elsa Maxwell ,  | the " Social Empress " of International cafe society . Elsa had invited Rita to attend a party she was giving at the Riviera 's posh Palm Beach Casino . Rita , who generally disliked parties , reluctantly accepted . Aly had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the surprise she had in store for him would be worth it . Rita made an entrance worthy of the movie star she was ? wearing a white gown , her red hair flowing . " Who is that ? " Aly Khan asked . Elsa answered coquettishly , " She 's sitting next to you at dinner . " Rita later admitted that after she was introduced to Aly , " We danced and danced and danced . I like to think we never stopped . " Observers would note , however , that it was Aly who seemed swept off his feet . Elsa Maxwell knew that Aly was hooked . He had been interested in meeting Rita Hayworth ever since he had seen Blood and Sand . And Gilda , which had been a smash all over Europe , was his favorite film . Aly was thrilled with " Gilda " in person . Aly was usually pursued by women ? but not in this case . He was the pursuer . Khan entertained Rita royally and romantically at Chateau 1'Horizon , his fabulous villa by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she responded as Margarita Cansino , a girl with no artifice . She had every right to assume , he was falling in love with her ? not " Rita Hayworth . " Before long reporters began to snoop around for details about this fascinating new romance . After all , Rita was still a married woman ? her divorce from Orson Welles would n't be final for three more months . And the prince was a married man also , with no divorce pending . Rita and Aly embarked on a private trip to Spain . Aly had been with duchesses and princesses , but never had he been with a woman this famous . He was entranced by a woman whose beautiful face was her passport ; few people did n't know " Gilda . " In Seville Rita and Aly managed some quiet moments visiting members of the Cansino family . Rita was in her element here , as she danced flamenco with abandon . If Margarita Cansino and Rita Hayworth were not the same person under most of life 's circumstances , they certainly seemed one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in love with her . The press had begun to report on the romance , and it presented a public-relations problem for them . Rita was a mother ; her divorce was n't final . Rita and Aly returned to France . Then , in September , Rita went back to Hollywood . When Aly soon followed , the headlines reported every move of the Love Goddess and the Playboy Prince . In December 1948 Rita picked up her final divorce decree in Hollywood . Aly 's father was particularly disturbed by the publicity , which hardly portrayed his married son as the kind of man who should succeed him as the spiritual leader to millions of Moslems . Those on the scene note that during this period , Aly Khan was totally faithful to Rita , but his intimate friends scoffed that this fidelity could last . Rita , with daughter Rebecca , headed East . She and Aly rendezvoused in New York . A few days later Rita and Rebecca boarded the luxury liner Britannic . So did Aly . So did reporters . Rita , Aly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ended up in Gstaad , Switzerland , where they visited Aly 's sons . Rita discovered Aly 's talent as a father . The boys adored their dad , and Rita was delighted at how well Rebecca got along with Aly and the boys . This was the kind of family life she had always dreamed about . Back in the United States the most shocking rumor now being circulated was that Rita was pregnant . Time would prove the allegations , at this point , untrue , but among the people who believed them was the Aga Khan . The Aga summoned the couple to his Cannes retreat . To his surprise and delight the old man found Rita totally charming . This sweet woman was the " femme fatale " the press was crucifying ? The Aga asked the couple if they were " devoted to each other , " and when they replied they were , he " advised them to get married . " Aly was relieved his father had been so taken with Rita , and he finally started the machinery for his own divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear : that he would marry Rita as soon as he was free to do so . When the couple attended the races at Epsom Downs , outside of London , the crowds were gaping at Rita and Aly , not the racetrack . Aly seemed to bask in the constant attention . Life in a goldfish bowl was a dismal experience for Rita Hayworth . " However , " says a friend , " she felt once they were married , everything would settle down . " A ly admitted to Rita that yes , on occasion , he still found other women desirable , and he promised he would change . But surely she understood he did n't love any other woman . For Rita there was no turning back now . She loved him . She did n't want to turn back . During the months they waited for Aly 's divorce to become final , the couple argued frequently , then made up . Rita sometimes drank to release the tension . In April Aly became divorced , and a wedding date was set . Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-page news . The wedding was a huge affair , held on May 27 , 1949 , in the town hall of Vallauris , a tiny French village . Press and security police pushed , shoved , and shouted as they jockeyed for position to see the bride and groom . Barriers were set up , and the event took on the frantic overtones of a movie premiere rather than a dignified royal wedding . The bride was radiant in a simple , long-sleeved dress of pale blue crepe . A Scarlett O'Hara-like blue picture hat was perched prettily atop her head . After the ceremony flashbulbs exploded into the couple 's faces as they left the town hall to return to the chateau for the reception . As reported in the press , it was the fairy-tale wedding of Hollywood 's most gorgeous glamour girl ? its very first princess . Rita Hayworth had actually found a Prince Charming , and there were few women who , on this day , would n't have wanted to change places with the Love Goddess . The following day the couple left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month from Deauville , France , came Aly 's revelation that Rita was expecting a baby . But Aly was not about to let Rita 's condition dampen his own fun . He painted the town " all colors , and from every end , " according to one friend . And while he had usually been so sensitive to Rita 's moods , he had no second thoughts now about ask-  | ing his friends to " drop over " for lunch or dinner , giving Rita no notice . Rita tried but could not suddenly turn into an Elsa Maxwell-type hostess and made no effort to suppress her anger . Aly continued to screen Gilda for himself at least once a month , a fact that seemed to support Rita 's contention to a friend that Aly had fallen in love with Gilda , not Margarita Cansino . Meanwhile , the estimated month of the baby 's arrival remained a prime topic of gossip both in Europe and in the United States . When it seemed her time was drawing near , Rita and Aly went to a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain there until it was time for Rita to go to the Montchoisi Clinic , where many royal families of Europe went for childbirth . The press tried to pry into the timetable of events , but Aly kept them at arm 's distance . Nevertheless the press found out when Rita went to the clinic . She gave birth to a girl , on December 28 , 1949 ? almost seven months to the day that Rita and Aly were married . The child was named Yasmin . Rita , Aly , and the children went to Gstaad for Rita 's recuperation , and for Rita this brief period was a happy dream . They were together . For Aly it was a happy time also . And both new parents adored the baby . The " rebirth " of the love affair between Aly and Rita was short-lived , however ; neither one seemed to be able to truly accommodate the other . Rita wanted Aly to remain home with her and the children most of the time . That was simply not in his nature , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They returned to the chateau . Aly continued with his social meanderings . Rita often remained alone at night , had a few drinks , and cried herself to sleep . The prince and princess were in London when they celebrated their first wedding anniversary . Rita had n't made a film in two years . Although many luspected , only insiders knew that the marriage was on shaky ground . Now , as Rita was finally entertaining thughts of reactivating her career Aly persuaded her to accompany him on an official tour of Africa . The highly publicized trip was an ordeal for Rita . Aly played bridge with friends by night , and by day attended to official duties . But sometimes Aly would disappear for hours at a time ? occasionally , he 'd even be gone for days . Rita decided to stay in Cairo ; Aly continued on the safari . Later Aly flew back to Rita in Cairo . It was then she told him she was leaving him . He was not opposed to the idea and made no attempt to stop her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . But it was n't really over yet . And it would be Aly who would try to save the marriage ? for reasons other than love .
