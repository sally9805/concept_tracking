Besides the 1975 original best-selling novel in hard cover , Dell is issuing a 2. 5-million-copy tie-in edition , having already sold more than a million copies. // A 2 1/2-hour theatrical version , filmed at the same time as the 10- to 12-hour TV version , will be released in Japan and the rest of the world some time soon , to be followed by a foreign TV version . In addition , Dell is also publishing " The Making of James Clavell ' s ' Shogun , ' " a $10 Delta trade paperback to coincide with the TV mini-series. // " Please , don ' t call it a mini-series , " Mr. Clavell laughs during an interview in the Japan Society here , overlooking a lovely Japanese garden as a traditionally gowned Japanese woman serves us . " Call it a maxi-series. " // Mr. Clavell is a prominent member of a special California tribe known as the " Hollywood Brits , " a group of displaced Englishmen who have made the Los Angeles area their home but have constructed their own tight little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some would say he has paid his dues as a member of any society , having spent three years during World War II in Changi , the infamous Japanese detention camp in Singapore , after serving in the Royal Artillery . Although reluctant to speak harshly about the Japanese , he is willing to say meaningfully that only about 10 , 000 prisoners survived of the 150 , 000 captured in that area . He also admits that much of his first novel , " King Rat , " was autobiographical. // Exactly how authentic is the 17th-century Japan depicted in " Shogun ? " // A Japanese newspaperwoman , vieing the mini-maxi-series with me , referred to it as " an American version of what Japan in the 1600s was like . " She was not at all unhappy with it  --  implying that any additional American familiarity with Japan would be good , even a slightly distorted version. // Said Mr. Clavell : " We got all the best help we could from the Japanese in order to make it authentic . Sometimes it was infuriating . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting they wanted everybody to take off their shoes on the film set . Well , the cameraman didn ' t want to bother all the time . And the Japanese custom is that you never sit on the crack between tatami mats . Well , for camera angles , sometimes the actors would have to sit on a crack . It caused enormous problems . But in the end it was worth it because it is correct and accurate . But after all , we had to go on what ' s been handed down . We weren ' t there in 1600. . . . " // How **28;6219; did <> author Clavell do his research ? " // " I got my point of view out of reading and out of artwork  --  those marvelous Japanese prints of that period . You can ' t research 1600 Japan in Japan , other than in museums . But the Vatican is the greatest source of Japanese material because the Jesuits and Franciscans were the reporters there . The Jesuits were there from about 1550 thorough 1660. " // How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Japan ? // He disregards the questions. // " To create ' Shogun ' I had to know everything about Spain , about Portugal and England of the period because they were the armed forces of the world . Then I had to know about Japan , and if you want to know about Japan , you have to know about China because China has always been the mother of Japan . Zen Buddhism , the calligraphy , the painting they ' ve adapted , the pottery , the eating utensils . But I think the Japanese are more than adapters  --  they are innovators because they take things and make them Japanese. " // Does Mr. Clavell consider himself a Japanese scholar ? // " Absolutely not . I don ' t really consider myself anything but a storyteller . I keep going back to what I ' ve been told . I ' ve been told that my " Tai-pan ' explains Chinese to Europeans and that ' Shogun ' is an insight into the Japanese mind. // " I ' ve spent lots of time in Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent weeks there in various places . But , in a way , I ' ve lived there forever. " // Despite his self-described great ties to Japan , Mr. Clavell doesn ' t feel Japanese . " To be Japanese is to be Japanese . There was a Westerner called Lafcadio Hearn who was so Japanese he wrote better Japanese poetry than the Japanese , his calligraphy was better . But he died of a broken heart because the one thing he did not learn was that he would always be a foreigner in Japan even topugh he could speak Japanese. " // Mr. Clavell is a bit impatient with those who may quibble about his impressions of Japan in his book and film . " Don ' t forget , ' Shogun ' , is the romantic age , it ' s King Arthur and the knights of the round table . There are great parallels between the Japan of the samurai and England . Both countries are islands , don ' t forget. // I ' m nostalgic for the time of the British Empire . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In those days the English people ruled almost incorruptibly . The Indian Civil Service was , I believe , almost uncorrupted in any way . Nowadays , it ' s almost everybody for themselves . I remember my father saying to me when I went off to service , ' Remember , you are blessed by being English . ' I ' ve neve forgotten it . I still feel a responsibility to my heritage. " // Mr. Clavell is now an American citizen although he maintains a home in Surrey in England . " Home is where your books are. . . . " // What does Mr. Clavell plan to do in the future ? He is already a very successful Hollywood screenwriter ( " The Fly " and " To Sir , With Love " and " The Great Escape " ) . Might he do a modern Japanese story ? // ' I ' m already writing something which I call loosely ' Asian Saga . ' ' Shogun 1600 , " ' Tai-pan 1841 , ' ' King Rat 1945 , ' and ' Noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 . It brings ' Tai-pan ' up to date , taking the main characters from ' King Rat ' and bringing them up to date . It also takes the descendants of some of the ' Shogun ' characters and brings thme up to date . So , in effect it is the first of the inyterlocking novels I plan . The next novel I want to call ' Nippon ' and bring ' Shogun ' up to date from Shogun to Perry , Perry to today  --  there ' s not too much difference. // " But these are all long-term plans and I don ' t know if I have the strength to do it all . But if I can pull it off , I can then tell in fiction terms the involvement of the Anglo-Saxon in Asia , from the first man named Will Adams whom I call John Blackthorne up till today . I don ' t know what the sixth book would be  --  maybe " The Empire Strikes Forward , " he laughs . But the interview is convinced that he might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clavell hope the current siring of " Shogun " will accomplish ? // " I think the prime thing is to give people some relaxation . But I hope it will also give people some insight into the character of Japan . No. 1 is to entertain them , take them out of themselves for a period of time as I did in the book . And the second thing is to open their eyes. // " We need Japan from a national point of view  --  and I ' m talking straight politics now . They are our only ally in Asia . And even more important , there ' s a great deal we must learn from them as they ' ve learned so successfully from us in the last 100 years . They ' ve gone so far ahead of us . There are certain things in their attitudes such as a search from harmony , an understanding of their own art . How they are polite to one another . And they have maintained a personal dignity which we have lost. // " I hope this TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real equals , to say : ' Yes , this is a foreign culture but it is a very interesting one . ' After all , it is only a few years ago that we were trying to beat each other to death. " // Mr. Clavell is a bit overwhelmed by the power and the burden investd in him by the mass-audience viewing of the film version of his book. // " ' Shogun ' is . . . most Westerners ' introduction to Japan , " he says , paling just a bit , but smiling in jest as he adjusts his ascot . " That ' s an appalling responsibility ! " // //
