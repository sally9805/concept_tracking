Shelby Gamble occasionally laughs about it now , the quiet laugh of contentment . " I was going to leave , " he said . " I was so mad , I packed my bags . It ' s funny . It started raining . Junior Poles is my roommate , and he said I might as well wait until tomorrow . I ' d cooled down by then . " There were quite a few times during the season I thought about it . I kept changing my mind . As a freshman , you have so many crazy thoughts . Should I leave right now ? I had quite a few doubts . It took me time to know people . It was a big adjustment , a lot of mental pressure . " Why didn ' t I ? I guess it was a couple of things . I didn ' t have a way to get home . I couldn ' t be a failure either . I couldn ' t fail and look my mother in the face . She only knew one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knows . But I was definitely leaving that night . Until it rained . " I was young in the mind . We had lost . Practices were hard . I was homesick . If a freshman can hang on through that , he can make it through anything . It was different . The East is a lot different from the Midwest.College football is different . Now it seems so easy , but last year was tough . " Shelby Gamble was sitting in a lounge in the basement of Roberts Center at Boston College , relaxed and at ease in the world around him . Just four nights earlier , outside in Alumni Stadium , BC had beaten Stanford ( 30-13 ) . BC and Gamble had gone full cycle since that rainy night a year ago . He was a catalyst in the victory , a frolicking running back who rambled through the Stanford defenses for 154 yards in 32 carries , earning him ECAC co-offensive player of the week honors ( with Joe Morris of Syracuse ) and leaving the imagination to ask , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the routine of the East after the uneasiness of a freshman year that saw him gain more yards ( 776 ) than any freshman in the East , undergo shoulder surgery in January , and question if he had , in fact , made the right move . He grew up as a teenager in South Haven , Mich. , a community of some 7000 surrounded by farmland on the Eastern shores of Lake Michigan and , in three seasons at L.C. Mohr High School , he gained just under 4000 yards and had every recruiter in the Big Ten knocking at his door . On the very night he had made up his mind to go to Wisconsin , he answered one final knock on the door . It was his high school coach , Gary Steudel . " I told BC I was going to Wisconsin , " said Gamble . " About 12 at night , he came knocking at my door . He said I ' d made the wrong decision . He knew something I didn ' t know . He had a sixth sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BC ) I ever made . " He was the biggest influence , the driving force in my life . When I was a freshman he said if I did what he told me and trained hard , everything would work out . I could go anywhere . When I was a senior , he asked me to listen to him one more time . " I was so set to go to Michigan for a while . My mother didn ' t want me to go here . I was the baby . I ' m from a family of six boys . All my brothers were athletes . I idolized my brothers . I was the last one to leave . She didn ' t get a chance to see me play much . She worked nights in a GE plant . That ' s one of the reasons I do so well . For my mother . She ' s a good lady . My father didn ' t live with us at times . She was it , the whole support . " I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . But you have to realize things . I wanted to play . I thought my chances of playing here were better . Everybody at home wanted me to go to Michigan . They said it ( going to BC ) was a bad decision . " Steudel received the phone call , the night BC was trounced 43-8 by Tulane , its 17th defeat in 19 games under coach Ed Chlebek . " He wanted to know about transfering , " said Steudel last Friday on the eve of his first game . " Boston ' s a long way from South Haven . I told him , Don ' t blame yourself . One person can ' t do the job . ' I told him to finish the semester , get his grades and , if he was still unhappy , he could always transfer then . One coachfrom a college out here actually said to him , When you flunk out , come here . ' " Why BC ? I knew Ed ( Chlebek ) was a personable guy . I knew him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was above the table . There was no offer of anything illegal to get him . Not every college could say that . I also knew BC ran the same offense we ran , a twin set Veer . " I think he ' s another Billy Sims and I wanted to see him go to a place where he could play as a freshman . He averaged 12.1 yards per carry for three years . As a junior , he had 1700 yards rushing and that particular team led the entire state of Michigan with 25 touchdowns . " He ' s a game breaker , a super athlete . I coached him in wrestling , too , when he went to the regionals in the 11th grade . He doesn ' t like to get beat . He ' ll be fighting . He knows he has to pay the price . He ' s the type of personality who could be a leader in any community . " " I had heard about Gamble when he was a sophomore , " said Chlebek , who was at Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was aware of him . We ( backfield coach Bobby Grier did the personal recruiting of Gamble ) were honest with him . We said , We weren ' t very good ( 0- 11 ) , but we had improved . The guy who really convinced him was his high school coach . " The thing I like about him is he practices every day . He was one of the top freshman backs in the country . He ' s more mature , more confident . I like his ability to find an open hole and his toughness getting there . His potential is unlimited . He ' s starting to realize how good he can become . When you talk about backs we ' ve played against , he has to rank with any of them . I think he can be one of the top backs in the country by his senior year . " BC was coming off an 0-11 season when Gamble arrived in Chestnut Hill . Chlebek went out and recruited against that backdrop , a coach who had been fired and rehired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration to give him more than one year . Gamble became a part of the new wave , the youthful nucleus on an unpredictable team that has been on a peculiar rollercoaster this season , playing No. 4-ranked Pitt tough in a 14-6 defeat , beating No. 16-ranked Stanford and returning to earth with mystifying defeats at Villanova ( 20-9 ) and Navy ( 21-0 ) . In this season , Gamble has seen the highs and the lows . On one weekend , he rushed for more yards ( 154 ) against Stanford than the entire Oklahoma team did ( 153 ) the next weekend when Stanford upended Oklahoma in Norman . On that weekend , BC was losing to Villanova . " I couldn ' t believe it happened , " said Gamble . " It was one of those upsetting moments . " On the following weekend , BC crossed midfield only once at Navy and now faces up to a critical game against unbeaten Yale ( 3-0 ) tomorrow night at 6 in Alumni Stadium . The euphoria that followed the Stanford win has been replaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 10 years of his life in Detroit . " When I lived there , " he said , " I never knew what sports were . " When he moved to South Haven , he found out Friday night football was the only show in town . " To have any respectability , " he said , " you had to be an athlete . " Success followed , the type of success that earned him trips to Notre Dame to see Tony Dorsett of Pitt run wild , the type of success that had him visiting Ann Arbor to see Michigan and Rick Leach beat Ohio State and , after all of the offers , the final trip to Chestnut Hill . There is a quiet depth to Shelby Gamble , a touch of the small town influence that still lives within as he adjusts to life in the city and football at Boston College . " I just like to help the team . I have personal goals , but I keep them to myself . I feel more at ease in practice , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get used to it . I never believed I would . " When he finally did go home for the Christmas break , he found " it wasn ' t like I thought it would be , " and he returned to campus , a freshman set to embark on the rest of his college career . The doubts and the anger of a rainy night in October seemed a long time ago .
