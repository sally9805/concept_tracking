Seldom has a President felt obliged after only seven weeks in office to deny publicly that his Administration suffers from " drift " and " malaise . " But that is precisely what George Bush did at a press conference last week , reciting a list of accomplishments ranging from the savings and loans bailout to proposals for curbing air pollution . " I think we 're on track , " the President insisted , adding somewhat wistfully , " A lot is happening . Not all of it is good , but a lot is happening . " <P> The biggest happening , and the worst for Bush , was the Senate 's rejection of former Senator John Tower for Secretary of Defense by a vote of 53 to 47 . It marked the first time in 30 years that the full Senate had spurned a President 's Cabinet choice , and was a clear indication of which way the power is flowing along Pennsylvania Avenue . Bush moved swiftly to stanch the bleeding by replacing Tower with Congressman Richard Cheney , a Wyoming Republican who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney is expected to win quick FBI clearance and Senate confirmation  --  much to the relief of Bush , who declared , " Too much time has been wasted here . " <P> All week the President was at pains to counter critics who complain that too much time has already been wasted in this new Administration . Despite Bush 's extensive experience in government and his campaign boast that he was " ready on day one to be a great President , " hundreds of key appointive posts remain unfilled and crucial foreign policy decisions are on hold pending completion of some 30 " reviews . " <P> In economic and domestic policy , the White House has been energetic but surprisingly maladroit , hopping among major and minor issues with little continuity or follow-through . The White House has also been inattentive about managing the news and delivering its message to the public , especially when compared with skills of the Reagan Administration or even with the " theme-of- the-day " Bush campaign . " The President has given nobody the overall authority to coordinate people 's efforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior Administration official . " And there 's only so much that even a President as active as this one can keep track of . The rest is falling through the cracks . " <P> The bright side of the Tower fiasco may be that it woke up the White House . " It has got Bush 's attention focused , " says an Administration official . An outside adviser says , " They 've got a major bailout operation under way right now . " On Tuesday night chief of staff John Sununu , ever confident and combative , sought advice from an informal group of outsiders that he occasionally convenes : a dozen former Bush campaign officials and political consultants who gathered for dinner in the Roosevelt Room and discussed how to recover from the debacle . <P> One solace was that for all the Administration 's early failings and flailings , the President 's popularity outside Washington has remained strong : his approval rating has ranged between 59% and 71% in recent polls . For the time being , the President can coast on a strong swell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high . He also continues to benefit from his obvious enjoyment of the presidency , his self-deprecating humor , his grasp of the issues raised at press conferences .
