Real estate brokers have seen it in fewer home sales. // Stockbrokers have seen it in clients who aren ' t as quick to act on their recommendations to buy new stocks. // And even purveyors of mutual funds , those refuges of the common investor , have seen it in the lack of new money coming in. // Almost no one , it seems , is in a mood , or has the capital , to commit additional money to investments of any kind. // // Fortunately for the investment companies , almost all of the old money has stayed with the funds , where the catchwords of diversification and professional management have helped build an $800 billion industry ; investors have just moved their money to safer ground , usually away from stock funds to money-market and short-term bond funds. // For now , at least , investors seem to be less concerned with large capital gains and high yield than with safety of principal and a reliable , steady income. // But trying to lure new money is a problem for most funds . Sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July compared to July 1987 , from $13. 2 billion to $7 billion , according to the Investment Company Institute , the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. // ' ' The new money coming in is about even with redemptions , ' ' says Binkley Shorts , portfolio manager for the Over-The-Counter Securities Fund in Boston . This happened despite the fact that the fund gained 25 percent in the first half of the year , compared to about a 12 percent gain for the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 index. // ' ' I don ' t think the public is in this market , ' ' Mr. Shorts says . ' ' People were so shook up by October they never went back. ' ' // Although the Brady Commission report on the stock market plunge examined many of the issues that are needed to restore investor confidence , he says , there has not been enough follow-up by national political and business leaders to get people interested in committing serious money to the markets , either directly or through mutual funds. // ' ' People don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Thompson , secretary- treasurer of the Janus Funds in Denver . ' ' They are afraid to commit to the market . They are inclined to go with fixed-income ( bond ) funds , but a lot of people had bad experiences there , too . We have not seen a large number of redemptions , but sales are very slow. // ' ' I suspect we ' re losing market share to the banks. ' ' // Small-company funds impressive // Those investors who were brave enough to venture into the stock market through mutual funds have looked for funds that specialize in small companies , where a few million dollars in extra sales can translate into big percentage jumps in profits and stock price. // ' ' The values out there are tremendous in small companies , ' ' says Gerald Perritt , editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago . ' ' There are certain characteristics of this economy that tend to bode well for small companies regardless of what industry they ' re in . You ' re talking about companies that have equity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , sales of $100 million or so . So a 10 percent sales boost adds significantly to their bottom line. ' ' // ' ' The only funds that have been really outstanding ( since October ) have been the small companies , ' ' agrees Sheldon Jacobs , editor and publisher of the No-Load Fund Investor , a newsletter in Hastings-on-Hudson , N.Y. ' ' By and large , they ' re all up : income , growth-income , growth , and aggressive growth . The only thing that ' s really died has been the precious metals . They ' re way off. ' ' // Income-oriented mutual funds , especially , have been the big winners in the last few months , Mr. Jacobs points out . In the last three months , the no-load income funds were up 3. 9 percent , on average , he says , and growth funds were up by the same amount . Small-company funds gained 3. 2 percent , while growth funds were up 3. 1 percent , and aggressive growth advanced 2. 9 percent. // Although these gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still haven ' t been enough to attract many new investors , or to get old investors to commit more money . But the slowdown this year may not be all that bad , if longer-range history is taken into account. // The years 1986 and 1987 were ' ' an aberration , ' ' says A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services in New York , ' ' an aberration caused by excessive money-supply growth . The fund industry FUNDshould compare itself to 1985 . Then the industry produced gross sales of $114 billion . This year looks like $100 billion to us. ' ' // The bull market that ended last October , Mr. Lipper says , made almost every broker or financial service salesperson look good . This ' ' brilliance of the bull market , ' ' where even mediocre salesmen did well just by being order takers , is now history , Lipper says . ' ' Now the customer has to be coaxed into buying and there are fewer people capable of doing that. ' ' // The earning power of $800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic earning power of the industry is in the assets , which are at $800 billion . Just through reinvestment of dividends , the industry is probably going to grow $30 or $40 billion a year . That ' s not too bad. ' ' // What is bad , Lipper believes , is that many of the funds are still carrying heavy costs for marketing and service based not on a more ' ' normal ' ' year like 1985 , but on the aberrations of 1986 and 1987. // ' ' You had lots of marketing people earning more than portfolio people , ' ' he says . ' ' And the key word was ' earning ' because they were generating sales . They ' re not generating sales today , but they ' re still drawing large pay numbers relative to what they are generating. ' ' // This , then , is a time of reassessment for the mutual fund companies . First , they are trying to figure out what the public wants , looking for new products or pushing existing offerings to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ' s attention and let people know those new products are available. // In the 1970s , an earlier period of doldrums on Wall Street , money-market funds were introduced as a way of keeping investors ' money with the funds companies . By the end of that decade , they also had the unexpected benefit of offering a highly attractive alternative to bank savings accounts , which for several years were paying just 5 percent while the money funds paid as much as 16 or 17 percent. // Now , in the final years of the 1980s , the new fund products are far more complicated . Where terms like ' ' balanced ' ' and ' ' growth ' ' were the standards of the industry before , now phrases like ' ' asset allocation ' ' and ' ' investment pools ' ' are heard more often. // Allocating assets in one fund // With an asset allocation fund , the money is typically spread among five or six different types of investments , which might include stocks , bonds , gold and precious metals , international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been introduced by the Colonial Group in Boston , among others. // Other companies have capitalized on the 1986 Tax Reform Act with funds that use sophisticated hedging and trading strategies . That tax law declared that gains from all investments , including such ' ' derivatives ' ' as futures , qualified as income . The law also allowed the exemption of certain hedging gains from the short-term rule , which says that no more than 30 percent of a fund ' s income can come from short-term capital gains of less than 90 days . Several companies , including the Dreyfus Corporation , now have funds that depend on a portfolio manager ' s ability to use derivative investment techniques , like hedging , to cushion sudden changes in the markets . The fund companies even have some help for those investors who thought the safety of bonds funds provided a refuge from the vagaries of the stock market , only to see the value of their principal fall dramatically on two occasions last year . With their portfolios of short-term securities , money-market mutual funds are safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . Longer-term bond funds offer higher yields , but their share price can be far more volatile. // So in the last year or two , most of the major funds , including Putnam , Vanguard , T.Rowe Price , and Fidelity , have FUNDB7B5brought out short-term bond funds . The securities in these mature in just three to five years , compared with the 10- to 20-year maturities of the longer-term funds . For investors seeking even more security , the companies have also provided short-term government bond funds. // One such fund , the Huntington Short-Term Government Mortgage Fund , was reopened to investors on Sept. 6 following a short introductory opening period in late June . At least 65 percent of the fund is invested in short-term United States government mortgage-relates securities , says Donald Gould , president of Huntington Advisors Inc. in Pasadena , Calif. // Stress on safety and income // ' ' It ' s our perception that people ' s priorities have shifted quite a bit , ' ' Mr. Gould says . ' ' Safety , income , and stability have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fund , Gould says , is to give investors 90 percent of the yield of 30-year Treasury bonds with only 20 to 30 percent of the volatility of those bonds . ' ' We anticipate an 8. 5 percent yield ' ' on an annual basis this year , he says. // More-complicated mutual funds , along with more uncertainty about the markets , have helped restore the status of one element in the business that had been eroding somewhat before last October : the salesman . When almost all mutual funds were doing well and the investment strategies were fairly simple , the no-load funds went from having almost no share of the market in the 1970s to more than a 30 percent share in the 1980s . Today , that ' s back down to about 25 or 30 percent . Meanwhile , fund companies that had promoted themselves heavily as no-loads have added sales charges to some funds or opened new funds designed to be sold through brokers or financial planners , who will receive a commission. // Fidelity Investments in Boston , for example , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ' s slump in financial services has resulted in the layoff of 16 percent of its work force ) has added ' ' low-loads ' ' of around 2 percent to many of its offerings , particularly equity funds . And last year , Fidelity introduced the Plymouth Group of funds designed to be sold through brokers , instead of directly to the public , as are the rest of the Fidelity funds. // The funds in the Plymouth Group carry a 4 percent sales charge and a small 12b-1 fee for marketing expenses , says Ronald Gwozdz , Plymouth ' s president . There are four equity funds , four fixed-income funds and three money market funds in the group , he says . Some of them are managed by the same people that run similar Fidelity funds. // The loads get lighter // ' ' Roughly three-quarters of the funds bought , excluding money market funds , are load funds , ' ' Lipper says . ' ' We know that many of the no-load operations are not doing particularly well . There are fewer no-loads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some of those formerly no-load funds that added sales charges did so to get brokers and planners selling them . These funds have found they can sell more this way than they can through advertising or articles in the press. // Reasonable fees and charges , investment advisers say , are acceptable to the public as long as they are fully disclosed and the customers feel they are getting something in return for the fees : research into new funds , explanations of how the funds work , and periodic updates on the funds. // //
