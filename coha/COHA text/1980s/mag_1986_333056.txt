It was the waking nightmare that haunts every American reporter in Moscow . Nicholas Daniloff , 52 , a respected correspondent for U.S. News &; World Report , had been receiving persistent phone invitations to meet with a Soviet acquaintance named Misha . Daniloff , who was busy packing to leave Moscow after a 5 1/2-year stint , kept putting Misha off . Finally they arranged to meet in a park in the Lenin Hills near Daniloff 's apartment . As they walked , Misha edgily pressed into Daniloff 's hands an envelope he said contained newspaper clippings . Daniloff gave Misha a goodbye gift : two books of horror stories by Stephen King . That was when Daniloff 's own horror tale began . <P> As Misha was hurrying off , eight KGB agents surrounded Daniloff , grabbed the package he had been given and hauled him away in handcuffs . They drove him to Lefortovo , Moscow 's infamous maximum-security prison , where they opened the envelope and announced that it contained photographs and maps marked TOP SECRET . After an interrogation in which the KGB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for , Daniloff was stripped of his belt and shoelaces and placed in an 8-ft. by 10-ft. " isolator " cell . Though American reporters in Moscow have been harassed , arrested and expelled in the past , not since Joseph Stalin 's time has a correspondent spent a night in a Soviet prison. * <P> The ruse was such a ham-handed throwback , so lacking in the artful subtlety that the new Kremlin leadership is supposed to prize so highly , that analysts were stunned . One week earlier the FBI in New York City had arrested Gennadi Zakharov , a Soviet citizen employed at the U.N. , after he had bought an envelope filled with U.S. military secrets . Since Zakharov did not have diplomatic immunity , a federal judge ordered him held without bail . The subsequent arrest and jailing of Daniloff offered the Soviets both a bargaining chip and a choreographed symmetry . Or at least so it seemed to them until the sloppy pawn-for-pawn gambit escalated . <P> The problem with the pretense of symmetry was that to most Americans , the pretense so obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost assuredly a spy , nabbed as he took delivery of material that he had specifically requested . Daniloff , according to all reliable reports , was most assuredly not . Declared U.S. News Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman , who immediately flew to Moscow : " Daniloff is no more a spy than Gidget . " Added Daniloff 's angry wife Ruth , after visiting him in prison : " The whole thing is an outrage and a complete and absolute frame-up . Nick is , basically , a hostage . " <P> The ticklish drama could hardly have come at a more sensitive time for Soviet-American relations . Even as the controversy unfolded , Soviet officials were in Washington for talks that could pave the way for a second summit meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev later this year . Those discussions went ahead as scheduled , and plans are still under way for a meeting in Washington next week between Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze . But U.S. officials hinted last week that the Daniloff affair , if not resolved , could endanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
