A conviction in a Mob killing <P> Mob executions normally go unpunished . But the work of New York detectives and Bronx County prosecutors produced a conviction last week in the killing of a federal witness . The team did what the FBI and Justice Department had failed to do : show that Nat Masselli , 31 , had been slain last year in an effort to impede a federal investigation into allegations that Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan had ties to organized crime . <P> New York-area Mafiosi had expected Masselli to testify in Special Federal Prosecutor Leon Silverman 's probe of Donovan 's activities as an executive of New Jersey 's Schiavone Construction Co . Nat worked for his father William , 56 , a convicted hijacker who owned an excavating firm that had subcontracts with Donovan 's firm . Testimony in the Bronx County trial showed that Salvatore Odierno , 68 , and Phil Buono , 68 , Mafia soldiers , had met Nat Masselli last August to talk him out of cooperating with Silverman . <P> The prosecution 's key witness , produced by Detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , William Burns . A longtime informant , Burns claimed that Odierno talked freely about the Masselli killing when the two were inmates last year at New York 's Riker 's Island jail . According to Burns , Odierno got mad when Masselli , sitting beside him in a parked car , rejected a deal in which the Mob would cancel loans to the Massellis if the pair would pledge silence in the Donovan investigation . Burns said that when a device that looked like a tape recorder fell from Masselli , Odierno yelled , " My God , the expletive is wired . Shoot him , Philly . " Buono , seated in back , did so , according to Burns . The jury convicted Odierno of manslaughter . Buono , charged with murder , is scheduled to go on trial this week . <P> Donovan 's name emerged several times in the Odierno trial . Burns testified : " Sal said that Mr. Donovan was just another construction operator , who was looking to buy contracts and then would run out of money , and would need money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The motive behind this crime is the protection of Mr. Odierno and Mr. Buono , their associates and their connections in high political office . That connection , the people assert , is Mr. Raymond Donovan . " <P> Donovan , twice cleared by Silverman on charges of links with gangsters , may soon have a chance to rebut Fisher . He has been listed by Buono 's lawyers as a potential defense witness in the alleged triggerman 's murder trial .
