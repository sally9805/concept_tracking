txt TILE CASE OF Mary Catherine Brady was finally taken seriously Monday . It took long enough . Until there was publicity about her case , Mary Catherine , 21 , who lives in a quiet and tidy far Northwest Side neighborhood of Chicago with her Irish parents , was not taken seriously by many at all in this city . In fact , few were very willing to even listen to what happened to her on the misty morning of July 4 . It is a ** of July Mary Brady will never forget . For it was in the predawn darkness that morning when she pulled up in front of her house and was about to get out of her car that a man , who 'd been waiting in hiding for her , pushed Close-up with Anne Keegan his way into her car , grabbed her around the throat , stifled her after one scream , and pushed her down roughly onto the car seat . He wanted her car keys , he told her . He 'd hurt her if qhe.yelled again . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , take all the money she had , and let her go , let ' her just get up , take his hand off her throat , he did not agree . He did n't just want the keys . INSTEAD , HE fished around for the keys on the car floor ; where Mary had dropped them , and slowly tried out each one until he found the key that fit . Then , he started the car , ready to pull out with Mary Catherine lying terrorized and pinned down on the front seat . Except that Mary Brady 's fiesty , red-haired mother from Ireland heard Mary 's one long scream and bolted upright in bed . And when she looked out the window in alarm , she saw a man 's arm raised up in Mary 's car . She shrieked out of the house in her nightgown and began pounding on the car asi the man was trying to pull away with her daughter in it . A neighbor , off-duty policeman Bill Carroll , heard the scream and came running out of his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did two neighbor boys from across the street . Mrs. Brady 's attack on the car so startled the would-be abductor while he was trying to pull out that Mary got the chance to open the door and jump out. - Bill Carroll and the two neighbor boys chased the man , who himself jumped out and tried to escape . Two blocks away , they caught him . They returned him to the crowd of neighbors who had gathered in their night clothes , angry , and seething in front of Mary 's house , ? impatient to get their hands on him and administer their own streetjustice . BEING CIVILIZED , though , they turned Mary 's attacker over to the Chicago police , just like the law says for them to do . The trouble was , no one else seemed to take the attack as seriously as Mary Brady and her neighbors did . Steven Finney , 22 , the man the police arrested ( or the attack , was already on probation for a felony robbery conviction . He was supposed to be involved in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before he was due to show up in jail . Also , it was learned later , there was a warrant outstanding from June 17 for his violating his probation . Yet he was not held for that . When arrested , he gave police one home address that turned out to be the Elmwood Park post office . The other address he used was his mother 's house . Still , despite this arrest record and his probation conditions , Finney was only charged with a misdemeanor of battery and released that same day from the Austin police station on $100 bond . He was charged with no felony crime at all . He never even appeared before a judge . NO INVESTIGATORS were called to the scene , nor did they question or interview Mary Brady or any of the neighbors or eye witnesses . Later the same day , the man arrested for trying to drive off with Mary Brady in her car , was seen on her street , driving up and down slowly , pausing in front of her house and cruising down the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors who helped catch him were angry . Understandly angry . They could n't fathom it . Something had gone wrong with the justice system , they said . Something had , indeed . . The arresting patrolmen did what they could . They charged the man with a crime , but only a misdemeanor . That is all patrolmen can do : To have a felony charge ' placed against an offender , a police investigator must . be called in , and so must an assistant state 's attorney , from the felony review office , who has to approve the felony charge . Until Mary Brady talked to the press , there were no felony. charges placed at all . No one thought it was worth it . Mary Brady escaped did n't she ? What harm was done ? When Mary Brady did talk to the press , though , she suddenly got everyone 's undivided attention : because it looked bad , this man with a record at ? tacking a nice girl in a quiet neighborhood and getting out on only $100 bond . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before was , released on a $100 bond had been miraculously found and held now on a $55,000 bond . He was now charged with the felony of robbery in connection with Mary Brady 's case . And showing up for the state 's attorney 's office when the case was called was Terry Sullivan , one of the state 's attorney 's biggest guns and one of its most successful prosecutors. ? Mary Brady had finally gotten some attention . Still , she asks , should n't she have gotten it from the beginning ? Should n't she , and every other citizen , get this kind of consideration and treatment when they are the victim of a crime ? without talking to the press ? " What , " she asks , " is wrong ? " Well , Sandy Klapman , of the state 's attorney 's felony review office , says his office did n't press felony charges against Finney because his , office was never notified of the case . " We were never called , " he says . " If we were called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police never notified us , They did not believe , apparently , that they had a felony on their hands . The police were wrong , and they erred . " THE WHEELS were not put Into motion . The investigators did not even bother to handle the case , and none went out on it . We did n't know about this case for several days . " William Hanhardt , deputy chief of the criminal investigations division , says , " We are still looking into it , and it could be our fault . We are trying to ascertain just what went wrong , but even if we were wrong in this case , in 999 cases with . similar circumstances out of 1,000 , felony , review the ' state 's attorney 's office would n't have given us a robbery charge . " In no way would they have approved a robbery charge against him without a Tribune article , without the publicity . It 's a fact of life . It 's a sad feature of felony review that what is happening is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what the police are living with . " Somewhere along the line , - someone slipped up on the case of Mary Brady . Because she and her neighbors got angry and impatient they finally got attention . " But ' it is attention , " Mary says , " that every time victim should get . "
