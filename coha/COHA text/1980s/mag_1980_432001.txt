MUSIC  | When Andre Previn began to conduct small orchestras in the early 1960s , the music world arched an eyebrow . Previn was Hollywood . He was M-G-M 's boywonder composer and conductor , winner of four Oscars and thirteen Academy Award nominations for his film scoring . That was bad enough , but he was also an accomplished jazz pianist and something of a pop celebrity . " Musicians would have forgiven me for being the Boston Strangler , but they would n't forgive me for having worked in films , " says Previn today . Audiences used to come to his performances hoping for Lerner and Loewe . Recalls Previn : " By the time they got in the hall and found I was conducting Stravinsky and Brahms , it was too late for them to get their money back . " Twenty years later , Previn , now 51 , can afford to laugh at all that . His Hollywood years are virtually forgotten ? " People who see late-late movies on TV ask me all the time , Is the Previn who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his career as a serious conductor has elevated him to the world 's great podiums . From 1968 to 1979 he was the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra , and he conducts more than 100 concerts a year with such first-rank orchestras as the Vienna Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony . He is booked through 1983 and has cut a staggering 150 records to date . He is also a composer and pianist of note . He has written music for such artists as Vladimir Ashkenazy and Janet Baker , and he performs some two dozen solo or chamber-music concerts a year . It is his four-year term as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony , however , that is Previn 's biggest achievement to date . When he inherited the 54-year-old Pittsburgh from its longtime conductor , the late William Steinberg , in 1976 , the once highly regarded orchestra was sounding decidedly woebegone . " In his later years Steinberg was ill and became lackadaisical , " says concertmaster Fritz Siegal . " He figured that we would stay together whether he conducted well or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , as well as years of experience with the LSO in TV and recording studios , turned the orchestra around . Pittsburgh landed a recording contract with Angel Records . " Previn and the Pittsburgh , " Previn 's chatty TV series on PBS , was nominated for an Emmy ? and made countless new Pittsburgh fans nationwide . Since then the orchestra has gone on successful tours of the United States and Europe , and it routinely draws nearcapacity crowds to velvet-and-gilt Heinz Hall , its renovated movie-palace home . Last Bow ' : Previn is a low-key maestro . Short and slender , with a pixieish face and quiet wit , he is always immensely polite to his musicians . " Excuse me , " he will say in his Anglicized accent during rehearsals , " that 's not terribly elegant . " In concert he seems almost too controlled on the podium , as if wanting to avoid the spotlight . " You know the European habit of the conductor coming out alone for the last bow , while the orchestra is already offstage ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life when  | I feel more like a twit . I mean , what would I have done with that little stick if the guys had n't shown up ? " Make no mistake , however : Previn knows what he wants , and he is fully in command . He is a fiendish worker ? he often worries himself sleepless while preparing new works ? and demands extraordinary precision from his orchestra . " I like to hear everything that 's on the page , " he says , " plus all the unobvious rhythms ? the kind of pulse , especially in music , that does n't seem obviously rhythmical , that always has to be felt . " Rehearsals can seem like a boot-camp drill . Horns that play an eighth note in place of a quarter note are corrected at once . Pianissimos ? terribly difficult to achieve with a full orchestra ? are practiced until they are properly ghostly . Well-Scrubbed : The result is a rare clarity of sound , enviable teamwork and sharply focused detail , as the Pittsburgh proved recently in the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engaging new work by Previn that was designed to show off the first-desk players , did just that , mingling plaintive wind and string solos with a catchy Shostakovian march tune that kept bursting forth . ( " I could make a good living writing Soviet marches , " says Previn laughingly . ) Britten 's somber " Sinfonia da Requiem " was too straightforward to be stirring . Previn 's reading of Tchaikovsky 's massive Fourth Symphony , however , was masterly . The Pittsburgh is still in transition : the string sound , in particular , is more well-scrubbed than sensuous , and no one would accuse the orchestra of getting carried away . Still , Previn has put Pittsburgh back in the orchestral major leagues ? and it is moving up fast . Born in Berlin in 1929 , Previn studied at the Berlin Conservatory for three years before his family fled to America to escape the persecution of Jews . They arrived in California " dead broke , " and Previn did everything from demonstrating electric organs to playing for dance classes to help out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie ? when he was 18 . " There was a lot of scenery , Lassie barked once in awhile and the rest was music , " he says . " It was heaven . " His early Hollywood years were equally blissful . " I was 16 , 17 , 18 , working at a huge studio during the last gasp of old Hollywood , and I fell for it completely , " says Previn . But he also played chamber music with violinist Joseph Szigeti and studied conducting with Pierre Monteux . Previn 's first major appointment , as conductor of the Houston Symphony in 1967 , did n't work out : " It was a dangerous combination of too much ambition and too little experience . " But he more than lived up to the challenge of the prestigious LSO . " It was a phenomenal gamble on their part , " says Previn . " That it worked out well was , obviously , the biggest thing that ever happened to me . " Favorites : Although there are few complaints about Previn in Pittsburgh , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spending enough time with his orchestra . He is in Pittsburgh only fourteen weeks a year , commuting there from his eighteenth-century house outside London ( where he lives with his twins , Matthew and Sascha , by his third wife , Mia Farrow , from whom he was divorced last year ) . Previn also tends to favor the Russian romantics and twentieth-century British composers , two of his favorites , over both classical and dissonant modern fare . " I ca n't pretend that I have any messianic urge to do new music , " he says . " There is a certain kind of contemporary music that I simply ca n't bring a lot to . " Last year , partly for medical reasons , Previn decided to take a five-month sabbatical ? his first real vacation in ten years . He now plans to take some time off here and there to compose ? " I have no delusions about myself as a composer , but I love to write " ? and play the piano . As for the Pittsburgh Symphony , it is planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new summer season . " If there 's anything wrong here , it 's that the sports teams are the pride of Pittsburgh and not the orchestra , " says Previn . " But you ca n't send the football team to Vienna .
