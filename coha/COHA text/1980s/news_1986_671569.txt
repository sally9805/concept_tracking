The ABC statement came after Mr. Reagan ' s director of communications , Patrick J. Buchanan , told the network in a letter that the White House was " astonished " that ABC had allowed " a trained propagandist " from the Soviet Union to discuss at length Mr. Reagan ' s appeal for Congressional support for his military program. // Mr. Buchanan ' s letter , approved by the White House chief of staff , Donald T. Regan , followed the appearance Wednesaday night on ABC of Vladmir Posner , a commentator for Radio Moscow . Mr. Posner , in his comments from Moscow , responded for eight minutes to questions from David Brinkley about Mr. Reagan ' s speech on the military budget and national security. // In a statement , Richard C. Wald , senior vice president of ABC News , said : " Reluctantly , I tend to agree that Vladimir Posner was allowed too much scope on our program last night . There is nothing wrong with asking a Soviet spokesman for his views of a Presidential speech concerning American posture in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Our production error was in letting him push on at too great a length without an opposing voice to point out the errors and the inconsistencies in what he said. " // // ' A Debate for Americans ' // The ABC statement , shortly after 7 P.M. , came , according to network officials , after Mr. Wald discussed the issue with Roone Arledge , president of ABC News . He is in Moscow with Peter Jennings and other network staff members in connection with the coverage of the 27th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. // Mr. Buchanan addressed his letter to Mr. Arledge . " It is our belief that the debate over what America requires - to defend herself , her allies and friends from the awesome military power of the Soviet Union - is a debate for Americans to conduct , " it read . " Soviet propagandists have no legitimate role in that discussion. " // Mr. Buchanan said he had watched a tape of the interview at the White House this morning after a late-night call from Mr. Regan alerting him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , " who was outraged by it. " // After watching the tape , Mr. Buchanan said , " I was astonished that this individual would have been trotted out to answer the President of the United States on a speech addressing U.S. national security . " Mr. Posner ' s appearance on ABC News followed Mr. Reagan ' s speech and the Democratic response by Representative Jim Wright of Texas , the House majority leader. // An ABC official said tonight that the network ' s initial intent was to allow Mr. Posner to remain on the air " for a minute or two . " But , the official said , Mr. Reagan ' s speech was shorter than the network expected , " and we were handed an extra five minutes. " // " We shouldn ' t have let Posner ramble on , " said the official , who asked to remain unidentified . The official said the network " stands firmly " behind the notion of allowing a Soviet journalist like Mr. Posner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the state , and the views of the journalists who work for them hew rigidly to official Kremlin positions . <> <> ' A Trained Propagandist ' // Mr. Posner often appears on American television as a Soviet spokesman , in part because of his flawless English. // In his letter to Mr. Arledge , Mr. Buchanan said : " We were rather astonished last night , following the President ' s address on the nation ' s security needs and majority leader Jim Wright ' s response - to see ABC give eight minutes of rebuttal time on national television to a trained propagandist for the Soviet Union. // " Mr. Posner performed according to script , disparaging the address as ' dishonest , ' and directly accusing the President of the United States of falsehoods . By putting Vladimir Posner on a plane with the President of the United States and House majority leader Jim Wright , ABC gave this Soviet propagandist a standing he does not merit , a legitimacy he does not deserve. // " Would you have felt it an expression of fair and balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s calls for the rearmament of his country were immediately followed by the BBC ' s granting of an unrebutted commentary to some functionary for the Third Reich ? " <> <> Insult , Says a Legislator // Representative Bob Dornan , Republican of California , said , " This little flunky , ' Vlady , ' sits there and calls our President a liar. // " I ' m tired of having my Government insulted by paid Communist toadies , " Mr. Dornan said in a brief speech on the House floor . " Let ' s put a stop to it . Vladimir Posner was born a Jew . And he covers the anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. " // He then called Mr. Posner " this disloyal , betraying little Jew who sits there on television claiming that he is somehow or other a newsman . It ' s an affront to decency and to Jewish people around the world . " Mr. Posner ' s family were Russian Jews who converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. // Mr. Dornan , a staunch conservative , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong supporter of Israel . His wife , Sally , is a member of a group of Congressional wives formed last May to work for the release of Jewish dissidents in the Soviet Union. // News executives at rival networks reacted in a low-key way to the White House letter. // " It ' s a free country with free speech , and the White House can say anything it believes , it ' s fair game , " said Lawrence K. Grossman , president of NBC News . " But I disagree with the White House . It is appropriate , when the President is accusing the Soviet Union of aggressive behavior , to get a perspective from the people on the other side . We didn ' t do it ourselves , but I see nothing wrong with it . In fact , I think it was a good thing to do. " // Van Gordon Sauter , president of CBS News , said he did not want to comment on ABC ' s editorial judgment , but added , " The issue has never been raised and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at CBS . As for the White House complaints , Mr. Sauter said , " I personally don ' t find it surprising that they complained. " // ABC ' s " World News Tonight " has originated from Moscow all this week , in a highly promoted series of broadcasts pegged to the 27th Communist Party Congress . Much of the top ABC News personnel are in Moscow for the program. // Mr. Posner , who is 51 years old , has emerged as one of the most visible Soviet spokesman on American television . He speaks idiomatic American English , the result of years in the United States when his father worked as an executive for M-G-M . <> <> Editor , Writer , Broadcaster // In 1949 , after his Russian-born father , Vladimir , had been dismissed by the Hollywood studio and blacklisted because of his pro-Soviet views , the family moved to the Soviet-occupied zone in Berlin and in 1952 settled in Moscow. // Vladimir Posner became a Soviet citizen that year , an editor and writer in 1961 , and began his broadcasting career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio Moscow , a job he still holds. // Mr. Reagan was quoted by United Press International as telling a group of bipartisan legislators , " I don ' t know why the hell the media is so willing to lend support to the Soviets . " White House spokesmen , however , said that they were unaware of the comment. //
