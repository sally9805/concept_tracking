The state said that in many cases the staff of the 583-bed hospital had failed to administer indicated tests or procedures to patients admitted with serious conditions . In some cases , the report said , the staff failed to monitor patients ' response to treatment during recovery from surgery or other procedures , leading to a worsening of the patients ' condition and sometimes death. // The report was the second highly critical state report on a New York City hospital this week . The first involved a small private hospital in Brooklyn where , officials said , eight patients died after insufficient care and supervision. // At Lincoln Hospital , one 40-year old patient who was admitted complaining of rectal pain and fever waited four days before seeing a doctor and died , the report said . A woman who experienced difficulty in child delivery had a Caesarean section and died when doctors failed to notice and arrest substantial blood loss , according to the report. // The emergency ward was found to keep patients for as long as six days in holding rooms and hallways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , based on the first full-fledged inspection of Lincoln in three years , called the hospital " in critical need of major improvement " and said the city ' s Health and Hospitals Corporation " is not fulfilling its legal responsibility " to maintain adequate control. // It said a severe shortage of nurses , poorly kept medical records , irregular supervision , spotty review of medical incidents and numerous other deficiencies had contributed to the hospital ' s failure to maintain proper care in 19 cases , including 12 in which the patients died . <> <> Limited Resources // Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford , president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation , yesterday acknowledged problems at Lincoln but defended its management and its staff , saying they were struggling with limited resources. // Lincoln Hospital , serving one of the city ' s poorest areas , has long battled morale problems , allegations of corruption by administrators and more difficulty recruiting personnel than even other municipal hospitals , which must compete with a diverse group of private hospitals for the limited pool of health-care workers. // A spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deficiencies reported at Lincoln Hospital : " People are up against problems like we haven ' t seen before in New York . " He added , " As things like the drug crisis and the nursing shortage grow in magnitude , problems like this are likely to recur. " #30 Days to Respond The Health and Hospitals Corporation , which oversees 16 hospitals as well as other public health facilities , has 30 days to respond in writing . In its reply , the hospital must indicate aspects of the report it plans to contest and give a preliminary indication of its plans for corrections . In most cases , deficiencies cited in the report must be corrected within three months. // The report , based on a three-week survey last month , said that in emergency service , nursing , anesthesiology and surgery , minimum standards were not met . It also criticized New York Medical College , the hospital ' s teaching affiliate , whose medical-care services and supervision , it said , were " not in compliance with the State Hospital Code requirement. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed assertions by nurses who complained in anonymous telephone calls to news organizations that two infant deaths at the hospital ' s maternity ward resulted from severe understaffing . <> <> A Campaign of Criticism // A local group , South Bronx Churches , has since led the criticism against the hospital ' s management , asserting , among other things , that the hospital was unduly dominated by a Bronx political figure , Ramon Velez ; that the practice of job-selling was widespread , and that drug abuse and illicit drug sales were common among patients and staff members. // Responding to the report , details of which were published yesterday in The Daily News , Dr. Boufford said , " I definitely feel that it is a well-run hospital . " But she said many of the problems at Lincoln grew out of a nursing shortage of " national dimensions. " // The report itself said many of the Lincoln staff members " are struggling valiantly with shortages , overcrowding and other adverse conditions. " // Reacting to the report , a spokesman for South Bronx Churches , Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reality. " // As a result of the state ' s criticisms , Dr. Boufford said , " we will try to diminish the workload on the nurses so they can practice nursing so they can center attention on the patients who have the most acute needs. " // She said one measure announced yesterday , the appointment of Dr. Billy Jones , the current chief of psychiatry at Lincoln Hospital , to the position of interim medical director was intended to establish an " effective quality-control program within the medical staff. " // Dr. Boufford said other corrective actions to be taken immediately included the naming of a new chief and deputy chief of medicine at the hospital , quality-assurance critiques of each of the hospital ' s departments and the creation of a new specially staffed emergency-room holding area . <> <> Disciplinary Action // Dr. Boufford , citing an investigation by her agency into this summer ' s incidents of infant death at Lincoln , said there had been no conclusive evidence of improper care or negligence . In each of the individual lapses in patient care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be conducted and " disciplinary action will be taken in the case of doctors or other staff members who have failed in their duties. " // In another critical hospital survey released this week , the State Health Department cited a failure " to insure that all patients are provided with acceptable quality of care " as a factor in the questionable deaths of eight people at Kings Highway Hospital , a 212-bed private hospital in Brooklyn . Its staff , the report said , had failed to properly diagnose , monitor and treat patients whose conditions were serious. // The hospital ' s administrator , Sheila Butstein , said , " We have not yet had an opportunity to review the report , but we treat over 8 , 000 patients a year and we have a very high level of care. " //
