A new book attacks Kissinger <P> Richard Nixon 's White House was not a place for men who would shrink from bitter infighting or who lacked driving ambition . Henry Kissinger was certainly in his element there . And seven years after he left the Government , he is still a significant figure on the public stage who draws fierce loyalists and unrelenting foes . A leader among the foes is Seymour Hersh , who won the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting of the story of the My Lai massacre . <P> In a new book , The Price of Power : Kissinger in the Nixon White House ( Summit ; $19.95 ) , Reporter Hersh sets out , metaphorically , to massacre Kissinger . Hersh quit the New York Times four years ago to devote himself to this project . In 656 pages he blends some new versions of old rumors with some new research ( especially about the Paris peace talks that ended the Viet Nam War and about the intricate negotiating leading up to SALT II ) that add up to a most unflattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the assertion that during the 1968 presidential campaign , Kissinger secretly supplied the Nixon camp with inside information about the Paris peace talks , then being conducted by the Johnson Administration . At the same time , Hersh claims , Kissinger was also offering to turn over damaging files on Nixon that had been compiled by the Rockefeller campaign staff , for whom Kissinger had worked , to Zbigniew Brzezinski , then Hubert Humphrey 's foreign policy coordinator . Kissinger has written in his memoirs that he was approached by both campaigns for advice . But Hersh , quoting some former Nixon campaign officials , paints Kissinger as a double-dealing job seeker . Last week Kissinger angrily denied these specific charges as " a slimy lie . " He said what he had read of Hersh 's writings about him " is untrue , is distorted , or uses totally interested witnesses , many of whom were dismissed after a year of serving on my staff . " But he refused further comment on the work . <P> In the introduction to his book , Hersh takes dutiful note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of China , the SALT treaty , the end of American involvement in Viet Nam , most prominent among them . But Hersh denigrates even those accomplishments , concluding , for example , that Kissinger " cheated " his way to a summit and " lied " about the SALT treaty . Hersh adds scattershot allegations about a number of international events and situations , including charges that Nixon received a large cash contribution to his election campaign in 1968 from the military junta that ran Greece in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
