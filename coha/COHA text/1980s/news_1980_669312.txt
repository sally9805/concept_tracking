No matter how much women earn , or inherit , or how little they earn or have , many are seeing the necessity , in this period of high inflation , of protecting what they have and taking control of their financial affairs . A rash of investment books especially for women has appeared in bookstores , along with more money-information columns in magazines and newspapers. // More women ' s banks have been organized to serve the specific needs of women . Community colleges are offering more courses in money management . And brokerage houses are giving far more thought to ways to attract women investors. // But while more women are making and investing their own money , they feel a knowledge gap . In a recent survey of working women conducted by the Investment Company Institute , about 25 percent said they lack the education to make the right decisions , are afraid to lose money , and don ' t know who to trust . The new courses and seminars aim to help dispel doubts , although none can guarantee the making of wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker or adviser who knows all the answers. // Merrill Lynch , Fenner &; Smith Inc. , the nation ' s largest investment firm , has offered seminars to more than 65 , 000 women since launching its national women ' s program in 1976 . The seminars are refined each year and now cover such topics as how to get personal financial goals , understanding the language of investing , how to select a financial adviser , retirement planning , and tax-favored investment stategies . Merrill Lynch first launched a series of " fashion and finance " seminars through department stores . It ' s seminar called " Financial Freedom , Taking The First Steps , " is now given at breakfast sessions , for the most part , and an advanced course in investing is offered to women who complete it. // " Don ' t protect me . Educate me so I can protect myself , " is the plea of most of the women who take these seminars . Many of the women learn for the first time that in 20 years , if inflation continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just to maintain their current standard of living. // Eighteen months ago , Bache Halsey Stuart Schields Inc. began taking its own " Especially for Women " seminars around the country . A recent seminar was given in Corpus Christi , Texas , to a standing-room-only audience of 500 women , and each month the response grows . The idea of this company is to give the basic precepts of investing in clear , simple language , and to step women through the investment process so that they can understand exactly what happens to their money and how the stock market operates. // Bache has found that the apprehensions of first-time investors are essentially the same for men and women . The question that those who conduct the seminars hear most frequently is , " I only have $2 , 000 to invest , so do you think anyone will talk to me , or answer my questions , or return my phone calls , or will I be just brushed aside ? " Reassurances are given , but no guarantees of making a connection with a nice broker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which launched an early women ' s program about six years ago , has now withdrawn for a season to think over its approach . It is now analyzing the women ' s market before developing a new plan . " We discovered that there was no women ' s block of a market , " reported the company ' s information department , " but that there was a great diversity of women ' s markets . A single girl who has but $10 extra a week to save or invest , is far different from a wealthy widow , or a mature career woman , or a housewife who is struggling to put some of her housekeeping money into a family nest egg . Not all women are looking for the same financial service , so we are looking at new means of approach. " // Other brokerages have worked out appeals to women investors at local levels. // The advice at the core of these programs is " Don ' t feel that money matters and investments are such complex subjects that they can never be assimilated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and define her financial objectives . Most of them show women that no matter how little or how much she invests , she must think through and tailor an investing plan to her own age , income , and financial responsibilities. // Statistics show that , already , 50. 3 percent of stockholders are women . Many want to become more knowledgeable so they can make more responsible decisions. // The US Census Bureau estimates that 85 percent of all American women who are now married will one day be living alone , because of wodowhood , separation , or divorce . This is yet another reason for women wanting to take some of the mystery out of investment planning. // Another reason for increasing concern of women with money matters is that approximately 45 percent of all marriages now end in divorce . Only 14 percent of these divorced women are awarded alimony , and but 44 percent receive child support . This means that increasing numbers of divorced or widowed women are having to provide for themselves and their children. // Because so many women have missed out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average pension of retired women in the US today is just $80 per month . The US Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 50 percent of American women , 65 years old or older , have incomes of less than $3 , 000 a year. // On the more positive side , there are 41. 2 million working women who bring home paychecks totaling an estimated $390 billion each year . And women today control the spending of about half a trillion dollars a year , so they know more about money than they usually give themselves credit for. // It may be a slow process . But women are waking up to their money responsibilities and are beginning to assume some control and to search out at least some of the approaches and answers to savings , insurance , and investment programs. // //
