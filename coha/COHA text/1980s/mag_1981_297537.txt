The Korean evangelist is charged with tax evasion <P> When it comes to legal troubles , there is nothing much new under the heavens for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon , the South Korean evangelist who since 1971 has claimed to be acting in the U.S. under direct instructions from Jesus Christ . Parents whose teen-age children have been lured away from home and into Moon 's Unification Church have lodged kidnaping charges against the church . New York City tax authorities have won court rulings declaring that religion is not the " primary purpose " of the church and that some of its property in the city is thus not exempt from taxation . The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is seeking to deport Moon and his wife Hak Ja Han , contending that she falsified papers to gain status as a permanent resident alien , making her husband 's residency illegal too . <P> Moon 's toughest challenge yet from the temporal powers came last week , when a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted the Korean for tax evasion and conspiracy . The detailed 19-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District of New York , charges that Moon and one of his chief aides , Takeru Kamiyama , conspired to evade federal income taxes and that Moon filed three false tax returns for the years 1973 , 1974 and 1975 . Kamiyama helped Moon file the alleged false returns and is accused of submitting false documents and lying to the grand jury . <P> Specifically , the indictment charges that between March 1973 and December 1975 , Moon deposited some $1.6 million , mostly in cash , in bank accounts held solely in his name at the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York . According to the indictment , these accounts earned $112,000 in interest , which Moon failed to report as income . It was taxable , the Government contends , because he used the funds for " personal and business purposes , " not for church-related religious expenses . The indictment also states that Moon and Kamiyama in 1973 formed a company , Tong II Enterprises , to import ginseng tea and other items from Korea for sale in the U.S. Moon received $50,000 worth of stock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the receipt of the stock as taxable income . <P> As they have in the face of past legal actions , officials of Moon 's church said that he and the church were the victims of Government harassment . Mose Durst , president of the U.S. branch of the church , linked the indictment with " the assassination of President Sadat , the attempted assassinations of President Reagan and the Pope , " and charged the Government with " the attempted assassination of the Rev. Mr. Moon and the 3 million members of the Unification Church . " He contended that the money in Moon 's account had been " held in the Rev. Mr. Moon 's name for the benefit of the church " and that all of it had been spent for church purposes . He accused acting U.S. Attorney William M. Tendy , whose office sought the indictment , of " looking for cheap headlines , not justice . " Added Durst : " Ronald Reagan said that he was going to get the Government off our backs ; he did n't say that he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Moon , he was apparently out of the U.S. , perhaps in Europe , and his aides said they were unable to reach him .
