 | Stefan Dzierzek , 70 , did n't look like a dangerous criminal . His hair was white , his hands were smooth and his smile and soft voice suited his calling as a priest . So when police hauled the dignified Jesuit into Wroclaw 's Strzelin Prison , the new prisoner startled his jailers . " I 'll call you back , " one guard whispered into a prison phone as he watched Dzierzek , still clad in black robe and clerical collar , head for the lockup . " We 've got a strange case here . " Father Dzierzek is one of Poland 's radical priests , a very small but very bold group who made the pope 's toughest audience last week . They number only a few among the nation 's 21,000 Roman Catholic clergymen . But with their intense devotion to justice , human rights and Polish nationalism , they have challenged both the Communists and the leaders of the Polish church . Convicted of collecting money to help Polish defendants pay fines , Father Dzierzek spent 18 days in jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , a bomb tied to a brick landed in the Warsaw quarters of Father Jerzy Popieluszko . Burglars have twice broken into the Gdansk home of Father Henryk Jankowski , Lech Walesa 's unofficial adviser . One outspoken Jesuit at Radom received a package containing the severed head of a dog . The activists insist they are not " political " radicals . " My goals and aims are to tell the truth without worrying about the consequences , " says Father Leon Kantorski of Podkowa Lesna . Spreading the truth takes many forms . In his church at Kalisz , Father Dzierzek protested the December 1981 clampdown with a nativity scene in which Jesus lay on a Polish flag ? surrounded by barbed wire . At Zbrosza Duza , a farm community , the Rev. Czeslaw Sadlowski invites guest experts to lecture ? during mass ? on everything from economic history to modern irrigation . Warsaw 's Father Popieluszko says a special " Soli- darity mass . " In one sermon , he thanked the Virgin Mary for protecting Poland in 1920 from Russia 's " godless Bolshevism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church must take greater care to prevent political demonstrations from being held " under the guise of religious rites . " But the activists have not been intimidated . When a militia commandant sent Father Dzierzek a letter listing all the occasions on which he had " abused " or " ridiculed " martial-law regulations , Dzierzek read the letter from his pulpit . And he called upon plainclothesmen in the church to take out their notebooks and pencils ? so they could get his words down right . Sacrifice : Polish primate Jozef Glemp faces a deep split with the activists , who disapprove of his moderation . " He says he wants to avoid bloodshed in the streets . Of course , no one wants victims , " says Kantorski . " But you can not lead the way to victory without sacrificing people . That is against the Bible , where Christ sacrificed on the way to victory . " At one church meeting the activists demanded more militancy from Glemp , reminding him that one pope even confronted Attila the Hun as he marched on Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ZOMO riot police , " one priest said . " Maybe they would beat us . Then we could see who is beaten and for what . " In Glemp 's view , the church 's brief is not only to avoid strife but to survive as an institution strong enough to press for liberalization in the years ahead . " The Solidarity underground is a struggle for struggle 's sake , without a program , " he told the radical priests . " We ca n't join embitterment that is topical only for today . " But since then , Glemp seems to have toughened his line against the regime . And that should suit Pope John Paul II . At a Warsaw Memorial service last week , the pontiff hailed Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski , who alternately cultivated and defied the authorities , as a " tireless herald of the dignity of every persoh and of the good name of Poland . " It sounded like a call for both prudence and a good deal more protest . @#           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
