Unlike most other magazines in Colombia , Semana is not tied to any political party . It has a reputation for reporting events in a neutral manner , without editorializing . None of the articles are signed . While this policy is not for security reasons , it has proved to be wise in the atmosphere of terror enveloping Colombia today. // // Mr. Lopez calls the magazine ' s efforts at neutrality ' ' a tightrope act . ' ' He says the Colombian press is in general practicing a great deal of self-censorship , but that the result is responsible , prudent journalism. // He agreed to an interview at his hotel the day after the awards ceremony . Some excerpts : // Monitor : What is the Colombian assessment of the war on drugs ? // Lopez : Many Colombian people feel they are fighting America ' s war . The $300 billion demand for drugs you have in the US right now is certainly going to produce someone to supply that demand . We hope to eradicate drugs from Colombia , but I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . With the amount of addiction you have , another country - it could be Peru , it could be Bolivia - could satisfy that demand. // We don ' t produce the drugs : The drugs are produced in Peru and Bolivia . . . . We just get the violence , and - to a much lesser extent than people realize - the money , because the money the drug lords make is left outside of Colombia. // What ' s on Colombians ' minds now ? // We are more concerned about terrorism than we are about drug-running . Because terrorism is so intense , drug running has achieved a secondary priority . Every week there is a political assassination in Colombia . Or . . . a judge is killed or a journalist is killed , or a plane is blown up . We really feel in a state of panic. . . // Imagine if in the United States you had , this week , ( Washington Post executive editor ) Ben Bradlee murdered ; next week , a bomb destroying Rockefeller Center ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air . Later , the attorney general murdered . After that , the leading presidential candidate . That ' s more or less . . . what we have seen in Colombia in a three-month span. // What do the drug lords hope to gain from the violence ? // The drug traffickers want to be treated as political prisoners , not as common criminals , so that they may be invited to the negotiating table in the same way that the government invited the guerrillas . They are exercising pressure to be considered an institutional problem . They would be willing , they say , to retire from drug trafficking forever. // What is the relationship between the guerrilla groups and the drug traffickers ? // Six weeks ago there was an attempt to sign a peace treaty between the guerrilla groups and the drug traffickers . The largest guerrilla group , FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) and the drug traffickers are now in a state of war because the leftist party in Colombia , the Patriotic Union , has had 700 of its militants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives , deputies. . . // Why do the drug cartels murder leftists ? // The drug traffickers have been identified as people who are hostile toward communists and that is one of the bases for them to request political treatment . They said ' ' the guerrillas are against capitalism ; we are against communism ; so why are we going to have different treatment than they ? They have killed a lot of people in their war against capitalism , and we have killed a lot of people in our war against communism. ' ' // What are their motives ? // Their motives are to not spend the rest of their lives in jail in the United States , or in the jungle in Colombia . Right now , they have no choice : Either they are extradited to the United States where they have life sentences , or they live the rest of their lives in the jungle , surrounded by hundreds of bodyguards. // If you have $5 billion and you live in the jungle , the $5 billion isn ' t going to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools and Cadillacs . These people miscalculated their situation and now their lives , in terms of their aspirations , are meaningless . So they want out - but through negotiations . They would like to be treated with benevolence by Colombian justice. // Where do most Colombians stand on the issue of talks ? // The Colombian public is intimidated , and in opinion polls , more than half show a willingness to arrive at some sort of negotiated solution . But the fact that the people have been intimidated does not mean the government is willing . This government would under no circumstances change. // ( The drug lords ' ) hope is that the next government can start from zero - and the current government has only six months left in its term . Some candidates are willing to talk about negotiations . But the front-runner , Cesar Gaviria Trujillo , is a hard-liner. // Nobody in the Colombian media has ever written one single line in favor of sitting down and negotiating with the drug traffickers . Nobody . The media does not believe in it. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the drug flow ? // Nobody thinks that if these people are arrested the drug trafficking would stop . . . But they know that terrorism would stop. // In Colombia , what effects of the American drug effort can be seen ? // The assistance the American government is giving the Colombian government is considered by us symbolic , a friendly gesture . Many Colombians think the military hardware ( the US is giving ) is intended to fight the guerrilla groups later on , not the drug traffickers now . We are receiving some airplanes which are used for bombing : But you don ' t bomb drug traffickers . So the only useful thing we have received is a few Black Hawk helicopters. // To track down these drug lords , you need a lot of electronic devices , not planes . . . . But helicopters are very useful . Now you could say , ' if this is the greatest crusade in the history of mankind , are three helicopters enough ? ' // Can the United States expect resolution of its drug problem on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you eradicated it there , another country would take Colombia ' s place . We are just at a geographical point at which it is convenient to send the drugs to the US . But I think the United States should be more concerned about addiction than about interdiction. // The two governments have made very serious efforts to stop drug trafficking . In Colombia , you have an all-out war to stop this . In America , you have a huge effort . But you have budget problems . . . . If by the end of this century the situation is exactly like the one in which we ' re now
