The new Prime Minister : decisive , agile and pro-American <P> In a country famed for its advanced technology , the vote-counting ceremony in Tokyo last week had a strangely archaic flavor . White-jacketed party workers carried cardboard boxes full of ballots across the floor of the city 's cavernous harbor-front International Trade Fair exhibition hall . They tallied 974,150 mail-in votes by hand , then stuffed the ballots into green plastic baskets for a final scrutiny by election referees . Finally came the announcement that 58% of the members of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party ( L.D.P. ) had picked Yasuhiro Nakasone , 64 , to succeed Zenko Suzuki , 71 , as their president . When , two days later , the choice was confirmed in a vote of Japan 's Diet ( parliament ) , where 421 L.D.P. members form a majority , Nakasone automatically became Prime Minister . Said Nakasone : " Confronted with the times , the nation expressed its need for strong leadership . " <P> Nakasone 's predecessor was never known for that quality . Suzuki , a compromise candidate chosen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed an embarrassing reputation for indecision and incompetence . Although Nakasone ( pronounced nock-ah-so-nay ) will not deviate from the free-enterprise , pro-Western policies of his predecessors , he comes equipped with a solid understanding of defense and economics , two of the most pressing issues on his agenda . A seasoned administrator who has held five Cabinet posts over the past 23 years , Nakasone is , perhaps most important , a decisive and agile politician who knows what he wants and how to get it . <P> The vote underlined a fundamental reality of politics in the right-of-center party that has ruled Japan without interruption since 1955 . Winning the Liberal-Democratic leadership is seldom , if ever , a matter of personal popularity . Instead , victory requires the support of powerful backroom leaders who personally control significant factions in the party 's parliamentary group . Nakasone 's candidacy was supported by the two most prominent factional chieftains in the Diet : Suzuki and former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka , 64 , who retains his influence in the L.D.P. despite the fact that he faces a court verdict next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The machine-style politics of the Liberal-Democrats has been a source of party strength over the years , but lately internecine squabbling has paralyzed the institution . Suzuki held on to power by saying , and doing , virtually nothing . Finally , when faced with such growing problems as a rising budget deficit , Western displeasure with Japanese trade surpluses and the need to prune a mushrooming government bureaucracy , Suzuki announced in October that he would resign as soon as a successor could be named .
