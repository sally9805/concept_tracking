Since then , people in Root - and in 31 other rural towns and villages that lie within the candidate areas - have cleared libraries of science books , jammed public meetings and formed groups with names like Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping and the Coalition for Safe Communities . Over the weekend , organizers from all 10 areas got together at a hotel near Oneonta and formed an umbrella group called Don ' t Waste New York. // The New York State Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission , the agency charged under state law with finding a site , has tried to allay fears by insisting that the technology at the disposal site would be so advanced that the health of people living nearby would not be threatened. // // Skepticism Over Promises of Safety // But residents in and around the proposed areas said they are skeptical of such claims . Hundreds of people , many of whom said they had never given much thought either to nuclear power or to political demonstrations , are vowing to fight the waste sites. // " I don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump , " said Jim Hernigle , a mechanic for the Highway Department in Root , which is about 35 miles east of Utica. // " This is the same government that gave us a collapsing Thruway bridge , " said Jean Veeder of Fultonville , which is next door to Root . Both towns are a few miles from a bridge that came apart over Schoharie Creek in April 1987 , sending 10 motorists to their deaths. // Under a Federal law , New York State must find a place in the state to put the waste by 1993 . All the waste is now sent to sites in South Carolina , Nevada or Washington state , but those states said they could not continue to handle the large volumes and pressed Congress to require each state , either individually or working in compacts , to handle the waste themselves. // Low-level radioactive waste is generated in nuclear reactors , hospitals , research centers and companies that are licensed to handle radioactive materials . It includes such items as workers ' clothes , tools , machine parts and resins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 , 000 cubic feet of waste created in the state each year , the commission must under state law settle on a place with low population density , but outside Federal and state parks or Indian lands. // Using those criteria , the commission came upon usually tranquil , rural places like Root . But reaction to the selections has been anything but calm. // " How do we know they could keep this thing from leaking ? " asked Joseph J. Frank , a retired structural engineer who was a founder of the Montgomery County chapter of the Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping . " How can they be sure it won ' t crack ? There ' s nothing they could do to make us feel really safe if they went ahead and built it . " Mr. Frank lives in Charleston , which together with Root and Glen is in one area identified as a possible host. // Timothy Lane , a produce farmer who is also active with the group , agreed . " You look and see what happened to Chernobyl , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom line is , there ' s radiation in there . " <> <> ' Don ' t Waste Our Children ' // Mr. Frank and Mr. Lane were two of nearly 1 , 200 people - hundreds more were locked outdoors - who attended a public meeting on the waste site last month in Fonda , the Montgomery County seat . Townspeople brought signs that read , " Don ' t Waste Our Children , " " Save Our Cows " and " Save Us All . " Some shouted at members of the state commission who came to explain how the selection process worked. // The five members of the commission have received a hostile reception in the other areas they have visited as well . Many people in the small towns have wondered aloud why , under the law , the material - if it can be handled safely - can not be placed in high-population areas like New York City. // Exhausted after several days of the public meetings , the commissioners ended one session at 1 A.M. last month in Norwich , near Oneonta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people jeered at the decision . " This thing is going to be here for an eternity , and they couldn ' t afford another hour or two , " one local official said. // Angelo F. Orazio , the chairman of the siting commission , said that he understood people ' s fears but that they should not deter the commission from finding the most suitable site. // " People have this image of the state dumping this stuff in the ground and walking away from it , " said Mr. Orazio , an electrical engineer from Long Island who served in the State Assembly from 1975 to 1985 . " Of course it won ' t be that way at all . There ' s no question in my mind that we can build an absolutely safe facility . " <> <> ' Keep Poison in a Poisoned Area ' // But such reassurances do not satisfy opponents , many of whom point to the state ' s problems with a previous waste plant , the Western New York Nuclear Service Center , about 30 miles southeast of Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seeped into the plant . Mr. Orazio said the technology planned for the new site , like that now in use at the three existing sites in other states , was more advanced than that used at West Valley. // The commission will decide between storing the waste deep underground and storing it in fortified structures above ground. // Several local groups have asked the state to find a site on the grounds of one of the state ' s six operating nuclear power plants , and in general to try to keep the waste where it is generated. // " They should try to keep poison in a poisoned area , not bring it into a pristine area , " said Gary Michael , a crafts dealer who lives in Taylor , N.Y. , and who helped form a group of concerned residents from Cortland County. // Mr. Michael said the state ' s booklet " Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management in New York " should be titled " How to Bribe a Bumpkin . " <> <> A Narrowing of List // The state says that nuclear plants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage and that the idea of keeping waste on-site is not practical when more than 1 , 000 institutions across the state are licensed to handle radioactive material. // The commission plans to narrow its list of 10 areas to eight much smaller sites by late spring. // The present list includes two areas in Chenango County , one that includes parts of Orange and Ulster Counties , and one each in Allegany , Cayuga , Clinton , Cortland , Montgomery , Oswego and Washington Counties. // New Jersey and Connecticut have formed a compact to deal with their low-level waste , but that agency has not yet identified possible sites. // New York State has been accused of taking an overly technical approach to the fears expressed . A Department of Health report concedes an impact on " Quality of Life ( e. g. , uncertainty , stress , anxiety ) " for communities on the final candidate list and then suggests " proposed offsets " that include grants of up to $50 , 000 per county. // Members of the statewide coalition , however , said they will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump . They plan to march on Albany next month. // Mr. Orazio said the commission would move ahead with its process. // " This is the law , " he said . " The facility is going to be built . I understand the concerns out there , but all I can tell you is we ' re going to make it as safe as humanly possible. " //
