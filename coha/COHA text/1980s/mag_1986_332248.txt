. The 1982 Falklands War came back to haunt both sides in the conflict last week . In Buenos Aires three former junta members were convicted of bungling the ten-week conflict that ended in humiliating defeat for Argentina . Former President Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri , 59 , who launched the war , was sentenced by the country 's highest military court to twelve years in prison . The navy and air force chiefs at the time received 14- and eight-year sentences . <P> Britons too were reminded of the war . In London the Defense Ministry confirmed that the May 4 , 1982 , sinking of the British destroyer Sheffield , and the death of 20 crew members , resulted from a bizarre coincidence . The ministry said that the Sheffield 's captain was on a communications hookup to naval headquarters at the precise moment an Argentine warplane fired an Exocet missile at the ship . The captain 's unfortunately timed call had jammed the destroyer 's radar system , allowing the craft to take a direct hit .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
