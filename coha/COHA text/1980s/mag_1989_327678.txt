American business leaders , who are eager to get Moscow 's ear on joint-venture ideas , think they have found just the way to do it . A group of companies led by Dwayne Andreas , chairman of the agricultural giant Archer Daniels Midland , wants to buy the partly completed U.S. embassy in Moscow and convert it to office space for American companies doing deals there . Construction on the $22 million , eight-story facility was halted in 1985 , when the U.S. discovered it was honeycombed with listening devices . If President Bush decides to pursue the proposal , he would have to persuade the Soviets to provide another site for the new embassy .
