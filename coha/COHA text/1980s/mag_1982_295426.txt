For this week 's complex picture of a troubled political system in the heat of a budget crisis , TIME focused on Congress and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker . To flesh out the picture , our Washington Bureau filed thousands of words to New York , where National Editor John Elson oversaw the project . Senior Writer Ed Magnuson handled the main story on Congress , and Associate Editor Walter Isaacson the portrait of Baker . Senior Congressional Correspondent Neil MacNeil , who has been covering the House and Senate for 33 years , and Correspondent Evan Thomas , who began his assignment on the Hill just last October after two years covering the Supreme Court and the Justice Department , teamed up to do the congressional reporting . <P> Says MacNeil , who joined TIME in 1958 after nine years with United Press : " Through two wars , recessions , recoveries , rascalities , occasional heroics , investigations , lobbyings , election campaigns and immense amounts of legislation , it has been a great experience , if only because of the extraordinary cast of characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , he did not need very long to get the general picture on the Hill . " On my old assignment , " he says , " it would take months to know anonymous Justice officials and court clerks well enough to get them to say much . On my new beat , there are 535 Congressmen and more than 20,000 staffers , and just about all of them like to talk to reporters . Nowhere is democracy more open than on Capitol Hill , though I 'm still trying to figure out whom to believe . " <P> For a cover image , TIME invited Senator Baker , an enthusiastic amateur photographer , to try his hand at a self-portrait . At first reluctant , Baker fell in with the idea after MacNeil mentioned some people who have had self-portraits on TIME 'S cover-including Marc Chagall , Thomas Hart Benton and James Thurber . " What company to be in ! " said Baker . TIME 'S Washington Bureau then dispatched Photographer Roddey Mims to Baker 's home town of Huntsville , Tenn. , to help set up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through twelve rolls of Kodak Ektachrome ASA-64 film in his 2-by-2 Hasselblad , while Mims backed him up with Kodachrome in his Nikon motordrive . As the shooting proceeded , Baker began to relax . " This is the most fun I have had in two months , " he told Mims . In the end , Robert Grossman 's airbrushed caricature beat out the Senator 's efforts for the cover . But readers can see one well-focused result of serious self-photography on page 16.
