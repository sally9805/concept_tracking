As the military prepares to bow out , bankruptcy menaces a dispirited nation <P> Just before he left the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington last week , Argentine Central Bank President Julio Gonzlez del Solar declared that his efforts to refinance his country 's $40 billion foreign debt had gone remarkably smoothly . " There is no nervousness , " he said . " Basically there is confidence . " <P> Gonzlez del Solar spoke too soon . Three days later , as the Harvard-trained official stepped off the Pan Am flight that had brought him back to Buenos Aires , three security men accosted him and abruptly hustled him off to a waiting car . They took Gonzlez del Solar to the headquarters of the mounted police , where they held him incommunicado overnight before flying him 1,700 miles south to the federal penitentiary in the desolate Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos . The reason : an obscure , nationalistic federal judge had summoned Gonzlez del Solar , whose position is roughly comparable to that of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a routine clause that gives an American court jurisdiction in any dispute over loans to Argentina signed in the U.S. With those Keystone Kops antics , Judge Federico Pinto Kramer pushed Argentina to the brink of international default . Foreign banks immediately suspended all payments of new loans to Argentina , raising fears of a collapse that could set off a global chain reaction . <P> The crisis could hardly have struck at a worse moment . Argentines were in the midst of an election campaign that holds the promise of ending 7 years of incompetent and sometimes murderous military rule . Still humiliated by last year 's defeat by Britain in the Falkland Islands and burdened by triple-digit inflation and 15% unemployment , the military government of President Reynaldo Bignone was rapidly losing what little control it still had . As if to underscore the government 's impotence , the country 's two largest labor unions called a 24-hour national strike that shut down virtually all factories and public services . The prevailing attitude , warned the Buenos Aires newspaper La Nacin , " is something like collective suicide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed . " The situation became so precarious , indeed , that some Argentines wondered if the election scheduled for Oct. 30 would even take place . <P> The country 's close encounter with insolvency began when a lawyer in Rio Gallegos formally objected to a standard clause in a debt agreement between the national airline , Aerolineas Argentinas , and U.S. creditor banks . The provision stipulates that any litigation can take place in the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York as well as in Argentina . Judge Pinto Kramer agreed that the clause probably violated Argentine sovereignty . Using the broad powers that federal judges in Argentina enjoy , Pinto Kramer decreed a freeze on all loan negotiations , then ordered the arrest of Gonzlez del Solar .
