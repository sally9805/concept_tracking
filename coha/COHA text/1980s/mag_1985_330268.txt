For decades the well-respected family in the picturesque Bavarian town of Gunzburg had kept the secret , much as Sicilian clans honor omerta , the code of silence . Stories about searches for and sightings of the Auschwitz death doctor had come and gone , but the Mengeles of Gunzburg said nothing , never offering so much as a sliver of information about Josef Mengele 's possible fate to the West German investigators assigned to the case . " Not once , " said - Hans-Eberhard Klein , the federal prosecutor who has handled the West German part of the probe since 1974 . " Never . " <P> Last week , as forensic experts in Brazil worked to determine whether the bones unearthed at Embu were those of Josef Mengele , the family 's dam of silence crumbled . In announcing his father 's death in a 100-word statement , Rolf Mengele , 41 , briefly expressed " profound sympathy " to concentration- camp victims and their families . A few days later Rolf , with the family 's consent , turned over to the West German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depict his father 's 36 years on the run . At the same time , Dieter Mengele , one of Josef 's nephews , told an Augsburg newspaper that the family had kept silent because " we did not want to risk the necks " of people linked to the hunted man . <P> Until last week no Mengele had publicly expressed an iota of remorse for the doctor 's activities or cooperated with the West German inquiry . The family 's aloofness and secrecy had convinced some of the frustrated West German investigators that the clan bore no sense of shame or sorrow for Josef 's wartime crimes . The lack of cooperation was a major drawback for the probers , since West German law does not require family members to aid in any investigation of their kin , no matter how distant the relationship . <P> Even as Rolf and Dieter finally spoke out , attempts last week to question other Mengeles proved unsuccessful . In Gunzburg ( pop . 19,000 ) , the town where most of the clan resides , family members were " not available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl Mengele &; Sons , the family-run farm-machinery and hydraulic-press concern that is Gunzburg 's largest employer . In Munich , 120 miles to the southeast , some Mengele relatives were so wary of newsmen that they took nameplates off their doorbells . <P> Nonetheless , the Mengeles seemed certain to retain the loyalty of many of Gunzburg 's citizens , in large measure because of local pride in and reliance on the Mengele firm . The company was founded in 1907 by Karl Mengele , Josef 's father and the man to whom the family 's passion for privacy and self-reliance can be traced . During his military service in World War I , the elder Mengele left his wife in charge of his business , establishing a tradition of keeping the firm securely in family hands . <P> Karl Mengele &; Sons now has a payroll of 1,200 ; 1984 revenues amounted to $82 million . The firm is run by Dieter Mengele and his cousin Karl-Heinz and is considered a fair employer and a generous civic donor . According to local police , the Mengeles have never reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs saying MENGELE-GUNZBURG dot the sides of roads in the vicinity of the town ; the firm 's slogan , MENGELE  --  THE BETTER IDEA , is splashed across the side of a plant building , clearly visible to motorists passing on a nearby expressway .
