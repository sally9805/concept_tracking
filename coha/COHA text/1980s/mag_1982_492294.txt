At dawn , the sun came up like a fiery ball over the rolling ridges of the Appalachians . On a parking bluff set above and back from the main lot of the airport-hotel near Pittsburgh were the Ford company " secrets " : four new 1983 cars , sitting there some 150 days before they would be unveiled to the world . Three , maybe four or five years ago , these cars were little more than a collection of ideas and drawings being fought over and penciled through the offices of the Design Center of the Ford Motor Company . Since then , the car designs had gone through every examination , from wind-tunnel tests of new " aerodynamic " flow to rattle tests of the sun-roof latch to endless bumpy-road tests of the new shock-absorber system . On this day , five months before their official debut , they would undergo one of the final tests  --  the Chief Engineer 's Sign-Off Trip . The test would involve hundreds of miles of cross-country driving on every kind of road and route from farm roads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea was to put these prototypes , as the leaders in a new generation of Ford cars-to-come , through the kinds of tests that owners would . There were certain tests that had to be passed . One was that of the new shock-absorber system . The other , that of gas consumption ; these cars had to be better in miles-per-gallon than the 1982 LTDs  --  anything less would not be tolerated . To see how well they met these tests , and to test-drive the cars themselves , The Saturday Evening Post was invited along in an exclusive preview of what this new generation of LTDs and Marquis might offer . As it turned out , this provided not only an insight into the cars themselves but into the processes by which one large automaker makes sure that the new models meet the owners ' expectations . There was another kind of car generation along on the trip  --  the human kind . He represents the upcoming generation of automobile leadership  --  easy , not pushy , a quiet man , given more to small smiles than raucous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the gift of being likable without trying to be . His name is Edsel Ford . " Oh , " gurgled a female desk clerk when he checked into a hotel near Pittsburgh , " how interesting of your parents to name you after a couple of cars ! " That 's not quite the way it happened . Edsel came before the Edsel car just as the Ford family came before the Ford car . This Edsel is Edsel II . But he will be the fourth Ford in direct line from Henry I to head the company . At the age of 33 , Edsel II is not only the heir apparent to the company leadership but the symbol of a regeneration in people going on at Ford Motor Company . There have been many changes and upheavals in the last few years , not the least of which was the surprising retirement of his own father , Henry II . Those changes not only brought new top management and new design management to Ford but also an attitude towards a leaner system ( and cost ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost avantgard . Literally billions of dollars are expected to be saved in the new production systems ; the new generation in car design is being shaped and honed to match those savings with customer appeal . Edsel Ford II has spent these last few years exploring a variety of corporate experiences and company responsibilities . He 's been in Product Planning , in Strategy , in Marketing , in cars , in trucks , in Australia , in Boston , in Los Angeles , in Detroit . On this particular day of the testing of the 1983 LTDs and Marquis , he was the only nonengineer studying the prototypes. " .. . we will drive 348 miles in a total of 10 hours , from here to Dearborn , " said Bob Harrison on the bluff near Pittsburgh . He is a direct , intense man , the trip leader and principal engineer for vehicle development . He 'd supervised moving the prototypes ( along with two 1982 models that would serve as " comparison cars " ) from the Ford division headquarters in Dearborn , Michigan , to Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers who 'd made that particular trip had already flown home to write and file their reports . This trip would involve a different set of engineers who 'd file a different set of reports . " We 'll have 11 driver changes at intervals of about 30 miles or so , " said Bob Harrison . He examined a large notebook that recorded just who would be in what car each segment of the journey , then glanced at his watch . It was 7:30 a.m . " Okay , " he said , " time to move out . " The trip leader was in a station wagon . It had no number in the motorcade ; every other car had a number from 1 through 6 . " We 've got two mechanics , the trip leader , a lot of tools and some spare tires in that station wagon , " said Stuart Frey , vice president for car engineering and planning for Ford 's North American operations . He was " my " driver . When we all switched cars every 40 to 45 minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford II . One thing was assumed from the start : These prototypes would be made as near to perfect as possible when the car went into production . But only a measured number of all the changes coming up in the new generation of Fords could be seen in these cars . Instead , the changes would be introduced year by year , right up to 1990 , in one model one year , in another another year . The first foul-up discovered was not in a change . It was in a common piece of " old " equipment : The chimes that signal that the car door is open with the key still in the ignition would not quit in car 1 , Frey 's car . Even with the door closed . " Now that , " said Frey , " can get a trifle aggravating . " That , as it developed , was the one delay due to mechanical breakdown , however small . However , the engineers looked for many factors that rarely even make an impact on the owner 's consciousness . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , Stuart Frey moved the car back and forth in his lane , looking for the " tire paths , " the strips on the pavement where millions of tires rolling over that highway through the years had carved a perceptible track . By shifting the car back and forth between them , he could get the kind of tires-on-the-road contrast that would tell him much about the degree of roughness and of sound that was being transmitted through the prototype to the driver and his passenger . " We 'll know by the end of today 's drive if we have to do anything more to kill the sound and the feel of the uneven road , " he said . With all the years of design and testing , such as these prototypes experience , costs mount steeply . Each prototype costs , so far , " about $250,000 , " observed Stuart Frey . When any flaw was discovered in them , they were torn down and examined and the flaw corrected before the car was tested again . " Does this car feel any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from a roadside stop after a driver change . I tested the play in the wheel , glanced around at the sight lines  --  front , side and back  --  and gave a gentle jab to the accelerator . " No , " I replied . " Should it ? " He answered with another question . " Does it seem larger or smaller than the other cars we 've been driving ? " I glanced around . This was a four-door , walnut-colored car that had the same style-lines as the other prototypes . " Well , since you ask , " I said tentatively , " it must be smaller . " He offered his small smile . " Not at all . It 's exactly the same size on the inside as the last car you were driving . This is a four-cylinder car " ? not a six-cylinder model as were the other I , TDs and Marquis . He 'd wondered whether it was so obviously a four-cylinder car that I would have a reaction to it ; would it feel smaller than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got into it and began driving it just as most customers would . Edsel had encountered a more skeptical test-driver for the four-cylinder car than he might have anticipated . My five-year-old Fairmont station wagon at home is a four-cylinder Ford , and its performance does not overwhelmingly recommend repeat purchase . " Let 's see how long it takes to catch up to the car in front , " I said . I gave the accelerator an easy nudge and felt a steady pickup but , I explained , no big kick . " Does that mean a lot to you ? " asked Edsel . I explained that I 'd driven a Thunderbird before the Fairmont and that it had the kind of kick on the open road that gave the driver all kinds of assurances . Edsel was genuinely interested . Why would a person out of his teens be looking for a kick ? " Because you like to know the engine 's on your side , that it 's got reserve power  --  that it 's there when you need it , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're looking for a little farther down on the pedal , " he suggested . He was right . I 'd been treating the car too gently . When I came down hard on the accelerator , the car picked up  --  not with the kick of a Thunderbird , of course , but with enough spirit to begin overtaking the lead cars , steadily , if not spectacularly . " I can live with this car , " I thought . It had another quality , too : the aerodynamic look of the new generation of Ford cars . For a long while , American cars had been moving to a chopped-off look . They developed square grilles and short , blunt rear ends . It was an attempt not only to be smaller but to look smaller in a more muscular way . Now Ford is among those companies that are relieving the hard , square lines somewhat . It is introducing more of an aerodynamic line into the body design of the car . That means slanting the front grille somewhat from the harder vertical line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is more slanted now and has a turned-up line at the trunk-lid so that the air-flow is not in a whirling vortex towards the ground but isswept up in the air behind the car . All this reflects the focus of Ford in its new generation of cars . For Ford is deeply committed to improved " aerodynamics " ? to what Ford executives call " total vehicle air-flow movement . " Ford has already turned out a hand-produced aerodynamic design of the " car of 1990 , " called " Concept 90 . " But reaching that goal is a gradual process . Most of the car-buying public resists a radical year-to-year change in the design of its cars . Therefore , only the start towards streamlining will be apparent in the 1983 cars , becoming a trifle more pronounced in the cars of 1984 and 1985 . Westward across Ohio , from the low Appalachians on the eastern border to the beckoning land beyond , the rolling hills gentle down to the flat plains and small farms of the great American Middle West . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply go faster on flat roads than on hilly ones . But if they are to keep the car behind in sight  --  and in mind  --  they must be ready to use the brake pedal as willingly as the accelerator . " Try moving your foot from the accelerator to the brake , " suggested Edsel on one leg of the trip . He was not concerned so much about reducing speed . He was concerned about how I felt for  --  and about  --  the brake . I made the move from one pedal to the other . Nothing unusual in it , I thought . But there was . " You had to lift your foot to hit the brake pedal , " said Edsel . He was , of course , quite correct . The brake pedal was set slightly higher than the accelerator pedal when all pressure was taken off the latter . The two pedals were not even . It was not a problem that inspired militancy so much as thoughtful consideration . " I think I 'll have to take a look into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Edsel Ford . He is as much like the rest of us as a man can be who wears one of the most famous names in the world and who shares both the future and the responsibilities of that name . He seems guarded at times . That is understandable . He does not have the overheated personality that isanxious for fame , for celebrity , for the kind of notoriety that inevitably attaches itself to " a famous name . " He has the nose and the facial bone structure of his great-grandfather , Henry Ford , though he does not communicate the sinewy astringency of " The Progenitor . " He also has some of his father 's perspective  --  to see life in its totality instead of only in its automotive angles . This is not to say that he does not remember events at Ford that were somehow significant in the lives of others . He can recall , for example , the excitement that surrounded the introduction of the Ford convertible of the late 1950s  --  the convertible that had a metal roof that folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the rear seat . He remembers also the excitement that surrounded a Ford car of a later year . It was the year of Edsel 's 16th birthday , and his father gave him what every teenager dreamed of : a Mustang . For that was the year the Mustang was born , and an entire generation immediately identified with the new , sporty little car . It is this unjaded attitude , this genuineness of response , that inspires a warm feeling toward Edsel Ford . He has not been separated from the spontaneous , common experiences of life by great wealth and a great name . In a sense , though , Edsel is never totally privileged to be " offstage " when he is at work . There is no way he can totally escape the knowledge of his coworkers of who he is and what he will yet be . Yet the engineers on this trip accepted him as just another guy trying to do his job  --  though his job is totally unlike their own . He , in turn , recognizes not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates a kind of continuing excitement for marketing men . " We 're running about an hour late , " said trip leader Bob Harrison at the lunch break . He warned that there would n't be a leisurely coffee stop in the afternoon and that driver changes would be swift and purposeful with no more time allowed for casual conversation . The fuel tanks were filled by the mechanics while the drivers filled themselves with food , so there 'd be no need for an afternoon fuel stop . The " freshness " of the test run had worn off . Thus the trip was growing valuable in the irritations it produced . The savvy owners would be as sensitive to every nagging irritation as Ford 's development engineers , who expect perfection . The question is where perfection differs from personal preference . It is Edsel Ford 's responsibility to be sensitive to that problem . And what would he buy ? Given the choice , Edsel leans to the LTD/Marquis family instead of reflexively getting the biggest possible Lincoln . To many people , it is a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have unlimited spending money , that they must live on budgets , just like everybody else . Of course , the budgets are bigger . But they do n't permit acquiring every car an individual might want . Edsel gets the use of a company car , just as do many other Ford executives . Like other Ford executives , he uses one company car for six months , then turns it back to the company and gets a different company car . In that way , he has a chance  --  as a marketing man  --  to get to know intimately two different models every year . For family use , he leases another car every year ; he must pay for it out of his own pocket . If he wants or needs another car , he might lease that , too . If he wants yet another car , he just ca n't grab one off the production line . He 'd have to go out and buy it . At least he 'd know the base price of the car when he starts to bargain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side entrance of a restaurant . There 's a restroom just inside that entrance . " The caravan was still behind schedule , but the trip leader was determined that all the requirements of the test run and of the driving schedule would be met . " There will be no time for coffee , " he reiterated . To the uninitiated , it would seem that northern Ohio and the Detroit , Michigan , area would be a " danger zone " for those seeking to keep new-car designs a secret . In fact , only a few people we encountered on the road seemed to recognize anything significantly different as the test run rolled on . The Ford engineers have , in fact , given up worrying about whether anybody will spot the new-model Fords long before they hit the showrooms . It is their conviction that the test runs are more valuable than trying to keep the design a secret . " You just ca n't keep the cars under wraps forever when you 're building this many prototypes and want to test them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Ford involve not what the model looks like , but what the financial structure of the company looks like in these difficult days . The Ford Motor Company lost a total of $2.6 billion in 1980 and 1981 . It began meeting the problem before the depressing numbers were in : It cut its annual costs by $2.5 billion between 1979 and 1981 , and it was seeking to cut another billion dollars in 1982 . All of this is important to Edsel Ford , to Ford Motor Company and , indeed , to the whole auto industry . For it points the way to economy  --  and survival . In 1980 , Ford had to sell 3.7 million cars and trucks to break even on its U.S. operations . This year , it could break even with sales of three million units , or about 19 percent fewer than in 1980 . The process of shaping hard deadlines based on hard information is an important part of that improvement , which is why this test run is so important . " Heading for home now , " said Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowding of the evening rush hour on the outskirts of Detroit was breaking it into segments , and the drivers felt less need to keep in contact with the car up front and the car behind . " We 'll meet for a debriefing in the Experimental Garage in Dearborn , " said Harrison . We eased off the interstate near Detroit and soon were cruising down the broad avenues of Dearborn , Michigan , with Edsel delivering a travelogue . " That 's the ' Rouge ' " - once the pulsing center of the vast Ford manufacturing empire . " And there 's the Dearborn Inn ... the first airport hotel in the country " ? there used to be an airport across the road from it where the sturdy old Ford trimotors were flown out after manufacture . At 5:25 p.m. , we swung into the Experimental Garage , past pieces of cars that had been " tested to destruction , " past a variety of new models , past a vehicle that looked very much like the once super-secret Concept 90 . The trip was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task was to fill out the basic trip report  --  a yellow chart about the size of notebook paper that asked for a rating of all six cars in 51 different categories . Then there was the debriefing , which would start literally in moments . And after that , there 'd be the long , scrupulous examination of the cars and of everything that happened to them on the test run . The easiest and most compelling statistic that many people looked at was gas consumption . It was measured for all six test cars for the entire trip  --  for the run from Dearborn to Pittsburgh as well as the cross-country trip back to Dearborn . That was a total of 700 miles over two days of driving , with at least a dozen different people at the wheel of each car on roads of almost every possible kind . Thus , whatever emerged as the gas consumption was not carefully sculpted from special tests designed to raise the figure . It was something real , rather than something hand-tooled to attract potential buyers . All of the 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test run . One did 5.7 miles per gallon better than the best 1982 car . The smallest and the biggest of the 1983 prototype engines turned in the best gas-consumption figures . The smallest was , of course , the 4-cylinder LTD ; it came in at a figure of 25.3 miles per gallon . The biggest was the top-of-the-line Marquis ; it came in at a figure of 24.8 miles per gallon . The information gathered on this trip has already been formulated into the decision-making process at Ford . The designs of these cars have been hardened and turned over to the production people . The 1983 LTDs are expected to be unveiled to the public early in October . The engineers are looking forward to the start of production as much as the buy ing public . " We 'll take 10 of the first 100 or 150 cars at random off the production line to see if they 're meeting all our expectations , " said Frey . This is not really a test of design or the engineering ; that is all over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars in production  --  whether they are literally what the designers and engineers expected them to be and , if not , how the quality of the car can be raised . " Then we 'll take 50 cars off the next production run of several hundred cars or so and test them again , to make sure they 're doing what we expect them to do . " The process goes on and on as Ford , like other U.S. car-makers , seeks to make certain that the 1983 models they will put on the showroom floors meet all expectations  --  their own and the buyers ' . The substance in all this is the interrelated aspects of change  --  change in design , change in economics of the company , change in the leadership of the industry , each resting on the other and all coming together as a whole . Edsel Ford is deeply involved in that substance , personally and symbolically . He is the symbol of the changes taking place all through Ford Motor Company , of the new generation of men and machines that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end something about the success of the new generation of LTDs . We 'll all know by decade 's end something about the evolving success  --  or failure  --  of the new generation of automobile leadership . This reflects the difference in measuring men and machines : The tests of the LTD and other models are brief , while the tests of Edsel Ford will go on through history .
