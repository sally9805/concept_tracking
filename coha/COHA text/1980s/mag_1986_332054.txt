Two young men , an American and a Latin American , have been jailed by the police of an unnamed country 's rightist dictatorship . The crime : distribution of subversive leaflets . In their cell , they converse clumsily , united less by ideology than by a rapturous and surprisingly sophisticated passion for literature . Yet at every turn they misunderstand each other , responding to received images from each other 's popular culture rather than to the actual person across the room . The American is a wandering would-be writer . He cheerily acknowledges that he knows no Spanish and thus has not even read the flyers they handed out . It hardly matters , he explains , because he knew what was meant  --  sort of . In fact , his politics are so ill formed , so much a product of simple adolescent rebellion , that he might have endorsed any radical cause . His alternately amused and annoyed companion is , it turns out , the author of the leaflets , an Oxbridge-educated scion of a prominent family who has joined the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country does not feel like home . Even so , he felt honor bound to come back and fight . <P> That encounter , which leads to brutal police beatings for both , takes place in 1970 . Fifteen years later , the men meet again , this time at a diplomatic session between the same country 's newly installed left-wing dictatorship and an international human rights group . The visitors are pleading for the release of an imprisoned poet who had served the former right-wing regime as its Ambassador to Spain . The air is abuzz with debate about the competing political and aesthetic duties of the writer , the distinction between artistic merit and moral virtue and the uneasy relations between the industrial nations and the emerging Third World , where freedom and tolerance are often viewed as unaffordable luxuries . <P> These two acts make up Principia Scriptoriae , a passionate , enlightened and altogether admirable play by Richard Nelson . Now being performed off-Broadway , it has been accorded a rare honor for an American play : Britain 's Royal Shakespeare Company will produce it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latinate reference to the rules for sound literary construction and the morals that artists ought to live by . Yet Nelson focuses on two characters who are not artists , merely intelligent men . The narrative is less concerned with the fate of the poet than with their enduring misunderstanding and mistrust . <P> The American ( Anthony Heald ) has failed to sort out the conflicting impulses of his roles as observer , returning revolutionary , reunited friend and working journalist . His former cellmate ( Joe Urla ) pecks away at poetry but works primarily for a malign , fanatical government minister . In rich and subtle performances , the opponents lacerate each other with unwelcome truths as they strive to rekindle affection . Then , in a finely calibrated and powerful final scene that shifts back to 1970 , at what the two believed would be the hour of their death , Nelson makes their antagonism all the sadder . As they quake , bound and blindfolded in terror , " hugging " by pressing their backs together , he shows how simple and intense their devotion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comprehend .
