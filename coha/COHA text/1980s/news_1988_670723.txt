The discovery answered one question : What happened to Mrs. Fioretti ? But not another : Who killed her ? // The death has become the focus of an unusual murder investigation . The Bronx District Attorney ' s office has named her estranged husband Robert Fioretti , a former New York City police officer , as a suspect . But it has done so without physical evidence linking him to the crime and it has not arrested him. // A lawyer for Mr. Fioretti has said that the accusation is outrageous and that press inquiries , which he generally declines to answer , only force his client into the impossible task of trying to prove a negative - that is , that he did not kill Mrs. Fioretti. // The District Attorney , Paul T. Gentile , acknowledged that the evidence in the case thus far is circumstantial , but said he was justified in calling Mr. Fioretti the prime suspect . Prosecutors get closer to indicting him every day , he said. // " This is why there ' s no statute of limitations to murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand jury investigates the case , Mr. Fioretti is living in his old house on City Island , which , after a year on Long Island , he moved back into eight days after Mrs. Fioretti disappeared . He brought with him a trailer of possessions and his former patrol partner , who was pregnant with their child at the time and whom he married a month later . He began looking after the two children from his first marriage , who needed a parent after their mother disappeared. // Hours after Mrs. Fioretti failed to show up for a business meeting on Aug. 10 , 1986 , her employer , the International Paper Co. in Manhattan , began asking after her . When authorities reached Mr. Fioretti on Long Island a few days later , police reports at the time said , he told them that his estranged wife was an alcoholic who had run away with other men before and that there was no reason to be very concerned about her. // Neighbors on City Island , her former colleagues at work and her closest living relative all dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-year-old child like that , " said Evelyn McCurdy , Mrs. Fioretti ' s step-sister , who was interviewed by telephone at her home in Baltimore . " Rita was a very sweet , very dedicated mother , very responsible , " said a neighbor . " She never let those children out of her sight . " Mrs. Fioretti had two sons , Robert Jr. , who was 14 at the time and Steven , who was 3. // Barely a week after she disappeared , Mr. Fioretti moved in to the City Island house with his former patrol partner , Maureen Brooks , an officer in the 113th precinct in Queens . In September 1986 he married her , and two months later she gave birth to their daughter . <> <> Obtained Secret Divorce // Whether his marriage to Ms. Brooks was legal - given that Mrs. Fioretti was not officially dead at the time - is open to question . In a Brooklyn court in 1974 , Mr. Fioretti obtained a divorce from Mrs. Fioretti , which Bronx prosecutors say was fraudulent because he used a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers had been served on his wife . By all accounts , Mrs. Fioretti never knew of the divorce , and the couple continued to live together for nearly 10 years , during which she gave birth to a second son . Mr. Fioretti ' s reason for obtaining the secret divorce remains unclear. // By the end of the year , authorities began to say that , while Mrs. Fioretti was still officially missing , she was presumed dead. // In January 1987 , Mr. Fioretti was indicted on a charge of stealing $17 , 617. 74 from her bank account , and he was dismissed from the police for refusing to answer questions about the charges . According to prosecutors , two months after the disappearance , he forged a withdrawal slip in an attempt to transfer the money from an account held by Mrs. Fioretti to one that he shared with Ms. Brooks . He was also charged with filing false tax and medical-insurance forms in which he had claimed Mrs. Fioretti as a dependent . <> <> ' Didn ' t Do It in Bronx ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge who did so , John P. Collins of State Supreme Court , did not comment on the substance of the charges , but said that because the alleged withdrawal occurred in Nassau County and the forms were compiled by an accountant in Westchester , Mr. Fioretti could not be tried in the Bronx. // " Whatever they think he did , which they have yet to prove , he didn ' t do it in the Bronx , if he did it at all , " Mr. Fioretti ' s attorney , David M. Richman , said at the time. // Prosecutors in Westchester and Nassau are reviewing the cases now , but are not expected to act until it becomes clear whether charges will be made in Mrs. Fioretti ' s killing. // Late one afternoon last month , Mr. Gentile called reporters to his office and made a dramatic announcement : Mrs. Fioretti ' s body had been found . He said investigators had matched Xx-rays of the body , which had lain unidentified in a city morgue for five months , to medical records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for well over a year , and apparently washed ashore when it came loose from weights that held it down . <> <> Sample of Brother ' s Hair // The medical examiner ' s office issued a death certificate , and Mr. Gentile said prosecutors could officially proceed with a murder investigation. // But no murder charges appear imminent. // There have been other unusual actions in the case. // Prosecutors have also asked a judge to allow them to take hair samples from Mr. Fioretti ' s brother , Alan Fioretti , who lives in New Jersey . Although they have not said he is a suspect , They said they wanted to determine whether two hairs found in the trash bag containing Mrs. Fioretti ' s dismembered body were consistent with his hair. // Alan Fioretti ' s lawyer , David Bernheim , called the request unjustified. // Robert Fioretti ' s lawyer , Mr. Richman , said his client was " angry and confused " about media coverage , he said , and " does feel a sense of loss. " // " There is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Richman added . " I can only tell you that he has no responsibility here . He had nothing to do whatsoever with the disappearance.
