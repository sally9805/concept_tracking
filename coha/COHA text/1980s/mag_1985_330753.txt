Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger , who once aspired to be Secretary of ( State , often tries to put his own spin on foreign policy . Last week he was at it again , waging a rearguard action against accommodation with the Soviet Union . <P> His verbal war on Moscow started with a television interview in which he spoke indignantly , but inaccurately , about an encounter between U.S. and Soviet soldiers in East Germany . On Sept. 8 , he said , a Soviet truck " deliberately " bumped an American patrol car . Then the Soviets held a G.I. for nine hours , treating him roughly . The Soviets " generally behaved in the same way that they did in the incident in which Major ( Arthur ) Nicholson was killed , " Weinberger said , recalling the shooting of an American liaison officer by a Soviet sentry in East Germany on March 24 . <P> In fact , two Americans were improperly detained this time after their car became entangled in barbed wire . But they were released without harm when a Soviet officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toned down his account . A senior American officer in West Germany told TIME , " It was not a hostile situation and involved rather reasonable behavior on both sides . " <P> At midweek , Weinberger and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle appeared in the Pentagon briefing room . They stood before an array of charts and photographs , including ones of Leonid Smirnov , director of the Soviet Military Industrial Commission , and KGB Boss Victor Chebrikov . The rogues ' gallery provided an atmospheric backdrop for distribution of a 34-page study on how the Soviets have advanced 5,000 of their research projects with technical information bought , stolen or acquired legally in the West . <P> The new report added fresh detail about Moscow 's global intelligence vacuum cleaner . For instance , espionage allowed the Soviets to copy the " look-down , shoot-down " radar capability of the F-18 , saving an estimated five years and $55 million in research . Moscow also pirated the design for a computer used in cruise missiles . But the Pentagon study itself pointed out that about 90% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weinberger proposed no new statutes or regulations to reduce the haul . <P> He partly remedied that next day at a press conference , where he suggested fewer Soviets be allowed in the West . " We have to bear in mind , " he said , " that the Soviets do n't send people to countries like the U.S. unless they are fully equipped , fully trained and either part of the KGB or might just as well be . " Weinberger endorsed Perle 's view that the number of Soviet officials in the U.S. should be no greater than the number of Americans in the U.S.S.R. ( Right now the Soviets have nearly four times as many , 980 to 260 . ) Weinberger also defended the crux of his initial statement on the East German incident and repeated his opposition to any U.S. concessions in arms- control negotiations . In giving Nicholson a posthumous promotion , Weinberger said the Soviets ' " ruthlessness " should be a warning for anyone " willing to give ( them ) the benefit of the doubt .
