Lieut . Colonel Gregorio ( " Gringo " ) Honasan is a master at manipulating military frustration . Last August thousands of underpaid soldiers joined him in an uprising that nearly toppled Philippine President Corazon Aquino . Last week Honasan apparently took advantage of unrest in the armed forces again . With the help of a reserve lieutenant said to be angry because he had not received a regular commission , Honasan escaped from a navy ship on Manila Bay , where he had been detained since his capture last December . Escaping with him on two rubber rafts were 13 of his guards . It took the government four months to capture Gringo after his failed coup , a time filled with destabilizing rumors of the Aquino regime 's imminent collapse . <P> Earlier in the week Aquino had received some very good news . In a major raid in a suburb of Manila , soldiers rounded up five top Communist insurgents , including Romulo ( " Rolly " ) Kintanar , the commander of the 25,000-member New People 's Army , and Rafael Baylosis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the single largest roundup of Communist rebels since Aquino came to power in 1986 , and could create a crippling power vacuum within the N.P.A.  --  at least for a while .
