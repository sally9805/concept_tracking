The state 's ruling on biology texts has national implications <P> When Texas talks , textbook publishers tend to listen . As one of the largest purchasers of school textbooks ( $65 million this year ) , the state has regularly exerted a strong influence on the content of books used by schools across the country . After the Texas board of education accommodated Fundamentalist Christians in 1974 by requiring that evolution be taught as " only one of several explanations " of the origins of mankind , some publishers began to alter their texts to make them more widely acceptable . For instance , in the 1981 high school biology book published by Laidlaw Bros. , a division of Doubleday , the word evolution did not appear , even in the glossary or index . <P> In 1982 the People for the American Way , a liberal group that wages First Amendment campaigns , began pressuring the Texas board to rescind its 1974 rule . They were joined last month by a powerful ally : Texas State Attorney General Jim Mattox concluded that the rule was unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities rather than a dedication to scientific truth . " Two weeks ago the Texas board of education repealed the controversial measure . Said American Way Coordinator Michael Hudson : " This is going to free publishers to write about science accurately , unhampered by religious dogma . It undoes ten years of creationist influence on textbook content , and it will spill over into every state . " <P> Interpreting the Texas decision as a triumph of Darwinists over creationists misses the main point . What the struggle shows is the important role that textbooks can play in the nationwide drive to restore educational excellence . The reversal comes at a time when Computer Magnate H. Ross Perot , as chairman of a committee on public education , is crusading to upgrade Texas schools . Holt , Rinehart &; Winston 's Robert Palmerton calls the decision " a plus for the state of Texas . " <P> Some critics have charged that textbook adoption procedures like those in Texas have resulted in a general watering-down of the content of science texts , which in turn has contributed to a decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yager , past president of the National Science Teachers Association , 90% of all science teachers use a textbook 90% of the time . Florida Governor Robert Graham , a leader in school reform , has observed , " States have upgraded requirements for graduation , raised teachers ' salaries and enacted a variety of reforms . Parallel with these reforms must be a serious uplifting of the quality of textbooks . " Most publishers maintain that big buyers , like Texas , do not influence their books . But analysts have noted that texts have been made less rigorous because teachers and students demanded easier books .
