Defense Costs <P> To the Editors : <P> Your analysis of defense spending was welcome March 7 . It is unfortunate that we have to waste so much of our resources on defense . By using those resources unwisely we will ultimately destroy confidence in our Government . <P> William G. Smith Victorville , Calif . <P> The Franklin Spinneys of this world are the type that President Reagan has asked us to emulate : honest , forthright and fiscally conservative . Yet the Reagan Administration tries to curb Government growth but encourages defense spending . Welfare is deplored , but military and industrial pork barrels are filled to the brim . It does not make sense . <P> Ross L. Sargent Visalia , Calif . <P> Your story on defense spending scared me . How can there be such disparity of opinion in the Pentagon ? Someone is not telling the truth . The Department of Defense was created to promote unity among the services . Secretary of Defense Weinberger should tell the armed forces to get with it . <P> Donald G. Johnson Bar Hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 56,000 American soldiers who gave their lives in Viet Nam . They were members of the most sophisticated and technically advanced army in the world . Their enemy wore uniforms that looked like pajamas , and shoes made from discarded tires . The Vietnamese carried their firepower on their backs . Their arms , a conglomeration of captured and handmade weapons , held the U.S. at bay for ten years . <P> Paul M. Sullivan , Viet Nam vet Selden , N. Y. <P> If funds for military personnel are cut , who will operate the high-tech weapons systems ? The legislators who drew up the defense budget fail to recognize that the military 's most valuable asset is its people , not its weapons . <P> Gregory L. Davies Ensign , U.S.N. Athens , Ga . <P> The examples of defense spending cited in your story lead me to believe that a heftier military budget does not ensure a more effective one . <P> Cary Brazeman Atlanta <P> Franklin Spinney 's briefing is frightening . Yet devotees of high technology are absolutely convinced , despite historical evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of readiness and a shortage of men and basic materiel . <P> Austin E. Miller Springfield , Va . <P> Franklin Spinney was talking about history , not about our current situation . The day before Spinney made his presentation , the Army Chief of Staff testified that cost overruns have been cut to one-tenth of 1% . In addition , Spinney overlooked the savings that were made in last year 's budget by the Armed Services Committee . He ignored the fact that the real cost increases last year and in the years to come were caused by the combined actions of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee , neither of which is known for expertise in arms . <P> You have given substance and credence to this young man 's work , which , while thorough , applies to the 1970s . Spinney did not shed any light on the problems that we face today in getting this country prepared . <P> Barry Goldwater U.S. Senator , Arizona Washington , D.C.                  @ @ @
