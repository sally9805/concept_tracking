Herman Kahn : 1922-1983 <P> From a mind that was at once brooding and sparkling , eclectic and intense , ideas poured forth that were able to shock a nation and yet influence its policies . Treating nuclear war as unthinkable , he said , made it all the more probable , and the U.S. must prepare to survive one . He predicted the boom of Japan 's economy well before the Datsun invasion ; more recently he warned of problems that lie ahead for that island nation . For the U.S. , he saw a new golden age during the next two decades marked by disappearing poverty , an upsurge of productivity and an abundance of resources . Even his book titles- Thinking About the Unthinkable ( 1962 ) , The Japanese Challenge ( 1979 ) , The Coming Boom ( 1982 ) - were destined to pass into the lexicon of policy debates . <P> Herman Kahn , who died last week at his home in Chappaqua , N.Y. , of a heart attack at 61 , was a mathematician , physicist , economist , weapons analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sedate world of ideas , a futurist who attempted , in his own words , " to cope with history before it happens . " He was a pioneer in using scientific and mathematical tools to project the future . With his 300-lb. bulk and a florid face framed by a tailored white beard , Kahn had a commanding presence that seemed to complement a mental and verbal vigor bordering on arrogance . He briefed , and at times berated , every President starting with Harry Truman , and at his first hour-long meeting with Ronald Reagan in 1981 , he permitted the new President to get in only a few words . " The main thing we do is change attitudes , " Kahn told TIME Correspondent Joelle Attinger shortly before his death . " We 're trying to educate policymakers . " <P> Kahn was born in Bayonne , N.J. , graduated from U.C.L.A. in 1945 and three years later joined the Rand Corp. , the California think tank that helps the Pentagon develop defense strategies . He rejected the prevailing nuclear doctrine , Mutual Assured Destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will deter the use of such weapons . Instead , he urged preparation for fighting limited nuclear wars . <P> In 1961 Kahn left Rand to help form his own think tank , the Hudson Institute , on bucolic acreage north of New York City . He kept his umbilical cord of contracts with the Pentagon ; approximately half of the institute 's $3.6 million annual budget comes from Government contracts . But he also branched out to ponder other societal problems . Among the studies being pursued : prospects for electronic transmission of mail , ways to win a war in El Salvador , alternatives to the federal income tax , the strength of the Soviet navy . On a typical day , Kahn moved from seminars to informal discussions spouting such iconoclastic judgments as " The nuclear freeze is immoral " and " The welfare economy is the last refuge of the scoundrel . " Such orotund pronouncements often infuriated critics , who charged that Kahn was more interested in glib provocation than reflective analysis .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
