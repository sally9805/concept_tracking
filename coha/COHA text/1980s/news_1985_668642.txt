Democrats on the House Budget Committee struggled behind closed doors Tuesday to meet a Senate-set goal of $56 billion in budget-deficit reductions while keeping Social Security benefits intact and supporters of an across-the- board budget freeze in line . It was a day of budget talk on the Hill and tax talk in the White House , where President Reagan and his aides are preparing a tax-revision proposal . " We ' re coming in at $50 billion to $57 billion ( in savings ) without desecrating the senior citizens of America , " said House Speaker Thomas O ' Neill , ( D. Mass. ) during a briefing on the Democratic budget plans . O ' Neill said the House would meet the savings in the Senate-passed plan , but would depart from the Senate plan by preserving Social Security cost-of- living adjustments next year . O ' Neill also ruled out a tax increase to reduce the deficit . Meanwhile , in an obvious effort to head off deeper cuts in the military budget , Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the Pentagon has found $4. 02 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the President ' s military budget . The defense leader said the Pentagon so far this year has spent $4. 02 billion less than it had projected primarily because its inflation estimates were too high . Normally , Weinberger said , such savings are used to lower military spending when Congress takes up appropriations bills later in the year . Weinberger said he was identifying the savings earlier so Congress could use them to meet the lower Pentagon spending targets in the recently passed Senate budget resolution , which limits defense increases to the level of inflation . On the budget action in the House , Majority Leader James Wright ( D. , Tex. ) , who supports a minimum corporate tax to cut the deficit , acknowledged that the party was " divided " over whether to raise revenues to cut the deficit or lower personal tax rates . The 20 Democrats on the Budget Committee worked out final details of a plan that may be unveiled Wednesday . The group , joined by the committee ' s 13 Republican members , were expected to begin " marking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. , Pa. ) , the Budget Committee chairman , refused comment on the committee ' s progress , although sources said he was trying to negotiate a compromise that would keep conservative Democrats in line . Congressional sources said it was likely that conservative supporters of an across-the-board freeze , such as Budget Committee member Rep. Marvin Leath ( D. , Tex. ) , would be allowed to offer their own package in return for pledging to support the party ' s position rather than bolt as the " Boll Weevils " did in 1981 by teaming up with Republican House members to pass the President ' s budget and tax proposals . In this case , with a number of Republican House members opposed to freezing Social Security , " the greater fear is if you don ' t have them ( the conservative Democrats ) you don ' t have the votes to pass a budget resolution , " said a Democratic leadership aide . Leath said that while he can ' t speak for other conservative Democrats , he would be satisfied with an assurance that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one the Democratic leaders put forth . At the White House , Reagan worked on the tax-revision plan , reviewing options prepared by aides , but he did not give his final approval to a tax package being worked out by the White House and Treasury Department , White House officials said . Reagan , behind schedule on his long-promised tax bill , met with Rep. Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ; Treasury Secretary James Baker , White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and other advisers at the White House . An official said more meetings were planned for Wednesday , indicating that a tax-reform plan is not likely to be unveiled until next week at the earliest . There were indications Reagan might make a televised address on the matter Monday . Earlier , Reagan ' s spokesman , Larry Speakes , said a tax bill might be introduced by the end of this week . Briefing reporters before Reagan ' s meeting on the tax bill , Speakes said the President was still undecided on a Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the amount of personal exemptions to be allowed.
