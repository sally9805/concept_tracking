" You know , George , I feel that in a small way we 're doing something important , satisfying a fundamental urge . It 's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace . And we 're helping him get these things . . . " <P>  --  Peter Bailey to his son George in It 's a Wonderful Life <P> In the 1946 film , George Bailey took that advice to heart and , despite the requisite dramatic difficulties , made his family 's building and loan association a pillar of the community . But in real life , the outcome has been much different . America 's failed savings and loans have become the country 's biggest , most scandalous financial mess . Devastated by a legacy of bad management , rampant fraud and inept Government supervision , more than 500 of the 3,150 federally insured thrifts had fallen into insolvency as of the beginning of last year . Because the U.S. failed to own up to the problem and launch a major rescue soon enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined . Says Michigan Democrat Donald Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee : " We 've never faced a problem of this scale . The answers are n't going to be happy ones . " <P> Last week President Bush came forward with a long-awaited bailout plan in which he sought to spread around the unhappiness in an evenhanded way . Said Bush : " Nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude . " His program will require taxpayers and S &; Ls to share the burden of a rescue that will cost an estimated $126 billion during the next decade . The taxpayer portion would amount to about $60 billion , which would be contained in the federal budget over the next ten years . The Government would borrow $50 billion by issuing 30-year bonds to be repaid through revenues collected from S &; Ls . Including the interest expense , half of which will be borne by taxpayers , the total package could cost $200 billion or more over the course of three decades . <P> The Government is obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal regulators are already committed , including 205 savings and loans that the Government closed or sold last year . The $50 billion bond issue would be spent to liquidate or auction off the remaining 300 or more insolvent savings and loans . Those failing thrifts will be isolated from the rest of the industry by bringing them under a new agency called the Resolution Trust Corp. , which will oversee their cleanup . <P> Besides rounding up all that cash , Bush proposes to reform the system that supervises the thrift industry and insures its deposits . The main regulatory agency , the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , which has been accused of being too chummy with thrift-industry leaders , will be replaced by one chairman who will answer to the Treasury Secretary . The exhausted Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , which guarantees deposits , will be overseen by its healthier and better-staffed counterpart for the banking industry , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Banks and thrifts have traditionally had separate regulators and roles : S &; Ls specialized in taking long-term savings deposits and issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated on making commercial loans .
