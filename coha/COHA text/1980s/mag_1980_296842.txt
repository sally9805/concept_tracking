Jimmy Carter 's returns to Plains once seemed a celebration of his small-town roots , but they have come to resemble a political ritual , something the President may be doing because he feels it is expected of him . So it was on the Fourth of July weekend as Carter diligently strolled down Main Street , diligently went fishing , diligently attended church three times on Sunday . His neighbors , never over-awed by the local celebrity , seem less impressed than ever . " He could be doing something more useful in Washington , " grumbled one storekeeper . " He do n't even help business in Plains no more . " <P> During the Main Street stroll , a little girl gaped at the famed peanut farmer . " You 're so changed , " she said . <P> " For better or for worse ? " the President asked . <P> The girl gave no answer . <P> The ritual of rituals is the softball game , a rigid study in presidential informality . " O.K. , where are the victims ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The White House team was loaded with Secret Service agents . " I thought the game was fixed when you bring ballplayers in from all over the country just to play one game , " jeered a newly trim and fit Brother Billy , captain of the opposing team , a collection of locals and reporters . <P> The President pitched with intensity . He got one hit , a double , in five trips to the plate . He also walked once and once reached first with the help of an uncounted error . The final score was 13 to 3 , and despite the heat Carter insisted on playing all nine innings . Said Billy : " It 's the first thing he 's won in so damn long , it 's time he won something . " <P> The President was not finished . After the game was over , he insisted on jogging around the parched field for another ten minutes . For a 55-year-old man embarking on a campaign against a 69-year-old challenger , it was quite a competitive display .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
