A filly wins the Derby for the first time since 1915 <P> The 106th running of the Kentucky Derby was a handicapper 's nightmare . After the past three years of supercolts and solid favorites , bookmakers and bettors were forced to sort through a bewildering field of sometime winners , oftentime also-rans and even a filly . Not only was there no 1980 equivalent of Seattle Slew , Affirmed or Spectacular Bid among the current crop of three-year-olds , there was not even an Honest Pleasure around to make things interesting . <P> Last season 's top two-year-old , Rockhill Native , entered the 1980 season as the whiter book favorite , but when it came time for winter racing , he could not match his illustrious predecessors . Rockhill Native campaigned in Florida , at times giving a good imitation of a colt slogging through the swamps , not tuning up for the Triple Crown . Horseplayers promptly started looking for other contenders . <P> What they found was a series of colts whose owners could not even keep matters straight . Actor Jack Klugman gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jaklin Klugman would become the first colt to win the Kentucky Derby in drag . Plugged Nickle 's chances were rated highly after he won the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park and the Wood Memorial at New York 's Aqueduct Racetrack , but the odds on his owner 's winning a spelling bee were not worth a plugged nickel . <P> To misnomer and misspelling was added missed opportunity . The top California colt , Codex , was ineligible to com pete after his trainer forgot to enter the horse 's name on the Kentucky Derby nominating list . Codex had won the Hollywood Derby and beaten Affirmed 's time in winning the Santa Anita Derby , so his absence weakened the field considerably . Training injuries kept other key colts from the contest . Adelphi University Mathematics Professor William Quirin ran a computer comparison of Derby entries and passed harsh judgment : " This is the second worst crop of three-year-olds to come along in 25 years . " * <P> Indeed the lineup was so unimpressive that Trainer Leroy Jolley took the uncommon step of entering a filly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the run for the roses since 1959 . Only one female had ever won the race , Regret in 1915 . Said one bookmaker : " Any time a Derby field is n't strong enough to scare off the girls , you 've got trouble . " <P> As it turned out , this girl had nothing to fear . While 132,000 fans watched in astonishment , she roared into the lead at the top of the home stretch , rushing away to a one-length victory over two California horses , Rumbo and Jaklin Klugman . The filly , carrying 5 Ibs. less than her male counterparts over the 1-mile Derby distance , was still running strongly at the wire , adding a convincing show of stamina to an upset victory that may well rank among the most remarkable in thoroughbred racing history . Genuine Risk won $250,550 for Owner Diana Firestone , and , as a 13-to-1 long shot , $28.60 for each of her $2 bettors.
