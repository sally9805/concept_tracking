Japanese autos invade Europe <P> The plight of the European auto industry sounds all too familiar to depressed American carmakers . Sales in 1980 declined an estimated 12% , while Japanese imports climbed nearly 30% . Thousands of workers were laid off or had their hours cut back last year , and losses by major car manufacturers are staggering . France 's Peugeot S.A. lost an estimated $33 million in 1980 , and BL Ltd. ( formerly British Leyland ) , maker of Triumph and Jaguar , ran $960 million in the red . In fact , BL Ltd. ' s very existence depends on its receiving $2 billion in government aid to help pay for development and introduction costs of a new 59 m.p.g . Mini-Metro model . <P> The aggressive Japanese are a key factor in the European auto slump . Hardest hit are countries that do not have an agreement with Japan to limit imports . In Sweden , for example , Volvo and Saab assembly lines have been working three-day weeks . The Japanese have increased their market share in that country from 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently command 10.3% of sales in West Germany , almost double the level of just one year ago . Because of lower labor costs , more efficient production and currency differences , a Toyota now sells in West Germany for up to 20% less than a Volkswagen . A recent cover on the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel showed a yellow car with slanted eyes for headlights and buck teeth projecting over the bumper . Since West Germany ships 27% of its national production of goods abroad , the Bonn government thinks that it can not impose import restrictions on Japanese cars without risking a damaging trade war . But pressure from labor unions is growing . Volkswagen this week had to put 6,700 of its workers on a shortened work schedule . <P> France and Italy , on the other hand , have stringent import restrictions that have prevented the Japanese from capturing more than 3% of the local markets . The success of its economical R-5 ( known as Le Car in the U.S. ) helped France 's Renault to increase sales last year by 11% . Italy 's Fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52.3% , despite weak demand for its larger models and intermittent strikes that reduced production in September by 48% . <P> So far , the Europeans have not been able to agree on a unified approach for battling the Japanese . In November , auto-industry representatives from France , Italy , Sweden , West Germany and Britain went to Tokyo to plead for export restraints . But at exactly the same time , Volkswagen Chairman Toni Schmcker was busy arranging an important deal with Nissan , maker of Datsuns , that could eventually lead to the production of up to 200,000 Volkswagens in Japan . Said one Volkswagen official : " I think there 's an American saying for it : ' If you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em . ' "
