God knows , the good father was not ordained to consort with the scribes , flacks , communication czars and other similarly unwashed tellers of tales and bearers of the news . But Rev. John J. Wall is viewing his new assignment as minister to the Chicago media with the excitement and trepidation of a cub reporter sent to cover a four-alarm fire . The 45-year-old Roman Catholic priest envisions many occasions for pastoral counseling and gab sessions with his ink-stained charges , in their spiritual temples of Our Lady of the Billy Goat and the nearby , icon-rich parish of St. Riccardo ' s . But he isn ' t quite sure of what his mission is  --  or why he was chosen to embark upon it . Father Wall , pastor of the historic Old St. Patrick ' s parish just west of the Loop , was appointed to the task last week by Chicago ' s media-conscious archbishop , Joseph Cardinal Bernardin , despite the priest ' s objections that he knows little about the inner workings of newsrooms , public relations firms or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without precedent in American Catholicism , said Father Wall , who emphasized that he is not part of the media department or public relations office at the archdiocesan pastoral center , rather a priest whose job is to pray for and serve as a spiritual guide for media people . The priest , who retains his pastoral duties at Old St. Patrick ' s , is regarded as a particularly effective pastor to the yuppie class , and he cuts a fine figure on the downtown streets with his square-jawed good looks and street-smart savvy . Father Wall is a native of Chicago and a former faculty member at the Niles College minor seminary of the archdiocese . After his ordination in 1968 , he was assigned to parish work on the Northwest Side and later in northwest suburban Arlington Heights . He said he anticipates that he will encounter many reporters and editors who will welcome the company of a priest , particularly one who offers ethical guidance and a sympathetic ear . The mission to the media , said Father Wall , is a natural outgrowth of another parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Faith and Work , a program designed to help professionals grapple with the ethical questions of their careers . " This is an effort to say to the media that we ' re interested in building a real relationship and that we believe in your vocations , " Father Wall said . " It ' s the church saying that we value the professions of people who are doing the work of the world . " The priest said that virtually every Catholic diocese in the United States has some kind of media representative who serves as a press liaison or spokesman for the bishop . But he said the Chicago archdiocese is the " first place in the country taking this kind of approach " to care for the souls of the media . " This is a signal that the church is sending that we want to build a relationship with members of the media , " said Father Wall , who conceded that many in the church , particularly those in the hierarchy , regard the press as an adversary . " We want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added . " Work is such an important dimension of our life and we want the media to know that we sense that what you are doing is of deep- down value . It ' s good work , because part of communications is to proclaim the news . And similarly , part of God ' s work is to proclaim the good news . " CAPTION : PHOTO : Father ( John ) Wall .
