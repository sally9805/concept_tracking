Sprawled across 80 , 000 or more square feet , three times the size of the typical home center , the no-frills warehouses offered everything from screwdrivers to sheet rock at rock-bottom prices . They sprouted in many large urban areas around the country - jumping from 47 outlets in 1983 to an estimated 300 by the end of 1986 - and some analysts predicted that they would snare as much as 12 percent of the home repair and remodeling market by 1985 and 15 percent shortly thereafter. // But while the warehouses may have driven some home centers and neighborhood hardware stores out of business , their market share has not lived up to advance billing . With $3 billion in annual sales , the giant outlets now account for just 5 percent of the $60. 1 billion market , and the current view is that their share will reach only 8 percent by 1990. // // ' Saturated Markets ' // " In a lot of cases , " said Stuart M. Robbins , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette , the warehouses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even cannibalizing business from themselves. " // Moreover , the home centers and other retailers fought back , cutting prices , emphasizing service and even redesigning stores to meet the challenge. // Indeed , the fight for market share has cut the warehouse margins so thin that more than 20 of the new stores have already closed , leaving the sector increasingly dominated by a handful of players . And though the overall number of warehouse outlets is continuing to rise along with hardware industry sales as a whole - to perhaps 400 units in 1990 - even some of the big operators have cut back their expansion plans. // " There ' s room for warehouse stores and there is room for other types of hardware retail outlets , but there isn ' t room for all of them , " said John P. Hammond , associate publisher for Do It Yourself Retailing , a trade magazine published by the National Retail Hardware Association . <> <> The ' Gang of Four ' // The shakeout has taken its toll on the warehouse leaders , known in the industry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Depot , Builders Square , Home Club and Mr. How account for 215 of the 296 warehouse stores expected to be in operation by the end of the year , according to National Home Center News , a trade publication. // Mr. How , the third-biggest operator , with 27 stores at the end of 1985 , recently closed its five Chicago outlets , which have since been purchased by the regional Handy Andy Home Improvement Centers . Owned by the Service Merchandise Company , Mr. How lost $10 million on its warehouse stores in the first quarter , according to analyst estimates , and National Home Center News has reported that the chain will sell its remaining units . The company , which has put on hold about a dozen more warehouses that were under construction , has declined to comment. // K Mart ' s Builders Square , the second-biggest chain , with 30 outlets at the end of 1985 and 50 more set to open this year , has yet to turn a profit after two years . Sales last year at Zayre ' s Home Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts ' expectations , but the company still expects to double its stores this year , to 36 . And the No. 1 warehouser in 1985 , the 50-unit Home Depot , saw its earnings fall by 56 percent last year , to $11. 6 million , from 1984 , although they rebounded in the first quarter of this year . <> <> Too Many Players // One of the problems warehouse stores face , said Frank W. Denny , president of Builders Square , is that they have to ring up an average of $16 million a year in sales to turn a profit . That compares , analysts say , with $5 million to $6 million for home centers and about $1 million for smaller retailers . To find that volume , many warehouse stores opened in urban areas that analysts say already had too many players . ( Almost all of them skipped the New York area , however , daunted by high real estate costs and severe competition . But Pergament operates four of the giant stores on Long Island . ) Warehouse executives said they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cyclical as the home building industry - homeowners repair their homes whether or not interest rates are high or the nation is in recession . What is more , the baby boom generation has reached the home-buying age , helping to create a surge in building and , of course , repairs. // Although there were already 23 , 900 neighborhood-type hardware stores and 8 , 600 home centers in the country in 1980 , according to the National Retail Hardware Association , the warehouse operators thought they could muscle into the market by using the aggressive discounting techniques seen in the supermarket industry. // Bernard Marcus , chairman and chief executive of the Atlanta-based Home Depot , said one of the keys to success in " entering a new market is to undercut the competition by pricing at wholesale or better . " <> <> Hard Impact on Earnings // What has happened , analysts say , is that as the number of warehouse stores multiplied , too many retailers were seeking to price " at wholesale , " eroding earnings for the sake of gaining market share. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware retailers waged a counterattack by altering their marketing strategies and product lines . Indeed , by the end of 1986 , the number of home centers will have grown to 10 , 000 while neighborhood stores will have edged up to 24 , 250 , the retail hardware association said. // Mr. Robbins of Donaldson , Lufkin said these retailers " have been forced to make some hard choices that have helped to segment the market . " He added that " anytime someone undercuts you on a broad base of items , those with niches will always do better. " // For example , he said , one retailer might specialize in paint or tools and another might try to be a convenience hardware store . <> <> Better Service a Factor // " If you buy a saw , you either know how to use it or you have to ask someone , " said John Landschulz , an analyst with Mesirow &; Company . " Most of the smaller stores can beat the warehouses on service. " // Hardware cooperatives , such as the Chicago-based Ace Hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-ops offer buying , distribution and marketing services to large networks of independently owned retailers , helping smaller stores compete with the bigger players. // Ace has helped some of its 4 , 800 member stores to set up service desks to show customers how to thread pipes , for instance , or cut glass . And the layout of more than 100 Ace stores has been changed into what it calls its " store of the future " format , which directs traffic down the " power aisles " where sale items are prominently displayed . <> <> Major Promotions // Major home center operators - such as Lowe ' s , the industry leader , Hechinger and Scotty ' s - " are selling the same hardware as before , but they ' re doing it through aggressive price cutting , large volume sales and heavy advertising , " said Mr. Hammond of the trade magazine . ( W. R. Grace &; Company , the second-ranked do-it-yourself retailer , put all of its hardware operations on the block late last year to raise cash for a stock buyback . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companies , the industry ' s fourth-largest player , which is growing rapidly through acquisition since emerging from Chapter 11 protection . An investor group later agreed in principle to buy the other Grace stores , including the Channel home centers . ) Given the industry ' s reaction to warehouses , the eight-year-old Home Depot , which had sales of $700. 7 million in the fiscal year 1985 , was right to emphasize service along with low prices , said the company ' s chairman , Mr. Marcus. // That approach suffered in the rush to expand in the last couple of years , analysts note , but should be revived now that the company plans to open just nine new outlets in 1986 . " We were spread a little thin , " Mr. Marcus said . " That ' s why we pulled back and retrained our people. " // The importance of service is expected to be stressed by other warehouse operators as well . And because many of the largest urban areas are " overstored , " much of the new growth for warehouses will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industry experts say. // " Ultimately , hardware stores and home centers are not going to prevent warehouses from making money and , conversely , warehouses are not going to drive everybody else out of business , " said Mr. Robbins of Donaldson , Lufkin. //
