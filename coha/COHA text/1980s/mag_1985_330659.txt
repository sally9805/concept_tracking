Finance Company Manager Frank La Barba , 30 , packs more than his American Express card when he leaves his home in Long Beach , Calif. , these days . In his luggage are twelve compact life-style support systems , including a 1/2- in. - thick electric shaver , a book-size radio , an even smaller iron , a collapsible fishing rod and a 5.3-oz. rechargeable power pencil sharpener . " They let me concentrate on the job , " he explains , " instead of running around frantically trying to resolve a minor problem that could become a major one . " <P> La Barba has lots of company . A few years ago the only accessories travelers needed were some soft-sided bags to jam under the airplane seat and a voltage converter for foreign trips . These days voyagers are taking off with a cornucopia of helpful little gizmos for grooming , business , sports and safety . <P> The main reasons for toting the mini-doodads : one-night stays and spotty service , which force many harried transients to become their own concierges . " Most vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer in the past , " says Duane Knapp , former president of the firm that publishes United Airlines ' in-flight catalog , " but now they do n't have time to send their trousers out to be pressed . " <P> The institutional wake-up call , rarely pleasant and sometimes unreliable , has become a thing of the past for those equipped with tiny travel clocks . One of the latest : Braun 's 3 1/8-in. by 2 1/2-in. voice-deactivated quartz model ( $40 ) . A crisp " Shut up ! " silences the alarm for a satisfying four- minute snooze . Caffeine addicts no longer have to wait for room service if they are willing to lug along Melitta 's 4-lb. automatic drip machine ( $40 ) , complete with filters , creamer and sugar bowl . The Take-along Desk Drawer ( $40 ) fits tiny office supplies in a lightweight nylon case  --  a mere 5 1/2 in. by 9 in . Contents include a paper punch , scissors , 6-ft. tape measure , screwdriver and a telescoping presentation pointer for meetings . <P> After work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescoping Hammacher Schlemmer 's 17-In-One-Golf Club ( $69.50 ) out of the briefcase . The . rotating head of the 1-lb. device can be set to iron , wedge and putt positions by manipulating a set of interlocking gears . <P> Looking good is the most pressing concern of travelers . At Bloomingdale 's in New York City , a new tool cannily combines several grooming appliances in one 6-oz. unit . The 4-in. blower of Schildkraut 's red plastic and metal gadget ( $33 ) becomes both blow dryer and handle for the iron . Another take-along is Le Dome ( $16.50 ) instant nail dryer . Simply insert fingers or toes into its plastic chamber , and a battery-driven fan dries them in two minutes .
