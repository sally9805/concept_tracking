The changing role of St. Anthony ' s Shrine in downtown Boston , specifically as it relates to the increase in street people , has caused a split in opinion between the shrine ' s rector and the friar in charge of helping the homeless . Rev. Louis Canino , OFM , the rector , and Rev. Joseph Nangle , OFM , agree that the Franciscan order should introduce a hot meal kitchen . The kitchen currently serves coffee and a sandwich and occasionally hot soup to 200 street people who show up each day at 1 p.m. on Otis street , behind the shrine . The split is over where the kitchen should be located . Fr . Canino , 41 , said he is considering several downtown locations , all on sites other than at the shrine . Fr . Nangle , 51 , opposes having the hot meal kitchen away from the shrine . " I feel very strongly about this , " he said . " I think the kitchen should be definitely established , but it should be located here inside the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said the shrine auditorium , with some adjustments , could be used for the kitchen . It was used for that purpose when the Franciscans occasionally served hot meals to street people on church holy days . Fr . Nangle said the church has compartmentalized religion and has taken it off the street . He said that being in the street and trying to help those people rejected by society is a form of reconciliation and that the kitchen should be established inside the shrine to keep it viable and meaningful . " Young people don ' t come here ( to the shrine* in significant numbers anymore , " he added . " But they will help with making the sandwiches for the street people . They want to help . But if it is strictly traditional church devotions , forget it . " Fr . Nangle , who was a missionary in South America for 16 years , stood in the street and pointed to St. Anthony ' s Shrine . " In 10 years , " he said , " this could be a museum . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen here . The church didn ' t stay relevant . ( St. Anthony ' s* could become empty in another 10 years . " The shrine has been a landmark on Arch street for almost 30 years for thousands of Roman Catholics who attend Masses in one of the three chapels in the 11-story building occupied by 36 Franciscan priests and nine brothers wearing their traditional long brown robes . But their traditional roles began to change two years ago , when the number of street people coming to the shrine seeking food dramatically increased . Fr . Canino said the numbers increased so drastically two years ago that it was decided to set up a daily bread line , with the help of Fr . Nangle , Rev. Raymond Mann and about 60 volunteers . Fr . Canino said the Franciscan community now is seriously considering " going beyond a bread line and starting a kitchen , which would also serve hot meals to these people . " He said 12 sites had been considered in the downtown area , adding that the shrine has settled on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the shrine itself . He said a final decision is expected to be made before Nov. 1 and that the $1.5-million purchase price for the new building hopefully would be raised , " through the generosity of Boston people . " He said the shrine is eager to establish the kitchen because " one of our primary ministries should be helping the poor and the oppressed . Our role is not just to administer the sacraments . " Fr . Canino said attendance at daily Masses is " about the same , " but that Sunday Mass attendance is down slightly . He attributed it to police crackdown on illegal parking in the downtown area . Church officials agree attendance at Masses generally is down across the country . Fr . Mann said of Fr . Nangle : " He decided you could write books and give lectures and that ' s fine , but it ' s most important to get out there were the poor are - the streets . " Fr . Nangle is out on Otis street every day at 1 p.m. when coffee and sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he admitted he was feeling down until he overheard a conversation between two women standing in line . They were both shabbily dressed . As they stood waiting their turn , one woman said to the other , " You know , if Jesus came back to earth today , I think he would be right here with us . " Said Fr . Nangle : " All of a sudden I stopped feeling sorry for myself and everything was all right . This is what the church is all about , or at least should be . Helping others .
