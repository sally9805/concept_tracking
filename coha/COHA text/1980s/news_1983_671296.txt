YOUR most enjoyable visit to Bravo Gianni is likely to be your fifth , possibly even your sixth , by which time the staff there may recognize you . Unless , of course , you are an Italian in New York for the season , or were a regular at Nanni Il Valletto , where Bravo Gianni ' s owner , Gianni Garavelli , was once the maitre d ' hotel. // When they know you , you are treated like a member of a club . A generous wedge of delicious Parmigiano Reggiano will be put in the middle of the table to nibble with your drinks . Or it will arrive before dessert with a jar of herb-flavored grappa , at no charge. // And you will be able to order the items on the menu that are listed as " s. q , " which stands for secondo la quantit a and means that the dish is priced according to the amount you request . If , for instance , you ask for fonduta con tartufi , an exquisitely rich and creamy dish of melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy to make it for you . If , however , you are not one of the regulars , your waiter may tell you there is no fonduta that evening at any price . We were charged $67 for two servings . Mr. Garavelli said later that his cashier made a mistake : the price is $50. // There are some excellent dishes to be had at this restaurant , and after six visits over three months , the treatment we were accorded improved . On our last visit , we had a friendly , attentive and patient waiter , who seemed happy to repeat some of the specials . He did not , as happened on previous occasions , disappear in the middle of taking an order . <> <> We did , however , have to ask for our change when we paid the bill. // Many restaurants play favorites : Bravo Gianni carries it to extremes . But if you like to " people watch , " this is one of the best spots in town , and you can dine well , especially if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the tableside preparations. // Most of the time , the pastas were beautifully prepared . The tortellini alla panna were cooked , not raw - unlike so many I have had lately - and were bathed in a velvety Fontina sauce . The pappardelle , flat , homemade noodles , was served with a light matriciana sauce of basil and tomato with bits of prosciutto . The pesto sauce for trenette , the thin flat noodles traditionally served with pesto , was creamy and redolent of basil . A nice touch was the addition of green beans and potato to the pasta . The cream in sauce Gianni , made with tomatoes , peas , prosciutto and Fontina , however , was burnt on the two occasions I tried it. // Fish was usually treated with respect even though some of the accompanying sauces did not live up to the high quality of the fish . But a moist red snapper was excellent with a delicately assertive caper-butter ; bass was nicely melded in a tomato sauce with clams and mussels . The zuppa de pesce , with its lusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp , lobster and calamari , is enough for two ; at $32. 50 , it would be nice if waiters told new patrons in advance about the size of the serving . Four large grilled shrimp were undistinguished , especially at $22. 50. // Most side orders of vegetables are carefully prepared , but , generally , meat dishes should be avoided . Chicken diablo was dry and tasteless ; beef paillard was tough . Veal piccata was overfloured , and there was nothing lemony about it . Osso bucco , I was told one evening , was not available because " lamb is not in season . " It was not worth asking for again , as I discovered on a subsequent visit : it was tasteless , and the sauce was burned . On two occasions , the veal chop was fatty , though grilled to a pink , moist turn . The second time it was also overcooked , though served in a delicious sauce of artichokes and red peppers , which contrasted beautifully with the sweet meat . The restaurant buys most of its desserts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made with marzipan , torta al cioccolato and the delices are worth every calorie. // Now if the owner would lavish as much attention on service as he did when he decorated his sophisticated restaurant with its smoked mirrors , gray- suede walls , plum carpeting , pink tablecloths and cut velvet banquettes , the new patrons could enjoy the well-prepared dishes as much as regulars do. // Diner ' s Journal // THE peninsula of Istria in northern Yugoslavia on the Adriatic Sea , a region that was part of Italy until the end of World War II , is renowned for many things - its pristine , rocky shoreline , its rugged countryside , its warm and hospitable people - and , not least , its rustic cuisine , which borrows from the spice shelf of the many countries that have occcupied it over the centuries. // Probably the most celebrated dish of Istria is called maccaruni , hand-rolled pasta-like dumplings about 1 1/4 inches long , plump in the middle and tapering to points at the end . They can be served with various sauces , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced meat stock , is served at Capriccio , 33 East 61st Street , a handsome Northern Italian-style restaurant owned by Remo and Ray Raicovich , natives of Istria. // Until recently , maccaruni was prepared only on request for select customers who called ahead ; while it is not yet listed on the menu , the brothers say from now on there will be enough freshly rolled dumplings on hand to offer them as a daily special. // Remo Raicovich , the chef , cooks the maccaruni perfectly ; they are resilient yet tender . The sauce , whose predominant flavor is lamb , is essentially a reduction of lamb bones , beef bones and veal bones ( all with some meat left on to enrich the sauce ) , onions , water , white wine and tomato paste. // These dumplings are dusted with Parmesan cheese at tableside before the lustrous brown sauce is ladled over them . The dish costs $6. 50 as an appetizer , $13 as an entree . This brown sauce also comes with an exceptionally good dish called fuzi , small folded sheets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain foods , like certain paintings and sculptures , evoke extreme and often contradictory passions ; strong tasting wild game , for example , or sauteed eel . One of the most disputable seasonal dishes around is tete de veau , or calf ' s head . Devotees of this peasant dish - combining calf ' s brain , tongue , cheek , part of the snout and ear , and served with boiled potatoes and a sauce vinaigrette - search out superior versions with the zeal of truffle hunters . Two of the prize plates sampled recently were at Cafe 58 , a comfortable , reasonably priced French restaurant at 232 East 58th Street , between Second and Third Avenues , and Pierre au Tunnel , a rustic bistro at 250 West 47th Street , between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. // Lovers of tete de veau are relatively undemanding ; they are not seeking any legerdemain by a chef , just lovingly prepared home-style food . The ingredients must be fresh , cooked to the proper degree ( each element has its own limit ) and with a simple but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nicely balanced creamy vinaigrette with diced eggs , while at Pierre au Tunnel the sauce is more garlicky . Both dishes are paragons of what they should be ; each ingredient shines on its own . At Pierre au Tunnel , the portion is enormous , a real bargain for the lunchtime crowd ( it costs $8. 25 a la carte at lunch ; $15. 75 as part of a complete dinner in the evening ) . // At Cafe 58 it costs $9. 50 at lunch , including appetizer , dessert and coffee , and $10. 25 at dinner ( complete meal also ) .
