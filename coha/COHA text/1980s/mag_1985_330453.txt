A scenario for the opening scene of Rambo : First Blood Part III . The pure fighting machine , as he is known , is in Buffalo on a special mission . But he gets lost downtown and strides into the City Court Building for directions . Bare- chested , with a sweaty bandanna around his head and what looks like an AK-47 rifle in hand , Rambo strikes terror in all who see him . A police alert goes out . Dozens of officers search the courthouse corridors . One policeman , Gerald Baetzhold , draws his revolver , trips and shoots himself in the foot . Our hero , unaware of the chaos he has caused , has already left the building and delivered a Rambo-gram , a terse but humorous message , to a lawyer across the street . <P> The real-life drama last week was precipitated by a joke : Rambo was an impersonator named Mark Stancampiano . Mission accomplished , he was heading back to his car when two more officers nabbed him . Stancampiano was later charged with disorderly conduct . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling Rambo-grams for six weeks at $64.95 a message , was excited by the publicity . Late last week he was planning to start a new service : the Miss Rambo-gram.
