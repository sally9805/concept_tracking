Someone lowers the lights , and the dozen people around the table close their eyes and breathe deeply . <P> After a moment of silence , Dr. Margaret Caudill says quietly , " With each breath , you become more and more relaxed . " <P> More moments of silence . <P> " With each breath , " murmurs Caudill , " you go deeper and deeper into your own world . " All is stillness in the room . <P> Finally , Caudill says : " At the count of three , I want you to open your eyes and sit quietly before you come back into the world . " <P> The ten-minute voyage away from the world is part of a weekly program at Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital that uses techniques of easing stress to fight hypertension . Begun in September 1982 , the program has succeeded in lowering the blood pressure of most of its participants . Besides relaxation techniques ( imagine watching your breath go in and out ) , the regimen involves a low-salt , low-cholesterol diet emphasizing fresh food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings , plus tests and an evaluation session with the doctor . ) Trying to meet the standards of the program , one man at the session mildly complains , is so hard that the very effort to cut back on salt makes his blood pressure rise . Caudill quickly reassures him . " We 're not here to make you hysterical , pressured people , " she says . " We 're here to make you be practical and moderate , so do n't get so worried about salt that it causes you undue stress . " <P> " If we ca n't keep our thoughts focused , does that mean we 're tense ? " another man asks . " Other thoughts will come to you as long as you 're alive , " says Caudill . " But the idea is you do n't get distracted . After a while , you will find that you have a ' quiet center . ' " <P> Later , one woman tells how problems at work were increasing her hypertension . " The stress and tension remained in me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth Israel 's program began to help her handle her emotions . She quit smoking and became much more relaxed on the job . Best of all , she stopped taking the three kinds of medication she once needed for hypertension , and watched her blood pressure drop in just nine weeks from a high 170 over 100 to a normal 120 over 73 . The stress she is under may be the same , she says . But , she adds , " it 's all in how you manage it . "
