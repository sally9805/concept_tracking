Even with the tax hike battle raging around him , Ronald Reagan retains the serenity and confidence that have been key ingredients of his amiable style . En route to Billings , Mont. , last week to appear at a Republican rally , Reagan spent nearly an hour chatting with Washington Contributing Editor Hugh Sidey aboard Air Force One about the rewards and penalties of the presidency . Sidey 's report : <P> After 18 months , the Grecian Formula myth is at last retired . " I say goody , " says Ronald Reagan . " I think a little more gray is in there , which has stopped all those items that I dye my hair , which I never did . " He is right . There is more gray in there . Whether it is the weight of leadership or nature belatedly catching up with him after 71 years is debatable . This morning the rest of him appears several decades younger . <P> The presidency so far : " I have enjoyed it , " he says simply and convincingly , but declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " Reagan continues , " there are days that are very rough , and there are some times when you are haunted by a problem for a few days until you know that a decision has to be made and there is no one else to make it but you . " Yet he has no regrets , not even a Walter Mittyish twinge to be back in the movies in a juicy wide-screen part . " I thought that I would miss that , " he says , referring to his switch from films to politics . Harking back to his days as Governor of California , he recalls , " Nancy and I looked at each other one night in the living room in Sacramento and said , ' This makes everything we 've ever done seem dull as dishwater . ' It is the same way here Washington . You get to help write the script . " <P> One reason he feels this way may be his concern about declining standards in film making . " They do n't make them any more like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lake Michigan . " We used to fret a little bit under the strict production code-rules , morality and so forth . It made for great writing . Today they can just turn to obscenities or profanity . The oldest rule is that you ca n't do anything onstage that 's as good as the audience 's imagination . Today they do n't leave anything to the imagination . " <P> His current world , of course , has not been unlike a giant stage filled with diverse characters . " It is amazing how quickly you befriend each other , " he says of his counterparts round the world . " You know that you are faced with the same problems and the same frustrations . " Companionship at that level of power is special , and he never felt it so deeply as at the time of Anwar Sadat 's assassination . " It was not just a sorrow , the sympathy that you have for someone well known , " Reagan says . " There was a feeling of personal loss . That was when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet these people .
