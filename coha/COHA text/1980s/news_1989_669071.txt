Dallas is one of those cities where if you ' re not careful , you could get swept away by the hype . You could ride out to Southfork Ranch where they film " Dallas " and pay a fee to walk around the trim white house the Ewings call home . You could stand at the grassy knoll at the foot of Commerce Street and see the spot where President Kennedy was assassinated . You could go to the first-ever Neiman Marcus and retire to Sonny Bryan ' s for authentic Texas barbecue . But if you ' re not the tourist trap type , the best parts of Dallas are the places not many people know about . These are the places where you forget you ' re in Dallas altogether ; places so kitsch or so cool or so useful the hype doesn ' t matter . Home sweet home It ' s a bit of a stretch to say you feel like Gulliver in Lilliput when you ' re walking through the Southwest Miniatures Collection : A Museum of Dollhouses , Antique Dolls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re in Texas , where big is best and brand new is even better . A whole lot of patience and Elmer ' s Wood Glue went into filling this two-story , 11-room tribute to tininess . Even if you ' re so Type-A you couldn ' t imagine making couches the size of earrings , it ' s amazing just to see how other people can . There ' s no end to cute in this restored home on Routh Street ( one dollhouse is filled with miniature dogs dressed up in people-clothes doing people-things ) , where even the volunteer staff wear uniforms of flowered , floor-length skirts and white pinafores . They speak in hushed , sweet tones and offer to follow you on a " mini-tour " ( pun probably intended ) for a not-so-minuscule admission fee of $3 for adults and $2 for children and seniors . Oriental rugs the size of postage stamps and elaborate chandeliers no larger than soup spoons fill the dozens of miniature houses from different regions and eras on display throughout the museum . There ' s a mini Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment building , even a brothel . As the brochure beckons , it is " the Southwest ' s only museum dedicated to the enchanting world of miniatures for adults and children . " Founded last year by approximately 60 Friends of Miniatures , the museum offers classes in how to make miniatures , or you can buy some in the gift shop , talk about them in the private tea room available for parties , or just walk around and look at them . Claiming that miniatures are the second most popular hobby in the country behind stamps , volunteer Louette Weiser says she and most other people embrace miniaturization because they realize " there is no way you can have a collection like this in the real world , so you have it in a tiny world . " Southwest Miniatures Collection : A Museum of Dollhouses , Antique Dolls and Toys , 2208 Routh St. ; 214-969-5502 . That does compute What calls most people to Dallas is business . Without beaches , mountains or even mild summer weather , most travelers see Dallas as a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re in the business mode , take advantage of Executive Briefing Service at the Infomart . " People can come here and we can evaluate all the alternatives for their business needs , " says Mike Weinnig , vice president of systems and services for Infomart . " That ' s what a lot of people do . They are in Dallas for a specific reason-a conference , a trade show , a meeting , a convention-and they come here . " What most people don ' t know is that the Infomart , a 5-year-old , 7-story marketplace of more than 100 computer software , hardware , consulting and telecommunications companies and services , is open to everyone . Unlike Chicago ' s Merchandise or Apparel Marts , you are not required to be a buyer or an exhibitor for access to the goods and services of Infomart ' s tenants .

Or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser printer . You can just call up and make an appointment to discuss your concerns ( same day service is available ) with an Executive Briefing Service representative . When you come into the glass and white steel building on Stemmons Freeway ( it was modeled after the Crystal Palace in London ) , you are handed a list of all Infomart companies . It ' s like having a personal shopper-and you don ' t even have to be Somebody Important . Infomart , 1950 Stemmons Freeway ; 214-746-3500 . When you ' re barbecued-out Dallas may be best known for its showy spots ; you know , places where people spend more time looking at who walked in than the food on the table . Cafe Mekong is different . This unpretentious brick-walled eatery on Bryan and Peak Streets in East Dallas is a refreshing respite from predictable Dallas-type spots . You still order by number at Mekong , where a wine and beer list has supplanted the brown-bag-it tradition . Very reasonable prices ( $5. 95 to $9. 50 for ba-tri shrimp ) and a low-key clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite among neighborhood residents , journalists and foodies . Spicing on the dishes ranges from hot to scalding and one friend insists the hot and sour chicken soup , with chunks of pineapple , fresh vegetables and a healthy infusion of cilantro , can cure the common cold . The wait staff is so accommodating that they sometimes offer to walk around the enclosed foyer with your small children while you finish a meal in peace . Cafe Mekong , 4301 Bryan St. , Suite 101 ; 214-824-6200 . High tea and chintz Caroline Rose Hunt ( yes , she ' s one of those Hunts ) is Lady Primrose , and a 100-foot grapevine from one of her ranches winds itself around the staircase leading from the first floor of her eclectic antiques and collectibles store to the only place in Dallas where you honest-to-goodness feel like you ' re in England . At the Thatched Cottage Pantry , chintz has been allowed to overbreed on all available surfaces and formal tea here is now so anti-trendy that it ' s trendy . From 3 to 5 in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , jam , pastries and tea sandwiches ( $9. 75 for a " full tea " of all of the above ) . The neatly printed pink menu offers this explanation : " The present Duke of Bedford informed the Lady Primrose that Anna , wife of the seventh Duke of Bedford , initiated the custom of tea in the early 1800s because she could not make it from lunch to 8 or 9 o ' clock supper . " Not one to argue with such authenticity , you can assume that this " presentation of ritual , " according to co-owner " Lady " Vivian Young , is also the real McCoy . As only the well-traveled and well-backed can do , Lady Primrose and Lady Vivian have managed to create an atmosphere that belies its location in a shopping mall connected to a hotel . The walls are " old plastered , " Young explains , and everything from the wood boards to the thatched roofs on four small shops on the second floor are replicas of English cottages . The doors and leaded glass windows are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are real-adding to the overall Englishness . Save the fact that it isn ' t damp and chilly and you can use your American Express card , you could for a moment be fooled . You can be talked into buying almost anything here-from a walking stick to a set of Limoges dishes-because everything looks so perfect . But no one will mind if you just walk away with some dried flowers , potpourri , a special blend of " signature " coffees and teas or just a smile . Lady Primrose ' s Shopping English Countryside , 500 Crescent Court ; 214-871-8333 . Two-stepping at the Mansion Anybody who reads food magazines knows about the Mansion Restaurant . It ' s where Dean Fearing , arguably the premiere Southwestern chef and inarguably a pioneer of experimental , classic regional cuisine , serves up combinations that dizzy timid tastebuds : seared salmon steak with hard-cooked egg-caper sauce , sweetbreads with eggplant croutons or grilled swordfish with mango , black bean , red chili sauces and jicama corn relish . But not many outsiders know about the scene before you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tables from the parquet floors so people can sway and swoon while Tony Shepherd is on the keys and his trio backs him up . And people do dance . To Gershwin , Cole Porter-real piano bar stuff . This is the bar where the city ' s gossip is played out and where former Sen. John Tower recently sat at a center table not abstaining from alcohol . It ' s just dark enough in there to make you look for your purse or feel for your wallet if you ' re insecure or Yankee . But you don ' t need to , because this is certainly not that kind of place . This is no walk-off-the-street , have-a-cold-one bar . It ' s dark and clubby , a place where men smoke cigars and women wear dresses without backs . The deer heads and the horse paintings on the dark green walls make it seem like a set from " Dynasty , " while the small tables and banquettes force you to sit real cozy and yearn for expensive champagne . Managing Director Philip Wood says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throngs of good old boys who come early and stay late for a Scotch or three . It ' s now a place where you expect Fred MacMurray and Donna Reed to emerge for a turn around the floor looking like they did 30 years ago-but with this lighting , they might look it anyway .
