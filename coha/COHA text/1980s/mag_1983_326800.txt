Peterson gives up his top spot <P> Wall Street brokers and financiers have long been accustomed to power struggles in the executive suite . But they have seldom seen the head of a major firm voluntarily and abruptly surrender his top spot because an ambitious colleague wanted it . That was precisely what Peter Peterson , chairman of Lehman Bros . Kuhn Loeb , did last week . <P> Peterson , 57 , Secretary of Commerce under President Nixon , stunned Wall Street by announcing that he will leave Lehman Bros , next January in order to turn over full control to Lewis Glucksman , 57 , who became co-chief executive only two months ago . Said Peterson : " Lew told me that after considerable thought , he had concluded that this arrangement fell short of permitting him the fulfillment of his larger goals and of realizing the full potential of his capabilities . He told me that he felt he could achieve that fulfillment only by assuming the sole direction of the firm . " <P> Peterson 's remarks set off rumors , and firm denials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close associate called the statement typical of Peterson , and attributed it to the temperament he had inherited from his Greek immigrant parents , whose surname was originally Petropoulos . Said the friend : " Everything Peterson said came from the heart . The key to the man is his Greek origin . No Anglo-Saxon could ever have made such an emotional and candid statement . " <P> According to Peterson , Glucksman told him about three weeks ago that he was unhappy with his role as co-boss . Peterson had named him to that unusual position two months earlier . " He spoke very movingly of how much his life was wrapped up in this firm , " the chairman recalled . The two men worked out an arrangement under which Glucksman will become sole chief executive of the 133-year-old firm in October and assume the additional title of chairman when Peterson leaves in January . <P> Glucksman , a burly stock-and-bond trader , joined Lehman Bros , in 1963 . He is known around Wall Street as a workaholic who often arrives at his desk before 6 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all knew that his entire life was dedicated to one day running the firm , " recalls a former colleague . Glucksman said last week that he was " grateful beyond words " to Peterson for " the wisdom and understanding he has consistently displayed during the years of our close cooperation . " He added , " We 've been good friends , and we will always be good friends . In fact , I do not have many friends besides Peter . " <P> Lehman Bros , had lost $18 million and was near bankruptcy when Peterson joined it as vice chairman in 1973 . He quickly moved up to chairman and embarked on cost cutting and rapid expansion . In 1977 the company merged with Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , a 1,200-employee investment-banking house with $12 million in capital . Lehman Bros , now ranks as Wall Street 's sixth largest firm and has more than 3,000 employees .
