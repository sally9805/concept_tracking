 | Father tried to move his hand again , but Jason tightened his fingers almost imperceptibly , and Father cried out in pain . Justice , too , cried out as if the pain had touched her . The two of them babbled in angry language as Father held his wrist , gasping . When Father could speak again , he ignored them , too . " I do n't need them as guests , and I do n't need you getting into forbidden things . They 're going , and you wo n't have another thing to do with them until they 're gone . " Jason and Justice left off their argument and heard the end of his speech . As if to stop the blacksmith , Justice took from her clothing a thin bar of pure gold ; she bent it to show its softness . Father reached for the gold and took it . Between two fingers he folded the bar flat , and with two hands folded it again , and tossed it against the front door . " This is my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need of you . " Then Father led Lared from the room , unfed and unhappy , to the forge where the fire was already growing hot . Lared worked there all morning , hungry and angry , but not daring to do anything but what his father asked . They both knew that Lared hated the work at the forge , that he had no desire at all to learn the secrets of smithing . He did what he had to , just the way he bore his share in the field  --  and no more . Usually that was enough for Father , but not today . " There are things you 'll learn from me , " Father shouted above the roar of the flames . " There are things no half-witted strangers are going to teach you ! " They are n't half-witted , Lared said silently . Unlike Justice , however , when he held his tongue his words went unremarked . It was one of the things he did best , holding his tongue . " You 're no good at smithing , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's father , narrow shoulders . I have n't pushed you , have I ? " Lared shook his head . " Pump harder . " Lared bore down on the bellows , pumped faster even though his back ached . " And in the fields , you 're a decent hand , and if you are n't big enough yet for a man 's load , you 're good at mushrooms and herbs and I wo n't even be ashamed of you if you end up  | a swineherd . God help me , I 'd even bear having my son be the gooseboy . " " I 'll be no gooseboy , Father . " Father often made things out worse than they really were , for effect . " Better gooseboy than a clerk ! There 's no work for a clerk in Flat Harbor , no need for one . " " I 'm not a clerk . I 'm not good enough at numbers , and I do n't know but half the words in the book . " Father struck the iron so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the tongs onto the stone floor , where it broke again . " Name of God , I do n't want you not to be a clerk because you 're not good enough ! You 're good enough to be a clerk ! But I 'd be ashamed to have a son of mine be no more useful than to scratch letters on leather all day long ! " Lared leaned on the bellows handle and studied his father . How has the coming of pain changed you ? You 're no more careful of your hands at the forge . You stand as close to the fire as ever , though all others who work near fire have taken to standing back far , and there 's been a rash of calls for long strong sticks for spoons twice as long as anyone thought to want before . You have n't asked for longer tongs , though . So what has changed ? " If you become a clerk , " Father said , " then there 'll be nothing for you but to leave Flat Harbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lared smiled bitterly . " It ca n't happen a day too soon for Mother . " Father shrugged impatiently . " Do n't be a fool . You just look too much like her father , that 's all . She means no harm . " " Sometimes , " Lared said , " I think the only one who has a use for me is Sala . " Until now . Until , the strangers came . " I have a use for you . " " Do I pull bellows for you until you die ? And afterward pull for whoever takes your place ? Here 's the truth , Father . I do n't want to leave Flat Harbor . I do n't want to be a clerk . Except maybe to read for a guest or two , especially late in the year , like now , with nothing to do but leather work and spinning and weaving and slaughter . Other men make up songs . You make up songs . " Father picked up the wasted iron and put the pieces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forge . " Pull the bellows , Lareled . " The affectionate name was Lared 's answer . Father 's anger was only temporary , and he 'd not bar him from reading , when it did n't keep him from work . Lared sang as he pulled the bellows . " Squirrilel , squirrilel , where go the nuts ? In holes in the ground or in poor farmer 's huts ? Steal from my barn and I 'll string out your guts To make songs with my lyre Or sausaging wire Or tie off the bull so he no longer ruts . " Father laughed . He had made up the song himself when the whole village gathered in the inn during the worst of last winter . It was an honor , to have a song remembered , especially by your own son . Lared knew it would please his father , but there was no calculation in his singing . He did love his father , and wanted him to be glad , though he had no common ground with him , and was in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lared did n't like as well . But he laughed anyway , and this time he was calculating . For when the verse was over and the laughter done , Lared said , " Let them stay . Please . " Father 's expression darkened , and he pulled the bar from the fire and again began to beat it into a sickle . " They talk with your voice , Lared . " " They speak in my mind , " Lared said . " Like ? " and he hesitated before saying the childhood word " ? angels . " " If they are angels , why is the cemetery so full today ? " Father asked . " Like angels . There 's no harm in it . ' they ? " " They what ? " They walk on water . " They mean no harm to us . They 're willing to learn our language . " " The man knows ways to cause pain . Why would an angel know ways to cause pain ? " There was no good reason . Before yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason could reach out his hand am.  | and stop Elmo the Smith with a subtle agony . What sort of man would even want to know such things ? " They can put thoughts in your mind , " Father said . " How do you know they have n't put trust in your mind as well ? And hope and love and anything else that they might use to destroy you ? And us as well ? Times are perilous now . Word is that upriver there was killing . Not just death , but killing yesterday . From such anger that had never been let out before . And here is a man who knows pain like I know the insides of iron . " And the sickle was complete . Father plunged it back in the fire , to let the iron know its true shape , and rubbed it on the hearthstone so it knew the earth , and would not offend at harvest time . Then he dipped it smoothly into the cistern , and the iron sang . " Still , " said Lared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work an edge onto the iron . " Still what ? " " Still . If they want to stay , how can you stop them ? " Father turned sharply . " Do you think I 'd let them stay from fear ? " " No , " said Lared , abashed . " But there 's the jewel . And the gold . " " It 's a low sort of man who changes his mind for the hope of wealth . Who 's to say what gold and jewels are worth , if things get worse upriver ? Will gold bring Mama back from the grave ? Will it make Clany 's flesh hold to her bones ? Will it give the old clerk sight ? Or heal the iron-bitten foot ? " " They 've caused no harm , Father , except that he reached out to protect me , when I sinned at his bidding . " Father drew back , thinking of the name Lared had offended by saying . " That 's the name of God , " said Father . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your sixteenth winter . " Lared , too , grew solemn . " You would turn away one who comes teaching the name of God ? " " The wicked can use God 's name as well as God . " " How can we ever know , then , unless we try them ? Or should we cast away all men who use the name of God , for fear they 're blasphemers ? What name will God use , then ? " " Already you talk like a clerk , " said Father . " Already you  | want them here too much . I 'm not afraid of pain , I 'm not afraid of wealth , I 'm not even afraid of a man who blasphemes and thinks he does no harm . I 'm afraid of how you want whatever it is they promised you ? " " They promised me nothing ! " " I 'm afraid of how you 'll change . " Lared laughed bitterly . " You do n't much like the way I am . What difference does a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sickle 's edge . " Sharp , " he said . " I barely touched her , and she cut me a bit . " He showed the finger to Lared . There was a drop of blood on the finger . Father reached out and touched the bloody finger to Lared 's right eyelid . Usually the rite was done with water , but it felt all the more powerful with blood . Lared shuddered  --  touch his left , and instead of a protection to Lared the rite would have been a fending , to drive Lared himself away . " I 'll let them stay , " Father whispered . " But all your winter work must come first . " " Thank you , " Lared said softly . " I swear it 'll do no harm , but end up serving God . " " All things end up serving God . " Father set down the sickle on the bench . " There 's another ready for a handlemaker . Blade 's no good unless it fits somebody 's hand . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same height , but always he looked down to see his son . " Whose hand were you made to fit , Lared ? Never mind , God knows . " But Lared 's thoughts were all on Jason and Justice , and the work they had for him . He spared no thought , not now , for his father 's pain . " You 'll not let Mother invent more work than last year , just to keep me from them ? " Father laughed . " Nor will I. " Then he touched Lared 's shoulder and looked gravely in his eyes . " Their eyes are the sky , " he said . " Beware of flying . It is n't the hunter 's shot that kills the dove , but the fall to earth , they say . " So except for Mother 's brittle silence and sharp remarks , Lared was unhindered that winter . From the first , even before the snowfall , he and Jason were every day together , everywhere together . Jason had a language to learn , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped him in his work . So he came with Lared into the forest , searching for mushrooms be- fore the first snow killed them all . And Jason had an eye for herbs , too , asking which was which yet knowing more of the answers than Lared , who had thought he knew them all . " Are the herbs the same as here , where you come from ? " Lared asked him one day . Haltingly , Jason answered , " All worlds come are same ships from . Are come . " " From the same ships . " " Yes . " Lared had been puzzling out coincidences . " The world of Worthing , that the book of the Finding of the Stars talks about . Have you ever lived there ? " Jason smiled as if the question caused him secret pleasure and secret pain . " Seeing it . But live there , no . " " Does this world called Worthing have something to do with the name of God ? " Jason did not answer . Instead he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's poisonous . " " Flower be  --  is poisonous . " Jason broke the stem at the ground , and tossed the flower far away . Then he freed the soil around the root and brought it up . It was almost perfectly round and black . " For winter eating . " He broke it open . It was speckled black inside . " Water hot , " he said , struggling for the word . " Boil it ? " " Yes . What is going up ? " " Steam ? " " Yes . Drinking steam from this , it makes children . " Jason grinned as he said it , to show he did n't believe that particular cure . They walked on . Lared found a patch of safe mushrooms , and they filled their bag . Lared kept up a constant chatter , Jason answering as he could . They came to the boggy ground near the edge of the swamp , and Lared showed Jason how to use his quarterstaff to vault the fingers and arms of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lared were running madly at the water , plunging in the staves , and overleaping the stream without getting wet . Except once , when Jason set the staff too deeply , and it did n't come away when he reached the other bank . Jason seemed at a loss for words , as he sat there covered  | with mud . Lared taught him some of the more colorful words of the language , and Jason laughed . " Some things is the same between languages , " he said . Lared insisted , then , that Jason teach him the words he used . By the time they got home , they were both thoroughly bilingual in cursing . The cry of " Boat upriver ! " came late in the day , at the time when travelers would often put to shore and spend the night in a friendly village . So Father and Mother and Lared and Sala all ran to the dock to watch the coming boat . To their surprise it was a raft , though the logging season was n't till the breakup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook-fire was much greater  --  one end of the raft itself was afire , right down to the waterline . " There 's a man aboard ! " shouted someone , and the villagers at once put out in their rowboats . Lared was in a boat with Father , whose strong arms brought them to the raft before any of the others . The man was lying atop a pile of wood , surrounded by flame . Lared pulled himself across the short distance between boat and raft , thinking to pull the man from the boat before the fire reached him . But , standing aboard the raft , Lared saw that the fire had already reached him , that it was burning his legs ; Lared smelled the flesh , the smell he knew from Clany 's death . Lared staggered back to the edge of the raft , reached out and pulled the boat near enough to get in . " He 's dead , " Lared said . Then the stench and the fear of having been aboard the flaming raft and the memory of flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the edge of the boat , casting up his guts . Father said nothing . He 's ashamed of me , Lared thought . He looked up from the water . Father had taken his hands from the oars and turned to signal the others to go back . Lared saw his face , how grim he looked . Is he ashamed of me , for being so afraid ? Or does he think of me at all ? Then Lared looked at the raft , clearly in view behind Father , though already growing distant as the midriver current drew it on . As Lared watched , the arm of the burning man rose into the air , black and flaming ; the arm stayed erect in the air and the fingers uncrumpled like paper in a fire . " He 's still alive ! " Lared cried .  | Father turned to look . The hand stayed up a moment more , then collapsed back into the pyre . It took a long time before Father again took the oars in hand and pulled for shore . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He did not want to . They had been so long without rowing in the current that they came to shore well downstream from the dock . Ordinarily Father would have worked the boat upstream in the calm water near the bank , but this time he sprang from the boat and pulled it onto Harvings ' gravel beach . He was silent , and Lared did not dare to speak to him . What could be said , after what they had seen ? The people upriver had put a living man on a burning raft . And though the man had been silent , no sound of agony , the memory of Clany 's death was too near ; she had screamed into their minds enough to sear them again and again . " Maybe , " said Father , " maybe the heat made his arm rise , and him long dead . " That was it , thought Lared . They had seen the sign of life , but it was no sign of life . " Father , " shouted Sala . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground above Harvings ' landing stood tall Jason , holding Sala in his arms . Only when Lared was halfway up the embankment did he realize that Justice was there , too , curled around Jason 's legs like a game animal freshly killed . But she was not dead ; her body shook . Jason saw the question in Lared 's mind , and answered it . " She looked into the mind of the man on the boat . " " He was alive then ? " asked Lared . " Yes . " " And you , too , looked into his mind ? " Jason shook his head . " I 've been with men when they died before . " Lared looked at Justice , wondering why she had wanted to look at death so closely . Jason looked away . Justice raised herself partway from the ground , and looked at him as the words came into his mind : I am not afraid to know anything . But that was not all , was it ? Lared was not sure , but he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , I am not afraid to know anything that I have done .  | " You 're so wise , " said Father behind them . " What was that raft ? What did it mean ? " The words of answer came to Lared , and he spoke them . " Upriver they have made pain into a god , and they burn the man alive so pain will be satisfied and go away . " Father 's face went ugly with disgust . " What fool would believe such things ? " Again Lared spoke the words they gave him . " The man on the boat believed it . " " He was already dead ! " shouted Father . Lared shook his head . " I say he was already dead ! " Father stalked away , disappearing quickly in the scant moonlight . When his footsteps died away , Lared heard an unaccustomed sound . Quick , heavy , uncontrolled breathing  --  it took a minute to realize that it was Justice , cold and immovable Justice ; she was weeping . Jason said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself away from him , sat up and bent her back so her head was clasped between her knees . " She will stop crying , " Jason said . Sala wriggled in Jason 's arms , and he let her down . She went to Justice and patted her trembling shoulders . " I forgive you , " Sala said . " I do n't mind . " Lared almost rebuked his sister for saying such silly , meaningless things to an adult  --  Sala was always saying inapproprate things until Mother 's hand was nearly raw from swatting h . But before he could speak , Jason laid a firm hand on his shoulder and shook his head . " Let 's go home , " Jason said softly , and drew Lared from the hill . Lared looked back only once , and saw in the moonlight how Justice sat with Sala on her lap , rocking back and forth , for all the world as if it were Sala who wept , and Justice who comforted her . " Your sister , " said Jason . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , but it was true . Slow to argue , quick to forgive : Sala was good . For all their friendship in the field and forest , Lared still felt shy of Jason , and terrified of cold Justice , who did not want to learn the village speech . Jason and Justice had been  | there three weeks before Lared worked up the courage to ask even such a simple question as , " Why do n't you ever speak in my mind , as Justice does ? " Jason deftly peeled the last shaving from the spade edge , and this time the iron blade-tip fit smoothly . He held it up . " Good work ? " " Perfect , " Lared said . He took the spade and began to nail down the iron sheathing . " Why , " he asked between blows , " do n't you want to answer me ? " Jason looked around the shed . " Any other wood work ? " " Not unless you count smoking the winter 's meat with the scrap wood . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason sighed . " Justice does it all . I do little . " " You hear what I think even when I do n't speak , the same as her . You walked on the  --  walked where she did , just the same , the day I first saw you . " " I hear what I hear  --  but what you saw me do , she did . " Lared did n't like that , for the woman to be stronger than the man . It was n't the way of Flat Harbor , anyway . What would it be like , if Mother had Father 's strength ? Who would protect him from her then ? And would Mother work the forge ? Where I come from , Justice said silently in Lared 's mind , Where I come from men and women care nothing for strength , only for what you do with it . She had been listening in from the house , of course . Since she was n't interested in learning the language , she often avoided their company , preferring to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs were always being sung , and Sala would say whatever words Justice needed to say . Still , Justice was no less with them , just because her body was n't there . And it annoyed Lared that he and Jason were never really alone together , no matter how far away they went , no matter how quietly they spoke . Justice even knew that it annoyed him , no doubt , and did it anyway . As to what Justice claimed about her people , Lared was not surprised that they made no difference between the sexes . Where Justice and Jason came from people walked on water and learned to cause pain and talked to each other without opening their mouths . Why should n't they do everything else oddly , too ? It was something else that interested Lared . " Where are you from ? "  | Jason smiled at the question . " She wo n't tell you , " he said . " Why not ? " " Because where she 's from is gone . " " Are n't you from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where she 's from , came from me . Where I 'm from is also gone . " " I do n't understand your puzzles or your secrets . Where are you from ? " Lared remembered the falling star . Of course Jason knew what was in his thoughts . " We 're from where you think we 're from . " They had voyaged between the stars . " Then why are you here ? Of all the places in the universe , why Flat Harbor ? " Jason shrugged . " Ask Justice . " " To ask Justice , I only have to think . Sometimes even before I think , she knows . I wake up in the night and I 'm never alone . Always there 's someone listening in on my dreams . " We are here , said Justice silently , for you . " For a blacksmith 's son ? Or a mushroom hunter ? What do you want from me ? " " What you want from us , " said Jason . " And what is that ? " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 've done , why we left . And why pain has returned to the world . " You have something to do with that ? " You 've known all along that we did . " And what do you need from me ? " Your words . Your language . Written down , simply , truthfully . " I 'm not a cleric . " That 's your virtue . " Who would read what I write ? " , It will be true . Those who know truth when they see it will read it , and believe it . " And what does it matter if they do ? " It was Jason who answered . " Our story wo n't bring burning rafts down the river . " Lared remembered the burning man who gave his pain as a sacrifice to some imagined god . Lared was n't sure yet whether Jason and Justice were good or evil  --  his very liking of Jason made him more suspicious sometimes than his dislike of Justice . But good or evil , they were better than torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't figure out what need they had of him . " I 've never written anything longer than a page , no one 's read anything longer than my name , a million billion people in the universe , you still have n't told me why me ! " Because our story has to be written simply , so simple people can read it . It has to he written in Flat Harbor . " There are a million places like Flat Harbor . " But I knew Flat Harbor . I knew you . And when all else that I knew was gone , where else could I go home ? " How could you know this place ? When have you ever been here before ? " " Enough , " said Jason . " She 's told you more than she meant to . " " How can I know what to do ? Can I write it ? Should I write your story ? " Jason would not decide for him . " If you want to . " " Will the story tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The answer to that , said Justice , and to questions that you have n't yet thought to ask . Lared 's work began as dreams . He awoke in the night four , five , six times , ever more surprised to see still the split-log walls , the packed-earth floor , the half-ladder stairway that ran upward into the tiny guest rooms . Fire , barely contained within the chimney . A cat stretching before the fire . The sheepskins half-ready to be parchment , drying on their frames . The looms in the corner  --  of course the village loom was kept here . All this had been in Lared 's eyes since infancy , and yet after the dreams it was strange . Strange at first , anyway , and then unpleasant , for compared to the world that Justice showed him in his sleep , Father 's inn was filthy , disgusting , poor , shameful . They are not from my memory , Justice told him . I give you dreams from Jason 's past . Unless you live in his world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nights wandering the clean white corridors of Capitol , where not even dust dared to settle . Here and there the passageways opened into bright caverns , teeming with people  --  Lared had never seen so many people in his life , had not thought so many might exist . And yet in the dream he knew they were but a tiny fraction of the people of this world . For  | li the corridors were miles from top to bottom , and covered the world from pole to pole , except a few patches of ocean , the only place where life renewed itself . There was some attempt to remember living worlds . Here and there among the corridors were little gardens , carefully tamed plants artfully arranged , a mockery of forest . A man could hunt mushrooms here forever , and find no life but what was planted and tended . There were trains that flew through tubes connecting place to place ; and in his dream his palm contained a disc , and he laid his hand on glowing plates to do everything  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booths where people who were n't there talked to you and told you things . Lared had heard of such things , but they were always far away , and never touched the life of Flat Harbor . Now , however , the memories were so real that he found himself walking through the forest with the stride of a corridor dweller , and the tracks of wild swine took him by surprise , for there were no impressions of the passage of living things on the floors of Capitol . As the setting grew more familiar , his dreams began to be stories . He saw life-loop players whose whole lives were recorded for others to see , even what ought to have been done by dark of night or in the privy shed . He saw weapons that made a man come afire inside , erupting through the eyes like flames through spoilt cloth . The life of Capitol was always on the edge of death , precarious as an autumn leaf resting on a fence rail on a windy day . Nowhere was the death of Capitol more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again Justice showed him the people lying down on sterile beds , having their memories drained away into balls of foam , and then waiting docilely as quiet servants injected death into their veins . Death in the form of the drug somec , death that only delayed itself while the frozen corpses waited in their tombs . Years later the quiet servants awakened them , poured back their memories , and the sleepers got up and walked around , as proud of themselves as if they had accomplished something . " What are they afraid of ? " Lared asked Jason as they stuffed sausages together in the butchery shed . " Dying first . " " But they still die , do n't they ? Sleeping like that gives them not another day of life , does it ? "  | " Not an hour . We all end up like this . " And he bound off another link of tightstuffed gut . " Then why ? It makes no sense . " " It worked this way . Important people slept longer and woke up less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then all their friends died first . " " That was the point . " " But why would you want to live , if all your friends were dead ? " Jason laughed . " Do n't ask me . I always thought it was stupid . " " Why did they do it ? " Jason shrugged . " How can I tell you ? I do n't know . " Justice answered into Lared 's thoughts : There is nothing so stupid or dangerous or painful that people wo n't eagerly do it , if by doing it they will make others believe they are better or stronger or more honorable . I have seen people poison themselves , destroy their children , abandon their mates , cut themselves off from the world , all so that others would think they were a better sort of person . " But who would think such cripples were better ? " " There were people who felt like you , " Jason said . But they never took somec , said Justice . They never slept , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for the honor and power of sleep , thinking it was eternal life , they only despised the ones who refused somec . It made no sense to Lared , that people could be such fools . But Jason assured him that for thousands of years the universe was ruled by people who lived only for sleep , who died as often as possible in order to avoid the sleep that would never end . How could Lared doubt it , after all ? His dreams of Capitol were too powerful , the memories too real . " Where is Capitol ? " " Gone , " said Jason , stirring the spiced meat before funneling another handful into the casing . " The whole world ? " " Bare rock . All the metal stripped away long ago . No soil left , no life in the sea . " Give it two billion years , said Justice , and maybe something will happen . " Where did the people go ? "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | make people obey her by changing what they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that 's degrading and turns people into animals . " Lared shrugged . Just so long as Mother let him learn how to make good ink , it did n't matter to Lared how Jason and Justice got it done . Jason looked for a certain fungus growth on certain trees , and gathered it into one bag ; he had Lared fill another bag with blackthorn stalks , though they cut his hands . Lared did not complain of the pain , because it gave him pleasure to bear it wordlessly . And as dark came on , and they were nearly home , Jason ' stopped and tapped a pine tree , which still had enough life in it to fill a little jar with gum . The funguses they boiled and ground up and boiled again , then strained out the thin black fluid that was left . They crushed the blackthorn into it , and strained it again , and then boiled it for an hour with the pine gum . At last they squeezed it through fine linen , and ended up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay black for a thousand years , and readable for five thousand . The parchment will turn to dust before the ink is too faint to see , " said Jason . " How did you learn to make such ink ? " " How did you learn to make such parchment ? " Jason answered , holding up a sheet of it that Lared had made . " I can see my hand through it . " " There 's no secret to parchment , " Lared answered . " The sheep wear the secret on their bodies till they die , and give it up when we butcher them . " That night Lared dreamed of how Jason met Abner Doon . How God met Satan . How life met death . How making met unmaking . The dream was given to him by Justice , as she - emembered it from finding the memory complete in Jason 's mind . Memories of memories of memories , that was what lay in Lared 's mind the next morning , when with trembling quill he began to write .  | Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lared of Flat Haven Inn . I am not a cleric , but I have read books and know my letters , ties , and bindings . So I write , with good new ink on parchment I made myself , a story that is not my own . It is my memory of my dreams of another man 's childhood , dreams that were given me so I could tell his tale . Forgive me if I write badly , because I have had little . practice at this . I have not the elegance of Semol of Grais , though my pen longs to write such language . All you will have from me is the plain tale . " The name of the boy I tell you of was Jason Worthing , then called Jase , without respect , because no one knew what he was or what he would become . He lived on a world of steel and plastic called Capitol , which now is dead . It was a world so rich that the children had nothing to do but go to school or play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew there , and they had to eat what other worlds sent them in great starships . " Lared read it over , and felt at once pleased and afraid . Pleased that he could write so many words at once . Pleased because it did sound like the beginning of a book . And afraid because he knew how uneducated he was , knew that to clerics it would sound childish . But I am a child , he thought . " You 're a man , " said Jason . He sat on the floor , leaning against the wall , sewing the leather boots he had volunteered to make for Father . " And your book will be good enough , if you only tell the truth . " " How can I be sure I 'll remember everything ? " " You do n't have to remember everything . "  | " Some things in the dreams I do n't even understand . " " You do n't have to understand it , either . " " How do I even know it 's true ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather and drawing the thread tight . " It 's your memory of your dreams of Justice 's memory of my memory of things that happened to me in my childhood on a planet that died more than ten thousand years ago . How could it help but be true ? " " What should I start with ? " Jason shrugged . " We did n't choose a tool , we chose a person to write our story . Start with the first thing that matters . " What was the first thing that mattered ? Lared thought through the things he remembered of Jason 's life . What mattered ? Fear and pain  --  that 's what mattered to Lared now , after a childhood without either . And the earliest fear , the earliest pain that mattered , that was when Jason nearly lost his life because he did too well on a test . It was in a class that studied the movements and powers of the stars , one that only a few hundred of the thirteen-year-olds ' t of Capitol knew enough to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the stars , and Jase entered his answers on a keyboard . Jase knew all the answers easily , for he had learned well , and he grew more confident as it became clear the test was below his abilities . Until the last question . It was completely unrelated to the rest of the test . He was not prepared for it . They had not studied it in class . And yet as he looked at the problem , he thought he understood how the answer might be found . He began calculating . There was one figure that baffled him . He thought he knew what it meant , but did not know how to prove it , to be sure , to be exact . A year ago he would have called it a good guess and entered his answer . But this year had changed everything . He had a way of finding out what he needed to know . He looked at the teacher , Hartman Torrock , who was gazing around the room . Then he shifted something in his mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , when they had been seeing something near . It was as though he could suddenly see behind Hartman Torrock 's eyes . Now Jase could hear his present thoughts as if he were  | thinking them himself  --  his mind was on the woman who had quarreled with him this morning , and whose body he wanted to cause pleasure to and cause pain to this night . It was an ugly sort of desire , to rule her and make her be like his own tongue , to speak only his thoughts , to disappear inside him when she was not in use . Jase never liked Hartman Torrock , but loathed him now . Torrock 's thoughts were not pleasant scenery . Jase quickly plunged deeper than Torrock 's present thoughts , moved among his unthought-of memories as easily as if they were his own , finding Torrock 's knowledge of stars and motions , seeking the meaning of the unfamiliar figure . And the exact figure was there , perfect to the fourteenth decimal place . Then he slipped gratefully from Torrock 's mind and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his table . The test was over . He waited . His score was perfect , when it came . And yet a red glow appeared , and hung in the air above Jase 's table . The red glow meant a failing score . Or a computer malfunction , or cheating . Torrock , looking worried , got up and came to him . " What 's wrong ? " asked the teacher . " I do n't know , " said Jase . " What 's your score ? " He looked , and it was perfect . " Then what 's wrong ? " " I do n't know , " said Jase again . Torrock went back to his own table and began talking quietly with the air . Jase , as always , listened to Torrock 's mind . The mistake had been Torrock 's . The last question should not have been on his test . It dealt with secrets that children should not learn until years later . Torrock had written it last night , meaning to append it to an examination he-would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added it to his beginning class today . Jase should not have been given the question at all ; above all , he should not have been able to get it right . It was a sign of cheating . But how could he cheat ? thought Hartman Torrock . Who in the room knew the answer , except me ? And I never told him . Somehow this boy stole secrets from me , thought Torrock . They will think that I told him , that I broke my trust , that I am not fit to know secrets . They will punish me . They will  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | bold enough to come out into the worm and take what they could . For safety , Jase walked forward from segment to segment as the worm rushed smoothly through its tunnel , until he came to a place where several people were gathered . They looked at him suspiciously . He was no longer a little child , he realized . He no longer looked safe to strangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her doing anything when he got home  --  just sitting there , waiting for him . If it were n't for the fact that she still had her job , still earned what pitiful money they had , he would think she sat down across from the door the moment he left for school , and II , sat there the whole time until he came back . Her face looked dead , like a slack puppet . Then , after he said hello , after he smiled at her , the corners of her mouth twitched ; she smiled , she slowly stood up . " Hungry ? " she asked . " Not much . " " Something wrong ? " Jason shrugged . " Here , I 'll call up the menu . " She punched in the one-bark meal menu . Not much choice today  --  or ever . " There 's fish or fowl or red meat . " " It 's all algae and beans and human feces , " answered Jase . " I hope you did n't learn to speak that way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever you want . " She punched it in . Then she folded down the little table and leaned on it , looking across at Jase , where he sat on the floor in the corner . " What 's wrong ? " He told her . " But that 's absurd , " said Mother . " You ca n't have the Swipe . I was tested three times before they let me have Homer 's ? your father 's child . I told you that when you were young . " " Somehow that does n't reassure them . " And it did n't reassure Mother , either . Jase realized that she looked genuinely uneasy , frightened . " Do n't worry , Mother . They ca n't prove anything . " Mother shrugged , bit on her palm . Jase hated when she did that , holding her hand palm up and gnawing on the fleshy part . He got up from the floor and went to the bedwall and folded down his bed . He swung up onto it and stared at the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known was a face since he was a child . When he was very little he had dreamed about that face . Sometimes it was a monster , come to devour him . Sometimes it was his father , who had gone away but still watched over him . When he was six Mother had told him who his father was , and Jase had known that he was right both times  --  it was his father , and his father was a monster . Why was Mother so afraid ? Jase longed to look behind her eyes , but he never had before . Oh , her conscious thoughts , now and then , but nothing deep . He was afraid of the way she gnawed her hand , and sat slackfaced in the chair when he was n't home , and knew the answer to every question he asked her and yet never seemed interested in anything  --  he was afraid , instinctively , that whatever was in her memories , he did not want to know it . For he experienced other people 's memories as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that once having dwelt in their minds for a time he could easily become confused about which things that he remembered were actually things that he had done . Many hours late at night he had lain in his bed , letting his mind wander , searching the nearby rooms ? he did not know how to range farther than that with his listening , prowling gift . No one suspected his intrusions . They thought their thoughts , held their memories , dreamed their dreams as always , unaware of this spectator . In his memory , Jase was no virgin  --  with the prurience of childhood he had been man and woman in acts he did not think his neighbors had imagination enough to perform . In memory , Jase had beaten his children , killed a man in a riot on a lower level , stolen from his employer , quietly sabotaged the electrical system  --  all the most memorable , painful , exhilarating acts of the people whose minds he entered . It was the hardest thing about the Swipe , remembering when he awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which things not . He did not want his mother 's memories to have such force upon him . And yet she was too afraid , still gnawing at her hand there at the table , waiting for the commissary to send them supper . Why are you so afraid because someone has accused me of having the Swipe ?  | page deleted  | page deleted  | she had unleashed another Swipe upon the world . " You ca n't be , " she whispered . " Mother to son , that 's the only way ? " " There must be other gifts in the world , " Jase said , " than those that reside in X chromosomes , only showing up when paired with a stunted Y. " Suddenly she doubled up her fist and brought it down like a hammer on his mouth . He cried out in pain ; blood from his lips rushed into his mouth as he tried to shout at her , and he choked . Mother backed away from him whimpering , gnawing on the hand that had just struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother to son , you 're clean , you 're clean , not his son but mine , not his but mine ? " But in his mother 's mind Jason saw that she looked at him with the same eyes that had seen and loved her husband . After all , Jason had Homer Worthing 's face , that well-known face , that face that frightened children in the textbooks in school . He was younger , thicker of lip , gentler in the eyes , but he still wore Homer 's face , and his mother both loved and hated him for that . She stood in the middle of the room , facing the door , and Jason saw that she was seeing Homer , as if he had come back to her , as if he smiled at her and said , " It was all a misunderstanding , and I 've come back to make you whole again . " Jase swallowed the blood in his mouth and got off his bed , walked around Mother and stood in front of her . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , and he reached out to her , reached out and touched her cheek and said , " Uyula , I love you , " and she took a step toward him , into his embrace . " Mother , " said Jason . She shuddered ; her vision cleared , and she saw that it was not her husband she held , but her son , and his mouth was bleeding . She dissolved into sobs , clung to him , pulled him to the floor and wept upon him , touching his bleeding lips , kissing him , saying over and over , " I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry you were ever born , will you ever forgive me ? " " I forgive you , " Jason whispered , " for letting me be born . " Mother is insane , said Jason silently . She is insane , and she knows I have the Swipe , and if they interrogate her we both are dead .  | He had to go to school the next day . If he stayed away he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to his home , where they would find Uyul , who was nobody except Homer Worthing 's wife  --  Uyul the monster 's wife , that was the name he found inside his mother 's head . I wish I had never looked , he thought again and again all night . He lay awake for a long time , and awoke often , always trying to think of a solution that was not terrifyingly desperate . Go into hiding , become a wall rat ? He did not know how the people with uncoded hands survived on Capitol , living in the ventilation shafts and stealing whatever they could . No , he would have to go to school , face it down . They had no proof . He had answered the question himself . Pretty much . As long as his genes did n't show it , Torrock had no proof that he was a Swipe . So he left his mother in the morning , and dozed in the worm on the way to school . He went to his morning classes as usual , ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and then the headmaster came and invited him to his office . " What about history ? " Jase asked , trying to act unconcerned . " The rest of your classes today are cancelled . " Torrock was waiting in the headmaster 's office . He looked pleased with himself . " We have prepared a test . It 's no more difficult than the one you took yesterday . Except that I did n't write tl3e questions . I do n't know the answers . Someone will be with you all the time . If you could perform an act of genius yesterday , surely you can do it again today . " Jason looked at the headmaster . " Do I have to ? I was lucky yesterday , I do n't know why I have to go through this test . " The headmaster sighed , glanced at Torrock , and raised his hands in helplessness . " A serious accusation has been made . This test is  --  an allowable act . " " It wo n't prove anything . " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test was negative . It was from the time I was born . I ca n't help who my father was ! " Yes , the headmaster agreed silently , it 's hardly fair , but ? " There are other tests , and your genetic analysis shows  --  irregularities . " " Everybody 's genes are different . "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Where could he turn for help ? He could think of only one possibility . Mother believed that Jasc 's grandfather was also a Swipe . If what Jase had was indeed a version of the Swipe that could be passed from father to son , and it had been going on long enough for Ulysses Worthing to know that it was hereditary , then there should be other Worthings with the same gift . Of course , the fact that Mother 's Little Boys did n't know about it meant that all the others had succeeded in keeping their gift secret . Row on row , hundreds of dusty pink plastic carrels with the gray-blue lettek C of the Communications Bureau in prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the older students went , and where they did n't . He went to where they did n't , the older section without individual printouts in each booth  --  and where there were n't enough externals to play the most popular games . Jason had sat for hours playing Evolution , in which constant environmental changes forced the player to adapt animals to fit . He got to the level where eight animals and four plants had to be adapted at once . Jase had a knack for it , but he was n't here to play . He carded the reader for charges , then palmed it for identification . The air over the desk went bright with directory entries . He flipped through it up , back , and to the left , until he got to the genealogical programs . He brought Genealogy : Relatives by Common Descent into the window and punched Enter . A much simpler menu appeared . He chose Male Relatives by Male Lines Only and entered his own name and code . Gracie identified him at once  --  his birth date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then settled slow as a dustflake toward the bottom . Above him , connected by a little line , was his father 's name , and his father 's name , and so on : Homer Worthing , Ulysses Worthing , Ajax Worthing , another Jason , another Homer . And spiraling around and out from the central column were all the cousins , hundreds of them , thousands of them . It was too much to handle . Nearest five living cousins only , he entered . All but five names disappeared . To his surprise , there were two near ones , and the next three were quite distant relatives , branching from his line more than fifteen generations back . Only the first two were close at all .  | Full current address , he entered . The nearest in blood was Talbot Worthing , a grandson of Ajax Worthing . But he lived on a planet forty-two light years away . The other cousin was nearer in space : Radamand Worthing , a great grandson of the first Homer . He was on Capitol , working as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that a relative had done so well for himself . Jase asked for a print-out . He heard the choke of a printer a few carrels away , and immediately went to get it , without signing off . On his way back he only happened to glance at the carrel he had been using . " Attention : You are required to remain where you are until a proctor comes to your carrel and gives you further instruction . Failure to comply will seriously endanger your academic standing . " Right now Jase figured it was n't his academic standing at stake . It was his life . If the test results were enough to call for the proctors , there was little hope the results would be benign . Fortunately , it would be a while before they could get permission to call for Mother 's Little Boys  --  that was a power far above what the university could normally command . The Swipe would bring that power , of course . But it would take time . If the test had convinced them he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell him the truth ? He did n't know how to search at a distance , how to look for strangers that he could n't see . Cousin Radamand was far enough away that he was well under the curve of the earth ; Jase took a deep worm , and in an hour he stood in the anteroom of the office of Radamand Worthing , supervisor of district 10 of Napa Sector . " Do you have an appointment , young man ? " asked the receptionist . " I do n't need one , " said Jase . He tried to search for someone behind the door of Radamand 's office , but without knowing who was there , or where in the other room he was , he hardly knew how to begin . As always when he could not see the person he searched for , he saw only flashes of random thoughts , connected to no one person , telling no particular story . " Everyone needs an appointment , little boy . " There was  | menace in her voice . Jase knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in fact she was trained to kill ; Radamand kept a bodyguard in front of his door . Jase studied her a moment , took a potent name out of her memory . " Would Hilvock need one ? If he came wearing white ? " Her face went a deep red . " Never , " she said . " How did you know ? " " Tell Radamand Worthing that his blue-eyed cousin Jason is here to see him . " " Do you think you 're the first to pretend to be a relative of his ? " But she stared at his pure blue eyes and he knew she did not doubt him . ry " I 'm the first to know how much money he makes from opening the foundation space to manufacturing . And from child labor , since Mother 's Little Boys have no eyes down there . " He did not take this from her mind . He had finally found his cousin in the other room . And now he could not so much as notice the woman who watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind . Radamand had the Swipe , all right ; it was hereditary , all right ; the question was if Jason would live to escape this place . Radamand was wise  --  he knew there was profit in knowing secrets . District supervisor , that was all he was  --  but he knew so much about so many , had such a quiet reputation , that his power extended far into the heart of Capitol . And power breeds power , for the more you are believed to have , the more you have as others fear to cross you  --  Radamand knew that , too . Who could take him by surprise ? He seemed to anticipate every move to thwart him . There were corpses here and there in Capitol that he had arranged for  --  but murder was not a thing that pleased him much . He took far more pleasure out of watching people who thought they were fearless as they learned to fear him , tasting the panic when they realized what was known about them , things that no one could know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he was , that the mere memory of Radamand 's will was stronger than Jase 's present self . Radamand 's memories inhabited Jason 's mind as if they were his own . Jase tasted Radamand 's delight in making others obey him , and it was as sweet to him as it was to Radamand.  | As sweet to him , and yet there was Jase 's own self , revolted at what he had done , at the murders he remembered committing , the lives he remembered having destroyed , and he could not bear to have such memories inside his head . How could I have done it ! cried Jase silently . How can I undo what I have done ! He cried out . The receptionist was startled . He was a child , but a dangerous one , and all the more dangerous because of his seeming madness , to seem suddenly to be in pain like this . She got up slowly , walked to the door that led to Radamand . Jase finally reached the bottom , the worst acts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Radamand knew that a man who profited from knowing others ' secrets could not afford to have a dangerous secret of his own ? not one , at least , that anyone else might know . And who would know that Radamand was a Swipe ? Why , his own dear kin . As the first murder occurred to him , all the others had to follow . He killed his older brother on impulse , in the family 's swimming pool ; but from his father and younger brothers he could not possibly hide his guilt . They could see his memory of the act as well as he could . So he ranged through his house , killing every male that was kin of his ; and using Gracie he located as many as he could find , all who had the pure blue eyes of the Worthing gift , and killed them . Evading arrest was easy  --  he had information to sell to powerful men about other powerful men , and made himself too valuable to lose ; and for those not interested in buying or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared not harm him . Only two of his kin with the gift had he let live . Talbot , who was on a far-off colony , and Homer , the starpilot who had made it impossible to be known as a Swipe and live . Homer , who had died in a holocaust of his own making . Radamand was safe . His hands were foul with his brothers ' , with his father 's blood , but he was safe . It did not occur to him that some thirteen years ago or so Homer 's widow would choose to inseminate herself and bear Homer 's son . Radamand was not expecting Jason . But when he knew that Jason lived  --  and worse , that Jason knew " Cousin , " whispered Radamand from the door . Jase saw the death in Radamand 's mind and threw himself to the floor before the pellet was fired .  | Radamand did not move to try again , not at once . Radamand was looking now into Jason 's memories . Jase watched his own memories unfolding in Radamand 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : who knew that Jason was a Swipe . And in spite of himself Jase thought of his mother . And as he thought of her , he saw his memory of her knowledge pass through Radamand 's thoughts , but not neutrally , no  --  it was overlaid with the decision to kill her also . Mother and son , they would die , because if once it was discovered that another sort of Swipe could be passed from father to son , it would be only a matter of time before Radamand was found . The world would end if Radamand died  --  it would end , at least , for Radamand , and he cared for nothing else . It was too much for Jason , to have to hold within himself memories of his mother with intent to kill her . He screamed and threw himself at Radamand , who dodged easily and laughed at him . " Come , child . Try to surprise me . " How can I think of something that he does n't know I 've 11 thought of ? His only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was more skilled than he in seeing behind the eyes , it was not quickness that would count . It was chess , and what stopped the checkmate would be check : force him to move another piece . " You have no pieces , " Radamand said . He was searching in Jase 's mind for Jase 's address , so he would n't have any trouble finding Jase 's mother . " Radamand Worthing is a Swipe , " Jason said aloud . " So am I. It 's hereditary , father to son . " Did Radamand 's receptionist believe him ? Indeed she did . Radamand had no choice . If he did not kill her , she would surely kill him  --  Swipes were the most loathsome creatures imaginable , and she could not possibly be trusted now . Jason was only a boy . He was no direct physical threat to Radamand . The woman was a killer , as he well knew . He dared not leave her behind him . As Radamand fired a pellet at the receptionist , Jason fled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would n't be charged with her murder . Was it time enough for Jason to escape ? From the office , yes . From Radamand 's sector , yes . But  | Radamand knew his address , and would find him wherever in the world he hid . Even among the wall rats , Radamand had friends and would hunt him down . And what could Jason do in return ' ? If he denounced Radamand it was surely his own death , too . His only hope was to do what Talbot Worthing had done  --  go light-years away from Radamand , where he could not possibly be a threat . There were two routes off Capitol that a boy of Jase 's age could take . He could join the military , or he could go to a colony on one of the newly opened worlds . That would be far enough away for Radamand , surely . And once enrolled in.the Fleet or the Colonies , even Radamand could not touch him ? the administration of Capitol had no power in imperial services like those . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For if he did , Radamand would find Mother , and she would die . He must act to save her first . And the Fleet was not open to her , at her age . Only the Colonies for Mother . He had no choice but to go home now , at once . Yet R.adamand surely knew that Jason thought this way , and would be waiting somewhere along the path , ready to destroy him . At the thought of Radamand and death , his newly acquired memories flooded back . He remembered his brother 's face as he broke his arm at pool 's edge and then held him helplessly under the water until he drowned . I have no brother , thought Jason . But he remembered the brother , and his brother 's death . And pushing a knife into his sleeping father 's eye . And loving it . And could not bear the memories . Could not bear to be himself , with such a past . Not my past ! he cried out to himself . It is not my past ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not disregard what he so clearly remembered having done . He wept aloud in the worm as it hurtled through bedrock , skirting the molten furnace of the world . It caused no particular commotion , that he cried . They were used to weepers in the worm . When Jase got home , Mother was angry . " What have you been doing ? The butler went off in the middle of the day and said that you took a trip to the other side of the world ! How will we live through the month now ? Half the food budget , in one day  --  I should have restricted you , but you always ? " Then she realized his face was raw from crying , and she  | looked at him in wonderment . " What 's wrong ? " she asked . " You never should have given Homer Worthing a son , " said Jase . Mother looked distractedly toward the butler , which still showed a red alarm light . " It was naughty of you to run away from school . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till they were sure you were n't in here . " Jason immediately ran to the door and opened it , set a stool in front of it to keep it ajar . " Why did they say they wanted me ? " " Something about your answer to the third question . " The one that he missed . " He said you knew things that you could n't have known , " said Mother . " You must be more careful , Homer . You must never know things that you could n't possibly know . It makes people upset . " " I 'm not Homer . " She raised her eyebrows . " He was a starpilot , you know . " " We have to leave , Mother . " " I do n't like to leave . You go do whatever you must , and I 'll wait here . That 's what I like to do  --  wait here while you 're gone . And then you 'll come back to me . That 's what I like . When you come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me now , Mother , I 'll never come back . "  | page deleted  | travel fifty light years and wake up on a world where there was no hope of return , no hope even of somec , just work through the natural span of life to the end . " We have just the place for her . " " A place where you can walk around in the open , " Jason said . None of those pressure suit colonies for his mother . " We have just the place . Capricorn . It 's a yellow sun planet , just like Capitol . " Jase looked behind the man 's eyes . That was the assigned planet to push for the week  --  they needed more platinum and aluminum miners , and women to service them . Not what Jase had in mind . He searched the man 's memories until he found a planet that would do . " How about Duncan ? " asked Jason . The man sighed . " Why did n't you tell me you had a tip from inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had n't even had to terraform it . Mother stood at his side . " Where are we going ? " " Duncan , " said Jason . " It 's a good place . " " You just have to sign these papers . " The man began entering information at a keyboard . It was one of the ancient screen-view kinds . You 'd think the Colonies could afford something better than that . Name ? Occupation ? Parents ? Address ? Birthdate ? As he demanded more and more data from her , Mother began to retreat from her illusion . Marital status ? " Widow , " she said . She turned to Jason . " He 's not waiting for me , Jase . He 's dead . " Jason looked her in the eyes , trying to think of an answer . This was not a good time for Mother to be sane . The man smiled cheerfully . " And of course you 're taking your son with you . " " Yes , " said Mother . In that moment Jason realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own life , even though it was likely he would be arrested or killed the moment he left this office , he would not go to a Colony . Would not go off to the end of the populated universe and disappear . The Colonies were the only place his mother might be safe , but he had another alternative . The Fleet . In the Fleet he would be safe enough , might even become a starpilot . Like his father .  | " No , " said Jase . " You 're the legal guardian , according to this , " said the man . " If you say he comes , he comes . " " No , " said Jase . " You 're leaving me ! " she cried . " I wo n't have it ! " " It 's the only way to save your life , " said Jase . " Did you ever ask me , " she said , " if I wanted my life to be saved ? " Jase knew his mother , better than she knew herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " For as long as the voyage takes . " It stirred all the old memories . All the sleepings and wakings . Usually to find Homer there . The last time , though , she awoke alone . " I do n't think so , " she said . " I do n't think I want to do it . " " I 'll be there , " he lied . " No you wo n't , " she said . " You mean to leave me . You plan to leave me , just like your father did . " It was unnerving . How could she know him so well , without the Swipe herself ? But no , she did n't know , it was only her own fears . The worst thing in the world , to wake up and have him not be there . I am doing the worst thing in the world to her , for the second time . " Just sign here , " said the man . " Your personal code . " He pushed a keypad across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , " said Mother . Jase calmly entered the numbers for her , taking the code out of her memory . The Colonies man was startled , but when the code checked out correctly on his screen , he shrugged . " Such trust , " he said . " Now the lady 's palm ? " Mother looked at Jason coldly . " The old lady 's going crazy , so dump her off to another world , you looked at the man . " Do you know who his father is ? " The man shrugged . Of course he knew . He had Jase 's records up on the screen . " He 's his father 's son , not mine . " " It 's the only way to save your life , Mother . " " Who are you , God ? You decide who 's supposed to live and how ? "  | page deleted  | Jase was only too glad to obey . " I hate you ! " called his mother after him . " You 're worse than your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hatred keep you alive , thought Jason . May that hatred keep you sane . You ca n't hate me any worse than I hate myself . I am Radamand . All that he could do , I could do . Have n't I killed my mother here today ? Taken her out of the world . To save her life , yes . But then why did n't I go with her ? I am Radamand , remaking the world , breaking and bending other lives to fit myself . I ought to die , I hope I die . He meant it . He wanted to die . But even as he thought it , he scanned the minds of the people near him in the corridor . None was looking for him . He still had a chance to get away . And despite his feelings of despair , he would go on trying to escape until he succeeded , or until he was caught . So much for willing death . But how could he get anywhere ? The moment he palmed a reader he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to talk to Gracie , anything he might do that was worth doing would alert Mother 's Little Boys , and they 'd find him . Worse , he was legally an orphan now , since his mother had irrevocably signed on with the Colonies . It made him a ward of the state , and he could legally be searched for and found by anyone , without the lengthy legal process of showing cause . Until he could get himself enlisted with the Fleet , he was vulnerable . He used a booth and talked to Gracie , just long enough to get a directory and find the location of the nearest recruiting station . It was a good long worm ride to get there . Not as far as Radamand had been , but far enough . Did he dare ? His question was answered almost immediately . Leaving the booth , he again scanned the people near him  --  and one of them was one of Mother 's Little Boys , coming to get him at the booth . He ducked into a crowd and left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small  --  he disappeared and turned a corner , all the while keeping the man 's thoughts in his mind . Lost him , thought the man . Lost him . But they were looking , and it had taken only a few minutes at the booth before one of Mother 's Little Boys had reached him . He could n't ride a worm . Even if he palmed the reader and immediately got aboard , the worm would hardly have fin- ished acceleration before they got to him . So he had to walk . It was two hundred levels above him and four subs away . There was no hope of reaching there before tomorrow . In that time he would have nothing to eat  --  only water could lie had without palming for it . And where would he sleep ? In one of the twenty-meter parks , under a tree . The lawn was artificial , but the tree was real , and the rough bark felt good on his hand ; the needles pricked him but he needed the pain . Needed the pain so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he never did , and what he had just done . His mother was not sane  --  he knew that better than anyone , having seen directly how she lost touch with reality , how she lived in the constant hope of Homer Worthing coming home . But how was he any less mad himself , with the vision of his dying brothers before his eyes ? Why do I remember it this way ? Why ca n't I see it as a story that happened to someone else ? Why does my mother 's face blend so easily into these memories ? He could not separate what he knew he had done from what he knew he had not done . If he could shrug off Radamand 's acts , then would he lose the guilt for what he had done to his mother ? He was not willing to do that . Painful as it was , what he had done , he had done , and he would not give up his own past , even at the cost of keeping someone else 's . Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness of losing Jason . So he slept with the prickling needles clasped lightly in one hand , the other hand resting on the bark of the tree . I am what I have done , he said to himself as he dozed off . But he awoke saying , I was what I did . I am what I will do . It was a whole day 's walk , up the endless stairs , not daring to palm the public elevators , along the corridors , taking a slidewalk when he could . He reached the Fleet recruiting station just before closing . " I want to join , " said Jase . The recruiter looked at him coldly . " You 're little and you 're young . " " Thirteen . I 'm old enough . " " Parents ' consent ? " " Ward of the state . " And without giving his name , he punched in his personal code , calling his data into the air above the recruiter 's desk .  | The recruiter frowned at the name . Worthing was a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow in your father 's footsteps ? " he asked . Jase said nothing . He could see the man wished him no ill . " Good scores , strong aptitudes . Your father was a great starpilot , before . " So there were other memories of Homer Worthing . Jase probed , and found something that surprised him . The world that Homer destroyed had refused him permission to draw water from their oceans . They had kept him there until the Fleet could catch him . They were not wholly innocent . The Fleet did not hate Homer as the rest of the universe did . Jase had grown so used to being ashamed of who he was that he did not know what to do with this new information , except to hope there would be a place for him in the Fleet . Perhaps , at last , he had a patrimony . But the recruiter only shook his head . " Sorry . I just applied you , and you 've been rejected . " " Why ? " asked Jase . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aptitudes . I 'm not allowed to tell you more . " He told Jase more whether he meant to or not . Jase was being refused entry into the Fleet because of his scores at school . He was too bright to be admitted to the Fleet without consent from the Office of Education . Which he would never get , since Hartman Torrock would have to approve him . " Jason Worthing , " said a man behind him . " I 've been looking for you . " Jason ran . The man behind him was one of Mother 's Little Boys , and it was arrest he had in mind . At first the crowds in the corridors helped him . They were moving quickly , and Jase could dodge among them , moving faster than his pursuer , and always out of sight . Gradually the man chasing him was joined by more , until a half dozen were working their way through the crowd . He could not keep track of them all . It was too hard , to look out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing , where they were . They caught him when the crowd was slow , for then he was too small and weak to force his way through . His size was no longer an advantage , the Swipe was no help to him , and he found himself sprawled on the ground with a savagely spiked  | shoe on his hand . Even so he was not afraid of pain : he ripped his hand away and , despite the agony of flayed skin and tornopen veins , he almost scrambled away into the crowd before they caught him , ankle and wrist , and cuffed and shackled him . " Tough little bastard , " said one of Mother 's Little Boys . " Why are you chasing me ? " " Because you ran . We always figure that anybody who runs should probably be caught . " But he was lying . They had orders to take Jason Worthing alive , at all costs . Whose orders ? Hartman Torrock 's ? Radamand Worthing 's ? Not that the answer made much difference . He should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything on the chance of turning a foul future into something better ; he had lost . But it was neither Radamand nor Tork who came to take him into custody . It was a short , stout , balding man who ordered them to unshackle him , and to cuff them together . The invisible field kept their wrists within a meter of each other . " I hope you do n't mind , " said his captor . " I would n't want to lose you again , after going to all this trouble . His hand is bleeding . Anyone have a healer ? " phi Someone passed a healer over Jase 's hand , and the blood coagulated and the flow stopped . In the meantime , the short man introduced himself . " I 'm Abner Doon , and I 'm the closest thing to a friend you 're likely to find in this world . I have d every intention of exploiting you unmercifully to carry out my own plans , but at least while you 're with me you 're safe from Cousin Radamand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? Jase looked within his mind and saw : everything . " I was asleep until you took that second test , " said Doon . " But when you got half right a question whose answer was n't known to but a handful of physicists , who were n't too sure themselves  --  well , the Sleephouse people wakened me . They have their instructions . I would n't have missed you for the world . " They went to an official highway , which Doon entered merely by palming the door , the way anyone else might board a worm . A private car was waiting . Jase was impressed , and willingly got inside . " Who are you ? " he asked .  | " A question I 've been trying to answer since adolescence . I finally decided I was neither God nor Satan . I was so disappointed I did n't try to narrow it down any further . " Jase probed his mind . The man was an assistant minister of colonization . He also believed he ruled the world . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Radamand , for all his machinations , would have been awed at what Abner Doon controlled . Even Mother  --  not Jase 's mother , but Mother , the ruler of Capitol  --  even she was his pawn . It was not the world he ruled . He could twitch , and half the universe would tremble . And yet he was almost utterly unknown . Jase looked him in the eyes and laughed . Doon smiled back . " It 's flattering that I 've had as much power as I have , for as long as I 've had it , and yet a goodhearted boy can look into my heart and still laugh . " It was true . There were no murders in Doon 's memory . Dwelling in his mind was not the agony that being Radamand had been . Doon did not live to shape the world to his convenience . He was shaping the world , but what he had in mind was not at all convenient . " I 've always wondered what it would be like to have a friend from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you noticed yet your stupid blunder at the Colonies office ? You proved you were a Swipe to the counterman . Now I have to put him under somec and wake him up with an old bubble , so he does n't remember it . It 's very unkind of you to clutter up other people 's lives that way . " " I 'm sorry , " said Jase . But he also knew that this was Doon 's way of telling him that his mistakes were being covered for . He felt better . " Oh , by the way , speaking of somec , your mother wrote you a note before she went under . " Jase saw in Doon 's mind the memory of his mother handing over a paper , her face stained with tears , yet her lips smiling as Jase had not often seen her smile . He clutched at the paper , read it despite the trembling of his own hands . " Abner Doon explained everything to me . About Radamand , and the school . 1 love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy anymore . " It was her handwriting . Jase shuddered in relief .  | " I thought you 'd want to know that . " Jase read the note again , and then they arrived . They went directly from the car into a short hall , and from the hall into a forest . This was no park . The grass underfoot was real , the squirrels gamboling on the trunks of the trees were not mechanicals , even the smell was perfect , with not a hint of plastic in the air . The door closed behind them . Doon turned off the cuffs . Jason stepped away from him , looked up into a sky for the first time in his life . No ceiling . No roof at all . He was afraid he might fall . How could people stand to live without a roof overhead ? " Dazzling , is n't it ? " asked Doon . " Of course , there is a ceiling  --  all of Capitol has a ceiling  --  but the illusion is well done , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doon . " Why did you save me ? What am Ito you ? " " I thought Swipes did n't have to ask questions , " answered Doon . To Jase 's surprise , he was undressing , shedding clothing as he led the way deeper into the woods . They came to the largest open body of water Jase had ever seen in his life , nearly fifty meters across . " Swim ? " asked Doon . He was naked now , and he was not stout . The bulk had come from protective clothing . Doon poked the armor gently with his foot . " There are those who want me dead . " Of course there were . Doon did not have Radamand 's advantage of knowing other men 's desires and secrets , to bribe and blackmail perfectly . " My cousin Radamand will be one of them , as long as you keep me alive . " Doon laughed . " Oh , Radamand . He 's due for his next sleep in the next few weeks . He 's a loathsome sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anymore . I doubt he 'll ever wake up . " Jase was horrified to realize that it was true . Abner Doon could cause the Sleephouse to kill a man . The one unshakeable verity of life in Capitol was this : the Sleephouse could not be corrupted . And yet Abner Doon 's influence reached even there . " Swim ? " asked Doon again , walking into the water . " I do n't know how . " " Of course not . I 'll teach you . "  | Jase undressed and followed the man uncertainly into the water . He could see that Doon meant nothing but good toward him . Doon was a man that he could trust . So he followed Doon out until the water was almost to their necks . Doon and he were nearly the same height . " Water is actually a very safe medium of locomotion , " Doon said . Jase only noticed that it was cold . " Now here , my hand is against your back . Lean back against my hand . Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax . I can hold you up . " Suddenly Jase felt very light , and as he relaxed he felt his body bobbing lightly on the surface , only the gentle pressure of Doon 's hand under him to remind him of gravity . Then the world turned upside down , Abner Doon had a back-breaking hold on him , and Jase 's face suddenly plunged under the water . He gulped , swallowed ; his eyes stung ; he desperately needed a breath , and dared not take it . He struggled to come up , but could n't break the hold . He struggled , he twisted , he tried to strike with his hands and feet , but he did not come to the surface until Doon pulled him up . And in all that time , Doon had meant nothing but good for him . Doon had intended no harm . If this is love , thought Jase , God help me  --  or is it that Doon is somehow able to lie to me , even in his own mind ? " Do n't cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What was that for ? " demanded Jase . " It was an object lesson . To show you what it feels like to be in something over your head . " " I already knew how it felt . " " Now you know even better . " And Doon calmly proceeded with the swimming lesson . Jase caught on quickly , at least to something as simple as a backfloat . The pseudo-sun was setting , and the sky turned gently pink . Jase lay on his back in the water , stroking the surface just enough to keep moving , just enough to stay afloat . " I 've never seen a sunset before . " " Believe me , that is n't how sunsets look on Capitol . The sky of this planet is greasy and dank . Sunset topside is downright purple . Orange is noon . Blue sky is impossible . " " What does this place imitate , then ? "  | " My home world , " said Doon . Jase caught his memories , and they were of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitation of a tiny corner of the place . Jason could see Doon 's longing for the rolling hills , the thick groves of trees , the open meadows . " Why did you ever leave it ? " asked Jase . " Why did you come here ? " Power is the only gift I have , thought Doon . Jason followed his thoughts . How to get power , how to use it , how to destroy it . A human being can only go where his gifts are useful . Capitol is the place where I must be . However much I hate it . However much I long to destroy it . Capitol is my dwelling place , at least for now . Then , suddenly , Doon 's thoughts changed . Jase heard him in the distance , getting out of the water . Jase tried to swim toward shore , but he was awkward and slow , and when he tried to stand the lake was too deep , and he only just recovered himself enough to return to the backstroke . Swimming  --  staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concentration , especially now that he was afraid , that he could spare little of his attention to probe in Doon 's mind . That was why he taught me . That was why he brought me here . To distract me so I would n't know what he had in mind . So I could n't predict his every move . He fooled me , and now what does he have in mind , what trap has he set for me ? When at last he reached the shore , Doon was disappearing through a door in the garden wall . Jase looked desperately into his thoughts , searching for danger , and found waiting for him Doon 's knowledge of the Estorian twick . A small marsupial with teeth like razors . He saw Doon 's memory of the little animal leaping at lightning speed onto the udder of a cow before the beast so much as noticed it was there . The twick hung there for a moment by its claws , then disappeared , boring upward and inward into the cow 's body , blood gouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had happened so quickly . It shuddered , ran a few steps , then dropped to the ground and died . The twick crawled slowly from the cow 's mouth , panting and sluggish and bloated . Jase had read about twicks , too , and knew something of their habits . Knew , too , that twicks had wiped out the first colony on Estoria and even now they were  | only restrained with ultrasonic fences that kept them confined to reservations . Why was Doon thinking of Estorian twicks ? Because he was releasing one into the park right now . The only prey the twick would want was Jase , and lase was naked and unarmed beside the lake . Yet still in Doon 's mind , Jase could find nothing but good will . That frightened him more than anything else  --  that Doon meant well for him , and yet had no idea how Jase would survive the attack of the little beast . Already the twick was perched on a branch not twenty meters off . Jase stood absolutely still , remembering that twicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . He tried , desperately , to think of a weapon . He pictured himself picking up one of the stones from the lake 's shore , and as he tried to bring it down on the twick , the little animal would leap up and eat his hand in midstroke . The twick moved . So quickly that Jase hardly saw the motion , except that now the twick was in the grass , and only ten meters off . Jase 's hand throbbed where it had been torn under his captor 's boot . The smell of blood is on me , he realized . The twick will come for me whether I move or not . The twick moved again . It was two meters off . Jase tried desperately to see into the animal 's mind . It was not hard to get the fuzzy view the beast had of the world , but it was impossible to make sense of the welter of urges . He would not know what the twick meant to do until it happened . Jase could not use the Swipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excruciating pain in his right calf . He reached down to pry the animal off . For a moment the twick clung , still boring into his leg ; then it wriggled out and immediately was burrowing into the muscle of Jase 's upper arm . The leg gushed blood . Jase screamed and struck at the animal with his left hand . Every blow landed , but it did no good . I 'm going to die , Jase shouted in his mind . But his survival instinct was still strong , despite the terrible pain and worse fear . Like a reflex he realized that the twick would simply jump from target to target on Jase 's body . It was only a matter of time until it hit a vital artery , or until it found the boneless cavity of his abdomen and devoured his bowels.  | But with each gram of flesh it ate , the twick would grow more sluggish . If Jase could only manage to stay alive , the twick would gradually lose its frenzied speed . But Jase , too , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great wounds . And he had no weapon , even if the twick were slow . He threw himself to the ground , trying hopelessly to crush the animal under the weight of his body . Of course the twick was uninjured  --  its skeleton was flexible , and it sprang back to shape as soon as Jase rolled off . But it had stopped eating for a moment , was not attached to Jase 's body , and it would be slower now . Jase scrambled to his feet and began to run . With a wound in his leg , he was slower , too , and before he got three steps away , the twick struck . But Jase 's back was to it now , and the animal only dug into the muscles under the shoulder blade . Jase threw himself to the ground , backward . This time the twick made a sharp sound and scurried a little further away . Jase tried to run again , skirting the edge of the lake . This time he managed a dozen staggering steps before the twick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jase broke stride , fell to one knee . The lake was only a meter away . I ca n't swim with all these wounds , thought Jase . Oh well , the coldly intellectual part of his mind answered . Maybe the twick ca n't , either . He crawled toward the water , dragging his left leg , for the twick had severed the great muscles of the thigh , and the leg would not respond to him , except with agony . Jase reached the water just as the animal struck bone . It was impossible for Jase to float . He just crouched under the water , holding his breath forever , trying to ignore the agony pulsing from his buttocks , from his leg , from his arm , from his back . He could feel the twick burrowing along the edge of his pelvic bone . His analytic mind noted the fact that this was taking the animal away from the vulnerable anal areas . Muscles can heal . I can live . Muscles can heal . The repetition kept him underwater despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twick slowed . It emerged from Jase 's body at the hip . Immediately Jase grabbed it , fumbled for its neck . The twick  | was slow , and Jase had it by the throat , crushingly . Now Jase let himself rise from the water enough to take a breath , still holding the twick under . The air came like fire into his lungs , and he almost immediately fell forward into the water again . But he did not let go of the slowly wriggling twick . His hands , if anything , held it tighter . He struggled with his elbows and one good leg to drag himself toward shore again . The water became shallow enough that he could keep his head above the surface without trying to stand . The twick vomited and the water went black-red with Jase 's undigested blood and flesh . Then , at last , the twick stopped moving . Jase found the strength to fling the limp animal out toward the middle of the lake . Then he fell forward , onto the shore , his face slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip still under the water . Help , he thought . I 'll die , he thought . After a moment he gave up trying to turn his thoughts into words . He only lay there , feeling the blood rush out of him , filling up the lake , touching every shore of the lake , until it was all red , all part of him , and there was nothing left in his body at all , nothing inside him now at all .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Lared did n't know how to answer without sounding foolish . He folded over the top of his tick . " Do n't overstuff , it goes lumpy . " Jason folded the top of his , too . " If you put shadowfern in it , the fleas go away . " Lared made a face . " And where will we find shadowfern in the snow ? " " I guess it 's a little late . " Now Lared had the courage to ask . " Doon is the devil , is n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , he promised me that he 'd die . " " But was he ? " " The devil ? " Jason heaved the tick over his shoulder like a collier with his sack . " Satan . The adversary . The enemy of the plan of God . The undoer . The destroyer . Yes . He definitely was . " Jason smiled . " But he meant well . " Lared led the way back across the yard to the house and up to the tinker 's room . " Why did he put you with the twick ? Did he want you dead ? " " No . He wanted me to live . " " Then why ? " " To see what I was worth . " " Not much , if you had lost . " " Not much for a year afterward  --  it took a long time to heal , and I still get twinges at my hip . Do n't ask me to run long distances , for instance . And I sit a little slanted . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jason always leaned a little to the left in a chair . " I know something else , too . " " Hmm ? " Jason cast his tick out along the bed first , and together they worked at smoothing it . " I know how you felt , with Cousin Radamand 's memories in you . " " Oh , you do ? " Jason was not pleased . " That 's why I insisted Justice give the story to you as dreams , instead of waking ? " " They 're always too clear for dreams . They feel like memories to me . I wake up some mornings and see these split-log walls and I think  --  how very rich we are , to have real wood . And then I think , how very poor we are , to have a dirt floor .  | I reach out sometimes when I come to the door of Father 's forge , to palm the reader . " Jason laughed at that , and Lared laughed , too . " Most of all , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there . It 's as if your memories are realer to me than my own . I like to pretend that I can see into their minds , the way 1 do in your memories . I look at their eyes , and sometimes I even think I know what they 're about to do . " Lared cast his tick over Jason 's . " They never do it , though . " " I wish I had been like you , " Jason said . " I wish I had been like you , " Lared answered . " What Doon did , with the twick  --  I do n't think he meant it this way , but it sorted out my memories . Coming so near to death , having so much pain , it does things to the way you remember the rest of your life . Nothing else seemed quite so real to me anymore . I still was not clean , mind you  --  I still felt guilty at what I had done to my own mother , at what I remembered having done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . I counted the days of my life from that moment . Before Doon , and After Doon . He had plans for me . He cleared my record of the blot that Torrock had put on it , he had Ra  - -  damand 's crimes made public  --  all but the Swipe  --  and my dear cousin was put on an asteroid somewhere . And then he made me a starpilot . Like my father . " " Justice has n't given me any memory of that . " " She never will . We 're trying not to clutter up your brain with things that do n't matter . I became a starpilot the way everyone else does . I was just better at it than most . The hardest thing , though , was to make sure I always won my battles in ways that could be counted as clever thinking  --  not the Swipe . There I 'd sit , knowing exactly what the enemy intended to do , and helpless to save as many lives as I might have , if I had been free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , see the enemy do a little too much , and people died to save my life . That 's a problem for you , Lared . If I can save a hundred lives by making it obvious I have the Swipe , which would lead to my death , is that better than to save only fifty lives in order to hide the Swipe , so I can live to save another fifty , and another fifty , and another fifty ? " " That depends on whether I 'm one of the fifty that gets  | saved either way , or one of the fifty that dies to save you . " Jason frowned . Together they cast the linen sheet over the ticks and tucked it in under them . " The tinker gets linen , and I have to sleep on wool . " " Wool 's warmer . " " Linen does n't itch . " " You did n't like my answer . " " I hated your answer . It does n't depend on whether you 'll live or die . It depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't come down to your personal preference . It never does . If it comes to what you personally prefer , then there 's no right or wrong at all . " Lared was ashamed and angry . Angry because he did n't think it was right that Jason should make him feel ashamed . " What 's wrong with wanting to live ? " " Any dog can do that . Are you a dog ? You 're not a human being until you value something more than the life of your body . And the greater the thing you live and die for , the greater you are . " " What did you live for , when the twick was eating you ? " Jason looked angry , but then he smiled . " The life of my body , of course . We 're animals first , are n't we ? I thought I would live to do something very important . " " Like make a bed for a wandering tinker ? " " That was exactly what I had in mind . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've spoken a dozen languages . Yours is just an evolved version of one I spoke very early in my life . My native language , in fact . All the patterns are there , and the words are changed in predictable patterns . This planet was settled from Capitol . By Abner Doon . " " When a child is very bad , they say , Abner Doon will come in the night and steal all your sleep . ' " " Abner Doon , the monster . " " Was n't he ? " " He was my friend . He was a true friend of all mankind . " " I thought you said he was the devil . " " That , too . What would you call the man who gave you the Day of Pain ? " Lared remembered , as he did more and more rarely these  | days , the sound of Clany 's screams , the blood pulsing from the leg of the man they carried upstairs , the death of the old cleric " You could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never . " Jason nodded . " And why not ? " " We were so happy before . Things were so good before . " " Ah . But before Abner Doon undid the empire , unslept the sleepers , things were not good . Life was empty or miserable for almost every living soul . " " Then why did n't they thank him ? " " Because people always believe things were better  --  before . " Lared realized then that he had made a mistake . He had thought , from all his dreams , that Doon was Jason 's enemy . Now he knew that Jason loved the man . It frightened Lared , that Jason Worthing loved the devil . What is this work I 'm doing ? I should stop at once . Of course Jason and Justice heard this thought . But they answered not at all . Not even to tell him he was free . Their silence was the only answer that he got . Maybe I will quit , he decided . Maybe I 'll tell them to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant scribe . As soon as I find out what happened next , I 'll quit . Lared was the forester for Flat Harbor , and so he had to spend a week in the forest , girdling trees . Jason was coming along . Lared was not glad . Ever since he was nine years old , he had girdled the trees for the winter 's lumbering . It meant days on end , wandering the woods that he knew better than any other in the village , seeing the old places made new and naked by winter , discovering where the animals were hidden , and above all spending nights alone in the wattle and daub huts he made himself each afternoon . No sound of anything but his own breathing , and then waking some mornings to see his breath like steam in the air , and other mornings to a thick fog in the woods , and other mornings to trackless snow hiding the ground from him , unmaking all the oldpaths , forcing him to make something new in the world just by walking forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have Jason with him , because Father insisted . " We 've never had winter before , not like this , " said Father . " In past years we 've been  --  protected . This year we 're like the animals  --  the cold can kill us , we can get lost , we can go hungry , a tool can bite us and who will be there to stanch the blood ? You go nowhere alone . Jason is needed for nothing else , he can go , and so he will go . " Father glared at Jason , daring him to argue . Jason only smiled . It was not a job that needed two men . Lared had been watching the trees all summer , and knew which ones should be harvested this year . Such trees were almost never close enough together that Lared could point out one for Jason to girdle while he did another himself . And if they worked the same tree , Jason was always getting in Lared 's way . By noon on the first day Lared made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Jason discreetly kept his distance . There was little snow on the ground , and that only in patches . Jason took to gathering mosses from trees and stones , sorting them into pouches in the woollen bag he had sewn for himself while Lared wrote . Not a word passed between them all afternoon . Yet Lared was always aware of Jason . He girdled the trees quickly , deftly , moving faster than he usually did . He knelt before the tree , and his chisel bit into the bark . He tapped it with the mallet and drove it all around the tree , then clawed the bark downward with the iron tool he had drawn for Father . Before Lared they had girdled twice , in two parallel lines around I the tree . But that took twice as long as necessary  --  once there was a single cut , the bark could be clawed off far enough to be sure the tree was dead before harvest in the deep snow . Then , next year , new shoots would come from the stump . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the shoots , so they could be dried to shape and then worked into stems and handles and frames on reed and wicker baskets . Nothing was wasted , and Lared was proud of how smoothly he worked , how quickly the job was done . He worked with such concentration that the sun was already setting when he realized that he had not yet made the hut for the night 's sleep . He had never done so many trees on the first day before . He had never had Jason Worthing watching him ,  | either . Now he was well past the remnants of old first-day huts . He did n't want to go back for them . Nor would it be practical to go on to second-day huts  --  they were too far ahead , and he always scaled the rock cliff of Brindy Stream on the second day , in broad daylight  --  that was n't a work for evening . So he would need Jason 's help to make a new hut quickly , with no old wattles to start from . No sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent and expressionless , waiting for instructions . Lared chose a good house tree , with a long low branch for the central beam , and near enough to a willow that it would not be inconvenient . Jason nodded and began using his own knife to cut the willow withes where they hung from the tree . Lared saw that Jason knew what he was doing , and could reach higher and cut longer sticks than ever Lared could . So after Lared had gathered the deadwood sticks for the wattle frames , he set to work making the daub at the edge of a stream . It was cold work , digging with a hand-spade in the muddy bank , and splashing water onto the soil with his wooden bowl . But he did it quickly , and by the time Jason had the withes woven together into large strong wattles , the mud was ready for daubing . Jason brought over the wattles one at a time . He quickly learned Lared 's way of daubing  --  taking a handful of large fallen leaves and scooping up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wattle and left them there ? the leaves made the wall thicker and warmer and more watertight than mud alone . Together they carried each finished wattle to the tree and leaned it against the beam . Because Jason had been able to cut such long twigs , the wattles spread out much wider than any hut Lared had ever made before  --  room for two men inside . They cut saplings to strengthen the door , and hung on it the sheepskin Lared carried for that purpose . It was fully dark before they had a fire going out in front of the hut . They heated water and simmered the sausage so it would go warm into their bellies for the night 's sleep . Lared went and washed the little pot , and when he came back Jason was already asleep on one side of the tent , leaving Lared with half the space to lay out his blanket and sleep . It was a fine hut , and Lared discovered that he did n't mind the sound of Jason 's breathing beside him  | page deleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to make Nuber 's Italy function much the way the Empire did . Only Abner timed and controlled things , watched carefully to be sure that the resentment built gradually , held off rebellions , kept them small and weak , biding his time . I do not want a few geysers , Abner told himself . I want a volcano that will consume the world . The only thing Nuber 's Italy had that Capitol lacked was Catholicism , a binding force , a common faith that bound at least the ruling classes together , ensured they looked out upon the world with a shared vision . The integrity of the Church , that was the one thing they trusted in the corrupt empire that Abner was giving them . Like somec . Like the Sleephouse . The common hope and faith of all the ruling class of Capitol and the Thousand Worlds . To sleep , and thus live longer than the poor fools who could not qualify . The integrity , the incorruptibility of the keepers of the Sleephouse was the faith of all . If through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It ca n't be bought , it ca n't be demanded , it ca n't be cajoled , it ca n't be had by fraud . Only by recognized achievement . It was the only thing that preserved the Empire of the Thousand Worlds , despite the rot that holed and softened it everywhere else . The faith in the final judgment of the Sleephouse , which measured men and women and gave them immortality , if they were worthy . I will bring you down , thought Abner Doon , and Lared shuddered in his sleep . It was only a matter of time , then , until Nuber 's Italy became ripe . In the meantime , Herman Nuber awoke from his threeyear sleep  --  a noble allotment of somec indeed , to sleep three years for each one year waking  --  a man could live four hundred years that way . But that was the esteem Nuber had won for himself , with such a creation as Italy . Of course Nuber tried to buy Italy , so he could play . But Abner would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princely , but Abner had no intention of letting Nuber save Italy . Nuber even tried to strong-arm him , sending hired thugs to frighten him . Abner had too much power in Capitol already , though . The thugs already worked for him , and Abner sent them back to Nuber with instructions to do to him what he had hired them to do to Abner . It seemed only just .  | Except it was not just . Nuber could see what Abner was doing to his empire . He was no fool . He had spent seven years of his waking life  --  twenty-eight years of game time  --  building Italy into a phenomenon that would stand in the annals of International Games forever . And Abner was destroying it . Not clumsily , but deftly , with exquisite timing and perfect thoroughness . It was not enough to provoke rebellion and reorganization . Abner was provoking revolution and conquest that would erase Italy from the map , utterly destroy it so there was no hope that it would ever rise again . When Abner was through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy and rebuild . At last he judged the time was ripe . Abner did a simple thing , but it was enough : he exposed the secret corruption he had brought into the heart of the Church . The outrage , the loathing it caused tore away the last pretense at legitimacy , even decency , that Nuber 's Italy possessed . The computer hardly knew how to cope with this , except with instant , overwhelming revolt . All the grievances in every nation were joined now with the anger of the aristocracy  --  all classes acted at once , and Italy was undone , the empire fragmented , the armies in mutiny . It took three days , and it was over . There was no Italy left in the game . Even Abner was stunned at how well it worked . Of course International Games used simplified patterns , but it was as close to reality as any game could be . I will do it again , thought Abner . And the pattern unfolded in his mind . The seeds of universal revolution were already there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only the hope of somec holding all in check . Abner 's work , then , was to postpone revolution until he was ready , until it would all come at once , until revolution would not merely change the government , but undo everything , even cut the threads that bound world to world . Travel between the stars must end along with everything else , or his destroying would be in vain . But here fate had been kind to Abner 's plans  --  indeed , he suspected , things might have gone the way I wish them to without my intervention . That was the problem with manipulating reality : there was no way to find out what would have been . Perhaps I make no difference in the world . But then , perhaps I do . And so Abner began the slow process of cor- rupting the Sleephouse . Allowing quiet murders and manipulations through somec . Allowing sleep levels to be bought with money or power , allowing bubbles of memory to be tampered with or lost , allowing petty princes of crime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw fit . When at last it all came out , the way somec had been misused , all the resentment would come at once , all hatreds would explode , with even the somec users themselves revolting against the Sleephouse , so that somec itself would be eliminated , even for the passage between the stars , even for the one legitimate use it had . I can do it , Abner said , triumphantly . But he was a man of conscience , in his way . He went to visit Herman Nuber , when it all was done . The man was stricken , to see his life 's work undone for no purpose that he could understand . " What have I ever done to you ? " asked Nuber . He was a very old man , it seemed , or at least very tired . " Nothing , " said Abner . " Did you win much , betting on the fall of Italy ? " " I had no wagers placed . " The sums involved would have been petty , compared to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt me , then , when it profited you nothing ? " " I did not want to hurt you , " Abner said . " What else , man , did you think it would do ? " " I knew it would hurt you , Herman Nuber , but that was a result I neither desired nor undesired . " " What did you want , then ? " " The end of perfection , " said Abner . " Why ? What is it about my Italy that made you hate it ? What low , small thing in your heart requires you to undo greatness ? " " I do n't expect you to understand , " said Abner . " But if you had taken this last turn , the game would have ended . The world of your game would have gone into stasis . It would have died . I was not against the beautiful thing you made . I was merely against it lasting forever . " " You love death , then ? " " The opposite . I love only life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . "  | " You are a monster . " And Abner silently agreed . I am the monster of the deep . I am Poseidon , who shakes the earth . I am the worm at the heart of the world . Lared awoke weeping . Jason touched his shoulder . " Was it as bad a dream as that ? " he whispered . Only gradually did Lared realize he was no longer in the plastic world of Capitol , but under the leaning wattles of a forest hut , with Jason leaning over him in the dim light coming from the edges of the sheepskin door . It was very warm inside the hut , which told Lared at once that it had snowed in the night , making a thick layer on their walls to keep in their bodies ' warmth . Indeed , the wattles sagged deeply , and unless they unbuilt them soon they would break and not be usable for next year 's huts . The urgency of the work took the dream from Lared 's mind , or at least pushed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late in the morning when Lared brought up the dream with Jason . Lared wanted the man beside him now , in the snow  --  it was cold hard work , and with Jason using the claw Lared could cut the girdle and go on to the next tree , leaving Jason to follow his tracks in the snow . Only when they reached the cliff were they together long enough to talk . " We have to climb this ? " Jason asked , looking at the snowcovered ledges . " Or fly , " said Lared . " There 's a quick way , but it 's too dangerous in the snow . We 'll take the slanting crevice there . " " I 'm getting old , " Jason said . " I 'm not sure I can climb it . " " You can , " said Lared . " Because there 's no other choice . You do n't know the way back home , and I 'm going up . " " It 's sweet of you to be so careful with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you climb back down to help me , or leave me as an offering to the wolves ? " " Climb back down , of course . What do you think I am ? " And then his rage burst out . " If you ever send me a dream like that again , I 'll kill you . " Jason looked surprised . How could he look surprised , when of course he knew all that Lared felt ? " I thought you 'd understand Abner , if you saw that dream , " Jason said .  | " If he had been here , he would have done it . " " Yes . " " And he would have come here to gloat , to see how much we suffered at his hands , the way he came to Nuber ! " " Yes . " And then another realization more terrible than the first . " He would have come to see us , the way that you and Justice came . " Jason said nothing . Lared got up and ran to the cliff and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevice , but the dangerous way , the quick way that he used when the rocks were dry and his feet were bare . " No , Lared , " Jason said . " Not that way . " Lared did not answer , just moved even faster , though his fingers had to fight for purchase and his feet kept slipping . Higher up the cliff , it would matter more , but Lared did n't care . " Lared , I can find the safe way in your mind , you wo n't harm me by going this way , you 'll hurt only yourself . " Lared stopped , clinging to the rock . " That 's the only person that a good man would ever willingly hurt ! " So Jason began to climb up after him . And not the safe way , either . Step for step , he followed Lared up the most dangerous part of the cliff . But Lared would not quit . He could n't , now  --  going back down this way would be far more dangerous than going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , brushing the snow from each handhold , each foothold if he could , trying to make the way clear to Jason , safe for him as he came up afterward . At last Lared lay at the top of the cliff , reaching down to help Jason up the last difficult clamber . They knelt beside each other on . the brink , looking down over the forest below them . In the distance they could see the fields and cookfire smoke of Flat Harbor . Behind them the forest loomed as deep , as black and white as ever . " Understand him ? He is the devil ! He 's the one who brought the Day of Pain ! He found the world at peace , and beautiful , and he destroyed it ! " " He 's dead , Lared . He had nothing to do with the Day of Pain . "  | " More trees to girdle ? " Jason asked . " No more dreams of Doon , " said Lared . " I ca n't tell this story without him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate him . I do n't want to remember being him . No more dreams of Doon . " Jason studied him a moment . Looking in my mind , are n't you ! Lared shouted silently . Well , see how much I mean it ! I would never do what Doon would do " Do n't you understand , at all , why he did it ? " I do n't want to understand it . " Mankind is more than just these billions of people . Together we 're all one soul , and that soul was dead . " " He killed it . " " He resurrected it . He broke it into little parts that had to change , to grow , to become something new . We used to call it the Empire of the Thousand Worlds , even though there were only some three hundred planets with populations . But Doon fulfilled the name for us  --  it was n't all destruction . He sent out huge colony ships , spreading mankind farther and farther from Capitol , so that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three thousand years , there truly were a thousand worlds , like a thousand spider balls , each one teeming with its billion people , each one finding its own way to be mankind . " And how many people were grateful to him ? Were they as glad as Clany 's mother , perhaps ? " It has been more than ten thousand years since then , and his name lives on as one of the devil 's names . No , they were n't glad of it at all . Is the apple tree glad when you cut it off to graft it into the wild-apple root ? " A man is not a tree . " As you are to the apple tree , Lared , Abner Doon was to mankind . He pruned , he grafted , he transplanted , he burned over the old dead branches , but the orchard thrives . " Lared stood . " There are more trees to girdle . If we hurry , we can make the third night 's hut tonight , and save ourselves some wattling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No more dreams at all . I 'm through . " " If you wish , " Jason said . But Lared knew that Jason agreed because he figured Lared  | page deleted  | The tinker was a cheerful man , and he loved to sing . He knew a thousand songs , he liked to say , a thousand songs , and all but six of them were too filthy to sing in front of ladies . Truth was he knew dozens , and if Sala 's work was done , she 'd sit at his feet and sing along with him  --  she had a memory for words and melodies , and her sweet voice with the tinker 's piping tenor were a sound to hear , and upstairs where he wrote for hours each day Lared liked to hear them . Liked it so well that every now and then Jason would say , " The world wo n't end if you take a breath now and then , " and they 'd go downstairs and tool the leatherwork that always waited , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinker sang . " Will you sing ? " Sala asked Justice . Justice shook her head and kept on with her weaving . She was not good with her hands , and Mother only let her do roughspun cloth , the sort of stuff that hardly mattered . The fine wool for shirts and trousers , that was done by cleverer hands ; and above all Justice was never let to touch a spinning wheel . The village women kept three of them , besides Mother 's own , in the common room of the inn during the winter  --  when it was the gathering place for Flat Harbor . Each day when they bundled against the cold and came , the women each brought three good faggots for the fire and a pear and an apple , or half a loaf , or a rind of cheese for nooning , and they made a feast of it . The men ate after , at a separate table , a hot meal that somehow seemed less cheery than the laughter from the cold table where the women ate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the men had theirs . But poor Justice , thought Lared , she belongs to neither . It was sad , for Justice made no effort at all to learn the language , and so while she understood ) everything  --  far more  | than anyone said , in fact  --  she never spoke a word to anyone , except through Sala or , occasionally , Lared  --  but usually Sala , for they were always together . Ever since Justice had tasted the pain of the burning man on the raft , from that time on Sala was Justice 's comfort , her company , her voice . Of all the women , only little Sala seemed to love her . So while Sala and the tinker sang , Justice listened intently , and Lared understood that Justice was , after all , capable of love . He could not see into her mind , as Jason could , to see she was drawn as much to the tinker as to Sala . The tinker was a laughing man , of average height and profound but solid belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were strange . Indeed , he must have made a point of making sure his eyes always included her as he looked from face to face around the room , that his ribald comments were directed as often to her as to any other woman in the place ; and Lared also understood if his smile seemed to fall on Justice more often than on any other woman . Justice was young , and none of her teeth had rotted , and she had a pleasant body and a face that in certain lights was beautiful , for all its sternness . The winter was long , and this woman seemed unattached , so why not try for her ? Lared was old enough to understand that game . But the chance of playing heat the sheets with Justice  --  well , if the tinker did that he was more of a miracle-worker than Jason . And I do n't care who overhears my thoughts , I 'll think what I like all the same . " Think what you like , " Jason said , " but Justice might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you have , so she has a right to be stern  --  and a right to love whomever she likes , whenever she likes . Begrudge her nothing , Lareled . " To Lared 's surprise , he did care who overheard his thoughts . Angrily he closed his penbox . " Do you always listen to my thoughts ? When I strain over the hole in the privy , are you there , feeling what I feel ? When my father takes me through the most sacred steps of a new man , will you be at his side , along with me ? " Jason raised his eyebrows . " I 'm getting older , Lared . If I 'm with you in the privy house , it 's to recall how easy it is for a young man , compared to the work I go through . " " Well , stop it ! " " You do n't know what straining is. "  | " Stop it ! " From downstairs came Mother 's voice . " What 's going on up there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm telling Jason that I hate him ! " Lared called . " Oh good , " Jason whispered . " That will make everything so much easier . " But the frank answer turned away Mother 's wrath . " At last you 've come to your senses ! " she called . " Will he go away now ? " " And will she give the jewel back ? " Jason whispered . " No he will not ! " Lared called down the stairs . " He 's not through studying how country bumpkins live . " He closed the bedroom door and returned to the writing table . " Well , if you 're ready to work , so am I. " " For your information , I have lived in far more primitive conditions than this . And loved it . " " Stay out of my mind .

What I write is always in the language of lies . For someone like me , that 's all language is for , is to tell lies . I get the truth in other ways . Other people never get the truth at all .

Somec kept me asleep and ageless while I traveled in deep space , and the ship woke me up whenever an enemy approached . No one ever killed me , and I killed a lot of them , and so I became very famous and popular , which meant I had a lot of enemies , and eventually they tried to kill me and so Doon sent me off as commander of a colony ship . " Lared spun the feathery tip of the quill between his lips . " You 're right . I can tell the story better than you . " " On the contrary . I know which things are worth telling at length , and which things are best skipped over . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Like what happened on that second test they gave you . I remember every bit of how much you worried about it , and nothing of how it ended . " Jason strained to push the heavy needle through the leather of Father 's new boot . " Whoever tans hides around here does a miserable job . " " He does an excellent job . His boot leather sheds snow and lets no water in . " " It also sheds needles . " Lared was feeling annoyed and impertinent , a delicious feeling which he intended to indulge freely . " Keep trying and someday you 'll be strong enough . " Jason got in the spirit of the quarrel and handed him the boot . Lared took the needle and with a circular , twisting motion drove it quickly and smoothly through the sole . He handed the boot back to Jason . " Oh , " said Jason . " The test , " Lared reminded him . " I passed it . But I could n't have . Because the answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another university a few months before .

But the finest minds were quickly put on the highest levels of somec  --  six months awake for six years asleep . The only people awake long enough to accomplish anything were the secondrate minds .

He saw that I went to Radamand , he overheard our conversation ? the walls were ears  --  and he saw how I shipped my own mother off on a colony ship . Ruthlessness in a child  --  he found it charming . " " You had no choice .

It was two hours before Hop could get away from the loopers long enough to tell Jazz about the note . By then Jason had already found a dozen people in the crowds around him who were in on one or another conspiracy to kill him . One was even armed . It was easy to evade him , and the others had cleverer plans than to pellet him in the presence of three hundred loopers . " Do n't worry , " Jason said . " It 's probably nothing . " " I hope you 're right . But I 've never left myself a note before . It must mean something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are between bubbling and the somec ? Nobody remembers . " " I 'm always very smart . " It was the beginning of a hectic few days . Jazz could n't go to his rooms at all  --  there was almost always someone waiting inside to kill him , and Jazz found out about several plots to Ilay traps for him . Finally , things came to a head at a party held 1 , i by a former lifeloop star , Arran Handully , who had given up public fornication in favor of a life of ostentatious gentility . She was deep in one of the more dangerous plots to kill Jazz . Sitting against a wall with no one attempting to talk to him , Jazz had a chance to study the question of why all these murder plots were coming at once . He decided to do a little searching in depth . The mind of Arran Handully was convenient . Jazz had to die  --  it was one of the foremost imperatives in her mind . But why ? Here was where the surprise came : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that Jazz had any Ili ' , olitical power , of course . Just that he symbolized all that Arran hated about Capitol , about the society that had driven the only man she had ever loved to suicide many years before . It was a charming and tragic story , the death of her lover , and Jazz found himself exploring her mind for the sheer pleasure of it , carelessly ignoring the dozen other threats at the party . While he studied her , she came up to him . " Commander Worthing , " she said . " Call me Jazz , " he said , using the charming smile that  | played so well on the loops . Of course , there were a few dozen clandestine loopers taking it all in , and Jazz knew enough to please his public , even when the loop was being taken illegally . " And I 'm Arran . You are something of an unexpected guest , Jazz . We did n't know you 'd be in Capitol until yesterday . It was kind of you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is mine . I have only seen one of your lifeloops , but it was enough to entrance me . " " Oh , which one is that ? " " I forget the name , " Jazz said  --  he never knew it ? " but it was one you did with an old actor named  --  named  --  ah yes , Hamilton Ferlock . " She felt stricken , but showed nothing . Ham Ferlock was the lover who had killed himself when she refused to break character on a twenty-one-day straight-through loop . It was cruel of Jazz to bring him up  --  but then , she was planning to kill him . When ? Why not now ? A servant came with a single goblet of wine . " No matter what we might plan , " said Arran sweetly , " you are the guest of honor at any party you attend . I give you the cup of the night . " She held a silver cup in her hand , and she held it toward his lips , for him to drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblet from the tray and put it to Arran 's lips . Jason took the goblet , but refused the cup . " How can I take such an honor at your hands ? " he asked . " I insist , " she said . " No one deserves it more . " " What a remarkable woman you are , Arran . Such courage ? to dare to poison me at your own party . " If he had been more watchful , he could have avoided this moment . But now the plots were coming together at once . More than a few of the guests at the party were armed ; every exit was watched . The only person here who knew the secret ways out of the room was Arran herself , and they were all keyed to her palm . So he selected the most melodramatic of the would-be assassins , a young clothing designer who had created Arran 's costume for the evening . Jazz stepped toward him . He was the murderer of choice , because he meant to be theatrical about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to introduce himself .  | page deleted  | " Because the most important events in my life happened to you .

Your memories are more present in my mind than my own ! " " And why is that ? " asked Doon . " Because you cared so much . You have such a strong sense of purpose , even when you do n't even know what it is you 're trying to accomplish  --  all your memories mattered to the person who went through the experience .

I look in the mirror and I 'm surprised to see this face . This face is from the loops . This face is Jazz Worthing , but I remember , very clearly , I am Abner Doon ; I am the one who won the confidence of Mother herself and told her when it  | ti ; What did he have to accomplish ? He had been sending out colony ships for centuries now . But the ones that he was sending now , they held his hope . " Mankind is my experiment , " said Jason . " Cut the threads that hind the stars together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . Perhaps thousands of years , until someone comes up with a stardrive that needs no sleep , and then we 'll see what mankind has become in a thousand different cultures . " " That 's my speech , " said Doon . " That 's all right , " Jason said . " You 've been playing puppet with us all . My voice , your words . " " Are you angry ? " " Why me ? Why am I singled out for the joy of being one of your twelve oddities ? " " I do n't know . " " I know you do n't know . I know what you know , and I know what you do n't know . I even know what you do n't know that you do n't know . I can find things in your head that you 've forgotten ever knowing .

" " What do you expect , evolution in a few thousand years ? " " Not evolution . Breeding . " In Doon 's mind , Jason saw himself as Doon saw him . With the eyes pure unflecked blue . Like his father 's eyes , and his ii ii father 's eyes . " The stud for a world of Swipes , is that it ? " " Sire is the more delicate word . " " I was n't raised on a farm . " " You and your family are an anomaly . Your gifts are far more reliable , far more extensive than any known strain of telepathy . Why not see what happens to it in isolation ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a colony full of people who have spent their last few wakings plotting to kill me ? "  | Doon smiled . " It appealed to my sense of proportion . It would be too easy for you to run a normal colony . It would hardly be enough to keep you awake all day . " " It 's kind of you to worry about me being bored . " Doon took Jason by the hair at the back of his neck and drew him down , drew him close , and face to face he said , " Surpass me , Jason . Do more than I have done . " " Is this a contest ? Then why not start even ? Three hundred and thirty-three colonists against one ship 's captain  --  I do n't like the odds . " " With you , " said Doon , " no one is even . " " I do n't want to go . " " Jason , you have no choice . " Jason saw that it was true . Doon had already given out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be arrested the moment he left Doon 's personal protection ; if he tried to escape , where could he hide , when everyone on Capitol knew his face ? " The puppet , " Jason said , " wishes to be free . " " You are free . Stay and die , go and live  --  you have your choice . " " What choice is that ! " " What do you expect , an infinite selection ? To have a choice at all is to be free  --  even when the choice is between two terrible things . Which is most terrible , Jason ? Which do you hate the most ? Then choose the other and be glad . " So Jason chose to go ; Doon had his way again . " It 's not so bad , " Doon said . " Once you 're gone , you wo n't have me manipulating things anymore . " " The only star on the journey through the night , " said Jason . " It will comfort me as my colonists sharpen their knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be without Doon , that was what frightened Jason most . Doon was the foundation of his life , for good or ill ; ever since Doon had found him , Jason had known that nothing could go too wrong in his-life  --  Doon was watching . Now when he stumbled , who would lift him up ? This was freedom after all , Jason realized , because from now on no one would save him from the consequences of his own acts . It was n't freedom that I yearned for , was it ? It was childhood that I wanted , and Doon is barring me from my refuge ; he has  | been my father all these years , and now he 's thrusting me away . " I 'll never forgive you for this , " Jason said . " That 's all right , " Doon said . " I never expected to be loved .

Where are you , Justice ? Working somewhere in silence , as always , listening to us talk , with almost never a word to say yourself ? " You 're not listening , " Jason said .

The answer was no , and so he left , escaped from his world and went to Capitol , a place where everyone looked for someone else to suffer for them . Linkeree was a living sacrifice ; he suffered to expiate the guilt of all who touched him . " Hold tightly when such a vision comes , " said Jason .

No , Jason is not good . as a moment of " She 's right , " Jason said . " It 's the whole meaning of my life , that I inflict suffering on others . " " Did you cause the Day of Pain ? " asked Lared .

"  | page deleted  | He found Claren just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that Claren was no longer controlling his missiles  --  when the first ship blew up , he had lost his means of seeing and therefore controlling his missiles ' flight . They were homing on Jason automatically , which meant their course was absolutely predictable and easy to dodge , except that Jason had wasted too much time looking for the captain 's mind , and while he could avoid one missile , he could not avoid the other . It would strike him . Its high-intensity light would carve through his ship 's armor ; the skin of the ship would peel back from the wound and allow the missile to enter , to plunge into the core of the stardrive and there , gently , explode . A pathetic little explosion , really , but almost anything would upset the delicate balance of impossible forces , and the ship would explode . Jason saw his future in a moment , and in that moment decided that he would prefer any alternative to utter destruction . The missile was too close for him to move his whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slender shaft projecting forward from the massive stardrive , it would not go off like a pent-up star if the missile struck and exploded there . Almost instinctively Jason swung himself into the path of the missile . Somewhere back along the kilometer-long tube behind him , the missile would strike , colonists would die , and Jason found himself hoping that the missile would kill only some of the people , and not harm the all-important animals and seeds and supplies and equipment at all . Impact . The ship shuddered from the distant explosion ; alarms went off on the control panels ; but the explosion was far enough from the stardrive , shielded enough that the drive was able to cope with the disturbance , balance itself before an unstoppable reaction destroyed everything . Alive , thought Jason . Then he set about killing Claren . The enemy remained out of sight behind a planet , but Jason used Claren 's own eyes to track the missiles when they were in the lee of the world , in a place where Claren knew he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intelligence of their own , as if they could read his mind , for wherever he dodged the missiles were already headed for his new course , and in a few moments he was dead . I do n't like knowing my enemy 's name , thought Jason .  | The damage was brutal , but not unsurvivable , or so it seemed at first . The 333 colonists were arranged in three parallel corridors at the back of the payload , each of the three corridors completely shielded from the others , to help protect against the whole colony being wiped out in such an event as this . One corridor was a total loss  --  it had been peeled open to space and the coffins had burst open and erupted with corpses . A second corridor seemed untouched  --  the bodies all lay peacefully within their coffins . But the controls had been seared as the missile canted into the ship , and none of them would ever be revived . Still , the third corridor remained , and 111 people would be enough to start the colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive . They would accomplish less work the first year , but they would have all the more supplies to keep them going for a few more years , till things were up to speed . It was sad that so many had died , but the colony had not been undone . So Jason thought , until he reached the very back of the payload , where the bubbles were stored in a carefully protected environment . That was where the missile had actually exploded . Fourteen bubbles had survived intact . Nine from the corridor that had exploded , four from the corridor whose residents would never wake up , and only one bubble from the surviving colonists . Only one human being left . The others would be incapable of doing anything for themselves , remembering nothing , knowing nothing . How could he deal with 111 adult-sized infants ? What good were people without minds ? He walked back through the corridor of survivors and looked down into the coffins at the people who , though not dead , would never again be themselves . His good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched each coffin and remembered what he had seen within each mind , Hux , Linkeree , Wien , Sara , Ryanno , Mase , I know what you will never know again  --  who you are , what you have done , what you meant to be . Now what are you , if I ever wake you up ? You , Kapock , with your fierce , devoted loves , what lovers will you remember now ? Their names were broken with your bubble , and your past is dead .  | The only bubble that survived belonged to Garol Stipock . Jason studied his face as he lay in his coffin , sleeping . Are you the one that I should waken ? The one person committed to undoing authority in any form ? What sort of ally would you be ? Anyone 's bubble but yours , if the choice had been mine . Your childhood is the one I least needed to keep in living memory . Jason swung the ship through its change of course , but when it was done he did not sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire 's collective wisdom on the art of colonization . All the jobs took dozens of able-bodied women and men to make them work . He plunged deeper into the library , to the books rather than the bubbles , unscrolling them in the air over the control desk , trying to find out what he could teach infants to do , how many he could support by the labor of his own hands . Many times he almost despaired . It could not be done . The high-level technology to farm and manufacture , to create a modern society , required many people with strong specializations . How could he hope to educate a hundred people from infancy to advanced specialties quickly enough that they would n't starve while they waited to grow up ? But gradually , inevitably , the answer came . The modem economy would be impossible , but an older society would not . A life with simple tools that could be made by hand ; a life of fields that could be plowed by people who had not learned their algebra but could drive an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harvest it , to feed myself and a few others . Just a few at a time , until the first ones have developed enough to help me with the next ones . The only drawback was that it would take years . The ship would preserve those he had not yet wakened , but each one he brought out would be utterly unproductive for many years , and during that time would still need an adult 's portion of food , of clothing , of everything , and would require frequent attention and time-consuming care . The colony would never be able to sustain more than a few of these at a time , for the economy would always be marginal , farming as they would with hand tools and animal strength . It would take years , but perhaps , if they learned quickly enough , Jason could leave them from time to time , return to  | the ship and sleep for a year or two , come back just to bring new colonists from the ship , just to check and make sure the colony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully chosen  --  the best people of Capitol , Doon had said . And if a few of them showed exceptional leadership ability , I could bring them aboard the ship and put them under somec again , and preserve them for a time of great need . I could Then Jason realized what he was doing . Planning to create a colony of ignorant peasants , using somec to create an elite class , headed by himself , of people who would withdraw from the world and return to it , years later , without having aged . All that was detestable about somec I am already planning to use again . But only for a time , Jason told himself . Only until the colony is firmly established , only until we 've recovered from the missile that has so undone us all . Then I 'll destroy somec , destroy the whole ship , sink it in the bottom of the sea , and somec will disappear from my planet . It was the only way he could think of to form the colony at all . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from him , especially at the first . But it could be done . Could be done , and might provide an opportunity no one else had ever had . A chance to create a society out of nothing . To create its social institutions , its habits , its beliefs , its rituals , to design them carefully with no need to compromise with old habits , old beliefs . I can make utopia , if I have wit enough ; the power is in my hands , if I can only decide what the perfect society must be . The idea grew , and he began to write of what he thought his world might be , until at last he realized that he was happy again , and excited for the future , more so than at any time before in his life . The enemy 's missile undid all of Doon 's designs , and for the first time in his life Jason was truly on his own , without having to account to Doon or anyone else . If he failed now , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be success for him and for every generation that followed him in his world . And it will be my world , he told himself . By accident I have been made the creator ; I am the one who will put the breath of mind into these men and women ; let us stay in Eden this time , and never fall .  | The house was sealed ; they could all feel the difference , lying in bed in the firelight . The drafts from under the doors were almost gone , so Lared felt no urgency to hide behind the low walls of his truckle bed . The heat sometimes was so great that Sala would cast off her blankets in the night . And still the snow did not fall . The cold whined out of the north , but the only snows were scattered , a few showers that blew into corners and clung to shingles . " When it comes , it 'll hide your head , " said the tinker . " I 've got me a weather sense , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dreams that Justice took from Jason 's memory and put into his mind . But it was different now . For some reason , when he awoke , he could not easily remember what he had dreamed . " I 'm trying , " he told Jason . " I know it had something to do with plowing . You were doing it all wrong or something . You were trying to drive the oxen the way you lead a welltrained horse . You were n't much of a farmer then . Is that it ? " " Of course I was n't much of a farmer , " Jason said . " It was the first time I had seen dirt in my life . " " What 's dirt ? Dirt is dirt . " " I see , " said Jason . " That 's our problem .

How was he supposed to take this seriously ? " These things stay in my mind as magnificent , hard-won discoveries . They come to you as clumsiness in tasks you do every year without thinking . No wonder you forget . " Lared shrugged , though in fact he felt that he had failed somehow . " I ca n't help it . It 's not as if I do n't try to remember . Find another scribe . " " Of course not , " said Jason . " Why do you think we chose you ?

So do n't write it . Do n't write about how I worked as hard and fast as I could to earn an hour to go wandering through the forest , collecting herbs to test in the ship 's lab . Do n't bother with my first tastes of real food , the way I threw u at the taste of bread after so many years of predigested pap made from algae , fish meal , soybeans , and human manure .

Yet what you do  --  herding the trees for harvest , shuttering the windows , making sausage and strawing the ticks ? that is better than any other life I 've lived or seen or even heard about . " " Only because your life 's never depended on it , " Lared said . " Only because you 're still just pretending to be one of us . " " Maybe so , " Jason said . " Just pretending , but I know my  | way around the forest , and I do an ax handle as well as anyone I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean then . You were pretending . You must have learned over the years . " " Yes , " Jason said . " A little . Not much . " He was twisting horsehair into a bowstring , and his fingers were quick and sure . " But I stole the skills from other men , who learned them better than I. I got inside them while they worked , and knew the feel of it without looking . I did n't earn it . I did n't earn anything in my life . I 'm just pretending to be one of you . " " Did I hurt you ? " Lared whispered . " And that 's another way I 'm not like you . You have to ask .

" " It 's just like raising a baby , only they learned a lot quicker and when they kicked you it could really hurt . " " And that 's all ? " Lared asked , disappointed . " It was all the same . It only interests you because you 've never had a child , " Jason said . " People who 've had infants will know . The crying , the demands , the stink , and as they learn to get up and move on their own there 's a lot of destruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got by without the injuries . Till lately . " Jason winced . Lared already knew that Jason bore some responsibility for the Day of Pain , and he took some satisfaction from Jason 's silent confessions of guilt . " Lared , it was the only happy time of my life . Learning to be a farmer , and teaching the children as they learned . Do n't despise it because you were  | born with what I only learned then . Ca n't you write that ? Ca n't you write of a single day ? " " Which day ? " " No day in particular . Any day would do . Not the day I first took Kapock and Sara and Batta from the ship  --  I did n't know what I was getting in for , that autumn ; with the harvest in , I thought the year 's work was done .

Perhaps when I knew that it would succeed . Perhaps a day when I loved them . Find such a day , Justice , and give it to Lared in his dreams . " That afternoon the snow began to fall . The wind blew harder than ever ; they went out only to make sure all the animals were closed in the barns and stables , to make sure everyone in the village knew , and that no children were out in the storm . That took the afternoon , and Lared felt a strange exhilaration in the danger of it , for they had treated him like an adult , letting him go from house to house , trusting him with the lives of some of the families because no one followed after him to be sure he delivered his messages . They have almost decided that I 'm a man , thought Lared . I am almost on my own . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason . The wind was whipping the snow through the innyard , piling it up mountainously against the windward walls of house and barns and forge . Lared looked through the sliding shutter on the door  --  even with so small an opening , the wind stung his eyes and made it hard to see . What he saw was the storm that the tinker had so long promised . There was never a calm in the wind , only an occasional slackening that would let the snow fall slightly downward , instead of seeming to fly straight across , level with the ground . It was impossible to tell how deep the snow was , after a while ; he could see no buildings through the flying snow , had no reference point . Only when the snow drifted up against the door so high that it plugged the shutter hole , only then did he realize that there had never before been such a storm in the village of Flat Harbor . That night Lared went with his father into the cold attic , to see whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay awake in bed a long time , listening to the wind whipping the house , prying at the shutters ; listened to the snow press downward on the house , making the old timbers groan with the weight . He got up twice to put another log on the fire , to make sure the rising heat was stronger than the cold whistling down the chimney , or else the smoke would back into the room and kill them all . At last he slept , and dreamed of a day in the life of Jason Worthing ; he dreamed a good day , the day that Jason knew his colony would work . Jason awoke to the lowing of the cows that needed milking . He had been up three times in the night with the new ones , just brought from the ship . Wien , Hux , and Vary , and they were trouble  --  with the first three on their own a little more , Jason had forgotten how much trouble they could be . Not that they needed nighttime feedings  --  their bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke because they did not know yet how to dream . Their minds were vast caverns , and they easily got lost ; they had no store of images to guide them through the night . So they awoke , and Jason comforted them , calmed them . The cows need milking and I must get up . In a moment I will . How long till these new ones learn ? Jason tried to remember back through the last months , the long winter , the longer spring as he tended Kapock , Sara , and Batta , doing his best to keep them safe , keep them learning , even as he struggled to ready the land , to plant , to grow a crop . But in the late spring they began following after him , imitating him , learning the work ; it had not been long . Eight months and they were walking and talking and helping bear the burden of the work . Jason knew enough of children , though he 'd never had any , to know that they were progressing far faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains that did not depend on currents of electricity kept a pattern ; they learned to walk easily , in a matter of a few months ; bowel and bladder control came soon , mercifully ; their tongues found the tones of speech well enough . Learning their bodies from the inside was not as hard this time as it had been when they were very small . But it was little comfort during the months before they had learned , for  | page deleted  | page deleted  | best . No such loneliness again as when I plowed tractor , and flew in the skiff to place the game ie forest , to stock the lakes with fish that my people was far more free then to come and go as I liked , ) t have to work half so hard as now , but I like this it better , the sound of their voices in my ears , the seeing their joy in learning . they strained the day 's curds and wrapped it and a stone to press it into cheese . Thirty other cheeses wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been right to bring all but a few of the cows ship , despite the trouble that they had caused him fences strong enough to hold them in. one all this , thought Jason . I have come to a meadow nd turned it into a farm , with people and animals ough to keep all alive . And they are learning , they ry know enough to survive without me e promise of future freedom , that they needed him han yesterday . It was also the warning of death . I Jason left Kapock to watch the new ones and went ; dges of the unfenced fields to split last winter 's ice rails . It was hot , exhausting work , but before reed them in from the field they had fenced another ides  --  before summer was gone they could let the the forest to range and root , with a fence to keep he crops . Then the forest would feed them , and it le less drain on the resources of the little farm ; the harvest the forest for them , and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harvest everything . The geese would glean t , so the spilt grains would become roast meat late in . The sheep would eat the stubble and turn it into we 's milk and young lambs for next year 's flock . From the wastewood burning would be used with irned to soap ; the guts of the slaughtered pigs and d become strong threads for binding , or casings for ) nce it had been the daily life of every man and . he world , to turn everything into food or fuel or shelter ; to Jason it was the dawn of creation , and he did was new . Kapock had the supper ready . It was tasteless but  | It was complete . They were a family . " There , " said Lared . " Is it what you wanted ? " " Yes , " said Jason . " I even tried to write it so cheese-making would sound wonderful . Anybody with half a brain can make cheese , you know . And sheep can jump over the kind of fence you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the summer was out , and we raised the fence . " " Human piss makes disgusting soap . " " The books did n't say that . Eventually we started leaching it out of the straw in the barns , the way you do it . We could n't learn everything at once . " " I know , " Lared said . " I 'm just saying  --  you were as much a child as they were . A bunch of big children . Like you were five years old , and they were three , and so that made you like God to them . " " Just like God . " Kapock came to him one night late in autumn , in the darkness when the others were asleep across the room . " Jason , " he said , " did everything come out of the starship ? " He used the word starship but did not know that it meant a thing that could move among the stars . It was just the word for the tall , massive building an hour 's walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me build , " Jason said . He had been too careless in his use of the word everything , for Kapock at once believed that somehow the land and the river and the forest and the sky had come from the starship , too . Jason tried to explain it , but the words were gibberish to Kapock . What did voyage and colony and planet and city and good enough because Jason had n't had to watch the cooking . They were serious about this today  --  twice as much had been accomplished as in any day since Jason took them from the ship . Batta even tried to feed the new ones . Hux spat it on her , and Wien bit the spoon , and she got angry and yelled at them . Kapock told her to be quiet , what did she expect from new ones ? Sara shouted at Kapock to be nice to Batta , she was only trying to help . Jason watched it all and laughed aloud in delight .  | even people mean to him ? Just an incantation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come from the starship , and that Jason had brought the starship to this place . Later I 'll teach him , Jason thought , later he 'll understand more , and I 'll teach him that I 'm not God . " And the new ones , did you make them ? " " No , " Jason said . " I only brought them with me . They were just like me , before we came . They slept all the way here . There are more of them in there , sleeping . " " Wo n't they wake up and be afraid , without you there ? " " No  --  they 're asleep longer than that . The way the river is asleep under the ice . The way the fields are asleep under the snow . They wo n't wake up until I waken them . " Of course not . Nothing wakes till Jason wakes it . Winter comes when Jason wills it . And the people who sleep like the river under ice , they come as Jason calls them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice . The wind let up late in the afternoon . " Just a lull , " said the tinker . " Do n't go far , and do n't go alone . " " Not far , " said Father , " and Lared will come with me . " They went out the south-facing kitchen window , bundled to the eyes so that they climbed like clumsy infants . On the south side the snow was n't quite so deep , though walls of drifted snow flanked the house left and right . The snow was still falling , straight down this time . " Where are we going ? " Lared asked . " To the forge . " It was almost painful , the sound of their footsteps in the silence . For a while , between inn and forge , neither building was visible . Only the unfamiliar landscape of the drifts . Only his father , plowing awkwardly through the waist-deep snow ahead of him . Then the forge became a dark streak in the snow ahead , only the edge of the roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather before , but Father unerringly found the shallowest snow , avoiding the deep drifts that were higher than their heads . A trick of the wind had put a drift in front of the southfacing door of the forge . They forced through it to the wide window in the top of the left-hand door ; it opened inward , and  | the snow gave way , and they lowered themselves inside . " Help me stoke the fire . " It was still alive , from the day before . But what work was so urgent that they had to risk their lives in such a storm ? The answer came when Lared tried to close the window . " The fire ! " said Father . " And leave the window . The others need to see the light . " The others . Lared understood at once . They would make him be a man tonight . It was a great honor , to do it in such a storm as this , provided that the others came . And they did come , two by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot smithy . They left a clear aisle from the open window to the fire of the forge . " We stand , " said Father , " between fire and ice . " " Ice and fire , " said the others . " Will you face the fire , or will you face the ice ? " What did it mean , to face one or the other ? How could he pass a test if he did n't know what the question meant ? So he hesitated . The men murmured . Lared tried to imagine what they meant to do . Fire was Clany , dying in agony ; ice was the snow outside , and no track to guide him home . Give me ice over fire any time . But then he thought again : if I have to face two dangers , which would I rather have before me , and which behind ? I will face what I fear most  --  perhaps that is the test . " Fire , " he said . Ali Many hands took him and faced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew upward . The many hands took the clothing from him , until the fire seared his skin in front , and the wind from the door froze him behind . " In the beginning , " recited Father , " was the age of sleep , when all men and women longed for night and hated all the days of waking . There was among them one with power , who hated sleep , and all his ways were destruction . His name was Doon , and no one knew him until the Day of Waking , when there came a shout from the world of steel : Look at the man who has stolen sleep ! Then the name of Doon was known everywhere , for the sleepers belonged to him , and there was none left who was not forced awake . "  | What would this have meant to me , wondered Lared , if I had n't had Doon 's face in my memory ? All a mystery , all a myth if I had n't known , but I know the truth behind it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you the way his eyes look when he knows you are afraid . I have also been Doon , and evil as he was , somec was worse . " Then , " said Father , " the worlds were lost in the light . They could not find the stars in the sky anymore . For five thousand years they were lost , until men learned to travel against the light , to travel so quickly they could do it without the sleep that Doon had stolen . Then they found each other again , found all the worlds but one , the world known by the holy name . " " Ice and fire , " murmured the other men . " Only here , between the fire and ice , may the name be spoken . " Father reached out and put his thumbs on Lared 's eyes . " Worthing , " he said . Then he whispered , " Say it . " " Worthing , " Lared said . " It was the farthest world , the deepest world , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men awoke . The name of God is Jason . " " Jason , " said the men . " And the world was full of the sons of God . They saw the pain throughout the worlds , the pain of waking , the pain of fire and light , and they said , We will have compassion on the woken , and ease their pain . We are not Jason , so we can not give them sleep , but we are the children of Jason , so we can keep them from the fire . We are Ice , and we will stand at your back , and hold the light at bay . ' " They know the end of the story , Lared realized . They know what became of Jason 's world when he was done . " Now , " said Father , " they have given ice to us . But we remember pain ! Here between the ice and fire , we remem-ber ? " He stopped . The men murmured . " Remember , " someone said . " Pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father said . He was n't reciting anymore . " It is n't the Day of Waking anymore , and it is n't the Day of Ice . It 's the Day of Pain , and I wo n't let it go the old way . " The men were silent . " We saw it coming down the river , what happens when you  | do the ice and fire now ! And I said that day , we will not do it here ! " Lared remembered the man burning alive on the raft . From upriver , where there is still ice in the mountains . " What is supposed to happen now ? " asked Lared . Father looked sick . " We throw you in the fire . In the old days , we were stopped . Our arms would not do it , though we threw with all our might . We did it so we would remember the pain . And to test Worthing . " The men were still wordless . " We saw what happened to Clany ! We know that Worthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Then , " said Clany 's father , " give him ice . " " He chose the fire , " said another man . " Neither one , " said Father . " We did it before because we knew there 'd be no pain . Now we know pain and death . " " Give him ice , " said Clany's-father . " We did not make you speaker so that you could save your son . " " If we keep this alive then all our sons will die ! " Clany 's father was on the edge of weeping  --  or was it the edge of rage ? " We must call them back to us ! We must wake them up ! " " We do not kill our children , even to waken a sleeping god ! " Lared understood it now . Naked , the boy-who-was-to-bea-man was cast into the fire or out the window into the snow . He could see in the faces of the other men that they were n't sure what they wanted . There were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day of Pain was in their faces . And Lared knew his own value in their eyes . A bookish boy and so not trusted ; not strong for his age and so not valued ; the son of the most prosperous man in the village , and so not liked . They do not long for my death , but if someone is to die and wake the children of Jason they are willing for it to be me . And Father is shaming himself to save my life . If they consent to let me live , it will be because my Father begged , and he will never have his pride again in the village . The fire is too much for me , thought Lared . But I can face the snow . " Are the children of Jason in the fire or in the ice ? " he asked .  | He was not supposed to speak , but then nothing was supposed to happen as it had . " They are Ice , " said Hakkel the butcher . " Then I will go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Father . As if in answer , the wind howled outside . The lull in the storm was over . " Tell me what to do , once I 'm outside , " said Lared . No one was sure . The children of Jason had always stopped them before the end . " The words we say , " said Father , " are , Till you sleep in ice . ' ' " In the fire , " said Clany 's father , " we say , Till you wake in flame . ' " " Then I will go until I sleep . " Father put his hand on Lared 's shoulder . " No . I wo n't allow it . " But his eyes aid , I see your courage . " I will go , " Lared said , " until I sleep . " No , said a voice in his mind . I will not save you . I 'm not asking you to , Lared answered silently , knowing he was heard . Do not choose to die , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lared shouted . Their hands reached out to him like dozens of little animals , set to devour him . The hands lifted him , rushed him toward the window , and cast him out into the wind and snow . The snow stung him , and as he struggled to right himself it got in his nose and mouth . He came up gasping and trembling , his legs weak under him from the shock of the cold . What am I doing ? Oh , yes . Going until I sleep . There was enough light from the window to cast his shadow a short way into the snow ? he stepped forward into his shadow . The wind caught him and he fell again , but he got up again and staggered forward . " Enough ! " cried his father , but it was not enough . Until I sleep . Sleep was ice to them , in their story . There would be ice along the edges of the river . Not that far . I can run it in three minutes in summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take the cold and bring it back to them , the way Jason took the twick into his body and brought it out , and lived . From this night , if I live , Jason 's memories wo n't steal me from myself . No one will save you , said a voice in his mind . But he  | page deleted  | the side , turned back again , shaking his head back and forth slowly . " Leave him , " Jason said . " He got the ice for you , he came home asleep , he did all you said for him to do . " The men pulled on their heavy coats and capes , began to glove themselves . " They say your name is Jason , " said Hakkel the butcher . " My name is Jason Worthing , " Jason said . " Did you think Lared 's father lied to you ? " " Are you , " whispered Clany 's father , " God ? " " I 'm not , " said Jason . " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and wondering why you are all such fools as to have gone from yours on a night like this . " They left through the kitchen window , guiding each other home through the darkness .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " Then came a winter like this one , and the snow was so deep in one terrible storm that it cracked the roof beams of some houses , and killed and crippled people in their sleep , and froze others so the sickness crept up their dead legs and arms . The people cried out to John Tinker , Heal us , make us whole . He tried , but there were too many of them all at once . He could n't work fast enough , and even though he saved some , more died . " Why did n't you save my son ! shouted one . Why did n't you save my daughter , my wife , my husband , father , mother , sister , brother  --  and they began to punish him . They punished him by killing birds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he saw the broken birds he was angry . He had taken all the years of their pain , and now they killed the birds because he would not do enough of a miracle to please them . He was so angry that he said , You all can die , I 'm through with you . He bundled himself in his warmest clothes and left . " When he was gone , the storm came again , and pressed on every house , and tore at every shutter until the only house left unbroken by the wind and snow was Worthing Inn . To the inn the survivors came , then sent out parties to search for others who might be trapped in broken houses . But the storm went on , and some of the searching parties disappeared , and the snow was so deep that only the second-story windows could be used as doors , and many of the low houses were covered and they could n't find them . " The fourth day after John Tinker left was the bottom of despair . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , saving only Martin Keeper , who had but the one son , Amos , who was alive . Amos wanted to tell the people , Fools , if you had only been grateful for what Uncle John could do he would not have left , and he would be here to heal the ones with frozen legs and the ones with broken backs . But his father caught the thought before Amos could speak , and bade him be silent . Our house stands , said Martin Keeper , and my son lives , and our eyes are as blue as John Tinker 's eyes . Do we want their rage to fall on us ? " No one looked at Justice 's blue , blue eyes , but everyone saw them .  | " So they held their peace , and on the fourth night John Tinker came back , frozen from wandering in the storm , weary - and silent . He came in and said nothing to them . And they said nothing to him . They just beat him until he fell , and then kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a god who could n't save them from everything . Little Amos watched John Tinker die , and as he grew up and found strange powers within himself , like the power to heal and the power to hear and see through other people 's ears and eyes and the power to remember things that had never happened in his life , Amos kept these powers to himself , and did not use them to help others , even when he knew he could . But he also did not use his powers to get revenge for John Tinker 's death . He had seen the villagers ' memory of John Tinker 's death , and he did not know which was worse , their fear before they killed him , or their shame when he was dead . He did not want to remember either of those feelings as his own , and so he went away to another city , and never saw Worthing again . The end . " Sala broke from her trance . " Did you like my story ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , and people lie to children to make them feel better . Except the tinker . " I do n't like stories where tinkers die , " he said . " That was a joke , " he said . Still no one laughed . That night , when everyone was asleep , Lared lay awake , bundled in blankets in his bed near the fire . He had rested so much these last few days that he could not sleep . He got up and climbed weakly up the stairs , and found Jason and Justice sitting awake in Jason 's room , with a candle for light . He had thought to have to wake them . Why were they still up ? " Did you know I was coming ? " Lared asked . Jason shook his head . " Why did you tell the tale to Sala ? " asked Lared . " It 's from after . It 's from a time when Jason 's descendants were getting much stronger than he was . It must have been hundreds of years . " " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remembers it ? " asked Lared . " Were you still there , Jason ? " " I was under somec , in my ship , at the bottom of the ocean . "  | page deleted  | " What , " said Jason , " and if she walked in from the snow would you kick her to death ? Wait until you understand before you judge . Now go to bed . You had your brush with death the other night , you 've matched my survival in Doon 's garden , that 's what you wanted . No one helped you till you had accomplished what you set out to do . If I had found you and stopped you , or if Justice had warmed you on your way , so that you were never in any danger , what would it have meant , your hour naked in the snow ? " Lared did not say the answer , because it would have felt like surrender . Or apology . Did not say it , but of course they heard it anyway , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , he found his mother awake waiting for him . She did not say a word , just covered him up and went back to bed . I am watched , he thought . Even my mother watches . That was a better answer than the one that Jason and Justice had given him . With that answer , he could sleep . And when he slept , he could dream . It was morning , and Kapock got up early to raise the fire . There was a new smell in the air . The others joked that with sheep around him all the time Kapock could n't smell anything , but it was n't true . He could smell everything , but everything smelled just a little bit like sheep . The new smell was snow , a mere thumb-thick blanket on the ground . It was early . Kapock wondered if that was a sign of a hard or easy winter . What weather would Jason send this year ? he wondered . This was the first winter that Jason was not with them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would riot go , Kapock had said . And if you go , I wish you would make Sara the Mayor . But Jason said , " Sara is best at naming and telling tales , and you are best at knowing what is right and wrong . " It was true that Sara was good at naming . She made Jason tell her again and again about the Star Tower where the Ice People slept  --  she was the one who named it Star Tower . From the stories she decided that the place where they all lived on the north side of the Star River was Heaven City , and the huge river an hour 's walk to the north was Heaven River , because it was as wide as the sky . And when she and Kapock took all  | the sheep across the Star River and lived there with them , Sara said in surprise one day , " We do n't live in Heaven City anymore . We have a new place . " And she promptly named it Sheepside . Sara was good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrong . Jason could not be wrong , but Kapock was never sure what right and wrong were . Sometimes what he thought was right turned out to be right . Today everyone would know that he was right when he told them to make the thatch early , before it was even cold . Now every house was dry and warm inside , except the newest house , the one they were building for Wien and Vary . The early snow would make them all say , You were right . But sometimes he was wrong . He was wrong when he tried to get Batta and Hux to marry . It seemed like the right thing . They were the last two of the first six Ice People  --  Kapock had married Sara and Vary had chosen Wien . Hux thought it was a good idea . But Batta got angry and said , " Jason never told you to marry , did he ? " and Kapock admitted she was right and he was wrong . Jason was never wrong , and so they were all disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowfall would help them trust him again . Kapock remembered four winters in the world . The first was a very dim memory of light too dazzling to see  --  he remembered being afraid because the snow was much too large , and he fled back into the house . The second winter was better , because that was the winter when he and Sara and Batta lived only from the food they had worked to grow themselves , and it was the winter when Jason taught Hux and Wien and Vary to walk and talk . The third winter was the winter when Kapock and Sara first lived in their own house across the Star River from Heaven City . Theirs was the first marriage and theirs was the first new , house , and come summer theirs was the first child born . Sara named him Ciel . But the fourth winter would be this winter , with Sara nursing Ciel and wanting Kapock not to talk so much , and Kapock was afraid . For now there was a problem in Heaven City that he did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when there was a large work to do , all the people worked together . That was how they built new  | houses in two days , and how they harvested and harrowed , how they threshed and thatched , how they cut the winter 's wood and cleared new fields . The tools belonged to all of them together , and so did the hours of the day . So he did not know what to do when Linkeree asked him for an ax and a day . " What for ? " asked Kapock . But Linkeree would not tell him . Kapock never knew how to talk to Linkeree , because Linkeree did not say much , even though he knew how . Linkeree was perhaps the cleverest of the Ice People from the second spring  --  he was the one who made the fish trap in the Star River , and no one taught him how , unless Jason did it secretly . It was Linkeree who first put berries in new wool so that five shirts were made blue . Linkeree was so strange that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not take Jason to tell Kapock that Linkeree was different from the others , and in some ways better , and it made Kapock not want to argue with him , but to trust him to do right . " Take the ax today , " said Kapock , " but tonight you must chop your day 's share of firewood . " Linkeree agreed to that and went . But all day Hux was angry . " We all work together , " he said , over and over . " When Jason was here no one went off to do secret work . " It was true . But it was also true that no one had ever before spoken against a decision of Kapock 's , after it was made . And all day Hux kept saying , " It 's wrong for Linkeree to change everything this way . " Kapock could not argue with him . He , too , felt uneasy with the change . That was five days ago , and each day in the morning Linkeree asked for the ax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work while the others sang and ate and played games in First House , where the New Ones , who were just learning to crawl , would laugh and clap even though they could n't yet speak . It was as if Linkeree were no longer one of them , as if he lived alone . And each day Hux would complain all day . Then at night when Linkeree came back , Hux would he sullen and watch Linkeree , but never said a word of complaint , and Linkeree did n't seem to notice how angry Hux was . But yesterday Hux followed Linkeree into the forest , and last night he told Kapock what he had seen . Linkeree had built a house .  | page deleted  | all take axes , and help you finish the house you 're making ? " Linkeree 's eyes went small . " It 's finished . " " Then why do you need the ax ? " Linkeree looked around and saw that everyone was watching . He fingered the ax . " I 'm cutting the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that next spring . We 'll cut into the forest north of First Field , up the hill . " " I know , " said Linkeree . " I 'll help you with that . May I take the ax ? " " No ! " shouted Hux . Linkeree looked coldly at Hux . " I thought that Kapock was the Mayor . " " It is n't right , " said Hux . " You go off every day to do work that no one needs you to do , and during the day no one sees you , and during the evening no one talks to you . It is n't right . " " I do my share of work , " said Linkeree . " What I do when work is done is mine . " " No , " said Hux . " We 're all one people , Jason said so . " Linkeree stood silent , then handed Kapock the ax . Kapock handed it back . " Why do n't you take us to see the house you built ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , I 'd like to show you . " So they cleared up breakfast and left Reck and Sivel with the New Ones as they followed Linkeree eastward into the forest . Kapock walked in front , with Linkeree . " How did you know I built a house ? " " Hux followed you . " " Hux thinks I am an ox , always to stay in my pen except when I 'm needed to pull . " Kapock shook his head . " Hux likes things to stay the same . " " Is it so bad for me to be alone ? " " I do n't want you to be sad . I 'm sad when I 'm alone . " " I 'm not , " said Linkeree . The house was strange-looking . It was smaller from end to end than the other houses they had built , but it was taller , and there were windows up high , under the roof . And strangest of all was the roof itself . It was n't thatch . It was chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very top . Linkeree saw Kapock looking at the roof . " I only had a little thatch , and so I had to do something to finish it . I think  | page deleted  | page deleted  | when the house I built for myself stands empty ! I built my house , and I 'm tired of waiting . " Kapock told them to be quiet , and said that it was n't right for there to be an empty house . " But I do n't know which of you should have the house . When Jason was here , people only got their own house when they married . He never gave a hosue to someone who was n't going to be a family . " " No one ever built a house alone then , either , " said Linkeree . " That 's true . So this is what I decide . The house belongs to Linkeree because he built it alone . But . It is n't right for one man alone to have a house , when Ryanno and Hux want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So all this winter , until we can build them their own house in the spring , Ryanno and Hux will live in Linkeree 's house , and Linkeree will live with us . " Everyone said that it was fair and right , except Linkeree , and he said nothing . Ryanno and Hux went to Linkeree 's house and shouted from the windows , even the little windows high up , but no one was quite as happy as usual because they knew it was n't their true house . That night , Linkeree set his house on fire , and then shouted to wake up Hux and Ryanno so they could run outside . " No one will live in the house I built l2ut me ! " shouted Linkeree , and then he ran off into the snow . Hux and Ryanno walked barefoot in the snow to get back to First House , and Batta , who had learned the rules of healing , cut off two of Ryanno 's toes and one of Hux 's fingers , to save their lives . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was gone in the snow . I How could a man live alone in the snow , with no house and no friend ? They were all sure that Linkeree would die . Hux raged that he should die , because of the finger he lost and the toes that Ryanno lost . But Batta said , " A toe is not a life , " and in the morning she , too , was gone , with a pan and a dozen potatoes and two blankets made of blue wool . Kapock was afraid now . Jason would come back and he would say , " How are the people that I left in your care ? " And Kapock would answer , " All are well except Hux and Ryanno ,  | who lost their toes and finger , and Linkeree and Batta , who ran off and died together in the snow . " He could n't bear to let things be that way . The toes and finger he could n't help now . But Batta and Linkeree he could . He left Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and he went off with a saw in his hand and a coil of woolen twine around his shoulder and a bag of bread and a cheese slung on his back . " If you die too , how will that help us ? " Sara asked , holding Ciel up so Kapock would remember his child . " I would rather die than have to tell Jason that I let Linkeree and Batta die . " So Kapock searched in the forest for three days before he found them , living in a cold wattle-and-daub shelter leaning against a hill . " We 're married , " they said , but they were cold and hungry . He gave them some of his cheese and bread , and then together they chose a place on firm ground , but in the shelter of a hill , and they cut switches from a tree and swept away the snow from a section of ground , and all afternoon Kapock and Linkeree and Batta felled and split logs . With the saw Linkeree cut shingles , and in three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was the best they could do in the cold , and it was warm and dry enough inside . " This house belongs to me as much as you , " Kapock said when it was done . " That 's true , " said Batta . " I will give you my share of this house , if you will build Hux the same house you burned . The very house , and you must build it alone . Before you do one thing to make this house larger , you must build a fine house for Hux . " " I can only do that in the spring , " said Linkeree . " The work 's too fine to hurry it , or do it on soft ground in the snow . " " In the spring is soon enough . " Then Kapock went home , and all that winter he and Sara and Ciel lived in First House , with the New Ones , while Hux and Ryanno- lived in Kapock and Sara 's own house across the river . Every day Kapock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep , but whenever Hux and Ryanno wanted to give back their house , Kapock said no  --  while Linkeree and Batta had a house of their own , Ryanno and Hux would also have a house . Sara saw the wisdom of what Kapock was trying  | to do , and so she did not complain . And there was peace . Jason had not said when he would return . For a long time Kapock hoped for him every day . But spring came , and fields were plowed and planted , and then summer , and trees were felled and houses built . It was near autumn when Jason came again . It was early morning , and Kapock and the dogs and Dor , one of last year 's New Ones , were taking the sheep to a meadow in the hills southwest of Heaven City . Dor , who knew the way , was leading . Kapock brought up the rear , crook in hand , watching for stragglers . The sheep were drinking at a brook when he heard footsteps behind him . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kapock whispered . Jason smiled and touched him on the shoulder . " I 've seen all that happened , all that was important enough for anyone to remember . And you 've done well , Kapock . The quarrel between Linkeree and Hux could have destroyed Heaven City . " " I was afraid that everything I did was wrong . " " Everything you did was right , or as right as anyone could hope for . " " But I did n't know . I was n't sure . " " No one ever is . You did what felt right to you . It 's all we ever do . The way I did when I named you Mayor . It worked pretty well for both of us , did n't it ? " Kapock did not know what to say . " Yesterday my Ciel spoke . He called me by name . It 's like you said , Jason  --  the little ones we make are n't as strong as your Ice People , but they learn , and they grow , just like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " Jason smiled . " Bring all the people to the west end of First Field , under the arm of Star Tower , fourteen days from today . I 'll come then , and bring New Ones . " " Everyone will be glad . " And then , " Will you stay ? " Stay , so I can be Kapock the shepherd again , instead of Kapock the Mayor . " I will not , " Jason said . " I 'll never stay again . A few days , a few weeks if there 's a need , but never longer than that . But I 'll come every year on the same day , for a few more years at least , to bring New Ones . " " Do I have to be Mayor forever ? " asked Kapock.  | " No , Kapock . There 'll come a time , not too many years from now , when I 'll take you with me into the Star Tower , and leave someone else as Mayor . Someone else who does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday , later , I 'll bring you back , not a day older than you were before , and you 'll see how the world has changed while you slept . " " I 'll be Ice again ? " " You 'll be Ice again , " said Jason . " And Sara ? And Ciel ? " " If they earn it , " said Jason . " Sara will . And Ciel , I 'll do my best with Ciel ? " " Enough . Your sheep are waiting . And Dor will wonder who I am . I do n't think that he remembers me . " " Fourteen days , " said Kapock . " They 'll be there , all of them . There are nine houses now , and four children born , and five women growing big . Sara again , she 's one of them ? " " I know all that , " Jason said . " Good-bye . " He walked away , and left Kapock with the sheep and the dogs and Dor . Dor 's eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " He talked to you . " Kapock nodded . " Let 's get the sheep to the hills , Dor . " And - he told him tales of Jason all the way . Lared wrote the story as he sat in bed , with the parchment on a board on his lap . Everyone in the house saw him writing , and the women asked him to read it aloud . It was not really about Jason , and Lared saw no harm in it , and so he read the tale . Before the end they all took sides , some saying that it was Hux in the right , and some saying that it was Linkeree . When it was done , Sala asked , " Why did Kapock have to lose his house ? He and Sara did n't do anything wrong at all . " Mother answered , " When you love people , you do whatever it takes to make them happy . " If that is true , thought Lared , why does n't Justice protect us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? When Father came in from tending the animals , they told him the story , too , and then asked him the question Sala had asked . " He paid the price , " Father said . " Someone has to pay  | page deleted  | They set out at first light , twenty-two men with eleven teams of horses pulling sledges . Lared led the way , and this year , for the first time since he had begun to mark the trees , he was counted in the total of men . He had marked forty-four trees , four for each team . And Father rode beside him on the foremost team . One by one they came to the trees that Lared had marked . Two men with axes and saws stopped at the fourth tree . They would cut it , then haul it back to the third tree , cut that and go back to the second , then to the first , and then home , each . team  --  with the surest foresters and the strongest horses saved for last , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Lared and Father would be last this time . They both had earned it . Only six of them were still together at nightfall , when they had to make camp . They had brought wattles and poles on the sledges , enough to make a stable for the horses and a large hut for the men . It took only half an hour to set it up  --  they built P the same structure every year , and they practiced doing it in the common field at Midsummer . " Pretty proud of yourself , " said Jason . " Oh , did I startle you ? " Lared looked up . " You would n't know what it feels like . No one ever startled you in your life . " " Every now and then . " " What am I supposed to be proud of myself about ? " " Riding at the head of the company . And the way you pointed out the weakening at the top of the mast tree , so they agreed that you had to cut it this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast ever to float down the river  --  you were magnificent . " " Do n't mock me. "  | " I was n't . You earned it . Like my first solo in a cruiser . Rites of passage . I 've lived a long time , that 's all , and yet I still watch the young ones pass through into responsibility , before they realize that irresponsibility was better , and I ca n't help but love them for it . There 's no better moment in your life . " " It was , " Lared said , " until you pointed it out . " " Shall I show you how you looked ? " " What do you mean ? " In a moment he saw it before his eyes , supplanting his own vision : himself as Jason had seen him earlier in the day , talking oh-so-gravely with the older men . Only now he saw the halfveiled smiles . All very good-natured  --  they liked him  --  but still patronizing . He was still a boy pretending to be a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked away from Jason in the thickening darkness . " I thought you 'd had enough of wandering off in the snow , " Jason called . " You and Justice ! You with your visions ! Have you seen yourselves ! " " Always , " said Jason , walking toward him . " What do you gain from it ? Making me ashamed ? " " Now look at it again . " " No . " But protest was meaningless . Again came a vision , but this time it was his own memory , with the way he felt at the time . Riding at the head of the company , talking business with his father , explaining his decisions about each tree to the listening men . Only now there were his present bitterness and shame like tinted glass , coloring everything darker . He felt again the happiness he had felt all day . Only now he thought himself a fool , and was angry . " Stop it ! " he shouted . " Lared ! " His father 's voice rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , Father ! " Lared called back to him . " Come on back , then . It 's getting dark , if you ca n't see it ! " Lared could not answer , for again Justice put a vision in his eyes . The same memories of the same day , but this time not through Jason 's eyes , nor through his own , but rather himself the way his father saw him . Constantly through the day as  | Lared spoke , Father saw that he was foolish , but also remembered him younger , remembered him as a child ; remembered , too , himself on such a day . Remembered the boy who clung numbly to a chip of river ice , for the sake of honor or faith or manhood . The love and admiration were so intense that when the vision at last faded Lared 's eyes were filled with tears . He had never been a father , but he remembered fatherhood , and he ached for a little child that was gone forever , that he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing to me ? " he whispered . A branch cracked overhead , and snow dribbled down near them . " This is the last time , " Jason answered . The same scenes , in his own memory again . Only this time he saw himself more clearly than before . He no longer believed the happiness , of course , but neither did he believe the scorn . He saw himself as if from the distance of years . He saw that he was young , but did not hold it against himself . He saw also that he was happy , but he did not wish that he still felt that way . He remembered too well the pain of discovering how foolish he had been . He saw himself more as Father had seen him , as a boy on a path of years , echoing childhood with every move , promising manhood also . And that combination of foolish happiness , shame , and love  --  meant something . Until then , the memories had meant nothing . But these visions of today had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And yet Lared could not think why this day should be so important , after all . Jason leaned close to him , held him by the shoulders , almost in an embrace . " Were you happy before ? " " Before what ? " " Before we showed you how it really was ? " " Yes . I was happy . " And the remembered happiness was somehow stronger than the happiness itself had been . " And then what ? " " Angry . Ashamed . " Was it the pain , then , that made the joy so strong ? Was that Jason 's lesson ? Truth or not , Lared was not grateful . He did not like being carved into whatever shape suited Jason 's purpose at the time , ' jammed in place and wedged like the handle of an ax . " Now , Lared . What is it that you feel now ? " asked Jason .  | I 've been wounded , and you 're using the bloody place to teach me , and if that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no gods at all . " I do n't want you near me . " He ran from Jason toward the light of the cookfire . As he ran , Justice spoke to him comfortingly in his mind . Joy , Lared . What you feel is joy . The happiness , the pain , the love . All at once . Remember it . Get out of my mind ! Lared screamed inside himself . But he lay awake remembering it . " Lared , " said Father , lying beside him . " We were all proud of you today . " Lared did not want to be lied to , and he knew the truth . " The others laughed at me . " Father did not answer at once . " With affection , yes . They like you . " A longer silence . " I did n't laugh at you . " " I chose the right trees . " " Yes , Lared . " " Then why did they laugh ? " " Because you were so proud of the first horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They laughed because I was strutting like a cock in thechickenyard . " " Yes , " said Father . " What are you , God ? Must everyone always take you seriously ? " It sounded harsh , but Father 's hand on his arm told him that it was meant kindly . " Like I said , Lareled . I was proud of you today . " Lared felt Jason 's blue eyes burning inside his mind . I am alone with my father , Jason . Ca n't I be alone with him ? He felt Justice haunting him , ready to put a veil across his sight and make him see whatever dream she chose . Because you give them to me , Justice , have I forgotten how to dream ? What are you , Jason ? God , that 's what you are . Going into and out of your starship , never aging as your people lived and died . A select few you took with you , and they , too , passed the time and stayed young . Kapock was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , left little ones behind . You gave them great prestige , and cut them off from all that they loved . They worshiped you , Jason Worthing , and what did they gain from it ? Anyone can tell a lie to children , and win their love . It worked with me.  | Ah , whispered Justice in his mind . So you do n't like the way that they believed in Jason . You prefer doubt . You prefer those who know what Jason really is . Lared remembered the one bubble that had been preserved . Garol Stipock . The one man who could remember Capitol , who knew that Jazz Worthing was mortal . A man who had once sought to prove it . You gave him his memory ? What do you do with another man 's past ? Jason rocked the case of Stipock 's bubble in his hands . All of Stipock 's past in his hands , and Stipock 's living body hot with somec in the corridor , the last of the original colonists , waiting to be wakened . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , how I would deal with three hundred people who wanted to murder me . I had ideas , I remember . Keep them off balance , quarreling with each other , reliant on me for any kind of stability at all . I did n't need to do it after all . Now , instead of keeping them disturbed , I keep the peace . I find the best of them , the wisest , they serve a few years as Mayor and then I bring them here , I save them for when they 're needed next . I never asked them to think of me as God , but the honor it gives to those I take into the ship makes Heaven City a safe and stable people . Sixty years so far , safe . And stagnant . He tossed the bubble gently into the air , caught it . Stipock was n't one of the haters . He had n't wished for my blood , he only wanted what Door ' wanted : the breaking of the game . Stipock was one who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . I could not have created a society to gall him more than this one , with their naive faith , their willing compliance with authority . Why do you obey the Mayor ? he would ask . Because Jason is n't here , they would answer . Well , why do you obey Jason ? he would ask . Because he was the first . Because he made us . Because everything obeys Jason . Will you tell them , Stipock ? Will you teach them all the ways of Capitol ? Teach them about stars and planets , bending light and gravity ? No , you 're not such a fool as to think you can build utter ignorance into true science . You 'll see the oxen and the wooden plows , the brasswork and the tin , the faith in  | page deleted  | page deleted  | It was almost sunrise when they brought the boat to shore . Stipock was almost naked and dripping wet and a little cold , and the others laughed at him as he shivered , but it was exhilarated laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . Stipock had made a hobby of sailing on the great indoor lake of Sector ff3L , and it felt good to swim again , even if the river was a little silty . But it was not swimming and boating again that pleased him . The joy of it was its firstness : never before had a boat rested on the waters of this world ; never before had these children seen a human being swim . " You will teach us ! " Dilna demanded . " If I 'm going out on this boat again I want to know how to swim ! " " If I can find time between road-building and shingle-cutting and answering your ridiculous questions all the time ? " Stipock said . Wix laughed at him . " If we did n't ask questions you 'd talk anyway . You 're a talker , Stipock . " " But Hoom here is the only real listener . " Hoom smiled but said nothing . Just sat by the boat , holding the wood that he himself had worked and shaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were few carpenters to match Hoom 's handwork . He was slow , but when he was finished the boat was tight as a barrel , and scarcely needed the coat of gum they gave it . Stipock had thought of starting with a canoe , but it was too easy to spill from one , and the young ones could n't swim . If he had n't had Hoom as a carpenter , he could n't have done it . " Well , " said Dilna , " when do we hold a public demonstra-tion ? " " Today , " said Wix . " Right now , Let 's call the whole of Heaven City to see us ride on the water like a woodchip . " Dilna poked at the boat with her toe . " It is a woodchip . " She grinned at Hoom to show him that she meant no harm by it . He smiled back . Stipock enjoyed seeing how much he was in love with her . It was one of the best things about being with young people  --  everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still young enough to believe in the future . No one had ever plucked them up from their life , thrown them  | into a colony ship , and sent them out to the edge of the universe in the power of a starship pilot who liked the idea of being God . " I think we should wait to show everybody , " Stipock said . " I 'm supposed to meet with Noyock this morning . Let me talk to him about it . Besides , it is n't enough just to go out on the water with it . We have to go somewhere . The other side , I think . Your father should go with us , Hoom . " Why did Hoom look alarmed ? " I do n't think so , " he said . " Imagine meadowlands that went on forever . Room for millions of cattle to graze . " " Millions , " said Dilna . " That 's what I like best about you , Stipock . You always think small . " Then , as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get home now . It 's morning , and people will wonder where we are . " Stipock left first , with Wix , because he could tell Hoom wanted to hang back and be alone with Dilna for a while . Wix took his leave as they crested Noyock 's hill , and went on down into the city . Stipock walked up the dirt road to the house where Mayor Noyock lived . It was hard for Stipock to take the Mayor seriously . He had seen him too often before , on Capitol , Jazz Worthing 's oily , ubiquitous agent , getting into every loop , as if by appearing often he could become more than ten percent of a man . Everything was different here , of course . Hop Noyock had never been sycophant or a parasite , as far as he remembered , anyway . Stipock had seen the wound in the ship , the damaged coffins , the ruined bubbles . He knew that it meant a fresh start for everyone , to come into the world empty-minded again . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in every part of the colony , Jason 's mind was imprinted all over so-called Heaven City . Jazz Worthing , the starship pilot , had finally got what he longed for : absolute worship by backward , debased peasants . He had made no effort at all to teach them what the human mind was capable of . What the universe itself was like . Just a mumbo-jumbo of religion , like an ancient emperor trying to convince his people that he was a god . Only Jason had done much better than most . He had the miracles to prove it . Only Stipock knew that his apparent agelessness was nothing but somec , that his wisdom was noth- ing but a decent education in Capitol 's school system , that the miracles he wrought were all machinery hidden in the Star Tower  --  no , the colony ship ; they 've got me saying it , too . Stipock knew what was in store for him . Jason had put his memory in place and let him come into the colony unfettered . Stipock could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jazz Worthing still needed an audience , still needed the people of Capitol to worship him . Stipock was the only person available to watch and then applaud . You 'll get damn little cheering out of me , he told himself with anticipation . I 've spent my life undoing pompous , dogmatic ; self-serving tyrants like you , and I 'll do it again . I 'll do it the way I 've done it every time before : with the truth . It 's the one thing that the Jazz Worthings of the universe ca n't bear for long . , Stipock was not naive . He knew what he was up against . Sixty years of Jason 's lies and miracles , his power and authority had made this a rigid , powerful theocracy , with the Mayor like Jason 's archangel standing guard at the tree of life . Jason still has the power of the rulers of Capitol : he still controls somec , and if he wishes he can leave me behind as he and his chosen servants skip like stones across the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his own work of undoing . I will unweave your little fabric , Jazz , I will ravel it out before you wake again . Three years you 've given me , or so you said , before you 'll come again . See what I can do in that amount of time . Jason had inadvertently given him a powerful tool . Because Stipock was the last of the New Ones , because he had let Stipock come from the ship walking and talking , with a store of knowledge and a vocabulary as elevated above the rest of the colony as Jason 's own , some of Jason 's aura of divinity had fallen upon Stipock . The most pathetically ardent of Jason 's worshippers hardly dared argue openly with Stipock , his prestige was so high . It made him free . Till now . No doubt Noyock had called for him today to try to silence him . Well , Noyock , you can try . But already I have wakened enough people that your authority is shaken , and any punishment you try to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have realized the backwardness of Heaven City . I 've taken the young people out on the water and shown  | them how to swim . They wo n't be trapped here between rivers anymore . Still , Stipock was honest enough to admit to himself as he knocked at the door of Noyock 's house that he was afraid . Noyock was not just a creature of Jason 's shared prestige . It was n't just the office of Mayor that made him powerful . Noyock had been Mayor before , for seven years , and on his own he had done much to change and improve the life of Heaven City . He was the one who had started the little villages miles away ; he was the one who had divided up the land so each family farmed their own , and the common work was limited to road-making , lumbering , and harvest . The result had been much greater prosperity , a spurt of growth , and now , in his second term as Mayor , Noyock was still energetic , a good leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth having . Including Stipock . Stipock 's contempt for him as Jazz 's agent did not make him blind to the fact that Noyock was a benevolent despot . Unfortunately , benevolent despots were the worst kind : it was so much harder to convince people they ought to get rid of them . The door opened . It was Aven , Noyock 's son . He greeted Stipock coldly . " Come in . " " Thank you , Aven . How are things going ? " " Your hair is wet , " Aven said . " It was in water , " Stipock answered . Aven studied him for a measured moment . " You 've built your boat , have n't you ? " " I 'm not a carpenter , " Stipock said . It was a stupid thing to say , he realized , for it instantly incriminated Aven 's son . There was no better carpenter in Heaven City than Hoom . And from the anger in Aven 's face , Stipock realized Hoom had lied when he said his father did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing in his rage . " Because my father built this house many years ago , " said Aven , " before Jason took him into the Star Tower , I allow him to use two rooms upstairs to conduct his business as Mayor . That means I must permit any sort of scum to come into my house  --  but only long enough to walk up the stairs and into the Mayor 's office . " " Things are going well for me , too , " Stipock answered . He  | waved cheerfully at Aven as he went up the stairs . Hoom was right  --  his father was as pleasant company as a boar in the woods . Noyock 's office door was open , and Stipock could see him , bent over a table , writing on a piece of sheepskin . Stipock thought of a paper mill , using rag and pulp , and decided there was n't need yet for so much paper ; nor were there people enough to spare from other work for such a task . Still , it might be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive , and only one fair-sized sheet of it from each animal killed . " Oh , Stipock , " said Noyock . " You should have said something . " " It 's all right . I was thinking . " Noyock ushered him into the room . Stipock glanced at what Noyock had been writing . " The history , " Noyock said . " Every month I take a few days to write what happened that was important . " " What you thought was important . " " Well , of course . How can I write what you thought was important ? I 'm not you . Jason settled that years ago  --  anyone who wants to can write a history . A few of them have . It 's always interesting to compare them . It 's like we lived in different worlds . But the Mayor usually knows more of what 's going on . After all , what 's important is usually a problem , and the problems always end up coming to the Mayor . It 's been that way since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know about . " " Fewer than you think , " said Noyock . " For instance , I know that you 've been telling the children that Jason should n't choose the Mayor , that everyone ought to vote on it . " " Yes , I 've said that . " " I 've been giving that a lot of thought . And it occurs to me that if we did that , we 'd usually choose someone that we liked . The trouble is , the Mayor has to make a lot of decisions that no one likes . Then no one will want him to be Mayor anymore , and so either we 'd keep changing Mayors or we 'd choose Mayors who govern very badly but never offend anybody . Now , before you start arguing with me , Stipock , let me tell you that those are just my thoughts of the moment , and I wonder  | if you 'd be kind enough to think about them at least as long as I thought about your ideas before trying to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help smiling back . " You 're a clever bastard , you know . " Noyock raised an eyebrow . " Bastard ? I wish you and Jason would write down all these words that none of the rest of us knows , so we can learn them . " " It 's just as well . A lot of them are n't worth knowing . " Noyock leaned back in his chair . " Stipock , I 've been very interested in what you 've done in the six months since you 've been here . You work hard at every task that 's been put to you . No one calls you lazy , and no one calls you a fool . But I keep hearing complaints about you . Mostly from the older people . They 're concerned because of the things that you 've been teaching their children . " " I wo n't stop , " Stipock said . " Oh , I do n't want you to stop , " said Noyock . " You do n't ? " asked Stipock , surprised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they 'll stop complaining about it . I want you to be a teacher all the time . I want it to be your work , the way the sheep are Ravvy 's and the cattle are Aven 's . I 've calculated that we 'll give you a plot of land and require your students to farm it for you . They 'll pay in sweat for what you put into their heads . " Stipock was genuinely surprised  --  and puzzled . " You want me to teach them ? Do you have any notion of what I say ? " " Oh , yes . You tell them how the world is a spinning globe , and the sun is a star . You tell them how sickness is the work of tiny animals , how the brain is the seat of the mind , and your story that Jason is only one of many who drive Star Towers through the sky has filled the children 's minds with interesting speculations about what other worlds might be like , with all the miracles you talk about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not afraid of what will happen with the children thinking things that none of us have ever thought before . I think it 's more to be encouraged than discouraged . But that is n't why I want you to be our teacher . " " Why , then ? " " You know things that will solve problems for us . You 've talked of a water-powered mill to grind the grain  --  I want to  | build it , and I want you to teach some of the children the principles behind it so we can make more . You 've talked of boats , so water-tight that we could cross the Great River and sail out to the ocean . " " You know about the ocean ? " " Of course . " " The children do n't . " " Those of us who have been in the Star Tower  --  Jason shows us the maps of the world , where the grasslands are , the forests , the metals hidden in the earth , the great rivers and the seas . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , he 's shown us the coffins where the Ice People sleep . He showed me you , in fact , and warned me he might waken you this time . " " But you 've told no one about it . " " There 's been no need . " " But  --  they do n't even know the shape and size of the world they live on . " " If they ask , I tell them . No one asks . " " Why should they ask ? No one knows that you know . " " Well , you have n't kept your knowledge a secret , and that 's all that matters now . Build your boats , Stipock , and take the children who adore you across the river . I 'll help you  --  I can keep the frightened parents at bay . Start a new village there , with a river that only those who 've learned to drive your boats can cross , and give these children a chance to become men and women without their parents breathing down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected . He had looked for a reprimand ; he had come steeled for a quarrel . " Do n't you realize how that will dilute your power , Noyock ? " Noyock nodded gravely . " I know very well . But Heaven City is growing larger all the time . Jason told me to separate my work and give bits of it to the best men and women for the job . I 've put Worinn in charge of the building of roads , and he 's doing well . Young Dilna is , a master of tools , since everyone knows she does fine metalwork better than anybody else . Poritil is harvestmaster and keeper of the grain ? " " And doing well . I did n't realize how new they were . I thought Jason set the system up . " " He suggested it . I only carried it out . But you  --  he did n't tell me what to do with you . "  | " But you said he warned you . " " That the children would follow you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except ? " " That the peace and law of Heaven City must be maintained . " " And what does that mean ? " " That means that when you take the children across the river , Stipock , you will not teach them to disobey the law . I know more about the life of the Ice People than you think . Jason told us how they thought nothing of marriage , and coupled where they pleased , and killed their children ? " " I can see he gave you a neutral picture of it ? " " We need our sons and daughters , Stipock . I was here when there were only fifteen of us , besides Jason . I was here when the first babies grew , before they were ever men and women . Now there are nearly a thousand . Now there are people who can spend all their working time at the forge or at the loom , so that those who are best at a job do n't have to drop their work to weed the fields or shear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires . We do not need two or three or four separate cities , each one doing fpr itself what we could all do more easily together . We are too few for that . And Jason warned meof another thing . " " What was that ? " Stipock expected it to be something about him . " War . Do you know the word ? " Stipock smiled tightly . " It was Jason 's main line of work . " " The closest we 've come to it was the burning of Linkeree 's house , back in the first year of Kapock . Jason told me stories of what it could be like . I believe him . " " So do I. " " The seeds are there , Stipock . The seeds of war are in this house . My grandson Hoom hates his father , and my son Aven has done his best to earn that hate . Look among the young ones , Stipock . Find the best of them . Not a hot-headed fool , like Billin . Perhaps Coren , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not quick to anger . Or Hoom himself , though I fear he 's learned too much of bitterness , and not enough of love . Before you take the children across the river , come to me and we 'll name a Little Mayor for the other side . "  | " No . " Noyock smiled . " You have another suggestion ? " " On the other side , if the new town is to be settled by the people who believe in me  --  and they are n't children , Noyock , not anymore  --  then we 'll choose our leader our way . " " Interesting . Shall we compromise ? Let 's choose a Little Mayor for the first year , and after that year we can let the people choose a leader by their own voice . " " I knew you before , Noyock , knew who you were , at Ieast . " " I do n't want to hear about it . I have trouble enough being who I am now , without being troubled with thoughts of who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mean to dwell on it . I just wanted to tell you ? I never would have believed that you were the same man . Whatever else might be wrong with the way that Jason has things going here , it 's made a good man out of Hop Noyock . " " But you , Stipock , you are the same man you were before . " Stipock grinned . " And no better , is that it ? Well , I 'm good enough for this  --  when the man in power is as flexible as you , it 's hard to hate you . But I can promise you that if you let me do what you yourself have just proposed , in ten years the office of Mayor will be elected , and the laws will be made by the people of this place , and not by the dictates of a one-man judge and king and legislator . " Noyock laughed and shook his head . " Not only do you use words I 've never heard of before , but you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't overreach yourself , Stipock . Even Jason can not see the future . " But Stipock knew that change would come , and knew that he was giving shape to that change already . Noyock was giving it to him as a gift . A town of his own , with a river between his people and the Mayor ; authority to teach as he saw fit , and begin to modernize this backward place ; and a promise of democracy to come . I 'll hold him to that , thought Stipock . And when Jason comes back , he 'll see what a little dose of truth and freedom can do , even to the medieval society he created . He took his leave of Noyock and opened the door to leave . Downstairs he could hear shouting . " Will you do what I forbid ? " And the sound of a blow . " Will you do what I forbid ? "  | Silence . And another blow . A crash of chairs falling . " I ask you , boy ! Will you do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge from his office and close the door . " I think your son is beating your grandson , Noyock . " " And I think you know the cause of it , " said Noyock . Stipock turned and answered abruptly . " Hoorn told me that he had consent ! " " Are you so wise , Stipock , and yet you ca n't tell from his face when a boy is lying ? No , do n't go downstairs . Not yet . It 's between father and son . " From downstairs : " Will you do what I forbid ? Answer , Hoorn ! " Esten , Aven 's wife , began to plead with her husband to stop hitting the boy . " He 's beating the boy . Is that part of what parents are allowed to do ? " " If the child is small , we take it away to save its life . But Hoom is old enough that he ca n't be beaten without his own consent . Listen  --  he 's telling his mother to leave them alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer me ! " From downstairs Hoom cried out in pain . " Yes , Father , I will do what you forbid ! I will sail on the river , I will go where I like , you were a fool to forbid it ? " " What do you call me ! What do you ? " " No ! Do n't touch me again , Father ! You 've beaten me for the last time ! " " Oh , do you think you 're a match for me ? " Noyock brushed passed Stipock and headed down the stairs . " Now we step in , " he murmured as he passed . Stipock followed him . They got there just as Aven picked up a broken chair leg and began advancing on his son , who stood defiantly in a corner . " Enough , " said Noyock . Aven stopped . " It 's none of your affair , Father . " It seemed somehow pathetic that this fifty-year-old man called Noyock , who was fifteen years younger in appearance , Father . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , "
