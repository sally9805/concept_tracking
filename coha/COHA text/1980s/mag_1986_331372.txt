He became an instant hero to both Hawaiians and Japanese Americans last January as the first member of either group to fly in space . Ellison Onizuka was a mission specialist on last year 's classified military flight of Discovery , but he was perhaps most appreciated among colleagues for his gentle , unassuming manner .
