txt THE ORGANIZATION of many small businesses is simple : The owner is the boss and makes all the decisions . But if the company grows , that style of management usually wo n't work ; the owner will have to share authority . tmtrepreneurs seldom do that easily . " Surrendering some control is probably the most difficult step for an owner , " says Calvin Kent , director of the Baylor University Center for Private Enterprise . Paul McClinton resisted delegating au thonty for years . He had to do it eventually for the sake of his business . " It got to the point where I could n't do it all , " he says . " The business could n't grow unless I let my managers make decisions on their own . " Mr. McClinton owns two Waco , Texas , firms . Automatic Chef Co. is a vending-machine and mass-feeding company with plants in three Texas towns . Texas Cattle Co. is a barbecued-meat processor that Mr. McClinton believes has unlimited potential . Combined sales of the enterprises exceeded $10 million last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he began releasing some of the reins three years ago . Today , managers of the three Automatic Chef plants make most management decisions on their own . " It 's worked excellently , " Mr. McClinton says . " We get a lot more productivity now . " THE PERSON WHO STARTS the business may be the worst of managers when it begins to grow . " Sometimes the kind of behavior that enables a person to start a company is the kind of behavior that makes it fall later on , " says Dan Ciampa , vice president of Rath &; Strong , Lexington , Mass. , management consultants . Entrepreneurial personalities , he says , often ca n't share authority with others . Wayne Swearingen knows about that . He was a founder eight years ago of Swearingen Co. , a Dallas real estate firm that now has 160 employes . Two months ago , he finally relinquished the chief executive 's chair . " The thing is , I know the place wo n't run the way it would if I was in charge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equipment Co. to bring in professional managers . The 41-year-old Long Island City , N.Y. , company had grown beyond the owners ' managerial skills . " We had built a strong sales company , but we needed better financial controls , " says Stephen Gutman , president and 38-year-old son of the founder . The company sells and services materials-handling equipment , including forklift trucks and conveyors . Annual sales are about S20 million . Dierckx hired a certified public accountant from a big accounting firm four years ago and made him financial vice president with a starting salary of 550,000 plus bonuses based on performance . An industrial engineer was lured from Phelps Dodge Corp . to be production vice president . THESE EXECUTIVES . Mr. Gutman says , " brought us professional management . Now we have a complete budgeting process . We are concentrating on areas with the greatest profit potentials . Our return on sales is higher . " Mr. Ciampa , the consultant , had been working with Mr. Gutman to improve the company 's management . With the new executives came a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gutman says . " We get a lot of input into major decisions . " A reorganization of management at Nimrod Press Inc. gave the Boston printing firm a setup like few other printing concerns . Nimrod Press has 150 employes ; sales last year were about $11.5 million . In 1972 , when Walter T. Tower Jr . acquired the firm , he was an outstanding printing salesman . With the help of consultants , he has learned to be an executive . " When we were small , " he says , " we had a system of communications that was just holler . People just did their jobs . " Now things are much more formal . There are a treasurer and manufacturing , production and marketing vice presidents . Printing jobs are carefully orchestrated among the production people . THE NEW STRUCTURE ended the practice in which decisions concerning work in progress would go up to a manager for approval , then back down for further processing then up again for another approval . " Work going through our old organization looked like the teeth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done where it should be done without going up and down for approvals . " A sign of organizational problems , consultants say , is a pattern in which routine decisions go to the top people . A good executive will let subordinates make day-to-day decisions and will free himself for weightier problems . Another trouble signal : when volume expands and some part of the operation falters . In manufacturing companies , quality drops and more output ends up in the reject bin . Then schedules are n't met , costs escalate and customers are perturbed because of late deliveries . " That 's a sign that there is n't a good control system . " says Robert Frick , president of Case &; Co. , consultants . Still another indication that managerial assistance is needed can come straight from the mouth of the entrepreneur , says Leon Danco , president of the Center for Family Business . " When you hear talk about controlled growth , or the need to limit the size of the firm , " he says , " you know the guy is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
