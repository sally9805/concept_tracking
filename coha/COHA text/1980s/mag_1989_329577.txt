William Cornelius Van Horne , painter , poker player , collector of Japanese porcelain , was probably the man most responsible for the most beautiful train ride in the western hemisphere . It was 1881 when he took over construction of the trans-Canadian railway , a project that consumed several fortunes , 4 1/2 years of agonizing labor and an untold number of lives . " Since we ca n't export the scenery , " he once said , expressing a frontiersman 's thirsty love of the land , " we 'll have to import the tourists . " <P> For the past century , imported tourists and Canadians alike have treasured his handiwork . The legendary Canadian is one of the last great , long , unforgettable rides left in the world and the only daily transcontinental run in North America . But those who dream of taking the journey will have to start packing . <P> Last week the Canadian government , straining from a subsidy that costs about $85 a passenger , announced that , as of Jan. 15 , 51% of Canada 's national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated . This means the loss of the Canadian and the end of an era . Additional cuts affect thousands of riders across Canada , and their reaction was loud and indignant . " They 've cut the Maritimes and the prairies adrift , " cried Charles Crosby , mayor of the Nova Scotian fishing town of Yarmouth . " The railway was one of the things that held us together . " <P> Losing the Canadian is a sad sacrifice to the bottom line . It is a steel bond linking towns that nobody would otherwise visit with cities that nobody would otherwise leave . During the summer months , 3 out of 4 Canadian passengers are foreigners , seeking perhaps a window on a country . The rest of the travelers are natives , many of whom are seeing the land across the mountains for the first time . <P> The eleven-car train starts in Montreal and hooks up in Sudbury with another train from Toronto before setting out toward the west , along a 2,800-mile route . It plows across the vast prairies of Saskatchewan , where wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is on to the Rockies , along ledges that would make an aerialist faint . It presses near the old Calamity Curve , through the Jaws of Death Gorge and , lest passengers have failed to get the message , into the Devil 's Caldron . <P> Riders love the journey for what they can dream as well as for what they can see : the elk , which roam the Rockies ( " Is that a reindeer ? " ) ; the prairie towns , which resemble those in a grainy old movie ; the vanilla flatlands ; the rolling farms . " More than anything else I can imagine , it makes you appreciate the size and grandeur of the country , " says Geraldine Stevenson , 71 , a retired schoolteacher from Saskatchewan who has ridden the Canadian many times . " It seems we 're always being nibbled at here and there . We 're losing our identity , and trains are a part of that . "                   @ @
