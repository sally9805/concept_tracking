But the African leader takes home only good will <P> " I came , I saw , I was conquered , " Robert Mugabe , Prime Minister of Zimbabwe , declared expansively after a rousing welcome last week in the East Room of the White House . But in his six-day visit to the U.S. , it was Mugabe who did the conquering . Only a year ago , he was a hunted rebel leader , directing his guerrillas against the white-backed government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia . But he swept through the United Nations , New York City and Washington , D.C. , with the aplomb of an experienced diplomat who had spent a lifetime on the international political stage . <P> Mugabe 's first stop in the U.S. was Harlem , where he appealed for solidarity between American and African blacks . His audience replied with cheers , raised fists and chants of " Mu-ga-be . " But officially he had come to the U.S. to address the U.N. , where his nation formally took its place as the 153rd member in the General Assembly . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind that of Britain , its former colonial master . Mugabe , however , had no time for recriminations . He praised Britain for " a job well done " in negotiating the turnover of his country to black majority rule . Though he forecast the eventual development of a home-grown form of socialism in Zimbabwe , he renewed earlier pledges that his country would not be aligned with East or West . Said he : " We will not let any of our friends choose for us who should be our other friends . " <P> Mugabe 's polished , conciliatory tone was in keeping with what he most wanted from his trip : money for his country . He estimated that Zimbabwe would need " something on the order of $1.5 billion in the immediate future " to rebuild its economy , and a total of $4 billion for redevelopment . At a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association in Manhattan 's elegant Plaza Hotel , he said Zimbabwe would welcome investment by any U.S. company that allows some measure of local control , pays decent wages , permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host country . Promised Mugabe : " Investments are safe . Whatever profits accrue , the investors can remit abroad . " <P> In Washington , Mugabe was given a royal reception . While drums and trumpets sounded , an honor guard saluted the Prime Minister on his arrival at the White House . During a private chat with Jimmy Carter , Mugabe once again stressed his country 's urgent need for foreign aid ; he has requested $350 million , but the U.S. so far has sent or promised only $105 million in grants and long-term loans during 1980 and 1981 . U.S. officials maintain lamely-and shortsightedly , given the U.S. interest in Mugabe 's success-that budget problems prevent sending more .
