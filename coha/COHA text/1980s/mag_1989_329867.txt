The death of Lebanon 's body politic , so often declared , may yet prove to have been ( slightly ) exaggerated . Last week , meeting in an abandoned air base at Qlaiaat in northern Lebanon , 58 aging Deputies of the country 's parliament elected Rene Moawad , 64 , a moderate Maronite Christian lawyer who enjoys the backing of Syria , to the presidency . The vote was a crucial step toward fulfilling the conditions of the peace plan brokered last month by the Arab League . <P> Moawad is opposed by General Michel Aoun , commander of the fanatically loyal Christian army in East Beirut . Aoun is enraged that , as part of the peace plan , Moawad is willing to diminish Christian political power and let 40,000 Syrian troops continue to occupy large parts of Lebanon . <P> Aoun is too weak to expel the Syrians himself but strong enough to create havoc . Last week his backers rioted and even roughed up their own religious leader , the pro-Moawad Maronite Patriarch .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
