txt // from other parties . The majority of Labor members in Parliament wished to support the Coalition at least through the period of peacemaking . But in September 1918 the Labor members of the Ministry , with a few exceptions , left the Government . In November a Labor Party Conference with Shaw as the most effective speaker adopted a resolution " that the Party shall resume its independence and withdraw its membership from the Government at the close of the present Parliament . " The vote was 2,117,000 to 810,000 . The party was now " socialist " in language , national in character , and independent in action . Women 's Rights and the Franchise Women 's suffrage and a further liberalization of the voting franchise for men would certainly have come in time . The war hastened them . The Representation of the People Act of February 1918 came out of the report of a nonpartisan Speaker 's Conference on Electoral Reform , appointed in 1916 . This statute abolished all property qualifications for men ? only a residence requirement remained . The vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land or premises with an annual value of ? 5 or whose husbands did so . The age limit was apparently prescribed out of consideration of the possible consequences of the control of parliamentary elections by women voters . This legislation considerably more than doubled the electorate ? a more drastic effect than that of any of the electoral reform measures of the nineteenth century . And just before its dissolution Parliament passed a supplementary bill permitting women to sit in the House of Commons . " The women are splendid " was a standard though banal statement during the war . Women 's suffrage is only the most tangible evidence of their rapidly changing position . The war brought them out of the home . There were changes in occupation , in dress , in hairstyles , in legal status . It was gradually recognized that a place would have to be made in the postwar economy for over 500,000 women with no opportunity for marriage . But it was the contribution of women to the war which brought success in the campaign for " women 's rights . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women into industry and into government jobs was rapid . Once the social barriers to female employment gave way , women broke through at all points . In certain areas ? clerical , commercial , administrative ? employment of women about doubled during the war . On a June day in 1918 a procession of women swept down Constitution Hill to Buckingham Palace to present an address from the women of Britain to the king and queen on the occasion of their silver wedding anniversary . There were the V.A.D. 's ( Voluntary Aid Detachment of Nurses ) ; the Women 's Legion ; the WAAC ( Women 's Army // Auxiliary Corps ) ; the WRENS ( Women 's Royal Naval Service ) ; munitions workers with an anti-gas section in red and a T.N.T . section in yellow ; women police ; omnibus and railway women ; nurses ; ambulance drivers ; General Post Office workers ; gas , light , and coke women .

Stephen McKenna once observed that politics in England were dissocialized when Asquith became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George took his place ( 1916 ) . Mrs. Humphry Ward was more than poetic when she remarked that during the war for many " the door of the future had fallen mysteriously ajar . " In village life there was a minor revolution . It was later recalled that villagers had been heard to say , " How happy this war has made many of us . " They had in mind separation allowances ( often in excess of what the housewife had available before the war ) , greatly improved agricultural wages , and higher prices for produce . The agricultural laborer , in fact , attained a position of respectability which his class had not known for two generations . On the other hand , country house life was disappearing . With rising taxation , particularly in death duties , the economic basis of aristocracy was crumbling . Haldane was understating when at the outbreak of the war he said , " We well-to-do will have in the future to live on half our incomes . " The war produced no such group of aristocratic intellectuals as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country and in the city , in the armed forces , in politics and in business ? strict class lines were blurred . Perhaps for the first time in English history a person 's station in life was not revealed in his dress . Marriages across class lines became common . Well-established standards of good conversation , correct etiquette , and good taste rapidly deteriorated . Social taboos which had governed education , the servant class , and the amusement world also gave way . In " reconstruction " is another important link during the war between the past and the future . " Let us take what comfort we can from these facts ? a new heat of intelligence , a new passion of sympathy and interest which , when the war is over , will burn out of itself the rotten things in our social structure and make reform easy which , but for the war , might have rent us asunder . " Thus Mrs. Ward in 1918 . The promise of " a better world " is a recurring note in war propaganda . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge from it . The word " reconstruction " itself began to be used in 1916 ; it was something of a tonic to flagging spirits . A new Cabinet department ? Labor ? was created in 1916 . H. A. L. Fisher , appointed to the Board of Education by Lloyd // George , delivered his maiden speech in the Commons in April 1917 . He dealt at length ? for more than two hours ? with his subject of educational reform , and was rewarded with unusually heavy applause , in part a testimony of the interest of the House in some subject other than the war . Lloyd George had a special genius for sensing and capitalizing upon moods in public opinion . Upon becoming prime minister at the very moment of crisis in the military fortunes of the war , he was looking ahead , so he enthusiastically reiterated , to a great era of reform . In March 1917 he told a Labor delegation : " The present war . . . presents an opportunity for reconstruction of industrial and economic conditions of this country such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably , the world . " A Ministry of Reconstruction , formalizing a previous committee , was created in 1917 and was soon busily engaged in investigating all phases of British industrial life , as well as housing , public health , and transport . But would such a ministry be able to define postwar problems and develop solutions ? Would material standards of living be raised , as well as moral and intellectual ones ? These questions were asked again and again ? prophetic , perhaps , in the doubts repetition suggested . Yet the Education Act was encouragement to the reforming spirit . Fisher , a well-known historian and vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield , set out to overhaul the educational system . His Act of 1918 enlarged the powers of the L.E.A . ' s ( Local Educational Authorities ) . The general purpose was to establish a national system of education available to all . While the school-leaving age was fourteen , a local authority could extend the school leaving age to fifteen . Further schooling was to be provided for all over fourteen who qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax supported education yet enacted ; unfortunately , many of its provisions were not obligatory and , thus , its implementation was uneven . In other areas , actual " reconstruction " and " reform " were necessarily put off until after the war . The important question raised during the war was the extent to which the State itself would be directly concerned . " Little by little and year by year the fabric of State expenditure and State responsibility is built up like a coral island , cell on cell , " the Economist reported in 1895 . During 1914-18 this process merely picked up speed , with the adoption of military conscription and with controls on industry , trade , food , and natural resources . Although these wartime controls were not long enough in operation to be accepted as social habit , apparently they had worked . Many would urge that they be continued . The average person was made well aware of his changing world . Could Britain capitalize in peacetime on the patriotism , the high sense of national duty , and the grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during four long years of war ? When the armistice came on November 11 , 1918 , no one knew the answer . It was apparently on that day that Osbert Sitwell wrote : ... we were yet illusioned about the peace . During the passage of more than four years , the worse the present had shown itself , the more golden the future , unreal as the conventional heaven , had become to our eyes : an outlook common , perhaps , to those of all ages of war and revolution . And today ... that long present had suddenly become changed to the past , clearly to be seen as such . Hence both the joy and earnestness of dancers in street and square tonight ; hence , too , the difficulty of finding a way in which to describe to the reader the movements that so precisely interpreted conflicting emotions : the long-drawn-out misery and monastic stultification of the trenches , and then the joy of a victory that in the end had rushed on us with the speed and impact of a comet . 6 Aftermath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world-to-be intoxicated us . We were wrought up with ideas inexpres-sible and vaporous , but to be fought for . We lived many lives in those whirling campaigns , never sparing ourselves any good or evil : yet when we achieved and the new world dawned , the old men came out again and took from us our victory , and remade it in the likeness of the former world they knew . Youth could win , but had not learned to keep , and was pitiably weak against age . We stammered that we had worked for a new heaven and a new earth , and they thanked us kindly and made their peace . Lloyd George , said Lord Gladstone , was not as Herbert Fisher called him , a genius thrown up by a cataclysm , but a genie let out of a bottle by a rash mistake of the Conserva-tive Party which was now making desperate efforts to get him back into safe confinement . 1918-1924 At 11 A.M. on that rainy November day , the firing of maroons in London announced the war 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown open the door of No. 10 Downing Street and impulsively shouted advance notice to those gathered in the roadway . Not far away , at the window of his room in the Ministry of Munitions , Winston Churchill saw the streets toward Trafalgar Square , which had been silent and empty , suddenly fill with a mass of hysterical and agitated humanity . Pigeons fluttered around Nelson 's Column . Crowds milled through Charing Cross , Trafalgar Square , and Piccadilly Circus , and then those who could moved in the direction of Buckingham Palace to be greeted by the royal family . Big Ben , silent during the war , boomed again ; and in the evening the street lights , dimmed for more than four years , blazed anew . Out near Garsington in Oxfordshire , Siegfried Sassoon , walking in the river meadows that morning , heard " a sudden peal of bells from the village church and saw little flags being fluttered out from the windows of the thatched houses on the hill . " Herbert Morrison , a conscientious objector and a future Cabinet minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the sirens sounded and the church bells rang . " I stopped digging , " he tells us , " put my foot on my spade and experienced a quiet and profound emotion . " Throughout Britain vast crowds or small groups gathered in city street , in marketplace , in cathedral close , at cottage gate . Each individual had his own thoughts but scarcely anyone was unmoved . For all it was a solemn moment in history . 145 // Of Armistice Day , in striking contrast to Counter-Attack , Sassoon wrote : Everyone suddenly burst out singing ; **29;313;TOOLONG Everyone 's voice was suddenly lifted ; And beauty came like the setting sun : My heart was shaken with tears ; and horror Drifted away . In these lines he captured the passing mood ? a brief return to selfless unity and idealism ; an absence of bitterness , revenge , and national pride . This mood is worthy of some documentation .

The archbishop of Canterbury tells us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reception without parallel in my experience .

" On Monday afternoon , the eleventh , Lloyd George reported to the Commons on the terms of the armistice . He concluded : " This is no time for words . Our hearts are too full of gratitude to which no tongue can give adequate expression . " The House adjourned to St. Margaret 's Church across the street and was there joined by the Lords for a service of prayer .

That evening the prime minister gave serious attention to the proposal that the blockade be lifted and that food ships be quickly dispatched to Germany . On five successive days the king and queen rode through the least favored streets of London . They attended a service of thanksgiving // in St. Paul 's while a vast throng massed outside , the men with heads uncovered .

In response the king said , " May good-will and concord at home strengthen our influence for concord abroad . " The Election of 1918 Now let us shift our attention . It is in the course of the parliamentary election ( the polling was on December 14 ) that we see the mood change . Some months past Lloyd George had pretty well made up his mind to continue the Coalition Government into the postwar period ; back in April he had sounded out the Webbs as to the possibility of cooperation from Labor . This failed ; so did efforts to reconcile Asquith and his wing of the Liberal Party . He was more successful with Bonar Law and the Conservatives , with whom , by October , he had reached agreement on retention of the Coalition and an early appeal to the country in a general election . They both agreed to set aside differences of principle between Liberals and Conservatives on fiscal reform , Irish home rule , and disestablishment of the Church in Wales . Lloyd George 's public statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealistic . His campaign to perpetuate the Coalition was launched in September ; in an address at Manchester he dwelt upon the theme of reform and reconstruction . On November 12 he declared to Coalition Liberals gathered at 10 Downing Street : We must not allow any sense of revenge , and spirit of greed , any grasping desire to override the fundamental principles of righteousness .... Now is the great opportunity of Liberalism ! ... If there are personal differences , in God 's name what do they count in comparison with the vast issues and problems before us ? Let us help to regenerate the people , the great people who have done more to save the world in this great crisis than any other nation . Idealism , Bitterness , Apathy The Coalition campaign opened formally on November 22 with a manifesto proposing an ambitious program of reconstruction : decontrol of industry , land reclamation , a national housing program , reform of the membership of the Lords , home rule for Ireland without Ulster , and responsible government ( by gradual stages ) in India . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electorate , without distinction of Party , to support the Coalition Government in the execution of a policy devised ... for the furtherance of the general good . " On November 12 the prime minister had said , " I would quit this place tomorrow , if I could not obtain the support of Liberals . " Coalition candidates received a letter of support from both Lloyd George and Bonar Law , who agreed that Lloyd George Liberals , to the number of about 150 , were not to be opposed by the Conservatives . But some 229 Liberals were refused the " coupon , " as Asquith dubbed it . Was Lloyd George 's purpose to preserve as many Liberals seats as possible , or was it primarily to defeat those Liberals who had opposed his policies or had voted against him in the Maurice debate ? There has been heated argument over this point ? perhaps Roy Douglas 's conclusion that Lloyd George did not care about either preserving or destroying the Liberal Party as long as he was in control is as reasonable as any . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start ; in more than 500 of the 707 constituencies Coalition Conservatives and Coalition Liberals pooled their resources . Labor was far more hopeful . Labor contested 361 constituencies , in comparison with a previous high of 78 ( January 1910 ) . " Labour 's Call to the People " announced a " comprehensive and constructive " program for the rebuilding of the world .. As between Coalition , independent Liberal , and Labor , issues were quite undefined . But the language of the campaign soon became precise , bitter , and extravagant . The independent Liberal press denounced the " rush election " as " the plan for the extinction of all independent opinion " ( Westminster Gazette , November 13 ) . " The nation is in the presence not of an election but of a conspiracy " ( Daily News , November 23 ) . Just before polling day the Daily Express retorted with the headline " How would the Germans like you to vote ? Think it over . " The campaign of the Coalition began with the accent on reconstruction ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sharp shift of emphasis Lloyd George did not , as sometimes charged , take the lead ; nor was he as immoderate as some of his followers or as extreme as the Northcliffe press . It was not he who made the remark " We shall squeeze the orange until the pips squeak . " Nevertheless , it is interesting to follow his actual words as the campaign progressed . At Wolverhampton on November 24 he said , " Do n't let us waste this victory merely in ringing joy bells . " This must be a land " fit for heroes to live in . " On November 30 he declared to Lord Riddell that the Germans " must pay to the uttermost farthing . But the question is how they can he made to pay beyond a certain point . " Shortly after , before an excited audience in Bristol , he departed from his prepared manuscript and minimized the // difficulties . He suggested that German capacity " will go a pretty long way . " We must have " the uttermost farthing , " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign closed , he summarized his program : ( 1 ) trial of the Kaiser , ( 2 ) punishment of those guilty of atrocities , ( 3 ) fullest indemnity from Germany , ( 4 ) Britain for the British , socially and industrially , ( 5 ) rehabilitation of those broken in the war and ( 6 ) a happier country for all . He was giving the country what it wanted . At a luncheon party " he talked of nothing but the election ? of what cries went down with the electorate , and what did not " ? so Duff Cooper , who was present , wrote in his diary . While most of the press catered to the popular demand for revenge , some elements expressed disgust . Massingham of the Nation , normally Liberal , advised voting Labor . The Times declared ( December 4 ) , " Nobody , we imagine , has any doubts that Mr. Lloyd George would have been wiser if he had frankly gone to the country on his own great record and his own view of social reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates . " The Economist could find no grounds for enthusiasm anywhere . Despite the efforts of the politicians , the campaign did not excite much public interest . Even the party labels were confusing . Punch for December 4 ran a full-page drawing labeled " The Voter 's Nightmare " and in its issue of December 18 commented dryly , " The preliminary announcement that nearly nine hundred candidates must fail to be elected . . . has been received with a good deal of quiet satisfaction . " Delay in arranging for the armed forces vote disfranchised most of it . Slightly more than 50 percent of the electorate voted ? a small proportion for a twentieth-century election . But the voting public had been completely transformed ? something like 75 percent of those who had the franchise in 1918 had not previously qualified . The result was a victory beyond all expectation for Lloyd George and the Coalition : success in some 520 contests ? of which 136 were won by couponed Liberals ? out of a total of 707 . Within the Coalition , Conservatives controlled more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crushed and emerged with only 33 seats . Asquith himself failed of reelection in the constituency which had returned him for thirty-two years . The 59 seats won by Labor made them the strongest party in opposition in the new Parliament ? labor had polled 22 percent of the popular vote , a leap forward and indicative of things to come . However , their militants ( Henderson , MacDonald , Snowden ) were all defeated by " coupon " candidates ; conservative trade unionists predominated among the winners ; leadership in Parliament fell to William Adamson , limited in outlook and in ability . In Irish constituencies the old National Irish Party ( the party of home rule ) returned only 7 ; Sinn Fein // ( the party of revolution ) almost swept the board with 73 seats , but these seats were not taken . Peacetime Coalition and the New Commons The policy of Lloyd George in this election constitutes one of the most controversial episodes in his career . Was he justified in going to the country at just this time ? Should he not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate precedent of the khaki election of 1900 ? Did Lloyd George deliberately exploit the circumstances of 1918 ? The answers depend on where one turns . But it is well to keep in mind certain facts . An election immediately after the war seems to have been almost inevitable . The Parliament elected in 1910 was , by 1918 , no longer in any sense representative . Since then the electorate had been expanded , Labor had grown restless and more powerful , national problems had radically changed . No Cabinet could have hoped to succeed after the war without assurance of popular support . While the sheer necessity for an election can hardly be proved , the arguments for an early poll , quite apart from matters of partisanship , were very strong . Furthermore , there was nothing sinister in Lloyd George 's decision to perpetuate the war Coalition . Churchill made a similar proposal after World War II . In 1918 the alternative for Lloyd George was reconciliation with Asquith , and that would have been difficult indeed . Lloyd George , of course , catered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be in the making . In 1918 the consequences of a continuation of the Coalition under Lloyd George could not be foreseen . The extent to which that Government was responsible for the terms of peace and for the crisis at home and abroad in postwar years can not be established , though Asquith Liberals asserted the contrary . It is highly questionable whether an exclusively Tory Government the only conceivable alternative to the Coalition ? would have been any more successful . In the United States , President Wilson fought the congressional elections of November 1918 on a strictly partisan basis , and this brought upon him much the same kind of criticism as was heaped upon Lloyd George for not reverting to strictly partisan politics . These points seem valid and relevant . Yet it was soon apparent that the election of 1918 was itself quite unfortunate . The operation of the constitutional process in England depends on party , and normally England " does not love coalitions , " for they render effective criticism of governmental policy difficult . The very chamber of the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of // four distinct political alignments ( Conservative , Coalition Liberal , Independent Liberal , and Laborite ) confounded an essential feature of cabinet government , that of the establishment of party responsibility for policy . While the Coalition , Conservative-dominated , enjoyed a crushing superiority in the Commons , the popular vote for its candidates was only slightly in excess of the popular vote of the defeated parties . In point of fact , it was not a representative House , some would say the least representative since 1832 . Nearly all the effective leaders of Opposition parties had been defeated . And it was unfortunate for a land which needed unity that those who were elected were predominantly wealthy and predominantly commercially minded . Austen Chamberlain tells a story quoting Lloyd George as referring jocosely to the " Associated Chambers of Commerce " behind him . In bitterness the defeated exploited the celebrated remark by Baldwin to Keynes that the new House was " a group of hard-faced men who looked as if they had done well out of the war . " The remark was perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Nicolson called it " the most unintelligent body of public-school boys which ... the Mother of Parliaments has known . " And a reputable historian ( F. S. Northedge ) refers to the 1918 Parliament as " certainly one of the most insular and ignorant in British history . " The election campaign left the country 's leadership divided , not on principles but by personal grievances . Opposition forces felt that they had been victimized , and they were not inclined to be moderate or fairminded toward those who had taken advantage of them . There was now much less chance that the peace conference could be approached in a reasonable manner and that a policy of domestic reform and reconstruction could be formulated on a basis of mutual good will and in the national interest . The unhappy consequences were soon apparent . The National Temper But this general election must not be judged out of context . It is merely an important episode in the war 's aftermath . Any Parliament , no matter its composition , would have been on the defensive , for the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little heeded . Any Cabinet and any Parliament after 1918 would have had difficulty in establishing sound policy acceptable to the nation in the face of baffling postwar problems and new party alignments . The politicians , Lloyd George included , conducted themselves at least as intelligently and at least as responsibly as the nation at large . The mood of Parliament reflects the general mood of the nation , which probably received the quality of leadership it deserved . // Divisions , Anxieties , and Frustrations In this section we are concerned with the entire decade of the twenties . The morale of Britain in these years is something which could not have been predicted . Hers was more the psychology of a land which had lost confidence in its rulers than one now in gratitude dedicating its energies to the uses of peace . The national outlook reflected more the divisions of a land torn by defeat than a unity born of sacrifice to a great ideal . It was the mentality of a land affected with a malaise . Some of the elements may be easily distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million men were returned to civilian life . Immediately evident was the antagonism between " the Fighting Forces " and " the Rest , " as phrased by the authors of a very stimulating treatment of the 1920s , The Long Week-End . The veteran was very conscious of the gap between industrial wages during the war and his own meager service pay . He was not disposed to take very seriously the stories of suffering at home . A million veterans came home to find their old jobs in the hands of men who had never gone off to war or in the hands of women . Furthermore , combat troops had come to know " the enemy " as fellow soldiers in the trenches ? human beings like themselves caught in a terrible predicament ? and not as " the Huns " of the popular press . These veterans shared little in the popular cry for retribution and revenge . Richard Aldington describes these veterans further : " turbulent , impatient , full of strange oaths , contemptuous of anything that looked like humbug ... always getting together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one topic ? the war , which they refused to discuss with anyone who had not been in it . " " On the other hand , " he continues , " was the civilian population , frayed in its nerves , crushed with taxation , anxious about its own future , with all its benevolence and emotional sympathy long since exhausted . ... Not until the flood of war books ten years later did they realize what the young men had endured . " It was partly a conflict of generations . To those returning from the trenches , the war had been the most important experience they had ever known . They came back restless and expectant , and with no desire to have restored the world of 1914 which had produced the war . They were ready " for a new heaven and a new earth . " But they were quickly and perhaps too easily disillusioned . They found that their elders did not wish to make a place for them , in fact , pretty much ignored them . The " lost generation " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. E. Lawrence ( as in the bitter words quoted at the begin153 The National Temper ping of this chapter ) or in Vera Brittain 's Testament of Youth ( 1933 ) ? especially the chapter " Survivors not wanted " ? becomes normal and more convincing elsewhere . C. E. Montague 's Disenchantment ( 1922 ) is " an essay on disillusion . " And E. L. Woodward in his charming and poignant autobiography , Short Journey , remarks : Most of the scholars who wrote our books had been prevented by age or health from going to war . It struck me that very few of them , or the civil servants who had been in London for the four evil years , had any idea of the immense moral destruction , the lowering of standards , the confusion and disorder of mind which modern war must produce over the area where the fighting has taken place , and among ordinary men within the battle zones .

I thought also that the survivors of this generation would be able to use in peace their experiences learned in war . I thought that the future was in our hands ; that we should get the support of those immediately younger than ourselves ; that our elders would listen to us , and , for very shame , be ready to give us a directing control over the management of affairs . These hopes have been disappointed . But hardly all of the lost generation were as eager to reconstruct the world as T. E. Lawrence , Vera Brittain , or E. L. Woodward suggest .

" " Mass Civilization " Not until a decade after 1918 did the war become the subject of popular literature . Most people were " fed up " with the war ; this phrase was developed for the occasion . The reading public had greatly increased during the war , but the literature of the masses was the literature of escape , particularly " the thriller " and " the shocker . " Edgar Wallace ( 1875 ? 1932 ) wrote and published at least 170 volumes ? many of his novels were delivered to a dictaphone. // For the masses the lowest standards set the tone . It was the era " of the exploitation of the cheap response " ( F. R. Leavis ) .

Sigmund Freud ( 1856 ? 1939 ) replaced old mysteries with new : the world of man 's subconscious and unconscious behavior . The brilliant Dean Inge ( 1860 ? 1954 ) of St. Paul 's Cathedral , of whom it was said that he was sorry he was a Christian , became " the gloomy dean " ; in 1922 he referred to the nineteenth century as " the most wonderful century in human history " and saw little hope for the future . The Webbs lost their buoyancy ; in 1928 Beatrice was writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catastrophic subsidence in physical comfort and mental development ? " After the war the most active minds in literary circles were ready for a sharp break with the past . To reflect life as it is , to get at the real meaning of human experience and to clothe it in adequate language , now required wholly new techniques of analysis and new forms of expression . The best of the old writers ? Moore , Hardy , Bennett , Galsworthy , Wells , even Shaw ? seemed not only outmoded but even second-rate . In employing society as a framework for analyzing the individual they were missing the point . Plot , setting , and narrative are mere contrivances of the writer to satisfy his reader . Reality , so the new approach held , is found in the individual , and the world about him is significant only insofar as he is aware of it . His response is complex and must be explored at various levels of consciousness . Therefore , the first duty of the writer , in a phrase , is to get " inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued writing and continued to be // read . John Masefield , poet laureate in 1930 , published his narrative poem Reynard the Fox in 1919 . Shaw seemed to be at the height of his powers with St. Joan in 1923 . Galsworthy was just completing The Forsyte Saga in the early twenties , and Bennett continued writing almost until his death in 1931 . But the powerful voices were now elsewhere . What is often considered the avant-garde was the " Bloomsbury Group " ( already mentioned ) , a London circle focusing on Leonard and Virginia Woolf and the Hogarth Press , which was primarily interested in ideas ? creative , unconventional , experimental ideas . Its members were intensely serious , very selfconscious ( though the " Bloomsbury " label was more used of them than by them ) and , though hardly consistent with their emphasis on the experimental , quite dogmatic . From one of them in 1918 came a work which made literary history . World War I ended not with a masterpiece in the form of a song of praise or hymn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjective , one must emphasize , was satirical . In this repudiation of the Victorian achievement we have a significant introduction to postwar literary production . Freud 's influence , particularly his explication of the conflict between the conscious and the unconscious , found special expression in the works of E. M. Forster and Virginia Woolf . The latter considered the conventional novel with comedy and tragedy , triumph and catastrophe , a false representation of life . In her essay on " Modern Fiction , " originally written in 1919 , she said : " Life is not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged ; but a luminous halo , a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end . Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying , this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit , whatever aberration or complexity it may display , with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible ? " ? It was a question that her own writing attempted to answer . The " stream of consciousness " style was brought to perfection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 but banned in England until the thirties . Joyce presents through " internal monologue " all the sensations and experiences of three individuals in the course of one day . At a casual glance the work seems but a chaos of disconnected thought and feeling . Some reviewers found it " unreadable , " some " un quotable , " and others " unreviewable . " Yet Joyce was so much of : t virtuoso that Leopold Bloom emerges as one of the most distinct characters in modern literature . Poetry was given a new direction by T. S. Eliot , whose The Waste f . , nod ( 1922 ) came to symbolize for many the problem of life . Man and his environment no longer harmonize ; the modern " waste land " is society uprooted and adrift . The poem employs Eliot 's famous ironic contrast , // the fusing of " memory and desire " ; the symbolism is learned and sometimes obscure . Some critics found him unintelligible ; others found him pretentious and arrogant . The Human Problem But within a decade that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama Murder in the Cathedral ( 1935 ) was widely produced . The work of Aldous Huxley was acclaimed . Students in provincial British universities and in midwestern American colleges came soon to be absorbed with Eliot , Virginia Woolf , and eventually Joyce as well . These writers were widely imitated , though usually with indifferent success . Their techniques came into popular and uncritical usage . And so the high-brow , the middle-brow , and even the low-brow proved to have much in common . If the Edwardians had been disenchanted with the past , the postwar generation was disenchanted with the present . Life must be " debunked . " The complexities of urban civilization , the impact of new knowledge , the disillusion with the idealism of the war , all underlined the human problem . That intellectuals could not agree on the answer is another characteristic of the age . If there could only be " clarification of fundamental ideas , " as Sir Herbert Samuel put it later in his Memoirs . Some felt that bare recognition of the problem was its solution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst and fear , " said W. H. Auden in tribute to Eliot on his sixtieth birthday . For others the only reality was subjective , the way out in personal vanity and social anarchy . The answer to the claims of society was disengagement ; the problem could be profitably examined only in a spirit of irony and fantasy . But many looked for salvation through politics and social reform . Members of the Bloomsbury Group were generally " leftist . " Sassoon became literary editor of the Daily Herald , and Ezra Pound a Fascist . Some , particularly in the thirties , turned to communism . H. G. Wells pinned his hopes on a " World State " ; in 1920 he wrote The Outline of History to demonstrate the artificiality of nationalism and the vitality of the common experience of mankind . There were signs of a widespread religious revival . In the twenties a strong " modernist " movement swept through the Church of England ; conferences considered the theme " the humanist Christ , " and a commission analyzed divergent opinions of Christian belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the social order as well . In Birmingham in 1924 , a Conference on Politics , Economics , and Citizenship ( COPEC ) , interdenominational in character , chaired by William Temple , then the bishop of Manchester , undertook , in the words of the secretary , to establish " a norm of Christian thought and action for // the further working out of a Christian order . " " Capitalism , " " Imperialism , " " Industrialism " all came under attack . The ideas tested at this conference more than lingered on . In a broader context , many an individual went his own way seeking peace of mind . Julian Huxley in Religion without Revelation ( 1927 ) revived the conflict between science and religion and sought to secure the best of both worlds . C. S. Lewis , an Oxford scholar , found salvation in orthodox Anglicanism , T. S. Eliot became an Anglo-Catholic , and the novelist Evelyn Waugh was converted to Rome . At all levels of literacy and sophistication new bearings were being sought . That English thought came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their depth and validity . That Britain produced creative and experimental minds and then sifted and absorbed their contributions is indicative of her own vitality . Abortive Reconstruction Economic developments and politics lend themselves more readily to chronological treatment . Our first pause in their examination will be at the end of 1924 . In the interim after 1918 Britain soon found herself , with some surprise , in economic straits which were to remain a fairly normal feature of her national life . A program of reconstruction had been envisaged ? decontrol in industry and its modernization , a housing program , educational and social reform . But events proved otherwise , and an increase in economic distress widened the cleavage between left and right . Four administrations and three general elections provide a shifting pattern in which the most dramatic development was the replacement of the Liberals by the Laborites as a major party and the formation of the first Labor Government in 1924 . Boom and Depression For most people the immediate problems were economic . And yet , save in very general terms ( such as problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve times that of 1913 , the process of the changeover from war production to peacetime enterprise ) , no one anticipated just what the demands of the postwar situation would be . It would have been more healthy for the economy , if grave difficulties were to appear , had they appeared promptly . Yet , as it happened , for eighteen months ( until the spring of 1920 ) there was a postwar boom no less real , if artificial . In industry a demand for goods to replace depleted stocks and considerable need for capital to restore peacetime production provided stimulus . The Agricultural Act of 1920 encouraged production of // wheat and oats with minimum prices guaranteed . Tenant farmers felt greater security and began to buy the land which they cultivated . Generally speaking , wages and prices rose along with full employment . But the farmer , the policy makers in Westminster , and men of business and industry were thrown off guard . In the course of 1920 , conditions radically changed . Agricultural prices collapsed and the Corn Production Repeal Act of 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy generally , when supply caught up with demand , when foreign countries took steps to stimulate their own production , when financial interests took fright and curbed credit , when European markets were once more open to American and Asiatic production ? all this reacted unfavorably against Britain . Let us first take a general view . Economic analyses generally consider the period 1919 ? 29 as a whole ; but since in Britain the situation was stabilized from 1925 to the world depression of 1929 , these findings will be relevant to our immediate period . For more than a century , Britain 's economy had been geared to production for a world market , with heavy imports in food and raw materials . It was , indeed , in her view , " one economic world " controlled by herself . She seemed to have taken in stride the competitive challenge from the United States , Germany , and Japan in the prewar years . But the Great War had intensified economic nationalism ? and each nation was learning to live on her own , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Britain . In consequence , by 1924 , Britain was maintaining her export position only in those commodities which were expanding the least . Britain 's share of the world 's exports , of whatever nature , fell from 13 percent in 1913 to 11 percent in 1929 . And the proportion of her total production directed into foreign trade declined over these years . Total production did not reach prewar levels until 1924 . It is not easy to make an accurate and intelligent assessment of Britain 's economy in the twenties . The ablest of the economic historians disagree on some of the fundamentals . Derek H. Aldcroft and Harry W. Richardson , in recent studies , while recognizing the general decline in Britain 's relative position since the nineteenth century insist that the postwar period was not one of stagnation and that her record stands up well against that of other countries . In particular , they stress the structural changes in Britain 's economy ? the modernization of technology and the development of new industries ? rayon , electrical engineering , chemicals , and especially motorcars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular W. Arthur Lewis and A. J. Youngson , point out the limitations of the British achievement , the delays of industrial and political leadership in meeting changing conditions , and the ultimate failure of Britain to keep pace with her rivals . While recognizing that both these positions // have merit and are hardly contradictory , we shall tend to emphasize the weaknesses in Britain 's economy , which , in the long run , are the factors of most significance , factors social as well as economic , in our examination of Britain in transition . The postwar boom ceased in the spring of 1920 ; a year later , hosts of the unemployed were parading with banners : " Wanted in 1914 ; not wanted now . " In 1920 insurance applied to nearly all the unemployed , and thus the widely publicized figures were accurate and well known . By July 1921 unemployment reached 2,000,000 constituting 22.4 percent of all insured workers ; in the shipbuilding and in the iron and steel trades the figure was 27 percent . The proper figure for comparison for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . To be sure , the July 1921 situation was abnormal because of the coal strike , but even at the end of 1923 ( a year after the coal settlement ) the figure was 13 percent . At no time during the period from 1922 to 1929 did the unemployment figure fall much below 10 percent of the insured workers , with the average about 12 percent . Opportunities Missed The twin problems were lagging production and rising unemployment . To have solved the first would have ameliorated the second . It was certainly not easy to determine precisely what steps to take , but business and government did not make sufficient attempt . Leadership was proud that Britain seemed to have weathered the war years better than any other nation and was still second only to the United States in economic strength . Business interests usually proposed nineteenth-century solutions for such problems as there were . Economic laws were fixed ; the " system " would in time right itself . Away with DORA and all it stood for . World Trade would be recaptured by free trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , the country must , of course , return to prewar parity of exchange . If this meant a price rise above that of her competitors , costs of production would have to be reduced . In contrast , as we now see the situation , it would seem that Britain might well have profited by such steps as these : ( 1 ) restriction of imports and stimulation of home industry for home consumption ; ( 2 ) the development of greater strength in producer goods ( such as machinery , chemicals , implements , and automobiles ) for export ; ( 3 ) more prompt modernization of the coal , steel , and textile industries ; ( 4 ) a more flexible foreign exchange , less commitment to the prewar gold standard ; thus , a stimulus to export trades and a corresponding decline in imports , and , hopefully , rising levels of employment . // But , of course , much of this comment is hindsight ; the results of the policies Britain did pursue can not be fully seen until 1929 . Until then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pay her bills abroad and even have a little surplus to invest abroad . A slightly favorable balance of trade was maintained , but at the expense of a high rate of unemployment and a very low standard of living for many . The general strike of 1926 could not be foreseen nor the financial crisis of 1931 nor the staggering unemployment figures for the early thirties . But with a more flexible and more imaginative policy in the twenties Britain might well have weathered these difficulties more promptly and with less distress . Versailles and Foreign Policy Similarly , in international relations , Britain was unable to return to " normalcy , " to prewar stability based on balance of power , to a climate favorable to world trade upon which her economic well-being so much depended . The initial problem was in part psychological ; she could not decide just where her national interests lay in a changing world ; idealism and self-interest conflicted . Only gradually did the outline of her postwar policy emerge : diplomacy by negotiation to reduce tension , disarmament to a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in national boundaries on the continent , a general rehabilitation of Germany and a strengthening of imperial and commonwealth ties . But there was little orderly thinking along these lines in 1919 . At first the loudest voices ( including the Coalition parties in 1918 ) demanded a severe peace imposed upon Germany and her allies , and as Shaw remarked ( in the preface to Heartbreak House ) , the Government " did not find it as easy to escape from this pledge as it had from nobler ones . " But more often than not Lloyd George 's own role as one of the " Big Three " at the Paris Conference ( January-June 1919 ) was that of mediator between the realism of Premier Clemenceau of France and the idealism of President Wilson of the United States . During a crisis in negotiations in March 1919 , Lloyd George went off to Fontainbleau for the weekend and returned with " Some Considerations for the Peace Conference Before They Finally Draft Their Terms . " In this memorandum Lloyd George urged reasonable terms of peace which would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reparations should not be so heavy as to drive Germany into the hands of the Bolsheviks . He promptly received a telegram from his supporters in the Commons demanding that he keep to his election pledge " to present the bill in full , to make Germany acknowledge the debt , and then to discuss ways and // means of obtaining payment . " Lloyd George returned to London and in a brilliant reply in the Commons ( April 16 ) maneuvered out of the difficulty . It was an " oratorical Austerlitz , " said Garvin in the Observer . Britain had a very considerable part in the drafting of the Covenant of the League of Nations , the first major action of the Conference . A postwar international organization had been accepted in principle by the Allies during the war ; in Britain it was usually conceived of as an extension of the idea of the concert of Europe ? little change in Britain 's own position , political or military , was envisaged . The very term , " League of Nations " was coined by an Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A draft statement by Lord Robert Cecil of the British Foreign Office , along with Wilson 's proposals , provided the basis for the Covenant . And the League promptly provided a settlement of the thorny problem of German colonies , all surrendered at the end of the war . They became " mandates , " exercised under authority of the League ; Britain was given the mandate over German East Africa ( Tanganyika ) ; the Union of South Africa received the mandate over South West Africa ; Australia over New Guinea ; and New Zealand over Samoa . Thus , much the greater part of the German colonial empire came under British and Commonwealth control . As for the Turkish empire , the Treaty of Sevres in 1920 gave Palestine , Mesopotamia , and Trans-Jordan as mandates to Britain . In Britain public opinion played a very important role in the aftermath of the peace conference , and mistakes were made not so much at Versailles as at home . The treaty ( signed at Versailles on June 28 ) was , to be sure , promptly ratified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them Irish outraged that the principle of selfdetermination at the peace conference had not been applied to Ireland ) . But this vote was misleading , and very soon large sections of public opinion moved against the treaty ? partisanship led to inconsistency , and the treaty was debated in the spirit of the election of 1918 . The Liberals , the Laborites , and the Union of Democratic Control were now as intemperate as Lloyd George had been during the election campaign . The weaknesses in the treaty and the excesses were blamed on Lloyd George , who had generally stood for moderation in the treaty-making process . Narrow politics and ill nature go far to explain the enthusiasm for John Maynard Keynes 's The Economic Consequences of the Peace ( 1919 ) , easily the most influential of the attacks on the Versailles Treaty . Had the resilience of a nation at war held over into the peace , it is not likely that Keynes would have written these lines : " In this autumn of 1919 , in which I write , we are at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion , the fears , and the sufferings of the past five years is at its height . . . . We have been moved already beyond endurance and need // rest . Never in the lifetime of men now living has the universal element in the soul of men burnt so dimly . " But indifference can be more dangerous than pessimism . As circles of opinion widened from Westminster they were increasingly sterile ? without vitality , witout purpose , without maturity . The nation which had readily believed that it was a war to end wars and a war to secure peace with justice was not prepared to use British power to promote those objectives . Once the German threat seemed eliminated , peace was regarded as merely a habit of mind and not an object of foreign policy . France 's problems were not understood . As one writer put it , " The North Sea is wider than the Rhine . " Britain 's spirit had brought victory but did not extend to a realistic appraisal of Britain 's good fortune in the past in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations and needs of other peoples . Clash of Interests and Ideologies Before we trace the course of politics after 1918 we must take cognizance of a subtle change in British political parties . This is well introduced by a remark of Arthur Balfour early in the century : " Our alternating Cabinets , though belonging to different parties , have never differed about the fundamentals of society .... It is evident that our whole political machinery presupposes a people so fundamentally at one that they can safely afford to bicker ; and so sure of their own moderation that they are not dangerously disturbed by the never ending din of political conflict . " Down to 1906 the natural distribution of mankind as either Liberal or Conservative , immortalized by Gilbert and Sullivan in lolanthe , did not constitute a serious cleavage of the British people . And so the bitterness which characterized politics seems astonishing . For with few exceptions the leadership of the two major parties still shared the same social background . They dressed alike , were educated alike , even looked alike . Winston Churchill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close personal friends . Geoffrey Robinson ( later Dawson ) , who became editor of The Times in 1912 , was a Unionist by conviction , but his friendships included most of the leading Liberals . These examples could be multiplied . The Edwardian years , we may say , marked the end of this rather accidental distribution of voters between traditional parties and the essential harmony of society and politics . After 1918 the Liberals were so sharply divided between those in the Coalition and those in the Opposition that any reassembling seemed next to impossible . It was a conflict of loyalties rather than a conflict of ideas . The Liberal Party was ceasing to // have any cohesion in leadership or in constituency . The Nonconformist vote , long identified with Liberalism , ceased to have any identity politically and was distributed among all parties . Furthermore , any notion that the Liberals were the party of the middle class was losing force . The very term " middle class " was losing its magic , as C. F. G. Masterman tells us in his brilliant England After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , whose numbers in the electorate expanded in 1918 , prepared to follow the Liberal lead . As for the Conservatives , they were for the moment comfortably situated , but dared not examine too closely the ties which bound them to Lloyd George . And as a matter of practical politics of the future , they had to capture some of the growing working-class vote . To replace the traditional division between " Liberalism " and " Conservatism , " an entirely new alignment seemed in the making ? one based on economic class interests , on ideological attitudes toward social change , on conflicting views of the role of the State , on Britain 's role in the world . After the war , the stimulus of fear ? fear of the other side ? accelerated the trend . The Right The right drew its strength from business , from the well-established professional classes , from members of the Church of England , and from what remained of the landed aristocracy . It adhered , in general , to the dominant philosophy and attitudes of the late nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; governmental regulation of society kept to a minimum ; distrust of the masses and , therefore , distrust of labor ; confidence in the essential rightness of the British Empire ; and reliance upon the sterling qualities of the " British character . " More particularly : in fiscal policy they were committed to the maintenance of the gold standard but were tending in the direction of protection ; in foreign policy they favored retreat to a position of semi-isolation , with cautious support of the League of Nations and the stabilizing of Europe ( particularly of Germany ) in the interests of British trade ; they were fearful of Soviet Russia , to whom they were unreservedly opposed ; they believed that imperial ties should be retained and strengthened . This is a general statement ; there were , of course , exceptions , and differences in detail . But the strongest bond within the right was opposition to " socialism . " This concern led them at times to regard the views of the extremists within the labor movement as representative of it generally and to be fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number referred in 1923 to the " division between constitutionalism and socialism . " // The very existence of a Coalition Government inspired conjecture about possible political combinations . There was effort at formal merger of Liberal and Conservative , to strengthen the right . Churchill , by nature a centrist with no distinctive political philosophy , sought to capitalize on this mood . In July 1919 he declared that " the democratic forces in Conservatism and the patriotic forces in Liberalism can not longer be kept apart , " and he called for " a Central Combination , ending the old Party system and all its evils . " In March 1920 Lloyd George discussed with Coalition Liberals the possibility of forming a National Democratic Party ; a year later the label " Fusion " was suggested . Early in 1922 a Cecil-Asquith-Grey alliance seemed to have a new Liberal-Conservative Party in the making . The Left On the other hand , the possibility of a broadly based union of the left was briefly in the minds of Laborites and Opposition Liberals . Dissident Liberals , most of them Fabians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Labor . Included were Leo Chiozza Money ( of Riches and Poverty fame ) , who was a Liberal M.P . until 1918 ; C. P. Trevelyan and Noel Buxton , who finished out their long parliamentary careers as Laborites ; Lord Haldane , the war secretary and lord chancellor of the Asquith Government ; H. W. Massingham , editor of the Nation , who reluctantly abandoned his notions of bringing together Radical Liberalism and Labor , and was in a real sense converted to Labor ; Arthur Ponsonby ( whose father had been private secretary to Queen Victoria ) , a Liberal M.P . from 1910 to 1918 who returned to the House in 1922 as a Laborite ; William Temple , a rising churchman who was to become archbishop of Canterbury . Those associated with the Left were not united by ideology but did manage to achieve considerable agreement on an immediate program : nationalization of key industries , particularly those in which wage scales were unsatisfactory ; opposition to the gold standard ; a program for housing and other social services ; genera ( support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with repudiation of the principle of the balance of power ; a hostile attitude toward imperialism with special sympathy for Indian nationalism . Immediately after the war , the Labor movement included some strong voices for " direct action " in industry and " socialism " in government . Two quite different publications of 1920 will illustrate . An American writer , Arthur Gleason , accurately presented the mood of a section of the British working class ; " Britain is faced by universal unrest in the working class and by a demand that economic power shall be shifted from the owners of // capital to the workers " is the opening sentence of his What the Workers Want : A Study of British Labour . From a quite different background there was R. H. Tawney 's The Sickness of an Acquisitive Society , published by the Fabian Society . An economic historian at the London School of Economics , Tawney suggested that the nation " had stumbled upon one of the turning points of history . " Society must be reorganized " on the basis of function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by " performance of service . " Economic activity must assume its proper place " as the servant , not the master , of society . " Thus , there was evidence of the widening of the breach between the right and the left , perhaps extending to ideology . A dramatic moment came on March 20 , 1923 , in the socialist motion in Parliament by Snowden that " this House declares that legislative effort should be directed to the gradual supercession of the capitalist system by an industrial and social order based on public ownership and democratic control of the instruments of production and distribution . " This resolution , he added , was intended " as a direct challenge to the holders and defenders of the capitalist system . " The debate was widely publicized . With the Conservatives overwhelmingly in control , the resolution was , of course , defeated ( 368 ? 121 ) . In April 1923 , a dispute in the Commons led to a disorderly scene and the lusty singing of " The Red Flag " by Labor back-benchers . In June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two years later the Cambridge Union debated a motion that the " practical application " of the principles of socialism " will promote the happiness of the English people . " Certain members of the Independent Labor Party were intrigued with the possibilities of international cooperation among socialists . In February 1919 MacDonald , Henderson , J. H. Thomas , and other British Laborites forgathered with continental socialists at a world socialist conference at Berne . But actual flirting with international communism was limited to a few . The Communist Party of Great Britain , formed in 1920 , was never more than a few thousand in number ; its persistent efforts for affiliation with the Labor Party were overwhelmingly rejected year after year by the National Executive and by the annual party conference . MacDonald himself , after brief hesitation , led the fight against association of British Labor with the Third International . Short of allegiance with an alien movement , there was , however , serious agitation for militancy within the Labor Party itself . In the years 1919 ? 21 , party conferences several times endorsed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as F. W. Jowett of Bradford , George Lansbury of Poplar , or John Wheatley of Clydeside would ever get control of the party was for a time uncertain . But as the historian Maurice Cowling ( The Impact of Labour 1920 ? // 24 , 1970 ) has observed , at this time the labor movement was " a ragbag of attitudes , purposes , programs and intentions . " That which provided unity of a sort was trade union leadership and trade union interests ; they were not socialist in any militant sense . As a class , the workers and their families , were not moved by socialist propaganda  --   --  Cowling observes that they had a much greater passion for sports . The leaders were politically rather than socially minded , and that leadership gained power and prestige when the weak parliamentary committee was replaced in 1920 by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress . J. R. Clynes , long respected in the trade union world and created a privy councillor in recognition of services rendered during the war , became leader of the Parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Labor 's expanding role , quite independent of Liberalism . Party strength in the Commons rose to 142 in the general election of 1922 . James Ramsay MacDonald , chairman of the Independent Labor Party since 1921 and now ( 1922 ) back in Parliament , was elected to party leadership . His narrow victory ( a margin of five over Clynes ) was due to support from the I.L.P. , particularly from the militant " Clyde Brigade " of eleven from Glasgow and vicinity , who then regarded MacDonald as sharing their ardently socialistic doctrines . It proved to be the most important vote in the Parliamentary Labor Party in the century , for it was this vote which placed MacDonald in line for the premiership , though perhaps few of his supporters had this in mind then . Postwar Politics under Lloyd George The Coalition Government , established in 1916 and confirmed in the election of 1918 , came to an end on October 19 , 1922 , when the Conservatives in Parliament voted their party 's independence . It now seems remarkable that the Lloyd George Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wide were the differences of policy within the Cabinet itself . On November 8 , 1922 , shortly after Lloyd George 's resignation , the Westminster Gazette printed the following : " Lloyd George in 1918 : What is our task ? To make Britain a country fit for heroes to live in .... ' Lloyd George in 1922 : I am not against the working man , but I implore him not go down the wrong avenue seeking a paradise that is not there . " ' Now the Westminster Gazette was a Liberal organ hostile to the Coalition . Nonetheless , these quotations are an accurate reflection of the gap between Lloyd George 's easy promises of " a new society " and the actual accomplishments of his Government . The essence of " the condition of England question " in the postwar years was how to improve the living standard of the workingman and how to establish harmonious relations // between employer and employee . The weakness of Lloyd George 's record was not so much failure of achievement as the equivocal character of all his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the months immediately following the armistice , local strikes of engineers and shipyard workers on the Clyde and in Belfast aroused concern , and the Government summoned a National Industrial Conference of employers and trade union representatives in Central Hall , Westminster , late in February 1919 . The delegates convened in high expectation that a new charter of labor relations would be drafted that would include machinery for arbitrating industrial problems . The conference unanimously passed recommendations for a minimum wage , for a maximum normal forty-eight-hour week , for policies which would stabilize employment , and for the creation of a permanent National Industrial Council to advise the Government . Sir Robert Horne , minister of labor and chairman of the conference , read a message from the prime minister promising immediate and sympathetic attention to any proposals made . But once the conference adjourned , its recommendations were apparently ignored . Quite naturally , therefore , Lloyd George 's move in calling the conference was widely interpreted as nothing more than tactical . Of the early strikes , that of the coal miners was most serious . Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : increased wages , a six-hour working shift , and nationalization of the industry . A strike was planned which , it was hoped , would have the support of its allies ( railway and transport workers ) in the reestablished Triple Alliance . Lloyd George persuaded the Miners ' Federation to put off the strike and to participate in a royal commission to investigate the problems of the industry , including the question of nationalization . This commission , under the chairmanship of Justice Sankey , was equally divided between those acceptable to the miners and those acceptable to management . An interim report ( March 20 ) , recommending some though not all of the miners ' demands on wages and hours , was accepted by the miners . In its final report ( June 23 ) the commission unanimously supported nationalization of coal royalities . A bare majority ( Sankey siding with the miners ' representatives ) recommended " either nationalization or a measure of unification by national purchase . " Sankey , however , differed with the miners on the nature and method of national control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used a strike which broke out in Yorkshire as justification for rejecting nationalization altogether . Even the recommendation for nationaliza169 Postwar Politics under Lloyd George tion of royalities got nowhere . The only tangible results of the Sankey Commission were the Coal Mines Act of 1919 , establishing a seven-hour day ? seven hours at the coal face ? and temporary legislation in 1920 limiting profits and continuing governmental subsidy and control . The baiting of the owners ' representatives by the miners ' representatives during the deliberations of the Sankey Commission was not forgotten or forgiven and seems to have contributed to the uncompromising attitude of the operators in the following years . The Sankey Commission proved to be but the first of five such on the coal industry before 1925 . Continuation of controls and subsidies maintained operation but left uncertain the destiny of the industry and evaded the central problem of the differences between operators and miners . While the seven-hour day for miners did not last , trade union power was reflected in the change , in 1919 , in working hours throughout most of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and the shortening of the work week from about 54 hours to about 46-48 , with no reduction in wages . The Coalition Government did move positively in two directions , housing and unemployment insurance . Dr. Christopher Addison 's wartime Ministry of Reconstruction had emphasized the dire need for new housing ; at the end of the war the situation was more acute than at the beginning , with normal construction falling far behind and a great proportion of available dwellings unfit for habitation . Local authorities in 1919 declared that at least 400,000 new dwellings were required , an estimate soon stepped up to 800,000 . The Housing and Town Planning Act of July 1919 , sometimes called the Addison Act ( Addison had become the first minister of Health ) , provided for government subsidies through local authorities . Though the initial grants were reduced , under this act some 200,000 houses were constructed by March 1923 . This was hardly more than a beginning ; the really important consequence was that the Ministry of Health , with housing as its chief concern , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a necessary prelude to any larger program of construction . The Addison Act of 1919 encountered little opposition . Nor did the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1920 , for the principle involved had been established in 1911 . During the war , application was extended to munitions workers and after the war temporarily to soldiers and industrial workers displaced by demobilization . The 1920 act provided for joint contribution from employer and employee ; after twelve weeks ' contribution the worker was entitled to benefits for fifteen weeks in a year ( fifteen shillings for men , twelve shillings for women ) . Some eleven million workers , including eight million not previously insured , were brought within the scope of the act ? all those earning less than ? 250 a year , save domestic servants , farm laborers , and civil servants . No one in // 1920 could foresee that almost immediately the act would be invoked on a vast scale . The contributory system broke down , but the principle of state aid was now generally accepted . " Extended benefit " was created to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insurance system soon became the unfortunate " dole . " Very shortly the system became utter chaos , with a mass of piecemeal legislation concerning contributions and benefits . Settlement of the Irish Question More than any other single issue the Irish question dominated politics during 1918 ? 22 and determined the fortunes of the Coalition . In 1918 the Irish voted for independence in electing under the banner of Sinn Fein seventy-three members of the British Parliament . On January 7 , 1919 , twenty-six of them gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin and formed an independent assembly , Dail Eireann . Most of the others , including Eamon de Valera , elected president of the new state , were in British jails . " The Troubles " ensued , with a state of undeclared war between Irish Volunteers , who had become the I.R.A . ( Irish Republican Army ) , and the R.I.C. ( Royal Irish Constabulary ) , the latter soon reinforced by special British police wearing Khaki uniforms and black helmets ( the " Black and Tans " ) . While the ordinary pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sudden death , ambush , roadblocks , terrorizing by day and sudden raids by night , hunger strikes , torture , arbitrary imprisonment , jail breaking ? developed another bizarre and tragic chapter in Irish history . Sections of the British press , such as The Times , the Manchester Guardian , and the Daily Mail , were shocked to find the British Government meeting foul means with foul . The prime minister , fumbling for a solution , first thought in terms of home rule and would go no further . A Bill for the Better Government of Ireland , introduced in 1919 , provided for partition and home rule , with one Parliament for the South and another for Ulster . When this bill became law at the end of 1920 , terrorism still was unbridled . Fortunately , a new and different note was soon introduced . On June 22 , 1921 , George V went to Belfast to inaugurate the new Parliament for Ulster . Guided by the counsel of General Smuts , prime minister of South Africa , the king used the occasion to appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join in making the land they love a new era of peace , contentment and good will . " His biographer , Harold Nicolson , declared that this address " inaugurated a new and wiser stage in the whole disordered story . " This comment appears justified . The next step was a truce drawn up in Dublin , effective July 11 . A few days before , General Smuts , as " Mr. // Smith , " made a secret visit to Dublin and urged De Valera to negotiate . De Valera headed an Irish delegation which arrived in London , July 12 , for a ten-day stay . Lloyd George now took the long step of offering De Valera " dominion status " while insisting upon Irish allegiance to the British Crown , safeguards for British defense in Ireland , and recognition of the right of the Government of Northern Ireland to determine its own future . De Valera , in various and somewhat conflicting counterproposals , was willing to accept " external association with the British Commonwealth Group , " but adhered tenaciously to the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for all of Ireland . On this impasse the negotiations broke down . In October they were renewed in London without De Valera , who remained in Ireland perhaps as a matter of strategy . The Irish delegation was headed by Arthur Griffith , the creator of Sinn Fein , and Michael Collins , who had been the very soul of I.R.A . activity . Though dedicated to the Irish cause , they were not extremists . The chief negotiators for the British Government were Lloyd George , Austen Chamberlain , Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill . It was auspicious that each group promptly came to like and respect the other . But the discussions were dramatic in the extreme and repeatedly seemed about to collapse . The principals all played important and almost equally decisive roles . But it would appear that it was Lloyd George who saved the situation ; his charm , his understanding of human nature , his resourcefulness , and even his capacity for effective bluff were used to consummate advantage . At one crucial point , on the all-important issue of the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission to determine the boundary line on the basis of local sentiment . It was bait offered as a lure to the Irish delegation , and by no means an honest gesture on Lloyd George 's part . After all expedients seemed exhaused , at 7:30 on the evening of December 5 , 1921 , he confronted the Irish delegation with a choice between accepting a treaty of agreement or a state of war . At 2:30 the following morning the Irish delegation , which had no power of plenipotentiary , affixed their signatures to an agreement providing for the Irish Free State with dominion status and a separate Parliament in Ulster if northern Ireland so decreed . The Irish Dail endorsed the agreement , but by a narrow margin , 64 to 57 . The Irish Nationalists were divided . De Valera and his followers repudiated any and all allegiance to the Crown and insisted on a republic with mere " external association " with Britain . The other element , led by Griffith and Collins , accepted independence and dominion status as an honorable settlement which would enable Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the summer of 1922 Sir Henry Wilson , retired chief of the Imperial General Staff and popularly thought // of as behind Ulster 's resistance to the Free State , was shot and killed at the entrance to his London house , and Michael Collins was slain in Ireland . But in December 1922 Saorstat Eireann , literally translated as the Irish Free State , was established , a settlement which continued without modification until 1937 . It was Lloyd George 's one great postwar achievement . He had succeeded in his dual policy of preventing either section of Ireland from coercing the other and yet of keeping both within the Empire . George V , in extending congratulations , recalled that many years before , Lord Morley had said that the day would come when Conservatives would grant home rule . To this final solution , which went far beyond the original proposals of Gladstone and of Asquith , the Unionist Birkenhead , Austen Chamberlain , Curzon and Balfour all gave their support . But not Carson , now a law lord , who with Birkenhead and Bonar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and Birkenhead had a bitter exchange in the House of Lords . " Of all men in my experience that I think are the most loathsome it is those who will sell their friends to conciliate their enemies , " said Carson . A Tottering Coalition The Irish settlement was the beginning of serious difficulty for the Coalition . It led to consideration in the Cabinet in January 1922 of the possibility of dissolution of Parliament in the thought that a general election would draw the elements of the center more closely together ; if for no other reason , the Coalition would be supported for want of an alternative . Lloyd George soon repudiated the suggestion , but stronger opposition came from those Conservatives who wished to postpone the election until a suitable alternative to the Coalition was provided ? namely , a Conservative Government . The Geddes report added to controversy within the Conservative ranks . In August 1921 a committee had been set up under the chairmanship of Sir Eric Geddes to recommend to the Exchequer all possible reductions in national expenditure . Early in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report as a very remarkable document which would guide the Government in every case except where national security was at stake . The report ( issued that month ) included substantial reductions in expenditures for education and health services as well as for the armed services . The controversy over the merits of the " Geddes axe " once again split- Conservatives , and Lloyd George might well have resigned had he not been bolstered by the support of Austen Chamberlain , since March 1921 the Conservative leader in the Commons . Before the Geddes report was adopted , the controversial economies were greatly reduced . // The Failure of Open Diplomacy . In the end , foreign policy , which had catapulted Lloyd George into the highest office , was the occasion of his downfall . Here , above all , one might well have expected him to succeed ? " the Welsh Wizard , " quick in thought and action , shrewd judge of men , adept at negotiation , and by March 1921 enjoying vast prestige as the only survivor in office of the Big Four at Versailles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European politics . Lloyd George 's general policy was constructive in that it was conciliatory , sought to perpetuate peace , establish mutual good will , and restore normal economic intercourse . And he was confident enough , for he proposed to bypass the devious methods of the " old diplomacy " and solve problems by direct discussion in open conference . During the years 1919 ? 22 in some twenty-three full-dress diplomatic conferences , the political heads of the states of Europe came together . Lloyd George 's policy achieved partial success at the Washington Arms Conference of 1921 ? 22 ; on capital ships the famous ratio of approximately 5 : 5 : 3 : 1.75 : 1.75 was adopted for the United States , Great Britain , Japan , France , and Italy , respectively . Great Britain was to reduce her strength by 40 percent . This was the first step in Britain 's surrender of naval supremacy . But this was in full accord with the Ten Year Rule set forth by the war cabinet back in 1919 that " it should be assumed for framing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in any great war during the next ten years . " And the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 , renewed in 1911 , was not again renewed in 1922 . Though Britain 's role in the Far East deteriorated , her association with the United States was strengthened . However , in European diplomacy ? in the difficult questions of reparations , inter-Allied war debts ( especially obligations to the United States ) , and general disarmament one conference merely passed the problems on to the next . The central point at issue was French and British policy toward Germany . In the interests of her national security , France sought strict enforcement of the Versailles treaty , while Britain , with her economic well-being at stake , strove to implement the treaty , even revise it , with a view to stabilizing Germany politically and economically . The climax of failure came at Cannes and Genoa . At the Cannes Conference ( January 1922 ) of Lloyd George , Premier Briand of France , and the premiers of Belgium and Italy , a satisfactory solution seemed within reach . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with his successor , Raymond Poincare , who turned from the Great Powers to the smaller states , particularly those in the Little Entente ( Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , and Romania ) ; and the ambitious Genoa Conference of April and May , so carefully arranged by Lloyd George , and representing thirty-four countries , including Germany and Russia , but without Poincare , was sheer failure . // Crisis in the Near East . Then came the Turkish question . In 1918 , with the total defeat of the Ottoman Empire , there seemed to be no issue in the Near East that the diplomats could not solve . But soon to the comparatively simple problem of partitioning the Ottoman Empire were added special claims submitted by the Greeks and uncertainties over the future of Constantinople , and confusion confounded in the successful Nationalist revolution within Turkey under Mustapha Kemal . The Treaty of Sevres ( 1920 ) , drawn up in the midst of this rapidly changing situation , was doomed as soon as it was signed . And the new problems posed soon gave to this latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance . In British politics the basic difficulty was that while Lloyd George was pro-Greek to the point of romanticism , the Conservatives in his Government were pro-Turk . This conflict of attitude came to a head in the Chanak episode . The Treaty of Sevres had provided a neutral zone on both the Asiatic and the European sides of the critical area of the Straits . In the summer of 1922 the Greek Government recalled from Anatolia some of its units confronting the Turkish army of Mustapha Kemal and sought permission to occupy Constantinople in the neutral area . Permission was refused , though Lloyd George in the Commons spoke words of encouragement to the Greeks . The partial withdrawal of Greek troops had inspired a Turkish offensive in Anatolia ; the remaining Greek troops were routed and the Turks in September moved into the neutral zone on the Asiatic side of the Straits . In this area , near the Dardanelles , British units were stationed at Chanak , where Turkish troops were soon " grin ning through the barbed wire . " Lloyd George asked for support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on September 15 sent out an alarm to the dominions requesting them to be prepared to lend a hand if needed . Lloyd George promptly found himself in trouble . France and Italy at once recalled their troops from the neutral zone . The dominion Governments , showing rather less than enthusiasm , requested consultation in thr formulation of policy and declared that in the present emergency their own Parliaments must be consulted . At home Lloyd George had Cabinet support only from Churchill and Birkenhead . The prime minister indeed had bypassed his foreign secretary , Lord Curzon . At Chanak the restraint of the British commander , General Harington , and the good judgment of Mustapha Kemal ( he could well afford a little patience , for he was steadily nearing his goal ) prevented hostilities . By October an agreement ended the crisis and the Treaty of Lausanne ( 1923 ) soon replaced Sevres , Matters were patched up with France . Very likely Lord George 's polity had more to do with checking Mustapha Kemal in 1922 than his malty detractors have recognized . Harold Nicolson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daring displayed by Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill in thus saving Great Britain from humiliation . " Churchill himself wrote in The World Crisis that British policy " prevented the renewal of war in Europe . " The End of a Career ? Whatever its merits , Lloyd George 's policy contributed to an untenable position at home . By the end of the summer of 1922 he was increasingly on the defensive . He had failed on the problem of reparations . The " honors scandal " was mounting . Since 1918 an increasing number of peerages , baronetcies , and knighthoods had gone to businessmen and newspaper men , a circumstance which aroused suspicions of connections with party funds . In the summer of 1922 this matter was sent to a parliamentary committee of inquiry . And now the policy in the Near East was opposed by a hostile public whose enthusiasm for Greece waned with the restoration of the pro-German King Constantine after the war . The active revolt began in August 1922 when some of the younger Conservatives in the Ministry confronted their party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a party policy within the Coalition . In September the movement was stimulated by rumors that the Cabinet contemplated dissolution of Parliament before there would be opportunity for criticism of its policy at the annual conference of the Conservative Party scheduled for November . After the Chanak crisis , party veterans joined the revolt . On October 7 The Times printed a letter from Bonar Law , wherein he , in effect , dissociated himself from Lloyd George 's policy in the Near East . Soon after , Lord Curzon and Lord Salisbury committed themselves against Lloyd George . On the morning of October 19 , some 275 Conservative members of the House of Commons met at the Carlton Club to decide their future . Austen Chamberlain , their parliamentary leader , without airing his own hostile views of Lloyd George , pleaded for maintenance of the Coalition , and in so doing sacrificed favorable prospects of becoming prime minister himself . His remarks brought only scattered applause . There was even less enthusiasm for Balfour 's appeal for loyalty to the prime minister . Honors of the occasion went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently undecided until just the day before , but now ready to make a bid for leadership , spoke rather subtly of the disastrous effects on party organization which continued association with the Coalition would mean and announced that he would vote against it . More interesting was the sudden prominence of Baldwin . He had been in the cabinet ( as president of the Board of Trade ) only since March 1921 . He had never // been enthusiastic for the Coalition , born of " the infamous election " of 1918 , as he termed it . Now , in straightforward language , he put the case against maintaining this connection . He agreed that Lloyd George was a " dynamic force . " But " a dynamic force is a very terrible thing ; it may crush you , but it is not necessarily right . It is owing to that dynamic force ... that the Liberal Party , to which he formerly belonged , has been smashed to pieces ; and it is my firm conviction that , in time , the same thing will happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from'the start ; the Conservatives voted 185 to 88 to contest the next election as an independent party . At five o'clock that afternoon Lloyd George resigned , and a few days later Bonar Law was selected as Conservative leader ; he kissed hands as the new prime minister . Lloyd George 's career as Cabinet member was over . He was but fiftynine . His failures after 1918 were not solely of his own making . His very achievements were , ironically , unfortunate politically . But he was always one to claim credit when success came . And he promised much . Perhaps it was rough justice that now he should have to accept responsibility for failure . He was not the man to provide leadership for a coalition government in peacetime , for he had earned the loyalty of no one . Alistair Cooke in a television comment in 1975 declared that Lloyd George brought the downfall of the Liberal Party ? for a simplified statement , about as good as any . There is general consensus in judgments about him . His methods nearly always aroused suspicions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are endless . " Nobody is bound by a speech , " was his own response to questions about war aims . Viscount Samuel in his Memoirs remarks : Lloyd George was " a strange amalgam of opposite qualities . Quite sincere in his passion for social progress as an end , there was in him a strain of cynicism as to the means ? and indeed towards life in general ? which lessened the confidence he could command . " To Beatrice Webb he was " a blatant intriguer , " and a generally friendly Beaverbrook remarked : " He did not seem to care which way he travelled , providing he was in the driver 's seat . " His personal and family life was as stormy as his political life ? the details became general knowledge only some years after his death . Frances Stevenson , Lloyd George 's secretary since 1912 , was also his mistress ? she relates the story in her autobiography , The Years that are Past ( 1967 ) . In 1942 she became his second wife . If you try to characterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a warm , ebullient , and resilient personality ; friendly and accessible to all ; a genius at the conference table ( had he remained in office , he might have prevented the crisis in the Ruhr ) ; a radical idealist in his humanity ; a sheer opportunist in politics . In the end one must have admiration for the extraordinary career which carried him from a small Welsh village to world prominence . In the words of a leading historian of // the period , Charles Loch Mowat : " Thus ended the reign of the great ones , the giants of the Edwardian era and of the war ; and the rule of the pygmies , of the second-class brains ' began , to continue until 1940 . " Three Elections in Three Years Bonar Law formed a Cabinet with what elements he could find ( thirteen Conservative ministers in the Coalition refused to join ) and promptly ( November 15 ) went to the country . His election manifesto has become famous : " The crying need of the nation at this moment ... is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad so that free scope should be given to the initiative and enterprise of our citizens , for it is in that way far more than by any action of the Government that we can hope to recover from the economic and social results of the war . " On this appeal for " tranquility " his party carried 347 seats , a clear majority of 87 . But though 5,500,000 voted Conservative , 8,300,000 voted for candidates of other parties . Labor swelled its ranks in the House of Commons to 142 with over 4,000,000 popular votes ; its victories included the reappearance of MacDonald and Snowden and the election for the first time of Clement Attlee . The rapidly rising constituency of Labor was now manifest , including the emergence of a strong socialist element , the Clydesiders from the Glasgow area , with 21 victories out of 28 contests . With good reason C. P. Scott said to Lloyd George the day of the election : " The Liberal Party if it is to count for anything will have to be in the full sense Radical with strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable popular vote ( over 4,000,000 ) , their 117 seats were about evenly divided between the Coalition Liberals ( now known as the National Liberals ) and the Independent Liberals , led by Asquith ( he had returned to the Commons in 1920 in a by-election . ) One of the Liberal candidates , Winston Churchill , convalescing from an appendectomy , ran a poor fourth at Dundee , where two were elected . The Search for Conservative Leadership Bonar Law remained in office only until May 1923 , when a chronic throat condition , finally diagnosed as cancer , forced his resignation . He died in October and , rather surprisingly , his ashes were buried in the Abbey . Tributes in Parliament were a little forced , but he was genuinely praised as a man of great courage in the face of family tragedy . Few writers have been able to follow his career with much warmth . As the leader of the Commons after December 1916 , he was // more valuable to Lloyd George than is generally recognized ; and he had real gifts as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters he was a person of narrow views and limited interests , distrustful of enthusiasm and idealism , uninterested in ideas . He was not a man to inspire others . Lord Curzon , deputy prime minister and leader of the House of Lords , had every expectation to succeed . His Excellency the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston was a rather fabulous person ? twenty-five years back , at the age of thirty-nine , he had been viceroy of India ; now , as foreign secretary , he was again in the ascendant . He had just returned triumphant from Lausanne . Bonar Law resigned on Sunday , May 20 , and had requested that the king not seek his advice as to his successor . However , a memorandum , unsigned but actually written by one of the private secretaries of Bonar Law and purporting to express his own views , reached the king 's hands . This memorandum urged the claims of Stanley Baldwin , the chancellor of the Exchequer , and probably had some weight with the king , though Bonar Law 's biographer argues persuasively that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bonar Law , we are told , expected Curzon to be named . Lord and Lady Curzon were spending the weekend at one of their several estates , Montacute in Somerset . They had no telephone . On Monday Curzon received a brief note from Bonar Law with word of his resignation . That evening a telegram arrived from the king 's private secretary , Lord Stamfordham , summoning him to London . It could mean but one thing : the king would ask him to form a government . However , the next day when Lord Stamfordham called at Carlton Terrace , the Curzon town house , it was only to inform him that Stanley Baldwin had been selected . Curzon was stunned . " I was present , " Lady Curzon writes , " and George could not restrain his tears . " Baldwin was " a man of no experience ... and of the utmost insignificance , " cried Curzon . So , like Austen Chamberlain in Beaverbrook 's phrase , he " stumbled on the threshold of 10 Downing Street . " There were several reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature after his resignation in 1905 as viceroy of India , brought on by his autocratic ways . He very much lacked the confidence of his Cabinet associates , many of whom heartily disliked him . Beaverbrook 's chapter in Men and Power on " His Royal Pomp " is harsh but properly calls attention to Curzon 's long record of disloyalty to his friends , notably in 1911 , when he deserted Balfour ; in 1916 , when he deserted Asquith ; and in 1922 , when he deserted Lloyd George . In the king 's mind , reinforced by advice from several quarters , apparently the chief consideration was that the prime minister should not be in the Lords . " The difficulty today would he // insuperable , " the king said to Lady Curzon . Curzon remained as foreign secretary . G. M. Young says that Stanley Baldwin became prime minister because no one better was available . This is a fair statement . Though in Parliament since 1908 , for years he made little impression ? he was under ordinary circumstances not an effective speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exchequer appointed Baldwin the financial secretary . As president of the Board of Trade in 1921 he became generally popular . " Patience , good humor and an unexpected readiness in answering questions are gifts to which the House of Commons always responds " ( G. M. Young ) . Then in 1922 chancellor of the Exchequer under Bonar Law , Baldwin rapidly rose in Cabinet and public esteem . Soon after the completion of the American debt settlement , in a foreign policy debate ( February 16 , 1923 ) , he made a characteristic speech , concluding with these words : It is no good trying to cure the world by repeating that penta-syllabic French derivative , " Proletariat " . . . . The English language is the richest in the world in monosyllables . Four words of one syllable each are words which contain salvation for this country and the whole world . They are " Faith , " " Hope , " " Love " and " Work . " No Government in this country today which has not faith in the people , hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which will not work and work and work , will ever bring this country through into better days and better times , or will ever bring Europe through or the world through . It is a speech which Baldwin 's admirers often quote . Here , as his biographer said in another connection , was " a simple earnestness which brought the issue , whatever it might be , within the moral comprehension of the common listener . " Curzon could not possibly have spoken in such a manner . The man in the street recognized in Baldwin one of his own kind . But for some time his position politically was insecure . Within six months of taking office he dissolved Parliament and staged the surprise election of December 1923 . In the interim months the Government moved uncertainly ? a cartoon in October showed the prime minister " just gliding about . " Curzon continued his brilliant management of British interests in Turkey , but the French occupation of the Ruhr ( 1923 ) in default of reparations deliveries brought the Anglo-French Entente almost to an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government subsidy but under conditions which put the new construction out of the reach of the working class . In 1923 unemployment still stood at 13 percent , with insurance and relief funds seriously depleted . // Baldwin concluded that the most urgent problem was political ? the first requirement for effective Government policy was a stronger and more united Conservative Party , with such dissidents as Chamberlain , Birkenhead , and Balfour back in the fold . To this end he boldly proposed , as party policy , a return to a protective tariff . During the war a bare beginning in that direction had been made with the limited McKenna duties ( 33.3 percent ad valorem duties on cars , motorcycles , watches , musical instruments ) , and in 1921 the key industries duties had applied tariffs to precision instruments and chemicals . Otherwise , free trade still prevailed . Baldwin himself was protectionist by principle . At Plymouth on October 25 , 1923 , he proposed protection of the home market as a means of fighting unemployment . A week later in the Free Trade Hall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal reform . Only a year before , Bonar Law had pledged " no fundamental change in the fiscal system " ; and so to secure a fresh mandate Baldwin determined upon a general election . The decision was his alone . There is evidence that he acted quickly to forestall a tactical move by Lloyd George in favor of protection . Many of Baldwin 's fellow Conservatives ( notably Curzon , Birkenhead , and Lord Derby ) were outraged at his casual manner . The king was also gravely concerned and told Baldwin that he thought it was a serious mistake to plunge the country into a domestic dispute over free trade when the European situation was so critical . Table Baldwin 's majority in the Commons , which without the election he might have retained for four more years , had vanished . He had acted contrary to the advice of the Cabinet and apparently without regard for the consequences . The Conservatives now dropped the issue of protection , which was not to be revived for some eight years . But there were , even in December 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing of Conservative ranks and complete separation from Coalition Liberals . Even before the polling , Chamberlain and Birkenhead were negotiating for a return to the Cabinet . On the face of it , however , the election had two quite different results . The transformation in political affiliations , and , in particular , the crystal181 Three Elections in Three Years lization of attitudes of the vastly enlarged electorate after 1918 , gave Labor its first opportunity " to govern . " But at the same time , the revival of the issue of protection reunified those who still called themselves Liberal . The portrait of Lloyd George had been brought out of hiding and rehung in the National Liberal Club , and he and Asquith had issued a joint election manifesto for free trade . Second , no party emerged with a majority . The Liberals held the balance of power . In certain Conservative and Liberal circles it was widely proclaimed that a Labor Government would be a disaster . Balfour advised Baldwin to accommodate himself in some fashion to Asquith ; and Churchill ( again among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to considerable lengths to prevent Labor from coming to power . But this Baldwin never seriously considered ; an agreement with Lloyd George was beyond the realm of possibility ; moreover , Baldwin was quite prepared to let Labor make use of its opportunity . And George V , contrary to some Labor accusations , was insistent that if the Government lost control of Parliament he must send for the leader of the Opposition . Asquith soon made his own position clear . He had no intention of forming a coalition with the Conservatives when the election had turned on the issue of free trade . The only alternative to a Conservative Government was a Labor Government , and this prospect caused him no alarm . On December 18 he told the Liberals of the newly elected House that it was a novel experience to be proclaimed as a potential " saviour of society . " He added , " If a Labour Government is ever to be tried in this country , as it will be sooner or later , it could hardly be tried under safer conditions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that , if asked , he would try to form a Government . When Parliament met in January 1924 , Asquith supported the Labor amendment of " no confidence " to the address from the throne , and the Baldwin Government was out by seventy-two votes . MacDonald was summoned to the palace . The king recorded in his diary , " I had an hour 's talk with him ; he impressed me very much ; he wishes to do the right thing . Today 23 years ago dear Grandmama died . I wonder what she would have thought of a Labour Government . " The Cabinet and Problems of a Minority . On January 8 Duff Cooper went to the Labor victory demonstration in the Albert Hall and found it " a very tame show with no note of revolution . " There was little sign of radicalism in the Cabinet organized by MacDonald . The selections were mainly his , despite the clamor of other voices in the party . For some offices he was hard put to find suitable candidates , particularly for the law offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few offices , though 136 of the 192 Labor members in the new Parliament had been associated with manual labor , 46 of them with coal mines . But Robert Smillie , the miners ' president until 1921 , refused office , and elsewhere among trade unionists talent was limited . Finding it difficult to dispose of the Foreign Office ( the country was briefly astounded by the rumor that it might go to J. H. Thomas , a party stalwart but totally unfit for that office ) , MacDonald retained it for himself . Several ex-Liberals were included , notably Lord Haldane , who with mingled pleasure and misgiving became lord chancellor , and Charles Trevelyan , who became president of the Board of Education . Two were selected from the militant socialists , the very able John Wheatley from Clydeside in the Ministry of Health and the Bradford I.L.P. leader , F. W. Jowett , in the Ministry of Works . Arthur Henderson insisted on the Home Office and got it . Everything considered , it was about as good a Cabinet as could have been assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admiralty ( he was a former viceroy of India ) had had previous government experience . The swearing in at Buckingham Palace was an event unique of its kind , with " Wheatley ? the revolutionary ? going down on both knees and actually kissing the king 's hand " ( Beatrice Webb ) . Notwithstanding the limited character of Labor 's electoral victory and the predominance of moderates in the new Cabinet , it was a historic occasion . Twenty-four years after the formation of the L.R.C. in 1900 , the Labor Party had polled some 4,350,000 votes , had elected two-fifths of the House of Commons , and had formed a Government . Working-class people thought of MacDonald as the man of the hour and looked forward to great achievement . Presumably Labor could count on support from the Liberals . But with the Liberals themselves so scattered in their sympathies it was problematical just what that support would mean in practice . Asquith himself was enjoying a renewed sense of power in holding the balance between the two major parties . And , taking the long view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary ; indeed , Labor was seeking to replace the Liberals in the body politic . But the immediate day-to-day problems of the new Government lay in the inexperience of the new ministers , in their inability to master the routine of their respective departments , and in their failure to agree on priorities in Government policy ( for example , just when should unemployment be tackled ? ) . The prime minister took office enjoying the respect and admiration of most of his colleagues , but there was no real esprit de corps in the Cabinet , some members of which had opposed MacDonald for party leadership after the election of 1922 . But perhaps MacDonald 's chief limitation as prime minister in 1924 was in his failure to establish good rapport with the members of his party in Parliament . // Policies , Domestic and Foreign . In domestic matters the Labor Government scored very limited success . The Cabinet seemed diffident about enunciating novel policies . For one thing , the general idea seemed to be that " we must not annoy the Civil Service . " Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget in 1924 which , it has been said , was more Cobdenite than socialist . He abolished the McKenna duties held over after the war , and he reduced taxes . The Liberals were lyrical in his praise . Snowden 's financial caution , which henceforth dominated his attitudes and policies , was entirely unexpected . But the fact is he never would produce money to finance public works designed to fight unemployment . On unemployment , indeed , the Government did nothing save take refuge in such phrases as " socialism is the only cure . " The Ministry of Labor was occupied with strikes as frequently under this regime as under the former . A brighter aspect was the creative energy in the Ministry of Health , where John Wheatley and his chief aide , Arthur Greenwood , produced an Housing Act ( August 1924 ) significant for its new scheme of subsidies to local authorities for housing to be rented to the working class at regulated rates . This legislation proved to be basic for council housing between the wars . But it was in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquand , in the latest and best biography of MacDonald , emphasizes his " virtuoso performance . " At international conferences MacDonald 's fine presence , his good mind and elegant manners , served him and his country well . Labor now dropped its talk about revising Versailles . With the assistance of financial experts and with a happy turn of affairs in France which replaced Poincare with Herriot , MacDonald was able at the London Conference ( July 1924 ) to set in operation the Dawes Plan ( also known as the Experts Plan ) for reparation payments and to make arrangements for the evacuation of the Ruhr . At the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva in September , Arthur Henderson and Lord Parmoor helped implement proposals of MacDonald and Herriot , in the formulation of the protocol to the League Covenant providing for compulsory arbitration of international disputes . ( Labor was out of office before the protocol came up for ratification . ) In these matters there was something like a bipartisan policy , with Baldwin kept thoroughly informed and with continuity of policy from his administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Russia ran into trouble and in the end brought the Government down . The Soviet Union was formally recognized a week after Labor took office . This set the stage for a mounting attack on Government policy toward Russia which paralleled the long , drawn-out negotiations , begun in mid-April , producing a commercial treaty and a general treaty setting prewar claims // of British citizens in Russia . The latter was a complicated document which included a clause guaranteeing a British loan to Russia upon the formal signing of this treaty . The announcement , August 6 , of the initialing of these agreements was the signal for a concerted attack by the Conservatives soon reinforced by Lloyd George and many of his fellow Liberals . The treaties were in some details vulnerable , but they represented a measure of achievement in the face of great difficulty in an area in which it was imperative that progress be made ( the resumption of normal trade relations with Russia ) . The Labor Government in the autumn session could hardly have survived an attempt to get these agreements ratified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the " Campbell case . " J. R. Campbell , Communist editor of the Workers ' Weekly , published an article ( now attributed by a Communist historian to the Communist leader in England , Harry Pollitt ) which seemed to urge British factory workers to refuse to participate in wars against their fellow workers in other lands . Campbell was charged with incitement to mutiny , but the attorney-general shortly withdrew the charges with the explanation that the article in question was merely " a comment upon armed military force being used by the State to repress industrial disputes . " It was suggested that the withdrawal of charges was for political reasons . In answer to a question in Parliament , September 30 , MacDonald denied that he had been consulted by the law officers . The Conservatives thereupon gave notice of a vote of censure and the Liberals of a demand for an investigation by a select committee of inquiry . MacDonald , rather surprisingly , announced that he would consider the matter one of a question of confidence in his Government . We now know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part , but rather that he was under great pressure both in the Cabinet and in the Parliamentary Labor Party to meet the challenge . Indeed , Labor was tired of being a minority Government . The Cabinet agreed that if it were defeated , Parliament would be dissolved . In the debate on October 8 , MacDonald 's explanation did his cause no good ? he admitted that his previous statement had been inaccurate and that , in fact he had discussed the Campbell case with the law officers . Some of his own colleagues ( Snowden and Wheatley ) regarded his remarks as " evasive " and unconvincing . The roll call went against MacDonald , 368 to 198 . He dissolved and called for a general election . It was the third in three years . The Election of 1924 The chief issue of the campaign was the Russian policy of the Labor Government . And the chief incident was the appearance of // the " Zinoviev Letter " in the press , October 25 , just four days before polling , which promptly produced a confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The headline in The Times read : " Soviet Plot . Red Propaganda in Britain . Revolution Urged by Zinoviev . Foreign Office Bombshell . " The letter purported to be a communication dated September 15 from Zinoviev , president of the Comintern in Moscow , addressed to the British Communist Party , advising on tactics for obtaining control of the British Labor Party and launching the revolution . Apparently it was only a copy , not the original , which reached the Foreign Office in some mysterious fashion on October 10 . Learning that the Daily Mail had also somehow secured a copy which it was about to publish , the Foreign Office handed the letter over to The Times with a protest , a statement which tacitly accepted the genuineness of the letter . This was not the act of MacDonald , who was on election tour , but of civil servants in his department . In response , the Russian charge d'affaires in London and Zinoviev himself denied the letter 's authenticity . When the prime minister finally commented ( two days after public knowledge of the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protest issued by his own department , thus playing into the hands of Conservatives and Liberals who took for granted the bona fide character of the letter and exploited the situation to the full . The " Red scare " was tailor-made for their general case of associating the Labor Party with Russian Communism . But excitement over the Zinoviev letter was no more than a manifestation , and that it was the essential cause of Labor 's defeat can not be seriously maintained . The campaign was also notable for the first election addresses by radio . MacDonald did not improve the opportunity by using for the occasion an address to a vast crowd in Edinburgh . Stanley Baldwin spoke quietly and effectively from the studio and , as L. S. Amery tells the story , with Mrs. Baldwin knitting at his side . As a result of the poll , the Labor strength in the Commons dropped to 151 , despite small gains in popular vote largely at Liberal expense . Labor unity at the top was shattered , with MacDonald held by some of the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , it was manifest that Labor had firmly established itself as a major party . For the Liberals the results were disastrous , the campaign marking another stage in their disintegration . Their tactics against the Government had boomeranged , for they emerged with only 42 seats , with their popular vote dropping from 30 percent to 18 percent . Asquith lost to a Laborite in a straight fight at Paisley and on his return journey to London could only solace himself by reading the latest Wodehouse . Winston Churchill finally extricated himself from the Liberal fold and was returned as a " Constitutionalist " with strong Conservative support . For the Conserva186 Aftermath of War tives the result was overwhelming victory with 48 percent of the poll and 414 seats in the Commons ? a gain of 161 . The existence of a Labor government had caused more people to think of politics as either Conservative or Labor , while the emergence of the " Communist " issue led many who normally voted Liberal to vote Conservative to insure Labor 's defeat . Baldwin had quietly regained control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a " new Conservatism . " It is abundantly clear that the scale of the Conservative victory is to be explained by the collapse of the Liberals , from whom the Conservatives wrested more than a hundred seats . But it should be added that the Conservatives polled more working-class votes than did Labor . For the first time since 1918 a party was returned to power without a large majority having voted against it . The two-party system was operating once again .. The new Government was to remain until 1929 . The Quest for Tranquility My own object will have been achieved if I can help dispose of the idea , wheresoever it may exist , that Mr. Baldwin was , as it were , a pygmy who found himself almost by accident in charge of great events , and who discovered that the events were beyond his capacity to direct or even to understand . 1918 ? 1931 ... was not , at the time , felt as charged with doom . We hoped , we worked , hard and faithfully . We even enjoyed ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in 1931 is one of the parlour games of the Faculties of Economics and Politics . 1924-1931 Reputations of public figures have strange adventures ? but few much stranger than that of Stanley Baldwin , with his recognized capacity , achievement , and prestige in the mid-twenties , and the very general disillusion concerning his will to action , his judgment , and his leadership ten years later . If one is inclined to place Baldwin among the " Guilty Men " and associate him closely with the failure of British policy before World War II , then it will not be easy to do justice to the earlier years when he dominated the Conservative Party so impressively . Of one matter we may be quite sure , and that is his extraordinary success in unifying and strengthening his party after the collapse of the Lloyd George Coalition . The Conservatives in 1924 scored the first solid victory for any party since the war . Head-hunting ceased and place hunters were satisfied . During the brief tenure of the first Labor Government , elements in the Conservative Party which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . The new Conservative Cabinet in 1924 included Austen Chamberlain at the Foreign Office and Birkenhead at the India Office , and very soon Balfour as lord president of the Council . Baldwin 's most surprising success was in the installation at the Exchequer of Winston Churchill , who only a year before had referred to the Baldwin Government as " brainless , spineless and dangerous . " Churchill was himself startled ? " the vicissitudes of politics are inexhaus-188 // tible , " he remarked , quoting Disraeli . Still a staunch free-trader , Churchill was no doubt under considerable suspicion in a Conservative Cabinet . But " he would be more under control inside than out , " commented Baldwin to Neville Chamberlain . And Baldwin was happy to have Lloyd George isolated . To get rid of Lloyd George ? this , Maurice Cowling concludes , was one of three great decisions made by the Conservative Party . The others were to take up the fight against " socialism " and to make Labor its chief antagonist in politics . With each of these Baldwin was closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually recognized . His attitude toward Labor was both sympathetic and antagonistic . Like certain Tory leaders before him ( particularly Disraeli and Joseph Chamberlain ) , Baldwin accepted many of the aims of the working-class movement , a concern , in his case , partly grounded in a religious , even evangelical , outlook . He was prepared to accept the Labor Party as a responsible element in British politics , an attitude not shared by many of his close associates . At the same time , Labor and Liberalism must be prevented from uniting . " Baldwinism " But even in the twenties one is brought up sharply by the question of Baldwin 's quality as a national leader , particularly in the context of Britain 's postwar problems . This is a question of his personality , his philosophy of life , his character , his capabilities . In broad terms it is a question of whether he was in the right profession . Many of his contemporaries , his friends included , noted his distaste for business , the long hours spent on the Treasury bench immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking room of the House . He admired F. S. Oliver 's Endless Adventure ( 1930 ) , a brilliant defense of Sir Robert Walpole 's policy of inaction . Even his admirers feel compelled to deal with his " fatal inertia , " his " laziness . " They agree that Baldwin had no policy calculated to lead to a carefully defined objective . But these are long-range observations ; limitations in leadership had not yet manifested themselves in 1924 . The editor of The Times noted that Baldwin was " singularly free from self-advertisement . " To his supporters he was a plain man , perhaps not specially gifted , but one who voiced in terms easily understood what was in the mind of the ordinary man . Lloyd George , though brilliant , had proved erratic , opportunistic , irresponsible . In contrast , Baldwin was patient , modest , trustworthy , conscientious . At the end of 1924 he was in a position to his liking , for his political judgment had been vindicated , he was committed to no particular policy , and circumstances would govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness . Baldwin sought only stability , peace , and good will ; " tranquility " was his goal , and without apology . " Baldwinism " had arrived . It is hardly surprising that direction and initiative were often found elsewhere . In foreign affairs they were provided by Austen Chamberlain . Circumstances were favorable for advancing British interests , since the Dawes Plan for stabilizing German currency had come into effect on September 1 , 1924 . The new Government also inherited the Geneva Protocol , as yet unapproved by Parliament . This " booby trap , " as Lloyd George called it , involved a commitment too general to be acceptable to the Cabinet , which set it aside in preference to a " European protocol . " This policy led to the Locarno pacts of October 1925 , which received but passing notice in a Britain engrossed with the most serious postwar phase of the coal problem . Nevertheless , the details are fascinating . Stresemann and Luther representing Germany , Briand for France , and Chamberlain for Britain met together at Locarno on the Swiss shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press barred , conferences were held in the Palais de Justice , at the bedside of Stresemann who was briefly ill , and during a lake excursion on The Orange Blossom arranged by Briand to celebrate Mrs. Chamberlain 's birthday . Britain , France , Germany , Belgium , and Italy bound themselves to maintain the territorial provisions of Versailles with respect to Germany 's western boundaries and the Rhineland ; Germany 's eastern frontier was to be stabilized by arbitration of disputes . And she was to be admitted to the League of Nations . On the evening of October 16 , the treaties were initialed in the Palais de Justice , and then the statesmen moved toward the windows to watch the twilight gather on Maggiore . It was Austen Chamberlain 's greatest hour and he savored it . He was rewarded with the Garter , and he told the Commons that Locarno was merely the beginning of general European reconciliation . He shared ( with Charles G. Dawes of the United States ) the Nobel Peace Prize for 1925 . A splendid beginning , certainly . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years what has already been said about the twenties in economic terms . For much of the western world , 1925 marked the end of postwar economic crisis ; now for the first time European production moved beyond the 1913 figures . Germany 's economy had stabilized and the United States was moving into the boom years of Calvin Coolidge . At first it appeared that Britain would keep abreast . One essential , it seemed , was " to make the pound look the dollar in the face . " Under Churchill 's direction , but most likely on the initiative of Montagu Norman , the governor of the Bank of England , Britain returned in April 1925 to the prewar sterling parity of ? 1 equals $4.86 . Production began to rise with a slight improvement in // profits and real wages and some decline in unemployment . From 1927 British ship launchings reached 75 percent of the 1911 ? 13 level and amounted to well over half of that throughout the world . But these favorable signs were illusory . While British production as a whole rose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her competitors . The restoration of the prewar gold standard proved a hindrance , especially when Belgium , Poland , and France all returned , in 1926 ? 28 , to gold at low sterling values . For the pound sterling was now overvalued externally about 10 percent ; that is , prices for British goods sold overseas were about 10 percent higher than the level on which they could compete successfully . This was a severe handicap for the staple industries ? coal , textiles , and shipbuilding ? and was particularly injurious to newer industries struggling to get a footing in the foreign market and now even more vulnerable to foreign competition at home . By 1929 the annual volume of British exports was still below the figure for 1913 while the annual value of her exports had declined since the return to gold in 1925 . The value of world exports , generally , since 1925 had increased . The General Strike of 1926 The general strike of May 4-12 , 1926 , may appear to be a climax of the 1920s , as the culmination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic failure , as a watershed in postwar industrial history . A careful examination suggests that this view is not only superficial but wrong . The strike came as a surprise to the nation and it can not be said to have been the deliberate act of the labor world . It came not at the crest of postwar industrial tension , but after the gap between the right and the left had been narrowed , when militant trade unionism was blunted and aggressive Labor Party tactics tamed , when industrial management was beginning to cooperate with organized labor , and when the Conservative Party was under moderate leadership . The strike is deserving of attention not so much as a phase of industrial relations as for what it reveals about England in broader terms ? her leadership , her morale , her energy . Unionism and the Coal Industry Why was there a " general strike " in 1926 ? In the first place , there was the unhappy state of the coal industry . From solving many problems in the nineteenth century , coal had become , as Osbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth . The wages of sin is death , and the nation now reaped the full harvest of a policy of prodigality and indifference to the future which had characterized the industry // before 1914 . Production dropped from 287 million tons in 1913 to 164 million tons in 1921 . The multiplicity of operators contributed to inefficiency ? there were in 1924 about 1,400 separate mining companies , though 323 produced over 84 percent of the coal ; royalties for coal ownership were paid to some 4,000 persons and compensation for other rights ( water and way leaves ) to as many more . Rising cost of production in Britain contrasted with declining cost elsewhere . Competition from electricity and gasoline contributed to the decreased demand for and thus the falling price of coal . The final blow to Britain 's onetime great export trade in coal came with the return to the gold standard in 1925 . The significance of all this to the miner was that if government subsidies were withdrawn , the industry felt justified in paying wages only about 20 percent in advance of 1913 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In coal the rate of unemployment was higher than in any other industry . From their position as one of the best-paid segments of labor , the miners had become one of the poorest . If government support were withdrawn , crisis would be inevitable . A second factor was the character of trade unionism . During the war , " militancy " which demanded " direct action " had been held in check , but it gathered new strength with the end of hostilities and the weak showing of Labor in the election of 1918 . Postwar developments ? the feeling that the Government did not keep faith on the report of the Sankey Commission and the limited success of the railway strike of 1919 and of the coal strike of 1920 ? gave impetus to the Triple Alliance as an agency which might wrest from management the initiative in industrial relations . Trade union militants who had enthusiastically supported MacDonald in 1922 soon lost confidence in him . On the other hand , leadership of the unions of the Triple Alliance did not reflect this strain of militancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired from the presidency of the Miners ' Federation in 1921 ; the general secretary , Frank Hodges , was more the politician than the labor leader . J. H. Thomas , general secretary of the railway men , was no militant and was reportedly on good terms with Lloyd George . Ernest Bevin , from 1921 general secretary of the transport workers , was legalistically minded . Then also , the Triple Alliance had no policy-making body which could represent and commit all three unions . Who had the power to call and to end a strike embracing the three unions ? What would happen if in a dispute the interests of the three unions conflicted ? These contradictions within trade unionism explain many of the developments in the coal industry after the war . Back in February 1921 it was announced that decontrol would come March 31 . Management thereupon declared that wage agreements of 1920 would no longer he honored and new contracts would be negotiated by districts , with sub193 The General Strike of 1926 stantial reduction in wages . The Miners ' Federation demanded a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal pay for equal work . " Negotiations failed and a coal strike began April 1 . The issues enlisted Triple Alliance action , and in short order notices were posted calling for a general strike to begin Friday night , April 15 . At the last moment Hodges was persuaded to accept negotiations for a temporary wage settlement , and the general strike was canceled despite repudiation of Hodges 's decision by the miners ' executive . The miners , still on strike until July , in the end were forced to drop their demand for a national wages pool and to accept a national wages agreement ( administered by districts ) in which wages with a minimum guarantee were geared to profits . Another government subsidy was to slow down the wage reductions . In the trade union world , April 15 , 1921 , went down as " Black Friday . " The Daily Herald declared on April 16 , " Yesterday was the heaviest defeat that has befallen the Labour movement within the memory of man . " For several years thereafter , the 1921 wages agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was improved by heavy coal exports during the French occupation of the Ruhr . But a supplementary agreement in 1924 , more favorable to the miners , proved unworkable after the Ruhr settlement and subsequent losses in the coal market abroad . When the government subsidy ended , the coal operators announced on June 30 , 1925 , the abandonment if the minimal addition to the standard wage in effect since 1921 ; the alternative , said management , was a return to an eight-hour day underground . The new wage scale was promptly rejected by the miners with the support of the officials of the Trades Union Congress ; the new scale , they said , guaranteed profits and not wages . At first the Government ruled another subsidy out of the question ; but the whole trade union movement rallied to the support of the miners , and Baldwin soon gave way and announced an extension of the subsidy for nine months . In the interim still another royal commission would make inquiry . This settlement was announced on Friday , July 31 ? " Red Friday " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the Government given way ? Baldwin 's answer a few years later : " We were not ready . " The Samuel Commission and the End of Negotiations The chairman of the new commission was Sir Herbert Samuel , the Liberal statesman who had been high commissioner in Palestine , 1920-25 . With him were appointed men of prominence and reputation who likewise had no connections with the coal industry : Sir William Beveridge ( director of the London School of Economics ) , Sir Herbert // Lawrence ( a banker ) , and Kenneth Lee ( a cotton manufacturer ) . For six months they labored ? one of the most strenuous periods in their lives , Samuel and Beveridge remarked . Their unanimous report , issued March 10 , 1926 , sold 100,000 copies in pamphlet form , Samuel tells us . The report was generally favorable to the miners in proposing nationalization of coal royalties , amalgamation of small collieries , and numerous reforms such as a national wages board , family allowances , and improved working conditions . But the commission also declared its conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being , therefore , a wage cut was inevitable and much to be preferred to the return to an eight-hour day . The wage cuts should fall on the highest-paid categories and should not affect those whose wages were already at a subsistence level . However , it should remain with the miners to choose between reduced wages and a longer workday . The ensuing controversy can not be reconstructed with any completeness , for no detailed record was kept of many of the conferences . Misunderstanding developed among the miners and among the operators , as well as between them , as to what was proposed and what was acceptable . The Samuel Commission had made no specific legislative proposals for implementing the recommendations on reorganization of the industry . Consequently , discussion focused on elimination of the government subsidy and on reduction of wages . On these matters the Miners ' Federation was adamant . " Not a penny off the pay , not a minute on the day " became the slogan . The president was now Herbert Smith , a man of few words . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nowt doin . " The new secretary was A. J. Cook , more emotional and more voluble but equally uncompromising , and a man of some Communist leanings besides . Smith and Cook were convinced that if they could force the continuation of the government subsidy , nationalization of the industry would inevitably follow . They were receptive to a proposal worked out by T.U.C. officials with Baldwin for coal industry reorganization , but they insisted that reorganization must be under way before any wage reductions could be accepted . Mine operators were equally stubborn and would offer but one concession ? a return to the eight-hour day and a new national wages agreement on the 1921 model . This proposal , announced April 30 , was rejected by the miners the same day . That night at midnight , lockout notices at the mines went into effect ; existing wage agreements had expired . The next day ( May 1 ) some 828 executive officers of unions affiliated with the T.U.C. met in Memorial Hall and voted overwhelmingly ( in terms of union membership the vote was 3,653,527 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of the miners ( that is , a strike in certain trades ) and for granting full power to the General Council of the // T.U.C. to settle the dispute . But these resolutions , without clarification , proved ambiguous . Exactly what power with reference to the miners ' demands had been delegated to the General Council of the T.U.C. ? This was a matter of some moment , if the General Council should prove more conciliatory than the miners ' officials . But the first action of the General Council was to set midnight , May 3 , as the hour for the strike to take effect . But now it was the General Council of the T.U.C. and not the Miners ' Federation which renewed negotiations with the Government . By the early hours of Sunday , May 2 , agreement had been reached on a general formula calling for a cancellation of strike notices , continuation of the subsidy for two weeks , and settlement of the coal dispute within the framework of the Samuel report . Confusion now followed upon confusion . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was discovered that they had all left London the evening before ; they were recalled but it was Sunday evening before they returned . Throughout the day no further word reached the Cabinet from the General Council of the T.U.C. It has been suggested that Baldwin , now exhausted by the protracted discussions , gave way to the extremists in the Government . Late Sunday evening , just as the general formula was about to be set down in more precise terms , Baldwin suddenly summoned T.U.C. officials to the Cabinet room and handed them a memorandum which declared that since " overt acts have already taken place , " the Government could not resume negotiations until after " repudiation of the actions referred to ... and an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of instructions for a general strike . " Baldwin presumably had in mind the refusal that evening of printers on the staff of the Daily Mail to print an editorial denouncing the looming strike as " a revolutionary movement " which could not be tolerated by " any civilised Government . " It was a trivial incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T.U.C. officials in consultation with the miners ' representatives drew up a statement denying any responsibility for the Daily Mail incident and , armed with this statement , returned to the Cabinet room only to find it empty and in darkness . Baldwin had retired for the night . A. W. Baldwin , the prime minister 's son , in his account adds that the union leaders were apparently unaware that secretaries were available to receive any message . The parliamentary debate the next afternoon ( May 3 ) is surely unique in preliminaries to general strikes . Baldwin for the Government and J. H. Thomas for the T.U.C. spoke with moderation and pleaded for courage , restraint , and good will . Others continued a discussion which extended from four in the afternoon until eleven at night . While this debate was in progress , Thomas met with the attorney general and Baldwin met with representatives of the T.U.C. ? to no avail . At midnight the strike went // into effect . Both management and miners had rejected the Samuel Commission report . The lockout notices posted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a general strike . The necessary condition for a renewal of negotiations on the coal dispute was a simultaneous withdrawal of both lockout and strike notices . Baldwin and the Cabinet made no effort to bring this to pass . It was not literally a general strike but it did affect some 3,000,000 workers ( the total membership in unions affiliated with the T.U.C. was about 4,300,000 ) . Workers called out were the miners , all transport workers , all dockers , all printers , all in steel and chemical trades , all employed in power plants ( save those furnishing light ) , and all engaged in building trades ( save those constructing homes and hospitals ) . The response within these categories was almost unanimous ? altogether , a response far greater than anticipated . A Strike " Under Wraps " As we now look at it , the general strike of 1926 seems a bizarre episode . There was , for example , no clarification as to the purpose of the strike . Trade union leaders repudiated any suggestion of revolutionary intent , referring to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , " It is merely a plain , economic , industrial dispute where the workers say , We want justice , ' said J. H. Thomas in the Commons . J. R. Clynes later referred to it as " a sympathetic strike on an extensive scale . " Even The Times declared ( May 11 ) that few of the strikers had revolution in mind . Yet , what was the point of the strike if not to coerce a duly constituted Government ? And how could it have succeeded except as a revolutionary act ? The Cabinet initially took the position that the intent was indeed coercive . In the debate on May 3 , Winston Churchill said that " either the parliamentary institutions will emerge triumphant ... or ... the existing constitution will be fatally injured . " It is often said that the nine-day strike passed without violence or threat of violence . This is incorrect . The atmosphere of the early days was ominous , with rumor replacing news . In London the king 's Life Guards donned khaki . The second day the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle , an important junction of six thoroughfares on the south side of the Thames , food trucks were attacked and a strikebreaking bus was overturned . Thereafter disorders occurred each evening somewhere in London . Violence broke out elsewhere , notably in Glasgow . Police clashed with strikers . The intemperate official paper , edited by Winston Churchill , demanded " unconditional surrender " by the strikers . Yet it is true that no loss of life can be attributed to the strike , surely another fact almost unique in the history of general strikes . There // was no shooting and there were no barricades . It was on the whole a strike conducted " under wraps . " Strikers themselves alleviated distress . For thousands it was a lark . Strikers played football with the police , and heirs and heiresses and undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge operated busses , lorries , and even railroad trains . The famous convoy ( May 8 ) of one hundred lorries escorted by twenty armored cars manned with troops , dispatched from Hyde Park across London to the docks in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British Worker , a strike sheet issued by the General Council of the T.U.C. , remained moderate . The B.B.C. wireless reports were reliable so far as they went some news was suppressed . George V counseled moderation , and his advice somewhat neutralized pressure on Baldwin from Churchill , Balfour , Neville Chamberlain , and Birkenhead for stronger measures . Had the strike continued for long , its character might have changed . That it ended promptly may be explained by several factors . From the start the Government had a psychological advantage ? ever since " Red Friday " it had assumed the eventuality of a general strike and had in readiness emergency measures , especially government lorries for moving food and transferring goods from the docks . Armed forces were made available , though used sparingly . On the other hand , labor had been caught unprepared . The General Council of the T.U.C. had moved from a position of support for the miners to one of challenge to the Government . Yet neither the Council nor the leaders of the Parliamentary Labor Party wished to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike " unconstitutional . " From a prominent Liberal came the independent support he needed . Sir John Simon , now a lawyer of immense prestige , on the evening of May 6 in the Commons , referred to " this utterly illegal proceeding " which " disregards all contracts of employment ; " this strike , he declared , violated the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 . A few days later his words were confirmed judicially in the High Court of Justice . The nation was prepared to accept this view , and on this mood Baldwin capitalized . On May 8 he broadcast an appeal for an end to the strike and a declaration that all effort would be renewed for dealing with the coal dispute . " Can you not trust me to ensure a square deal for the parties ? to secure justice between man and man ? " By this time it was well known that T.U.C. officials also hoped for an early end . A suitable formula was provided by Sir Herbert Samuel : revision of wages should await " sufficient assurances that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . " But Samuel did not speak for the Government , and Baldwin never accepted this memorandum . The Miners ' Federation , which had not been consulted , rejected it outright . Nevertheless , the General Council of the // T.U.C. found it satisfactory , and a deputation , including Arthur Pugh ( the chairman ) , J. H. Thomas , and Ernest Bevin appeared at 10 Downing Street at noon on May 12 to declare the strike at an end . Bevin pressed for assurances about resumption of negotiations with the miners but was brushed aside by Baldwin 's generalities . That afternoon Baldwin received an ovation in the Commons . He spoke of " a victory of the common sense ... of the best part of the whole of the United Kingdom , and it is of the utmost importance ... that we should resume our work in a spirit of co-operation , putting behind us all malice and all vindictiveness . " The king 's message echoed this plea . Services of reconciliation were held in churches and chapels throughout the land . Baldwin 's broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not cease from Mental Fight , Nor shall my Sword sleep in my Hand Till we have built Jerusalem In England 's green and pleasant Land . The General Strike of 1926 has become a familiar theme with commentators on the English scene , perhaps because of what seems to have been its " un-English character . " Fifty years later , I.T.V. commemorated the event with a daily fifteen-minute program , from May 3 to May 12 , 1976 , a day by day account of what happened ? without comment ? a half century before . Unsolved Issues For Stanley Baldwin the end of the strike was a great personal triumph . He emerged with a prestige and moral authority exceeded in our own time only by that of Churchill during World War II . The Spectator 's comment is representative : " The British people have taken him upon their shoulders and lifted him into a position such as no Prime Minister has occupied since the days of William Pitt . " Only a few weeks before , public sentiment had been overwhelmingly in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Government swung public opinion , at least so far as the general strike was concerned , to the government 's side . The government announced settlement of the strike in terms that suggested unconditional surrender of labor ; the T.U.C. spoke in terms that suggested a labor victory . The workers responded with a sense of relief , but many were bewildered and some were bitter . Relatively few of the workers conceived of the strike as a revolutionary act , but they were almost unanimous in believing in the moral rightness of the miners ' cause and the moral justification of labor 's support for that cause . The return to // work was slow . There was something like " a second general strike , " disordered and disorganized , inspired by indignation with trade union leadership and stimulated by instances of workmen suffering humiliation and reprisal on trying to return to the job . An interesting development came in the by-election in North Hammersmith at the end of the month , when a Conservative seat went Labor by a wide margin over the combined vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British people accepted the outcome of the strike in a burst of patriotic feeling and general good will needs to be well qualified . Inertia and Class Legislation The outcome posed as serious a challenge to the Government as had the strike itself . For now Baldwin 's Cabinet had its chance . Having made and won its point , it was up to the Government to demonstrate wisdom and deal in constructive fashion with the basic issues which led to the strike . What happened ? In a word ? nothing . D. C. Somervell in his critique of G. M. Young 's Stanley Baldwin maintains that in doing absolutely nothing and letting the general strike teach its own lesson , Baldwin pursued the wisest possible course . It is a tenable view if one holds that the strike was a deliberate effort to overthrow constitutional procedures and to coerce the Government into submitting to the miners . But if one concludes that the strike was more the outcome of a chain of circumstances for which many elements shared a responsibility and might well have been prevented by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties to the coal dispute , then the Baldwin policy of inaction is open to serious criticism . In addition to driving home the " lesson " of the strike , which he did in season and out , Baldwin should have just as vigorously sought to implement the statesmanship of the Samuel Commission report . In this situation Baldwin was at his worst ? his efforts were brief , perfunctory , and unsuccessful . He did propose ( May 14 ) reorganization of the industry and a temporary subsidy pending a new wages agreement to be worked out by a national wages board . Unfortunately , he was rebuffed by both sides , and so he distributed rebukes impartially , withdrew the offer , and relinquished the initiative . He then permitted himself to be outmaneuvered by the mine operators and introduced a bill ( emphatically opposed by the Samuel Commission ) for suspending the Seven-hour Day Act , thus permitting the return to an eight-hour day underground . It became law in July . An accompanying Mining Industry Act to facilitate amalgamation of coal companies was passed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued into September , when the Government made further proposals which were re-
