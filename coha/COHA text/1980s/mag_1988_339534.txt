" I do n't think Solomon could solve the problems of Chelsea , " says Carmella Oliver , a parent in the industrial Boston suburb . " Education is not a priority here . " Luckily , it may not take a Solomon  --  just nearby Boston University , which has offered to run the city 's failing school system . The plan , now being debated by the seven-member Chelsea School Committee , could be ratified as soon as next month and go into effect this winter . When that happens , B.U. will become the first private institution in the U.S. to take over and manage a public school system . <P> It has been more than 60 years since a school went up in Chelsea , a crumbling city of 26,000 immigrants and blue-collar workers on Boston Harbor . Even now , with the state offering to pay 90% of the costs , the city board of aldermen refuses to spend local funds for a badly needed high school and elementary school . Language and cultural obstacles compound the system 's problems : over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faced with sagging test scores and a 17% annual dropout rate , many parents and local leaders seem willing to try anything . " What do we have to lose ? " asks school committee chairman Bruce Robinson . <P> Under the university 's rosy rescue proposal , the Chelsea system will provide extensive social services for children as well as a rigorous education . While B.U. teaching interns would receive course credits for their stints at the blackboard , degree candidates in nursing and dentistry would oversee medical and nutrition programs for preschoolers . B.U. social workers would visit the homes of troubled students to help address problems affecting their school performance . Other plans include a top-to-bottom overhaul of the curriculum and increases in teacher salaries , now among the lowest in the state . <P> The prospective payoff : reading , writing and math test scores would rise 20% in five years , according to B.U. projections , bringing them in line with state averages . " Even if B.U. only accomplishes 50% of what it sets out to do , " says Robinson , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme has sparked bitterness among Chelsea teachers and the school committee , who say it gives B.U. too much power . B.U. 's blunt-spoken president , John Silber , admits that the program " is not going to be run like a Quaker meeting . " B.U. originally proposed that a university-appointed board would make most school decisions . Outraged school committee members successfully lobbied for the right to to overrule verdicts on the budget or school policy with a two-thirds vote . However , B.U. would still hold most of the cards . <P> Financially , the going has already been rough . Though B.U. had optimistically hoped for $2.5 million in corporate and foundation support for the Chelsea plan , only two donors have come through so far . But the lack of funds does not seem to worry the university . Education dean Peter Greer , who will run the experiment when it goes into effect , believes the solution to Chelsea 's problems ultimately depends as much on B.U. 's imagination as on money . Says he : " If we ca n't bring improvement to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
