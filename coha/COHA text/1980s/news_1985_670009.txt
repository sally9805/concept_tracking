LOS ANGELES  --  Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Co. has become the first large insurer to acknowledge that it requires applicants for life insurance from " high-risk " geographic areas to take the AIDS antibody test . Two other insurance companies have said they plan to use the blood test but don ' t know when . The test can show whether a person is exposed to a virus linked to acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co . , Milwaukee , and Lincoln National Corp . , Fort Wayne , Ind. , said no decision has been made as to which applicants will be required to take the tests . " We added these tests because of the obvious concern for AIDS , " said David E. Gooding , senior vice president of Transamerica Occidental , a unit of San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp . Mr. Gooding said Transamerica Occidental has paid $2. 5 million in AIDS death claims so far this year . " That ' s not an enormous sum in comparison with our total business , but $2. 5 million is a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Transamerica Occidental said it has $135 billion of life insurance policies outstanding . The insurer said that any applicant who lives in an area designated as high risk by the Center for Disease Control applying for at least $100 , 000 in coverage is required to take the antibody test . That is in addition to other routinely required blood tests for hepatitis , diabetes and other serious diseases . The designated areas are Florida , Illinois , Texas , New York , California , New Jersey and Washington , D.C. , Mr. Gooding said . Mr. Gooding stressed that the AIDS test is part of a package that is evaluated with other medical tests and information . If the antibody test , called Elisa , proves positive , then it is given again . If the Elisa test again proves positive , then two other tests are administered : a T-lymphocyte cell test and the Western Blot test . Only if each one proves positive will an applicant be denied coverage . " We will decline to sell you a large amount of insurance the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Gooding said . The Elisa and Western Blot tests are antibody tests that determine whether a patient has been exposed to the HTLV-III virus , which can indicate exposure to AIDS , said Dr. Martin Finn , medical director of Public Health for Los Angeles county . These tests indicate that an individual has been infected with the virus , but they don ' t mean the person will develop AIDS , Dr. Finn said . The chance of someone exposed to the virus of developing AIDS is thought to be about 10% to 15% , Dr. Finn said . In California , where insurers are prohibited from obtaining results of blood tests indicating exposure to the AIDS virus , Transamerica will require the T-lymphocyte cell test , which measures the status of the immune system and doesn ' t indicate exposure or the presence of AIDS . But if that test proves positive , insurance will be denied if further tests indicate an applicant may have AIDS . In Washington , a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance , a trade group , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin administering the AIDS antibody test . Other major life insurers have said they currently don ' t plan to require an AIDS antibody test or ask application questions about AIDS . Those companies include Prudential Insurance Co. of America , Newark , N.J. ; Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , both of New York ; Aetna Life &; Casualty Co. and Travelers Corp. , both of Hartford , Conn. ; and Cigna Corp . , Philadelphia .
