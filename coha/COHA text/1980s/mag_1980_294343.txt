BEING THERE Directed by Hal Ashby Screenplay by Jerzy Kosinski <P> Being There is a spectacular balancing act . For almost two hours , Writer Jerzy Kosinski , Director Hal Ashby and Star Peter Sellers keep a single , scorchingly witty joke floating miraculously through midair . Though the joke ultimately crashes to earth too early-about 15 minutes before the movie ends-the final letdown does not spoil what has gone before . Here is a comedy that valiantly defies both gravity and the latest Hollywood fashion . There is n't a single laugh in Being There that owes anything to Animal House . <P> The film is an adaptation of Kosinski 's 1971 novel . Its hero is Chance , a gardener , an illiterate and a 30-year shut-in whose entire knowledge of life comes from watching television . What might happen , Kosinski wonders , if such a man were suddenly forced to leave home and become a citizen of the real world ? The answer to that question is Being There 's single joke : no sooner does Chance venture out than he is mistaken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate . The secret of his success is TV . Having been nurtured by the medium , Chance has all the attributes of a perfect TV star ; he is bland , nonthreatening and always cheery . It is Kosinski 's conceit that even a simpleton , if telegenic , has what it takes to be king in the land of the tube . <P> This point is brought home in a series of scenes built around the timeless farcical device of mistaken identity . For the gag to work repeatedly , the audience must believe that Chance is so completely blank that he could indeed seem to be all things to all the people he meets . Peter Sellers ' meticulously controlled performance brings off this seemingly impossible task ; as he proved in Lolita , he is a master at adapting the surreal characters of modern fiction to the naturalistic demands of movies . His Chance is sexless , affectless and guileless to a fault . His face shows no emotion except the beatific , innocent smile of a moron . His verbal repertoire consists only of mild pleasantries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' gestures are so specific and consistent that Chance never becomes clownish or arch . He is convincing enough to make the film 's fantastic premise credible ; yet he manages to get every laugh .
