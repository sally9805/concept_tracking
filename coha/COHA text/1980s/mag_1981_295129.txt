The first right on earth is the right of the ego . <P> - Ayn Rand <P> With her usual authoritarian sweep , Author Ayn Rand strikes a basic blow for her consistent dogma of individualism . Though she is more a cult figure than a popular philosopher , her words mirror an attitude that is becoming more and more common in the U.S. , particularly among public figures . Indeed , an increasing number of Americans seem to have concluded that the right to ego implies the duty to exercise it publicly . The result is something of a rout for the time-honored American taboo against tooting one 's own horn . Today it is commonplace for Americans to come right out and admit just how wonderful they really are . <P> Listen to the new surge of self-applause .

" <P> Bleats of unchecked egoism are now so commonplace that self-glorification may be well on the way to becoming standard American style . Yet such an epidemic of flagrant braggadocio would have scandalized the country not long ago . Most Americans have always felt , as many still feel , dutybound to sniff at the ostentatious chest thumper and look down on all public boasting . Brazen self-admiration has never been considered criminal , nor necessarily degenerate , but it has always been judged tacky - poor form , at best . Good form has always required reticence about one 's virtues . To think well of oneself was one thing , but , under the traditional rules , it was quite an other to give voice to one 's privately cultivated selfesteem .
