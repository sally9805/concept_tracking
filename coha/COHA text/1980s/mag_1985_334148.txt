DIED . Iosif Shklovskii , 68 , maverick Soviet astrophysicist and radio astronomer who made basic discoveries about neutron stars , quasars and novas ( exploding stars ) , and also led the Soviets ' search for extraterrestrial intelligence ; of undisclosed causes ; in Moscow . In the mid-1960s he posited that some intense radio emissions came from advanced alien civilizations , but they proved to be from quasars . Shklovskii 's 1966 collaborative book with U.S. Astronomer Carl Sagan , Intelligent Life in the Universe , is still considered the basic treatise on the prospects for life beyond earth .
