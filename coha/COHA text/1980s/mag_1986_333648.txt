The year was 1940 , and the political master Franklin D. Roosevelt was speaking at a Jackson Day dinner about the glories of his beloved Democratic Party . " But the future lies with those wise political leaders , " admonished F.D.R. , " who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics . " <P> That warning echoed in the aftermath of last week 's election as triumphant Democrats let their hopes rise for a resurgence in national leadership . As if Roosevelt 's ghost had sponsored him , Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. , a biographer of F.D.R. , showed up in Washington to extol his new book , The Cycles of American History , and offer his own resonant warnings that the " worship of party " could swallow up the purposes . " One wishes that the intellectual energy expended in recent years on procedural reform had been devoted instead to the substance of our problems , " wrote Schlesinger . " Nor are substantive problems going to be solved by large committees with two representatives from every state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . numerical majorities are no substitute for leadership . " <P> There it was again : the call , not for endless fiddling with the process and imagery , but for men and women who can harness the Democrats and unite them as an instrument of positive vision . In short , the Democrats , with their majorities in Congress and the statehouses , must put up or shut up if they intend to capture the future . Hammering at the failures of Ronald Reagan will not be enough . <P> The first responses of the victors left something to be desired . Missouri 's Richard Gephardt , a self-promoted presidential possibility , when asked about increasing taxes to deal with the huge deficits , avoided an answer . Hopeful Gary Hart , writing in the New York Times , put forth a vague pastiche for " renewal " and " healing " that hinted at a retreat toward trade protectionism and vast new Government spending programs . He offered no clues on where the money might come from in a nation whose wealth is dangerously overspent now . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did nothing so much as remind people of the Senate Democratic leader 's other , unhappy years in the job . <P> Somebody with wit , courage and a love of adventure needs to take over the Democratic Party . A handful of daring and like-minded competitors  --  Symington , Johnson , Humphrey , Kennedy  --  did that back in 1960 , and then J.F.K. grabbed it all and took the world along . Reagan did it with the Republicans while the technicians with their polls and committees sputtered and protested his right-wing doctrine . But at least he had a doctrine . <P> A century ago , Woodrow Wilson worried : " America is now sauntering through her resources and through the mazes of her politics with easy nonchalance ; but presently there will come a time when she will be surprised to find herself grown old  --  a country crowded , strained , perplexed  --  when she will be obliged . . . to pull herself together , adopt a new regimen of life , husband her resources , concentrate her strength , steady her methods , sober her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not her average , members .
