 | Her age is fortysomething , her occupation , world-renowned TV reporter . Her fondest coup was relieving Marlon Brando of the deed to his island during an allnight poker game ( she promptly exchanged it for his promise of an exclusive interview ) . She 's also a killer at darts and in-your-face zingers , which she unabashedly attributes to " bad PMS .

But , really now , is that any excuse for accusing him of " still wearing a retainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive home ? with smarts , nerve and the subtlety of a charging rhino in three-inch spikes ? the presence of a revolutionary new force in prime-time television . Its name is womanpower . It is stamping an imprint on both sides of the camera , reshaping the male and female images on the screen as well as the sexual makeup of the industry that manufactures those images . No two ways about it : TV women have come a long , long way since Mrs. Cleaver whipped up her last breakfast for the Beay . After decades of network mistreatment , they 're rallying to the war cry of the inimitable Roseanne : " I am woman . Hear me ROAR ! " Before anyone nominates the networks for a NOW certificate of appreciation , let 's make one thing clear . The feminization of television has surprisingly little to do with feminism . At its roots lies an intriguing demographic shift : female viewers have seized control of the prime-time dial as the networks ' male audience increasingly drifts to the cable channels ( where else could they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? ) . At the same time , market research reveals that women have become the principal purchasers of the products most advertised by prime-time sponsors ( e.g. , cosmetics and household goods ) . Such findings have spawned a theory : the network that most endears itself to the lady of the house has the best chance of survival . The theory also comes with a corollary : shows that capture the viewers sponsors prize most ? women between the ages of 18 and 49 ? can charge " Cosby " - close ad rates even though they rest a tier below in the ratings . A second explanation for TV 's sexual role reversal can be found behind the cameras . As @#  | the networks ardently woo women , the men who have traditionally controlled what the tube disgorges at night ? mostly male characters playing out male fantasies ? are being joined by a talented and ambitious cadre of females . You might say that they 've formed a sort of Sisterhood of the Tube . A dozen or so of the women now writing , producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 's triumphs and share recollections of their near-identical struggles . They call themselves the " Class of ' 72 , " referring to the year the Equal Employment Opportunity Act extended civilrights protections to private industry . That 's when they started marching into the networks and studios , eventually winning key positions . The visible impact of these converging forces ? women dominating the networks ' audience and integrating their creative ranks ? can be observed all over the primetime airwaves . Let 's begin with the unprecedented number of series featuring virtually all-female casts . There 's " China Beach " ( women in war ) , " HeartBeat " ( women in medicine ) , " Nightingales " ( women in nursing school ) , " A Different World " ( women in college ) , " Studio 5B " ( women in television ) , " Designing Women " ( women in business ) and " The Golden Girls " ( women in retirement ) . Now add such female-centered shows as " A Fine Romance , " " Day by Day , " " 227 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate &; Allie , " " Dynasty , " " Falcon Crest " and " Who 's the Boss ? " Nor are we merely counting heads . Distaff characters , traditionally confined to serving as dutiful appendages to male authority figures , are now driving the action as well as crowding into the picture . And that 's because they 're being cast in the formidable image of their behind-camera female creators . " Nice and sweet are out , " declares " Murphy Brown " executive producer Diane English , 40 . " TV 's new women are n't trying to please other people . Saying what 's on your mind is in . Not being afraid of what people think of you is in . You have to have edges to work today . " Love Pest : Few shows are working better than Candice Bergen 's chic-collar " Murphy Brown " and Roseanne Barr 's sweatycollar " Roseanne , " this season 's hottest new sitcoms .

" The critics adore her ; they have n't lavished so much affection on an unmarried woman since Mary Richards walked into that other TV newsroom in Minneapolis . Her fan club blankets the socioeconomic spectrum . When Bergen strolls a Manhattan street , taxi drivers hoist their thumbs out their windows and bellow , " Hey , Murph ! " So many female newscasters are copying her unstructured jackets , oversize jewelry and thigh-high skirts that , when W magazine conceived a fashion spread on women anchors , it chose Jane Pauley , Kathleen Sullivan and ... Murphy Brown . The morning after an episode in which Murphy 's ticket to the presidential Inaugural got lost , the Bush transition team rushed Bergen a special invitation .

What are the women who inhabit today 's network series telling us about the post-Reagan , postfeminist ' 90s ? Do n't expect unanimity ; every video movement invariably harbors a few course-defying exceptions . Nonetheless , this one seems to be sending some unmistakable messages : It 's OK to work : Here 's an intriguing statistic . According to one recent study , 75 percent of TV 's female characters in 1987 worked outside the home , a figure nearly 20 points higher than the percentage in real life . Obviously , the infusion of women into the industry 's executive suites has been doing wonders for their on-camera employment rate . Even more remarkable , TV 's new working women hold real jobs rather than ornamental titles . Sue Ellen Ewing of " Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keaton of " Family Ties " is billed as an architect , but for all we see of their workaday lives , they might as well be full-time homemakers . Not so with the female doctors on " HeartBeat , " who run their own medical clinic with an answer-to-no-man authority . Murphy Brown 's emotional attachment to her job is so intense that , when she 's suspended for insubordination , she completely unravels . After hitting bottom ( " Last night I made pudding . " she wails ) , Murphy gets back on the air after an agonized confession to her boss : " You 've got to understand something about me . My work is just about the most important thing in my life . " Imagine Rhoda Morgenstern even fantasizing such a thought . It 's OK to be alone : A record proportion of TV 's female population lives without husbands or children .

" she exclaims ) . It 's just that they 've grown rather fond of their independence . Says Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , who has written nearly every episode of " Designing Women " since its premiere three years ago : " When Mary Richards threw that hat in the air for the last time , it stayed up . The contemporary TV woman is making it on her own . " It 's OK to mess up : By now even casual prime-time visitors have absorbed the message : Superwoman does n't live there anymore .

Her living room looks like it was recently occupied by an army of very small boys . Does she care ? Fat chance . Beneath their self-assured veneers , these women carry stretch marks on their @# @#  | psyches . They 've been roughed up by life and are coming to terms with their limits . They are flawed survivors . Consider K.C. , the resident junkie-hooker on " China Beach " and perhaps the unlikeliest heroine in weekly-series annals . When Da Nang 's new commandant kicks her off base , the ever-resilient K.C. opens a beauty salon . " She wants to leave prostitution and become a successful businesswoman , " explains John Sacret Young , the show 's cocreator . " With war comes capitalism . We saw K.C. as the first Yuppie . " It 's OK to mouth off : " Do you eat with that mouth ? " inquires Murphy Brown 's house painter . He 's just trying to even the score . As with most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uzi ; especially on any male within range . Though sexual combat is hardly new to TV , it 's never been waged from the female quarter with such deadly precision . To further stack the odds , today 's video men ? at least on the women-powered shows ? start from a position of weakness . They tend to be cast either as professional housekeepers ( Tony on " Who 's the Boss ? " ) , klutzy Lotharios ( Dwayne on " A Different World " ) or lazy , ineffectual breadwinners ( Dan , Roseanne 's chronically unemployed mate , who , as she gently reminds him , " do n't do nothin ' !

In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the video pendulum has swung too far from the blissfully domestic supermoms who once warmed the electronic hearth . One such dissident is Barbara Billingsley , the actress who wore June Cleaver 's perfectly starched apron for six years . " Roseanne sure puts down her husband , " complains Billingsley . " She sure says terrible things to her kids . I would n't want to be treated that way . I would n't want to treat kids that way . " A Los Angeles secretary who recently attended a taping of " Murphy Brown " came away equally dismayed : " Murphy has no compassion or mercy . She seems so hardhearted . " Oh , well , no one ever extolled television for its abhorrence of excess . And yet only the most pig-skinned reactionary would mourn the days when Lucy had to beg Ricky for a measly $5 , or when Harriet Nelson would implore Ozzie : " How can I get a permanent if you wo n't tell me whether you want me to or not ? " The liberation of the TV woman has lagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyler Moore 's single working girl ? acclaimed as a breakthrough in her day ? seems , in retrospect , inordinately timorous . ( How many times did she cry on Lou Grant 's shoulder ? ) Besides , Mary was soon swept away by the " jiggle " wave . Feminists may have been igniting their bras , but the only heat generated by the video bimbos of the late ' 70s was strictly hormonal . ( How many ways did Suzanne Somers find to loosen her towel ? ) The early ' 80s brought a few reforms . " Hill Street Blues " and " Cagney &; Lacey " suggested that a woman 's place could be any place , but these were token exceptions . On the prime-time soaps , women remained typecast as mothers and lovers . " They were too rich to cook and clean , so they lunched and shopped , " notes Sally Streenland , an official of Wider Opportunities for Women . " The only women not afraid of ambition and power were portrayed as evil ? Alexis on Dynasty , ' Angela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Cosby Show , " " Family Ties " and their clones , sitcoms slipped into domestic fantasy . Wives juggled their careers and family lives with miraculous unflappability . They invariably arrived home in time to make dinner and listen to the children 's problems . Their houses were as pristine as Shirley Par-  | tridge 's , yet we never saw them attack a molecule of dust . Grumbles Streenland : " In the real world , women work to keep out of poverty and to send their kids to college . They are fatigued and short-tempered . These women never lost their tempers . It 's an impossible ideal . " Enter , with a megaton blast , Roseanne . This Cheetos-popping , blue-collar curmudgeon is being hailed as the medium 's first authentic working mother . That means she struggles . When Roseanne must take time off from her job at a plastics factory to visit her daughter 's teacher , she gets docked an hour 's pay . She needs that money , yet her real foe is time . At breakfast she tosses cereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why waste a few seconds washing a dish ? Her unruly kids drive her to wit 's end ( " Now I know why some animals eat their young , " she cracks ) and her hubby 's idea of pitching in is to take out the garbage every three years . Yet we know she loves them ; her bark is simply her way of coping with overload . " I wanted to be the first mom ever to be a mom on TV , " says 36-year-old Roseanne Barr . " I wanted to send a message about how much we mothers really do . " Nixing Nixon : The message of " Murphy Brown " is , in its opposite fashion , no less revolutionary . Here 's a woman so unsuited for motherhood that , confronted with caring for three abandoned children , she tells them bedtime stories about Haldeman and Ehrlichman . When they cry , she tries to bribe them with a stack of 10s and 20s . When they act up in a restaurant , she snarls : " Stop throwing food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , Murphy commands awesome respect . She dines with Cronkite , jousts with Kissinger and annually turns down Richard Nixon 's pitch for a date . " The man is a groundhog , " she snorts , slamming down the phone . " Every February he 's back . " ( Come to think of it , compulsive name-dropping may be this show 's only sin . On one episode we counted no fewer than 16 references to real TV people , reaching all the way back to Bert Parks ) . Bergen is clearly having the time of her life ( page 55 ) . " I get to play this commando ! " she exclaims . " I love people who pitch themselves headlong into things . " That she does , patrician jaw outthrust and knees pumping , an incandescent charge of comedic nitro who , at her most manic , recalls Carol Burnett impersonating Katharine Hepburn . Nor does her regal beauty get in the way . Observes Barbara Corday , the No. 2 programmer at CBS : " Candice Bergen has proven that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Executive producer English also deserves lots of credit . She 's given " Murphy Brown " whipsmart writers and a custom-fit ensemble of supporting characters . Our favorite is reporter Corky Sherwood ( Faith Ford ) , an exMiss America whose ditsy chirpiness conceals a viper 's bite . Watching Murphy strike out as a surrogate mother , Corky sympathetically coos : " This must be partic- ularly hard for you . . . knowing there 's no one special in your life and you 're probably not ovulating anymore . " Only a woman could invent that line , and only the sexual integration of TV 's creative community could have blessed us with a " Murphy Brown . " That 's not to imply that the " Class of ' 72 " had an easy time of it . Most of them eventually bumped against the " glass ceiling , " the invisible barrier that still keeps women from the networks ' executive heights . No one rose faster and bumped harder than Esther Shapiro . During a threeyear stay at ABC in the mid ' 70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped develop such ratings winners as " Masada , " " Friendly Fire " and " The Women 's Room . " Despite all that , ABC balked at offering her a promotion . " I knew I could never be president , so I left , " she explains . Today Shapiro , who cocreated " Dynasty " in 1980 , runs an independent production company so powerful that network heads visit her at her offices . Other members of the Sisterhood also strode off on their own ? or at least are contemplating such a move . Before creating " Murphy Brown , " Diane English produced two network sitcoms . On " Foley Square , " CBS assigned a pair of male executive producers above her  | and , in the case of " My Sister Sam , " it exiled the show to a hopeless Saturday-night slot . Times change . These days English receives regular calls from CBS network president Howard Stringer and is being courted by virtually every studio in town . Her ambitions , however , have expanded with her reputation . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows . " I want the profits and the control . " Power grab : Roseanne Barr threw every ounce of her formidable weight into muscling control of " Roseanne . " From Day One , she clashed with executive producer Matt Williams , who , in Barr 's view , was stereotyping her character as " a sarcastic bitch . " Finally , after ABC 's hottest star confronted the network with a him-or-me ultimatum , Williams departed and Barr won complete say over all aspects of her role . She really is the biggest woman on television . Down in the video trenches , however , females still grapple with stubbornly resistant forms of sexism . At last count , male TV writers earned an average of $43,000 a year , nearly a third more than their female colleagues . Yet other statistics suggest that women perform better than men . While women make up only 8 percent of the industry 's director corps , they recently garnered 24 percent of the nominations for Directors Guild awards . " HeartBeat " creator Sara Davidson , an acclaimed novelist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power behind the cameras distorts TV 's portrayals of her gender . " You still get men 's fantasies of the way women talk and relate , " she complains . " The only place I see women playing poker or talking in sports analogies is on television . It just is n't realistic . " Vet flak : Women on the tube 's receiving end are taking note ? and registering their anger with unprecedented fervor . A band of California nurses recently launched a nationwide protest campaign against NBC 's leeringly retro " Nightingales , " a kind of " Charlie 's Angels " with bedpans . ABC 's " China Beach , " meanwhile , caught flak from female Vietnam vets for its allegedly demeaning stereotypes . " Most of the women on this show are preoccupied with men rather than with their jobs , " fumes Cherie Rankin , a Massachusetts psychotherapist who served in Vietnam as a Red Cross worker . " They are bimbos or hookers , always dressed in seductive clothes . They 're a GI 's fantasy . By God , they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It hardly seems coincidental that both " Nightingales " and " China Beach " were created by men . When women call the shots , such stereotypes invariably topple . And judging from the network pilot shows for next season , the toppling may be just beginning . Under consideration are series about strong , aggressive women pursuing careers as newspaper reporters , magazine writers , corporate vice presidents , construction workers , boondock bistro owners and big-city lawyers . Lots o : lawyers . Terry Louise Fisher . who cocreated " L.A. Law , " is gearing up a show about a female district attorney who'l. challenge one of prime time 's last sexist shibboleths . " A single woman can be tough anc powerful on TV , but invariably men do n't like her and don ' : ask her out , " says Fisher . " I 'm going to give this character a decent social life . She 's going to have dates . She 's going to have fun . " Suppose , for the sake of debate , that none of this comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly achieved ? Look at it cynically . an attitude not entirely alien to video critics , and you might conclude that they 've won only the most dubious of victories : the right to set their own standards ' t ? T ( of ineptitude , cowardice and everything shabby that most of television represents . But look at it literally , actually watch them in action , and you ca n't help detecting some glints of hope for us all . Let 's contrast three on-screen moments that , in their different ways , directly address the subject of women 's liberation . Here , from " HeartBeat , " is an exchange between a stressed-out female doctor and a female nurse . Doctor .. " Do you think our mothers had it this hard ? " Nurse : " A different kind of hard . We 've come a long way , baby . " Whew . C'm on , lighten up ! Now here 's Suzanne Sugarbaker , the irrepressible former beauty queen on " Designing Women , " with her own distinctive take : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse not to kill bugs for you . I do n't care what anyone says . I think the man should have to kill the bugs ! " Better . But a shade too light . Lastly , here 's Murphy Brown daring , if only for an instant , to plunge into that virtually unexplored video zone between comedy and poignancy . After setting out to integrate a men-only club for Washington journalists , after lying down in front of Morley Safer 's car , after resorting to blatant extortion to get her foot in the door and after finally finding herself ostracized by the entire membership , Murphy wearily confides to a friend : " Sometimes I wonder about a person who gets into her 40s and she 's still pushing her way into everything . I wonder whether everything is worth the fight . " Do n't worry . Like the quarterback who 's her idol , Murphy 's just catching her wind before bouncing back up . After all , this woman belongs to a mighty tough club . 54 NEWSWEEK : MARCH 13 , 1989  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
