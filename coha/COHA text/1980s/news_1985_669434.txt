Few immigrants to the United States have ever been as strange to their new world as the largely illiterate Hmong. // That dogs are part of the Hmong cuisine is a widespread myth . Hmong , however , have purchased dogs and hung them from trees to frighten evil spirits during New Year celebrations - to the horror of their Fresno neighbors. // // In the last two years , Fresno has become the US capital of the Hmong - tribal refugees who fought the Viet Cong under American direction and lost . Some 12 , 000 Hmong now live in the city , more than 20 , 000 in Fresno County. // At least 90 percent are supported by welfare . They have helped to push Fresno County ' s already-high 20 percent poverty rate to 25 percent . And they are forcing some sharp questions here about how the welfare system itself is trapping them in a pit of dependency. // The Hmong first began settling in Fresno because the climate was mild and farming was the only occupation that seemed even remotely familiar . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no education of any kind. // As a rule , they have failed at agriculture , innocents in a sophisticated American business . But they have continued to settle in Fresno and other California farm cities , such as Stockton and Merced. // Xong Toua Hang , a small , wiry , earnest man eager to use the little English he has learned , deeply regrets his welfare dependency. // He came here from Ohio two years ago and went through farm training with a Hmong cooperative , but he found he had little hope of actually supporting his family of seven , even well below the poverty level , by leasing land and working it with available equipment. // And even by making the attempt , he would become officially self-employed , so the family would lose its Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits. // Mr. Hang has applied for jobs when he has learned of them . But he has been turned away , lacking even the rudimentary skills needed to compete for unskilled work. // More important , if he succeeds in working 100 hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . This 100-hour rule - according to welfare officials , welfare rights advocates , and Hmong themselves - is a major obstacle to easing into the work force. // At the wage rates Hang is most likely to earn , 100 hours would bring in less than $400 a month . Yet to make up the value of his welfare subsidies through working wages , estimates Tony Souza , director of Fresno ' s Economic Opportunity Commission , Hang would have to earn around $1 , 600 - a virtually impossible leap. // So , like many Hmong men , he goes to English classes a few hours a day and sits at home. // ' ' This way that I see today , we will be on welfare forever , ' ' says Shur V. Vangyi , a premier Hmong leader living in Santa Ana , California. // The 100-hour rule makes it expensive to work , he says . ' ' They should give incentives to refugees to work , instead of not to work. ' ' // The secretary of the US Department of Health and Human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1970s , and it applies to welfare recipients all over the country . But it has become a special issue here in Fresno , where thousands of indigent refugees are concentrated. // California is in the process of exempting refugees from the rule , but this exemption will apply only to refugees in the US less than three years . In Fresno County , that group includes only 65 people. // Welfare officials are lobbying the HHS in Washington to start a pilot project here that would make the entire county exempt from the 100-hour rule. // Under the Fresno plan , the same people would be eligible to apply for welfare as now , but as their wages and working hours increased , their welfare checks would shrink on a sliding scale , rather than stopping altogether. // ' ' This is one instance when trying to get people into the work force will save the taxpayers money , and it ' s pro-family , ' ' says Ben Kelley , director of Fresno County ' s Department of Social Services. // Mr. Kelley is especially disturbed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , sometimes forcing men to leave their families if they want to work. // ' ' If the mother marries us - the welfare department - then we will meet her economic needs in a marginal way. ' ' // The Hmong have not given up yet on agriculture . But most attempts have been early failures . If sugar beet prices were high , the Hmong all planted sugar beets and swamped their markets . If cucumber prices rose , then the next year they all grew cucumbers. // One group that is succeeding is Asian Pacific Producers , a Hmong cooperative that leases land and equipment and uses government funds to get advice and training. // This group met its goals for its first year and is working to become independent of government grants. // ' ' This is a testing ground for the Lao people , ' ' says Tom Nguyen , director of Refugee Services , a part of Catholic Charities in Fresno . ' ' They learn how hard they have to work , how hard it is to market products , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Basically , they ' re a very bright , productive people , ' ' says Fresno City Councilman Chris Petersen , who has 6 , 000 Hmong in his urban district . The US has a special obligation to the Hmong , he says , after recruiting them for the war in Southeast Asia. // The Hmong are often caught by surprise by the niceties of American culture . Those Hmong who hung dogs at New Year , for example , thought they were following all the rules by buying the animals at the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. // But for the young Hmong , the new ways come easier . Xong Toua Hang ' s 18-year-old son is a freshman at Fresno City College , hoping to jump to a university in order to study medicine . But young Hang Pau insists he will stay with the traditional , close-knit Hmong community . ' ' I look at what I see out there , ' ' he says , ' ' and it ' s not good. ' ' // Mr. Hang , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lost life in Laos . ' ' In Laos , I never owed anybody anything , ' ' he says through his son. // ' ' Now , for most of my life I have to depend . ' ' His remaining happiness is that his children will learn to succeed in this alien new world . ' ' If I talk to you too long , ' ' he says in English , ' ' I will cry. ' ' // //
