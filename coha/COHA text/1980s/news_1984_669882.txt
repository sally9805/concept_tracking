LOS ANGELES  --  Bergen Brunswig Corp. , which last week agreed to acquire National Intergroup Inc. , is well positioned for continued growth as a distributor . Besides distributing pharmaceutical products to drugstores and hospitals , Bergen Brunswig recently began selling videocassettes . Its success in that area shows that its high-technology distribution methods can be applied to new products . " Bergen is the role model for the industry , and that has been true for some time , " says James Waggoner , an analyst with Bear , Stearns &; Co . National Intergroup , formerly National Steel Corp. , has non-steel operations including financial services and aluminum . Under the merger agreement , a new holding company , Bergen National Corp. , will oversee the two companies ' operations , with combined annual sales of about $3 billion . National is being acquired for stock valued at $580 million . Bergen Brunswig ' s chairman , Emil Martini Jr. , and its president , Robert Martini , his brother , will have majority control of the new concern through ownership of 97. 2% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new concern ' s 21 directors . Most of the combined concern ' s $400 million in cash will be invested in distribution businesses . Bergen Brunwig ' s success in distribution so far has resulted largely from its adept use of technology . Bergen Drug Co. was a small , family-owned wholesaler when Emil Martini took control in 1956 . Almost from the beginning , he pushed the company to use computers for inventory management and to develop charge statements for retail customers . In 1973 , Bergen Brunswig developed a hand-held data entry terminal to read universal bar codes . The device became the basis for a computerized ordering system that eliminated the need for order takers and cut phone bills . The company has since pioneered a variety of automated distribution systems , which have cut the cost of drugs to retailers . Computer links with manufacturers allow Bergen Brunswig to transmit orders automatically , rather than by mail . The system has reduced errors in ordering drugs with complicated names . It also has shortened delivery time , freeing retailers from having to borrow money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from manufacturers in the 1960s , but today more than 60% are ordered from wholesalers . That percentage is expected to continue to rise . Automation in distribution , traditionally a labor-intensive business , also has let Bergen cut costs and post healthy profits . Its computer system has , for instance , increased productivity at the warehouse by sequencing order picking . Weak results at its hospital supply business , which accounts for about 8% of its revenue , have hurt earnings growth in recent quarters . Fourth-quarter operating earnings dropped slightly after previous year-to-year earnings growth from operations of 20% to 30% . But Bergen Brunswig ' s earnings from continuing operations rose 11% to $23. 4 million , or $1. 86 a share , for the year ended Aug. 31 , on a 21% rise in revenue to $1. 7 billion . About 80% of Bergen Brunswig ' s revenue comes from drug distribution . Pharmaceuticals are expensive and don ' t take up much room in a warehouse , making them an ideal distribution product . The company distributes to about 7 , 000 drug outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ' s largest drug and toiletry distributor . While McKesson serves a wider variety of retailers , Bergen Brunswig has focused on drug retail chains that don ' t have centralized buying operations and tend to buy through a wholesaler . In 1982 , Bergen Brunswig acquired Commtron , a national distributor of electronic products and videocasettes with annual sales of about $60 million . For the fiscal year ended Aug. 31 , sales from those operations grew to $210 million , making Bergen Brunswig the largest distributor of prerecorded videocasettes . Those sales now account for 12% of Bergen ' s total revenue . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
