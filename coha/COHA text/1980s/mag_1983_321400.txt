Coke 's aspartame generation <P> Sweet-toothed but calorie-conscious Americans constitute a mammoth market for soft drinks , but there have been problems among the profits . Cyclamates and saccharin , artificial sweeteners used in soft drinks during the past generation , were thought to cause cancer , at least in laboratory animals . Cyclamates were generally banned in 1970 , but Congress saved saccharin by requiring a warning label on drinks that contain it . <P> Now comes aspartame , which has been tested to a fare-thee-well by the Food and Drug Administration . Last week Atlanta 's Coca-Cola introduced a new version of its diet Coke , containing a blend of saccharin and NutraSweet , drugmaker G.D . Searle 's trade name for the aspartame . The new Coke is already on sale in Birmingham and will appear in Chicago , New York City , Washington and all other major American markets by year 's end . <P> Diet Coke , which so far has been sweetened entirely with saccharin , made its debut a year ago and has since become the fourth-bestselling soft drink in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Brian G. Dyson , president of Coca-Cola USA , said the new diet Coke will deliver better flavor and attract male consumers , who are " less likely to make taste sacrifices for dieting . " <P> Coca-Cola 's announcement put it ahead of archrival Pepsi-Cola , which is not happy over Coke 's head start . Said one official curtly : " Pepsi will announce its plans in the near future . " Coke 's move marks the first time in 30 years that a major producer has led the market with a new drink . Innovations usually have come from smaller bottlers . By moving first , Coke will act as a giant magnet to draw others to aspartame faster . <P> And sure enough , Coke 's announcement barely made , Royal Crown Cola , also of Atlanta , tried to do Coke one lesser . It said that its Diet Rite Cola , the first diet soft drink ever ( 1962 ) , will also be sweetened with aspartame and will contain no caffeine or , another first , sodium . <P> Aspartame , 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey since being accidentally discovered in 1965 by a Searle scientist researching an ulcer drug . Aspartame-sweetened Diet Rite and diet Coke have already been sold in Canada , and diet Coke has also quenched thirsts in Ireland and Scandinavia , but the U.S. introduction had been held up by the FDA , which was wary after its approval years earlier of cyclamates and saccharin . Aspartame won FDA acceptance in 1974 , only to be pulled back after some scientists voiced concern that the substance might cause brain damage . <P> After two years of research , a panel concluded that the studies were sound . Other reviews were conducted by a board of inquiry made up of three scientists from outside the FDA . In 1981 approval was granted for aspartame 's use in such items as General Foods ' Kool-Aid and Searle 's table-sugar substitute , Equal .

It is 20 times as expensive as saccharin .
