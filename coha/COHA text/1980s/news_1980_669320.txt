It is one founded on the federal government ' s support for the role of local , competitive ports in the nation ' s economy and defense . The federal government , as partner , develops and maintains needed navigational channels . Local and state authorities , as partners , build and operate the ports. // The partnership has been fruitful for both sides : Local communities enjoy the economic benefits of port operations ; the nation benefits by having a network of thriving , sophisticated ports. // The record testifies to the size of the response b local port operators to the nation ' s needs for seaport facilities . A 1979 US Maritime Administration study , entitled US Port Development-Expenditure Survey , showed that local ports invested almost $5 billion in nonfederal money in new and expanded facilities from 1946 to 1978 . The National Transportation Policy Study Commission last year projected as a " medium growth " scenario , that local US port and harbor facility investments will total some $9. 4 billion during the period 1975-2000 . The Maritime Administration study showed some $3. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board for the period 1980-1983. // But , Today , seaport managers face a planning dilemma . The federal government has signaled its intention to change the rules for the partnership . Port officials complain that none of the federal environmental protection acts of recent years acknowledge the nation ' s needs for seaport development in the face of the world ' s changing maritime fleet . For the nation ' s port systems , gaining needed federal permits for dredging and terminal development has become a time-consuming and costly process. // And while Congress and the executive branch wrestle over ultimate control of water resources projects , there has not been a new or expanded navigational project authorized since 1976 . These delays mean inflation will make terminal development even more expensive in the future and further drain the ability of ports to finance projects. // In addition , port administrators point out that the federal government collects more than $5. 5 billion annually at US seaports in custom receipts . This is many times the amount the government spends annually on navigational channel development and maintenance. // Seaport managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy initiatives . The " cost sharing " initiative would require states to pay 5 percent of total costs for navigational channel projects . The industry argues that by developing the port facilities themselves , they already are practicing " cost sharing , " and that any further shift of fiscal responsibility to them will seriously inhibit the ability of many ports to meet future cargo demands. // These new challenges come as public port authorities are squeezing capital to finance needed terminal projects . The world ' s maritime fleet has undergone great changes in the last two decades . Much of the change has resulted from new emphasis on costly containerization facilities . These changes , as well as the nation ' s growing reliance on imported bulk raw materials , are pressing the need for ports themselves to change. // Port managers believe all seaports , large or small , represent major business enterprises producing significant economic benifits to the communities they serve , and providing essential transportation services to a variety of shipping interests. // A 1978 US Maritime Administration report concluded that operations at the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definable in terms of " any economic activity directly needed in the movement of waterbone cargo . " Gross sales amounted to $28 billion in 1978 , equating to a $15 billion contribution to the gross national product . This activity provided employment for 1 , 046 , 800 persons. // The report also indicated that one job is sustained by the movement of each 600 tons of waterborne foreign trade . It concluded that every million-dollar increase in the nation ' s exports requires an average increase of $160 , 000 in port services. // Although the US seaport industry ' s statistical profile is impressive , its greater significance is represented by the essential nature of its service to the nation ' s transporatation sysin the volume of exports and imports . It is the world ' s leading supplier of agricultural commodities and manufactured goods. // Growing volumes of raw materials are needed to sustain US industrial and agricultural production . In all , US ports annually handle more than 1 billion tons of oceanborne foreign commerce . No one is predicting anything other than a continuing rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo service , ocean carriers are expected to continue handling more than 95 percent of US foreign trade. // US ports also have a proven importance to national defense strategy . This was confirmed during and after World War I when the US straggled to ship millions of tons of supplies to Europe . The task was even more formidable during World War II when troops and supplies had to be shipped to almost every region of the world . Shortly before he retired as supreme allied commander last year , Adm . Isaac C. Kidd Jr. told Congress that a conventional warfare encounter between NATO and the Warsaw bloc would necessitate 3 , 000 to 6 , 000 monthly ship crossings to Europe to resupply NATO forces. // Yet at time when the role of seaports is taking on increased importance in national defense , import-export growth , and a new reliance on coal , port officials say the task of port development is becoming increasingly difficult because of the uncertainties over the federal government ' s role in their task . **22;299; <> **42;323; **44;367; **44;413; **44;459; **44;505; <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **76;679; **28;757; **48;787; 1977 figures ( latest year available ) in tons <> **28;837; <> **76;867; **28;945; **28;975; Total <> **28;1005; Export/ <> **28;1035; <> **76;1065; **28;1143; Port <> **28;1173; Cargo <> **28;1203; Import <> **28;1233; Domestic <> <> **76;1263; <> 1 . <> <> New York <> **26;1341; 185 , 292 , 125 <> **26;1369; 66 , 608 , 016 <> **26;1397; 118 , 684 , 109 <> <> **76;1425; <> 2 . <> <> New Orleans <> **26;1503; 162 , 991 , 985 <> **26;1531; 64 , 287 , 153 <> **26;1559; 98 , 704 , 832 <> <> **76;1587; <> 3 . <> <> Houston <> **26;1665; 104 , 291 , 267 <> **26;1693; 51 , 041 , 038 <> **26;1721; 53 , 250 , 229 <> <> **76;1749; <> 4 . <> <> Baton Rouge <> **26;1827; 70 , 008 , 229 <> **26;1855; 25 , 505 , 184 <> **26;1883; 44 , 503 , 045 <> <> **76;1911; <> 5 . <> <> Philadelphia <> **26;1989; 49 , 710 , 565 <> **26;2017; 30 , 068 , 243 <> **26;2045; 19 , 642 , 322 <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 , 918 , 843 <> **26;2179; 26 , 804 , 350 <> **26;2207; 22 , 114 , 493 <> <> **76;2235; <> 7 . <> <> Corpus Christi <> **26;2313; 46 , 871 , 695 <> **26;2341; 24 , 208 , 394 <> **26;2369; 22 , 663 , 301 <> <> **76;2397; <> 8 . <> <> Tampa <> **26;2475; 45 , 619 , 951 <> **26;2503; 21 , 057 , 228 <> **26;2531; 24 , 562 , 723 <> <> **76;2559; <> 9 . <> <> Baltimore <> **26;2637; 44 , 756 , 359 <> **26;2665; 28 , 141 , 035 <> **26;2693; 16 , 615 , 324 <> <> **76;2721; <> 10 . <> <> Norfolk <> **26;2799; 43 , 862 , 200 <> **26;2827; 32 , 507 , 496 <> **26;2855; 11 , 354 , 704 <> <> **76;2883; <> 11 . <> <> Chicago <> **26;2961; 36 , 136 , 148 <> **26;2989; 6 , 144 , 074 <> **26;3017; 29 , 992 , 074 <> <> **76;3045; <> 12 . <> <> Mobile <> **26;3123; 35 , 943 , 893 <> **26;3151; 13 , 688 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> **76;3207; <> 13 . <> <> Texas City <> **26;3285; 33 , 583 , 596 <> **26;3313; 13 , 054 , 236 <> **26;3341; 20 , 529 , 360 <> <> **76;3369; <> 14 . <> <> Duluth/Superior <> **26;3447; 33 , 419 , 210 <> **26;3475; 6 , 107 , 925 <> **26;3503; 27 , 311 , 285 <> <> **76;3531; <> 15 . <> <> Long Beach <> **26;3609; 32 , 985 , 424 <> **26;3637; 22 , 532 , 914 <> **26;3665; 10 , 452 , 510 <> <> **76;3693; <> 16 . <> <> Los Angeles <> **26;3771; 31 , 325 , 506 <> **26;3799; 16 , 826 , 959 <> **26;3827; 14 , 498 , 547 <> <> **76;3855; <> 17 . <> <> Port Arthur <> **26;3933; 30 , 753 , 732 <> **26;3961; 16 , 610 , 167 <> **26;3989; 14 , 143 , 565 <> <> **76;4017; <> 18 . <> <> Marcus Hook <> **26;4095; 29 , 780 , 434 <> **26;4123; 15 , 456 , 195 <> **26;4151; 14 , 324 , 239 <> <> **76;4179; <> Paulsboro , NJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 870 , 982 <> **26;4285; 14 , 143 , 741 <> <> **76;4313; <> 20 . <> <> Boston <> **26;4391; 25 , 975 , 275 <> **26;4419; 8 , 049 , 093 <> **26;4447; 17 , 926 , 182 <> <> **76;4475; <> 21 . <> <> Lake Charles <> **26;4553; 25 , 401 , 265 <> **26;4581; 9 , 659 , 975 <> **26;4609; 15 , 741 , 290 <> <> **76;4637; <> 22 . <> <> Detroit <> **26;4715; 25 , 092 , 847 <> **26;4743; 5 , 553 , 220 <> **26;4771; 19 , 539 , 627 <> <> **76;4799; <> 23 . <> <> Pascagoula <> **26;4877; 23 , 832 , 891 <> **26;4905; 11 , 192 , 207 <> **26;4933; 12 , 640 , 684 <> <> **76;4961; <> 24 . <> <> Richmond , CA <> **26;5039; 23 , 823 , 508 <> **26;5067; 11 , 177 , 603 <> **26;5095; 12 , 645 , 905 <> <> **76;5123; <> 25 . <> <> Toledo <> **26;5201; 23 , 275 , 707 <> **26;5229; 9 , 357 , 761 <> **26;5257; 13 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> St. Louis <> **26;5363; 22 , 478 , 309 <> **26;5391; **26;5419; 22 , 478 , 309 <> <> **76;5447; <> 27 .
