Foxboro quarterback John Manning has been on the varsity football team for four years and has accomplished a lot , but the senior doesn ' t feel thepressure to produce the big numbers every week . " I always remind myself to enjoy it and have fun , " he said . As much fun as Manning is having , his eye is still on the standings . " I would love to see us winning the Division 3 Super Bowl , " Manning said . " Personally , I don ' t want to set any statistical goals . I want to set goals in the win-loss column . I believe the Hockomock League compares to any league . It ' s one of the most competitive . " In my freshman year , I played the first game against Oliver Ames on the freshman team . I ran for three touchdowns . I went up to the varsity the next week against North Attleboro , but did not play . The next week , I started against Sharon . It was just a matter of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He passed for more than 140 yards and three touchdowns . Foxboro had a new quarterback . Manning finished his freshman year with eight scoring passes and 600 yards . His sophomore year ended with 8 touchdown passes and 800 yards . Manning ' s junior year was less productive ( only 7 scoring passes ) but better on yardage ( 1100 yards ) . In 1983 , Manning has four TD passes . Friday against Sharon , Manning passed for almost 200 yards . " In John ' s sophomore year , he was under a lot of pressure , in the eyes of a lot of people , " Foxboro coach Jack Martinelli said . " People expected him to produce the stats of his freshman year . They all forgot he was a 15-16 year- old kid then . " Manning began his career as a quarterback as many youngsters do - in Pop Warner . " When I was in third grade , I was in the junior football program . Ed O ' Malley was the coach , and still is . He first taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John is a real leader , on and off the field , " Foxboro athletic director Art Jewett said . " On the field , he ' s a leader by example , and off the field , he ' s not an introvert ; he ' s just quiet . " Manning is also starting on defense . " This year I ' m playing free safety full time . In the past , I would play nickel back in some situations , " Manning said . But Manning is known for his offense . " He can control the tempo of a football game , " Jewett said . " He ' s a dominant force . He ' s good under stress . And you ' ve got to get a piece of him to bring him down . " Manning ( 6-1 , 175 ) is also a starting guard on the basketball team , averaging 11 points . He ' s also a member of the tennis team that won the Hockomock League championship in 1982 . He has also earned letters in track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school , " said Jewett . As a quarterback , Manning is a classic . " We made him into a dropback quarterback , as opposed to a sprintout quarterback , " Martinelli said . " If the play calls for staying in the pocket , he will . He scrambles as a weapon , " said Jewett . Manning excels in the classroom , too . He is ranked 20th in his class and is a member of the National Honor Society . College ball is in Manning ' s future . " I ' ve heard from just about all of the big schools in the Northeast , " Manning said . " John is a complete kid . A first class kid , with a wealth of ability , " said Martinelli.
