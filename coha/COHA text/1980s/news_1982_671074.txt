Scratch that . Mr. Altman seems able to cope with the stage , it would now appear , only so long as he has no more than two actors to deal with in an already limited area . Give him the wide-open reaches of the Martin Beck and a company of 11 , as some unwise producers have done just recently , and he might as well be vanishing into one of the blackest of the universe ' s black holes. // In fact , during the first 20 minutes or so of a play by Ed Graczyk called " Come Back to the 5 and Dime Jimmy Dean , Jimmy Dean , " I had the eerie feeling that I wasn ' t really trying to locate or identify the actors milling about on an already monstrously cluttered stage , I was really straining my eyes to see if I couldn ' t find director Altman . I had the feeling he had to be up there , darting about among the wandering players somewhere , his eye to the camera ' s viewfinder , his free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the performer now whispering . For it was only from the stage - with viewfinder and mike in hand - that anyone could possibly have hoped to see or hear what was going on. // Never did find him . Mr. Altman had made the simplest , the most elementary mistake that any director coming from one medium to another could make . He hadn ' t figured out how he was going to get in touch with his audience . Most stage directors do begin their work up on stage , fairly close to their actors . But they know that , important as the actors are , the show isn ' t being performed for them . Thus , as the play ' s action is gradually blocked out and its line readings begin to make sense , the director will normally hie himself off that platform and begin taking a somewhat broader look at the situation from the front rows of the house . Is the enterprise acquiring a shape - visually , vocally - for the folk out front ? Five days later you ' re likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the darkened auditorium . By the end of rehearsals you can look for him ' way back , doing his nail-biting from the very last row or perhaps knotted into a kind of leaning crouch over the railing just behind . He ' s got to be sure that the tentative and intimate tones that seemed so promising when everyone began work three weeks ago have now expanded to embrace the entire building , balcony preferably included. // This is pretty primitive talk , I must admit , but Mr. Altman ' s lapses are of a primitive sort and must be dealt with . At the opening of the second half of " Jimmy Dean , Jimmy Dean , " a young actor who did indeed resemble Jimmy Dean ( but who was not playing Jimmy Dean , nor any reasonable facsimile thereof ) stumbled through a screen door into the musty disorder of a down-at-heels Woolworth ' s in Texas , reeled briefly so that we could notice that his coveralls had been ripped open to the crotch , then pitched forward onto the floor , patently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women present , all but one ignored the young man ' s evident need for succor and went on speaking of their own private concerns - rather as though each inhabited an entirely separate play. // The only good Samaritan in the lot turned out to be a cocktail waitress played by Cher , of television fame , and she helped the young man into a seat on the upstage side of the soda counter . Cher , by the way , seems a likable , workable performer , and I would not wish to judge her future prospects in the theater by the various things that happened to her here . In any event , she took some pains to console the youngster , and I wish I had been able to see and hear her doing it . The problem wasn ' t so much whispering at this point - Cher has some spunk about her and had begun to connect with the customers on her own initiative - as the fact that Mr. Altman had placed a much heftier woman smack in front of her . This heftier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowgirl hat she was wearing , was not actually needed onstage at this time or any other . She made no vital or even minuscule contribution to the plot . She was there for no other purpose than to obscure our view of the one thing going on in which we might possibly have taken a momentary interest. // Various performers , including Cher , were occasionally given substantial speeches detailing their own private histories , including mastectomies , transsexual alterations , and the delights of having intercourse in village graveyards ( it ' s best with your back on a fallen tombstone ) . Whenever material of such import was about to be delivered , the actor would be required to turn his or her ( mostly her ) back to the auditorium and confide the play ' s key secrets to the rear brick wall . Now it is not impossible to deliver speeches with one ' s back to the audience . David Garrick is known to have done it . Need I say that it is unadvisable , if not downright unfair , to ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bag ? // Otherwise , our determined director had littered the evening with some devices that had been half-borrowed from films ( lending , no doubt , a " cinematic " quality to the proceedings ) and some devices that seemed to belong to no medium at all ( unless , perhaps , you had at least three of the four Marx Brothers on hand ) . // Jump-cut flashback department : Sandy Dennis , proclaiming herself the mother of Jimmy Dean ' s only child , walked out a door in a snit and instantly returned all smiles - because it was now , without pause or purpose , 20 years earlier . **27;29;TOOLONG department : everything in sight was supposed to be mirrored , as some Woolworth ' s walls were once upon a time mirrored . This was easy enough to do above the actors ' heads . Mr. Altman had simply ordered his designer to paint , say , a Back to School poster on the wall over that screen door . He then had a reverse image of the same poster painted directly adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay phone , a city directory hanging on the wall , anything you like that ' s inert. // Getting the effect with moving actors , however , was considerably more difficult . To establish the premise , the director had provided waitresses Sudie Bond and Cher with doubles who echoed their every movement as they cleaned up counters for the day . Unluckily , these lookalikes seemed under-rehearsed , making gestures that were sadly out of sync with those of the principals . To compound the confusion , Mr. Altman dropped the practice after the first two or three minutes , so that when Sandy Dennis came on she brought no mirror-image with her . This had the effect of making her seem more insubstantial than she actually is these days , rather Dracula-like ( you will recall that Dracula ' s image did not register in mirrors , causing him to smash them when possible ) . // Having taken in all of this self-contradictory detail , we spent the next hour and a half wondering if it had ever had any potential significance . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learned , sort of . Suddenly the boy who looked like Jimmy Dean ( but wasn ' t ) and a transsexual in a great auburn wig ( Karen Black , known to be talented ) were standing at adjacent counters as though they reflected each other , making nervous gestures and odd twists of their torsos in identical rhythm . This proved , apparently , that these two were one and the same person , their psyches separated by 20 years in time . The information was scarcely worth the wait , especially since it was all repeated in the dialogue a few minutes later. // Mr. Altman had piled gimmick on gimmick , irrelevant device upon irrelevant device , making his able players look like amateurs as they prowled vacantly through a kind of junkshop that would have served for a musical version of " American Buffalo . " The director seemed to be approaching the theater as though it could be all things to all men , all women , all at once - and then had forgotten where those men and women would be seated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he hadn ' t bothered to search for it. // Mr. Friedkin did nothing so untidy with Tom Kempinski ' s quickly departed " Duet for One , " but he appeared to run into a contrary conviction : he couldn ' t seem to persuade himself that the stage was flexible at all . As Anne Bancroft , who was permitted or persuaded to give a monotonously shrill performance , rolled her wheelchair into the offices of psychoanalyst Max von Sydow , she arrived at a spot near upstage center from which she could glare most ferociously at the man who wished to help her . Mr. von Sydow , for his part , remained quite patiently fixed in a listening position , downstage right . Occasionally , though not too often , the two would switch sides of the room , Miss Bancroft rolling across to upstage right while her doctor obligingly moved downstage left to continue prodding her about her depressions. // In short order we were all depressed , in part because the play proper was far too sluggish in getting past the obvious fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been incapacitated by muscular dystrophy , in part because Mr. Friedkin could not find more than two possible visual and psychological positions for his players to adopt . The theater is more flexible than that , it offers a playing field on which many an unsuspected pattern can be displayed . But its resources , its nooks and crannies and ways of getting about , are subtle ; they need probing at length to flush out the variety that ' s possible . Coming from the unlimited flexibility of films , Mr. Friedkin clearly felt cramped. // Down the years dozens of directors have managed the switch between stage and screen , shuttling back and forth more successfully . I begin to wonder if this doubling in brass comes easier when the director has trained himself to lick the problems of the more difficult stage first. //
