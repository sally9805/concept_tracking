It was the red and white of the California Angels and not the blue pinstripe of the Yanks . This was his first time back to New York City in a baseball uniform of any kind since the World Series last year. // Now it was a full four and a half hours before the start of the ball game . Earlier in the day , at a news conference for a baseball shoe he is sponsoring , Jackson said he was feeling " skittish " about returning to New York . " I ' ve got butterflies , " he said. // The end of a turbulent and dramatic five-year career with the Yankees came over the winter when the owner of the team , George Steinbrenner , a shipbuilder by profession , did not renew his contract. // The stands were empty now , and the loudest sound was the rumble of the Woodlawn elevated train just beyond the park . There were no cries of " Reg-gie , Reg-gie , " as there had been for the last five years in which he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the Yankees fell behind . The fans hoped that Steinbrenner the Shipbuilder would hear their displeasure over the loss of the slugger. // And there was no one now floating through the stands wearing a Yankee cap and a white bedsheet with No. 44 on the back . Stepping into the batting cage now was no ghost , this was the real thing - or what has been passing for the real thing. // Reggie , after all , was hitting only . 173 this season , with no extra base hits - he had nine singles - and only four runs batted in - and three of those r. b. i. coming when he made outs. // " I had heard about the chants and the guy dressed like a ghost , " Reggie had said . " I ' m just glad they don ' t read the stats . " Jackson hit for 40 minutes off Coach Bobby Knoop , sometimes lunging at pitches and sending them up to stick in the screen of the batting cage , and sometimes , with that powerful , rippling stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // After the batting practice , Jackson was brought into a room for another news conference . He was affable , even mellow . " I guess it ' s a matter of maturity , of getting older , " he said . He will be 36 on May 18 . Jackson has had difficult personal experiences with the Yankees , from battles with Billy Martin , the former Yankee manager , to Steinbrenner the Shipbuilder . And now he is trying to do well with a new team and struggling. // " I ' ve been not wanting to come back and then wanting to come back , " he said . " New York City is still the place I ' m very familiar with , still like very much . And the people have been great , warm and receptive. // He was asked what ' s wrong at the plate . " I ' m just not feeling comfortable at the plate , in my home turf - and I don ' t know why . " Was he trying too hard ? " That ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m trying to hit three home runs at one time at bat . " Are you sorry about leaving New York ? " I would have loved to finish my career here . But George didn ' t think it was the thing to do . " Jackson had become a free agent after the 1981 season . Was he ever made an offer by the Yankees ? " No . " He went on : " I was kind of made a fool of . George cast doubts about whether I could play anymore , about my worth , and quality and character to be a Yankee. // " I got tired of being run down by him . " Reggie ' s voice softened . " I didn ' t want to prostitute myself to come back , I wasn ' t going to bow down to the guy . " Now the Angels were about to take official batting practice . And when Jackson came down the runway to the dugout , he stepped on white towels - the old white-carpet treatment - set out by Rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Jackson laughed , fooled around at the bat rack for several minutes , then stepped out onto the field . The small early crowd cheered as they saw Reggie ' s number : 44 On the scoreboard , the digital clock read 6 : 44. // When Jackson ran out to play right field in the bottom of the first inning , the crowd of 35 , 458 , most holding colorful umbrellas against the thin rain , gave him a standing ovation and the familiar Reg-gie chant . Later , a guy in a T-shirt would run out and present Jackson with a bouquet of yellow flowers. // In the second inning , batting in the sixth position against Ron Guidry , he popped up very high to second base . He was clearly trying to drive the ball out of the park , and he was clearly disappointed. // In the fifth , Jackson singled past second base . It was a good shot , but it wasn ' t what he wanted. // By the seventh , the rain was coming down harder . Jackson would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpires , trying to get the game called since the Angels were ahead , 2-1. // But the game continued . Jackson toweled off his black bat , wiped his glasses and stepped into the batter ' s box . On Guidry ' s first pitch , he swung . The crack of the bat resounded through the park . The ball rocketed . Jackson dropped his bat , clapped his hands in pure and unadulterated delight . The ball was into the right-field upper deck for a home run before he had taken three steps. // There was a moment of shock , then the fans thundered applause . And chanted his name , and kept chanting it so that , after he had ducked into the dugout , he was forced to come out into the rain and wave his arms to them. // When Jackson departed into the dugout , shortly another chant began , starting slowly , and then swelling until the entire ball park was throbbing with it . It was an obscenity directed at Steinbrenner , who was in the ball park - and repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning , Jackson was replaced in right field by Juan Beniquez . For Jackson , though , the game was complete . And on this rainy , miserable April night , the home run was a moment to remember - his first extra-base hit of the season. //
