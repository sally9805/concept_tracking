They have two of the most familiar names in transportation , but for many years they have been battling each other in a business that was going rapidly downhill . Last week the archcompetitors of the open road decided that joining forces might be the best way to survive . Greyhound Lines , the nation 's biggest bus company , announced that it would buy rival Trailways for $80 million . If the merger is completed , the U.S. will be down to its last national bus line . <P> Bus ridership has declined sharply with the growth of car ownership and the burgeoning popularity of air travel . The toughest blow came in 1978 , when deregulation of the airline industry spawned a fleet of cut-rate carriers . On some routes plane fares became as cheap as bus tickets . It was no surprise , then , that between 1980 and 1985 total intercity bus travel dropped by 29% , from 27.4 billion passenger miles to 19.5 billion . <P> Among those travelers who remained loyal to buses , more and more chose small regional lines rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled just 30 million passengers , less than half of the 64 million a year that it transported a decade ago . Greyhound earned only about $35 million last year on revenues of $640 million . Forced to tighten its operations , the company since 1983 has eliminated 2,000 towns and cities from its 14,000-stop , 48-state system . <P> Trailways , which lost $8 million last year , has fared worse . The firm , which serves more than 1,000 communities , has pulled out of entire regions during the past five years , eliminating its New England service and dropping or severely reducing routes in , among other states , Missouri , Kansas , Nebraska and Colorado . <P> The impetus for the proposed merger came from Fred Currey , a Dallas entrepreneur who bought Greyhound Lines from the Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp . in March . Soon after the purchase , Currey , who had been chief executive of Trailways during the 1970s , began negotiations to acquire his old firm as well . He hopes that the Interstate Commerce Commission will approve the merger on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help gain support for the deal , Currey pledged last week that Greyhound would not abandon some 400 towns , including Albany , Ga. , and Fort Polk , La. , that are now served exclusively by Trailways.
