At one time , some 10 years ago , it was thought that the John F. Kennedy Library might be the means to catalyze the physical renaissance of Cambridge , beginning with Harvard Square . But the people of Cambridge thought otherwise , particularly the wealthy and powerful of Brattle street ' s Neighborhood Ten . Fierce , clever and well- financed , they litigated the library to its present shoreline site , beside UMass Boston . Their contention - that the Kennedy Library and museum would attract " hordes of tourists " has not , as regards the Dorchester site , proved true , but perhaps , as some believe , the argument was never initially sincere . They predicted that the library and its museum would turn Harvard Square into a junky , fast-food emporium . Events have shown that Harvard Square has done so unassisted by the library . Whether the library could , in fact , have catalyzed beneficial change we ' ll never know . But that is the past . Now the question is : Will what is coming in its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact , physically and socially , of the two massive developments arising in the area where the Kennedy Library was planned , an area a home run ' s distance from Harvard Square . The side-by-side developments are University Place , already rising , leasee Harvard University , and Charles Square , otherwise known as Parcel 1B , due to start in May . These two developments will include approximately 170 large condominiums , office space , retail and restaurants , a 300-room luxury hotel and parking for almost 1300 automobiles . Charles Square , a project of Carpenter &; Co. , and Cambridge Seven Associates , by far the larger of the two complexes , is a powerful development in size and style . Its 86 condominiums , which will face the river across a park fronting Memorial drive , will range in price , per unit , from one quarter to three- quarters of a million dollars - surely a high in condominium prices in the Boston area . The miracle is that the Cambridge Defense Fund , many of whose members , under a different name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept this fairly massive project at least by Cambridge standards - top height 110 feet . It didn ' t happen easily . Nothing in the way of development does in Cambridge , a city of professors , politicians , poets , pupils , professionals , proletariat and parvenue . Nor did it happen without early bloodshed as past and current Defense Fund presidents - Dean Johnson and Pebble Gifford - readily admit . Johnson , leading the Defense Fund fight , battled toe to toe with Richard Friedman , president of Carpenter &; Co. and , as he puts it , " won some concessions in scale , a reduction in size . " Friedman , who had something going for him as a Cambridge native and former Harvard University ski coach , acknowledges that Defense Fund criticism produced a sounder project . But while Johnson , Gifford and Friedman now laugh and break bread together , the former still have some reservations . What , however , everyone seems to agree on is that the MBTA Red Line extension to Alewife , which included federal transit funds for surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square . For the first time in decades Harvard Square will have some of the grace its heritage demands - handsome 20-foot wide brick sidewalks , large new trees , bicycle racks beside the new MBTA entrance , new pieces of art both above and below ground and at least one outdoor sidewalk cafe . But the square needs more than a physical renaissance and hopes are that the new projects , adding a new mix of people , will ease the fast-food atmosphere of the square , restoring it to what it once was - a more basic shopping center . Defense Fund leaders also hope that Harvard , which owns so much property around the square , will become a more sensitive landlord and not always lease to the highest ( fast-food ) bidder . Harvard Square should be one of the world ' s great internationalcrossroads , deserves to be , but has fallen short . Perhaps this is about to change . It will be interesting to watch .                   @ @
