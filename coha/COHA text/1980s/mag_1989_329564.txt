More than 25 years ago , Desafinado and The Girl from Ipanema swayed the world to the sinuous sound of bossa nova . Now a new generation of musicians is discovering the old seducer : Brazil . Some of the world 's leading pop stars  --  David Byrne , Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel among them  --  are intent on weaving novel strands of ethnic music into a fresh , global sound . They have been flying down to Rio for inspiration and coming back laden with rhythm . <P> Earlier this year Byrne , the leader of Talking Heads , assembled a sampling of 1970s Brazilian pop on the Fly/Sire Records album Beleza Tropical : Brazil Classics Vol . I. This month a follow-up collection , O Samba : Brazil Classics Vol. 2 , is due to appear , along with Rei Momo , Byrne 's solo album based on Brazilian and other Latin song styles . Simon is planning to include Brazilian- inspired material in his next album , scheduled for release in early 1990 . Gabriel , whose new Real World label focuses on non-Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temptation of Christ on the sounds of Brazil and Africa . Brazil 's influence is also acknowledged by Roberta Flack on her late- 1988 album Oasis . " Under a warm Rio night/ We danced on the edge , " she coos in a number dedicated to Brazilian singer-composer Djavan . " And my heart stood still/ Oh , Brazil , Oh , Brazil . " <P> U.S. record-company executives are crooning the same refrain . At Polygram , vice president Richard Seidel is overseeing a new " Brazilian Wave " series that includes anthology albums for a number of major Brazilian pop stars . Celluloid , an independent U.S. label , has launched a subsidiary called Braziloid , dedicated to musica popular brasileira , a term used by Brazilians to refer to the country 's diverse contemporary sounds . CBS Records is promoting Brazilian stars like Djavan and Rio de Janeiro-born vocalist Milton Nascimento as pop acts in the U.S. <P> It is rhythm  --  lots of rhythm  --  that accounts for the new craze , and a good deal of the beat comes from the state of Bahia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , African tribal dances are blended with European sounds to create the insistent samba ; the afoxe , associated with the Afro-Roman Catholic Candomble religion ; and the chugging , accordion-dominated forro , which blends African rhythms with Portuguese folk music . Says U.S. guitarist Arto Lindsay , co-producer with Peter Scherer of the latest album by an eminent Brazilian performer , Caetano Veloso : " In Bahia and the north you find the purest African rhythms , some of the most innovative in Brazil . " Notes Byrne : " Bahia may be to Brazil what New Orleans was as the birthplace of jazz  --  a source of musical ideas that are later refined into new styles . " Brazilian music , he explains , allows him to feel " the direct link between the ecstatic release of rhythmically based popular songs and the spirituality that is ( ( at ) ) their roots .
