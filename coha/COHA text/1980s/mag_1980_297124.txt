A freshman flash helps put Georgia back on top <P> With one game left to play in the 1979 season , the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama faced the prospect of a tie for the Southeastern Conference championship . The title carries an invitation to the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans . But under Sugar Bowl rules , in the event of an S.E.C. tie , the team that had been to New Orleans most recently would be ineligible . Thus Alabama , ranked No. 1 in the nation and Sugar Bowl hosts two straight years , would stay home on New Year 's Day unless it could win its final game against Auburn . <P> Normally , such a situation would lead to rejoicing in Georgia . But for all their success in the S.E.C. , the Bulldogs had been cuffed around by non-conference opponents . " This time last year , " Georgia Coach Vince Dooley recalls with a rueful smile , " we had a shot at going to the Sugar Bowl with a record of six wins and five losses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and spared us . This year , things are a little bit different . " <P> Indeed they are . With a single game remaining , Georgia is the only unbeaten and untied major college team in the country . Undisputed S.E.C. champions , the team has in hand an invitation to play No. 2-ranked Notre Dame . For good measure , Georgia has replaced Alabama as the top-ranked team in both the Associated Press sportswriters ' poll and the United Press International coaches ' poll , the first time since World War II that the Bulldogs have led the national rankings . Jubilant Georgians are unfurling bumper stickers that marvel : HOW ' BOUT THEM DAWGS . <P> The Bulldogs ' remarkable seesaw began with preseason events both ridiculous and sublime . Dooley nearly lost six players because of disciplinary infractions . But he gained one player who has , almost singlehanded , put the Georgians on top once again : Herschel Walker , one of the flashiest running backs in the history of college football . The best news is that Walker is only a freshman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pop . 2,106 ) , Walker was the most sought-after schoolboy player in the country last year . The 6-ft. 2-in. , 220-lb. running back rushed for 6,137 yds. in high school and set national records by scoring 85 touchdowns , 45 of them during his senior year . He was also state champion in the shotput ( 54 ft. ) and the 100-yd. dash ( 9.5 sec . ) . Son of a chalk-mine foreman , Walker graduated with honors . <P> So intense was the recruiting war for Walker that the mere sight of an out-of-state coach in Wrightsville could set off a small panic . When a man named John Robinson checked into a hotel in nearby Macon , local newspapers announced with alarm that the University of Southern California 's coach had come to cart Walker away . John Robinson turned out to be a salesman from Huntsville , Ala.
