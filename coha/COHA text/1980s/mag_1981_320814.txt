At college commencements , babies , trumpets , politics as usual <P> This spring , as usual , assorted elders have been capped , gowned and summoned to daises across the U.S. to try to say something wise , important or at least heartfelt to the year 's 1.3 million new college graduates . Their collective mood was somber , reflecting anxiety over the arms race , education and the Government 's new budget . Some speakers used the campus rostrum for political oratory . One university , Fairleigh Dickinson in Rutherford , N.J. , chose not to have a speaker . Instead the students called in Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie , creator of bebop , and let him play his songs Ow and Groovin ' High . The campus visit briefly unsettled Gillespie . Afterward the jazzman recalled with a chuckle : " I looked at my program and read , ' Commencement address : Dizzy Gillespie . ' I was terrified . Everybody knows a jazz trumpeter 's instrument doesn ' t wake up until 10 at night . " In short , as usual , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor as well . A commencement sampler : <P> <P> Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale at Brandeis University in Waltham , Mass. : " At the United Nations , we have often stood alone-when the issue was too important morally for us to join the rest . Yet in May the United States again stood alone . We voted to oppose restraints on efforts to lead women in developing countries away from healthy breast-feeding to dependence on milk substitutes that , improperly used , risk infection and stunted growth ... Some Administration spokesmen now say that there is a difference between right-wing authoritarianism and left-wing totalitarianism , and that we must tolerate the terror of the one , but must condemn that of the other . <P> But torture is torture , and terror is terror . <P> And whether it occurs in Cuba , Russia , Viet Nam , Argentina , Chile or El Salvador , we in America should oppose it , condemn it , and do our best to stop it . " <P> Vice President George Bush at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rhetorical heat as human rights . Our Administration is pledged to human rights . Some feel we must shout from the rooftops and humiliate countries in order to effect change . We do n't agree . But the debate is not enhanced by name-calling or moralizing or questioning our motives . Results are what count , not rhetorical confrontation . " <P> Cartoonist Garry Trudeau at Colby College in Waterville , Me. : " You live in a deeply cynical world where generosity is in short supply , a world where taking a stand has come to mean finding the nearest trap door for escape . <P> There is something disturbing in our society when men wish not to be esteemed , but to be envied . " <P> <P> Thomas J. Watson , longtime chairman of IBM and ex-U.S . Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. , at Harvard University : " By overwhelming odds , the result of any use of nuclear weapons would not be victory .
