Reagan offers tax credits <P> Ronald Reagan could not have picked a better audience ( 4,200 members of the National Catholic Educational Association ) , or a more fitting date ( April 15 , the deadline for filing tax returns ) . His speech was chock-full of applause lines , and he hit nearly every one on cue . " I believe that working Americans are overtaxed and underappreciated . " Cheers and applause . " I have come to Chicago to propose another tax bill that will allow them to keep a little more of their own money . I have come to propose a tuition tax credit for parents . . . " At this point , his listeners rose to their feet , roaring their support and drowning out his words . After the clamor died down , Reagan finished his sentence : " This tax credit will be for parents who bear the double burden of public and private school costs . " <P> It was a gratifying reception for a President who has not heard a lot of applause lately . But elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers . Republican Bob Packwood of Oregon and Democrat Daniel Moynihan of New York introduced a tuition tax credit bill in the Senate in 1977 , and a bitter debate has been raging ever since . Indeed , even as Reagan basked in last week 's cheers , opponents of the program were mobilizing . <P> Under Reagan 's proposal , families with adjusted gross annual incomes of $50,000 or less would be allowed to take a tax credit up to $ 100 in 1983 for each child in private elementary or secondary schools , up to $300 in 1984 , up to $500 thereafter . Families earning between $50,000 and $75,000 would be eligible for partial credits . Declared Reagan : " We are offering help to the inner-city child who faces a world of drugs and crime , the child with special needs , and to families who still believe the Lord 's Prayer will do them less harm in the schoolroom than good . " <P> Opponents claim that credits would violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state , since 80% of private school students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation would damage the public school system by encouraging parents to put their children in private schools ; an estimated 5 million students are enrolled in private schools , compared with 40 million in public schools , and that ratio has remained fairly steady over the past 15 years . Moreover , the tax credits would drain away funds needed to improve public education . Says Albert Shanker , president of the American Federation of Teachers : " There is no more reason to pay for private education than there is to pay for a private swimming pool for those who do not use public facilities . " <P> Supporters contend that the plan would benefit those who most need help . <P> <P> According to Gary Jones , a deputy under secretary of the Department of Education , 54% of the families sending children to private schools make less than $25,000 a year . Trying to blunt the church-state issue , Reagan stressed that the tax credits would go not to parochial schools but to the parents themselves . The President also emphasized that no credits would go to families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he argued that strengthening private schools would force public schools to improve their programs .
