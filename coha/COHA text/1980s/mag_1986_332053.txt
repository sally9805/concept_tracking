The bombing attack against Libya is the most dramatic example to date of an important theme in the foreign policy of the Reagan Administration : a determination to use American military power against enemies anywhere in the world , regardless of whether the U.S. has the support of its allies . Being a superpower often means not having to say either please or sorry . <P> Pundits and political scientists have a fancy , almost tongue-tying bit of jargon for this tendency : global unilateralism . That phrase has been bandied about by both admirers and critics of the Administration , as well as by others who are ambivalent about official American attitudes and behavior . <P> Several other examples of global unilateralism look , in retrospect , like dress rehearsals for this latest , most spectacular and most controversial military clash in the Reagan era . In 1981 the U.S. Navy made quick work of Gaddafi 's air force over the Gulf of Sidra , and late last month the U.S. bloodied those waters again . There were also the 1983 invasion of Grenada and last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers aboard . <P> The new American penchant for going it alone is also apparent in two more general commitments of the Administration : the so-called Reagan Doctrine of support for anti-Communist guerrilla movements and the Strategic Defense Initiative , or Star Wars . <P> The Reagan Doctrine holds that the U.S. should bypass nervous and sometimes unreliable foreign friends in order to harass and , if possible , overthrow Moscow 's clients in the Third World . SDI , as originally conceived by Reagan in 1983 , was a deus ex machina of global unilateralism : a made-in-the-U.S.A. system for effectively disarming the Soviet Union and any other foreign threat to the U.S. ( including , in a number of scenarios , a nuclear-armed Gaddafi or other Islamic firebrand . <P> These policies  --  whether quick-and-dirty one-shot actions such as Sidra I , II and III or long-term strategies such as the Reagan Doctrine and Star Wars  --  have evoked mixed reactions abroad . Denis Healey , the British Labor Party 's most prominent spokesman on foreign policy , has continually protested global unilateralism in so many words . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz word in the Esperanto of Uncle Sam bashing , denounced the U.S. for " neoglobalism . " At the same time , public remonstrations from the chancelleries of Europe and elsewhere have often been modulated with whispered encouragement to Washington to keep up the good work . The point about global unilateralism , however , is not whether others like it or not , but that the U.S. no longer cares quite so much one way or the other . <P> . While the Reagan Administration has given global unilateralism both doctrinal and operational standing that it did not have before , the phenomenon has been around for decades . After World War II , the U.S. found itself with global interests , global responsibilities and global reach . It also had in the Soviet Union an adversary of far-reaching ambitions and capabilities . Yet American alliances were , and remained , essentially regional . In the ' 50s and ' 60s , the U.S. worked hard to give its allies a sense that they were partners in the U.S. 's worldwide mission .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
