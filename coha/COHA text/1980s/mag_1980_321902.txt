Under the new rules , even the richest candidates go broke <P> " An abomination , " says Richard Viguerie , a fund raiser for John Connally . " Absolutely counterproductive , " echoes Larry Pryor , an aide to Jerry Brown . " An overreaction to the Nixon campaign , " says Morris Dees , chief fund raiser for Ted Kennedy . <P> The target of this abuse is not a candidate or a presidential policy but a federal law that these aides agree has seriously impeded their fund raising and has hurt their candidates . All three campaigns , in fact , are close to going broke . <P> Kennedy 's aides have just been put on half salary after getting no paychecks for a month . Last week both Brown and Connally suspended staff salaries , and Connally closed down campaign operations in all states that choose delegates after March 18 . Vows a penurious but defiant Brown : " We 'll hitchhike to the convention if we have to . " <P> Passed by Congress in 1974 and amended in 1976 , the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual contributions of more than $1,000 . If the candidate wants to receive federal campaign matching funds , he must stay within a $17.7 million limit during the caucuses and primaries and spend no more than $50,000 of his own and his family 's money . Only Connally has refused matching funds . <P> In a stroke , the new limits wiped out the influence of the fat-cat contributors . No longer can a few well-heeled backers keep a candidate alive if he does not seem to have popular support . If he can not get the votes , he can not get the money . Both Kennedy and Connally raised large war chests ( as of the end of January , $6.1 million by Kennedy , $10 million by Connally ) . But when they faltered in the polls and initial caucuses , their contributions fell off . Since they had spent lavishly without much regard for the future , they were in trouble . In contrast , donations to George Bush soared after he won the Iowa caucuses . People voted with their pocketbooks early in the presidential race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , candidates more than ever before have had to become their own fund raisers-one of their most difficult and demeaning duties . They have become so involved in the finances of their campaigns , thinks Republican Congressman Richard Cheney of Wyoming , who was President Ford 's chief of staff , that they are " better equipped to serve as Budget Director than as President . " <P> Nothing has higher priority with the candidates than keeping their coffers from going empty . Even though he was badly lagging in New Hampshire , Howard Baker had to give up a day 's campaigning last week to go hat in hand to three fund raisers in Detroit ( his take : more than $30,000 ) . Says Larry Pryor of Brown 's campaign : " A disproportionate amount of our energy goes to scrounging for small donations . We 're like people that have to scratch all day for ground nuts and never get a chance to think of higher things . "                   @ @
