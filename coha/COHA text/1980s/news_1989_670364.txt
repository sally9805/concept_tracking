LONDON  --  In a move that could sway the takeover battle for Gateway PLC , Goldman , Sachs &; Co. began making markets in unissued equity units of Isosceles PLC . The Isosceles bidding consortium is locked in a duel with a buy-out group led by Wasserstein , Perella &; Co. for Gateway , Britain ' s third-largest food retailer . Yesterday ' s step by Goldman , a U.S. investment bank , boosts pressure on the Wasserstein group as it vies to complete Europe ' s biggest leveraged buy-out . Late yesterday , Goldman said the so-called Isosceles equity stub  --  representing the equity portion of Isosceles ' s cash-and-stock bid  --  was valued at 26 pence ( 42. 4 cents ) bid , 31 pence ( 50. 6 cents ) offered . The value is slightly below Isosceles ' most recent estimates , but makes its bid nearly identical to Wasserstein Perella ' s all-cash offer . At Goldman ' s prices , Isosceles ' s cash-and-equity bid values each Gateway share at between 241 pence and 246 pence , and the entire company at between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 billion ( $3. 57 billion ) . Newgateway PLC , an investment vehicle formed by Wasserstein Perella and Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. , is making an all-cash offer of 242 pence a share , or #2. 155 billion . Isosceles also has offered a cash bid of 230 pence a share , or #2. 05 billion . Goldman ' s intervention shows how aggressive American bid tactics increasingly are setting the pace in contested U.K. bids . Though rarely employed in the U.K. , pre-issue market making is a classic technique in American corporate finance . Its use here now underscores how the Gateway transaction is changing the landscape of European corporate finance . The transaction is the first significant contested leveraged buy-out in Europe and probably will lead to further leveraged buy-outs here . In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing . Ultimately , the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company ' s operations or sale of its assets . By providing a firm market price for the new equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isosceles , whose bid expires Friday . The consortium already owns or has acceptances for about 44% of Gateway ' s shares . Some U.K. institutions that otherwise might have cashed out their Gateway holdings now may accept Isosceles ' s cash-and-paper offer , knowing they could quickly sell in the market . The situation looks " increasingly reassuring to the Isosceles camp , " said Ernie McKnight , who directs U.K. equities at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow , Scotland , which holds less than 1% of Gateway . " At the present moment , the stub looks reasonably attractive and certainly there is going to be a reasonable , liquid market . " The Isosceles group , organized by the British merchant bank S.G. Warburg &; Co. , includes Globe Investment Trust PLC and Mercury Asset Management Ltd . , Gateway ' s two major institutional shareholders . Globe and Mercury agreed to put up #200 million in equity capital for the restructured Gateway . The Goldman step saps some momentum from Newgateway , which in the past week had made significant strides in convincing the U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . Gateway shares were unchanged at 240 pence in active trading late yesterday on London ' s Stock Exchange , as analysts said Newgateway probably increased its stake of just over 30% . Newgateway was trying to regain its momentum last night . Individuals close to the buy-out group said it raised its Gateway stake yesterday by about one percentage point , and said it expects Isosceles to announce it has lost one or two percentage points of its acceptances . The individuals assailed the Goldman price as significantly below the 30 pence to 35 pence per-share value most recently estimated for the stub by Isosceles advisers , and asserted that trading in the unissued shares remains illiquid . The Goldman market-making facility also could rebound to Wasserstein Perella ' s advantage . If clear investor appetite doesn ' t emerge for this new unissued equity , its price could fall well below yesterday ' s indication . Friday ' s deadline increasingly looms as a stalemate in the battle , which began last April with a #1. 87 billion bid from Isosceles . Isosceles needs to control only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newgateway has said it doesn ' t intend to accept Isosceles ' s offer regardless of the outcome . The stage could be set for a period of horse trading , with each side trying to gain Gateway assets in return for its stake . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
