Like the Royal Navy and India , the pound had always been a jewel in the British imperial crown . But last week the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had to rush to rescue the once proud pound from sinking below $1 in value . The pound has always been something of an anomaly in international currency markets . While it takes several deutsche marks or French francs , and hundreds of Japanese yen , to equal one U.S. dollar , the British pound is the only major Western currency worth more than a dollar . In 1949 a pound was worth $4.03 , and as recently as 1980 it was $2.41 . <P> At the start of last week 's currency trading , however , the pound had dropped to $1.1132 in London and only slightly more in New York , and it was sinking fast . Prime Minister Thatcher , an ardent champion of free markets , had always opposed official attempts to prop up a currency 's value , but enough was enough . Said one minister : " No government sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On Monday the Thatcher government ordered the Bank of England to boost its prime lending rate from 10.5% to 12% , forcing corporate rates and home mortgages even higher . The new interest rates halted the fall of the pound by attracting new foreign capital into the country . During the rest of the week , the pound rose slightly and closed on Friday in New York at $1.1210 . <P> The latest run on the pound was triggered primarily by concerns about the future of world oil prices . Because of the current glut in crude , petroleum + prices have been sliding for several months . Britain earns nearly $13 billion from the export of oil , and lower prices would be a serious blow to its economy . <P> The sinking pound was a new and embarrassing political problem for Thatcher . Opposition Leader Neil Kinnock called her handling of the crisis an " epic of bungling indecision . " Two weeks ago , Thatcher 's press secretary , Bernard Ingham , aggravated the tense situation by telling reporters that they could be " absolutely certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the pound . That unfortunate remark helped speed the currency 's slide and forced Thatcher to abandon her hands-off policy . <P> The pound 's troubles brought a sense of urgency to a routine meeting in Washington of finance ministers from the U.S. , Britain , France , West Germany and Japan . After the session , Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said that the U.S. had eased the conditions under which it would intervene to try to influence prices in the currency markets . Said Regan : " We are willing to undertake coordinated intervention when we agree that it would be helpful . " Previously the Administration had said it would buy or sell dollars or other currencies solely to prevent " disorderly " markets . The Government intervened only in such serious situations as after the shooting of President Reagan in 1981 and during the near collapse last May of Chicago 's Continental Illinois bank . <P> Treasury officials , however , quickly pointed out that there has been no change in the Reagan Administration 's opposition to fixing the dollar 's value . Said one senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market forces is like spitting into the wind . "
