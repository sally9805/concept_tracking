One late afternoon eight years ago , Griffiths Mxenge , a well-known black lawyer and antiapartheid campaigner in the city of Durban , was driving home when he stopped to help four men whose pickup truck had apparently broken down . According to an affidavit given to the police , the men abducted Mxenge , drove him to a field outside a nearby soccer stadium , stabbed him repeatedly and then left him to die in a pool of blood . <P> Since 1977 nearly 50 government opponents have been murdered under murky circumstances , the victims of apparent assassinations . Few of their killers have been identified , let alone apprehended by the authorities . Last week long-standing suspicions that police hit squads were behind at least some of the murders were bolstered by State President F.W. de Klerk 's decision to order an inquiry . He announced that the Ministry of Law and Order and the Ministry of Justice would conduct a fresh investigation into the allegedly political murders of Mxenge and 79 other victims , whose names were on a list that De Klerk gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under growing pressure to take action since the hit- squad affair burst onto the front pages of the country 's newspapers in October . At that time a prisoner on death row , former policeman Butana Almond Nofomela , alleged that he had been part of a team that " eliminated " Mxenge in 1981 . After being named in Nofomela 's affidavit , former police captain Dirk Coetzee went public in the weekly newspaper Vrye Weekblad with a story of how he headed a police hit squad between 1980 and 1982 that carried out at least nine assassinations , including that of Mxenge , as well as numerous bombings and abductions . " I was in the heart of the whore , " declared Coetzee , who accused senior police officers of authorizing assassinations . <P> In launching the new probe , officials said they would prosecute Nofomela for his role in Mxenge 's murder . They also planned to issue a warrant for Coetzee 's arrest . But tracking him down is proving to be difficult . Coetzee , who apparently made his confession out of fear that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled the country last month , and has been variously reported living in Europe , elsewhere in Africa and on the island of Mauritius .
