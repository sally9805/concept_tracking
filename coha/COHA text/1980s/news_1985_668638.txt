The Shawon Dunston watch continued before Tuesday night ' s game between the Cubs and the Dodgers , as manager Jim Frey and club president Dallas Green discussed sending the struggling rookie shortstop back to the minors . Dunston was not in the starting lineup when the Cubs opened a two-game series in Los Angeles . Former Cy Young Award winners Rick Sutcliffe and Fernando Valenzuela opposed each other in a packed Dodger Stadium . " I don ' t know when I ' ll play again , " Dunston said Tuesday afternoon . " Right now I ' m just sitting on the bench and watching and trying to learn something . " After the series in San Diego last weekend , Dunston said : " Nobody has said anything to me yet about going down . I don ' t want to go . I can ' t benefit by going to the minor leagues . I can ' t benefit from sitting on the bench . I ' m not hitting . Nobody on the team is hitting . I ' ve seen so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best to return Dunston to the Cubs ' Triple-A team in Des Moines . He said he was concerned about Dunston ' s pressing affecting the rest of the team . Frey said he is eager to see the 22-year-old Dunston succeed , " but he is not relaxed . Every at-bat seems like an ordeal for him . " Dallas and I talked about Dunston Monday afternoon , Monday night , Tuesday afternoon . . . we ' ve been talking about him for quite a while , " Frey said . " And we ' ll talk about it again tonight after the game . The considerations are what ' s best for the ballclub and for Shawon Dunston in the long run . " Larry Bowa started at shortstop Tuesday . Frey said that if Dunston is sent to the minors , he would play both Bowa and Chris Speier , " at least for a while until one of them began to take charge . " Should Dunston be sent down , it is thought that the Cubs would call up Brian Dayett , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both outfielders . Dunston is hitting . 194 and has committed nine errors . He made 58 errors last season , which he split between Des Moines , where he hit . 233 in 61 games , and Double-A Midland , where he batted . 329 in 73 games . " When we left Arizona , I thought Shawon had a chance to juice up our offense , " Frey said . " In spring training he showed me an offensive spurt . He ran around the bases like there were no fielders . When you see this guy making contact and getting on base , he can make things happen . I thought he could give us a lift offensively . But he has struggled here of late at the plate . His defense has bothered his hitting , instead of the other way around . Frustration is the word . " The Cubs have found it difficult to hide Dunston in a starting lineup that is already suffering at the plate . The Cubs entered Tuesday night ' s game hitting . 222 , and only . 206 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench for an extended period , Frey said : " It wouldn ' t be good to have him sit a lot . Sometimes the watching is as good as the playing , but not for too long a time . The organization , I ' m sure , wouldn ' t want that . I ' m sure Dallas Green would not be in favor of that . " Sutcliffe ' s appearance Tuesday night brought him back to the scene of his only regular-season defeat of 1984 , a 7-1 loss June 29 . Sutcliffe , who won NL Rookie of the Year honors as a Dodger in 1979 , beat San Francisco 1-0 in his last outing . " Overall , I ' d say Rick Sutcliffe has pitched very well this season , " Frey said . " He could just as easily be 6-1 instead of 4-3 . When he gets a five- or six-run lead , he ' s a tough son of a gun . The pitcher is subject to a lot of variables he can ' t control . Runs scored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Cubs were seeking to even their record on this trip and remain two games behind the first-place New York Mets , who beat Atlanta 3-1 earlier Tuesday .
