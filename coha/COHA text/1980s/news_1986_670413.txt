The Cabinet announced Wednesday that the head of the agency , which is roughly equivalent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , had been allowed to resign in exchange for immunity in the case . Three aides were also granted immunity , but were allowed to keep their jobs. // Today , the Israeli press , from the far right to far left , denounced Prime Minister Shimon Peres , President Chaim Herzog and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir for their handling of the incident , variously describing them as a behaving like a " junta " and engaging in a Watergate-style cover-up and conspiracy . The language was of a sort rarely seen in Israeli newspapers. // Among the other reactions , two Tel Aviv lawyers filed a petition with the Israeli High Court of Justice today , asking the judges to nullify the amnesty granted Wednesday by President Herzog to Avraham Shalom , the chief of Shin Beth , the domestic intelligence service , and the three deputies , in exchange for Mr. Shalom ' s resignation . <> <> Accused of a Cover-Up // Investigators had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured Palestinian bus hijackers in April 1984 , then covered up the affair with the help of his three deputies . In light of the presidential pardon , the Attorney General , Yosef Harish , called off all investigations into the case - even though Israeli press reports have suggested that Mr. Shamir , who was Prime Minister when the hijacking and killings took place , gave some kind of approval for the cover-up . His involvement remains unclarified by either himself or the courts. // There were signs today that the affair could turn into a political crisis that could threaten the coalition . Many members of the Labor Party are in an uproar over Mr. Peres ' s participation in the decision . They are demanding that an investigation be carried out and that , at least , the charges that Mr. Shamir was involved in the cover-up be examined. // Mr. Peres indicated today that while he believed the Shin Beth men had to be dealt with the way they were - to preserve the nation ' s security and the intelligence services - he would not object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political echelon . " Government sources said this was a clear hint that Mr. Peres was ready to have his and Mr. Shamir ' s roles in the affair examined . <> <> Planning Inquiry Demand // Energy Minister Moshe Shahal , of the Labor Party , announced that he would bring a demand for such an inquiry before the Cabinet on Sunday . The move has the support of the entire Labor Party . Labor officials say the matter must be resolved before Mr. Shamir assumes the prime ministership , as he is scheduled to do in October according to his power-sharing agreement with Mr. Peres. // The Likud bloc published a statement accusing Labor members who want an inquiry of " harming the President , the Government and the rule of law. " // Mr. Shamir himself told reporters : " I hope this criticism will disappear in the next few days . I oppose the establishment of an inquiry committee. " // The matter is expected to reach a crisis point at the Cabinet session Sunday . The liberal Shinui Party , which is represented in the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet agrees to a commission of inquiry at its meeting Sunday , Shinui will pull out of the coalition . This alone would not bring the Government down , but it would upset its delicate balance between pro-Labor and pro-Likud elements . <> <> Lawyers Appeal to Court // The two Tel Aviv lawyers - David Yiftah and Moshe Maroz - who appealed to the High Court of Justice today , against the President and Minister of Police Chaim Bar-Lev , argued that the amnesty was made without legal authority. // While the President has the right to give amnesty to criminals , the lawyers argued , this can only be done after the courts have completed their work and convicted someone - a process that was ignored in this case . The amnesty appears to have been given on the basis of political considerations , the lawyers contended . The court will announce shortly whether it will consider the lawyers ' appeal. // In another protest , Dedi Tzucker , a leader of the Citizens Rights Movement , announced that he was going to the President to request a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in criminal charges . " <> <> Public Opinion Shifts // Since the decision was announced , the mood of the Israeli public has undergone something of a shift - which apparently caught the Cabinet off guard . Since the revelations about the two Palestinians ' deaths came to light last month , the Israeli public has not seemed to be particularly exercised about the case. // But there has been a general discomfort about the charges that members of the security services lied and made it seem that a distinguished senior army officer , Brig . Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai , had been responsible for the deaths . General Mordechai interrogated the two bus hijackers before turning them over alive to Shin Beth. // " Much like Watergate , " said an Israeli political theorist , Shlomo Avineri , " the public is more upset about the cover-up and the idea that the rule of law is being subverted , than they are about the original crime. " // The normally right-of-center daily Hadashot said in an editorial that Cabinet ministers behaved like " a worried junta in a remote South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope from its neck. " // " There was Shamir , " Hadashot added , " who fought for his right like a lion not to be questioned or investigated . And there was Peres , who looked out on how his Government is sinking into a dung heap of miserable decisions and inadequacies . And the Attorney General was also there . That nice man who will do anything to please and was finally exposed as an empty vessel . How unfortunate that even the President joined in and turned his right of amnesty into a tool of politicians . This bunch does not represent the rule of law . They represent the use of law only in order to preserve themselves. " //
