Mile-long lines of patient first-time voters snaked toward polling booths under a broiling sun last week as Namibia held United Nations-supervised elections that will lead the territory to independence after 74 years of South African control . So great was the enthusiasm that more than 90% of the country 's 701,000 eligible voters cast ballots . <P> The leftist SWAPO Party , which led a guerrilla war against South Africa for 23 years , is expected to win a majority of the 72 seats in the National Assembly , but the key question will be the size of its victory . If SWAPO gains two-thirds of the seats , it will be able to frame the country 's new constitution on its own terms . But observers believed the voting procedures would limit SWAPO 's prospects . Example : since about half the voters were illiterate , many were likely to be confused by the fact that nine of the ten contending parties had ballot symbols that were similar to SWAPO 's clenched fist .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
