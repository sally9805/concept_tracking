Reed will go in April <P> Only a year ago , the Washington gossip was that Thomas Reed , the Special Assistant to the President , would go on to bigger things . A former Secretary of the Air Force under Presidents Ford and Carter , a longtime associate of President Reagan 's and a consultant to the National Security Council staff , Reed was thought to have had a good shot at a number of high-level openings down the road . No longer . Reed 's troubles go back to 1981 , when he made an investment of $3,000 in call options on shares of stock in the Amax mining company . When Standard Oil of California announced the next day that it hoped to buy Amax , Reed 's options appreciated to a net value of $427,000 . But Reed had spoken with his father , an Amax director , minutes before he purchased the options . The Securities and Exchange Commission began a probe that ended in formal accusations against Reed of illegal " insider trading , " charging that he had been tipped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously denied the allegations , but in December 1981 he signed an agreement with the SEC putting his profit in escrow pending the outcome of private litigation ; later he promised to donate the funds to charity . In January 1982 his old friend William Clark , President Reagan 's National Security Adviser , gave Reed his first consulting assignment . <P> That appointment now seems questionable . SEC documents obtained by Common Cause magazine and the CBS-TV show 60 Minutes revealed that Government investigators also learned that Reed had backdated the required brokerage forms and signed the names of two other people . Reed says that they and six others were to be the deal 's beneficiaries . The U.S. Attorney in New York has launched a " pre liminary investigation . " A House subcommittee is looking into why Clark appointed Reed to the sensitive NSC assignment , given Reed 's problems with the SEC , and a Senate subcommittee is investigating the SEC 's handling of the case . <P> Reed dismisses the entire flap as politically motivated . He says , " It 's the way Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should get out of the kitchen . " Last week Reed made preparations to do just that . When his current NSC assignment ends next month , he will leave the White House. - <P> * A stock call option allows the buyer to purchase a particular stock at a specified price during an agreed-upon interval .
