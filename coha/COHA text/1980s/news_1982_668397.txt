House Democrats are proposing a $5.4 billion package of assistance for the unemployed that includes emergency public works jobs , food and shelter . The new Democratic jobs proposal was to be added to a stopgap spending bill being drafted today by the House Appropriations Committee . A copy of the proposal was obtained by the Associated Press yesterday . The package would be in addition to President Ronald Reagan ' s proposed nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase , which is supposed to raise $5.5 billion to finance highway , bridge and mass transit repairs . That work was expected to create an estimated 170,000 construction jobs and another 150,000 jobs in related fields . Senate debate on the gasoline tax package , which already has passed the House after being proposed by Reagan , was delayed while Senate leaders tried to head off a threatened filibuster . In contrast to that bill , the new Democratic plan contains no revenue increases to pay for its provisions . There was no immediate estimate on how many additional jobs the Democratic plan would create , although aides have said previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300,000 jobs . Although Democratic leaders had touted their jobs bill for two weeks , aides said yesterday they were under orders not to discuss the new proposal publicly until after the Appropriations Committee had completed its work today . According to the advance copy , the legislation contains provisions rangingfrom $200,000 for the International Trade Administration to $1 billion for " emergency jobs creation " with priority to jobless people whose unemployment benefits have run out . The House passed a similar $1 billion temporary public works jobs bill shortly before Congress recessed for the fall elections , but the Senate rejected it . Another $1 billion would be earmarked for cities and urban counties to use in community development programs of their own choosing . Also included in the measure are a variety of housing assistance provisions . House Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr . had previously indicated that Democrats would try to draw up a package that would attract wide political support by offering something for almost everyone in Congress . The plan presented to the Appropriations Committee today includes : $232.4 million for job training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America " for the purpose of providing emergency food and shelter to needy individuals through private voluntary organizations . " $100 million to improve 205 highway bridges in the Northeast . $50 million to improve Veterans Administration facilities around the nation . $100 million to improve urban parks . $25 million " to improve and maintain forest roads , trails and other existing facilities ... " $50 million for " Indian health facilities . " $200 million for " rural water and waste disposal grants . " $95 million for improving state and federal prisons . In the Senate , meantime , Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr . ( R- Tenn. ) insisted yesterday that senators will approve the proposed increase in the current 4-cent federal gasoline tax despite a threatened filibuster . The House approved the measure early Tuesday , and the Senate Finance Committee followed suit Wednesday night . But both versions , in addition to the increased gasoline tax , contain higher truck levies that have sparked strong opposition from the trucking industry . " I don ' t know what kind of shape it ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes , Baker said . In addition to truckers , opponents of the measure include antitax groups opposed to the gas tax itself and environmentalists who object to construction of additional stretches of the federal interstate highway system .
