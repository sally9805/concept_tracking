New executions and purges <P> Their heads covered with ceremonial hoods , the four condemned prisoners were buried chest-deep in the earth just outside the town of Kerman in southern Iran . After the presiding Islamic judge had cast the first stone , five other people began pelting the hooded figures with rocks , some as large as oranges . The prisoners-two men accused of assorted sex crimes and two female prostitutes-took 15 minutes to die under the barbaric barrage . It was the first time in centuries that execution by stoning , a traditional Islamic punishment for certain sexual offenses , had been carried out in Iran . <P> The grim executions took place following renewed calls by Khomeini for a strict adherence to Islam and a purge of all forms of corruption . The 80-year-old Ayatullah had launched the campaign two weeks ago with an impassioned speech apologizing for the " incompetence " of his regime , which he said had " done nothing for the people .

Hundreds of civil servants and teachers who were accused of having ties with the former regime were purged from government offices and universities . <P> In other outbursts of moral fervor , Khomeini decreed that all women must now cover themselves with " proper Islamic dress , " and the Center for the Campaign Against Sin banned the sale of records and tapes of " vulgar music " from the West . The popularity of all these measures seems questionable : at week 's end only some 300,000 responded to official calls for a pro-Khomeini demonstration in Tehran . That was an embarrassingly low turnout , compared with the millions who regularly jammed the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <P> The regime also took steps against " foreign espionage " - and for once this did not refer to the 53 Americans held hostage since November . Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh announced the expulsion of a high-ranking Soviet diplomat accused of spying . He then ordered Moscow to reduce its diplomatic staff in Iran sharply and announced the closing of the Iranian consulate in Leningrad .
