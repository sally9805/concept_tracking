The battle that culminated last Friday with the rejection of Judge Bork by a vote of 58 to 42 was a bruising one that took a toll in personal relationships and political capital. // The outlook for the next round ( " Bork II " in Capitol Hill parlance ) depends of course in large measure on Mr. Reagan ' s choice of a nominee . But the landscape has been shaped by the first round , in ways that exert competing pulls on senators and on others who were deeply involved in the battle over Judge Bork. // For one thing , people are simply tired . There is little appetite on either side for having a battle that began in the early days of summer drag on into midwinter. // At the same time , there is a shared sense of having lived through a watershed event , one that for better or worse changed the rules of the game. // The conventional wisdom that greeted the Bork nomination no longer applies . Two expectations were shattered : that the Senate would take a basically passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approving earlier Reagan Administration nominees , and that questions about a nominee ' s philosophy and constitutional views were somehow off limits. // In past confirmation hearings , senators asked few questions , and received even fewer answers . But Judge Bork was questioned extensively and he answered fully in a five-day exchange that many senators believe set a standard from which there can now be no retreat . <> <> ' We Don ' t Want That Again ' // " I believe the world of Supreme Court nominations has changed , and for the better , " Senator Arlen Specter said in an interview today . The Pennsylvania Republican , a member of the Judiciary Committee , played a key role in Judge Bork ' s defeat. // But Senator Specter also said , " I ' ve got blood all over my head and shoulders " from assuming a role that some other Republicans viewed as treachery . The vote against Judge Bork was a difficult one for many senators , Democrats as well as Republicans , and some of the leading anti-Bork senators say they detect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover. // " It ' s easy to create a new political truth around here , " Senator Patrick J. Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , said today . " There are a lot of people who would like to begin a new political truth , namely ' We don ' t want to go through that again , ' so Bork II will zip through. " // But Senator Leahy said he thought that attitude would be short-lived if the next no 3/4inee proves to be a close replica of the last one. // " The initial reaction may be , ' Gee , maybe I can redeem myself with the right by rubber-stamping the next one , ' " he said . But he added : " It takes two minutes to realize that the one thing you can never redeem yourself from is a flip-flop . So many people in the country got so interested and so sensitized that they ' re not going to let their senators get away with not giving the next nominee a great deal of scrutiny. " // One Democratic Senate aide summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ways . Everyone is bruised and weary , but on the other hand , everyone is still suited up in their suit of lights . All the machinery is still in place. " // Senators who supported Judge Bork agree that the rules have changed , although they see the message as negative rather than positive. // " Regretfully , the landscape has been very much altered , " Senator Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota , who heads the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , said in an interview today . " The White House now has to screen a nominee not just for integrity and competence , but for confirmability . " <> <> Tremors From Wall Street // Not every change in the landscape is the result of the Bork confirmation battle . The Senate has been handed a wild card in the form of last week ' s stock market crash and the mood of economic uncertainty that has suddenly gripped the country. // The relationship between Wall Street ' s tailspin and the Supreme Court may appear elusive at best . But senators survive by keeping their an-tennas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several speculated today that the financial crisis could strengthen Mr. Reagan ' s hand in filling the Supreme Court vacancy. // " When Bork was the only issue , everyone had to take a position , " Senator Dave Durenberger , a Minnesota Republican who supported Judge Bork , said in an interview . " In my state this summer , there was no other issue . Now people are worried about their jobs , their futures . A senator can be justified in saying , ' Hey , I can ' t worry about the Court , I ' m dealing with the deficit. ' " // " Things shift quickly in this place , and the Supreme Court has become a subsidiary issue , " Senator William S. Cohen , a Maine Republican who voted for Judge Bork , said with a shrug as he left a lunch of Republican senators at which the economy was virtually the only topic . <> <> Reason for Delay // But others suggest that the financial crisis could have another spin entirely , enabling the Democrats , if they have doubts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court vacancy until next year . " Because the Court is not as high a priority now as it was last month , the country wouldn ' t blame the Democrats for taking their time and trying to deal with the budget first , " one key liberal lobbyist said. // Senator Specter said he thought the sense of economic crisis might help the President temporarily , but not in the long run if the next nominee proved offensive to many of those who fought Judge Bork. // " The mood in this chamber , the city , and the country is a sober mood , almost somber , after what ' s happened on Wall Street , " Senator Specter said . " The overriding feeling is that the country ' s business needs to be tended to , that we have to save our energies for the budget , that we don ' t have the luxury of another battle over the Court. " // " But , " he added quickly , " if another battle is necessary , there will be no timidity about fighting it. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
