 | They definitely are not down and out in Beverly Hills or nearby Hollywood . The movie business is flourishing as the once dreaded videocassette recorder transforms celluloid into gold and helps bring major changes to the industry . Among the most significant developments now occurring Independent film makers are becoming a greater force than in the past , distributing more U.S.-made movies than the major studios . The studios are battling to keep soaring costs under control and are taking increasingly bold steps into related businesses . Marketing considerations , a big part of the industry for over a decade , are becoming dominant . Advertising budgets often match the sums poured into actually making a film . For the first time in history , boxoffice revenue is taking second place to income from cassette sales . The cassette market has spurred an increase in the number of films . Last year , 453 feature films were released in the U.S. , compared with 330 in 1982 . All of this means that whether you are a Rambo fanatic or prefer the more intellectual style of Ingmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films more quickly and easily than ever . Independents vs. studios No segment of the industry has benefited more from the changes than independents , who produce everything from low-grade horror flicks to such critically acclaimed movies as " Kiss of the Spider Woman " and " The Trip to Bountiful , " which have six Oscar nominations between them . Now , independents , who used to find it difficult to get production funds , can raise money by preselling VCR and foreign rights . Producer Carolyn Pfeiffer did that to come up with 80 percent of the $2.8 million budget for her new film , " Trouble in Mind . " An indication of the independents ' growth : In 1970 , they distributed only 89 U.S.-made films , compared with 207 for the major studios . Last year , according to Variety , their output was 141 , while the studios put out 135 . " Hollywood is expanding , burgeoning in many different directions , " says Bram Goldsmith , chairman of City National Bank in Beverly Hills , which finances independent movies . Setting independents apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They generally make movies in the $2-million-to-$5-million range . By contrast , the major studios spent an average of $16.8 million on each film last year , 79 percent more than in 1980 . " Costs are totally ridiculous , " says Sidney Sheinberg , president of MCA , the parent company of Universal Pictures . " We must get a better handle on making films less expensively . " In the studio system , moviemaking sometimes takes a back seat to deal making . Studios frequently have bloated payrolls and throw money away by rewriting scripts several times . They also give whopping salaries to big stars who do n't always lure big crowds . Pfeiffer says that she can " make three films for what Robert Redford was paid for Out of Africa . ' " He received an estimated $6 million . Yoram Globus , president of the Cannon Group , the largest independent , says that given his firm 's average budget of $5 million a film , " if somebody is losing money , he is an idiot . " Most independents cut costs by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they do hire big names , they sometimes  | get them at bargain prices . Producer and director Bud Yorkin recently persuaded Ann-Margret , Gene Hackman and Ellen Burstyn to work for 50 percent of their regular fee in exchange for a share of the profits from " Twice in a Lifetime . " Yorkin says , " They did three weeks of rehearsal for nothing . " Many stars are hesitant to make similar deals with the studios because studio bookkeeping can turn a profitable film into one that oozes red ink . Agent Sam Adams recalls one film that cost $5.5 million to make , grossed $29 million and showed a loss of $250,000 . Marketing to the fore To try to assure boxoffice success , studios pay more attention to marketing . Last year , they spent an average of $7.2 million to sell each film , compared with just $4.3 million in 1980 . Sometimes the marketing tab exceeds the cost of the picture itself . Paul Kagan , publisher of the Motion Picture Investor newsletter , says " Police Academy 2 " cost $8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Gould , who cofinanced such films as " Flashdance , " calls marketing " the voice consulted prior to production . You ask what 's the marketing hook to get people out of their living rooms and into the theater . " Many studios stress films with themes they can get across in a 30-second TV commercial . Andrew Fogelson , marketing head for United Artists , says most movies fall into two categories : Those whose cast and title are self-descriptive , like " Police Academy 2 , " and those that by cast and title say nothing , like " The Color Purple . " Today , Hollywood is making more films in the first category . In a business where the entrance to the executive suite is often a revolving door , doing a sequel is a safe way for nervous executives to play the game . At the same time , executives who were badly burned by the failure of teen films last summer show growing interest in movies aimed at more mature audiences . They have been spurred to take a few risks by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Choosing between sequelmania and more sophisticated films encapsulates the perpetual Hollywood dilemma : To opt for a formula or to latch onto the latest trend . Regardless of which they choose , studios try to determine a film 's appeal to demographic groups by holding screenings . The reaction often shapes marketing plans and can even alter a film 's content , with a character whom the audience finds unappealing left on the cutting-room floor . Exhibition strategy is key to marketing . Opening in 1,000 theaters combined with a TV ad blitz is favored for films thought to have mass appeal . A more conservative method is preferred for higher-brow productions such as " The Color Purple . " That film was initially shown in just one theater in most cities , coupled with a subdued ad campaign featuring the silhouette of a black woman in a rocking chair . " Word of mouth and good reviews are the best advertising , " says Sanford Reisenbach , president of worldwide advertising-publicity for Warner Bros . Cassettes vs. theaters While network TV , cable and pay cable have each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none has proved as significant as the videocassette . Analyst Paul Kagan estimates Hollywood will earn $2.3 billion from U.S. cassette sales this year , $600 million more than the box-office take . The rise of the VCR has come with astonishing speed . In 1980 , domestic video accounted for only 7 percent of the featurefilm industry 's revenues . It will reach 34 percent this year , says Kagan . Almost singlehandedly , VCR 's are expected to raise Hollywood 's revenues by 25 percent in 1986 . " Without the cassette , it would be bankruptcy time for some studios , " says Harold Vogel , a Merrill Lynch analyst . Increasingly , money from video and other nontheatrical rights helps launch film projects . Some low-budget pictures are even being produced exclusively for cassettes . A film that does poorly at the box office is now taken off the screens and put on cassette within months . While cassette revenues can not turn a bomb into a bonanza , they can ease the pain . " Birdy , " which drew less than $1 million at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As more people own VCR 's and cassette prices come down , the potential market will grow substantially . " Some people think the sell-through part of the business will overtake the rental market , " says James Fifield , president of CBS/Fox , a major video company . The studios ' main complaint is that , by law , they get income only from the sale of a cassette , not from subsequent rentals . Studios have failed to get Congress to pass legislation to remedy this . Though cassettes have proved a vital asset , they also have a downside . " There is no question that they are eating into movie attendance , " says Vogel . The Newspaper Advertising Bureau found that 32 percent of people who went to movies at least once a month attended less often after they got a VCR . Last year , theater admissions , which had been stagnant for two decades , dipped almost 12 percent . Some movie-industry insiders point to a poor crop of pictures . But independent producer and distributor Samuel Goldwyn , Jr. , says now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at home . Also affecting moviegoing is the condition of many theaters . The number of  | screens is growing , but often they are quite small . What is needed , say many studio executives , are new sound systems and bigger screens to make moviegoing more of an event . " Some 90 percent of theaters do n't show the medium to its potential , " says Jim Kessler , general manager of the theater-operations division of Lucasfilm , Ltd . Yet theaters remain crucial to the industry . They determine the final value of a film on cassettes and elsewhere . " The lifeblood of the business is still the audience watching films in the theater , " says producer Leonard Goldberg . Another concern is that the VCR wave could ebb in 1990 as sales of recorders diminish and people tire of their new toy . This could come at the same time that a glut of video titles puts a damper on the industry . Many executives say that is happening already . Lee Isgur , an analyst for PaineWebber , says that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Do n't worry , guys , whatever happens we 'll cover 30 to 45 percent of production costs with home video . ' But there are going to be a lot of losses when things hit the fan . " After the VCR , what ? Many analysts see the industry 's salvation in finding another cash cow to milk if the cassette market wanes . The syndication market is mooing softly . The studios already gain a large portion of their revenues from syndicating TV series they produce . Now , with the growth of independent TV stations , demand for syndicated film packages is increasing . Foreign video sales also are expected to provide more revenue . But all of Hollywood is hoping that these will pale in comparison with the riches from pay-per-view , which enables people to dial a number and order any one of several titles for showing on their home screens almost immediately . The films could be delivered by cable or satellite , with the cost billed to a credit card . Skeptics doubt pay-per-view has the potential Hollywood dreams about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay-per-view , if that does not violate antitrust laws . " It 's important that the movie industry control its destiny so we own part of the new technology instead of always being the middleman , " says Ashley Boone , marketing head for Lorimar Motion Pictures . Such sentiment grows out of the recent experience with Home Box Office , a pay-cable company that became a powerful force in the business and tried to dictate to the studios . Though HBO is still a major player , its clout has been blunted by a leveling off of subscribers and a shift by some viewers to cassette . The studios are taking steps to gain greater control over their economic fate by owning both the product in the entertainment pipeline and the pipeline itself . Multimedia entrepreneur Rupert Murdoch owns Twentieth Century-Fox and is buying the six Metromedia TV stations , which will serve as an outlet for both Fox 's film and TV products . Viacom , a company with roots in TV , recently bought 16 percent of Orion Pictures . As soon as Ted Turner completes his acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot in the movie business and the other in a distribution channel , television . MCA also will have a foot in both camps . On February 18 , it announced the purchase of WOR-TV in New York . Both MCA and Columbia Pictures have purchased interests in theater chains , too . Executives say other studios would like to get into the theater business if they can avoid running up against a 3-decade-old Justice Department antitrust agreement prohibiting them from theater ownership . Eventually , studios may get into video retailing . " What 's the difference between owning theaters and owning stores ? " asks Frank Mancuso , chairman of Paramount Pictures . " Both are systems for delivering the product . " The only thing that seems certain is continued flux that will affect every segment of Hollywood . Says Samuel Goldwyn , Jr. : " We live in an industry where change is the nature of the business . Just when you think you understand things , they shift again . "                @ @ @ @ @
