The curtain is down on the summer 's Iran-contra drama , and Ronald Reagan is getting ready for his final 17-month run in Washington , which could be a corker . In the Oval Office last week for an interview with TIME , he looked healthier and more vigorous than recent press accounts have portrayed him . Yet he has been burned and battered by events and people , and his caution was like armor  --  a shield that every modern President adopts eventually , no matter what vows he makes about open communion to the end . " There 's always a target painted on the Chief Executive 's door , " he says . <P> In a few hours Reagan would speak to the nation about his Administration 's great scandal and would harvest yet more criticism . " The fact of the matter is that there 's nothing I can say that will make the situation right , " he would say later , in a statement that was both apologetic and defiant . " I was stubborn in my pursuit of a policy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither friends nor enemies . But it was one that was inside the President as simple and pure as a diamond and had to come out , audience acceptance or not . " Well , " he told TIME earlier in the day , his nose still scarred and red from his skin-cancer operation , " I 'll be sitting at the same desk , so I can always duck . " <P> But when the time came for the speech Reagan did n't duck , and wo n't . He let the critics take their shots : " The old Reagan magic , the energy and passion are gone , " said the dyspeptic conservative Richard Viguerie . " He should have had Ollie North write his speech , but instead he was on the defensive . " Democrats just shook their heads over the scandal 's unresolved issues and condemned a misguided Chief Executive . Rebutted Maine 's Senator George Mitchell : " Let there be no misunderstanding . The mistakes were not only in the execution of policies . The major mistakes were in the policies themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-month Iran-contra ordeal , one had the feeling that nothing had changed , yet everything was different . He remains stubborn and unbowed and believing and upbeat ; he refuses to hold a grudge . The essence of his talk in the afternoon light of the Oval Office was that a foreign policy operation , born of the best of intentions , went wrong . But the damage , he is certain , will fade . Reagan is calling for the nation to forget and move into the future . Details be damned ; unanswered questions be hanged . The great congressional inquisition is finished . Does that mean it is all over ? Yes , says Reagan , " as far as the audience is concerned . " And Reagan has read the American audience better than any other politician of this decade .
