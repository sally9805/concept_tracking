But the concept reaches what may be its highest level in Theatreworks USA - a superlative family-oriented theater company that has an Off Broadway home here in New York and also tours the United States , playing in schools and theaters. // Theatreworks productions are professional , highly entertaining , and never condescending . Behind all the fun , they project a sense of strong values . The plays seem to appeal to every age , from three on up to adults. // // Even the smallest children sat spellbound at a play I attended , titled ' ' Lady Liberty , ' ' about the far-from-childish subject of immigrant life in America . The usual restless chatter and loud outbursts were practically absent from these performances ; and there was enough meat to keep the older children and even the adults interested . In fact , quite a few adults came without children. // ' ' Lady Liberty ' ' is the tale of a young Slovak girl , Maria , who comes to America innocently believing she will find a brand new life right off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brave hope that survives phases of discouragement , struggle , and even outrage , as Maria and her friends come up against one barrier after another. // Finally , their renewed determination results in an idea to start a business of their own - the message being that a right idea put into practice can overcome even the most stubborn obstacles . This message was charmingly conveyed in a song entitled ' ' It ' s the Thought That Counts. ' ' // By sending out several troupes at a time , Theatreworks USA manages to give more than 1 , 000 performances a year , reaching about 800 , 000 people , mostly in schools around the US. // The plays feature fresh-faced , dynamic , talented actors - all adults - and are written by first-rate writers . There are usually five or six actors and actresses in each production , and the company employs about 100 actors and stagehands in the course of a year. // The staging is simple but imaginative , and the music and lyrics are inventive and witty. // In an interview at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group ' s artistic director , explained , ' ' We commission all the works that we do . We get the best authors , composers , lyricists available to us. ' ' // Among these are Ossie Davis , Thomas Babe , Saul Levitt , Mary Rodgers , Joe Raposo , Albert Hague , John Morris , Alice Childress , and Gary William Friedman. // Charles Hull , managing director , added , ' ' We ' ve had some terrific actors through the years . Henry Winkler was in our Bible stories . Sherman Hemsley was in a play about Martin Luther King . Last year we had our first Academy Award winner , F. Murray Abraham. ' ' // Mr. Harnick became interested in theater for young audiences in 1961 when he directed a play titled ' ' Young Abe Lincoln. ' ' // It was the first musical for young people to play on Broadway . Soon Harnick joined producer Robert K. Adams to form Harnick-Adams Productions . The two men worked together for a number of years , developing more material and touring. // Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precursor of Theatreworks USA , was born. // Mr. Hull explained , ' ' Over the years we developed over 30 shows , many of them histories or biographies , some of them story-theater - Hans Christian Andersen , Grimm ' s stories , and Bible stories. ' ' // Many of the plays are biographical , in keeping with the ' ' Young Abe ' ' precedent . These are popular , especially in schools. // ' ' We come out of a long history of touring the schools , ' ' said Hull . ' ' The administrators see it as a way of having something good , something theatrical in their school , and yet being able to justify it , because it does tie into the curriculum. ' ' // Says a school official from Highland Springs , Va . , ' ' After eight years of booking productions into the school system , K through 12 , I feel that I have finally found a company that holds to our standards of artistic quality . The quality is evident in the performance , style , visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educate through entertainment. ' ' // ' ' When the Cookie Crumbles , You Can Still Pick Up the Pieces ' ' is a right-to-the-point musical revue about divorce . ' ' There have been a lot of kids plays written about divorce , ' ' Hull said , ' ' but it ' s a tough proposition to tackle that subject and make it say something honestly and yet be entertaining . So Jay suggested that we use the revue format - songs , skits , and so on. ' ' // ' ' We were trying to create a show that would offer support to kids , ' ' said Harnick , ' ' one that says that if we talk about it , it ' s better than not talking about it . And although divorce is a traumatic experience , life goes on , and there ' s a way of picking yourself up and dealing with it. ' ' // One little girl from the Bronx who saw ' ' Cookie ' ' wrote a letter to Theatreworks , stating , ' ' When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I told my friend sitting next to me , that ' s what I ' m going through. ' ' // ' ' We don ' t produce the plays with the idea of promoting any particular ideology or point of view , ' ' added Hull , ' ' or even to tell kids to work harder or be nice to your mother or listen to your teacher. // ' ' We really approach it as theater people . We have to come up with terrific entertainment - that ' s what theater is all about , and hopefully it says something along the way. ' ' // For some time both he and Harnick had been hoping for a permanent residence for the company in New York . Happily that dream came true last year , when the group took up permanent residence at the Promenade Theater here . Plays for Theatreworks ' 1986-87 New York season ( though Feb. 22 ) include ' ' Lady Liberty , ' ' ' ' Merlin , ' ' ' ' The Emperor ' s New Clothes , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Sherlock Holmes and the Red-Headed League.
