as far as Cripplegate before collapsing from sheer exhaustion ) . Then God had brought him into Smithfield itself , where in the same concatenation of preordained events Gabriel had met Simon Plover and then the pig-woman 's girl , Rose Dibble , a plain , simple soul with whom Gabriel had shared , at least in part , the burden of his divine appointment . He had told her what he thought prudent . For her good as well as his . And so it would be until he had put her faith to an appropriate test . Simon Plover had been blind , stumbling drunk , smelling of bear and beer , groping his way along walls and fences  --  a shrunken soul already damned for its impieties in a young but wasted body . The meeting between Gabriel and the bearward 's helper had been quite accidental , or so it had seemed at the time . Gabriel had picked the poor wretch literally out of the gutter , listened to him babble about his employers and the stinking monster he had the charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was obviously , drunk or sober , too craven to do it . Unless he was given one leg up for the enterprise . Gabriel provided the aid , finished Plover quickly . It was more an execution than otherwise , and the truth was that Gabriel felt no guilt at all and , indeed , had very little memory of the deed . It had all been done quickly . Death , the disposing of the body  --  all over very quickly , like the fillip of finger and thumb . Because already Gabriel was looking beyond the death of Plover to something of more far-reaching significance.  |p51Arrived  in London , the Chelmsford constable and his wife found lodgings at the Hand and Shears , a spacious , comfortable inn convenient to the fair and much patronized by clothiers and drapers , as the inn 's name suggested . Here they slept very restlessly despite their weariness from travel , for there was a continual racket on the stairs , a child wailed all night in the next chamber , and before the first light of day the hostlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their horses , coming and going and making a great noise about it . The Stocks rose early , therefore , since there was no quiet to be had , breakfasted , then set out for the Priory Close , where Matthew 's wares had been taken upon their arrival and where they had since been put on display along with the goods of other of England 's clothiers . Although the fair would not officially begin for another day , Smithfield was already swarming with peddlers , small dealers , victuallers , showmen , tradesmen of every sort , and a good number of the general public who had been drawn there for the mere sight of it all . Along with them had come less desirable folk  --  rogues , vagabonds , whores , cutpurses , common thieves , roisterers , and the like  --  men and women and some children as well , without visible means of support but with a quick eye for opportunity and for the gullibility of the innocent and honest . These stood around in conspicuous idleness , while the reputabletradespeople put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or gossiped with neighbors and renewed old acquaintances , or cc nplained about the high rents for stallagethis particular year . Chelmsford had of course its own fair , as did every largerp52town in England , but Joan had never seen anything like this . The booths , Joan observed as she passed , were very colorful but flimsily built structures , made of poles and painted canvas , old boards , barrels , and tree limbs . Some were covered with branches or thatching to protect from sun or rain ; others were roofless and amounted to no more than simple partitions with bare planks for counters and crudely lettered signs announcing to the illiterate what could be had there . All was designed to be put up and taken down with dispatch , to fit where there was little room , and to accrue the least expense to the booth 's owner , who was out to make money at BartholomewFair , not to waste it in costly construction . The more elaborate of the booths had insides and out . The front part of the booth displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front by a flap of canvas or cloth , were for storage or temporary living quarters for the tradesman , who found it wise not to leave his valuable stock unwatched during the night . Sellers of drink and food who were in a prosperous way providedtables and benches for their patrons . Victuallers of more modest means were content to hawk from pushcart or barrel or basket . All about , showmen  --  and there were a great company of them  --  could be seen honing their skills . Jugglers , magicians , singers , acrobats  --  from all over England . And with the showmenwere the monsters of Smithfield : the calf with five legs , the woman with beard , and a bull with a great pizzle , which had been shown in many a fair and was regarded a favorite attraction . Joan also saw a puppeteer , entertaining a handful of children , and thought of the poor fellow that was murdered . But the greatest impression forced on her was no sight but the stink ! It was perfectly horrid , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maze of booths before she commented on it . It was indeed strong enough to cause the nostrils to burn . " It 's the cattle , " Matthew explained , looking around him and obviously taking delight in what he saw . " The horse and hay market of Smithfield is famous . The stench is the price that is paid for it . Never fear , your nose will grow used to it . "  |p53But  Joan doubted her nose would . Her good wife 's nose , an instrument of great sensitivity and discernment , was superior to that of her husband , but she said no more about the smell . As for sights , there were almost more here than she could take in . She marveled that her husband knew where he was going . She had lost her own sense of direction completely . Did the inn lay that way or this ? All was twistings and turnings . The booths had been set out in lanes , but none was straighter than the permanent alleys and streets of the neighborhood . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared boldly at her as though she were some wonder herself fit to be shown there . Was there something odd about her appearance , her dress , she wondered ? Or was it simply that they were unaccustomed to the sight of a well-dressed woman of the rising middle class , astride with her husband , also of a prosperous sort , amid the booths before the fair began ? Joan decided she did not like Smithfield nor its great fair , despite its fame and dissolute glamor . She was no " BartholomewBird , " as she had heard the denizens of Smithfield called ; and she could not forgive the noxious odor of the place , no matter what her husband might say in mitigation . In the Priory Close were permanent booths rented to the clothiers during fair time and kept in good repair . This spacious yard , surrounded on three sides by walls of good height and on the fourth by the Priory of St. Bartholomew itself , had the advantage of greater cleanliness and a measure of security during the night , for the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There , Matthew found his goods , already set out by his assistant , Peter Bench . Peter was reading a book and hardly noticed his master 's approach . Matthew greeted his assistant heartily . " A very good day , Mr. Stock and Mrs. Stock ! " said Peter . " All in good order , I see , " said Matthew , casting an appreciativeeye over his samples . " Oh , it 's been very quiet here , sir , " said Peter . " It will be a different story , tomorrow , " said Matthew.  | " Let 's pray it will , " said Joan , " or we have all come to Smithfield for nothing . " " Hardly for nothing , " Matthew said . " There 's the fair . Also Ned Babcock . " Bartholomew Fair . Ned Babcock . Joan did not care at all for the first ; would she like the second ? She hardly remembered the man  --  or boy , as he was those many years before . The image of a thin boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then slipped away , as old memories did . Had that vanishing figure of her imagination been Ned Babcock or some other among her early acquaintances ? Well , he was Matthew 's boyhood friend , and she supposed that should be enough for her . " We are to meet Ned at the bear pit , " Matthew announced after a few more words with Peter . " Peter , you may return to your book . A collection of poems , is it ? " Peter said that it was . He had bought it at a stall near Paul 's churchyard and was pleased with the contents . " Well , read on , " said Matthew , in very good humor . On their way to the bear pit , Matthew spoke warmly of Ned Babcock . " A most generous and able fellow , I tell you , Joan , despite an almost constant stream of ill luck . We were schoolfellows , you know . He was an apprentice to my father 's cousin , Jacob Symmington , a tailor . He forsook the craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookseller , lost all in a fire , then by turns was bricklayer , carpenter , and at length , his father 's heir . Was well-to-do but lost all again in foolish investments . " " And now he baits the bears in Southwark , " Joan remarked , ironically . " A recent adventure , with capital he secured from several old creditors upon promise to spend wisely and repay twice the sum he originally borrowed , with his father 's land in Essex as security . His partner 's name is Francis Crisp . I do n't know the man , but Ned speaks well of him . " " I think I shall meet both soon , " Joan said , seeing the bear pit ahead . A large sign dangling from a newly erected post read :  |p55SMITHFIELD  BEAR GARDENS , BABCOCK AND CRISP , PROPRIETORS . Depicted on the sign was a bear rampant , paws in the air . This , she presumed , was the legendary Samson , about whom her husband had spoken on another occasion . Already her fastidious housewife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unpleasant odor yet . Bear Gardens , indeed ! A handsome young man with a limp was standing before the bear pit entrance , watching the people pass . He told the Stocks where his employers , Babcock and Crisp , could be found . FrancisCrisp was standing in the pit proper , tossing apples to a bear . The bear was catching the apples in his mouth and eating them greedily . Crisp paused when he became aware of the Stocks and said , " No baiting today , if you 've come for that . Return tomorrow . The first baiting is at three o'clock . " Her husband explained that they had not come for the baitingbut to see Ned Babcock , his old friend . " So you 're Matthew Stock of Chelmsford ! " cried Crisp , wrinklinghis face into a smile . " As I hope to be saved , Ned will be right pleased to know you 've come . Now where is the man ? By the Mass , he 's around here someplace . " Crisp extended a sinewy , brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome to Smithfield and its bear garden , " Crisp said . Joan stared at the bear with fascination . She had seen many bears  --  bears dancing , begging , decked out in funny hats or coats . The English loved them . But she had never seen a bear such as this . The shaggy creature was very large , with a massive , sloping forehead and huge snout ; its paws were powerfullookingand threatening . She watched as it greedily gobbled up the last of the apples and then looked inquiringly at Crisp as though to ask if there were n't more . She noticed the bear had many an old wound on its mangy coat . He was well named , the bear . Samson , terror of dogs  --  and perhaps men too ? A man now came out of the tent that could be seen at the other end of the pit , shaded his eyes , and helloed.  | " Ned ! " cried Matthew , as the large , ruddy-faced man came toward them , his arms open in a gesture of welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know , talking very fast and with many gestures . And what did they think of Smithfield ? Was it not very fine , despite the August heat , the dust , and the stink ? Joan allowed Matthew to answer these questions , and felt somewhat excluded from the reunion . " He 's not Harry Hunks or Sackerson , " said Babcock , referringto two of the most famous of London 's fighting bears , " yet he 's a stout fellow iin combat , I assure you . " This stout fellow , having evidently concluded that there were no more apples to be had , was now resting his head on his forepaws and staring listlessly at his masters and their guests . In this posture , the bear resembled a large shaggy dog in the grip of unspeakableboredom , but Babcock was still going on about the bear 's valor . " There 's many have paid three pence or more to see Samson at work and not complained afterward of the cost . He 's long in the tooth now , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis Crisp , Joan noticed , said little . She thought him a queer little man , shabbily dressed in contrast to his partner , and smelling of the bear . Although friendly and outgoing before , he seemed in his partner 's presence to become somewhat moody and quiet , as though all the verbal energy available was used up by Babcock , whenever the larger and younger man was around . Babcock asked them if they would n't like a tour of the pit . It was something to see , he assured them . His enthusiasm made clear this was not an invitation to be refused . " This hour tomorrow , the fair begun , these benches will be full , " said Babcock as they walked the length of the pit and came to the tent . " In three days ' time I 'll be free of debt and a new man . " Babcock smiled optimistically . " Feeding Samson must be a great expense , " Joan remarked as Babcock led them inside the dark , foul-smelling den . She saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a prison . Its floor was strewn with straw , atop of which could be seen the remains of the bear 's last meal  --  a cluster of bloody bones and gristle.  |p57Noticing  that Joan had taken an interest in the cage , Babcockdescribed Samson 's diet . The bear ate great quantities of meat had from the city butchers at little cost since most of it was scrap , he said . Samson also was fond of good English beer , although the animal was provided with this treat sparingly so as not to form an expensive habit . Babcock told a story about one bear who so came to prefer the beverage that he refused thereafterto drink water . Matthew laughed at the story . " I wonder that any hound lives who would dare fight with such a creature , " he said . Joan agreed . " Oh , you 'd be amazed , " Babcock said . " A strong-hearted mastiff will sink his teeth in and hold ' til his very body is stripped raw of fur . I 've seen it myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little spaniel named Twit . No bigger than a house cat . He bit half through Samson 's foot before he bled to death himself . What a pity . I had to cut the spaniel 's teeth off Samson . It took a month for the wound to heal properly . On your way outdoors you can see for yourself . A very ugly scar . " Joan said she would put off examining the scar for another visit . Babcock continued on about Samson 's prowess and his hopes that his new business venture would both clear his debts and make him and Crisp wealthy . " If Samson does n't bring in the coppers this fair time , then I do n't know my head from my hand . Why , every farmer and goatherd will want to match their favorite dog or bitch against him . But they will be sorely disappointed , I promise you , for Samson will send them that live whimpering home soon enough . " It was very hot inside the tent , and having viewed Samson 's cage there was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh straw and , in a corner , a kind of rude pallet , with a patched blanket covering it . Babcock led them out , still jabberingabout the bear , with Crisp nodding his head in wordless approval of all his partner said . Joan got the idea that Samson was only the most recent of Babcock 's enthusiasms . He talkedp58like a successful man , and had Matthew not acquainted her with the sad tale of his failures , Joan would probably have taken his boasting at face value . But what did it all amount to really , this investment in a bear that did battle with dogs ? It did not seem to her an entirely honest way of life . Matthew thanked the bearwards for the tour and promised to return the next day for the first of the baitings . Joan had earlier agreed to keep Matthew company . Matthew planned to attend for friendship 's sake ; Joan , for Matthew 's sake . Neither cared for bearbaitings , although neither had seen one . Then Babcock invited them to take supper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he declared , with particular emphasis on the word investors . " And my daughter , Juliet . " " She that was recently widowed ? " Matthew inquired . For once the round-faced , ebullient man frowned ; but it was not a face for frowning , and the stern regard soon faded . " The very one . A most unfortunate girl . Somewhat melancholy , and for very good reason . The story of her husband 's untimely death is a sad one , but I 'll save it for another day . " They said their farewells to the two partners and , passing out through the entrance booth , Matthew announced he would spend the afternoon in the Close , for he planned to show his wares to certain London tailors with whom he hoped eventually to do some business . He asked Joan if she would come too , but she declined . She had had enough for the morning of men and their doings and was badly in need of fresher air . If such could be had in Smithfield . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Matthew at the Hand and Shears at five o'clock . Matthew walked off toward the Priory . Joan paused , decided which way to go . Then she saw the young man she had observedupon entering , the bearward 's helper . He was coming up the lane , pushing the wheelbarrow that was now empty of its odoriferous contents . He was almost to her when he stopped to talk to a slim , dark-haired girl , who had come out of one of the booths to meet him . Joan paused to observe this pleasant view of youthful court/ship . If there was ever love written upon a face , love was writtenupon the girl 's . The young man 's handsome features seemed equally affected . Joan was at too great a distance to hear their conversation , but she guessed its import . What a handsome couple they made ! He with his shock of blond hair and wellformedshoulders ; she with her fresh cheeks , slender form , and innocent gaze . The faces of both were bright with blushing . Joan was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immense girth and slovenly appearance came rushing from the booth and snatched the girl by the hair , jerking her head back with a snap . She started to beat the girl with her fists , pounding her on the shoulders and back , cursing loudly . The bearward 's helper tried to separate the two but failed . He was struck himself by the terrible woman and was sent sprawlingin the dirt . Another man appeared from a neighboring booth and said something that appeased the large woman 's wrath ; while she scolded the girl , the boy limped off sorrowfully , nursing his jaw . Joan felt profoundly sorry for the girl , who she now realized must be the servant of the terrible fat woman . By law , employers were allowed to beat their servants . Custom also sanctioned it . Masters could beat their servants , their apprentices , their children , even their wives . As long as the damage was within limits , no blame was attached to the beater . But Joan had her own ideas about that ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , nor on an apprentice or a child ( although there were more than a handful of scoundrels of both sexes in Chelmsford she would have gladly pummelled , yes , and felt no guilt at it either ! ) . The young man came toward Joan , passing without remark . Joan thought to catch his eye , to offer some cheerful word of encouragement or consolation , but the young man 's head was down , his stare fixed on the trace of muck in the wheelbarrow as though he were studying some awful revenge upon the vicious slattern who had assaulted him . And who could blame him ? Joan thought , as the bearward 's helper hobbled past her.  |p60Still  shaken from the violent scene she had witnessed , Joan wandered down a lane of half-erected booths , latecomers to Smithfield , steering clear of the bustle of construction . She stopped to watch a juggler keep five balls aloft while he pranced around in a circle . Paused again to survey the goods of a toy seller , wondering if her little grandson would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The heat of noon had lived up to the promise of the morning . The aroma of roasting pork mixed with less savory smells . She felt woozy and her throat was dry . She would resist the temptation of Bartholomew pig as greasy and fattening , but how she needed something cool to drink . " A bottle of ale to quench you in these dog days ? " cried a voice at hand . A little man , as ugly as a toad , thrust the bottle at her , grinning from ear to ear . She paid for the bottle , opened the stopple , and drank . The ale was tepid and tasteless and she would have complained of it , but when she turned around the tapster had disappeared . Realizing that last night 's sleeplessness was beginning to tell on her , she resolved to go to the inn without further delay . She looked around her to get her bearings , and was about to proceedin what she hoped was the correct direction when she saw at the end of the lane a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent was set off by itself and on its sides were painted crude representations of moon , stars , and sun . A placard set up beside the tent displayed a large open palm with short , stubby fingers , such as a child might draw . The lines of the palm were dark and wide and there were strange symbols imprinted on the fingers , the ball of the thumb , and the flat of the hand.  |p61Joan  was sure this was the habitation of an astrologer or fortune-teller . She knew that there were many in London , most Gypsies living in Cow-lane and many famous for their prognostications , horoscopes , and palm readings . Of these practitionersof hidden arts ( not witches ; they were another matter ) , Joan had no settled conviction . Her mind was open , for did not the Queen of England herself consult her own private sorcerer and astrologer , the illustrious Doctor Dee ? And did not many lesser lights , men of breeding and education too , regard their prophesies with respect ? Joan had known many a cunningwomanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gifts . But she had never consulted them . She herself had gifts , glimmerings , as she called them , visions that came unbidden , visions that warned , consoled , informed as her need was and that she did not construe as incompatible with true religion or common sense and that had more than once saved her life  --  and Matthew 's too . As for the influence heavenly bodies might exert on the destiny of men , who knew how some vaguely perceivedconstellation , twinkling weakly in the night , might mirroran inherent quality in man , disposing him to one fate rather than another ? Her curiosity was strong , and it drew her even closer to the tent . She forgot the heat and her wooziness . The tent flap was closed ; and the tent seemed unoccupied . Now she observed that beneath the crudely depicted palm a word was written . Esmera . What did it mean ? A name perhaps ? She tried to imagine what manner of person Esmera might be and was still doing so when she became aware of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then heard a voice . " Stay , mistress , I pray you ! " The tent flap was still closed , but Joan was sure the appeal was addressed to her , and even if it had not been she would have obeyed for the words were spoken with such urgency and in such a strange voice that she felt compelled to stand where she was.  |p62The  tent flap was suddenly swept aside by a dark , bejeweled hand , and the owner of the beckoning voice showed herself . The woman 's appearance , for woman it was , was striking . She was either the homeliest woman Joan had ever seen or the most beautiful . Tall and regally thin , garbed in a long scarlet robe that stretched from shoulder to feet , Esmera had a high forehead crowned with long , straight black hair that fell to her shoulders , dark , moist eyes , the nose of a Roman empress , and very full pale lips in odd contrast to her skin color . If beauty , hers was not the English beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damask cheeks , rosy lips , and clear blue eyes of flattering sonnets . Esmera 's was an exotic beauty , born of some remote clime . Her skin was as dark as a Moor 's , and for all Joan knew she might have hailed from the dark continent . She was really too tall for a woman , at least six feet , Joan estimated . And above the full upper lip was a thin patch of dark downy hair , like a little moustache . As to age , the woman was neither girl nor matron , but something in between . Joan was utterly and helplessly fascinated . " I am Esmera , " the woman herself confirmed in a thickly accentedbut mellifluous voice of surprising deepness . Joan thought the accent was as strange as the woman herself . " So you have come to speak with Esmera , " said the woman . Esmera smiled and displayed perfectly formed white teeth . " I came to look . . . at your tent , " said Joan , nervously . " The signs caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , the signs , " Esmera said . " They are not without their meanings . " She turned slightly to face the tent wall and with a graceful motion of her arm pointed to the symbols . " These are the governors of men 's destiny , " she said , indicating the heavenlybodies  --  the moon , sun , and stars  --  that surrounded the hand . " To observe their times and seasons , their positions and relations , is to know the secrets of the universe  --  and the destinyof man and woman . " Esmera began to speak of eclipses and constellations , planets and the signs of Zodiac , and a dozen other notions of her occultp63science . All these , she said , were related to another branch of knowledge , that of the human hand , which knowledge she called cheirognomy and cheiromancy . This was wisdom derived from the Chaldeans and Egyptians and other ancient peoples , and it was in this knowledge that Esmera was especially adept . " There are seven types of hands , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smoothness of the flesh , and the proportion of fingers to palm . Hands with short , thick fingers , short thumbs , and large , thick , and hard palms betoken crass and sluggard brains . Hands that are knotty , with large thumbs and phalanges of similar length , show an equal measure of will and common sense  --  a philosopher 's bent . " The palms of the hands were surrounded by various upraised areas Esmera called Mounts , named after the planets  --  of Venus , Jupiter , Saturn , Apollo , Mercury , Mars , and the moon . The center of the palm was occupied by the Plain or Triangle of Mars and was comprised of three distinct lines , the Line of Life , the Line of Head , and the Line of Heart . These various signs , along with their waviness , forked terminations , ascending and descending branches , breaks , and capillaries , were also indicationsof destiny . Esmera paused in her discourse and turned to face Joan again . She asked her if she would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a woman of good sense , " Esmera said , regarding Joan with interest . " Wo n't you come inside ? " Joan was hesitant , and yet more curious than ever . During Esmera 's lecture she had gradually moved her own hands out of the cunning-woman 's sight , from a kind of painful selfconsciousness . She knew her own hands were small and delicate , her fingers pointed and the flesh smooth . But of this type of hand Esmera had not spoken , and now Joan wondered what these familiar mechanisms at the end of each arm might speak of her own character and destiny . " Only for a while , " Joan said . Esmera led her inside . The tent interior was close and redolent with an unfamiliarp64but not unpleasant scent . The only furnishings were a small , round table without covering and two simple stools set on an earthen floor watered to keep the dust down . Esmera settled onto one of the stools and directed Joan to sit on the other . " Let me have your hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joan did as she was told . Esmera turned Joan 's hand so that the palm was turned upward . And then taking the hand firmly in her own two hands , Esmera began to look at Joan 's palm with a steady gaze , as though her vision was penetrating beyond the pink flesh to the bones beneath . " A goodly temperature of the flesh , " Esmera said , after a long period of silence during which Joan 's self-consciousness intensified and her hand felt warm and moist . " Neither cold nor hot but in between . The color is good too . Your hand is small and delicate , a thin palm and smooth fingers , long and shapely . The joints show but a slight swelling . . . a pretty little thumb . You are a dreamer , impulsive . You desire the beautiful things of life , whether mundaneor celestial . You are ruled by heart and soul . " Esmera 's voice was dreamy and smooth , like syrup . Joan listenedintently , much too intrigued and flattered by this concentratedattention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description came very close to her own assessment . While Joan thought herself a woman of great practicality , she was aware of the other side of her personality , a side often hidden from others : airy , elusive , rooted in the world of dreams and visions , the intangible and unseen . " But now I must turn to the lines of the palm , " Esmera said decisively when her portrait of Joan 's character had been drawn to its fullness and Joan 's silence had implied agreement with all Esmera had spoken . " First , the line of life . " Esmera traced the well-defined crevice setting the region of the thumb off from the central plain of Joan 's palm . " The Mount of Venus is very prominent . You admire beauty and melodyin music and dance . You desire to please . You are a great lover of society , with a talent for friendship and loyalty . Thep65line rising from the base of the hand is a sign of good luck . As for the life line itself , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Esmera paused and her eyes widened . For a long time she studied Joan 's hand in silence , and Joan became nervous with expectation . Was something wrong ? Was something written in the line that betokened ill ? " What is it you see ? " Joan finally asked when the cunningwoman'ssilence was no longer bearable . Esmera did not respond at once . She took Joan 's other hand and seemed to compare the two . Then she said : " There is a break in the line of life . See , it is here . " Esmera pointed to an interruption in the otherwise distinct crevice in the pale flesh . " Fortunately for you , lady , such a break appears only in the left hand , not in the right . " " What does that mean ? " Joan asked urgently , her voice tremblinga little . She studied her own outstretched hand and saw that the line of life was indeed broken . It ceased abruptly with a few parallel lines intersecting while the lower branch of the break turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling of flesh Esmera had referred to as the Mount of Venus . Esmera said : " If the break occurs in both palms , it is a sign of death . The veer of the broken line toward Venus 's Mount is a warning of sudden death . Since it is only one hand that shows such a sign , however , you need fear only the danger . And soon . " " The danger of death ? Soon ? When ? " Joan 's heart was racing now ; her heart lodged in her throat so that she could hardly get the questions out . " How old are you , lady ? " " Mrs. Stock . My name is Mrs. Stock . I will be thirty-eight come November . " Esmera bent over Joan 's hand , tracing the line of life again . " The danger will be soon . This very year and season , " Esmera said.  | " What else do you see in my hand ? " Joan asked . Esmera shut her eyes . She seemed to go into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her eyes and stared at Joan 's palm again . " You have a husband , " Esmera said . " I do , " Joan answered . " He makes a good living for you . A tradesman , I think . " " Yes , " Joan murmured , half mesmerized by Esmera 's husky drawl . " He is also an alderman of the town . " " No , " Joan corrected . " A constable . " " A man of position , of authority , " Esmera went on , undauntedby the error . " I see a man of middle years , of pleasant countenance and gentle manner . A good husband for you , yes ? " " A most excellent husband , " Joan said , not without pride . Esmera 's brow furrowed . She retraced the line of life . " I see misfortune , sorrow in your past . " " Oh . " " Loss , death of children . " " Only one of my children lived , " Joan said , her voice trembling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while I thought myself unable to bear living children , then  --  " " Nay , let me tell you , " Esmera said with quiet urgency . " Then you gave birth successfully . The child lived . And grew . She 's a young woman now . " " Yes , it was a girl . " " And married , " Esmera continued , with an expression of triumphplaying around her pale full lips . " Who has children of her own . " " One child . So far . A son , " Joan agreed . " I was about to say as much . Oh , it is all written in your palm , lady . All this past sadness and joy  --  but also the danger I warned you of . Your daughter 's name is Mary . . . Susan . . . perhaps Elizabeth ? " " It is Elizabeth , " said Joan , marveling at the woman 's insight . Was her daughter 's very name written on the palm ? Joan looked at her own hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownp67sense of the maze of wrinkles and crevices near two score in the making . But now Esmera 's eyes were no longer focused on Joan 's outstretched hand ; again she seemed to retreat into some vision not wholly dependent upon physical contact . Esmera swayed a little on her stool and made a low crooning noise . Joan asked if she were well and received no reply . The crooning and swaying continued and Joan felt afraid again . Was some new warning at hand ? She waited . " I see grave danger for you , Mrs. Stock , " Esmera said , her eyelids beginning to flutter a little while she continued to sway on the stool . " And your husband . Here in Smithfield . . . dangerclose at hand . " " What manner of danger ? " Joan cried , excitedly . " I see a beast . " " A beast ? " " Teeth dripping with blood , cruel fangs . Claws . Raw , bloody flesh . The odor of death . " Esmera began to ramble incoherently ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joan dared not speak and was horrified both at Esmera 's vision and her present appearance , which had twisted her countenanceinto that of a mad woman 's . Yet she had no choice but to wait until Esmera 's fit passed , which it presently did , the cunning-woman 's shoulders slumping and her head falling so that her chin rested heavily on her chest and Joan could no longer see the moist dark eyes . Esmera seemed totally exhausted by her vision . But , looking up , she appeared normal now , and Joan was not frightened as before . " Are you well , Esmera ? " Joan ventured again . " I am well , " Esmera replied in a voice both deeper and weaker than before . " Do n't be alarmed , Mrs. Stock . You will come close to death but it shall miss you  --  with good fortune and . . . the proper precautions . I can not say the same for your husband , however . " " My husband ! You mean he faces the same danger  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p68Esmera  nodded her head as if to say yes , it was all to be , fated , as certain as the tracery of Joan 's palm . " And these precautions you mention  --  what are they ? " Joan thought to ask . Esmera frowned and shook her head . She released Joan 's hand and laid it on the round tabletop as if to signal that their interview was over . " I can see no more . Not at this time . You must come again to see Esmera . " Joan rose ; the wooziness that she had experienced earlier now returned to intensify the anxiety the cunning-woman 's warning had inspired . She looked down at Esmera . " I do n't know if I can , " Joan said . " My husband and I are in London only for the fair . In three days ' time we will return to Chelmsford . " " But you must come again , " Esmera insisted , looking up at Joan with her large dark eyes . Joan undid her purse from the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to pay Esmera , but the woman made a gesture of her hand suggesting that she wanted nothing for advice . " I charge you nothing , Mrs. Stock . I will take nothing from you . Please , believe me , you and your husband are in grave danger . About such matters Esmera is never wrong . Come again , and soon . I may learn more . Remember , you may enjoy long life . I have seen the same in your palm . But the danger is unmistakable . Death is close at hand for you and your husband ... " Esmera 's voice trailed off . She shook her head with the tragic air of one who knows that there is no controlling what the stars have ordained or fate had inscribed in the smooth palm . Joan felt a chilling sensation in her backbone , compounding her anxiety . She mumbled her thanks to the strange woman and stepped out into the stark sunlight . Joan 's head reeled and throbbed ; she was half-blinded by the glare . For a moment she stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumble of symbols and felt the very image pressing down on her like the threatening hand of an angry parent ready to strike an unruly child . She tried to shake off thep69aftereffect of Esmera 's prophesy through the force of will , but the unfamiliarity of her surroundings aggravated her confusion . She looked around and decided to go at once to the Close . She wanted desperately to find Matthew and tell him all that had transpired since she had left him . As she hurried , her brain told her that Esmera 's knowledge might have been nothing more than a clever imagination , but in her heart she felt otherwise . Esmera 's words had thrust deep into her soul and planted there seeds of uncertainty and fear , and even as she fled Esmera 's tent Joan could sense the seeds beginning to grow . As she approached the Close , Joan saw Matthew emerging from the gate , Babcock with him . The two men were deep in conversation , laughing and gesturing , and for a moment Joan suppressed a twinge of irritation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had Esmera not seen the beast ? And what beast could she have seen , save Samson , Babcock 's own fighting bear , the terror of Smithfield and bane of foolhardy dogs ? In the twenty paces she traveled between the realization and her arrival at where Matthew stood , her excited brain pictured the creature in startling clarity . The teeth and enormous claws were clean of flesh and blood now . But what of later ? How Joan wished she could escape from this horrible place with its vicious animal stench and the blood of the poor , suffering hounds . Men 's sport ! she thought with disgust . She interrupted Matthew without as much as a by-your-leave and told him she was sick unto death and wanted to return straightway to the inn , an assertion the great bulk of which was true . Matthew received this word with alarm . " Sick ! Pray God it is no contagion . Did you eat anything since last we met ? Bartholomewpig is wondrous rich and can quite undo a delicate stomach . " " I ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . " Why , you 're as pale as a ghost , " Matthew said.  | " Paler , " observed Babcock , making a sympathetic but helplessface . " We will go back to the inn , " Matthew said . " Are you able to walk or should I find some conveyance ? " " I can walk , " Joan replied stiffly , and the truth was she was less sick now , although very hot and weary . " I 'm so sorry , Mrs. Stock , " said Babcock . " Pray this indispositionis only temporary . Come , join me for supper this very evening . We 'll have a room to ourselves in the Hand and Shears . I 'm eager for the both of you to meet my investors . My daughter , Juliet Beauchamp , will also be there . " Joan accepted the invitation as gracefully as her excited state of mind would allow , and looked appealingly at her husband . The two men shook hands , bid each other farewell , and then Matthew took Joan 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the unhappy consequences of sojourning in a strange place , " he said worriedly as they walked . " These sudden revolts and stirrings of the belly . " " Well , it was no pig , " Joan maintained steadfastly . " I 'll say more anon . For now , I need nothing but to wash off this dust and lie down for a while . "  | " A fortune-teller ! " Matthew exclaimed in a tone to suggest that Joan was quite out of her mind . " What , did she cast your nativity water or wound your ears with blather about horoscopesand the conjunction of planets ? " " Do n't mock me , husband , " Joan warned  --  grateful , however , that he had saved this outburst of cynicism for the privacy of their chamber at the inn . In the street she had been of no stomach to conduct the quarrel that now threatened . " The woman did nothing more than plow my palm with her thumb and forefinger , from which plowing she reaped a rich harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he scoffed . " About me . And you . And yes , about Elizabeth our daughter as well  --  and her child . She said you were constable of the town and in the way of wealth . She said we had a single daughterwho in turn had but one child . Why , she even told me our daughter 's name . Now , tell me , Matthew , how was this fortune-tellerable to do that save she was possessed of some art ? " " Oh , I grant she has art , " her husband returned . " Joan , you amaze me  --  you , a woman whose mind I have always revered for its common sense , its  --  " " No more flattery ! You have bent your bow , now make from the shaft . " " So , then , " commenced Matthew , with a determined sigh and what she thought was a rather fierce expression for him . " Let us begin with my constableship , of which you say this woman informed you . It 's no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that gown that covers your nakedness or that French hood that crowns you . A grocer or ironmonger of myp72income could not have clothed his wife withal , but since cloth is my trade that garment that a gentleman 's wife would not have scorned was well within my means . Is my wealth not a likely inference , then ? And since your speech betrays you as an outlander , was it not equally probable that your well-to-do husbandheld some office in his town ? " " She did first suppose you were an alderman , " Joan conceded . " Indeed ! And I would wager it was you , not she , who announced that I was a constable . " " It was so , " Joan said . " It takes no great wit to suppose a wealthy townsman holds either office . " " But what of Elizabeth  --  her name and the fact she had but one child ? " " I can not say , " Matthew replied dismissively . " But on my faith , the knowledge was derived not from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a trick , I tell you . From a few stones of accurate information , this kind can erect a great house that seems as real and plausible as God 's word . But it is all illusion at last . " " She felt the palm , " Joan persisted . " She had a vision of danger , as I have said . " Her husband sighed with exasperation . He stood looking at her as though her case was beyond help , as though he was a physician at a loss for a diagnosis , much less a cure . " I am much surprised that she did not prophesy some curious encounter with an attractive stranger , a long voyage at sea , or the discoveryof some valuable roundabout the house . Such stale stuff is the common content of their discourse . Go you to Cow-lane where the cunning-men keep company and watch those goshawkspick the brains and pockets of the innocent and gul-lible . " " It was a vision of danger , " Joan insisted . " A mere variation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not suppose this woman said what danger , from what quarter it was to come and with what exact con/sequences . Was not the prophecy in fact vague and murky like vegetables floating in a thick soup , nine-tenths of them submergedand the rest barely discernible in the pot ? Whoever heard a cunning-woman foretell a stranger 's visit but she claimed ignorance of the stranger 's name and hour of arrival . It is all gross imposture , the lot of it ! " " Esmera seemed most sincere , " Joan said feebly . " I warrant you , she did . You shall not find in London a more sincere-sounding person . That is her stock in trade . None of them but they ooze sincerity , and it 's a cool head indeed that sees through it to the truth . " " I just do n't know . I 'm confused , " Joan admitted . " Well , given we are in London and in Smithfield , which is the worse , a vision of danger is not out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cutpurses abound , as I have warned you . Tricksters on every hand . Sword-and-buckler bulliesand saucy bawds . This cunning-woman might have deliveredthe same prophecy to a Cow-lane alewife and with equal justice . " " She did n't charge a penny , " Joan said , as though this were the ultimate verification . " Now there 's the marvel , " her husband replied cynically . " A cunning-woman she may be but she 's no businessman who sells her wares at such a price . I wonder what she meant by that ? No doubt she wants you to return and become a regular seeker of her arcane wisdom , for which , growing dependent on such murky counsel , you will in time become her mainstay . The first visit is but bait for the unwary fish . Beware her lure , Joan . It 's all vile deception , every whit . " " And my fears groundless ? " she said . Matthew walked over to where Joan sat on the bed , feeling very dejected and , yes , foolish too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , tracing the lines in her left palm with the forefinger of his right , much as Esmera had done not an hour before . " Upon your palms I see happiness writ and I am but ap74clothier , no prophet . I see a fruitful life , a loving and devoted husband , a grateful and dutiful daughter , and a host of admiringfriends . Is n't that enough ? What , must you seek out the dangers that in truth lie all around and from which God has half-protected us by keeping us ignorant of them ? " It was not an unreasonable question and Joan gave it some consideration . Matthew stooped to kiss her cheek tenderly . " Come , now , " he said in a suasive voice . " Do n't let 's quarrel about this . It 's much ado over very little . This Esmera is a kind of entertainer  --  like the jugglers and acrobats . Her trade is words , rather . And hers have given you unrest . So , then , they are but words at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all there was to it . In Joan 's mind , Esmera continued to cast a spell : she could still hear the strange woman 's deep throaty voice , see the dark moist eyes . Yet Joan was weary of arguing . She appeared to concede the point to Matthew but only in exchange for the quiet it would bring , the chance to stretch out on the bed and sleep . " Perhaps I was gulled after all , " she said , forcing a smile to conceal her lingering uncertainty . " Do n't say gulled , " Matthew said . " You 've lost nothing from the experience but a brief hour of happiness that might otherwise have been yours . Say , rather , that you were undone by the heat of the day , the strangeness of the place , and the charm of this Esmera . What is passed is done with . God be thanked that you are my own dear Joan again . For me , that is quite enough . " She let him help her , put her to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the energy for shame , much less protest . He pulled the coverlet up over her and gently tucked it around her neck . " I have some business at the Guildhall that will occupy me for the next two hours , " he whispered . " Come suppertime we 'll go upstairs to Ned Babcock 's feast and forget our troubles in good fellowship and song . Ned is no mean host , I warrant you . And the cost of the meal is his alone . He won that honor for himself in losing a wager to me. "  |p75She  thought to ask what manner of wager but the words never came . She listened to her husband 's farewell drowsily , as though she had taken a sleeping potion and was fast on the way to oblivion . She had not realized how weary she was until now  --  from the long journey , she supposed ; from the heat and strangeness of the place , as Matthew had argued . With half-closed eyes , she stared up at the netherside of the canopy stretching above her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or design , but in the instant before she crossed the threshold betwixt sleep and awake she thought she saw again the mystical symbols that had adorned Esmera 's tent and heard blended with the soft tread of her husband 's retreat the low incantation of the cunning-woman 's prophecy . At dusk of that day , Rose again was sent to the muckhill with another bucketload of garbage from Ursula 's makeshift kitchen . Her earlier trip had yielded no view of the bearward 's helper , but she was undaunted and approached her destination with joyful anticipation . Gabriel was not there . No one was there . The pit had been dug several days earlier to accommodate the refuse the fair was sure to generate and in the waning light it presented to Rose a spectacle of utter desolation . A great moldering heap of filth , a stinking pile that would have been quite nauseating had she not been accustomed to it by now . Standing there , her buckets at her feet as yet unemptied , she stared out over the pit . How she wished Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift her spirits from her sadness . She said the prayer he had taught her and crossed herself ( he had not taught her that gesture  --  a vestige of Roman idolatry , he would have said ) . She began to empty the buckets . As she emptied the last and was preparing to return to the pigwoman'sbooth , her view fell upon an object sticking out from a pile of refuse . It was a shoe , a shoe that she supposed by some mischance had been cast away . Being of an economical turn of mind , Rose reached down and grasped the toe , thinking that someone 's negligence might be her good fortune.  |p76But  that there was more there than the shoe she soon realized , as she yanked it forth from the refuse . There was an ankle too , in patched worsted hose , and a lower limb ending in midcalfin bloody , ragged flesh and bone . She stared at her discovery with disbelief while a scream of horror welled up inside her . She let the thing drop back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of terror and disgust . She screamed and screamed until someone came . More than one , a whole crowd , gathering around her and the muckhill , wanting to know what was the matter . " It 's Ursula 's girl , " someone said . " What 's her difficulty ? A rat bit her , I reckon . " Another voice  --  Rose recognized it as Jack Talbot 's  --  was more sympathetic . She pointed to the offending object and someone , not the wine seller but someone else , bent over to examine it and uttered an expression of disgust and then ran away . " It 's bloody murder , that 's what it is , " declared the authoritativevoice of another . " Someone fetch the sergeant and the watch . " " Yes , " said someone else , " go find Grotwell . He 'll want to have a look at this . " " Someone search for the rest of him , " said another . " Bring torches . " " Search yourself , if you 're so keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's ? " " ' T is for a fact , unless beasts are shod and hosed in worsted . Quick , someone go fetch Grotwell. "  |p77Later  the same evening , Joan , physically refreshed from her two-hours ' nap and in a better mind for company , went with Matthew to the Dolphin , a handsomely appointed chamber where the inn 's guests and their friends could take supper in private . They were greeted at the door by a smiling Ned Babcock , who was already mildly drunk . Within the chamber , a round table had been laid . About a half-dozen somber people stood at a sideboard , where various dainties and a large bowl of punch had been served . Whatever conversation had been in progress now ceased with the arrival of the newcomers . Babcock ushered them in and began a round of introductions . " Now , Francis Crisp you already know , " he said with a forced joviality oddly in contrast to the glum expressions of the rest of the company . " And this young woman is my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rather plain-faced girl of twenty-one or twenty-two . Juliet was small and of compact figure . Dressed in black , she wore the resentful expression of one not present by her own will . She curtsied at the introduction and seemed uncomfortable . With a pained expression , Babcock reminded them that his daughter had been recently widowed , hence her mourning garments . " A terrible accident , " he said , without explaining just what sort of accident it had been . Joan expressed her sympathy ; Juliet nodded . Joan felt a coolness between the girl and her father , and her curiosity was aroused , but before she could speculate further on the cause of their dispute , Joan 's attention was directed to her host 's next guest , a thin , tallow-faced man of about thirty-five , in a hand/some worsted suit of elegant cut . This , Babcock said , was Mr. John Pullyver . Pullyver was a greengrocer with a shop in Cheapside and a house in Blackfriars . Since Joan knew that many greengrocers supplemented their incomes by lending money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find one among Babcock 's investors . Indeed , as Babcock explained , this singularly unprepossessing man was the principal investor in the Smithfield Bear Gardens . While Babcock 's long introduction of the greengrocer was in progress , Joan noticed that Pullyver was casting intermittent glances at Juliet . And when Babcock presently said that the greengrocer 's wife had died only recently , leaving him with three small children at home , Joan guessed that Pullyver was a widower in want of a wife  --  and the wife he wanted was Juliet Beauchamp . But did Juliet want him ? Joan did n't think so . Babcock conductedher and Matthew to his remaining guests . These included a scrivener named Ralph Chapman and his wife , Margaret . Chapman was tall and loose-jointed and not quite as prosperous-looking as the greengrocer . He was also one of Babcock 's investors , but because Babcock treated Chapman with less obsequiousness than he had the greengrocer , Joan suspectedthe scrivener 's investment was also less substantial . Chapman 's wife was a round , red-faced woman who in other circumstances might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seemed a friendly sort , but oppressed by what appeared to Joan more a business meeting than a social gathering , despite the supper in the offing and the dainties already on the sideboard . When Babcock told the Chapmans , man and wife , that the Stocks were from Chelmsford , neither seemed to have heard of the town . " Mr. Stock is constable there , " said Babcock . The greengrocer Pullyver evinced mild interest ; he took his eyes off the young widow he wanted and said that he had recentlyseen at the Globe one of Mr. Shakespeare 's plays , whichp79featured a constable named Dogberry . " A very droll , comical fellow , though somewhat deficient in intellect , " said Pullyver . Matthew said he had not heard of such a character or seen the play . " You have heard of Mr. Shakespeare ? " asked Pullyver , with an incredulous expression that anticipated a negative answer . Matthew said that he had ; indeed , he had seen at least one of his plays . And at the Globe . Pullyver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began rattling off the names of a dozen plays he had attended during the last quarter . To Joan it was all boasting , probably for Juliet 's benefit , although she thought the young woman in mourning looked distinctly unimpressed by it all . Two other strangers were in the room and Babcock now led Matthew and Joan on to them . One was the Clerk of the Fair , a Mr. Rathbone . Rathbone was a stout , distinguished-looking man with prematurely graying hair . At his waist he carried a watch , an invention still novel enough to proclaim the social prestige of its wearer . Standing by him was a man of about fifty , with the cadaverous expression of an undertaker . This fellow , named Foote , had also something to do with the fair . Like Rathbone , Foote nodded cordially at the Stocks and welcomed them both to London . But Joan was still aware of a tension in the room , as though her and Matthew 's entrance had merely interrupted some unpleasantness that would resume once they left again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the corner , away from the other guests . He was dressed very shabbily for the occasion in a garb hardly more decent than that she had seen him in that morning at the pit , when he was hot and sweaty from labor and still stinking of the bear . Crisp 's eyes looked glassy and his expression vacant as though his mind was somewhere else , perhaps back at the pit with his beloved Samson . Like his business partner , Crisp hadp80been partaking of the punch in great quantities , and he seemed unsteady on his feet . The introductions completed , supper was now served . Severalwaiters came in bearing the first course  --  a salad of dry greens and cucumbers . " At last , " cried Babcock . " The food ! Come , let 's sit and eat . Let each give thanks to God in his own heart  --  and express it by leaving not a morsel uneaten . " " Nor a drop undrunk , " added Francis Crisp from his corner , saluting the chamber with a newly emptied glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stony-faced Juliet Beauchampto her chair . Juliet was seated opposite the greengrocer and Joan across from her husband . At her left was the Clerk of the Fair and across from her Babcock and his partner . On around were the scrivener Chapman and his plump wife . At Matthew 's side was the cadaverous Mr. Foote , whose mordant expression was no brighter at the prospect of a free meal and who studied his plate of greens with the concerned look of one expecting some disgustinginsect to be concealed beneath the lettuce . They commenced to eat . There was little talk during the first course or the second  --  several sorts of fowl and lumpy pudding . Joan doubted the tall scrivener or his wife were very communicativein the best of times , nor the tallow-faced greengrocer , but she could not remember what funeral or bankruptcy she had experienced that had been quite so solemn . There was somethingsour in the room , the savory food notwithstanding , and that sourness was something more than Francis Crisp 's unwashedlinen . Meanwhile she observed that Babcock seemed indifferent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did likewise . But Joan had no appetite . The tension in the room had taken it away and the want of pleasant conversation  --  the spice of any good meal  --  had left her to her own thoughts , which again turned to Esmera 's prophetic warnings . Joan found herself hearing the cunning-woman 's deep , thickly accented voice , and her eyes were inevitably attracted to the hands ofp81those at the table . Babcock 's were large and ruddy with hairy backs , Crisp 's smaller and brown with gnarled fingers , vivid veins , and broken nails . The greengrocer 's hands Joan found especially intriguing : Pullyver 's fingers were very long , the backs of the hand smooth , white , and hairless , almost puffy , like some exotic vegetable sold in his shop . Joan was beckoning to the waiter to remove her plate , for she wanted no more to eat , when her thoughts were interrupted by a racket of stomping and knocking at the door of the chamber , and then a loud , commanding voice inquiring of anyone within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the next instant , the door burst open and in marched a large , square-faced man in sheriff 's livery , bearing a cudgel . At his heels were two other officers . The scrivener 's wife shrieked with alarm at this unceremoniousentrance and all rose at the table . " I am the man you seek , " Babcock announced in a trembling voice , waving a napkin at the intruder as though he thought to defend himself with it . " What 's your business ? It better be honestbusiness , for I am not alone and undefended here . " He waved an arm around at his guests . " What is it , sergeant ? " asked the Clerk . " Oh , it 's you , Mr. Rathbone  --  and you too , sir , Mr. Foote , " said the leader of the intruders . He apologized for breaking in , then said gruffly , " I 've come in search of the bearward . " " Well , I am he , " Babcock repeated , apparently satisfied that the intruders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dead at the fair , " said the sergeant . " And what 's that to me ? " asked Babcock . " We believe he was killed  --  by your bear . " At this Juliet moaned , turned white as a sheet , and slumped into her chair . " Killed by my bear ! " exclaimed Babcock , unsure as to whether to speak in defense of his bear or see to the condition of his daughter . " Why , my bear has harmed no one . "  | " Well , it appears he has , sir , " said the sergeant . " Come , Grotwell , out with it , fellow , " demanded the Clerk impatiently . " This is a serious charge . Give us the particulars . " " A body has been found at the muckhill at the end of Taylor'slane , " Grotwell said . " I should say a part has been found , for there is hardly more than a shoe and hosed foot and ankle . This same member has been examined by myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And we think the bear has eaten the poor devil that is dead , " said Grotwell . " There 's teeth marks on the bone . God knows where the rest of him is . " " Teeth marks , " said Babcock , giving the sergeant his full attentionnow , for Juliet had recovered and , although pale from the announcement , was having her brow moistened by Joan . " Very large teeth , " said Grotwell , looking at the bearward accusingly . Other guests of the inn who had been attracted to the Dolphinby the uproar had now collected at the door and were looking in with anxious faces . The host of the inn himself appeared , a big , burly man who demanded to know whether there was not sufficient cause to raise the watch , for he was convinceda rebellion was in progress . " We are the watch , " said Grotwell gruffly , turning to the host and ordering him to close the door and mind his own business . Reluctantly and with much complaining that it was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grotwell continued his story . The fragment of body had been found at sundown . By one Rose Dibble , a servant of Ursula , the pig-woman . The girl had screamed her head off and drawn thereby a huge crowd to the muckhill to see . That the body had been ravaged by some huge beast was the general opinion of everyone who had examinedthe grisly remains . Babcock denied that Samson had done it ; a sobered Francis Crisp agreed , if anything , more vehemently . Joan gave over attending Juliet and began to pay more attention to the discussion . Grotwell described the remnant of fleshp83in sickening detail , and Joan thought , Gnawed by a beast , ripped to pieces by a bear . A bear ? Esmera 's prophecy had been fulfilled , after all ! She looked at Matthew . Would he believe her now ? He was following the sergeant 's description intently ; but Joan could n't tell whether he was making the connection or not . " Samson has killed no one , " insisted Babcock . " Save for the hounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature around mankind one could hardly find . Do you really think , sir , " Babcock addressed the sergeant , " that a beast of mine could have made a meal of human flesh and I not know of it ? " " Or I ! " echoed Crisp with a fierce expression . " Do you imagine a poor creature such as he who is dead would have suffered his dismemberment in silence ? " Babcock continued , " Look you now , my bear garden is at the very center of the fair , elbow to elbow to a dozen stalls and booths . Would someone there not have heard the screams of anguish , the ag-ony  --  " " Father ! " said Juliet sharply . Babcock stopped and turned to his daughter . Juliet 's eyes were full of tears , her lower lip trembled . " How can you speak so after what happened ? " she complained bitterly . Babcock turned back to the sergeant , but said no more . Crisp now took over the defense of the bear . " Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no evidence it was Samson . He 's not the only bear in London . " " That 's true , " Pullyver said . " It may have been another creaturethat did this . " " Come now , sergeant , what proof have you that it was Samsonand not some other ? " Babcock said . " Do n't I know a bear 's tooth when I see it ? " snapped Grotwell , heated now . " And indeed there are bears in London , but what of Smithfield ? There I know of only one and Samson is his name . " An angry exchange followed between Crisp and the sergeant , in which Crisp said that Grotwell did n't know a bear from hisp84own buttocks and the sergeant said that he certainly did and told Crisp where he might put the bear and his filthy mouth too . The two men were about to come to blows , which would have been indeed unfortunate for Crisp , since he was unarmed , when the Clerk stepped between them and ordered both to be silent . Rathbone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pie-powders , should be notified of the incident at once , but his companion , Mr. Foote , questioned whether this famous court , held during the three days of the fair , would have jurisdiction . A debate followed between the two men , which was finally resolved in the Clerk 's favor . Grotwell sent one of his men to notify the Justice . Now Matthew came forward and said , " Could it not have been wild dogs who ate the poor fellow , perhaps finding him somewhere dead first , then dragging the body off to the muckhill ? It would n't be the first time such a thing has hap-pened . " Babcock and Crisp thought this a very fine suggestion , and Babcock said that the very thing had occurred within living memory , to an unfortunate and aged ragpicker who had frozen to death one winter in Holborn and whose body parts were found thereafter scattered over an area of several miles . " I would have supposed dogs had done it myself , sir , " said Grotwell , eyeing Matthew with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-spoken citizen might be . " The truth appears otherwise . If Mr. Babcock and the rest of you masters will accompany me to where the body was found , each may examine the remains to his heart 's content . I assure you that no dog or pack of them killed the man . It was a large animal , and I doubt that it was any other than Mr. Babcock 's bear . " " If what the sergeant says proves true , " said the Clerk , turning to Babcock and regarding him with a serious expression , , , your Samson must die by order of law . There 's no help for it ,  |p85not  after what happened to your son-in-law , William Beau-champ . " " That was not Samson 's fault , " Babcock protested . But it was , Joan thought , a half-hearted protest , uttered with more bluster than conviction . She noticed that Babcock cast a sidelong glance at his daughter . Juliet 's face was turned away from her father . The girl was still distraught by the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out more about William Beauchamp 's death . It was clear from what the Clerk had said , and Babcock conceded , that Samson had killed him . But what had been the circumstances ? " Grotwell , lead the way , " said the Clerk . " Those who wish may follow . " Matthew told Joan he would accompany the others to the scene of the crime , but Joan had little interest herself in viewingthe grisly remains or in traipsing about Smithfield after dark . She said that she would go up to their room and wait his return . There was now a brief leave-taking on all sides . Pullyver said he would see that Juliet Beauchamp was safely delivered to her own home . The Chapmans thanked their host for their supper and begged to be excused from the expedition to the muckhill . Both husband and wife looked pale and distraught . It had been an evening few of them would forget soon . In her chamber , the door barred behind her and the tall candlesflickering uncertainly , Joan sat on the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day : the tour through Smithfield , the visit to the bear garden , her consultation with the fortune-teller , and , most recently , this unpleasant supper and most horrid discovery of murder  --  if that was indeed what it was . But whatever it was , deliberate savaging by bear or the carrion work of less threatening beasts , it presented to her mind a grim omen . Certainly Esmera 's prophecy had been fulfilledp86and with dispatch . Joan wondered now what greater horrors awaited . She uttered a prayer for Matthew 's safe return and began to prepare for bed . As she did , she wondered who the unfortunate victim of the muckhill murder had been . An itinerant peddler perhaps ? Worse , some innocent child astray in that region of stinking devastation ? But would a bear have wandered there , unrestrained and unobserved , to do the deed ? That did seem most unlikely . Then she had a terrible thought ; her heart sank with it . What if it was the bearward 's helper who was slain  --  this very evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the monster that had done it was now loose in Smithfield , foragingfor more human meat ? She had a vision of the handsome young man she had observedthat morning and the girl he loved , and wept softly for the very pity of it.  |p87S|pectral  shapes of men , women , and children , illuminated by torchlight , had gathered around the muckhill . They talked in whispers and moved aside obediently when the officers came . Matthew followed behind the Clerk , the sergeant , and the two bearwards to where several of the sergeant 's men had earlier formed a protective ring around Rose Dibble 's gruesome discovery . The truncated limb rested upon a piece of dirty rag someone had found amid the refuse and retrieved to afford a modicum of dignity to the dead man 's remains . The foot and calf lay there , the focus of every eye that could see it , like a religious relic , but the response they provoked was not reverence but fear . Matthew knelt down to examine the remains . The foot was poorly shod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much patched . A fragment of sharp , white bone protruded from the hose and bore the marks of the powerful teeth that had snapped it from the rest of the body , like a twig broken from a dead branch . It was obvious to Matthew the dead man had not been mauled by a dog . Obvious too that the onlookers were of the same mind . Something had made a meal of some human soul , something large and vicious  --  much to the disgrace of the fair and the peril of them all . The whispering Matthew overheard suggested that something had been Ned Babcock 's bear . " The creature should be killed forthwith , " muttered someone standing behind Matthew . " Tortured first  --  drawn and quartered , " said a second voice , hard with malice.  | " Boiled in oil , blinded , and declawed , " said yet another . " God only knows what other poor devil he 's eaten , " said the first voice . " Where 's the rest of him ? That 's what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll warrant . " Matthew heard these comments at his back and did n't like the sound of them . The crowd at the muckhill was more than frightened ; it was looking for someone to blame for the outrage . Ned Babcock 's bear seemed the inevitable choice . He noticed that the two bearwards had been strangely silent since arriving at the muckhill , especially in contrast to their vigorous defense of Samson at the inn . Neither man had pushed forward for a closer view of the corpse . Was this because they knew already that Samson was to blame  --  that the great bear was a destroyer of mankind as well as dog ? Or was it because they feared to be identified as the owners of this alleged monster ? In either case , the silence of the two men had made them inconspicuous and that was well for both . Matthew knew from bitter experience how quickly a nervous multitude could turn into a raging , howling mob . Perhaps Rathbone , the Clerk of the Fair , knew this too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the muckhill would be searched for more evidence , announced it loudly so that his voice carried over the whispers of the crowd and the occasional whimpering of children dragged from their beds to see this new wonder . At this , some of the gawkers began to disperse , either because their curiosity was satisfied or because they feared to be compelled to search the refuse for the rest of the body  --  a task well within the sergeant 's right to order . The Clerk directed Grotwell to send the rest of them home . Then they were alone  --  the Clerk and the officers and the bearwards and Matthew  --  in that expanse of awful darkness . The single torch that remained and was held by one of Grotwell'smen did very little good in dispelling the eeriness of the place . " What do you say now , Mr. Babcock ? " Grotwell asked , turn/ing to where the bearward stood . " Have you seen what Samson has done ? Come have a good look then , and persuade me if you can this is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no answer to this challenge . Then he said , " I 've seen enough . I grant it was no dog . " He sighed heavily . " But can you prove it was a bear and not some other animal ? " " Perhaps the lion that is kept and shown in the Tower has escaped and feeds in Smithfield , " suggested one of the sergeant 's men in a sarcastic voice . Grotwell turned angrily on the man and told him to shut up . " No lion , " Babcock said . " Maybe it was a bear , God knows . But can you prove it was my particular bear ? " The Clerk and the sergeant discussed this . The Clerk thought the evidence was insufficient against the bear or its owner , but Grotwell said the condition of the remains was proof enough for any reasonable man . The two began to argue , with no little help from the two bearwards , who sided naturally with the Clerk . Finally the Clerk remembered that Justice Baynardwas the person to decide such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman now waited at home for further report . Grotwell agreed . " Yes , by all means , sir , let Justice Baynarddecide . But I swear that if he does not issue a warrant for both bear and bearward within the hour , I do n't know the Justice'smind in these matters . " " We will do what Mr. Baynard directs , " replied the Clerk coldly . " He is both honest and thorough . " " Let 's proceed to Mr. Baynard 's house , then , " said the sergeant , for it was very late , the air at the muckhill pestilent , and the presence of the corpse unnerving to them all . One of the officers asked the sergeant what was to be done with the dead man  --  or what remained of him  --  and before the sergeant could reply Rathbone interrupted to say that it could not very well be left where it was and that it must be removed . Grotwell said that he had no intention of leaving the evidence where it was for some dog to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let him have a look at it . He directed one of his men to wrap up the foot and calf and carry it after him . The officer designated , however , was very hesitant to touch the dead man 's remains and begged to be excused from the task . Grotwell cursed him roundly and told him that if he disobeyed a simple order as he had been given , he was n't worth a damn in the watch and he might lose his office and , yes , rot in the stocks too . After that , the officer did as he had been ordered . " Let 's proceed to Mr. Baynard 's house , " said Rathbone impatiently . He was anxious to have the matter settled . Although Matthew was very weary , he agreed to Babcock 's appeal that he go along too . But Grotwell questioned whether Matthew had any proper business accompanying them . " My friend is constable of Chelmsford , " said Babcock . " Is he so ? " answered Grotwell , with a snort of contempt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he should leave his constableship at home and not meddle in matters hereabouts where he has no authority and less knowledge . " " Do you positively forbid him to come , then ? " asked Babcock of the sergeant . " Oh , let him come , if he wills , " said Grotwell , as though he was weary of the subject . " Yet let him keep silent . He may be a constable in Chelmsford , but he is nothing here . " The men moved off and Matthew followed , not because he wanted to but because he could not deny the helplessness in his friend 's face . When Matthew returned , he found Joan in an anxious state . Unable to sleep for worry , she had kept a candle burning , now a mere stub . She greeted her husband with relief and asked him to tell her all that had happened . She wanted to know who had been killed and by what . She said he had been gone so long she was half-afraid he had met the same fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of it , " Matthew said , sparingher the more gruesome details . He sat down on the bed andp91began undoing his shoes . " Something more than dog ate him , my oath upon it . Afterward I went with Ned and the officers to see a magistrate who will inquire into the case . " " The Justice Baynard that was spoken of ? " " The very man . " His shoes were filthy from the muckhill . In his stocking feet he walked across the rush-strewn floor to the hearth and with his knife scraped the soles clean . " They all think Ned Babcock 's bear did it , but this Justice is wise enough to want more proof . " " What sort of proof ? " " The rest of the body , which may well show more bear marks as well as who the poor fellow was . Ned has asked me to help him . " " Help him ? How ? " " By clearing the bear of blame . By finding the true explanation for the death  --  for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician friend of his to examine the re-mains . " " I should n't think the remains would want a physician at this point , " she said . " This physician is  --  or fancies himself  --  capable of drawing a wealth of knowledge from a very few facts , " Matthew said , while he undressed . " They all come to the bear pit in the morning  --  theJustice , the officers . Remains of the dead man come with them . Baynard swears he will get to the bottom of the incident . If the bear 's guilt is confirmed , that 's the end of Samson  --  thelaw will do what dogs could n't . Also the end of Ned 's business venture . " " A pity if the bear is innocent . What do you think ? " she asked . " I do n't know what to think , " he said . " What I wonder , " she said , " is how the poor man 's part got to the muckhill in the first place . Surely he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " I put the same question to the Justice , " Matthew said , yawn/ing sleepily . " He was n't pleased with my sticking my nose in and told me so  --  more elegantly , however , than Grotwell had earlier when Ned urged me to accompany them . A Chelmsford constable is not worth much in Smithfield . " " Well , it 's their loss if they think so , " she said with a snort of defiance . " It is n't really my business , " he conceded . " But he is your friend , " she said , forgetting her plan to ask him to take her away from Smithfield in the morning . Friendshipdid count for something in this world of woe and faithlessness . " I hope Ned did n't find the dead man at the bear gardens and try to dispose of the body himself to protect the bear , " Matthew said . " If he was so foolish  --  " " It would go poorly with him , " she supplied . Joan made no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His complicity had crossed her mind earlier but she had said nothing about it , and she was happy that although her husband had been moved by friendship to provide moral support he had not been completely blinded by old loyalty . " Whatever happened to Mr. Beauchamp , Juliet 's husband ? " Joan thought to ask . " A very sad case , " Matthew murmured . " Evidently he was an ill-tempered son-in-law to Ned and provoked the bear once too often . He took a whip to the beast and Samson repaid him with a blow across the head that near knocked his head off . Juliet blames her father for it . Ned says she is ever after him to give over bearbaiting . " " What a horrible way to die , " Joan murmured . " The mark of the beast , " Matthew said . " What was that ? " " What ? " " What you said . Just now . About the mark of the beast . " " Are you thinking of that fortune-teller again ? " Matthew asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other dead man too  --  the one you and Samuel Hopkins found by the Chelmsford road with the cruel slashes in his forehead . " " A coincidence , surely , " Matthew said . " Besides , the puppeteerwas found all in a piece . " He climbed into bed as though his last words were the end of the subject and blew out the candle . The room became pitch black , a dazzling darkness . He threw an arm over her and snuggledup close , but she took small comfort from his familiar embraceand gentle words . Soon she heard him snoring softly . Joan was still feeling the pressure of her anxiety , a heavy weight upon her heart . In the darkness of the strange room , her fears multiplied and played havoc with her effort to sleep . Later , she gave voice to her fears even though her husband was too deep in sleep to hear . " The beast 's mark . The three of them . He on the road , he in the muckhill , and Juliet 's young husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think no coincidence , as you suppose . " Rose has stopped screaming . Not that she has lost the will but the ability : her throat is as dry as parched grass and her head resounds painfully with the echo of her own cries . Her alarm has brought more than a few witnesses to her distress , who crowd around her asking first what 's wrong with her and then , seeing what she has seen , become quiet and stand or squat there gaping , not sure what is to be done . Jack Talbot has come too . He stands embracing her , like a father . She has buriedher face in the curly brown hairs of his chest , inhaling the familiar wine smell of the man and taking a kind of comfort in it . She is shaking uncontrollably , as though seized by a fever . " Come , girl , come . It 's no sin to find such a thing , but a bit of bad luck ' t was you and not some other , " says Jack Talbot consolingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a sin  --  to find it even , the horrid , ghastly thing . Smithfield is covered by a thick , smoky darkness . More peo/pie , bearing torches , shouting . The word has spread , as such words will , with uncanny speed . But now Rose has told her tale many times over to anyone who will listen , how she found the limb , the savaged flesh . And having told her tale for others to repeat with whatever embellishments they wish , she is led away by the wine seller , his arm around her in a fatherly way . And she has not a tear left for her grief , and the pain in her head is almost more than she can bear . Ursula is not at her booth . Like the others , she has been drawn to the spectacle , for blood and bone are not things shunned by this generation  --  and even women and children turn cold eyes upon dismemberment . " Shall I stay with you ? " the wine seller asks . " Nay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she will . For she also wonders who it is she has found in the muckhill and is filled thereby with a terrible dread . He tells her he must go to see a certain woman living in Cow-lane . On some business , he says . To take her mind off the horror , he asks if she will look in from time to time in his own booth , which is well-stocked in preparation for the next day and unguarded in his absence . She nods her head in agreement . Who knows when Ursula will return ? She may spend an hour at the muckhill or maybe two or three , chattering with her gossips , some of whom she has not set eyes upon since last August . There will be much news to share and considerable speculation . Who is the dead man ? How did he die ? And if murdered , by whom or what ? Jack leaves ; she watches him go until his shadow fuses with other shadows in the dark lane . Paul 's bell sounds nine plaintivetimes over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smithfield . And in her loneliness the thought she fears to think insinuates itself into her poor brain . It is her beloved who is dead  --  sweet Gabriel of the golden voice . Dead and reduced to a tithe of himself . Her fear makes her smaller ; the darkness itself is oppressive , suffocating . Satan rules the night , and she wants to screamp95again to drive the fear that gnaws at her but her throat is raw and she has no breath . Suddenly , she feels a hand upon her shoulder , hears a whisperbehind her . She turns and nearly faints from pure relief . " You 're trembling , Rose . Why ? " Gabriel asks , alive . She moans , " I thought you . . . I was afraid that ... " The tears come again , a torrent , just when she thought hereyes were as dry as her throat . " You thought I was what ? " he asks incredulously , grinning in the darkness . " Dead . " " Dead ? " He laughs an easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the hot tears . Then as best she can , she explains what has happened . She can not read the expression in his eyes but his change of tone suggests that he too is affected by the horror . " Who do they say it was ? " he asks . " No one knows . Only the . . . foot and ankle were there . " He says , " Then they may never know . It 's all one . The dead man 's soul has gone to heaven  --  or hell . " He quotes Scripture to comfort her , and within minutes her mood is lightened . She remembers that it is wrong to mourn the dead excessively  --  and it is easier to follow this admonition if he that is dead is nothing to you , not even a name . Now she remembers that Ursula is gone . The smoky darkness now seems more friendly than oppressive , for it provides a measureof privacy . The voices at the muckhill  --  surely all Smithfield must be gathered there by now  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acrid bear smell about him , the sudden tensing of his muscles at the embrace . He stands stiff and silent . She is so happy to have him alive and to herself that she pays no heed to his lack of responsiveness . And yet neither does he unloosen himself from her embrace . They stand still , alone , and soon she feels a pleasantp96heat in her loins , an ache in her breast . Briefly but painfully she recollects her other encounters with men . But this time and for the first time it is different . Gabriel is different . They were wicked , but he is good and his goodness radiates from him like a warm fire . She lifts her face to his and kisses him . His lips are warm , and her body trembles again ; it is not fear that quickens her pulse , elevates her temperature . She begins to experience an exhilarating sense of power now that she can feel , all along her own body , the growing responsiveness of his . She is very pleased . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . " It is n't safe here , " she whispers . " If not here , where ? " he asks . She thinks cunningly , remembers the wine seller and his plea . " Jack 's booth . The wine seller 's , " she whispers . " He 'll be gone these two hours . He said so . He asked me to look in on his goods . I said I would . " She disentangles herself from his arms and , taking him by the hand , leads him down the dark lane , he following childlike and silent , both stepping softly like thieves . For Rose the journey of a dozen or so yards is too long . Her heart is racing ; the horror at the muckhill is forgotten . The terrible wrath of Ursula is forgotten . All Rose knows is that her present happiness seems to redeemall the miseries of her young life , all the abuse and brutality of act and word , the grinding poverty and cruel neglect . She leads him into the booth , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , where the wine seller 's custom will drink from bottle and cup the next day . Inside it is even darker than the night , and closer . She smells the faint sweetness of the wine , oozing mysteriously through the slats in the barrels and casks . She turns to him . But his mood has changed . She embraces him but now finds no warm responsiveness but rather a shudder of distaste . Thep97journey from Ursula 's booth , intensifying her ardor , has diminishedhis . " No , " he says in a tone that brooks no denial . " It is forbid-den . " Forbidden ? How can what she feels be forbidden ? It is beyond her imagining . She can only stare with her mouth agape at the tall , shadowy figure that is Gabriel , this angel of a man , endowed with God-like power and voice . She hears his preacher 's voice , not unfriendly , but distant : " What we feel in our present condition , unsanctified by the bonds of matrimony , must not be . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better selves , which must not bum with lust but with a sanctified flame of chastity , pure and undefiled . The body is of Satan . " He continues even more passionately . " And it is our bodies that long to couple , like goats or flies . The soul belongs to God , but can only remain pure if the body is in subjection to it . " These are hard words for her to understand , so full of love is she . But then Gabriel quotes again the measured cadences of the Holy Book , the language she adores , and understanding comes . She feels the power not of his rejection now but of his love , feels it burning and near-consuming her flesh . Her will is not her own , her resistance is ashes in his fire . A calmness comes over her , a surrender . " Let 's pray , " he says , kneeling in the booth , kneeling before a great shadowy malmsey butt as though it were a holy altar . She kneels down with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cartwheels and the raucous shouts of hostlers roused Matthew and Joan from sleep . They dressed by candlelight , then went downstairs to breakfast , where all the talk in the great room of the inn was of the maneatingbear , Samson , " the terror of Smithfield , " as Joan heard the beast named by more than one , dependent for his information on nothing more than second- and third-hand accounts of those fortunate enough actually to have seen the bear 's leavings . " Come midday , a dozen ballads will have been composed on the subject , " remarked Matthew dryly . " And each with a different story to tell  --  by an eyewitness , " said Joan . In the gray light of early morning they were on their way to the bear garden , husband and wife speculating on the crime as they walked . Matthew felt sorry for his friend Ned . He said that even if Samson had killed the man , no blame necessarily attached to Ned , yet he would lose his livelihood . Joan agreed things did not look well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner and entered the fair through Gilt-spur Street . When they came to the bear pit they saw a group of men standing at the entrance . Joan recognized Babcock and his partner , the Clerk , and the barrel-chested , gruff-voiced sergeantwho had brought word of the murder the night before . With them were two other men . One was stout and of very grave expression , the other tall and thin and scholarly , dressed in a drab doublet with silver buttons and hose encasing scrawny legs . The man carried a satchel . Babcock saw the Stocks approachand called out a greeting.  | " Good day , Matthew ! And Joan , God save you . " " God save your honors , " replied Matthew , bowing to the stout man and his drab-suited companion . These Joan surmised , since no introductions followed , were Justice Baynard , of the famous Court of Pie-powders , and his friend Thomas Millcock , the celebrated physician of whom Rathbone had spoken to Matthew . Both men regarded the clothier and his wife with a condescending air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock ? " " Again , Mr. Justice , " answered Matthew politely but firmly . Joan took an instant dislike to the haughty magistrate . " I 'm come on Ned 's invitation , " Matthew continued with easy assurance . " If it pleases you . " " I can not say it does , sir , " said Baynard stiffly . " Yet if it be Mr. Babcock 's pleasure , I will not deny you a place here . Pray keep quiet , however . This is the Queen 's business we 're embarked on . " Matthew made another low bow but said nothing more . The conversation that had been in progress at their arrival now resumed . Millcock , the physician , did the talking . He explained that the satchel he carried was full of instruments of his profession , instruments that he had earlier used that morning to examinethe remains of the victim . From his examination , he declared the foot and ankle to have been that of a man in his prime , say twenty-five to thirty , with reddish hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet . A poor man , he said , continuing his observations , as the quality of his shoe and stocking indicated . About the identity of the victim , Millcock could say no more , except that certain incriminating evidence had been found on the sole of the shoe . " And what evidence might that be ? " asked Babcock in a concernedvoice . " Excrementum ursuii , " entoned the learned man . " In plain English , bear shit . " " All that proves is that the dead man was careless in his footing , " remarked Crisp.  | " More , sir , " said the sergeant , addressing the bearward who had just spoken . " It means that your precious Samson ate him , for how else would he have trod upon the animal 's voidings ? " " As easy as yourself , " said Babcock , " for there are traces of it on all this ground . Besides , " he continued , addressing the physician , " how can you say it is the excrement of a bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician cast Babcock a disdainful look and said , " I examined it most carefully , I assure you . The residue is from the bear ; the properties of the excrement match . The facts admit no other explanation . The dead man was only recently in the company of a bear . " " A bear , not that bear , " reasoned Babcock . " We have come full circle again . To say a bear killed the man is not to say Samson did it . " Both the physician and the Clerk of the Fair conceded that that was true by order of logic . Grotwell said he was confident further evidence could be had if only the bear pit were inspected . " And for that reason we are met here , " said Justice Baynard . " Mr. Babcock , lead the way . We shall want to see everything  --  the accused bear , his quarters , everything . " Babcock bowed respectfully to the magistrate and led the way into the pit . Matthew and Joan followed . While the Stocks waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Clerk , and the sheriff spread out and searched the compound . This inspection was thorough , but nothing was found . Then they all went into the tent , where they encountered the bearward 's helper feeding the bear . Joan , who had thought in the worst of her fears that the young man might have been the victim , was pleased to see him hale and hearty . She smiled and nodded to him as she entered and he smiled back and continued to toss to the bear great globs of bloody flesh that the bear was making quick work of , much to the disgust of the great physician and the Justice . Both men commented on the bear 's appetite.  | " It 's his regular breakfast , " explained Babcock defensively . " He eats twice a day , three times if he is to fight . " " He could kill a man and eat him too in less time than it takes to wring a chicken 's neck and pluck it naked , " said Justice Baynard . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the bear devour the last morsels of his breakfast , then beg for more . Blood dripped from his savage jaws . His appetite seemed insatiable . The bottom of his cage was littered with bloody bones . When he saw that he would get no more , Samson rocked back on his shaggy bottom and regarded the men and the woman with his tiny black eyes . The physician said he had seen enough . He said that the guilt of the bear was certainly within the realm of possibility . " Realm of possibility ! " exclaimed the Justice . " Can you not say with greater certainty ? " " I can not , " said Millcock . " Obviously the animal has the capacity  --  thestrength and appetite  --  perhaps even the disposition . That 's plain enough . On the other hand , both the bearwards swear the bear was not permitted to wander from the pit and no witnesses have come forth to testify to having seen him loose . Had he been , surely he would have been seen and an alarm given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead man was killed and eaten by a bear is not to prove it was his particular bear . That , sir , is the long and short of it . My work is done . " With that , Millcock directed his gaze to each person in the tent as though to ask if there were any more questions . Then , pleading an urgent appointment elsewhere , he took his leave . The two bearwards now accompanied Justice Baynard , the Clerk , and the sergeant out of the tent to discuss the matter further . Matthew and Joan remained inside to converse with Gabriel , whom they found a very agreeable , well-spoken young man . Gabriel confirmed that the bear had not been once outside the bear pit and said that he surely would have been awarep102of it had the truth been otherwise . Their conversation with the helper was foreshortened by Babcock 's return . He was all smiles now , and Joan supposed the news was good . It was . Babcock , almost beside himself with glee , gave a rapturousaccount of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him had been suspended and the bear was now free on good behavior , a condition that evidently required constant surveillance of the animal and , above all , no more mysterious deaths in Smithfield . But from what Joan could make of the bearward 's excited report , the decision in Samson 's favor had depended on more than a lack of concrete evidence . Questions of property rights , profits and losses , the reputation of the fair , and the prospect of a larger crowd drawn to Smithfield because of Samson 's notoriety had also been consideredalong with lesser matters such as public safety and the right of the dead man , whoever he was , to be avenged by the law . " My fortune is now made ! " Babcock exclaimed in a transport of happiness . " How so ? " asked Joan , somehow missing the cause of this celebratory mood . " Very simple , " he said . " The Clerk has said it and the Justice agrees . Samson is now the most famous bear in London . A famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan remarked , skeptically . Out of politeness she joined her husband in congratulating the bearward for his narrow escape from public disgrace and financial ruin , but she was not without misgivings . Privately , she thought the bear was guilty as charged and she believed Babcock knew that too and was denying it for perfectly understandablereasons . Babcock had been very lucky , he and his bear . The evidence against Samson , if not conclusive , had at least been more than circumstantial . The body at the muckhill had been ravaged by a large , ferocious animal . That was a fact . The same body , the evidence showed , had been in the vicinity of a bear . The bearwards and their helper swore themselvesp103hoarse the creature had not been out of their sight since their arrival in Smithfield , a claim no witness had come forth to refute . All that was lacking in evidence was something to tie the dead man to the particular bear under suspicion . What Joan could not understand was this : if Samson killed the man , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very tent she now stood ! And if so , then how did the man 's parts get to the muckhill , more than a quarter mile away ? Samson could have dragged the body there , but evidently did n't since it was unthinkable that such a creature could roam the neighborhood without being seen by someone . That left a human accomplice to consider . Babcock himself came first to her mind , or Francis Crisp . Or the both of them . But then , suddenly , she remembered how Gabriel made his journey from the pit to the muckhill twice or thrice a day , with the bear 's waste . That rickety wheelbarrow with its noxious load . She began to suspect him too . Yet he was such an amiable , well-spoken young man . Before it was light enough for Gabriel to see his hand before his face , Babcock had him up and policing the pit and tent . Babcock did not say why , but Gabriel knew . Someone was coming to have a look round , someone important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human remains could be found there . It had not been murder , what he had done . Murder was a sin against God , expressly forbidden . He had carried out a command of that still , small voice in his head  --  the same voice that had told him to kill the puppet master on the London road , the same voice that told him now how nearly he had come to sinningwith Rose Dibble the night before in his dream , if dream could inspire such passion in blood and groin . The flames of desire had engulfed him and had painfully singed his conscience , and although he had since sought the means of his repentance , the reclaiming of the special privilege as an ex/ecutor of God 's judgments on the wicked , the memory lingered and stung . It had been the Devil 's work , his near fall from grace , and he cursed the flesh that so regularly played host to the enemies of his soul . Since his first view of Rose , he had felt a stirring in his bosom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of God 's providential hand upon her . He recognized her as a sanctifiedsister among the Smithfield harlots . And yet she was also woman , a daughter of Eve , clear-eyed and well formed , supple as a young willow , her mouth small and ripe . But even these thoughts flirted with evil and the destruction of his personal righteousness . That morning he had watched while the officers had come to the pit , watched while they poked into corners and stared stupidlyat Samson as though the bear would presently confess his own guilt . He recognized the sergeant in his leather jerkin and the clothier of Chelmsford and his little wife in her finery and hated them with a quiet , intense hatred he reserved for those who thought themselves righteous but inside were rotten with concupiscence and worldliness , dressing their bodies for show , bearing themselves with worldly pride and vanity , regarding with haughty stares those for whom honest poverty was a badge of sanctity . The smug , self-satisfied clothier and his wife , the learned man of science , the minions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh . A book of sermons could not have preached sounder doctrine of their imminent destruction than this parade of fools . They had discovered nothing . As he intended they should not . All were mired in their own ignorance , as blind as bats . God 's work could not be easily brought to naught . Not by the law of a corrupt state , not by the temptations of his own flesh . Nearly undone by a stirring in his groin  --  the very seat of concupiscence  --  Gabriel Stubbs had put the old man from him and had been since his devout prayer of the night before a new man . Now he saw himself in a distinguished company of penitents , beginning with Father Adam . He thought of David andp105his Bathsheba , Solomon with great Sheba 's Queen . There was Samson too , undone , unmanned , unsighted by a woman 's wiles . These were men of renown , and Gabriel 's weakness had placed him among them . But not his sin alone . He realized that his present remorse of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he chastens . Sound doctrine . He would be forgiven and strengthened . The deaths meant nothing , then . His conscience was devoid of offense . The voices in his head , which each day grew more insistent , would be obeyed ; and God 's vengeance on the wicked exacted . By two o'clock Matthew and Joan were part of a mighty throng of holidaymakers lining Gilt-spur Street to hear the Lord Mayor of London proclaim Bartholomew Fair officially begun . Moments before , Joan had stood breathless with excitement and patriotic fervor and nearly deafened too by the explosion of cannon and the clamor of church bells as the Lord Mayor had come riding by , making his way with great difficulty , so large was the press of bodies packing the narrow street , all waving and cheering . Resplendent in his scarlet gown and gold chain of office , the Lord Mayor was preceded by a liveried servant bearing scepter , sword , and cap upon a velvet pillow and was followed by twelve Principal Aldermen of the City , also adorned in scarlet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much appreciated this spectacle . They howled with delight , elbowed for positions of better vantage , gaped at the gowns and jewels that were worth a king 's ransom . The Mayor and his retinue stopped before the Great Gate , remaining mounted the better to be heard and seen . As the crowd grew quiet , the Lord Mayor unrolled a large scroll handed to him by an Alderman and began to read the proclamation . He first commanded that all those present keep the peace during the fair . Then he directed merchants of wine , ale , beer ,  |p106and  bread to sell by honest weights and measures . This was a popular injunction , and there was a great roar of approval from the crowd . When the clamor had ceased , the Mayor went on to enjoin all those who might have complaint not to take the law into their own hands but present their grievances to the Stewardsof the Fair , by whom he meant the Justices of the PiePowders . In concluding , he called out " God Save the Queen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who screamed themselves hoarse with it , at the same time moving toward the gate , so that the Mayor and the Aldermen of the City were at pains to avoid being swept away by the human tide . Matthew and Joan moved forward with the rest , but the gate was too narrow to admit the multitude efficiently and soon they seemed to be standing dead still with hardly room to breathe . It was then Joan felt a tug at her sleeve and , turning around , saw that it was Esmera . How long the woman had been just at her back Joan could not tell and was half-afraid to wonder . Cannons began thunderingagain . Baroom ! Baroom ! Matthew was facing , doggedly , forward , his eyes fixed on the gate . Joan decided not to call his attention to Esmera 's presence , and to try to ignore the woman herself . But Esmera was insistent ; she tugged again on Joan 's loose , flowing sleeve . Finally , seeing that ignoring the plea for attention was useless , Joan turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explosion and cheering . Her dark eyes implied some new warning . But the crowd suddenly surged ahead , taking Joan with it . A contingent of rowdy apprenticesreleased from their labors for the holiday intervened with laughing , bobbing heads and loud shouts . Matthew steered Joan through the Great Gate , his face still forward while she looked back helplessly at the vanishing figure , a lone dark face amid a host of faces.  |p107At  the first pig booth Matthew and Joan came to  --  not the beastly Ursula 's but one with pretty tablecloths and a decent clientele of merchants and their wives  --  Matthew , having missed his dinner and slighted breakfast , stuffed himself like a gamecock while Joan tried her best to explain about the fortune-teller , whom her husband had caught no glimpse of minutes before and was not pleased to hear mentioned again . Matthew washed down his meat with tepid ale , wiped his mouth upon a napkin , and lectured her on her gullibility . " What did the woman have to say  --  more dire warnings ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hear for the roar . Soon we were carried away . " Her husband 's tone nettled her . " I warrant you it was the price for her services she was trying so hard to communicate , " he said . " I think it was something more serious , " she answered . " She 's at it again then , " Matthew said , motioning to the tapsterfor a refill . " A most persistent creature , this Esmera . Drummingup business with dreadful omens . Well , if you missed speaking for the multitude , I 'd call it good luck . I supposed you had given up this silliness . The woman is a fraud . It 's as plain as the nose on your face . " Joan began to protest that it was not so plain . She did not like this cynical vein in her husband and was not accustomed to it , for she had always found him an open-minded man , ready to give the strange and not readily explained the benefit of doubt . Had he not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she called them  --  the unbeckoned visions that from time to time in her life had betokened bothp108the evil and the good ? Or had his respect for her own gifts been only seeming tolerance for an addled female he must not censure , for she was his wife ? Men ! For a moment she contemplateda world without them , then came back to reality again . Matthew was continuing his diatribe against Esmera , so strongly worded as though the woman had already her hands in his own pocket . He had never seen her , but he knew her kind  --  given to a devilish eloquence , cunning and subtle insinuations . Joan realized that it would do no good to argue further . It was n't , after all , that she really needed her husband 's approval . She was a free-born woman , was she not ? No puling wife harnessed to her husband 's wagon . She had visited Esmera by herself when she was neglected because Matthew would go on another hour with his friend . She decided to visit Esmera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and no household to manage . Why should n't she , if it was her will ? Matthew , seeing no further opposition to his counsel , went on to another topic . Husband and wife finished their meal . Then Matthew said , " Peter will be all in a stew with me gone from the Close . He 's such an earnest , conscientious fellow , God save him , and as straight as a candle in a socket . I must return to the Close . Will you come with me ? Here , you 're finished . What time of the day must it be ? " She said she would not return to the Close ; rather icily she said it . " Will you go back to the Hand and Shears ? I should accompanyyou " I can look out for myself , " she said . " Go to the Close . You said yourself just now that Peter will be at sixes and sevens without you . Go to the Close ; look to your cloth . " " You will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting an eyebrow of suspicion . " But not to this Esmera , this moun-tebank ? " Now , she thought , he was being too overbearing with her . " If I will , husband , I shall , " she replied shortly , her hackles up.  | " What , am I a dewy-eyed calf that must be tethered to a post or ever in sight of its mother ? " " Surely not , I only meant  --  " " Your meaning was plain , Matthew , and I like it not . " She held her peace with that determined look that brooked no impediments , while he explained with a worried expression that he had no wish to restrain her liberty . She was free to go and come as she pleased . If it was her pleasure to reject his counsel , which he had provided only for her good , then he would rest content . He forced a smile of conciliation and reached over to kiss her cheek , trying to mitigate her rising indignation with a merry countenance . She permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was resolved she would not be tethered or restrained , parented in her grandmotherly years , nor have her own good reasons belittled by a man 's counsel  --  even if the man was her husband . " Godspeed , then , " he said . " Godspeed to you , Matthew . " " When will I see you again ? " " Later . I 'll come to the Close . Watch for me . " He said he would , and she moved away  --  like a river lighter pushing off from the pier to join the larger traffic in the stream  --  and was presently lost in the crowd . With rising excitement , she maneuvered among man , beast , and gear , trying to recall exactly where the fortune-teller 's tent was situated among the lanes of booths and stalls . But everythingappeared different now  --  now that the fair had begun and Smithfield swarmed and roared with beating drums , bugles , and the hoarse cries of sellers in the fierce competition to be heard . " Buy , buy , buy , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own goods and decrying their neighbors ' . Realizing she was lost , she stopped in the midst of the current , feeling the pressure of movement at her back and the murmur of complaint when she became an impediment to it , for all seemed to move now in the same general directionp110toward a distant drumbeat signaling , she supposed , an exhibitionof dancing dogs , a freak of nature , or a puppet show . She moved out of the way and found herself next to a shabby costermongerwith a basket of pears in one arm and his other extendedwith a sample of the globular fruit in hand , offering it to the crowd . " Pears , pears , fresh and sweet , " he cried in a rasping voice . He was an old man , toothless , with a savage scar across his forehead . " Please , I am looking for the fortune-teller . Esmera . " The costermonger turned at her voice and prepared to give her the ear ; she was forced to ask her question again . " A fortune-teller , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one at Bartholomy Fair , " he declared in a cranky old man 's voice , blasting her with the fetid breath of rotting gums . " Her name is Esmera , " Joan explained , pronouncing the foreign-soundingname slowly and deliberately . When it was obviousthe name meant nothing to the old man , Joan described the tent . " Stars , you say ? An image of the heavens ? " The costermongernodded and scratched his chin thoughtfully . He said he thought he knew of such a woman after all . He had passed such a tent as Joan had described within the hour . Had sold five or six of his pears there to this same woman 's patrons , glad to have a sweet , succulent pear of the sort he carried in his basket . The pennies he had received for them were still palm-warm in his purse . " And where was this tent ? " Joan asked , impatient with the old man 's prattle . The costermonger shrugged and shuffled his feet , staring down to the little leather bladder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She bought two of the pears , and the old man took her money and raised his head like a dog sniffing at the wind , looking all about him . He pointed up a lane of stalls Joan had not yet explored . But Joan was doubtful . The two pears she had purchased as a price for her information looked neither sweet nor succulent , and the way he had shown her to Esmera'sp111tent seemed not at all familiar . And yet what was she to do ? If Esmera 's tent was not where he said , then she would give over her search . She would return to the Close , grant her husband his share of wisdom , and allow God to determine her fate and his . This lane was occupied by sellers of candies , toys , and cheap souvenirs hawked from rickety booths made of slender poles with ragged canvas tops . Joan saw a great many children in the lane ( to one of whom she gave the pears gratis ) and an equal number of laborers , idle riffraff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly girls of their own age in muslin caps and aprons like milkmaids . Joan passed resolutely by the candy and the toys , the pretty wooden figurines and the samplers with pious sayings , the bottles of colored glass and the bewildering assortment of geegaws fetched from as far away as Poland or Moscovy . On another occasion these things might have caught her attention for a moment , but today she had no leisure . She ignored the invitations to buy extended by the sellers , who recognized in this little woman in velvet hood and cape a person of means ; she ignored them still when the invitations turned to insults at her indifference . They called her " mistress nose-in-the-air " and " mistress high-and-mighty , " and she blushed with shame and embarrassment as she became the object of ridicule of both the sellers and their customers , whose heads turned to look upon every new thing and who were as pleased to stare at Joan as at the bull with the fifth leg or the boy with the man-size pizzle . How she wished again she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How she wished she was back in Chelmsford , where her reputation and person were secure . She was at the point of retreat when she glimpsed what she sought  --  the familiar shape and gaudy hue of a tent only a few yards ahead where the lane of stalls came to an end in an expanse of field.  |p112She  pushed on , jostled by the crowd , and a sudden opening of the way revealed her journey 's end . There it stood . The signin front boldly declared the owner 's name and profession . The mystical symbols on the tent confirmed it . Before the tent , a small company had gathered and had arranged themselves in an orderly file , attracted , Joan supposed , by a curiosity as powerful as her own . The line began a few paces from Esmera 's tent flap and extendedtwenty feet or more along the bank of a ditch of brackish water . Conducting Esmera 's patrons in and out was a scrawny little man in a sweat-stained jerkin that appeared just snatched from some ragpicker 's cart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking pennies , smilingand bowing  --  with much ostentation and ridiculous ceremony that was the source of some amusement among the crowd . In his duties he was assisted by a wretched boy , so pale and thin he was the very image of ravaged mortality , who scrambled up and down the line exhorting those waiting to be patient , assuring them that the wise woman would converse with them all , and warning them against falling backward into the ditch whose bank , he declared in a high-pitched , whiny voice , was exceedingly treacherous . Joan found the stench of the ditch almost beyond endurance and wondered that other of Esmera 's patrons could brave both it and the heat of the day , but those in line seemed indifferent to both sources of discomfort . A mixture of condition and sex , they stood quietly facing the tent door or with backsides to the ditch , conversing among themselves with the familiarity of old acquaintances . She was not surprised when , joining the line a few moments later , she discovered that the matter of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood than Joan had ever supposed . In front of her was a stout , goose-faced housewife wearing a dark purple smock with stains beneath the arms like halfmoons . She was girded with a crisp white apron and although her face was red and moist , she seemed more than content to be where she was . The woman turned to regard Joan with an ingratiating smile and began to praise Esmera . " Worth everyp113penny , " exulted the housewife , nodding with the self-assurance of one who knows a bargain when she sees it . " She told my cousin all that she did as a child , then prophesied that she would find riches at her door . Within a fortnight all came true ! " The woman 's voice dropped to a confidential whisper and her gray eyes bulged . " Her own brother , not seen in five years or more , came tripping home from sea , him all full of coin and silver baubles he had from Spaniards with whom he had crossed swords . The family is nigh unto wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan thought the woman 's reasoning hid a fundamental error ; for even if Esmera foresaw the future in a patron 's palm , was she due thanks for shaping it ? But Joan kept her reservations to herself and the housewife hugged her aproned belly selfprotectivelyand smiled with glee in contemplation of her cousin 's wealth . The woman 's neighbor , a plainly dressed girl with a scarf on her head , had overheard this exchange and now joined in the conversation . She confirmed the impression of Esmera that Joan had just received from the housewife . Esmera was indeed a wonder . Her prophecies were the talk of the town . In the readingof palms she was as skillful as Drake or some other great captain in steering the straits and uncharted waters of the future . And all in the human palm ! Those lines , wrinkles , bumps , crevices of pink flesh ! The girl tugged at her scarf and said she did not mind waiting in the line , although she confessedof once nearly slipping backward into the ditch ( and had she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the scum ! ) . The line was not half the length she feared it would be . Her confidence in Esmera was unshaken . She hoped the wise woman would help her choose between the two young men vying for her affections . But the line did advance slowly , Joan thought as the afternoonwaned and the chatter of her neighbors in the line grew tedious . She began to have second thoughts about her quarrel with Matthew . Had he been right all along ? Was she beingp114manipulated by a clever schemer  --  a guller of the ignorant who knew subtle ways to arouse curiosity and instill fear ? Joan was in a good mind to leave , to return to the Close as she had promised . But she had invested so much time waiting . There was her pride too . No mere thing , that ! She decided to wait . The sight of a familiar face at the tent door now caught her attention . How could she not have recognized that long , tallow-faced figure in the same suit he had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greengrocer . She wondered she had not seen him there , then decided he had paid someone to hold his place in line . But it was certainly Pullyver . There could not be two in London so alike . Pullyver was walking in her direction , skirting the edge of the line , and somewhat furtive in expression . When he was about to pass Joan , apparently without seeing her , she called out his name . " Mr. Pullyver , a very good afternoon to you , sir . " The greengrocer stopped at the sound of his name and looked her up and down quite impertinently . He did not seem to recognize her , and Joan found this nettling . Obnoxious man , was she that common that he did not remember having conversed with her less than twenty-four hours before ? She decided to revenge herself for this slight of her person . Meanwhile , Pullyver continued to regard her , taking in the velvet hood and cape , the handsome jewel on her marriage finger , the gown of a woman of some means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's thinking in his face . His expression softened ; he assumed an air of politeness and spoke her fair . " Good day to you , mistress . Taking the air of Smithfield , I see . Delighted to see you . . . again . " Pullyver 's expression remained perplexed . His manner was awkward . And for a moment the thought passed through her mind that the greengrocer knew very well who she was and for some obscure reason was pretending forgetfulness . " I see you have been inquiring of the prophetess , " she said.  | " Oh , she , " Pullyver said dismissively , casting a glance back at the tent from which he had just emerged . " Yes , just a little matter regarding the disposition of my goods . Where to place this vegetable or that fruit  --  all to breed the better commerce . A man of business looks out for every opportunity to improve himself . " " Oh , indeed he does , " Joan agreed , smiling broadly . " Especiallyone in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she noted the furious blush on Pullyver 's face at her remark about the wife  --  " to satisfy a whim of my husband 's . " She savored the irony of this innocent falsehood . Whim of her husband 's indeed ! But why was Pullyver really here ? She held him with her chatter . He seemed eager to be gone . But after a few minutes her inventory of casual topics had been exhausted . " Well , I really must be off , " he said , tipping his hat . " Business elsewhere . So hot here in the sun . And the stench from yonder bank ! " The greengrocer made a face of disgust and raised a handkerchief filled with pomander to his nostrils . " Give my regards to your good husband . " " I shall , I shall , " said Joan , smiling slyly and replying to his courtesy with a bow of her own . She watched Pullyver until he reached the end of the line and then turned up the lane of candy sellers , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joan recognized the woman too . It was Ned Babcock 's somber daughter , her mourning garments sharply contrasting with the gay attire of most of the holidaymakers . The pair exchanged some words and then went on together . How Joan would like to have been privy to that conversation ! She wondered what the both of them were up to , for indeed they seemed up to some intrigue , although she could not imagine what it was . But now she had moved up closer to the tent and her heart began to beat with anticipation . The girl with the scarf went in and came out again , all within a very short time , and yet what/ever Esmera had said to her had obviously pleased her greatly , for she came out grinning from ear to ear and wished Joan good day . Now Joan 's turn had come at last . She paid her penny to the little doorman and he lifted the tent flap . She went in . Esmera was seated as before . Her hands with their long bejeweledfingers entwined rested upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slightly bent in the pose of an anchorite . She was wearing her hooded robe and Joan wondered how she could endure it . The heat in the tent was stifling . Esmera looked up and recognized Joan . " I wanted to speak to you at the gate , " Joan said , " but I could n't hear you for all the noise . What 's the message you have for me ? It 's something terrible , is it ? Something more about my husband and me ? " Esmera 's expression , a mixture of pity and fear , confirmed Joan 's worst suspicions . It was something dreadful , and it did have something to do with Matthew and her . " Please sit down , Mrs. Stock . " , Joan was more than ready to sit down . The heat had made her faint and the growing anxiety in her bosom was also workingto undo her . She sat down on the stool opposite Esmera and fixed her eyes on the woman . The expression on that strangely exotic face softened and became sympathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " A vision ? " " Of death . " Joan 's heart sank . She beat down an urge to flee . But she knew she must remain . " Whose ? " Joan asked , afraid to learn but knowing the questionmust be asked , yes and answered too . Esmera leaned forward and stared at Joan intently . " You are in graver danger than I supposed before , Mrs. Stock , " she whisperedconspiratorily , her long face made somewhat pale by the intensity of her concentration.  | " So you said when last we met , " Joan said . " I came because I thought you might explain from what quarter the threat of death would come . Your expression in the crowd convinced me you had perceived some more certain danger than before . " " Ah , and so I have . " " And that danger is . . . " Esmera closed her eyes ; her head began to sway from side to side ; she was lost in some trance , all the while making a soft crooning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to decipher the lines in the flesh by touch alone . Then the crooning and swaying stopped and Esmera opened her eyes and seemed to stare at something in the middle distance . Joan sat transfixed , her heart beating at an accelerated rhythm . She was half-sick ; her clothing clung to her ; and yet she knew nothing could make her leave now . She must find out what Esmera knew . " Who was it you saw in your vision ? " she repeated urgently , unable to endure longer the suspense . " I see a body of a dead man , " Esmera said in a faraway voice . " I can not see his face , only his shape . I see his murderer too . And the weapon with which the deed was done . " " Weapon ? It was no beast then ? " " Oh , it is a beast indeed . The worst of beasts . The most malign of God 's creatures . The only beast that will kill its own kind when its belly 's full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph in his crime . He laughs at his victim . He thinks himself very clever , and the worst of it is that he is clever indeed . The body of his victim is discovered but no one suspects the cause of death  --  no one save one . " " Who ? " " Your husband . " " But you said there was a weapon ? " Joan blurted . " Surely the cause of death would be evident to all . " " I see the weapon , " Esmera repeated solemnly . " A blade , long and very sharp . The murderer is clever . He has killed but the crime goes undetected . How , you ask ? How is this done ?  |p118An  excellent subterfuge . The murder seems to be the work of another . The death lies at another 's door . The murderer lives to kill again . " " What of the dead man ? Who is he ? " Esmera shook her head . " I can not tell . " " Why not ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face is concealed . " " And the murderer ? " Esmera shut her eyes again ; a slow grim smile traveled across her face . " I see the murderer walk behind his victim . I see him reach for the long , pointed blade . Out it is drawn from its place of concealment , like an eel slithering from a clump of marsh grass . It is thrust in and again . " Esmera made a grimace of anguishas she repeated the phrase . Her body convulsed in dumb show of the vision ; her eyes rolled up into her head , flashing their whites while the pupils grew small . Aghast at this manifestation , Joan could make no reply . Shortly , the fortuneteller'sfit'ended , and Joan was able to catch her breath . " Surely this is murder plain and simple , " she said in a tremblingvoice . " It 's impossible to think it would not be recognized as murder . " " The murderer is a devil , as I have said . I see these jabs so violent and fatal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound made of man . Only raw , exposed flesh and bone where the dead man has been devoured . " " Devoured ! First slain , then eaten . Awful to think of ! " Joan quickly worked through the bloody scene in her imaginationwhile Esmera , tranquil now , seemed to slide into anothertrance . Surely , this was a beast , this murderer of which the fortune-teller spoke . Foisting off on some dumb brute beast the blame for his own crime ! But the victim ! Who was the victim ? Was it the poor wretch of the muckhill or some other yet to be ? She hurled the question at Esmera , but so deep and imperturbable was her trance that Joan was forced to wait until the fortune-teller emerged from it . Minutes passed ; Joan 's imaginationconjured up horrible scene after horrible scene  --  all ofp119which involved her husband . Now she was beset by grief and guilt as well as horror . Oh , Matthew ! How sorry she was now that she had rankled at his counsel . Were his admonishments so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Was he the one whom the murderer would strike next ? Or was it Joan herself ? " If it is my husband whose body you see , tell me , for Jesus ' sake . Who is it that lies dead and bloody ? " As if in response to Joan 's appeal , Esmera opened her eyes at last . Her dark pupils enlarged , glistening with a cold , dispassionateacceptance of fate , and Joan felt that acquiescence to what could not be changed was being forced on her . Then Esmera answered the question slowly and deliberately . " I can see no face , only the terrible wound . At least I can not see now . Perhaps on another time the vision will be clearer , fuller . But this I can truly say , Mrs. Stock  --  you and your husband are in grave danger here . Take my advice and go home . Go home to Chelmsford . Go home before it is too late . " " Was there not more in your vision ? " Joan asked quietly . Esmera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of you both . " " Dear God ! " Joan exclaimed , deciding she could stand no more . She stood , jarring the table while Esmera looked on calmly . " Blessed Christ , make it not so . " She turned and without another word to the cunning-woman pushed aside the tent flap and emerged into the open air . She nearly collided with the penny-gatherer and trod upon the feet of Esmera 's next customer ; she mumbled an apology to them both and hurried on . By the time she reached the bottom of the toy sellers ' lane , her stride had become a steady jog that provoked more than one surly complaint from those she elbowedand jostled in her panic and once , at least , the cry of " Stop , thief , " from one sure that no honest motive could so propel the little woman through such a throng.  |p120Arriving  breathless at the Close , Joan found Matthew gone from the booth , which was attended only by Peter Bench , still reading his book of poems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw how distressed she was and put the book aside . She did not endeavor to explain ; it was all too complicated . She asked where her husband had gone and Peter told her he had gone to the bear garden some few minutes before . She felt another lump of anguish rise in her throat . Without thanking Peter for this information or indeed saying another syllable , she was off again , caring nothing for the spectacleshe was making of herself , darting around like a startled hare . At the bear garden , at which she arrived within ten minutes of leaving the Close and not without considerable difficulty for the crowds , she was dismayed to see another long line waiting to pay and get in , as though nothing could be seen or done at the fair but one must form a line to do it . She scanned every face and did not see Matthew . She concluded he must be inside already . Francis Crisp was taking admission at the gate . She ran up to him to ask where Matthew was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pass ahead yourself , Mrs. Stock . Do n't bother about paying . Compliments of the house . " Inside the noisy bear garden she found the tiers of seats alreadyfull and standing room only below , where the view of the proceedings was the poorest , blocked by hats and shoulders moving about in a constant stir . She insinuated herself amid the bodies until she arrived at the paling separating the spec/tators from the pit itself , ignoring the slurs upon her character from every side for her boldness . She looked all around , above , and below , in the tiers . Her vision blurred . A dozen faces she spotted might have been Matthew'sbut hats concealed faces and some faces were turned from her in the direction of the bear 's tent . The crowd was clamoring for the bearbaiting to begin . Braces of hounds , soon to be in combat with Samson , joined the uproar . She realized it was hopeless . She prayed Matthew was here and safe , but how could she be sure until she saw him with her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murderer of whom Esmera had spoken and in whose existence Joan now believed beyond doubt . A trumpet blared somewhere behind her  --  a long , elegant flourish that , concluding , provoked a mighty cheer of approval from the throng who understood this was the signal for the contest to begin . In the center of the pit Ned Babcock now appeared , smiling proudly and holding his arms aloft as a gesture of silence to the noisy crowd . When the clamor lessened  --  silence was too much to ask of such a rout  --  Babcock spoke . He welcomed the spectators to his pit , which he called the Smithfield Bear Gardens , its more elegant title , and referred to those present as " good gentles " and " honored and distinguished guests everyone " as though he was speaking to the cream of society and not to as great a hodgepodge of every condition of man and woman as Joan had ever seen . Most were already drunken and had been so since midday , for the great heat had caused enormous consumption of every kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperiled by the general atmosphere of holiday misrule . Nonetheless Babcock paid them more than their due . He made a very low bow to the tiers and another to those standing and then said they should all presently witness a spectacle of ursine puissance not to be matched at the bear gardens of Southwark or by other famous bears of the town he then proceeded to name.  |p122This  boast provoked many a cynical guffaw and denial from the impatient crowd . Meanwhile the dogs , who had been confinedin a small enclosure in front of Joan , began to bark and whine so that Babcock 's final remarks before disappearing into Samson 's tent were completely lost on the crowd . These same dogs had been raised to such a pitch of excitement by the humannoise and the smell of the bear that they now were practicallybeyond the control of their keepers . They began to fight with each other , and their keepers were at great trouble to separatethe most belligerent of them ; at last one of the animals , a particularly scrappy little spaniel , was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unfit to fight the bear and had to be removed . Meanwhile Joan , only vaguely aware of these happenings and caring less , continued to search for her husband in the crowd . Her searching was by eye alone , for she was unable to move from where she stood . It was not therefore that she could have done anything had she seen him . But just seeing him , and seeing him whole , would have been sufficient at this moment , for she had a terrible fear that somehow he had been swallowed up in the multitude and she should have to go back to Chelmsford alone with not even his dead body for company . The quarreling dogs had caused a delay in the proceedings . But their owners had now regained control and still the bear did not appear . The crowd began to boo and hiss and presently Francis Crisp came out of the tent and made motions for them to be quieter . His efforts were futile ; the uproar increased . Crisp went back inside the tent . A moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was Samson , who was wagging his shaggy head and thrusting his nose forward in the air to sniff out the scent of the dogs . At the appearance of Samson the crowd 's boos turned into cheers . Crisp chained the bear to the tethering stake and as if on cue Samson rose to his hind-legs and stood manlike , pawing the air as though saluting the assembly  --  like an old Romanp123gladiator about to give mortal battle . " It 's no wonder he could kill a man , " someone said near to Joan , by which she understood the word had spread about the dead man . Joan felt yet another chill of apprehension . She futilely stared about her in a renewed effort to find Matthew . A short , thickset man in a loose-fitting shirt led his dogs forward and unleashed them one by one , so that each animal sprang forward into a position just beyond the extent of the bear 's swing . The crowd roared . Samson glared at the dogs with his small eyes and then took a mighty swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of its head and sending it flying to within a few feet of the paling . While the dog lay stunned by the blow , his confederates now joined the attack , and in the fray that followed Joan could not hear the sound of dog or bear for the boisterous enthusiasm of the crowd for this bloody spectacle . Samson was now on his hind feet , pawing the air threateningly , bellowing and flailing at the attackingdogs . One spaniel , more courageous than the rest , attackedthe bear directly and for a moment hung upon his chest , his teeth fastened into the thick fur , until Samson caught the creature in a hug that crushed the dog 's spine , then let him drop at his feet . In the meantime the other dogs were circling , snarling , and lunging , alert for any part of the bear 's anatomy that they might attack with impunity . Their fangs were bare and dripping with saliva , their eyes intense . The bear swung round and round , letting fly with his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with a threateningsuddenness . Samson caught one dog on the side of the head and sent him sprawling into the dust , his head a bloody pulp . The bear shredded the fur from another 's back and broke the forelegs of a third , before the remaining attackers , recognizing the superiority of bear to dog despite their numbers , began to lose enthusiasm for the fight . Scampering over the bodies of their fallen kennel mates , they went whimpering back to their crestfallen master , who gave the bloodied survivors a few good kicks for their pains.  |p124The  conclusion of the fight brought frenzied applause from all sides as onlookers scrambled to collect their winnings , which evidently were based on both the winner of the combat  --  bear or dog  --  and on the extent of the destruction  --  three dogs fallen out of the brace of half dozen who had commenced the attack . But Joan thought the whole spectacle the most disgustingshe had ever witnessed . The fight confirmed what she had long believed : that here was the most abominable of sports for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she was for Matthew 's safety and disgusted at the spectacle before her , she was now forced to stand as witness to this carnage while God only knew what mortal mischief her husband might be subject to , assuming as she did that he was somewhere within the confinesof the bear garden . While bear and hound tore at each other with tooth and nail to the delight of the multitude , Joan could think only of the deadly blade so vividly described in Esmera 's vision , a vision enacted for her again every time one of the drunken louts she was wedged between jabbed an elbow in her ribs or shoved her from behind in the general excitement . It was with great relief , then , nearly an hour later , that she heard the trumpet sound the conclusion of the baiting . The crowd began to disperse . Now she was at pains not to be trampledas the unruly lot rushed toward the narrow gate , pushing and shoving , even more quarrelsome after the excitement of the baiting than before and all eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wine seller 's booth . She had passed through the gate herself and was standing about helplessly , not knowing where to search next for Matthew , when Francis Crisp , coming up from behind her , tapped her on the shoulder and gave her the benefit of his horsey grin . " And how , Mrs. Stock , did you and your good husband enjoy the baiting ? Tell me , did not Samson give those curs their due ? They 're a bloody chastened lot of dogs now , I tell you . " Joan interrupted Crisp 's review of Samson 's exploits by informinghim that she had never found her husband.  | " Not found him ! Well , and no wonder with such a multitude . But I saw him enter just minutes before your arrival . Perhapshe 's gone to speak to Ned . " Joan thanked Crisp for this information and hurried back insidethe pit . Here she found a few stragglers arguing about the baitings and a dog owner nursing one of his wounded charges . She walked toward Samson 's tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear 's cage . Samson was at work licking his wounds , several savage rents in his thick coat . Matthew and the bearward were in such earnest conversation that neither noticed her approach . " Thank God you 're safe , husband , " Joan said . " Safe enough , " Matthew replied , turning to receive her embrace , but appearing very solemn-faced . Joan was about to blurt out her report of Esmera 's latest warnings when her husband interrupted her . " There 's been yet another murder , " he said . Startled at finding her own worse fears realized , she could only stare back at her husband , and then at Ned Babcock . The bearward nodded his head in agreement . " Murder for a fact . There 's no denying it , " said the bearward.  |p126Samson  , in his cage , made slurping noises with his tongue as he licked his wounds . Ned repeated the story he had just told to Matthew while Joan listened , her heart in her throat . " It 's Jack ... Jack Talbot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short gasps as though winded . " He 's a wine seller ... his booth is nearby . I found what 's left of him . . . in a pile of muck . 0 Lord ! Just behind the tent . The baiting was over . I had gone out with a shovelful of bloody straw  --  could n't find Gabriel my helper anywhere . A flyblown corpse is Jack now , God pity him . Skewered in a dozen places and with cruel slashes on his forehead . A devil 's work to be sure , Mrs. Stock , as I just finished telling your husband . " Ned 's eyes filled with tears ; his face was pale ; his large body trembled . Matthew asked , " Have you sent word to the Justice ? " " Not yet , " he replied . " There was n't time . I just found the body , not a minute before you entered . Good God , what bad luck for us all . " " Especially for the wine seller , " Joan observed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " Ned asked Matthew . " I should n't think so . But the authorities will have to be told . And the sooner the better . Maybe , in the meantime , I should have a look at the body . " The bearward nodded his agreement , then looked with concernat Joan . " It 's an ugly thing , Mrs. Stock , not fit for a woman to see . " Joan was sure it was no pretty sight , but having endured an afternoon of carnage she was positive another glimpse of blood and mutilation could do little damage to her already **25;14550;TOOLONG . Besides , she did n't want to be left out of an inquiry in which she had come to feel personally involved . The dead man was a stranger to her , but she felt in her heart it might have been her husband whose brutalized corpse she was about to view . Ned led the way out the back of the tent and round a corner to a narrow alley separating the booths facing one lane from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter and garbage from the booths . As soon as she entered it , the fetid odor of decay assaulted her nostrils and made her recoil with disgust . She saw a pile of refuse partly covered with a raggedy tarpaulin . She stood close to her husband as Ned reached down and pulled the tarpaulin back , revealing the dead body of the wine seller . He was sprawled face down on a mound of stale , crusted ordure and trash as though it were a great teat he was sucking on . His filthy bloodstained jerkin showed where a weapon with sharp point had punctured the flesh , time and time again . A wave of nausea passed over her , made worse by the grip of dread around her heart . It was Esmera 's vision come true , the vindication of the fortune-teller 's powers . Joan turned her eyes from the scene , struggling against the urge to run . " That 's how I found him , Matthew , " Ned said . " I did n't move him at all . I saw at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With his hat in his hand in an attitude of respect , Ned Babcockpronounced his words slowly and deliberately , as though composing an epitaph . Joan braced herself for another view of the body and turned slowly . Her husband was kneeling down by the pile . His face was very pale and glistened with sweat . His presence hardly disturbed the legion of flies that crawled upon the corpse and buzzed madly in the air around it . The three were now joined by Francis Crisp , who had come looking for his partner and had heard voices in the alley . He wore a grin of satisfaction on his long face that vanished as soon as he perceived what it was that had drawn them into the narrow alley.  | " God 's blood , who 's that ? " he said , his jaw falling slack . " Jack Talbot , " muttered Babcock with a heavy sigh . " He 's been murdered . " " Murdered ! " Crisp said , stepping backward and crossing himself . " You 'd better go fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Babcock said to his partner . " Tell him a dead man 's been found . Tell him too that our Samson had no part of it . As Crisp ran off in compliance with this direction , Joan watched as Matthew gently turned the body of the wine seller onto its back . She suppressed a cry of horror as she saw the dead man 's forehead . " Jesus in heaven ! " exclaimed her husband . " I 've seen that mark before . " The dead man 's countenance was curiously peaceful despite the filth that covered his face and the painful manner of his dying . But on his forehead were rust-colored streaks of dried blood radiating outward in a fan from a point between his brows , as though some beast had placed his claw upon his forehead , tearing the flesh to the bone with his nails . Joan remembered Matthew 's description of a similar mark on the forehead of the murdered puppet master . " It is the very same mark , to the life , " Matthew said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , with the same weapon  --  stolen from the puppet master 's sheath . A poniard . The murderercarried it off , just as I had supposed . " " The murders were committed by the same hand , then , " Joan asserted . " How could it be otherwise ? Here 's a grisly signature ! " Matthewsaid . " Poor miserable creature . Done after he was already dead  --  like the puppet master . A mark of vengeance or a crazed mind . Perhaps both . " Matthew left Jack Talbot lying face upward . He tried to brush away the flies , but it was futile . He pulled the tarpaulin back over the body and quietly explained to Ned Babcockp129about the grisly murder on the London road near Chelmsford less than a week before . Babcock listened with interest . He seemed eager for any facts that might serve to disassociate himselfor his bear from the death of the wine seller . " Your bear wo n't be blamed for this , " Matthew said reassuringly . " But the finding of the corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baynard . That 's two dead men in as many days . " Babcock heaved another sigh and rubbed the moisture from his ruddy face . He resembled a chastened schoolboy in his stance . Joan noticed the wheelbarrow was not about and remarked on it . " It 's Gabriel 's , is n't it ? Was it not his duty to carry off the refuse ? Should n't he have found the corpse himself ? " Babcock made a perplexed face and then said , " I ca n't find him . I have n't seen him since before the baiting . It is his duty to keep Samson 's quarters clean , as well as feed and water him . He carries the dung to the muckhill twice a day , in the morning and then again after suppertime . I 'm in for a heavy fine from the Smithfield beadles if I 'm caught allowing this muck to collect here . He should have moved it all in the wheelbarrow . That 's his job . Now , you do n't suppose he did this , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the handsome , well-built young man flashed through her mind . The imagewas followed by that of the slim , dark-haired servant of Ursula the pig-woman , and Joan shuddered . If Gabriel were the murderer , never had a murderer 's face showed less guile or menace . Was it possible ? If it was , Joan worried for Rose Dibble . But her husband was already considering the possibility . " He was only recently employed by you ? " Matthew asked Babcock . " Yes . When Simon Plover was kill  --  " Ned Babcock stopped in midsentence , flushed , then continued hurriedly , " Disappeared , I mean . You see , he vanished in thin air . Then this Gabriel Stubbs showed up and said he was out at elbow and needed employment . He seemed like a sturdy and dependablep130lad , a deep thinker too and religious , which things Simon never had been  --  what with his drinking and wenching . So when Simondisappeared , I hired Gabriel . " " Not disappeared , " said Matthew in a sudden inspiration triggeredby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , as you started to say just now . It was Simon Plover whose leg and foot were found yesterday in the middenheap , was n't it ? " The bearward made no response to the charge , but his slumped shoulders and fallen expression acknowledged the truth he had tried to conceal . An awkward silence followed , then he said : " The hose Simon wore were once mine . I gave them to him out of simple charity . He patched them himself and wore them always since they were all the simple fellow had . I recognizedwhat was left of them , knew it was Simon who had been eaten . Samson was already in bad repute for my son-in-law 's death . I lied to protect the bear . " " And your business , " Joan added , rather severely . The bearward admitted it was true . He was not a rich man , he said defensively , regarding Matthew as though to suggest that some in the present company were and that therefore they should be charitable to those less fortunate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear garden . If this venture failed , it would be the last in a line of failed ventures . His creditors , his investors , Pullyver and Chapman , would take everything . He regarded Matthew with a look of desperation . " It is very likely Simon was murdered before he was eaten , " Matthew said . " Possibly murdered by your present helper , Gabriel Stubbs . " Matthew suggested they have a look at where Gabriel slept and among his personal possessions . Ned Babcock led the way back into the tent . He showed them the corner where there was a simple pallet covered by a coarse homespun blanket . A worn leather pack was propped up against a hogshead of water that the bear drank of . Matthew opened the pack and emptied its contents on the pallet . There was an extra shirt , an old pair of hose , and a greasy jerkin . There was also a pen and ink and a tablet of foolscap.  |p131Matthew  said , " This Gabriel came to work for you the day your previous helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good luck to find a dependable lad in place of a lout . Gabriel is from the north country . His speech betrays that . He must have come down from Norwich or thereabouts , passed through Chelmsford , and then on his way to London . The puppet master , seeing so goodly a young man afoot , offers him a ride , for which mercy Gabriel Stubbs kills him and gives him the beast 's mark as a memento . Steals , then , the puppet master 's horse and his poniard . With the horse he makes for Smithfield . With the poniard he has killed the wine seller , for what reason God only knows , but we shall discover for ourselveswith patience and industry . He probably sold the horse when he arrived at Smithfield  --  that would be no difficult task , Smithfield being as it is the best of markets for horseflesh . Somewhere he must have met this servant of yours  --  at a tavernperhaps , or a brothel . Maybe he was interested in the bear . Maybe he had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them quarreled over the reckoning or a girl . London is a cold city for strangers . " To Joan these speculations now began to sound too rich in her husband 's fancy although she was still marveling at his shrewd guess at the dead man 's identity . She understood how the boy might kill the puppet master . A horse was worth something  --  fivepounds if in good condition , at least an easier journeyto London . But why kill Simon , lazy lout and scoundrel though he may have been ? She could hardly believe anyone would kill just to have a place in a filthy bear pit . Matthew was picking his way through the straw of the bed , raking it with his fingers , an expression of intense concentration on his face . " What 's this  --  a treasure ? " It was n't a treasure . It was a penny pamphlet like those sold in the bookstalls , much dog-eared and besmirched from handling . Matthew read the title aloud : " A Faithful Discoverie of the Sundrie Shapes in Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer reading , I warrant . "  |p132Matthew  flipped through the pages , reading silently . " His book ? " Joan inquired . " It could n't have been Simon 's , " Ned remarked . " Not the religious type . Besides , he could n't read . " " Stem Puritan warnings about the Evil One  --  an inventory of satanic manifestations , " Matthew said , keeping his eyes on the rumpled pages . " This Gabriel is evidently a scholar . All the margins are written upon . See here . " He held the page open so that Joan and Ned could read too . " Here , for example . The author mentions the Beast of the Apocalypse . And next in the margin someone  --  this Gabriel doubtless  --  has written , Verily , I have seen this shape myself and can testify that it is so . ' And here , on this page is a drawing of the very Beast described in the sacred text . He 's not much of an artist , I 'd say . " Joan took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes she saw the crude drawing of a fantastic creature , with immense glaring eyes , wings , horns , and large paws . " I 've never seen such a creature under God 's heaven . " " The boy affirms that he has , " Matthew remarked dryly . Babcock took a look for himself . He said he had never seen such a beast  --  and hoped not to  --  although he added that he meant no disrespect for Sacred Writ . Then he said , " The feet resemble Samson 's . Look at them . They 're bear claws , right enough . " Both Matthew and Joan took another look . Indeed the feet of the beast did resemble the feet of the bear . In this detail , at least , the drawing was quite faithful . Observation of the originalhad obviously inspired the artist to greater skill . " Bear 's claws . The mark of the beast , " Joan said in an almost reverent whisper . " If this is Gabriel 's book , and all evidence suggests that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murderer , " Matthew said . " A crazed mind , his comely appearance notwithstanding , " Joan added , marveling . Matthew took the book and continued his perusal while thep133others waited for the next discovery . It was not long in coming . " Here is proof positive , " Matthew declared , looking up with a grin of triumph . He turned the book around so Joan and Ned could see for themselves . On the last page of the pamphlet , only half of which was printed upon , an open space had been covered with a crude drawing . It was not a creature but a symbol  --  fivelines drawn from a single point , splayed outward like the prongs of a rake or the claw of a beast . " Gabriel is our man ! " Matthew said . " Thrice a murderer  --  and perhaps a murderer again if not prevented . " Joan looked around the interior of the tent nervously . Where was Gabriel ? Stalking another victim with his poniard , concealeddoubtless in his shirt , its point needle-sharp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and precious pamphlet behind in his flight . Maybe now he was halfway to Plymouth or Norwich ? And yet that did seem unlikely . Had he intended to escape , he would surely have escaped beforehand . No , certainly the pamphlet suggested he had some maniacal mission in his head that , remaining unfulfilled , would keep Gabriel  --  oh , the irony of that angelic name  --  around until his own good time.  |p134Francis  Crisp returned , bringing the Justice , the Clerk , and the sergeant with him . The three men had been apprised of what they would find in the alley and they regarded Ned Babcockand the Stocks with the disapproving look reserved for convicted felons and other unsavory types . Cool greetings were exchanged , then the newcomers and the others went into the alley to see the dead man for themselves . " A wine seller , you say ? " remarked the Clerk , taking his turn at peering beneath the tarpaulin and damning the flies and smell at the same time . " I partly knew the man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his breath . The bearward had come up silently behind the Clerk and looked down at the body . He shook his head sadly . " An honest man , Jack . His booth was not a stone 's throw from here . He was very big with Ursula the pig-woman . " " Oh , that slut . There 's disreputable company , to be sure , " said the Clerk . " Mr. Stock here thinks he knows who did it , " Babcock said , nodding toward Matthew and speaking with the forced confidence of a man who knows his own guilt is yet to be disproven . " Does he ? " answered Justice Baynard , turning to Matthew and regarding him with new interest . " And just what is it you know , sir ? " Joan listened as her husband began a recital of the facts as he now understood them , including a description of the dead puppetmaster whose body had been found near Chelmsford . He added that the peculiar way each body had been marked left little doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that person is  --  ? " prompted the Clerk impatiently.  | " Almost surely it is Mr. Babcock 's helper we seek  --  Gabriel Stubbs , " Matthew said . Matthew now showed the Justice and the Clerk the incriminatingpamphlet with its strange drawings and commentary . The Justice examined the pamphlet and shook his head , agreeing that it was the Devil 's work if ever he saw it . The Clerk also took a look . He said that the curious clawlike figure was the mark of the Beast . He said he would swear to it . " And this same mark was carved in the forehead of the dead man you found in Chelmsford ? " asked the Justice . " What manner of man was this puppet master ? " the Clerk asked Matthew . Matthew described the puppet master to the best of his recollection . The Clerk said he knew the man . " Why , it 's James Fitzhugh ! Many a year he and his little folk have come to BartholomewFair . And now he 's dead ! " The Clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , murdered in cold blood . " Matthew assured the Clerk that the puppet master indeed was dead . Buried too , in Chelmsford churchyard . " And with the same vicious mark etched in his flesh . " " Lord have mercy upon us all , " said the Clerk . But Grotwell cursed and so did Francis Crisp , who had been silent all the while . " Well , Mr. Stock , " Justice Baynard said , regarding Matthew with more respect than before . " You 've done well in discerning all this wickedness and have our thanks for it . As for you , Mr. Babcock , it seems your bear is cleared of blame . At least in this new enormity , for this is clearly human mischief we gaze upon . Now this Puritan Stubbs must occupy our attention . " " But why would Gabriel have killed Jack Talbot ? " Babcock asked with an expression of puzzlement on his great round face . " He must have lain in wait for him in the alley , " conjectured Grotwell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy thrust home . " Grotwell made a sudden violent motion with an imaginaryblade . It was all very dramatic , and the gesture had its effect onp136the others . Joan shuddered at the very thought and could not bring herself to look again at the dead body of the wine seller . " I suspect , rather , that the deed was done inside the tent yonder , " Matthew remarked casually . Grotwell , not pleased at having his own theorizing disputed , frowned at Matthew and wanted to know just how the Chelmsfordconstable had arrived at that conclusion , which seemed to him contradictory to the plain fact that the body lay where it was and the alley , being narrow and private , was as fine a place for murder as any he knew of in Smithfield . " Go on , Mr. Stock . Tell us , " said the Justice , interested . " Well , sir , " said Matthew , addressing his remarks to the Justice . " The dead man 's jerkin is soaked with blood from the wound , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the tent floor is strewn with straw , some of it freshly laid , I have observed . Especially around Samson 's cage . The wine seller might well have come into the tent to have a look at the bear and Stubbs stabbed him while his back was turned . Then Stubbs took pains to clean up the bloody straw so as to remove any evidence of the death  --  perhaps after lugging the body out here , where it would not be seen . Sooner or later he would have disposed of the body the same way he disposed of Simon Plover . " The mention of the former helper brought startled expressions to the faces of nearly all the men present . There was a silence while the Clerk looked at Matthew and then at the Justice . Matthew said , " There was a third victim . Simon Plover , Mr. Babcock 's former helper  --  the one before this Stubbs . Stubbs killed him too and fed his body to the bear . It was Plover 's bloody foot and shank that were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped the Justice . " Do you mean to say  --  " Matthew nodded solemnly . Fortunately for Babcock , the officialswere too dumbstruck by this revelation to care how and when the identification of the body had been made , or to infer from it that Babcock had known the truth from the beginning . Indeed , Matthew 's assertion that Simon Plover had also been ap137victim of the young Puritan was , as Joan well knew , based entirelyupon circumstantial evidence . But the circumstances as now understood pointed all in a single direction : at the guilt of the handsome young man with the soft voice and pleasing eye . " This fellow is mad indeed , " said the Clerk , whose anxious expression suggested he was still obviously working through the grisly scene Matthew 's disclosure had evoked . " If Stubbs thinks his murder has been concealed for the present , he 'll surely return , " observed Justice Baynard . He asked Babcock for a description of his helper and Babcock provided one , not neglecting to mention the young man 's sterling good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " said the Justice . " All Smithfield must be searched . We ca n't assume he 'll return , although he certainly may . " " He wo n't if he thinks we 're waiting for him , " Matthew said . " That 's right , Mr. Stock , " the Justice said . " Well thought of . " The Justice looked around him . He ordered Grotwell to fetch the rest of the watch . Babcock said he thought those presentwould be a match for the boy should he return . They were all still planning what was to be done and who should do it when their attention was diverted by the sound of a railing voice within the tent . Ursula appeared . She was fuming and cursing Grotwell , who had her in tow and who explained over her thunderings that he had found her wandering around in the compound looking for Jack Talbot . Someone had told her he had come to this same bear garden earlier that morning and had not been seen since and indeed had not opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for liquor of every kind as Ursula had seen in twenty years because of the great heat . " Jack is here , beastly woman , " the Justice said scornfully , pointing a finger at the tarpaulin that had been pulled over the body again . Grotwell walked over and lifted the tarpaulin . " What is this ? " Ursula asked gruffly , peering at what the tarpaulinconcealed . " Jack ? " she said , then cried out with anguish.  | " We think it was Gabriel Stubbs who did it , " said the Justice . " Mr. Babcock 's helper . " Ursula straightened up and looked menacingly at Ned Babcock . " The bearward 's helper ! Well , damn his rotten soul , then . " She clinched her jaw and made both hands into fists . Her bosom heaved . " My prophetic soul , if I did n't suspect the whelp from the first day I laid eyes on him . Did he not come round practicing his lechery on my own servant , Rose Dibble , a lazy , idle creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this all has led  --  to the death of poor sweet Jack , who was ever as tender with me as with his own blessed mother . I swear ' fore God it 's all true . " " If this Rose you speak of had anything to do with Stubbs , we should speak to her as well , " said the Justice . He turned to Grotwell . " Go fetch her  --  this Rose Dibble . And do gather your men as before I commanded . " Grotwell went to do what he was told . Ursula said , " Aye , fetch the slimy grasshopper 's thighs , for I will pluck out her eyes and make soup of ' em . " Ignoring this terrible threat , Justice Baynard went on with his instructions . " The hue and cry must be raised , " he said . But the Clerk , a cool head in emergencies , said he wondered about the wisdom of such an action . " Wisdom ? " asked the Justice , amazed that such a practical and seemingly obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crazed fellow will escape  --  and he may kill again . " " Because , sir , " said the Clerk in a calm , steady voice , " if the hue and cry is raised you will create a panic at the fair . The booths all round will be emptied of custom as the fainthearted burghers flee from the alarm of murder . And the deaths will surely be multiplied , as the more villainous use the opportunity to disguise their own crimes of violence . No , sir , the madman must be found indeed  --  for the sake of justice and public safety . But let us not resort to the hue and cry but proceed with discretion and policy . A public announcement will do no more than alarm him and thep139citizenry . Nor would such a ruckus be pleasing to Her Majesty , who all the world knows comes to the fair tomorrow . " Concluding his plea , the Clerk looked to Matthew for support . Matthew , a man of business himself , was not unsympatheticto the Clerk 's argument . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away rather than result in his capture . During the next few days Smithfield and its annual fair would be the most densely populated square mile in England . Finding a single boy who by girth and height was in no way remarkable and who might disguise his appearance with very little trouble would be like finding a certain ant in an anthill . And if Stubbs did escape , crazed as he obviously was , who knew what mischief he might do elsewhere ? " A carefully organized search of a few men , " said Matthew , " may yield better results than a rampage of every drunken roisterer in the fair  --  who will have many a young man remotelyresembling Stubbs hanged to every tree limb for the simplejoy of watching them dangle . Besides , Stubbs may not know we know of his mischief , and he may yet return if not frightenedaway by our assembly . " " Will you lend us a hand in the search , Mr. Stock ? " asked the Justice . " You know this Stubbs by sight . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew resolutely . He suggested that the bearward 's investors  --  Pullyver and Chapman  --  alsobe recruited for the search . " They 're true men and know both Stubbs and Smithfield well , " Matthew said , glancing at Babcock for support . The bearward agreed , and Francis Crisp was sent to fetch the two men . Joan offered her help also , ignoring the fact that her aid had not been solicited . " Perhaps Stubbs is with Rose Dibble , " she conjectured aloud . " If we find the girl , then . . . " " And the sooner the better for her , it would seem , " said the Justice darkly . " I 'll find them both , wherever they have concealed themselves , " Ursula growled . The pig-woman had been silent during the forgoing conversation ; her round , red face was streakedp140with a few pendulous tears . Now the thought of the fugitives had reawakened her wrath and desire for vengeance . Breathing heavily , she presented a frightening picture of imminent female violence , her nostrils flaring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing of the kind , " snapped the Justice . " Go about your business . Say nothing of what has happened here . Not to a soul . If this Rose of yours comes back to the booth or is there when you return , do nothing to her . Say nothing about Talbot or Stubbs or murder or such matters . Do not commit any violence upon her body , but bring me word at once to my house near Pie-Corner . " Somewhat grudgingly , Ursula indicated she would obey these instructions , but her nostrils continued to flare and her heavy breasts rose and fell like blacksmith 's bellows . With swollen red eyes full of hatred she glared at the Justice and the Clerk , and then at the Stocks too . " And should you see Stubbs , you are to do nothing either , " the Justice warned as Ursula went off . " Now , " said the Justice to the others with a sigh of resolve , " we must indeed organize ourselves . As for you , Mr. Babcock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly , " you are not to be blamed here , nor your bear Samson , who now appears an innocent accomplice of a maniacal Puritan . Yet I would look to your own safety . Stubbs 's possessions  --  including this cursed pamphletwhich seems to have inspired his madness  --  remain here . He may return for them . In the meantime , his weapon is not to be found and it is more than reasonable to assume he has it with him and intends to use it again . I would watch myself very carefully if I were you . When is the next baiting ? " " Tomorrow , sir , in the morning , " Babcock said . " Well , then , pray we have our murderer in hand by then . The baiting is certain to draw another huge crowd to the pit and that can only frustrate our efforts , if Stubbs is still at large . Certain it is he will be wary of capture . " While these things were being said , Joan stood thinking of Esmera . The woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the instrument of death . All she had seen in her vision as quickened by the touch of Joan 's hand . And all had come to pass . Except for her own and Matthew 's share of the risk . That had not happened . Not yet at least ; she prayed God it would n't . Yet despite her anxiety of the day and the awful revelation of the murders , Joan felt some degree of satisfaction . Her own trust in the fortune-teller had been vindicated . Matthew had been proven wrong , and like any strong-minded wife of an equally strong-minded husband , she longed to exult in her victory . But the alley was not the place , and the company was wrong too . To the Justice and the Clerk , content it seemed to exclude her from these dangerous proceedings , she would surely have appeared as unsound of mind as the crazed boy they now sought were she to begin discoursing on the amazing parallels between these dire murders and the cunning-woman 's prophecy . Justice Baynard assigned Matthew to patrol the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every booth , scan every visage , Mr. Stock . There 's a few hours of daylight left at least . Take advantage of it before darkness . Master Clerk and I will wait here for your return . " Matthew advised Joan to return to the inn . It was late . Surely she wanted a good supper after the day 's excitement . But Joan was not hungry . How could she think of eating after a long day of animal and human carnage , startling revelations , and the threat of further murders in the offing ? She said she would keep him company on his patrol . She too knew the fugitive by sight  --  and Rose Dibble too . Four eyes were better than two , she reasoned . But Matthew insisted that it was too dangerous . He insisted she return to the Hand and Shears . And so she would , if he had anything to say about it.  |p142Gabriel  Stubbs is on his way back to the bear garden , pushingthe empty wheelbarrow before him and whistling a hymn . He has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he glimpses the assembly of men clustered outside Samson 's tent . He stops dead in his tracks . His pulse races . He makes himself flat against the ratty canvas side of a confectioner'sbooth , watching like a fox whose keen eyes see every movement  --  every twitch , flutter , and blink  --  of its victim in a distant field , while from the lane-side of the booth , quite out of sight , comes the frank , ribald laughter of sinners gluttonizing on marchpane and other dainties , such sweet stuff to rot the gums and destroy the soul . Among the men he recognizes his employers and the Stocks , husband and wife . The Clerk of the Fair is there too , a very proud man . Gabriel Stubbs also sees Grotwell , the sergeant of the watch , emerging from the tent with that obstreperous shedevilUrsula at his tail like a fury , railing and cursing . Yes , the wine seller has been found , Gabriel Stubbs thinks , worse luck . The sergeant lifts the tarpaulin and shows what 's beneath to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stabbed and slashed and bloody . The men converse . Gabriel Stubbs can hear nothing for the noise of the lane , but because of her gesturesand expressions he can discern that Ursula demands to know who has murdered her friend . But if she is being told , Gabriel can not tell ; the words are lost in the air . At the safe distance he must maintain from these proceedings , all is a dumbshow of gesture and grimace . But his deed has been discovered , that 's plain . And he fearsp143they have found out his part too . Then he thinks that perhaps they have not . Did not the death of Simon Plover ( foolish knave ! ) remain a mystery to them , thanks to the good offices of a hungry bear ignorant of the distinction between human flesh and butcher 's offal ? Might not this new death , so sudden and inexplicable to them , be laid at the door of some nameless malefactor ? Are there not a devil 's plenty of such sort at the fair , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new or imagined grievance ? Gabriel is in a quandary and much in need of a burst of revelation on the matter . Should he go forward , reveal himself , or remain concealed ? Quickly and fervently , he offers a prayer that floats upward in the heavy air but to no avail , for no answerdescends to illuminate his darkness . At length he concludesthe decision must be his own . He decides to remain away from the bear garden until he can determine which way the winds of suspicion blow . For the killing of Jack Talbot , Gabriel Stubbs feels neither remorse nor strong satisfaction . He feels very little if the truth be told . If he has thought about the incident at all , he has thought about it as a sacrifice  --  holy violence he has been biddenby his voices to perform and from which , therefore , he feels detached , as though it all were some other man 's act . But the necessity of disposing of the body has been in his mind since the death , for the disposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Now Gabriel can see it is too late . The body is found . But has Gabriel covered his traces ? This concern provokes a recollection of the circumstance of the death , which in the interim has been suppressed in some obscure corner of his memory . It now comes forth and he remembersthe living , breathing , damned soul who had provoked the act in the first place . It happened this way : Not long before the commencement of the baiting , Jack Talbotappeared at Samson 's tent , not to see the bear as it might have been supposed , but Gabriel himself . Both of Gabriel 's em/ployers had been at the time occupied elsewhere : Crisp at the gate , Babcock inside the compound directing spectators to their seats . The wine seller had come in while Gabriel was preparing to open the cage to let Samson out of it , come in griping about how Gabriel and Rose had made use of his booth and bed for their lust , as he termed it . Before Gabriel had had a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's nose and calling him a filthy whoremaster and knave . " Did I not spy you twain come sneaking from the booth yesternight ? Do you supposeme a fool to be homed and gulled of my right ? " " She 's not your wife , " Gabriel had said . " Nor is she yours so to use her , " snarled Talbot . " I never used her . " " Liar ! Lousy lecher ! Smooth-faced bearer of bear 's turds ! " Pure jealous rage , that 's what it had been . Gabriel was wise enough to see that . It was the wine seller who was the lecher , the liar , the infidel and corrupter of innocent womanhood , not he . Talbot finished his tirade with a mighty oath in which the entire trinity  --  Father , Son , and Holy Ghost  --  were incorporatedand blasphemed . Gabriel could endure it no longer . When Samson , excited by the dispute , snarled suddenly , Talbot turned around to face the cage . In the same instant , Gabriel drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving him hard against the iron bars . He held Talbot there while he stabbed again and again until the wine seller 's jerkin was bloodsoaked . Then he allowed the body to slide down the bars into a heap at his feet . Gabriel knelt down beside the body , his heart thumping with such rapidity and loudness that he thought surely it could be heard above the ever-increasing din of the spectators outside the tent . His anger had driven him into a frenzy but he retained sufficient presence of mind to be aware of his danger . Any momentCrisp or Babcock or the both of them could come walking into the tent to inquire why Samson had not been brought forth . And what should they think , finding him thus , bent overp145a dead man  --  and a bloody knife in his hand to proclaim him murderer ? He turned the wine seller face up and saw by the man 's flickering eyelids and shallow breathing that by some strange fortune he still lived . Gabriel finished his work quickly . Then he dragged the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered it with the ragged tarpaulin he found there . He returned to Samson 's cage , scooped up an armful of bloody straw , and carried it outside to the wheelbarrow . He returned again to spread fresh straw before the cage , then went out again to the wheelbarrow and pushed it up the alley and around the corner to the butcher 's booth , where human blood and animal would be indistinguishable and unnoticed . He remained away from the bear garden during the baiting , returning as soon as it was done . It was then that he had seen the body had been discovered . Discovered before he had had a chance to get rid of it . Now there is one last thing that Gabriel recalls in the sequenceof events that is fast slipping into oblivion . He remembersthat as he stared down at the dying man there appeared a little film of blood upon his lips . Like wine , wine so thin and watery that it is pink . The man 's eyes are dark and glassy like stagnant pools overhung with thick willows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only  --  Talbot 's face is transformed into something strange and terrible . The pasty flesh becomes as black as an Ethiopian 's . The dark eyes grow red and glaring . It is a devil 's visage , the face of the Adversary , the demon of the worst of Gabriel Stubbs 's nightmares . Gabriel watches them from his place of concealment , the little cluster of men . He watches as they go back into the tent . Now he must find Rose , he thinks . Find Rose before Ursula does , before the sergeant and his men do . He takes a shortcut to the pig-woman 's booth and sees in the midst of the confusion there Rose struggling to serve fifty clamorouscustomers with only one other tapster to help . It takes ap146while for him to catch her attention , so great is the multitude all shouting and elbowing each other for service as though what is offered for sale here is the last pig and beer to be had in the world . He tells Rose she must come with him , straightway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confusedtoo . She looks around her as though to ask : How can I leave now with Ursula gone somewhere and only Harry Borden to help with this rout ? " The Lord wills it , " says Gabriel , fixing his eyes on her , breathing the words in such a way to suggest they are not his , but some higher power 's . She pales at this dreadful summons but still looks doubtful . A hundred voices now seem to bark in her ears , demanding her immediate attention , but she ignores them all , her attention fully upon Gabriel . He takes her hand and leads her away , her apron still about her waist and behind her expressions of anger and amazement . " What ? Shall we not be served ? Is this a time to dally ? " How can she be so bold as to desert her plain duty to provide for the hungry and thirsty of the fair ? Gabriel leads her on , searching for a place where he can talk to her privately . He needs a hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blame for the wine seller 's death has been laid at his door . If he runs too soon , he will only make himself look guilty . If he returns too soon , he may be seized . He needs an ally , and Rose is she . As they move through the crowded lane , Gabriel thinks of where he can take Rose , a fine private place , not quiet  --  as no place in Smithfield can be at fair time  --  but out of the way of prying eyes at least . It is Talbot 's own booth . Irony of ironies . As it concealed the two of them the night before , it will do so now , he thinks . Its owner will never return , and it will be shunned by those few who know of the death as an unfit resort for the living and an unlikely hideaway for the dead man 's slayer.  |p147Rose  expresses no surprise when she sees the booth and understandsthat it is their destination . She has followed obediently , seems to be in a trance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of day . Gabriel pulls her after him into the back parts of the booth . Grasping her firmly by the shoulders  --  how thin and frail they feel beneath the cheap cloth of her shift !  --  he tells her that they must be very quiet here , for he is sought by certain officers . " Officers ? " " Jack Talbot is dead , " he says . Rose stares back wide-eyed , then around the dim interior with its stock of cask and butt . He tells her as much of the truth as he thinks fit for the both of them . " It is certain the blame will be laid upon me . I was the last person to see him quick . " He tells her then ( she being still too stunned by this dreadful news to answer ) how Talbot came to the tent . To have a look at the bear , he says , and then began to complain because he had caught sight of them in the booth the night before . He tells her of the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she understands their meaning . She can hardly believe that this is all true , that Jack is dead . Like her mother , her father , never to come again . He must explain it all again , Talbot 's coming , his slanders . About the death he is deliberately vague . She stands in the shadowy space that keeps much of the day 's light from the enclosure but little of the street noise . She listens to his story intently . " I fear I 'm the one they 'll blame , not understanding the man he was . A slanderer , vicious , a tool of the Evil One . " " Are you sure he 's dead ? " she asks . " I 'm sure . " " But we ca n't stay here . I must go back . Ursula  --  " " You can not go back . Not yet . I must tell you more . " He is tempted to tell her about the vision  --  the terriblecountenance of the dead man . He explains that he must stayp148hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can do him and God a great service . " A service . A service for God ? " she asks , wide-eyed , tremblinga little . " Nothing less than that , " he says . " Speak but the word , " she says . He bends down and kisses her on the cheeks , still warm and smoky from the roasting fires . He tastes her tears , feels her supplebody molded against his own , feels her heart fluttering like a little bird trapped in a hollow tree . And Rose can feel against her breast the hardness of steel within Gabriel 's bosom . She looks at him in sudden confused alarm , drawing away , her body as taut as the blade physical closeness has revealed . Too late he remembers the poniard , strapped in its sheath next to his heart . " Oh , this , " he says casually . " It 's for my protection . " Slowly he removes the weapon and shows it to her . He does not remove the instrument from its long cylindrical case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no skill in its employment . He lays it down in the straw at her feet , a tribute . " Here , " he says softly . " I 'll put it aside if the thing alarms you . " He stares long and hard at her white face , gauging her response . She seems nervous and uncertain . He begins to explain that God never forbade the defense of oneself and that there is no evil in a weapon but only in its unlawful use . And what is unlawful ? Why , that which the Lord of Heaven expressly forbids . False witness , adultery , covetousness , disrespect for parents , murder . That which the Lord commands is not unlawful , is not a sin . Hence if a killing were done by divine command , it would be no sin . The conclusion follows as the night the day . Does n't it ? Rose thinks about this , then admits at length that it must be true . What God commands can not be sin , since sin is disobedience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his logic.  |p149He  puts to her a case of conscience , using the simplest of terms and propositions , as one might explain a difficult circumstanceto a child . Suppose , Gabriel says , a man were ordered to kill  --  by God . The victim being no innocent soul but a damned villain or cruel tyrant or sorcerer or any other of Satan 's progency , wicked to the core . Would it not be a righteous act to obey God and kill the evildoer in such a case ? He must describe these particulars twice before Rose understands , but once she understands , the principle is fast in her mind . She agrees that to kill under such circumstances and with such sanction would be no fault . Indeed , to disobey in such a case would be the sin . " Even if the damned villain were a seeming friend  --  as was this wine seller ? " he asks , continuing his catechism . " Nay , no sin surely . " " Or a person of note , a gentleman or a lord ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great one . " " Or for that matter , a king or a queen ? " She nods . The lesson continues . Rose listens enraptured , her dark , wide-set eyes large and bright . Only half she understands of what he tells her now , these mysteries of godliness , the privilegedinformation of the Elect . But more than half is enough . She is in love with this young man and is no longer able to distinguish him from the God of whom he speaks with such eloquence and familiarity . The lesson ends . Now she understands that Jack Talbot 's death was God 's will . That Gabriel was the instrument of that will she also understands , though Gabriel has only implied it . All this she accepts ; she feels no anxiety ; she is at peace . And Gabriel too is at peace because he has found an ally in Smithfield , in this Babylon of wickedness , and perhaps too , a disciple . But suppertime is drawing on and Rose 's mind turns inevitablyto the world outside their hiding place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And found Rose gone . Surely thep150pig-woman 's rage is now at the full and stirred into a hurricane by the unaccountable absence of her servant . Rose can already feel the blows , not to mention the words that slash like razors , a thousand abusive epithets from one with a genius for calumnies . " The beastly creature will be mourning for her friend and seeing to his burial  --  too full of grief to worry about you , " Gabriel says to pacify her anxiety . But she continues to fret and Gabriel , eager now to know where he stands with the bearwards and the officers , shapes his plan . He will send Rose to the bear garden to pick up any odd scrap of news about the wine seller 's death . She will return to report , avoiding Ursula at all cost . If he is suspected , he will flee , taking Rose with him . If unsuspected , he will invent some plausible excuse to account for his absence , resume his menial duties , and await , as before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent whispers , repeating each instruction so that she understands perfectly what she is to do and why . Then he prays over her , long and solemnly , invokingGod 's blessings on the speediness of her legs , the alertness of her ears , the sharpness of her sight  --  all essential in this daringenterprise . He kisses her chastely on the cheek after the amen is pronounced , the cheek still warm , still smoky from the cooking fires , and admonishes her one last time to remember whom she serves and in how great a cause , while darkness comes cranking down on Smithfield like an iron portcullis , massive and final.  |p151The  faces Matthew and Joan sought among so many faces had eluded them during their tedious patrol . Now the gathering darkness made matters worse . A riot of color in the sun , BartholomewFair took on a more fantastic and sinister aspect underthe mantle of night . Torches and lanterns provided the sole illumination for the shadowy streets , yet the narrow passages were as jammed as ever and the rowdiness of the crowd increasedas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became more threatening , shouting insults and challengesat strangers , all for the pleasure of a casual brawl . Whores became more insolent , the drunks drunker , pickpockets more daring . But despite these things , Matthew and Joan continued their search . Up and down the streets they went until their cobbles and signs , doorways and windows were as familiar to them as those of Chelmsford 's own High Street . It seemed to Joan that the pair of fugitives must surely have disappeared from the face of the earth . " This is useless , Matthew , " Joan said at length , footweary and with a growing sense of the futility of it all . " Surely Stubbs has fled the city  --  and taken Rose Dibble with him . " " Or he 's killed her , like the others , " answered Matthew gloomily . But this unpleasant thought had crossed Joan 's mind even as she spoke of their flight . She feared it was true , but her mind recoiled at the image of another brutalized body , especially the girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had a feeling of protectiveness for her that sprang from Joan 's own motherhood and nurturing instincts . Even if Rose werep152still alive  --  and God keep the girl if she was  --  she was in great danger . Stubbs was clearly mad , and madness knew no restraints . Anyone coming in contact with the seemingly pleasant young man might be deceived by his charm , then victimized after . Joan shuddered at the thought . They had stopped awhile in their search ; now Matthew suggestedthey move on . He was not ready to give up yet . He said he thought Stubbs might still be at the fair since it was unlikely the young Puritan would leave behind him his few personal possessions , especially the visionary pamphlet with its incriminatingannotations and drawings . This brought to Joan 's mind Esmera 's prophecy , and she took the opportunity to tell Matthew all that had transpired that morning and how the wise woman 's words had been verified by the wine seller 's death . Matthew listened attentively as they walked , but when she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was forced to ask him outright what he thought now , now that proof was before him like a fallen tree on the road of his cynicism . " She was lucky , " he said simply , not taking his eyes off of the booths , the strange faces , the night sky barren of stars and , as yet , moon . " Lucky ! A most marvelous luck indeed to have guessed with such accuracy . Why , see , husband , she described the dead man . " " Only in general terms , " he reminded her . " She never saw his face . " " But the knife ! The knife ! She described it . And she warned us against prolonging our stay here , which means the death she perceived in her vision was somehow connected to us , and so Jack Talbot 's death was , for Stubbs had also murdered the puppetmaster near our very town . " " I admit that touching upon that matter , the woman spoke truly , " he said . " Fiddlesticks ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband moved on ; Joan hurried to keep up . How obsti/nate he was ! How impervious to reason ! How he rankled her with his masculine hardheadedness ! Why was he being so difficultwhen the evidence was so plain ? Esmera was no fraud , but a genuine seer , endowed with marvelous capacity . " She warned us of danger to ourselves , Matthew ! " " And that 's another thing , " he said , stopping and turning to face her at last . " She was most insistent on that point , the danger to us rather than to the others . " " She was indeed , " Joan admitted , failing to catch his drift . " Suspiciously so . " Then she wanted to know what he meant by so prolonging that word suspiciously , as though the word had twice its syllables and each must be savored in discourse . Or did he simply mean to tantalize her by suggesting he knew something that she did not ? With her husband in this cranky humor that too was possible . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fact . Now tell me , then , if this woman came to you with such a warning for your safety and mine , why did she not tell the wine seller about his danger , for since he 's dead he was obviously more in need of her wisdom than we ? The poor fellow died with nary a word from her , a word that might have saved his life . " But Joan was ready for this argument too . " As far as we know she might have warned him and he failed to heed her and so he died when he might have saved himself . " She said this pointedlyand waited for her husband 's response . " The greengrocer Pullyver was at her tent , was n't he ? You said you saw him in his new doublet , coming out of the tent where he had had conference with the woman . Esmera should have warned him , since he was as near to the dead man as you or I. But only you were warned . Why , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culled out like a ripe plum from a limb full of many fruit . I swear it , Joan , this Esmera of yours is up to something . Mark my words . " Now it was Joan 's turn to walk ahead . She was weary of quarrelingwith her husband . She pretended to be wholly preoc/cupied with the passing scene , the faces that  --  shadowy and distorted in the weak , uncertain torchlight  --  were like mummers ' masks . Matthew followed , but neither talked of Esmera again . The unresolved dispute hung heavy on them both . Then she heard herself and Matthew hailed from somewhere ahead and presently she could distinguish the rest of the search party , who , earlier having been sent abroad in pairs , had now reassembled and bore the look of weariness and defeat on their faces . Grotwell motioned the Stocks to join the group , which then turned into a quiet alley . " Well , what luck , Mr. Stock ? " asked Grotwell , somewhat perfunctorily , for it was obvious that the Stocks had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew . " I once saw a fellow that might have been he , " Chapman offered . The tall , gangling scrivener was clearly excited by his noctural adventure and seemed anxious to have the approval of the others . " A thousand or more could have been he , but were n't , " remarkedFrancis Crisp dryly . " Nay , ten thousand , " Pullyver added . After this response , Chapman looked abashed and said nothing . Then there was some talk about what was to be done next and whether the pursuit of the bearward 's helper was worth the while since all of Smithfield had been searched thrice over and the hour of curfew was at hand . It was agreed by all present that the little band of hardy searchers had done its best , under the circumstances , and Grotwell suggested they should all make for home since his own watch was done and his relief soon to appear . They were in the midst of leave-taking when they heard Ursula 's voice . She was coming down the lane toward them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and bleeding lip gave evidence that the pig-woman had already commenced to exact her promised vengeance , contrary to the Justice 's command.  | " Here , my masters , is the slender baggage you seek , she that is so great with the murderer of Jack Talbot , " Ursula declared . " Here is the lice-ridden blackbird , this deal of lies and infamies , this pinch-boned , addlepated whorelet . " Grotwell interrupted Ursula 's litany of abuse to demand when and where the girl had been discovered and whether Stubbs had been with her . He did not seem to care that Rose had been beaten or that Ursula had defied the Justice 's orders . " I found her in the street , like a common drab , " Ursula said . " No , Stubbs were n't with her . If he was , I would have dragged the miserable wretch by his privy member , yes , and wrapped it around his neck and hanged him with it . Where 's the scum ? ' I shouted at her ear . Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't talk , though I threatened , yes , and beat upon her too , as you can plainly see . With my pig pan I threatened her . You 'll talk now , young strumpet , ' says I , and dragged her around until I found you here everyone . " " Wo n't talk , will she ? " said Grotwell . " I 'll make her talk . " " All she 'll say is that he 's innocent , this Stubbs fellow . Fancy that , sirs . Innocent ! " Ursula spat the word as though it fouled her mouth . " All she babbles is nonsense . " " What sort of nonsense ? " Matthew asked , looking at the silent , quaking girl . " Why , such nonsense as the boy was not to blame for what was done , that it was God 's will that the wine seller die , and that he , meaning this wretch Stubbs , was no more guilty of the death than she , but is as innocent as a lamb . Innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed with a dry , throaty laugh and a rapture of sarcasm . " Which is to say no less than the both of them are as guilty as hell . Oh , I tell you , sirs , she knows where the young puke lurks . " " This young man of yours has killed Jack Talbot , " Grotwell said accusingly . " Stabbed him dead as a doornail . And before that he murdered Simon Plover , late of the parish and former helper to Mr. Babcock here , and before that another poor fellownamed Fitzhenry. "  | " Fitzhugh , " corrected Matthew . " Fitzhugh , then , " said Grotwell . " He 's dead , whatever his name may be . All in cold blood , the three of them . Now , what do you say about that , mistress fishface ? Will you tell us where Stubbs is ? By God , if you do n't  --  " Here Joan intervened , to Grotwell 's great displeasure , to protesthis abuse of a girl whose complicity in the murders as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you speak less threateningly to her , " Joan suggested calmly but firmly , " we may find out something and get home to bed this night after all . " " Very well , Mrs. Stock , " Grotwell conceded . " Maybe I should allow you to question her . " " May I ask her a question or two ? " asked Matthew , inserting himself between the sergeant and Joan . Grotwell said that he might , but complained that it was shameful how the law must be hamstrung by the meddling of those who were not even citizensof the town , no matter what friends these same persons might have in high places . Matthew ignored the sergeant 's scurrilous tone and asked Rose how she was so sure Gabriel Stubbs was innocent . He said he agreed with the sergeant that the evidence was plain , and Grotwell showed the frightened girl the very warrant for Stubbs 's arrest that Justice Baynard had signed within the hour . But the sight of the document had no effect on Rose , who could not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , but with great difficulty , for she was obviously terrifiedby the men around her . " He told me he was innocent , " she said . Whereupon the men laughed outright and Ursula fell into another tirade of abuse . But Joan did not laugh and neither did Matthew . Joan 's heart ached for pity  --  pity for the swollen , bloody lip and bruised eye that marred the otherwise lovely face . " He told you ? " asked Grotwell with a sneer . " Well , now , gentles , does n't that prove she knows where Stubbs is hiding ? Damn the villain 's innocence or guilt . We want to know wherep157he is and you , girl , will tell us or the consequences will be dreadful . Your employer 's beating will be only the beginning of your miseries . I charge you now , Rose Dibble , in the Queen 's name , to reveal his place of concealment or be as guilty of these murders as Stubbs himself . " This dreadful threat with its reference to the Queen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater paroxysms of terror . She began to babble incoherently about angels and devils , God and commandments , obedience and disobedience , and like language . Grotwell said the girl had been listening to too many sermons and that the practice had made her as mad as Stubbs . Witnessing such confusion in the girl 's speech , Joan feared the sergeant might be right . Had a religious lunacy infected Rose too ? But to the others present , and especially to Ursula , all Rose 's talk of God and angels was only a ruse to affect innocencewhere there was none . " Satan himself can speak godly if he chooses , " observed Pullyver , as though he were as familiar with the subject as with his leeks and turnips , cabbages and pears . The scrivener agreed , but the two bearwards said that the beating had knocked her brains awry and hence her confusion and they were in favor of letting her go , for they thought there was no real evidence against her , and that surely her present insanity mitigated her crimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " declared Pullyver with stolid conviction . " Indeed it is not , " Grotwell agreed . " A cabbage head may hang as well as a scholar . There 's precedent for it . " Matthew took the bearwards ' view and began to speak on the girl 's behalf , while Ursula screamed , " She 's lying , lying in her teeth . " Then Joan prevailed upon Grotwell to allow her to ask a few questions . She said she thought the interrogation was much too violent and wanted a woman 's subtler touch . Ursula let out ap158great derisive guffaw but then shut up with the others to hear what questions Joan would put to Rose and with what success . Joan approached Rose and pulled her away from the officers , who had been holding her tightly as though any moment the slim girl would spring from their clutches and dash off into the darkness . Joan smiled reassuringly at the quaking girl . " I 've a daughter of about your years , " Joan said . " You and she are of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Now tell me , if Gabriel is as innocent as you declare and he evidently claims , surely he would wish to say as much to the sergeant here , who wants nothing more than to find out the truth . Is n't that right , sergeant ? " Joan cast a glance at Grotwell , who was smirking at her with such insolence that she would have gladly borrowed Ursula 's pig pan and remodeled his head with it . Grotwell said in a wheedlingvoice , " Oh yes , Mrs. Stock . The truth and nothing more . " Joan turned to the girl again . " Would n't Gabriel want us to know he was innocent ? " she continued . " If Gabriel tells us he is innocent of the wine seller 's death , then we will know for a surety . Even as you do now . You do want us to know , do n't you ? " Rose nodded her head but still did not speak . She had stopped trembling and looked trustingly at Joan . " Please tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haltingly and in a barely audible voice . " All should know , even as I. He will explain . Explain as he did to me . Come , I 'll show you where he is . He 'll tell you everythingthat happened and why . You 'll see . As innocent as a lamb . It 's all God 's work , every whit . He 's at Jack 's booth . I left him hiding there . He wanted me to find out how things stood at the bear garden , whether he was accused and sought or not suspected at all . I never discovered until Ursula found me , for when I went to the pit there was no one there save the bear . " " I think she 's lying , " Grotwell said when Rose had finished her statement . " Why should he be hiding in the dead man 's booth ? Why , it 's a ridiculous place to conceal himself . "  | " Not so ridiculous , " Joan said . " No one thought to look there , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would think to look , " Matthew added . Pullyver and Chapman and the two bearwards all said theythought the girl was telling the truth , on this matter at least , and all were eager to look for Stubbs in the wine seller 's booth . " Well , it wo n't hurt to look , " Grotwell conceded . Joan went forward to put her arms around Rose , defying the officers to interfere . She felt a sinking in her own heart now that Rose had confessed Stubbs 's hiding place . It seemed somehowsinful to take advantage of one so vulnerable to honeyed words . But honey had done it in a way that all Ursula 's violenceof body and word had not . Rose had surrendered her secret , and as far as Joan could tell by her expression , Rose imagined she had done Stubbs a favor in doing so . " Well , bring her along , " Grotwell said to his men . " If she is telling the truth , the young devil is ours . In the wine seller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but the lad 's got his nerve if he is there . You 've got to give him credit for that , madman or no . " The curfew hour had come and the booths of Bartholomew Fair were closing one by one , until it was quite dark and the fair looked like a deserted city whose inhabitants had long ago fled some pestilence . The raucous music of the day had dwindled into a few isolated good-nights and the whine of scavaging dogs and cats in the alleys . Through these now , Grotwell led the way , torch aloft , stopping at a sufficient distance from the wine seller 's booth so as not to betray the presence of himself or his band . Skeptical before , Grotwell now talked sanguinely about capturing Stubbs and began to sketch out a plan of attack . He committed Rose into the Stocks ' care . The rest were to go on ahead , Babcock and Crisp to circle the booth and take it from behind , Pullyver and Chapman to proceed quietly to the end of the lane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two officers was to go the honor of invadingp160the booth directly , with the specific instruction of the sergeant that Stubbs was to be taken , dead or alive , and if dead all the better . " Stubbs is a killer , remember that , " Grotwell said , handingthe torch to Matthew . " Here , Mr. Stock , you take the torch . We do n't need light to advertise our presence . " With the prospect of violence in the offing , Joan was happy to remain in her husband 's company , away from the immediate danger . Yet she was still afraid . The street was so dark and quiet now ; the booths so forbidding . Matthew also seemed nervous , as did the other men  --  all save the sergeant , who was used to such bloody encounters , she supposed . The poor scrivener looked as though any minute he would be sick in the street , so pale he seemed by torchlight . Grotwell then motioned the men into place and Joan watched , her heart in her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men went off . Rose also watched , praying aloud for the fugitive . Joan saw the shadows that were the sergeantand his two men steal inside the distant booth and then heard a hoarse cry of alarm . It was Grotwell 's voice , she thought . Then there was more shouting and curses too and garbled replies from somewhere behind the booth . She heard the sound of splintering wood , as though the invaders were tearing down the booth to get to Stubbs . All during this commotion Matthew and Joan held their breaths , but almost as quickly as the action commenced it was over , or so it seemed . They were soon coming back , all of the men . They were quarreling and cursing and Grotwell 's complaintswere the loudest and most bitter . The attack had failed . Stubbs had not been found in the booth . He had either escaped in what now seemed  --  to Joan at least  --  a ridiculously inept attempt to trap him , or long before , warned by Rose or by his own instincts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe the Devil too . " Damnation ! " cried Grotwell bitterly . " I 'm cursed if that filthy rogue did n't slip by us all . " " Or was never there , " said Francis Crisp . " I saw no man . "  | " It was no fault of mine , " protested Pullyver , who was out of breath but for no apparent reason since both he and Chapman had remained at a safe distance during the assault . Grotwell 's officers blamed each other . The one said the other was clumsy of foot and gave warning to the fugitive , who hearing the noise stole from the back of the tent through a hole in the canvas . The officer accused of this retorted that it was his companion , rather , who signaled the alarm by crying out like an idiot . " Which cry would have raised the dead man , much more his murderer . " They two argued about this while Francis Crisp and Ned Babcock insisted that they had seen no one in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grotwell . " Not in this gloom . Besides , he knows we 're after him . He 's been warned good , he has , slippery devil . " He turned to Rose . " Now , mistress , " he said sternly , taking the torch again from Matthew and thrusting it forward so that it came close to singeing the girl 's hair , " we may have lost your confederate , but we have you and we shall carry you forthwith to Justice Baynard , who will deal with you as you deserve . " Joan protested the arrest of Rose , who had done nothing wrong that she could see , but Matthew pointed out that Rose was now in greater risk than before , for surely Stubbs would reason that she had been the one who had led them all to his hiding place and thus betrayed him . But Rose denied that Gabriel Stubbs would harm her . " He 's an angel , an angel of God , " she repeated , while the sergeant 's men laughed outright. " 0 poor fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , " he said to his men . Then Grotwell wished Matthew and Joan good-night and the same to the bearwards and Chapman and Pullyver . He thanked them all for their efforts , unsuccessful as they had been . After he and his men had gone , Pullyver said to Babcock , " It seems you are ever beset with bad luck , friend Ned . Surely this new incident of death augurs an uncertain futureat the least . Once it is bruited about that you harbored a maniacal Puritan in your midst , your reputation will stink , stinkp162worse that Smithfield . You best sell while you can , Ned , while you can . Why , look you now , I 'll buy you out  --  we 'll settle the score . " " I 'll not sell , " Babcock said resolutely . " Well said , " remarked Francis , who seemed more alarmed by this talk of selling the bear garden than he had been in confrontinga dangerous fugitive . " Samson 's been exonerated , " Babcock said . " You heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for the boy 's fanaticalreligiosity . Besides , we 'll all turn a tidy profit yet  --  even more perhaps . " Chapman said he thought it was well past the hour to be discussing business , but Pullyver argued it was the best of times , especially in light of recent events and the great likelihood of there being more trouble ahead . An argument ensued between the greengrocer and the two bearwards , during which voices were raised and slanders were exchanged to the point that Joan was disgusted with the lot of them and wanted nothing more than to return to the inn and a comfortable bed . But Matthew was somehow dragged into the discussion and he lingered . Finally , Joan interrupted to borrow the torch and left the men arguing in the dark while she walked over to the booth to see the damage wrought by Grotwell 's invasion . She climbed over the debris and entered the wine seller 's private quarters . Inside she saw a wooden chest overturned and all its contents strewn about , several large malmsey butts still upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken . There was a strong odor of sweet malmsey and she supposedin the fracas some had been spilled and had since seeped down into the straw to give joy to the lice , mites , and other small creatures crawling therein . The canvas back of the booth had been rent , and she wondered if this had been done by the sergeant and his men or by the fleeing Stubbs . There was no other evidence around to suggest that during the earlier part of the evening the booth had been the hiding place of a murderer or that Grotwell 's raucous intrusion had done any other good but to dispel the lingering ghost of Jack Talbot.  |p163Matthew  and Joan returned to the inn , both too weary from the night 's adventure to speak further of the murder or lament the loss of supper . Clutching Matthew 's arm for security , Joan was aware of their vulnerability in the black night , in the strange city . In her brain a discordant company of conflicting interpretations , suppositions , and theories struggled with one another for preeminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inn , they found the door fast and the house apparently asleep . Matthew was forced to stand before the door crying out for the host and pounding until at length the host came , wiping sleep from his eyes and looking quite absurd in a nightshirt that came to mid-shank of his bare , hairy legs and slipperless feet . Recognizing Matthew as the clothier of Chelmsford , he said , " You 're wanted , Mr. Stock . Master Clerk of the Fair , Justice Baynard , and other gentlemen of note await your return this half hour or more . They sent me to bed , sir , but the rest are in the Lion . " Mathew thanked the host for the message and exchanged glances with Joan to indicate he was as perplexed by this summonsas she , although she supposed it certainly must have something to do with the Bartholomew Fair murders . " The gentlemen said you must come straightway , " the host said , eyeing Matthew with a mixture of curiosity and envy that he should be connected in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joan with candles and wished them good-night . While Matthew went to the Lion to fulfill his appointment , Joan went sleepily upstairs to their chamber . Holding one candlealoft , she inspected the unfamiliar interior , feeling thep164heavy weight of depression she always experienced when faced with the prospect of a night 's sleep in a house not her own , in a bed not her own . No cheery fire had been laid in the grate to welcome her with its bright licks of flame and smoky smell and cracks and snaps . None had been needed in this dry , hot month . The casement had been left open to air the room . She closed the casement , lighted the larger candle at the bedside , extinguished the smaller , then went to make fast the door . Now more than ever it seemed prudent . She would let Matthew in when he was finished with his meeting and only after he had identified himself as he and not some other . She made ready for bed , thinking about Stubbs , remembering him as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , odoriferous wheelbarrow . A handsome , well-shaped young man , his limp notwithstanding  --  of poor condition but goodly manners , soft , pleasing voice , clear eye , ready smile . Who would have thought him to be what he was , a monster of sorts , vicious and deadly , wearing his godliness as a concealment . She had not suspected him of being a Puritan at all , much less one driven by dreams and visions . Yet the evidence he was guilty was incontrovertible . What a strange world it was , and what even stranger persons dwelt in it . And how dreadful madness was too . She had known a madmanonce , years before when she was a child . A scatterbrain with rheumy eyes and lantern jaw . Yet harmless . The man thought himself a bird . He would flap his arms and cry out shrilly like a lapwing to the delight of the neighborhood children , of whom Joan had been one , amazed and amused as the others by his curious deviation from rational behavior . As though the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had run around the fields , this loony , skipping and gamboling , leaping suddenly upward on legs of amazing springiness , raising his arms in the attitude of flight , splaying his fingers , crying shrilly . His name had been Stephen , she rememberedas she had not in years . Stephen Cribbage , the madman of Chelmsford . His aging mother kept him at home , where hep165cut wood , gathered acorns to make bread , and harvested wild radishes in their season . In midsummer he found berries and tried to fly . But if Stephen Cribbage had dreams and visions , he did not report them . Content to be a bird when the humor struck him , he had done no murders . And therefore Stubbs 's madness , equally as unfathomable to her understanding , was of a different sort , not the simple derangementpeople spent good money to see among the mindsickat Bethlem Hospital . Stubbs 's madness was the stuff of nightmares . Joan said her prayers and climbed into the bed , but she did not extinguish the candle at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no relish for the greater darkness without it . Besides , she wanted to remain awake  --  both to let Matthew in when he and the gentlemen were done and to discover what business had kept him from her . She wondered who these other gentlemen of note were the host had spoken of . But in time , rubbing these same thoughts raw , she succumbed to a fitful sleep , and in her sleep she dreamed of Esmera , who clutched Joan 's wrists with her strong hands , pressed her long , strangely beautiful face into Joan 's , and whispered of catastrophes to come . The Lion was not a bedchamber but a well-furnished parlor used for private suppers and other meetings of the inn 's more wealthy clientele . The room took its name from a large faded tapestry that hung on one wall and depicted the king of beasts surrounded by a flock of lambs and other innocuous creatures who showed no fear of it . The scene symbolized the period of Christ 's reign spoken of in the Scriptures , when lamb and lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This image of holy promise had thus been the witness of many considerably less holy festivities , some of them downright sordid , but of these Matthew knew only by hearsay . When Matthew had come to the door , even before knockingp166he could hear from within the sound of a familiar voice and he waited a moment until he placed it in his memory . Grotwell let him in , but it was not Grotwell 's voice Matthew had heard . " Come in , Mr. Stock of Chelmsford . You 're right welcome among us , " said Sir Robert Cecil . Despite the great social gulf that separated them , the two men who now greeted each other knew each other well . Matthewhad served the Queen 's Principal Secretary before , once in the discovery of a particularly sinister and pernicious piece of espionage involving a London jeweler who cared more for Spanish gold than for his country , a discovery that would hardly have been made had it not been for Matthew  --  and for Joan too , to give her the credit due her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Secretary was seated in a large , straight-backed chair that underscored his own diminutive stature , so that he vaguely resembled a child with a middle-aged man 's sallow cheeks and baggy eyes . The thought passed quickly through Matthew 's mind that were it not for the accident of birth by which Cecil was a great man 's son and not some common laborer 's , this little man might have ended up among the freaks of Bartholomew Fair , for many , and especially his enemies , ridiculed him for being no bigger than a dwarf . Forming a semicircle around Cecil were the Clerk , the Justice , and Cecil 's secretary , John Wynn , a tall , dark man of about thirty with spectacles and notebook . An oil lamp burned smokily on the table so that the features of the tapestry could be dimly perceived . Cecil came to the matter at hand at once . " The sergeant here has just finishing apprising us of the night 's adventure  --  or misadventure , as the case seem to be , " Cecil said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant . " I thought it best to inform Sir Robert of the murders , " the Justice said . " And you were well-advised to do so , " Cecil said , keeping his eyes fixed on Matthew . " It 's a crying shame the fellow escaped you , but what 's done is done . We are now on the horns of ap167dilemma . The Queen , God bless her , is resolute in her purpose to visit the fair , despite a recent indisposition that has kept her two days in bed this very week . She has expressly forbidden any elaborate preparations for her visit . She prefers to mingle , as she calls it , with her subjects . To take them by surprise with less than the usual pageantry . Oh , she will be guarded , of course . She will be welcomed by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen , the Clerk here , and other officials of the fair . These then will conduct her about , after which she returns to my house on the Strand for supper . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large in Smithfield , and the sergeant here says that you have implicated the man in an even earlier death in Chelmsford . " Matthew said that it was all true and briefly recounted the circumstances of the puppet master 's murder . " Can not the Queen 's visit be prevented until the murderer is taken ? " Matthewasked at the conclusion of his recital . " If you mean by prevented ' cancelled , it can be and certainly will , if wisdom dictates . That cancellation would hardly be pleasing to Her Majesty , whose mind is set on her coming . She is , however , so fearful of assassination these days that the very whisper of danger will bring an end to her plans , but she will hardly be pleased that a murderer remains at large , having been identified by name , or that her anticipated pleasures have been denied her . She is not a woman to brook disappointment . It would all look very bad for the Clerk here ; worse for the Justice , who might have captured Stubbs earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she may determine that I knew of the danger sometime before giving her warning of it . You can see , then , Mr. Stock , what a bind we all are in . " Matthew could see indeed , although what his own role in the matter was eluded him . He had no official capacity in Smithfield . He had merely been helping a friend . " What is to be done , then , Sir Robert ? " asked the Justice , breaking a moment 's awkward silence and wearing a chastened expression.  |p168Cecil  , turning his head upward to the Justice , said , " Very simple , Mr. Justice . The murderer must be taken before Her Majesty 's visit . " Matthew thought he saw Justice Baynard wince ; certainly Cecil 's words made Grotwell , standing by the door , squirm . " We should have called the hue and cry at first , " the Justice said , staring pointedly at the Clerk , who had persuaded him against it . " You agreed not to , , , returned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not responsible for the maintenanceof order in Smithfield . " " Then you should not have stuck your nose into my business , " replied the Justice curtly , " but suffered me to do what I would . " Cecil held up a hand to stay this dispute , which threatened to grow hotter . " Peace , " he said , " the both of you . Squabbling about who 's to blame will do no good now . What 's done is done . Blame may fall on all our shoulders later . For the present , let 's see what good may come of our mistakes . I understand our Clerk 's desire to save the fair 's profits and avoid panic . And the Justice 's willingness to comply . Hindsight has proved foresight a fool in this case , but who can know the future ? On the other hand , the Queen must be protected , even from the very rumor of trouble . " Cecil paused and looked up again at the Justice . " Mr. Justice , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know Gabriel Stubbs by sight . Make deputies of the lot of them but , save for those who already know of his treachery , inform none of why he must be apprehended . Take the man dead or alive . If you can not apprehend him , at least you may be able to determinethat he has fled and presents therefore no danger . Afflictedas he is with religious madness , who knows what his ultimate design may be ? The very sight of Her Majesty may inflame his mind to new treachery , for she has done much of late to rankle the more rigorous sort of Puritan . " Baynard said he would do everything that Cecil ordered . Hep169turned to Grotwell and declared , " See that Sir Robert 's instructionsare carried out . " Grotwell said he would do it , though it cost him his life . " We hope matters wo n't press to that extremity , " remarked Cecil dryly . Cecil dismissed the Justice , the Clerk , and the sergeant , indicatingat the same time that Matthew should remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down in a chair opposite him and began to speak in a more familiar manner . " I can speak with greater candor now , Matthew . It is most important that the Queen follow through with her plan to visit the fair tomorrow . Her visit has been well-advertised , not only among the commons but among the foreign visitors of the City , who will be as curious to glimpse the Queen as are her subjects . She 's old and , it grieves me to say it , infirm . " You well know how rumor every day proclaims her imminentdeath and how such rumors instill in the multitude fears and anxieties of which the Queen 's enemies , here and abroad , may make good use . Now a public demonstration of her vigor would be a great advantage to the public peace and certain diplomatic negotiations now in progress . Seeing her move about in her wonted manner , drinking and eating with her subjects , would inspire confidence that she is Queen still , although aged and worn as nature has disposed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified , would give the opposite impression  --  thatshe is in decline ; that she is changeful and moody and takes no delight in her own people , keeps not her promises and is two legs and an arm in her grave . No , a cancellationwould be most inadvisable . The tale of a murderer of such grotesque sort as this would not be credited . Yet the Queen must not be exposed to danger . " Here Cecil paused , took a deep breath . His voice fell to a confidential whisper . " Matthew , my friend , it is twelve of the clock if I marked the last toll of Paul 's correctly . By this same hour of the morning the Queen will leave Whitehall forp170Smithfield . Before that hour I must say yea or nay to the enterprise . Help me in good conscience to say yea . " Matthew was about to ask just how he was to assist , but Cecil anticipated the question . He raised an open palm to suggest that Matthew do nothing but listen until he was finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I expect you to have unraveled all this . " " Unraveled , sir , but  --  " " Nay , hear me out and mark me well . You are not as this Grotwell , a man whose wit is in his brawn and strength in his club . In times past you have served me well , yes , and England too . I have more than once mentioned it to the Queen and were I in position now to reveal to her these matters , she would surely commission you as I am about to do . " " What exactly would you have me do , Sir Robert ? " " Marry , this . I have looked at this pamphlet given me of Justice Baynard . " Here Cecil paused and took the pamphlet that his personal secretary , John Wynn , had been holding the while . " It makes interesting reading , I 'll say that much for it , what little I have had time and energy to peruse at this late hour . The author , Foxworth , is learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasivenessif one 's theological interests run in that direction . But even a good book may prove dangerous in the hands of the wrong person . As thus it is in the present case . Now , as I say , I have perused the pamphlet to catch its drift . You , Matthew , must search out its eddies and currents , its treacherous backwaters . Sound its depths , paying particular attention to these copious notes in the margin , which the Justice tells me are the very work of Gabriel Stubbs . " " They are his work , sir , " Matthew said . " For we found his pen and inkhorn in his pack and Francis Crisp the bearward will swear that they are Stubbs 's . " " Very well , then , " Cecil went on . " Even a madman works by some method , if we can only find it out . And if there be a method here , study may make it known . I would do the workp171myself , were there not pressing business at court that requires my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this onerous duty , with my prayers for your success . If there is a method to this Stubbs 's madness , find it out . Before noon tomorrow , Matthew , before noon . " Cecil frowned , but not at Matthew , at a thought in his mind rather , a deep meditation . Behind him John Wynn stood at attention , his eyelids drooping for the lateness of the hour . " I have read enough of the pamphlet and Stubbs 's comment to discern in him one who reads with a literal mind . If an allegory is employed , he takes it a thing he might encounter rounding a corner . He reckons not symbols , but sees hard matter in mists and vapors , poetic flourishes and parables . Damn him if he would n't trip over a sonnet , if his interest in poetry were as great as his study of the Scriptures . But that 's all one . What is important is that you absorb , somehow , his peculiar notions . Read the book carefully . Where does his thinking lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Matthew protested . " All the better for this work , " Cecil answered . " You 'll not be distracted by what 's irrelevant to the present purpose . Mark what kind of Puritan he is , this Stubbs , for some , as you know , are so earnest in their cause that they would make water on Christ 's tomb to show their contempt for relics and would rather tweak the Pope 's nose than find a ready admission to heaven . Oh , they are a strange breed , indeed , and have given Her Majesty much grief . Worse than Catholics , she calls them ; and I confess , while I 'm no Papist , I must concur in her condemnation . " Here , for example , is this Gabriel Stubbs , a simple bearward'shelper ( and God knows what before ) , who feels called upon by the Divine Being to pluck down enormities in Smithfield . Well , he 's not the first of his sect to decry Bartholomewpig , scorn cakes and ale , and think himself a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sodom and Gomorrah of others , eh , Matthew ? " Cecil 's face darkened again , having been momentarily bright/ened perhaps by the thought of the young Puritan assaulting the pig sellers and gingerbread sellers of the fair . " Well , thanks be to God we are not sinners of that sort , but love good food , good wine , and , yes , pray to heaven too . " Cecil laughed pleasantly . He handed the pamphlet to Matthew . " Justice Baynard 's a wise fellow and the Clerk 's no fool either . They 'll give what help you may need . I have told them of the confidence I place in you and reaffirm that confidence now . Yet twelve hours , Matthew , no more . If the murderer is not taken by then , the Queen 's visit must be stayed  --  with what repercussions I have already outlined . She does have her heart set on this appearance , thinking it may well be the last Bartholomew Fair of her mortality . God forbid that it should be so , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even queens owe God a death . She has a round-wombed woman 's yearning for the greasy succulence of Bartholomew pig . Do n't disappoint her on that score either . " Matthew promised solemnly that he would do all that Cecil had asked . He would try to discern Stubbs 's plan . He would prevent another murder . He would assure the Queen of her bite of pig and her afternoon among her adoring subjects . He pledged fully and honestly himself , but in his heart he asked : How can this be done ? If Cecil perceived Matthew 's self-doubt , he made no sign . A smile of easy assurance returned to his face and he climbed nimblyout of the chair . John Wynn , hearing his master 's movement , now came fully awake . " Good-night , Mr. Stock , and Godspeed you . Both to your room and to the solution of this mystery , " Cecil said . Matthew shook the great man 's hand and wished him goodnighttoo . Then he went out and John Wynn closed the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in a maze of thoughts . He had never entered a room occupied by Sir Robert Cecil but he found himself quite undone by the little man 's presence , which filled the area around him , despite his diminutive stature . The power of the man 's intellect , thep173depth of his devotion to the Queen , and the cunning by which he maintained his place as Elizabeth 's most trusted adviser were evident in every word that passed from his lips . Matthew felt honored that Cecil had so readily taken him into his confidence , and yet he felt such a burden of responsibility  --  both to Cecil and the Queen  --  that he wondered if he could bear it long enough to travel the twenty yards and flight of stairs to where Joan waited , eager , he was sure , to learn all that had happened in his absence . Surely Cecil expected too much of a simple clothier and constable of a country town . Was n't the study of Gabriel Stubbs 's pamphlet the work of a university man , a learned divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of codes and ciphers ? Still groggy from sleep , holding the candle aloft to confirm that it was indeed her husband at the door , Joan greeted Matthewwith an embrace and kiss . " In good time , " she said . " I must have fallen asleep . What hour is it ? " " Past midnight now . " " God save us . What was the business of utmost importance whereof the host spoke ? " While Matthew made ready for bed , he told Joan in whose company he had been . She was surprised . Cecil here ? In Smithfield , at the Hand and Shears ? Joan , lying in bed again , her head propped up on the bolster , listened intently . Then she said , " The great Sir Robert Cecil . While I slept ! " Matthew told her about Cecil 's instructions , how Matthew was to unravel it all , Stubbs 's plot , whatever it was . " If we can anticipate his next move  --  " " The next move of a lunatic ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to logic . I am to turn scholar , study the pamphlet itself , and ferret out his method . " " Method ? A most murderous raving method to stab and desecrateas Gabriel Stubbs has done , " she said.  | " And babbling of Satan , " he muttered . " Of Satan ? " " The author of the pamphlet , Richard Foxworth , says that Satan adopts many disguises  --  like a stage player . In these he appears among the wicked and sometimes among the righteous too . In his scribblings in the margins of this same pamphlet , Stubbs wrote of how he had seen Satan in one form or another , many times . " " In dreams and visions undoubtedly , " she said . He slipped into bed at her side . " In waking , rather . As he walked . The puppet master must have been such a one , at least to Stubbs 's crazed mind . " " And Jack Talbot and Simon Plover too ? " she asked . " So Stubbs may have supposed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and well . He had seemed a companionable sort , not a bad-looking man , although his complexion was somewhat mottled and his beard untrimmed . Certainly he was no devil incarnate . Who would be next ? Matthew jabbed and poked the bolster , shaping it to his liking , shifted his body in the bed until he was comfortable . The chamber was stuffy and overly warm ; exhaustion was a blessing , since the mattress left something to be desired too . " What are you going to do ? " she asked . " Sleep , that 's what . " " Sleep , yes , " she murmured . " My feet are sore beyond belief from all that walking , " he said . " I have twelve good hours yet , according to Sir Robert . Twelve hours before the Queen visits the fair or is informed that a maniac is loose and her chief minister and other servants have been unable to apprehend him and provide for her security . Still I am determined to sleep through a quarter of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too tired to read now . Let the perverse treatise of Foxworth go hang . " He rolled over on his side ; the bed quivered as his body molded itself into the mattress . " We 'll study the work together , " Joan said . She blew out the candle.  |p175By  the first shaft of gray light , Joan and Matthew took turns reading from Richard Foxworth 's dreary treatise . From time to time one of them would pause to remark upon a passage of the text , a point of doctrine , or a comment of Stubbs 's , penned into the margin in the young Puritan 's small , crabbed hand . Their examination confirmed Matthew 's earlier impression that Stubbs , if not a trained scholar , was at least that way inclined . Stubbs had totally absorbed the learned divine 's thoughts , acceptedunquestioningly his arguments , even gone beyond him in carrying Foxworth 's doctrines to their logical conclusion . And so at the moment  --  in Joan 's hands now , for her turn had come  --  she held the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and a single hysterical vision of satanicevil and infiltration into the normal courses of life . But here was mind-numbing work indeed , this close study of a document of increasing repulsiveness , and Joan was aware that despite the seriousness of their purpose her husband 's attentionhad flagged . He was half-listening , and sometimes dozing , for during the night both husband and wife had slept fitfully . Duty had now depressed her husband 's spirits , and he lay sprawled upon the bed , half-dressed , in an attitude of quiet resignation to his failure . But then her eye fell upon something on the much besmirchedpage . She ceased to read aloud and reread the lines to herself . " Why have you stopped reading ? " he asked from the bed , his eyes closed . " Is there something there ? " " A clue at last , " she said . She read the lines  --  a part of a larger passage  --  again , slowlyp176and with emphasis . Then she read the whole text of which the line was a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one of Foxworth 's favorites , and it spoke of a Great Whore with whom the kings of the earth had committed fornication . It spoke of scarlet raiment , gold and precious stones , and a golden cup . This same Whore had drunk from the cup the blood of the saints . She had become drunken with the blood of the saints . " The saints , " Joan said . " Mark that , Matthew . Do the sanctified brethren not commonly refer to themselves as saints ? This same Whore has drunk their blood . She is their enemy , Gabriel Stubbs 's enemy , and he hers . " " And so ? " he said , prompting her on . She had his attention now . He was sitting up in bed , his head thrust forward . Joan now read the comment Stubbs had wedged into the margin of the same page in his tiny handwriting : " A goodly imageof our most prideful Queen , this scarlet whore , yet she too God will judge . " " Certain it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Joan had finished reading and looked up at him for his response . " Vengeance is mine . Judge not lest ye be judged . He 's orthodox on that point of doctrine . But the rest is gross slander . Yes and treason too , since it is written against the Queen . " " I'faith it is treason , " Joan declared with equal conviction , her eyes falling again to the page . " But see , here 's more . Here a Scripture is cited . " " No marvel that , the pamphlet is full of it , " Matthew said . " Have n't we read enough ? Stubbs has convicted himself with his own words . Had he drawn no other blood than a flea 's and written such words he would go to his hanging and no jury would have thought twice of it . Surely this man is a danger to Her Majesty . " " John , chapter and verse , " she said . " That alone . " " Which chapter and verse ? " " Chapter eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text , nor did Joan . " It probably is n't important , " he said . " If it were , Stubbs would have writtenp177it out . He 's capable of infinite pains in such matters . His treasonousslanders are enough evidence for me . " Matthew had found where he put his shoes the night before and was now bent over tying the laces . " But the verse may be important too , " she protested . " The rest of it was . We must find a Bible . " He looked up and made a wry face . " What ? Here in Smithfield ? As well look for a virgin in the great Turk 's harem . " " Matthew ! " He sighed ; he was eager to send word of this fresh discovery to Sir Robert . He looked at Joan . Well , what did another quarter of an hour matter since the news would be bad and the time was ample for the warning ? " I 'll go ask the host , " he said doubtfully . He went downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great room of the inn . Matthew felt foolish asking the man for a Bible . Where did he think he was , in church ? Or at one of the universities where books were as common as beggars , or at the bookstalls at Paul 's where they lay stacked like cordwood ? Besides , the host did not look the sort of fellow that would own a Bible . The host looked up from his rasher of bacon , seemed perplexedfor a moment by the strangeness of Matthew 's question , and then answered , " A Bible , Mr. Stock ? Holy Writ , you mean ? Well , no , sir . I have none , nor prayerbook either . None is provided , sir , " he said , as though Matthew had asked for clean linen or a second chamber pot . " But there is a learned man residing here . A man of the church . He might own a Bible , sir . Yes , and have it with him too . " The host told Matthew where this clergyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interruption of his breakfast . Matthew went to the room where the clergyman was and knocked . His summons was answered by a thin young man of middle height with sallow complexion and spectacles resting precariously on the bridge of his small nose . Matthew intro/duced himself and asked the man if he had a Bible in his keeping . The clergyman said he owned a Bible of course , but did not have it with him . It was with his other possessions , sent on ahead by carter a week before to a church he was presently to serve in Sussex . He apologized profusely that he could not be of service but offered spiritual counsel if that was what Matthew wanted . He also said he had a prayerbook and was reading it at the very moment Matthew knocked upon his door . Matthew decided not to be too explicit about his motives . " A wager , sir , as to a certain biblical verse , nothing more . " The clergyman laughed . He was a good sort who was not above a wager himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good memory for verses . Try me , sir . " " The Gospel of John . The eleventh chapter of the same and the fiftieth verse . " The clergyman thought for a moment , then smiled with satisfaction . " Ah , yes . The words of Caiaphas the high priest . Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not . " " You 're sure ? " Matthew asked , somewhat skeptical at the readiness with which the young clergyman had fetched the passageforth from his memory . " Absolutely , " replied the clergyman . " My memory , I assure you , is excellent for such things . When at Oxford I preached once a sermon on the very text , which was much praised . A bookseller there wanted me to print it . He assured me it would sell very well . " " I 'm not sure I understand the verse , " Matthew said , somewhatcautiously , for he hoped his ignorance of Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew to sit down in the plainly furnished room and offered him a cup of wine . For the next quarter of an hour the clergyman discoursed upon the text in question , much to Matthew 's discomfort , for he wanted to getp179back to Joan but as he listened , the meaning of the Gospel text became clearer . " The wicked Caiaphas prophesies of the Lord 's sacrifice , quite despite himself and in the darkness of ignorance , for he himself was an unbeliever  --  a Jew of obdurate heart . Yet he understood the truth of this proposition , that it is better for one man to perish than a whole nation suffer in unbelief . " " I suppose the same might be argued of a woman , " Matthew said . " What , sir ? " exclaimed the clergyman , sitting erect in his chair and regarding Matthew suspiciously , as though he had just advanced a novel heresy . " The principle would hold , would it not ? " Matthew continued . " For a woman  --  say , a woman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands , and perhaps more ? " The clergyman considered the proposition , making a thoughtful face . He removed his eyeglasses and dangled them at the end of his fingers . " Why , I suppose it would , " he answered at length . " Logic would dictate it , since the distinction between male and female is beside the point , which point pertains rather to the good of many as opposed to that of one alone . " The clergyman now warmed to this new theme , but Matthew was afraid to delay further his return to Joan . He hastily thanked the man for his information and was at such pains to get back to his own room and reveal to Joan what he had now concluded concerning Stubbs 's motives that he nearly broke his neck bounding up the stairs . " So , " she declared triumphantly when he had told her all . " The pieces fit . " " They do indeed , " he said , still breathing heavily from his climb . " I must send word to Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay . This verse and Stubbs 's comment in the margin lend substance to his own surmise  --  that it is the Queen herself for whom Stubbs lurks . She must on no account come to Smithfield . "  |p180Matthew  was about to arrange for such a message when a rapid knocking was heard at the door . Matthew opened it and saw one of Grotwell 's officers standing there . The man 's expression was excited . " What is it ? " Matthew asked . " Another murder , Mr. Stock . The sergeant says you are to come straightway . " " Come where  --  to whom ? " Joan asked , coming up behind Matthew and peering suspiciously at the young officer . " To the bear garden in the fair , " the man said . " Who is dead ? " Matthew asked , almost fearing to learn . " It 's the bearward himself , sir . " " Which ? " Joan asked with sinking heart . " Mr. Crisp or Mr. Babcock ? " " Mr. Babcock it is . He 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreadful sight to behold . "  |p181Shocked  and grieved at the news of his friend 's death , Matthewdid not , however , proceed at once to the bear garden as he was inclined , but first secured paper and pen to compose a message to Cecil . Babcock , he realized , was now beyond help , his soul in heaven , but the Queen remained in jeopardy . He wrote quickly and awkwardly , informing Cecil of the bearward 's murder , inferring from the fact that Stubbs was still at large , and conveying as best he could the sum of Stubbs 's slanders and threats against the Queen . He did not repeat the slanders word for word , but couched them in milder language , for God forbid the very phrases of the young Puritan , so grossly treasonous that they fouled the lips to utter them , might have been construed as his own . He tried to make it perfectly clear that the danger to the Queen persisted , and he hoped in his heart that Cecil would be moved to call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such recommendation . That would not have been his place . Matthew sent the message by the host 's boy , whom the host declared was as faithful in such office as the Queen 's courier and fleeter of foot through the London streets . Then he and Joan left at once for the bear garden . A crudely lettered notice , chalked on a plank and fixed on the gate of the bear garden , announced that the morning baitinghad been canceled . Matthew and Joan went directly to Samson 's tent . Pullyver , Chapman , and Babcock 's dour daughter , Juliet , were already there . So were Francis Crisp and the sergeant 's man who had brought word of the death . They were standing silently , turned away from the body that Crisp had found , crumpled in his nightshirt , inside of Samson 's cage . Top182Matthew , Francis explained that his former partner had spent the night with the bear , there being no other watchman . The dead man now lay outside the cage ; Crisp had pulled him out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife as to be almost unrecognizable . It was a sight to chill an executioner 's blood . The body had been discovered with the poniard protruding from the wounds made in the dead man 's back . The weapon had since been removed and now lay next to the body . While Matthew listened to Francis Crisp 's sobbing account of the discovery of his friend and partner , Joan quietly took in as much as she could of the reactions of the others present . Pullyver was comforting Juliet , who was dry-eyed but obviously distressed  --  if not by her father 's death , at least by the sheer horror of it . Chapman appeared to be sick and kept rubbing his lips with a handkerchief . His face was white and glistened with sweat . Grotwell 's man stood with his hands folded behind his back like a guard at rest , since he was not himself empowered to investigate . Upon Matthew and Joan 's entering , he had informedthem that Grotwell and others of the watch had immediatelycommenced a new search of the neighborhood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh . Matthew was kneeling down beside the body , his eyes avoidingthe dead man 's face . He saw the poniard and picked it up . " J.F. , " he said . " What 's that , sir ? " asked Grotwell 's man , concerned that the clothier of Chelmsford might be tampering with evidence . " J.F. Those were the initials of the dead puppet master . James Fitzhugh . It 's Fitzhugh 's blade all right . Stubbs 's blade too . " Francis Crisp , tearful and wringing his hands , explained again how he found the body . He said that Babcock had volunteered to spend the night in the tent . " Had I been here , I would have been the dead man , " the bearward remarked grimly . Someone had to watch the bear , feed him in the morning.  | " What hour was he fed ? " Matthew asked , rising . " At sunrise or thereabouts , " Francis Crisp said . " Samson is marvelously punctual in such matters . " Crisp glanced at the bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror a few feet beyond and the human grief and confusion around him . " Ned 's being in his nightshirt , " Matthew theorized , " suggests he was killed while he slept . Then dragged into the cage . Stubbs had handled the animal before . He 'd have no fear for himself . He probably thought the bear would finish poor Ned . Thank God he was wrong on that score at least . Curious , though , that he left his weapon behind . " Joan thought this was curious indeed . She said nothing but she thought her husband 's interpretation of events was problematicalat best . Why had n't Stubbs taken the weapon he had used in the three previous murders and that all evidence indicatedhe was yet to use in killing the Queen ? There was something that did n't fit . She stooped to pick up the poniard , which Matthew had placed on the ground again , holding her revulsion in check for the slender blade was still red with Babcock 's blood . She saw for herself the initials carved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What other evidence was needed to tie the Chelmsford murder with that of the bearward and both to the murderous instincts of Gabriel Stubbs ? She noticed that the initials seemed freshly carved in the handle . The grooves were white and clean . She called this fact to Matthew 's attention . " The puppet master may have come by the blade only recentlyhimself . Remember , Joan , he 's but a week dead . What are you thinking ? " " Oh , an idle thought , husband , nothing more , " she said , unsureof what she was thinking but sure that she was not about to reveal her suspicions to the present company . At this moment Juliet Beauchamp announced that she had seen enough , and Pullyver offered to accompany her home.  |p184Cha|pman  said he would go too , but Matthew reminded both men that their aid was needed in identifying Stubbs . He felt sure that upon Grotwell 's return yet another search would be organized . He stopped short of telling them why the apprehensionof the young Puritan was so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected gloomily . " We that never did him any harm at all . " Francis Crisp said that Ned Babcock was as good and honest a soul as ever lived and that he hoped to give Gabriel Stubbs adequate reward for his bloody work the first chance he got . He hoped that the others present felt likewise . " We all mourn Ned 's death , " Pullyver said impatiently . " But these searches are really a matter for the sergeant and his men . We 're citizens , not constables . " Grotwell now returned ; with him were about a dozen men , some dressed in ordinary clothes and wearing the ragged expressions of men dragged from alehouses and brothels for the occasion . " He 's gone to ground again , damn his soul , " Grotwell said , telling the men at his back to remain outside the tent . Matthew asked Grotwell if the Clerk and the Justice had been informed of the new murder . Grotwell said they had been informed and that Justice Baynard was to come presently to view the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been removed from where it was found . Joan asked about Rose Dibbleand was told she had been released from custody an hour earlier . Grotwell was obviously displeased by this development . He said the Justice had found nothing to charge her with , at least not at present . His expression suggested he thought the Justice 's move a foolish one . He said the girl had probably returned to her employer 's booth . " That may be the worse for her , " Joan said . " Pray the pigwomandoes not lay the blame for the new atrocity at the girl 's door , or we may still have murder in Smithfield . " Grotwell asked if Matthew would join them on their rounds of the fair since he knew Stubbs by sight . Matthew said that he would but first wanted to speak to the dead man 's investors . Hep185asked Pullyver what would happen to the bear garden now that Ned Babcock was dead . " The rules of the partnership are clear on that point , " the greengrocer said smugly , shifting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demise , the said partnership is dissolved , terminated , held for nought . The investors may then come forward to securewhat is rightfully theirs , which is precisely what Mr. Chapmanand I intend to do . Samson , the bear garden , and all goods and appurtenances are at our disposal . " " But what of Mr. Babcock 's daughter ? " Joan interrupted to ask , looking at the quiet girl with sudden sympathy . " Will she be left without means ? " " Hardly , " replied Pullyver , casting a proprietary glance in Juliet 's direction . " She has consented to become my wife . After a decent interval , of course . She will be handsomely provided for , I assure you . " Pullyver smiled and seemed not to care that no flurry of congratulationswas extended upon this announcement . Congratulationsdid not seem appropriate , given the circumstances , the bride-to-be 's father sprawled in his gore not a dozen feet away and his killer on the rampage somewhere in the vicinity . Besides , no one seemed to like Pullyver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry . At that moment Justice Baynard , resplendent in a new suit purchased for the occasion of the Queen 's visit , stepped inside the tent , saw the bearward 's body , and uttered an oath of unspeakablevulgarity.  |p186While  Matthew and Joan were at the Smithfield bear garden puzzling over the murder of Ned Babcock , Sir Robert Cecil sat at his desk in his fine house of timber and brick on the Strand , puffing on a pipe full of rich , dark tobacco that filled the air of the spacious chamber with a pale blue haze . Before him , unattended , lay a sheaf of papers . There was a letter from the Spanishambassador complaining about the warlike attitude of certain English sea captains in the Caribbean . There was a recentedict of Parliament touching upon his own family fortunes ( and therefore to be studied at length in a lawyerly way , with scrupulous concern for jots and tittles , commas and semicolons ) . There were also various memoranda and reports of Cecil 's European operatives , his eyes and ears in foreign courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , but neither they nor the pleasure of his pipe could distract him from his chief preoccupation : the Queen 's visit to BartholomewFair and the savagery of Gabriel Stubbs . For but a few hours remained before he must act , and what was he to do ? He considered the alternatives and meditated upon strategies in that methodical way of his . It crossed his mind that he might lie , warn Elizabeth now , and in response to her criticism that she should have been informed before ( oh , much before ! ) , say that he had only just heard of Stubbs , his madness , his menace to the Royal Majesty of England . That would free Cecil from blame . Perhaps . But Cecil was not disposed to lie . By nature he was a diplomatwho handled administrative problems  --  to put the present emergency in a cold , objective light  --  with subtlety and imaginationrather than falsehood . Besides , the lie would be easilyp187detected . The Clerk of the Fair , Justice Baynard , the hulking grim-faced sergeant of the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known since St. Bartholomew Eve . Matthew Stock 's message had come to Cecil by the usual route . Once delivered by the host 's boy , it had passed through a hierarchy of servants like a hot brand , facilitated in its travel by Cecil 's precise and unequivocal instruction to his entire domesticestablishment that anything addressed to him , marked " confidential " and " urgent , " and by the hand of Matthew Stock of Chelmsford , be brought to him immediately , no matter the hour . And so the message had been handled and received , and it now lay with the other papers , on top of them all , read thrice over and therefore memorized already by Cecil . Treason and revenge , Matthew Stock had written , the words standing out boldly . Neither had caused a frisson in this man Cecil  --  renowned for his dispassion  --  much less a mundane emotion like fear . Cecil was accustomed to violence of mind , tongue , and hand from his long sojourn in the corridors of power . Matthew Stock 's message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the madman 's target after all . The Queen to be done in , stabbed to death , a royal sacrifice in the very place where Stubbs 's Puritan martyrs had been burned for their heresies . He might have known ! Were they not all half-crazed , these sectarians ? With their biblical injunctions , sanctified names , and fantastical interpretations and prophecies ? With their sermonsof three hours ' length , their visions , their harangues and wrenchings of the sacred texts of Christendom to suit their mean-spirited ambitions for ecclesiastical power ? He granted that some were tractable as subjects , harmless cranks content to assemble together to sing and pray . But there was the lunatic fringe too , who hated Elizabeth because she steered a middle course between the Scylla of Rome and the Charybdis of Geneva . Who spewed her from their mouths because she was neitherhot nor cold , at least according to their own pernicious estimate . Who hated the Queen finally and most profoundlyp188because she was a woman . A woman who did not stint to dress according to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged her own cult among courtiersand poets , who called her Cynthia and Diana and Gloriana . Heathen names all  --  a heathen queen of a heathen court . They hated her because she checked their mighty zeal  --  detestable word of Puritan cant  --  and because she was not above sending their saints to prison or exile , should their preaching offend . He put out his pipe . His head was beginning to ache , perhaps from the tobacco , perhaps from the complexities of his dilemma . He read Matthew Stock 's message again , despite the fact he already knew it by heart . He agreed that the slander of the Queen coupled with the threat implied in the Gospel verse was adequate evidence of murderous intent . It was the kind of thing that might be read at Stubbs 's trial . If the lunatic were ever apprehended to have one . He cast a cold eye on the clock . It was half past eight . He had been up and dressed since five , had taken nothing for breakfast . He decided he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Whitehall fasting . He could already hear his royal mistress 's bitter complaint : " What , Robin , why had you not earlier warned me ? Here I am already dressed , the coach at hand , the Lord Mayor of London and other notable citizens positively salivating at the prospect of my coming , and here you stand and tell me I must not come  --  not come to the fair  --  because a murderer is afoot and hankers to put a blade in my heart . Is there none among my court I can trust ? " The strident yet beloved voice faded in his imagination . He sighed and turned back to the edict of Parliament , the ambassador'sletter , the reports of his spies  --  all crying out for his attention . But it was no use . He stared listlessly out the open window , the window that looked over the Thames flowing in its solemn majesty . The morning sun shone brightly on thep189gray-green waters . It was a fine August the twenty-fourth . St. Bartholomew 's Day . He called for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would take about an hour to prepare himself . He would go to Whitehall and warn the Queen she must not come , and yet somewhere in the back of his mind he prayed that in the interval the murderer would be apprehended and all would be as before.  |p190Joan  encountered Rose Dibble by accident . The poor girl was wandering aimlessly through the fair , wearing an expression of hopelessness . When Joan greeted her , Rose flinched at her name . She explained that she had been searching for other employment . She was afraid to go back to Ursula 's booth . But Rose had had no luck . The crowd at Bartholomew Fair was larger than ever . Many had come especially to see the Queen and were already jockeying for positions of vantage along the route Her Majesty was to take . Banners and standards had been erected but hung limp in the still air . A scarlet carpet had been laid and everywhere scarlet-coated guards bearing the royal device could be seen , halberds high . Matthew had gone off with Grotwell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to look around for herself . For to her , the search seemed increasingly futile . Stubbs was obviously possessed of animal cunning . If he did not wish to be found , he would not be . It was as simple as that . But the poniard left behind , identifying itself so boldly as to just who had wielded it  --  that puzzled her . Why had Stubbs not taken it with him ? Had he been surprised in the act and fled in confusion ? That did n't seem likely either . It had occurred to her that she might return to the wine seller 's booth , where by light of day some evidence , overlooked by the sergeant and his men in the confusion of darkness , might be found . She asked Rose to keep her company , but the girl seemed reluctant . " Oh , I dare not , " she said . " Come , it 's broad daylight . We 'll not be alone . See what ap191multitude swirls about us . You do n't expect Gabriel will be hidingthere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come , Rose . Your company will be most welcome . Besides , you have nothing else to do . " " But I must dress  --  dress for the Queen , " Rose said . The words spurted forth , as though she had only now remembered the honor conferred upon her of being one of the Smithfield virgins . " The Clerk of the Fair said I must be at the Close and all prepared by twelve o'clock . " " And so you shall , " Joan said . " Besides , that is more than three hours off . Jack Talbot 's booth is on your way . You 'll lose no time by accompanying me . You can well spare the hour . " By day , Jack Talbot 's booth seemed more desolate and forsakenthan ever in its premature dismantlement since the neighboring booths  --  both of herb and spice merchants  --  were doing a steady business . Passersby looked curiously at the wine seller 's booth and then went on . Perhaps some had heard about the murder , and if so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted . But most had not heard , were strangers to the place like Joan , and the abandoned booth with its ruined frontsidesaroused only a mild curiosity as to the whereabouts of its owner and the cause of its ruin . Joan stepped confidently over the rubble . " Come , do n't be afraid . Nothing will hurt you here , not now , at least , " Joan said , leading Rose by the hand . They went inside . Everything was as Joan remembered from the night before . The great mess Grotwell and his cohorts had made in trampling about searching for the fugitive was still there , untouched . Joan stepped over the casks and boxes , inhalingthe lingering scent of malmsey , more faint now than the night before , when the same scent had the strength of a winebibber'sbreath with two gallon or more of the stuff in his belly . Rose stood quietly while Joan looked around . She set some ofp192the casks upright to have a better view , kicked at the matted straw that covered the floor . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Rose gasped behind her . " Why , it 's Gabriel 's knife . " Joan looked at the weapon in her hand , unsheathed it . Its slender blade looked deadly . It was not identical to the one found in Ned Babcock 's back , but it was somewhat similar . The haft bore no marks indicating who its owner might be , and Joan wondered if Rose could be mistaken . But Rose insisted she was not . " It 's his , it 's his , " she cried tearfully . " He 's left it behind . But it proves I never lied to the sergeant . He was here . I spoke with him an hour or more . He showed me the knife in your hand , Mrs. Stock . I was so fearful of it he laid it aside . The blade he drew from his shirt was that one . I swear before God , it 's true . " Joan searched the girl 's face and found nothing but the honesttruth in her expression . So this was Stubbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or was the treacherous instrumentfound in Ned Babcock 's back someone else 's ? Someonewho wanted to make it appear Stubbs was the killer ? Joan was considering this intriguing idea when her eye fell on a patch of straw that seemed not only trampled but moist . Still clutching the hasp of the poniard , she knelt down to examine the straw . She had earlier supposed a great quantity of wine must have been spilled during the invasion of the booth and now realized that there were no broken casks in sight . Two large butts in the back parts were upright and apparently unopened . Now this moist straw , confirming that a spillage had occurredthe night before , hence the overpowering odor of malmsey . She traced the dimension of the spillage until she came to the upright butts . She knocked on the first of the two and heard the dull thud indicating its fullness . But the second gave a different report : the knock was hollow . At that moment Joan 's investigation was interrupted by the sound of creaking cart wheels outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to pedestrians to make way for thep193cart and its load . She heard the rough tread of workmen 's boots and a moment after two shabbily dressed men entered and , without asking who Joan and Rose might be , announced that they had come to remove the wine seller 's stock , for the man himself was dead by report and the goods were to be put into storage until it could be determined if there were any heirs or outstanding claims . One of the men , a red-faced , muscular type with shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows , asked Joan 's permission to proceed with the work . He said he had come on the orders of the Clerk of the Fair . " Mr. Rathbone ? " " The very same , ma'am , " said the shirt-sleeved man . He nodded to his companion , who was shorter , had thick , curly hair , and wore a dirty jerkin . " Do as you will , " Joan said . The women stepped aside as the men proceeded with their task , hefting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all and marching forth into the lane to load the same onto the cart , which Joan could see was already piled high with gear of every sort . While the men worked , they commented on the wine seller 's inventory , which they obviously envied . They seemed , however , to be honest men , not prone to make a simple job into an occasion for larceny . They saved the malmsey butts for last . Joan asked them what they intended to do with them . The butts were large and would hardly fit upon the cart unless everything were taken off and restowed . The taller of the men looked puzzled ; he had clearly not considered the difficulty Joan now called to his attention . The two men briefly discussed what was to be done . " Ay , they 're both as heavy as rock , " said the shorter man , looking at the butts and shaking his head . " We shall have to come back for t' other ones , " said the taller man , with a sweaty smile of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan regarded the wine butts . Heavy , were they ? The both of them ? And yet one , she now suddenly remembered , had sounded hollow.  | " I would like to see inside that one butt , " she said to the taller of the men , who seemed to be chief . " Why , mistress , will you have a drink ? That 's a mighty thirst , I warrant , " said the short man . The tall man laughed at the thought . He wiped his mouth and said he was thirsty too . But Joan quelled his merriment with a stem regard . " I only wish to look inside , " she said icily . " Not a drop shall be wasted or drunk , I swear it . I think some of the wine spilled in the booth yesternight , for see how the straw all about is still moist and sticky too . What , will you store spoiled wine , if that 's the case , or go to the trouble of hauling an empty or halffilledwine butt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin thoughtfully . He cast an appreciative eye on the slender form of Rose Dibble . The girl was as still as a mouse . " Well , " he drawled , " I suppose it will do no good to store ruined malmsey or half-filled butts . I 'd be glad too to avoid another trip to Smithfield in this crowd . " He looked at the coins Joan had drawn from her purse and that she now held out as an added inducement . " If , on t' other hand , the malmsey is good , sweet , and ample , it could hardly hurt to sample a drop . " " Not a bad suggestion , " Joan said , smiling . The man took the coins and stuffed them in his pocket . " Come , Tom . We 'll take the good woman 's money for our labors , which is in addition to that we contracted for with the Clerk . Since the laborer is worth the hire , our labor is saved . If the malmsey 's good , we 'll all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying of thirst in this weather . " The man called Tom went to fetch a mallet and pry bar from a toolbox in the cart and soon retumed , grinning mischievously . He fit the bar in place and struck all around with the mallet until the lid was loose , then he lifted it off . He , Joan , and the tall man all peered inside at the same time . " Jesus Christ our Lord ! " exclaimed the tall man , blinking with amazement  |p195Aware  that behind her Rose was moving forward to join them in inspecting the butt 's contents , Joan turned quickly and blocked the girl 's vision . She took Rose 's shoulders and in a firm , commanding voice , told her to go fetch her husband . " He 's somewhere in the fair . With the sergeant and his men . Do try to find him . Bring him here at once . " Confused by Joan 's sudden and unaccountable severity of manner and frustrated in her effort to see inside the butt , Rose said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if he will not come , Mrs. Stock ? Or can not come this instant ? " " Tell him he must , " Joan said . " Tell him I am sick unto death or besieged by thieves . Make up an emergency if you have to . Tell him anything , but bring him here straightway . " Joan watched the girl go off and then turned to the men , who were still staring into the butt . " Shall we pull the fellow out ? " asked Tom , his face as white as a sheet . " No hurry , " said his taller companion before Joan could answer the question herself . " He 's as dead as a drowned cat . " Joan did not approach the horrid wine butt for another peek at its appalling contents . Her one glimpse would become a permanentfixture in her imagination , she was sure . Her suspicions had been confirmed . She now understood why the malmsey had been spilled and when . She also knew that Gabriel Stubbs could not have killed Ned Babcock.  |p196Later  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great chamber of the Hand and Shears in response to Matthew'ssummons . This was the room , low-ceilinged and convenientlyfurnished with benches and stools , that was used during the days of the fair for the famous Court of Pie-Powders at which Justice Baynard normally presided . But the Justice , who was one of the dozen in the chamber , was not holding court at the moment . The business at hand was not false weights , bad bread , or some other minor infraction , but murder  --  murder not wrought in passion or desperation or madness but in the cold detachment of reason . Matthew had chosen the chamber because of its privacy , its relative quiet from the hubbub of the fair , and its stout oak door , which could be secured from inside as well as out by lock and key . Present also in the room were the other principals in the Stubbs 's matter  --  Francis Crisp , Ralph Chapman , John Pullyver , and Juliet Beauchamp . With them were Rose , Ursula , the pig-woman , and Esmera , the fortune-teller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of a simple plain gown that made her appear , except for her wine-dark coloring and height , no more sinister than any other London woman of her age on holiday in Smithfield . Still others present included the Clerk of the Fair and Grotwell and two of his men . The sergeant was sitting in the front of the room next to Francis Crisp . His men were standing by the door keeping a watchful eye on the assembly . All of these , most certainly the women among them , had expressed some bewilderment at the occasion and urgency ofp197Matthew 's summons . But none had refused to come , for Matthewhad made it known that he bore Cecil 's commission . Whereupon Grotwell and his men had gone forth through every lane and back street in the neighborhood , rounding up such persons as Matthew had designated and fetching them to the appointed place , informing each in the process that any denial , excuse , or lingering would be regarded as a transgression with grievous consequences . And in that spirit they had come , bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sat submissivelywaiting what they were to hear . They voiced no protestwhen Matthew ordered Grotwell to lock the door behind the lot of them and deliver unto him the key . Joan found a seat with the others on the hard benches . The persistent rumble of carts and other traffic , the cries of hawkers , and the occasional beat of drums or ringing of bells outside in the street soon faded from her awareness as she focused her attention on Matthew , who had taken his place in the front of the room and now stood , hands on hips in an attitude of authority , facing his little audience like a player on the stage about ready to deliver a soliloquy of some pith and moment . Matthew began with an announcement , delivered in his typicallystraightforward manner and without emotion , as though the news touched upon no one present in any meaningful way . He told them Gabriel Stubbs had been found , drowned in a malmsey butt in the very booth in which he had taken refuge the night before . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a sneeze , then an explosion of voices expressing wonder and approval . Wonder that Stubbs was dead , approval that Matthew , or the Justice , or perhaps even the sergeant had somehow brought it about . Those , like Chapman and Pullyver , who had feared for their lives , now sighed for relief and congratulatedeach other on their escape from danger . Francis Crisp looked pleased that his partner 's death had been avenged , and Ursula was as unable to contain her triumph as the bench she sat on was inadequate as a surface for her immense but/tocks . She rose to her feet and shook her fist at the floor , booming , " Good riddance to the miserable cur ! May he burn in hell . " Esmera sat quiet and expressionless , and Juliet looked grieved as she always did , although it was not clear to Joan , who studied the reactions of the group closely , for whom her grief was intended . Rose , however , seemed truly devastated by the news . When the group had regained its composure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Stock , but is it for this we have been summoned ? " Matthew said , " No , sir , it is not . Stubbs 's death might well have been announced otherwise than I have done it . Fact is , sir , we are here to determine its cause . " " The cause ! " exclaimed several voices at once , including Chapman 's , who added , " Does it make any difference ? It is a godsend to us all , and he who did it may have my thanks and more . " Chapman looked about the room as though the perpetratorof the deed would presently raise his hand to receive the applause of them all , but no one rose to claim responsibility for Stubbs 's death . " He did deserve it , " said Juliet in a low , steady voice so full of hatred that it sent chills up and down Joan 's spine . " For what he did to my father , and to the others . " " And what he might yet have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us , pray , if there is some further mystery requiring light here . Within two hours ' time the Queen and her retinue arrive , and Master Clerk and I must be on hand to meet her . " Matthew assured them that his remarks would be brief . He began to pace to and fro in the front of the chamber while he talked . " You have been called here because the true image of these murders wants one or two additional strokes before the likeness is perfect . I beg your patience . Within the hour our business will be concluded to everyone 's satisfaction . Except perhaps for one among us . That person will not be satisfied . " Matthew stopped in his pacing and studied his audience.  |p199Joan  observed that while no one queried Matthew 's last cryptic remark , almost every face showed that the remark had been heard , and its promise of some startling revelation taken note of . Bewildered and suspicious glances were exchanged . Ursula grumbled beneath her breath , and an air of nervous expectation now replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now dead , " Matthew continued in the same steady voice , " was , as you know , infected in the brain by a religious melancholy of such sort that it led at last to murder and treason . His madness was directed toward this fair itself , which he conceived as Babylon , and even to Her Majesty'sown person , for in his lunacy he imagined her the Queen of that wicked city . He murdered a puppet master on the road near Chelmsford within the week , then came here and did likewiseto Simon Plover and the wine seller , Jack Talbot , for reasonswe may never fathom . Three victims , in sum  --  victims of Gabriel Stubbs and his madness ! " " You count wrongly , Mr. Stock . Surely you have forgotten my partner , Ned Babcock ! " exclaimed Francis Crisp , rising to his feet . " Yes , Mr. Stock , the lunatic must be given credit for four victims , not three , " said the Justice . " My arithmetic is quite perfect , " Matthew replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is that Gabriel Stubbs did not murder him . He could not have . Stubbs , you see , was by then already dead . " " But his knife was found in my father 's back , " protested Juliet , her wonted bitterness replaced by an expression of total confusion . " And his face marked with the claw , " added Pullyver . " What can be more certain proof ? " " The weapon used was not Gabriel 's , although very like his . The murder was done by someone who wanted it to appear as though Stubbs had done it . Someone who thought that in a chain of beastly crimes , a fourth would not be looked into . That someone stands among you at this moment . "
