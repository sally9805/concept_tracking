Jailing idle bureaucrats <P> Never before had Italy 's bureaucracy seemed so diligent , so strangely un-Italian . Government offices were positively jammed with civil servants , so many , in fact , that there was not enough furniture-or enough work-to go around . One frustrated supervisor in the general post office in Rome finally informed his standing army of employees : " Tomorrow everyone will have a chair and a desk . For too many years , we 've been working with too few people . Now everything has changed . " <P> Indeed it has . Historically , Italian bureaucrats have given special meaning to the old expression dolce far niente ( it is pleasant to do nothing ) . Absenteeism was rampant , feigned illness a way of life . In many cases , civil servants who did show up for work arrived late and left early . <P> Enter an anonymous postal inspector who recently spot-checked the mail facilities at Rome 's Fiumicino Airport , one of the more glacial arms of Italy 's infamous postal service . The inspector found only four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened , his report landed on the desk of Luciano Infelisi , a crusading magistrate , who was appalled by the absenteeism . Infelisi began to issue warrants , and he demanded that 20 ministries and state agencies hand over the names of employees with high absenteeism records . Before Italy 's 3.8 million civil servants could say " Per Bacco ! What 's going on ? " they were being upbraided , and some were even led away to jail in handcuffs . <P> First to go was Maria Ferraguto , 50 , who had won bonuses for hard work on her climb to the job of a personnel director in a Rome post office . She was charged with aggravated and continuous fraud against the state , a felony that carries a penalty of up to three years in jail and up to $318 in fines . Her alleged crime : consistently checking in to her office at 11 a.m. and leaving at 1 p.m. , thus working only two of the six daily hours required . Alessandro Vigneri , 29 , police claim , should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own elegant hi-fi store in nearby Ostia , when the cops showed up to woof and tweet . <P> The arrests are just beginning . Ten other government employees in Rome have been put behind bars , and another 278 government employees have been informed that they are under investigation , as are 90 doctors who signed suspect medical certificates . <P> Can Infelisi and his fellow crusaders reverse history ? Many Italians hope so . But Milan 's Corriere della Sera may have sounded the most realistic note . " When the dust has settled , " the newspaper cynically predicted , " everything will be the same as before . "
