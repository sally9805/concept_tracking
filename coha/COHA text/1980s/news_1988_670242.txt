NEW YORK  --  Sound engineer Trudy Schroeder steps in front of the camera to audition for a Pergament home-improvement-store commercial . She was just " discovered , " delivering her actor boyfriend ' s resume to a talent agent . Now she is supposed to read two lines : " I ' m the new cleaning lady " and " I can ' t work here  --  this place is a mess . " Unfortunately , Ms. Schroeder forgets first one line , then the other . She moves out of camera range , then walks when she ' s supposed to stand still . The casting agent , Elizabeth Schaeffer of Kelly &; Case Casting Co. , coaxes her : " Make her meaner . This is a mean maid . " Ms. Schroeder sighs in frustration . " I can ' t help it , " she says . " I ' m nice . " A lot of unlikely people are showing up for auditions these days . TV and radio commercial actors are on strike , but many advertising agencies haven ' t stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take their actors where they can find them . Lawyers are becoming macho beer endorsers , sales representatives are turning into Don Pardo-style announcers , and construction workers are modeling blue jeans . " I sent a man who works at my corner newsstand for an audition for a New York Mets commercial , " says Linda Tesa , the casting director for Della Femina , Travisano &; Partners . " I asked my art director to go to an audition . I even listen to people when I buy at the deli . When you get desperate , you think differently . " The strike began March 21 , when members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists walked out in a dispute over payments for commercials aired on cable TV . Union members and advertisers reached a tentative agreement on a new contract over the weekend . But a guild spokesman says that even if the agreement is approved this week by the unions ' joint board , the strike won ' t be suspended before Friday . That leaves would-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the time when a doctor becomes a movie star and a cab driver changes his life , " says commercial director Bob Giraldi . " A few lives will be changed here . Not a lot , but a few . " David Tetruzziello may be one of the few . Manhattan casting director Joan Lynn " discovered " him when she needed a construction worker for a Levi ' s commercial and decided , because of the strike , to scour the city ' s construction sites for the real thing . About 100 workers auditioned for the part , and Mr. Tetruzziello , a muscular young ironworker , walked away with it . " He never had any acting experience , but he was just great , " Ms. Lynn enthuses . " I think he should pursue this business . I think he would do very well . " Mr. Tetruzziello is still surprised by his good fortune but couldn ' t be happier : " Believe me , it ' s a lot easier than iron working , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casting agents do have other options besides approaching total strangers . Real , nonunion actors also want the parts . Carole Pfeffer put an ad seeking them in a trade publication and was flooded with close to 1 , 000 pictures . But while many of these newcomers are talented people who just haven ' t made it yet , plenty of others are out of work for good reason . " We ' ve got some people who look like serial killers , and we got a few females who sent in half-naked shots . You just can ' t imagine what possessed them , " says Daisy Sinclair , the casting director for Ogilvy &; Mather . The unions have also warned non-union performers that if they audition or take jobs during the strike they may jeopardize their chances of becoming union members when the strike is over . " We ' ve been telling people this isn ' t their big break , " says a guild spokesman . Anyway , he adds , " many of these commercials may never make the air . Nine years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors found many of the commercials unacceptable . " But some commercials are seasonal or just can ' t wait for the strike to end . And besides , most of them pay union scale of $333 a day for shooting , plus additional payments if the spot runs . Under the circumstances , eager participants come from all professions . Casting agent Stuart Howard brought in an Irish waitress for an Oil of Olay audition . Agent Donna DeSeta sent a man she saw in a restaurant to audition for a credit-card commercial and snagged an Asian delivery boy who wandered into her office for a Chinese-sauce audition . And Los Angeles casting agent Sandra Merrill auditioned a list of her mother ' s friends for a Hilton hotel commercial . Casting agent Jack Kelly brought in his nutritionist to read for one commercial , and , with partner Donald Case , toured sushi bars to round up Japanese men for another ad . To cast a utility commercial that called for senior citizens , the two raided a nearby rest home and called in their bookkeeper ' s mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates range from two to four times longer than normal casting requires . But the real trouble starts once they ' re found . A reporter sitting in on a number of auditions is treated to " actors " who are so fidgety they can ' t stay in the camera frame , so nervous they forget one-line scripts and so green they can ' t figure out how to follow cue cards . To be fair , even a commercial with no speaking part is a lot harder than it looks : Imagine staring at a camera while picking up a soft-drink can , smoothly swiveling in profile to show off the label , and drinking down the soda without letting any of it dribble . At one studio , a button-down lawyer changes quickly from his yellow power tie to a polo shirt to audition for a beer commercial . A young marketing executive wants the part , too ; he ' s here , he tells the casting director , because he was a hurdler in college and understands that the commercial refers to hurdling . " Hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the young executive says , crestfallen . " Does that mean I shouldn ' t audition ? " Nearby , Ms. Lynn is casting a commercial for a major magazine . ( Afraid of angering the unions , the magazine and the actors ask that their names not be used . ) A sales representative , who is trying out as an announcer , first talks too slowly , then stumbles when asked to speed up . So self-conscious is his carefully modulated announcer ' s voice that at times it resembles a " Saturday Night Live " parody . " The script is so pitchy in nature . Break it up a bit , " instructs the spot ' s director , Tim Devitt . But despite his difficulties , the blue-suited businessman is hooked . After 14 years in the electronics distribution business , mostly in sales , he says the strike has changed his life . " I figure that with my selling experience , I could sell myself , " he says , adding , " as a sales rep I ' ve been acting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
