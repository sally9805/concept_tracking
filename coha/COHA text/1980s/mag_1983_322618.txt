A story of intransigence , infighting-and perhaps missed opportunities <P> With their walkout in Geneva , the Soviets abruptly ended a complex and controversial episode in the history of arms control . Even if they eventually return to the bargaining table , it will almost certainly not be until after they have taken the military " countermeasures " that Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov listed last week . That escalation in the arms race would require significant changes in the negotiating approach of both sides . <P> The record of the past four years has been one of almost unremitting Soviet intransigence , intimidation and occasional doubledealing of the sort that so dramatically ruptured the relationship between the chief negotiators at the end . The U.S. stance was weakened by indecision , bureaucratic infighting , the clash of personalities and , possibly , missed opportunities to make progress despite Soviet stonewalling . Much of what went on behind closed doors , in both Washington and Geneva , has never been told before . TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott has been able to chronicle that story . With the secrecy-shrouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published . <P> The threat of a Soviet walkout has been there from the beginning . In December 1979 , immediately after the Western allies adopted their " two-track " decision-to prepare for missile deployment while negotiating on a possible agreement to reduce the number of intermediate-range weapons in Europe-the Kremlin warned that NATO had " destroyed the basis for talks . " The Soviets maintained that the stationing of any new U.S. missiles was unacceptable because it would upset the balance that they claimed already existed in Europe . They proposed a freeze : the U.S.S.R. would halt further deployment on its side in exchange for NATO 's cancellation of its plans to install a new generation of nuclear weapons in Europe . <P> Moscow 's position was both bogus and brazen . It was the Soviet Union that had upset the balance in the first place by deploying the mobile , triple-warhead SS-20 ballistic missile . The West Europeans urged Washington to redress the imbalance by getting the Soviets to cut back on their SS-20s while NATO evened the scales with some new weapons on its side . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of a moratorium on SS-20s , they pushed ahead to complete new missile sites that had previously been under construction . <P> Underlying Soviet arithmetic and diplomacy was an attempt to undermine the very basis of the Atlantic Alliance by breaking an important bond between the U.S. and Western Europe . By opposing the addition of even one new intermediate-range warhead in NATO countries , the Soviets hoped to deny the U.S. the right and the ability to treat the defense of Western Europe as an extension of American self-defense . <P> <P> OPENING SKIRMISHES <P> In the first weeks of 1981 , the newly inaugurated Reagan Administration was divided over whether to go ahead with either track of the NATO decision , deployment or negotiation . At a meeting in February , Richard Perle , the hawkish congressional staffer who would soon become the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy , called the NATO initiative that had been approved by President Jimmy Carter " a lousy decision if ever there was one .
