Wayne Martin , 23 , a lanky college senior majoring in industrial engineering , has good reason to be cocky . Out of 20 job interviews this spring , he landed 17 offers . Feeling as finicky as a baseball free agent , he spurned IBM and General Electric in favor of a $26,000 post with Westinghouse . <P> A decade ago , such heated corporate competition for an engineering prospect was usually reserved for graduates of renowned schools like Caltech and M.I.T. No longer . Martin attends the Rochester Institute of Technology , a respectable but hardly prestigious college nestled in a wooded area south of New York 's third largest city . R.I.T. is one of many once overlooked schools that are riding high on the wave of corporate demand for engineers . Enrollment in its engineering division has nearly doubled in the past ten years , to 1,633 , and despite the recession , all but 20 of this year 's 425 graduates already have job offers . <P> Throughout most of its 152-year history , R.I.T. has been a modest technical college known chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties to Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester . Until a few years ago , students came primarily from New York and surrounding states . Now the explosion of job opportunities in technological fields has suddenly made R.I.T. an educational mecca . This year 's enrollment includes students from 48 states and 45 foreign countries . Admissions officers , who once accepted nearly all comers with a C average in high school , boast that they turn down as many applicants as they take . <P> R.I.T. puts special emphasis on computer science . Last month it became the first school in the U.S. to offer a bachelor 's degree in microelectronic engineering , which is the art of constructing complex computer circuitry on tiny silicon chips . All R.I.T. students are required to learn how to operate a computer , whether they are majoring in electrical engineering or hotel management . Says R.I.T. President M. Richard Rose : " We 're moving into a different society . In the year 2000 the liberally educated person is going to have a strong technical background . " <P> The R.I.T. students are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus politics . They spend countless hours in the school 's 15 laboratories , which are humming from 8 in the morning to 10 at night . From the start , an R.I.T. education is geared toward the molding of marketable skills . In fact , students are periodically required to leave school for an academic quarter to fill temporary jobs at nearby companies , including Kodak and IBM . R.I.T. 's energetic placement office generates ten-year forecasts of the number of jobs that will open up in the different branches of engineering . Those studies show that R.I.T. graduates should continue to be in demand , even in a down economy .
