Corporate nannies watch youngsters for parents on the job <P> Though Pamela Cortez returned to her secretarial job shortly after giving birth to Daughter Kimberly , her thoughts stayed at home . As a result , her work suffered . Recalls Cortez : " I went through several baby-sitters trying to find a good one . I worried during the workday and found my mind drifting to my child . " But now Cortez finds it much easier to concentrate on her job . Each weekday morning Kimberly , 2 , rises at 6:30 and accompanies her mother as she drives to work at Wang Laboratories in Lowell , Mass . Near by , in a former grade school leased by Wang , the toddler spends the day learning , playing and napping with 215 other youngsters . Says her mother : " I feel very comforted . Kimberly already knows her ABCs , she sings songs and she 's very sociable . " Mother and daughter even meet every day at lunchtime . <P> The Cortez family is taking part in one of the costliest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : child care . Says Dana Friedman , senior research fellow at the Work &; Family Information Center : " Corporate-sponsored day care is this decade 's hottest new employee perquisite . " An estimated 1,000 companies now provide child-care assistance to parents , double the number of two years ago . The need springs from such major social changes as the increase in single parents and the continuing movement of women into the work force . In 1970 , two-thirds of U.S. women with preschool-age children stayed at home to watch over them . Today only half do so , according to a report by the Washington-based Bureau of National Affairs . Good professional supervision for children , though , is often hard to find , and the possibility of child abuse is a growing concern . Working parents horrified by a series of sex scandals in day care centers around the country , the most recent involving dozens of children in New York City , prefer company-run programs close to the office , where mothers and fathers can drop by during the day . Indeed , companies that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented employees . <P> Among the first institutions to offer in-house day care were hospitals , which adopted it to help alleviate the nurse shortage . Many other types of firms are following the example . Zale , the jewelry-store chain , last April opened a modernistic , low-slung $300,000 center at its Irving , Texas , headquarters in which a staff of eleven oversees up to 85 children from six weeks to six years of age . At the Matthews , N.C. , headquarters of PCA International , an operator of portrait galleries , about 120 children attend a center that costs the company more than $130,000 a year to operate . <P> Some firms bill their employees for the full cost of day care , but others charge so much less than privately run centers that it constitutes a major bargain . Intermedics , a heart-pacemaker manufacturer in Freeport , Texas , for example , charges its employees $25 a week per child . At its day care centers in Boston and Cambridge , the Stride Rite shoe company bills workers a maximum of $50 a week .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
