One broad issue was how the new Cabinet lineup will decide an important question : Should Britain try to maintain its flexibility to set economic policies , or embrace the goal of becoming part of a more unified Europe by trying to maintain the value of the pound and participating in the evolving European Monetary System ? Mr. Lawson was a leading advocate of the latter , while Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has tended to a more independent stance , even in the face of strong pressure from the rest of Europe. // The answer to the question would most immediately affect Britain ' s monetary policy . The country faces a persistently high inflation rate , now 7. 6 percent , and a slowing economy . To help the economy in the longer run , Mr. Lawson had been holding interest rates up to try to reduce inflation and keep the pound from falling against major European currencies , especially the West German mark. // // Concern About Policy // The markets are uncertain as to what extent John Major , the former Foreign Secretary who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same course. // Analysts said investors seemed to be leaning toward the view that the Cabinet change would not mean a significant difference in Government policy . Still , many economists think that without Mr. Lawson , the Government will be more loath to raise interest rates and might even try to bring them down faster . In the last 16 months , the base rates on bank loans have soared to 15 percent from 7 percent , making life tough for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages and businesses. // The analysts also wonder whether the Government will be as determined to maintain the value of the pound against other currencies. // Some executives and analysts expressed hope that Mr. Lawson ' s departure would end the uncertainty over the future course of the Government ' s economic policy . Sir Alan Walters , Mrs. Thatcher ' s economic adviser , who also resigned on Thursday , helped create that uncertainty by openly disagreeing with Mr. Lawson ' s monetary policies . Mr. Lawson attributed his resignation to Mrs. Thatcher ' s refusal to dismiss Sir Alan . <> <> Clearer Picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government stronger in the long term , " said Martin Taylor , vice chairman of Hanson P.L.C. , the conglomerate . " The market will have a better understanding of the policy being pursued . The uncertainty in the market will therefore gradually dwindle. " // Sir Alan had been critical of Mr. Lawson ' s efforts to maintain the value of the pound against the German mark , which he did through interest rates . Sir Alan argued that the pound should be left to find its own level , and that to do otherwise could hurt the economy or feed inflation . For similar reasons , Sir Alan also opposed joining the European Monetary System . Mr. Lawson advocated at least taking the first step by allowing the value of the pound and other currencies of European Community members to be coordinated. // While Mrs. Thatcher has agreed to take that step at some point , some economists questioned whether she would ever really do it and felt she shared Sir Alan ' s views . And the Prime Minister has made it clear that she adamantly opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of a single currency for the European Community and a European Community central bank , which she views as infringing on Britain ' s sovereignty. // British share prices and the pound fell sharply early today in trading on the London Stock Exchange and in European currency markets . At one point , the pound dipped below its Thursday close of $1. 575 in New York , where investors had time to react to Mr. Lawson ' s resignation . The markets then stabilized as the Bank of England stepped in this morning as a heavy buyer to support the currency . <> <> Thatcher Offers Reassurance // In an appearance in front of her home at No. 10 Downing Street and at some public functions , Mrs. Thatcher said today that the Conservative Government ' s policies would remain " precisely as they were. " // When asked whether her Government was in a panic , she snapped : " Not at all . Don ' t be absurd " - even though the resignation resulted in the second major Cabinet reshuffling in four months. // But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British newspapers called Mr. Lawson ' s resignation and the Cabinet reshuffling a crisis. // In a brief statement today at his country home in Stoney Stanton , Leicestershire , Mr. Lawson tried not to create more problems for Mrs. Thatcher . " John Major is an excellent and a first-class minister , " he said . " He served as my deputy in the Treasury for two years and I have the fullest confidence in him as Chancellor of the Exchequer . " Since July , Mr. Major had been serving as Foreign Secretary . <> <> ' A Difficult Period Ahead ' // Mr. Major , who had earned high marks for helping to keep Government expenditures down as Mr. Lawson ' s deputy , also stressed continuity . In a speech tonight , he vowed to be a tough inflation fighter . " There is a difficult period ahead , " he said , insisting that inflation must be " stopped in its track. " // On Thursday night , he said : " Monetary policy is tight and is beginning to have its effect . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He added tonight that he would also use tough controls on public spending in his fight against inflation. // Several business executives said they expected the Government to maintain the same economic policies but were worried that the short-term uncertainty stirred up by the resignation would only deepen the nation ' s problems . Inflation is high enough and economic growth has slowed to the point that some economists fear that a recession is imminent. // " Uncertainty is not good for growth and confidence , " said Sir Denys Henderson , chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C. // After their initial drop , the pound and British share prices remained stable . At the opening of trading on the London Stock Exchange , The Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 39. 8 points . It closed at 2 , 082. 1 , down 47. 3 points , or 2. 2 percent . Many institutional investors stayed on the sidelines , said Gavyn Davies , an economist at Goldman Sachs International Ltd. in London .
