The trouble with most great comic figures is that they are desperate to be loved . Woody Allen has the opposite problem : people are desperate to love him , and that perturbs his essentially wary and austere nature . Every so often he makes a so-called serious film , as if to test his own integrity and perhaps that of his audience 's feelings . When he does , astonishment and disappointment are his unfair rewards . <P> September , which Allen wrote and directed , is one of these sticky wickets . After a summer , six people prepare to take their leave of a country house owned by the quakingly vulnerable Lane ( Mia Farrow ) . They include her mother ( Elaine Stritch ) , a bruising emotional bully ; her stepfather ( Jack Warden ) , who is a noisy irrelevancy ; a neighbor ( Denholm Elliott ) who expresses love by being socially obliging ; a best friend ( Dianne Wiest ) who is obscurely tense ; and Peter ( Sam Waterston ) , the ad man who rented the guest cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he did n't finish the novel he intended to write there , and he did n't fall in love with his landlady . <P> The role of Peter is exceedingly well written , and Waterston reaches the heights of shiftiness at precisely those moments when he most openly proclaims his emotions . But all these people are relentlessly and statically articulate , especially when they are obscuring motives from themselves and one another . The humor of their humorlessness is often Chekhovian , and the flow of Allen 's camera and cutting , together with the elegance of Cinematographer Carlo Di Palma 's light , grants them a certain grace and dignity . But sometimes the members of this precious circle are too glibly elucidated ; other times they are backed away from silently . In September , Allen is sketching when he means to be etching .
