The fleet heading toward the Falkland Islands is not the only weapon that the British can use against the Argentines . London has already launched an economic attack on its opponent . At Britain 's request , the ten nations of the European Community last week took one of the most dramatic steps in the organization 's 25-year history and agreed to close their ports to Argentine goods until May 17 . Said one surprised E.G. official : " We have done in a day what it usually takes a year to do . " <P> The other big financial gun that Britain has at its disposal is based on the pivotal role that London plays in world finance . The day after the Argentine invasion , the Bank of England froze $1.4 billion in Argentine assets held by London banks . Last week the bank put out clarifications about how the freeze would be administered and indicated that it would not be too heavyhanded . That calmed worried bankers and showed that Britain was not about to declare total economic war . International bankers are very nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to troubled countries in Eastern Europe . <P> Britain 's attempts at economic warfare stand a good chance of working because Argentina is in such a vulnerable position . Its ineptly managed economy is already suffering from 147% inflation , 13% unemployment and a weak currency . The ten European Community countries buy nearly 20% of Argentina 's exports , about $1.8 billion worth in 1981 . Half of this is in food and animals , largely beef , and another quarter is in such raw materials as hides and oilseeds . Argentina can not afford to lose those markets for long . <P> Moreover , Argentina is one of the biggest borrowers on world money markets , owing about $34 billion , and it does not want to lose its credit rating with international moneymen . Just after the crisis started , a team of the country 's bankers flew to the U.S. , where their country owes $9.2 billion , to reassure ten American banks . The U.S. officials listened politely , but remained nervous nonetheless . Said one financier , whose bank is owed more than $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse things are going to get . " <P> One of Argentina 's few important economic friends at present is the Soviet Union . So far this year , the Soviets have bought 2.6 million tons of Argentine wheat , 68% of the amount available for export . The Soviets also will continue being big customers for Argentine corn , sorghum and soybeans . <P> Even though economic warfare has usually not been a useful weapon in diplomacy , especially in the short run , Britain is now in a particularly good position to wage it . Economic sanctions now , deftly managed , could , as the Observer of London said , turn out to be " deadlier than the navy . "
