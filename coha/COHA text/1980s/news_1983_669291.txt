We were in the heart of a continent , at a spot as far out and as far back as you can get in the Australian outback . We had come to Ayers Rock. // Looking down from the 20-seater airplane flying over the desert , relentlessly flat except for an occasional salt-encrusted lake or a dry riverbed snaking through the dust , the sudden appearance of the massive form of red sandstone caused me and my fellow passengers to gasp . Nothing , not all the photographs we had seen of it nor all the travel literature we had read , was preparation for the first sight of what aboriginal man calls the Uluru and what European man more prosaically calls Ayers Rock. // Perhaps it is this impact , the jolt of seeing one of the earth ' s most dramatic protuberances in the midst of one of its flattest , most monotonous terrains , that lured over 100 , 000 visitors to Uluru National Park last year . Along with the Great Barrier Reef , Ayers Rock , standing 1 , 143 feet high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s two most-visited natural wonders. // Those tourism statistics are remarkable when you consider that Uluru National Park , even if you live in Australia , is a long way from just about anywhere . Located nearly in the middle of the continent , the part of Australia ' s Northwest Territory called the Red Centre , the nearest town is Alice Springs , 200 miles to the northeast . The large cities along the coast , where most Australians live , are many more hundreds of miles away , both in distance and in spirit. // For my traveling companions and I , the arrival at Ayers Rock had come at the end of our tour of Australia , one that took us primarily to those coastal cities . Like most North Americans , we were both very curious and very ignorant about what the Australians term the ' ' outback , ' ' the ' ' bush , ' ' or , most mysteriously , ' ' the great back of beyond . ' ' Those terms , we learned , refer to nearly the whole interior of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the glass office buildings and manicured parks of Sydney and Perth to find yourself in the outback. // Most of the urban Australians we met had not been as far inland as the Red Centre and seemed to have mixed feelings about all those harsh miles of grasslands , eucalyptus trees , and desert that separate them from Ayers Rock . The outback figures prominently in the national imagination , but it is revered and scorned at the same time. // ' ' The outback , now that ' s the real Australia , ' ' a young executive in Perth told me , awe and enthusiasm in his voice. // ' ' What do you find in the real Australia ? ' ' I asked // ' ' Flies and boredom , ' ' he replied , only half-joking. // I thought of his comment as we disembarked from the plane at the airstrip at Uluru National Park , greeted by a blast of the dry , bake-oven heat that characterizes a typical day in mid-December , the start of the Australian summer . Flies there certainly were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are a constant , swarming annoyance all the same . Boredom , however , was the last thing any of us felt. // Near the airstrip we saw a scattering of small motels and campgrounds , but our ranger-guide informed us that neither they nor the airstrip will exist after next year . That is when the Northwest Territory government will have completed Yulara , a $140 million resort complex just outside the park that will include an airstrip , two hotels , housing for local aborigines , and a center for aboriginal arts and crafts. // Uluru National Park has only been in existence since 1957 ; before that it was part of an aboriginal reserve . And to understand why this park is so special , why it is worth traveling thousands of miles to visit , you have to consider the area ' s sacred meaning to the aborigines as well as the beauty of its landscape. // Ayers Rock and the other great physical feature of the park , a spectacular , dome-shape mountain range called the Olgas , are believed by the aborigines to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Dreamtime . During the Dreamtime half-human , half-animal beings appeared on the earth , a race aborigines believe to be their ancestors . As the Dreamtime ended , Ayers Rock and the Olgas rose from the flat earth and the ancestors were transformed into part of the new landscape. // And so while nonaborigines look at Ayers Rock and the Olgas and see impressive rock formations that the wind and rain have marked with craters , outcroppings , and ravines , the aborigines look at them and see the lives of their ancestors , great canvases illustrating their past . For example , the potholes found along the southern face of Ayers Rock are believed to be where the Liru , or poisonous snake people , threw their spears . Some of the caves in Ayers Rock are believed to be the camps of the Malas , or ' ' hare wallaby people ' ' ; the bolders crumbling away from Ayers Rock and the Olgas are believed to be the ancestors themselves. // A community of aborigines still live in traditional camps in reserve settlements near the park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the features of their sacred Uluru and also providing insights into the nomadic , food-gathering life style that has allowed them to survive in this impossibly harsh terrain for an estimated 40 , 000 years . On the Bush Tucker Tour , for instance , aboriginal guides demonstrate how one can find food - and cook it - in the midst of the desert. // Although not an aborigine , the young ranger who took us for a tour of the park was , nevertheless , well-versed in aboriginal mythology as well as the region ' s plants , wildlife , and geology . After we climbed into a small van , heading first toward the Olgas , located some 20 miles west of Ayers Rock , he filled us in on aspects of the strange new world stretching for incomprehensible distances on either side of the red sand road. // The region in which the park lies is sometimes called the ' ' dead heart ' ' of Australia , but we quickly saw how inaccurate a name that is . Among the gnarled , twisted trees growing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are common all over Australia . This is a particularly tough variety called bloodwood that can survive on just seven inches of rainfall a year . Among the bloodwoods are the shorter desert oaks , or casuarinas , with long and shaggy needles that almost obscured their trunks . Everywhere there was something in bloom , particularly bushes of the yellow hibiscuslike honey grevilleas , which contain a sweet nectar that the aborigines suck right from the flower. // As we neared the mountains , we saw that their sandstone surface is red and green ; in some parts there are black lines zigzagging down the steep sides of the domes . According to aboriginal legend , these lines are tracks of the Liru people , left behind after a war with another ancestral tribe . The most riveting of the domes is a massive one in the foreground known as the Dying Kangaroo ; nearby is a smaller one said to be a lizard comforting it. // In the midst of these formations is the Mt . Olga Gorge , a deep ravine that contains plant life found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are low bushes of wandarrie grass , a shrub that appears to dry and wither away completely , only to spring to life again with the touch of rain. // As we left the car to explore the gorge on foot , we were greeted by the sounds of a desert aviary . A huge golden parrot flew overhead , one of the many types of parrots , including flocks of small green ones that nestle in the gum trees , that live in the outback . Falcons circled above us , and we heard the cry of a magpie and the nasal sound of black- and white-striped zebra finches singing in the yellow-flowered wattle trees . There are , it came as no surprise to learn , 135 varieties of birds in the park. // On the approach to the gorge is a terrain of shale rock on which there are many aboriginal carvings that are still quite legible despite their estimated age of 20 , 000 years . Among the more vivid rock carvings are ones that are a series of concentric circles and others that are three-toed bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike to the end of the gorge , the 3 , 500-foot walls of the Olgas keeping it cool and moist even on a hot day. // Hiking , or ' ' bushwalking , ' ' as it is known in the outback , is a good way to come across some of the park ' s considerable wildlife . Among the many uniquely Australian animals are the wild yellow dogs called dingoes , the ostrichlike emus , and , of course , kangaroos and their smaller cousins , wallabies . Most of the hiking trails in the park were , in fact , created by kangaroos foraging their way through the bush . But because kangaroos and other marsupials are nocturnal , you are unlikely to see them except at dawn or dusk . Our exploration took place when the sun was high overhead , and we saw only their tracks. // The single most popular activity in the park is climbing Ayers Rock , a feat that about 50 , 000 visitors accomplish each year . But on the afternoon we approached it , there was no one scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the cooler months between April and October , or very early in the morning . Among the most fascinating aspects of the rock is the spectrum of colors that it can take on during a single day - golden at dawn , silver when a cloud passes overhead , blood red at noon , fiery crimson at sunset , and blue-violet at dusk. // At the base of Ayers Rock are a dozen or so caves that are lined with aboriginal rock paintings , some just a few years old and others that date back for centuries . Some of the caves are part of the park tours , but others , particularly those still used for initiation rites , are so sacred to the aborigines living in the area that they may not be visited. // The two caves we saw at the northwest base of the rock have been used by aboriginal elders to record daily events . These paintings can be anywhere from 400 to a mere 40 years old , and often the younger will cover up the older ones . They serve the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite abstract and others are in the recognizable shapes of kangaroos , snakes , and other animals . All were created with colors made by taking pulverized rock and mixing it with water , a process that yields shades of red , white , brown , pink , and yellow ocher. // What they symbolize is something less understood than how and why they were created , our guide told us . A white leaflike painting is said to represent the aboriginal social structure , and some of the animal figures are believed to be the record of a great hunt . ' ' But we don ' t know for sure what a lot of them mean , ' ' he said . ' ' The aborigines often prefer to keep the true meaning to themselves. ' ' // As we left the caves , I felt somewhat glad that we couldn ' t learn all the secrets of the Uluru and its enigmatic artwork . The sense of wonder that pervades this heart of the Australian continent is as much a part of it as the landscape itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uluru National Park is from April to October , when the days are warm and the nights cool . At other times of the year the temperature often climbs well above 100 degrees F. and the guided tours of the park are suspended . Until the Yulara resort is completed next year , the choice of accommodations is limited to campgrounds and four modest but comfortable motels. // Alice Springs , a one-hour flight or four-hour drive away , is the major gateway to Uluru National Park . We reached our destination by first flying to Sydney from San Francisco on Quantas , the major carrier to Australia . There is a daily flight that takes 15 hours , including a one-hour stop in Honolulu . From Sydney there are flights to Alice Springs on Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines ; it is a three-hour trip . Airlines of Northern Australia flies to Uluru National Park twice a day from Alice Springs and also offers an overnight tour package. // Further details about visiting the Red Centre are available from the Australian Tourist Commission , 1270 Avenue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilshire Boulevard , Los Angeles , Calif. 90010. // //
