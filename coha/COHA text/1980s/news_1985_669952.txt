I read with interest Frederick C. Klein ' s March 29 On Sports article , " Bad Marks for College Athletics . " As a former basketball player at Tulane ( ' 71-75 ) , and a graduate of its law school ( ' 79 ) , I have been shocked by the news of alleged point-shaving by certain members of this year ' s team . The reason I chose Tulane over other schools with " big-time " athletic programs was that I felt it offered an excellent combination of academics and athletics in a cosmopolitan setting  --  and it did . But at the time I attended , that was the emphasis  --  academics and athletics in that order . Apparently , Tulane lost sight of that balance . Unfortunately , Tulane is not unique in that respect and I suspect is very similar to other schools trying to compete in today ' s world of college athletics . It will surprise no one to learn that the major college programs today are a big business where money is the bottom line . Given that fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , coaches and alumni will continue . Until , as Mr. Klein suggests , our colleges and universities stop admitting less-than-qualified " jocks " in greater proportion than other students and leave the business of preparing them for athletic careers to the pros , I see little prospect for improvement . How nice it would be to see the day when a student athlete chooses the school he would like to attend first and then his sport rather than vice versa . Luther J. Strange III Birmingham , Ala.  --  - Colleges should cancel the season if athletes fail to maintain proper grades . Tougaloo College in Mississippi had the guts to do that last fall . Robert W. Jones New York  --  - The NCAA is in effect trying to act as a cartel to hold down compensation to college athletes . For minor sports and middling-good athletes , room and board are a fairly good equivalent of the market price . But for the stars in major sports , they ' re not . Athletes go to college so as to get a chance at the big money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and for them a physical education degree is a fallback option , while a few jocks are smart enough to make it through regular academic courses such as pre-med or engineering , in spite of the huge demands that coaches make on their time . I ' d recommend that : ( 1 ) If the colleges don ' t want to pay big money , they should split up recruiting areas geographically to make their cartel really work. ( 2 ) College athletes should be allowed to take a part-time course load during the playing season. ( 3 ) Coaches should be forbidden to practice their teams during the off-season terms. ( 4 ) There should be a specific quota of scholarships for injured athletes , and for those who didn ' t make the pros and need one or two more years to graduate. ( 5 ) The SAT entrance cutoff scores should be in several tiers , from the Ivy League down to the community colleges . Even the dumbest jock should have the option of going to a junior college so he can get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow him to go to a top school like the University of Michigan , say , and expect him to compete academically against students all from the top 20% of their high school class . Prof. Glenn T. Wilson Southern Illinois University Edwardsville , Ill.  --  - If Mr. Klein would apply the same logic to business , the recent General Dynamics and General Electric revelations would result in a blanket indictment of the business world . Intercollegiate athletics , like business and government and almost every segment of society , has grown bigger and with this growth has come problems . I only wish that business could have as effective a governing body as the NCAA . Mr. Klein zeroed in on this year ' s NCAA basketball tournament for special criticism . I was proud to have my young sons join me in watching the final moments of the games where Georgetown , St. John ' s , Villanova and Memphis State made it to the final four . The last moments of each game provided them with a great lesson in the joys of winning , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coaches and athletes in the games are the kind of role models that I want for my kids . Let ' s not point to the unfortunate Tulane incident , but let ' s look to the student athletes who play for people like John Thompson in basketball or Joe Paterno in football when we evaluate the worth of college athletics . Michael Braude Kansas City , Mo.  --  - Mr. Klein ' s article needs one clarification . President Bill Atchley of Clemson University resigned when the board of trustees would not support his request to transfer the athletic director to another position in the university staff . Although now-former Athletic Director Bill McLellan could boast of many successes on the field in his reign , the reality of two three-year probations and the drug scandal required drastic action . Many younger contributors to the athletic department ( myself included ) felt a change was needed and were shocked when President Atchley was let down . Several thousand students marched on the athletic complex in protest . Although I did not attend Clemson , I hope that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new athletic director has been appointed already . A university with such high standards as Clemson will not be down for long . Harvey C. Danner Jr . Lenoir , N.C.
