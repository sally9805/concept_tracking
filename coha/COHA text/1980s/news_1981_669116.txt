About 30 women , including a young activist named Alice Paul , had been picketing the White House . The struggle to win the right of women to vote in this country had gone on for nearly 70 years . These women had resorted to militant tactics to gain attention for their cause and to score President Wilson for his opposition. // The police arrested and jailed the women for obstructing traffic ( on the sidewalk ) . // On the night of Nov. 14 , the women  --  some over 60 years old  --  were attacked by guards , dragged to another building and thrown into dark and grimy cells. // Some were released within a few days . Some were detained for nearly a month . Others , including Alice Paul , were force-fed during a 22-day hunger strike. // It wasn ' t the first time Alice Paul had been involved in a confrontation . Since 1913 she and other members of her Congressional Union had staged parades , rallies , and other protests . Sometimes the demonstrations turned into riots when the women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onlookers . And in 1917 police started arresting the White House picketers. // Alice Paul and another suffragist , Lucy Burns , had brought their militant techniques over from England , where they had worked with English suffragettes . ( British suffrage workers referred to themselves as " suffragettes , " while in the United States , they were properly known as " suffragists. " ) // Alice Paul ' s detractors regarded her as quaint at best . A prison doctor pronounced her insane . " This is a spirit like of Joan of Arc , " the doctor declared , " and it is useless to try to change it . She will die , but she will never give up. " // And she never did give up. // Nearly a month after the " Night of Terror , " the last of the imprisoned suffragists was released from jail and charges were dropped . Some hailed the women as martyrs and and heroines . And the protests continued. // Less than three years later , on Aug. 26 , 1920 , the 19th Amendment was ratified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . Some said Alice Paul and her Congressional Union had made the difference . Others felt that they had only alienated support and delayed passage of the amendment. // On Aug. 26 , 1981 , 20 women were arrested at the same location of Alice Paul ' s arrest 65 years earlier . The women were observing Women ' s Equality Day , marking the 61st anniversary of passage of the 19th Amendment . This time the women were demanding passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and protesting President Reagan ' s opposition to the ERA. // The modern-day " Joan of Arc " had filed into Pennsylvania Avenue and resolutely sat down , waiting to be arrested . They sang " We Shall Not Be Moved . " Earlier , they had chained themselves to the White House fence  --  another tactic used by Alice Paul . Then they had sat down in front of the White House gate . When they moved into Pennsylvania Avenue , police charged them with obstructing traffic and hauled them off to a police station . There , the women ' s experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly and fined a nominal fee for disorderly conduct and released. // But the 20 activists made their point . Nearly 60 years after its introduction in Congress , an equal rights amendment still had not been ratified . The time had come , they believed , for militant tactics. // The activists are members of the Congressional Union , an organization of several hundred people founded by a group of women historians and activists at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville , N.Y. , in June 1980 . Members have patterned their organization after Alice Paul ' s Congressional Union . ( Paul ' s Congressional Union later became the National Woman ' s Party. ) // Members of the Congressional Union seek to restore to women a " militant state of mind " through knowledge of their own history , according to Pam Elam , an alumna of Sarah Lawrence and one of the organization ' s founders. // The first priority of the Congressional Union is passage of the Equal Rights Amendment , a concept first proposed by Alice Paul herself and the National Woman ' s Party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort toward ratification of the ERA , members of the Congressional Union have reactivated tactics of civil disobedience used by Alice Paul and members of the original Congressional Union. // ERA " silent sentinels " picket weekly at the White House gate . Like the suffragists , the ERA picketers hold the President and the party in power responsible. // Members of the Congressional Union proclaimed July 4th Women ' s Independence Day and demonstrated at the White House . On Labor Day , they dramatized the labor women often do for little or no pay . And last June , when the Republican Party withdrew its support of the Equal Rights Amendment , activists chained themselves to the doorway of the Republican National Headquarters building. // Militant activities have not been limited to Washington , D.C. Scattered actions took place on Women ' s Equality Day . In Seattle there was a demonstration at a public building . In Orlando , Fla. , demonstrators slowed traffic and urged Disney World visitors to boycott the " unratified " state of Florida . In Salt Lake City a woman climbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Last November 202 women and one man were arrested in Bellevue , Wash. , when they chained themselves to the gate of the newly dedicated Mormon Temple. // Sonia Johnson , a Sterling , Va. , homemaker , is an activist in the Congressional Union . President of Mormons for ERA , Johnson was excommunicated from her church , one of the most powerful opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment . She explained what Alice Paul and the other militants were doing . " They put women first . That ' s what we ' re doing . . . . Unless we take ourselves seriously no one else will. " // Members of the Congressional Union also take their own history seriously , especially the similarities in the battles for suffrage and for the ERA. // Even the wording of the two amendments is similar . The 19th Amendment reads , in its entirety : // " The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. // " Congress shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The proposed Equal Rights Amendment reads , in its entirety : // " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. // " The Congress shall have the power to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article. // " This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification. " // Roots of the suffragists and ERA activists are similar , stemming from the 19th-century abolitionist movement and the 20th-century civil rights movement . Both share a long history of well over 50-years. // The contemporary women ' s movement and that of the 19th century suffered similar ideological splits . The schism of the early women ' s movement , however , was far more serious , lasting over 20 years , from 1869 to 1890. // The National Organization for Women ( NOW ) , the largest and most influential women ' s rights organization today , had its counterpart in the National American Woman Suffrage Association ( NAWSA ) . NOW , like NAWSA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no formal connection with the Congressional Union . NOW prefers to work within the system , as NAWSA did . Both organizations gained grass-roots support for their causes . Recent polls show 2-to-1 support for the Equal Rights Amendment. // Perhaps the most significant parallel can be found in the voting patterns of women . In 1916 Alice Paul ' s Congressional Union urged women in the few states where they could vote to use their ballots against President Wilson for opposing the suffrage amendment . He carried all but two of those states , but in Illinois , the only state where votes of men and women were tallied separately , women voted against President Wilson 2 to 1. // A similar pattern seems to be emerging today . A June 1981 poll showed more women favoring the Democratic Party , which supports the Equal Rights Amendment , while more men favored the Republican Party , which has withdrawn support . Exit polls conducted during the 1980 elections showed men supporting Republican Ronald Reagan by roughly 55 percent to 35 percent , while women split their votes 46 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women ' s rights had a significant impact on the difference in voter preference. // There are also similarities in the funding sources to oppose suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment . Northern political bosses were less than enthusiastic about giving voting power to a major source of cheap labor . Liquor interests pumped vast amounts of money into fighting the suffrage amendment , fearing Prohibition. // Arguments against suffrage strike a familiar note today . Many of those who opposed the vote for women believed in the biblically ordained place of women as caretakers and nurturers , subject to their husbands . If women could vote , it would give them unnatural power and weaken the family , they said. // Howard Phillips , national director of the Conservative Caucus , not only opposes the Equal Rights Amendment , he longs for the days when women had no voting power or property rights . In a speech in the summer of 1980 , Phillips criticized " anti-family " policies , begun " not just in this decade or even in this century , resulting in the liberation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffrage accused activists of promoting a " radical plot " to take over the country . Others claimed that women already had all the rights they needed. // Phyllis Schlafly , head of Stop ERA and one of its most outspoken critics , claims that women already have enough laws on the books to protect their rights . As a writer , editor , lecturer , and political activist with a law degree , she has traveled the country defending the traditional role of women and attacking the Equal Rights Amendment as " anti-family. " // Schlafly has her counterpart in the suffrage movement . Sarah Hale was the editor of " Godey ' s Lady ' s Book , " the most popular women ' s magazine of the 19th century . Hale defended women ' s traditional roles and opposed suffrage , stating , " I consider every attempt to induce a women to think they have a just right to vote as injurious to their best interests and derogatory to their character. " // Southern states , more deeply entrenched in tradition , held out on ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state has ratified the ERA. // Criticism leveled at the suffragists sounds familiar today . Women claiming the right to vote were often called unfeminine , unmarriageable , and intent on destroying the family . The press accused Alice Paul of being " selfish and silly " for picketing the White House while the nation was engaged in World War I. According to her biographer , Amelia Fry , a member of the new Congressional Union , Paul replied , " If a creditor stands in front of a man ' s house , constantly demanding the amount of the bill , the debtor has either to remove the creditor or pay the bill. " // Sonia Johnson describes a " sea of smoldering women " out there ready to " burst into flame. " // " We ' ve been too nice too long , " proclaim some of the buttons worn by ERA activists . They say they are witnessing , one by one , the dismantling of rights they have won . They point to changes in military pension rights , Title IX , and affirmative action as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white gloves , " Sonia Johnson vows. // " There ' s a recipe for justice of any kind , " in her view . " The last ingredient you add is risk . After you ' ve done everything else , then you risk your reputation , your fortune , physical damage , your life . You witness publicly the seriousness of your intent. " // What about the risk of alienating supporters ? Johnson contends they have nothing to lose . " We ' ve lost practically everything anyway. " // Despite the parallels in the efforts for the ERA and for woman suffrage , there are some notable differences . The first is timing . The suffrage amendment was ratified by the states within a little over a year . The Equal Rights Amendment , approved by Congress in 1972 , is three states short of the 38 needed to ratify . The time limit of the Equal Rights Amendment is June 30 , 1982. // Another major difference is the relative complexity of the two issues . The outcome of the suffrage amendment was clear : women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the Equal Rights Amendment remain complex  --  even to the proponents of the amendment . ERA advocates find themselves dealing with issues the suffragists didn ' t have to address : women and the draft , " protective laws , " constitutional interpretations , child custody , and such unrelated yet emotional subjects as abortion and homosexuality. // While the future of the Equal Rights Amendment remains unclear , today ' s " Joans of Arc " pledge not to give up. // Alice Paul , militant suffragist and mother of the Equal Rights Amendment expressed their feeling : " It ' s like a mosaic . Each of us puts in one little stone and then you get a great mosaic at the end. " // //
