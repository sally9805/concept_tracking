Though it is still in an early stage , the shift could set new limits on the sweeping abortion rights granted in the 1970 ' s , when many Western European governments bowed to public opinion and liberalized their abortion laws . Easy access to abortion is now settled social policy in all but three countries. // But anti-abortion groups , once small and poorly organized , have quietly been preparing a campaign across Western Europe to limit or reverse the laws . Angered by what they regard as permissive legislation and increasing scientific meddling in human reproduction , abortion foes have stepped up activities in Britain , France , Italy , Spain and West Germany. // // Awaiting American Decision // Increasingly , they organize conferences , give talks in schools , recruit local groups and have formed at least two international networks tied to similar organizations in the United States . American groups , by their own account , provide European partisans with literature , films and political advice. // As the abortion foes have become more outspoken , they have found new forums for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mostoles , Spain , demanded that a high school religion teacher stop showing his 14-year-old students a film that showed a guilty-looking woman having an abortion and bloody remains of the fetus as children ' s voices cried : " No , Mommy , I want to live ! " // Although Europe ' s conflict over abortion is nowhere near as intense as in the United States , abortion opponents have succeeded in reopening the debate in several countries where , until recently , the issue had seemed closed. // This week , women ' s rights and family planning advocates in several Western European countries said they were nervously awaiting the verdict of the United States Supreme Court , which is currently reviewing the constitutional base for American abortion rights . The American court may rule on the abortion case on Thursday , the last day of its current session. // Reversal or restriction of American abortion rights , they argue , will almost certainly give more impetus to European anti-abortion movements , and some fear it may lead abortion foes to launch a major fight in the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Implications ' // " There is a growing trend here to re-look at the entire abortion issue , " said Mark Laskin , assistant secretary general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London . " The Supreme Court decision may well have serious implications for Europe , though we hope it does not. " // Regardless of the outcome , added Mr. Laskin , whose large federation supports abortion rights , the Supreme Court ruling will almost certainly have an impact on opinion in third world nations , where many women die from botched clandestine abortions and doctors and women are fighting for abortion rights. // In the past two decades , almost all Western European nations have legalized abortion . It remains forbidden in Belgium and Ireland , as well as in Malta . While the law in Belgium is expected to be liberalized later this year , courts in Ireland have tightened it and made it a crime even to provide information about getting an abortion in Britain , as many Irish women do . <> <> Laws and Restrictions // The laws are most lenient in Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden , where women can get an abortion on request . Some countries restrict on-demand abortion to women beyond the 12th week of pregnancy ; in other countries the cutoff point is the 28th week. // France , West Germany and Britain have similar limits , but demand approval of two doctors . Portugal and Spain permit abortion up to the 12th week only if a woman ' s mental or physical health is threatened . In practice though , that definition has been elastic . The Swiss have no such time restriction , but tend to be more strict about what constitutes serious medical grounds. // But factors outside the law , like the will of doctors or access to services , often seem to determine whether women can find early or safe abortions close to home. // In Catholic southern West Germany , women complain of doctors ' delaying tactics and often go to the more lenient northern part of the country or the Netherlands . Swiss women go from the more Catholic cantons to more liberal Protestant regions . Women from southern Italy frequently must travel as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal . <> <> Crossing Borders for Procedure // Of the 184 , 000 abortions performed in Britain in 1988 , official statistics show that 15 , 500 were for other Europeans . Dutch statistics for 1986 cite 18 , 000 abortions for residents and another 18 , 000 for outsiders , 8 , 000 of them from West Germany. // Much of the problem , the women say , lies with the Government . While health departments in Denmark , Sweden and the Netherlands , for example , have enforced abortion legislation by providing facilities around the country , others , like Austria , Spain and Italy , have done little. // But at the same time doctors in Catholic Southern Europe frequently refuse to perform abortions because they have moral objections or feel it harms their prestige . <> <> Push to Restrict Procedure // Some groups dispute the contention that abortion rights can be tampered with in Western Europe , though others disagree. // In Britain , a bill to restrict abortions after the 18th week , instead of the 28th , has repeatedly been defeated . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. // Conservative parliamentarians in West Germany have tried to block Government funds for private pro-abortion family planning groups and have pressed for legislation demanding more counseling in favor of keeping a pregnancy . Recent polls there have also showed that public opinion has shifted somewhat away from the broad approval of abortion of the 1970 ' s , although a majority said the decision should be solely up to the woman. // " Clearly , the question is no longer one with simple yes or no answers , " said Heinrich Sudmann , a spokesman at the Health Ministry in Bonn . <> <> Avoidance in France // In France , where the anti-abortion movement last year succeeded briefly in blocking RU 486 , a pill which induces miscarriage , conservatives are directing their fire against issues like in vitro fertilization and fetal tissue transplants . However , the main political parties apparently want to avoid a divisive issue like opening up a debate on the 1975 abortion law. // In the five Scandinavian countries , among the first to permit abortion , the anti-abortion movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that the liberalization of West European laws on the whole has not increased the overall rate of abortion , some supporters of abortion rights say the time has come to work for earlier abortion and for reducing the present abortion rate . They called for more sex education and greater use of contraception. // Swedish officials said their Government is now giving a great deal of thought to this. //
