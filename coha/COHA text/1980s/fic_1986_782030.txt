 | Anticipation rises higher , however , because I 'm taking my new girlfriend Vicki Arcenault with me . She has recently moved up to New Jersey from Dallas , but I am already pretty certain I 'm in love with her ( I have n't mentioned anything about it for fear of making her wary ) . Two months ago , when I sliced up my thumb sharpening a lawnmower blade in my garage , it was Nurse Arcenault who stitched me up in the ER at Doctors Hospital , and things have gone on from there . She did her training at Baylor in Waco , and came up here when her marriage gave out . Her family , in fact , lives down in Barnegat Pines , not far away , in a subdivision close to the ocean , and I am scheduled to be exhibit A at Easter dinner  --  a vouchsafe to them that she has made a successful transition to the northeast , found a safe and good-hearted man , and left had times including her dagger-head husband Everett far behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 on the Turnpike , and I can not expect he will like the difference in our ages . Vicki is thirty . I am thirty-eight . Ile himself is only in his fifties . But I am in hopes of winning him over and eager as can be under the circumstances . Vicki is a sweet , saucy little black-hair with a delicate width of cheekbone , a broad Texas accent and a matter-of-factness with her raptures that can make a man like me cry out in the night for longing . You should never think that leaving a marriage sets you loose for cheery womanizing and some exotic life you 'd never quite grasped before . Far from true . No one can do that for long . The Divorced Men 's Club I belong to here in town has proven that to me if nothing else  --  we do n't talk much about women when we are together and feel relieved just to be men alone . What leaving a marriage released me  --  and most of us  --  to , was celibacy and more fidelity than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be faithful to or celibate for . Just a long empty moment . Though everyone should live alone at some time in a life . Not like when you 're a kid , summers , or in a single dorm room in some crappy school . But when you 're grown up . Then be alone . It can be all right . You can end up more within yourself , as the best athletes are , which is worth it . ( A basketball player who goes for his patented outside jumper becomes  | nothing more than the simple wish personified that the ball go in the hole . ) In any case , doing the brave thing is n't easy and is n't supposed to be . I do my work and do it well and remain expectant of the best without knowing in the least what it will be . And the bonus is that a little bundle like Nurse Arcenault seems sent straight from heaven . For several months now I have not taken a trip , and the magazine has found plenty for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by X 's sleaze-ball lawyer , Alan , that my travel was the cause of our trouble , especially after Ralph died . And though that is n't technically true  --  it was a legal reason X and I invented together  --  it is true that I have always loved the travel that accompanies my job . Vicki has only seen two landscapes in her entire life : the flat , featureless gloom-prairies around Dallas , and New Jersey  --  a strange unworldliness these days . But I will soon show her the midwest , where old normalcy floats heavy on the humid air , and where I happen to have " gone to college . It is true that much of my sportswriter 's work is exactly what you would think : flying in airplanes , arriving and departing airports , checking into and out of downtown hotels , waiting hours in corridors and locker rooms , renting cars , confronting unfriendly bellmen . Late night drinks in unfamiliar bars , up always before dawn , as I am this morning , trying to get a perspective on things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't suppose I could live happily without . Very early you come to the realization that nothing will ever take you away from yourself . But in these literal and anonymous cities of the nation , your Milwaukees , your St. Louises , your Seattles , your Detroits , even your New Jerseys , something hopeful and unexpected can take place . A woman I met at the college where I briefly taught , once told me I had too many choices , that I was not driven enough by dire necessity . But that is just an illusion and her mistake . Choices are what we all need . And when I walk out into the bricky warp of these American cities , that is exactly what 1 feel . Choices aplenty . Things I do n't know anything about but might like are here , possibly waiting for me . Even if they are n't . The exhila-  | ration of a new arrival . Good light in a restaurant that especially pleases you . A cab driver with an interesting life history to tell . The casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that you are allowed to listen to in a bar you 've never been in , at a time when you would otherwise have been alone . These things are waiting for you . And what could be better ? More mysterious ? More worth anticipating ? Nothing . Not a thing . The barium-sulphur lights die out over the Deffeyes ' tennis court . Delia Deffeyes ' patient and troubleless voice , still hushed , begins assuring her husband Caspar that he played well , while they walk toward their dark house in their pressed whites . The sky has become a milky eye and though it is spring and nearly Easter , the morning has a strangely winter cast to it , as though a high fog is blotting its morning stars . There is no moon at all . The policeman has finally seen enough and idles out the cemetery gate onto the silent streets . I hear a paper slap on a sidewalk . Far off , I hear the commuter train up to New York making its belling stop at our station  --  always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blinking red light at Constitution Street , across from the new library , then inches along the cemetery fence on Plum Road , her lights on high beam . The deer has vanished . I walk over to meet her . X is an old-fashioned , solidly Michigan girl from Birmingham , whom I met in Ann Arbor . Her father , Henry , was a Soapy Williams best-of-his-generation liberal who still owns a plant that stamps out rubber gaskets for a giant machine that stamps out car fenders , though he is now a Republican and rich as a Pharaoh . Her mother , Irma , lives in Mission Viejo , and the two of them are divorced , though her mother still writes me regularly and believes X and I will eventually reconcile , which seems as possible as anything else . X could choose to move back to Michigan if she wanted to , buy a condominium or a ranch-style home or move out onto the estate her father owns . We discussed it at the divorce , and I did not object . But she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | In addition , she is firmly behind the idea of family and wants Paul and Clarissa to be near me , and I 'm happy to think she has made a successful adjustment of her new life . Sometimes we do not really become adults until we suffer a good whacking loss , and our lives in a sense catch up with us and wash over us like a wave and everything goes . Since our divorce she has bought a house in a less expensive but improving section of Haddam called The Presidents by the locals , and has taken a job as teaching pro at Cranbury Hills C.C. She cocaptained the Lady Wolverines in college and has lately begun entering some of the local pro-ams , now that her short game has sharpened up , and even placed high in a couple last summer . I believe all her life she has had a yen to try something like this , and being divorced has given her the chance . What was our life like ? I almost do n't remember now . Though I remember it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fondly . I suppose our life was the generic one , as the poet said . X was a housewife and had babies , read books , played golf and had friends , while I wrote about sports and went here and there collecting my stories , coming home to write them up , mooning around the house for days in old clothes , taking the train to New York and back now and then . X seemed to take the best possible attitude to my being a sportswriter . She thought it was fine , or at least she said she did and seemed happy . She thought she had married a young Sherwood Anderson with movie possibilities , but it did n't bother her that it did n't turn out that way , and certainly never bothered me . I was happy as a swallow . We went on vacations with our three children . To Cape Cod ( which Ralph called Cape God ) , to Searsport , Maine , to Yellowstone , to the Civil War battlefields at Antietam and Bull Run . We paid bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras and insurance , cooked out , went to cocktail parties , visited schools , and romanced each other in the sweet , cagey way of adults . I looked out my window , stood in my yard sunsets with a sense of solace and achievement , cleaned my rain gutters , eyed my shingles ,  | put up storms , fertilized regularly , computed my equity , spoke to my neighbors in an interested voice  --  the normal applauseless life of us all . Though toward the end of our marriage I became lost in some dreaminess . Sometimes I would wake up in the morning and open my eyes to X lying beside me breathing , and not recognize her ! Not even know what town I was in , or how old I was , or what life it was , so dense was I in my particular dreaminess . I would lie there and try as best I could to extend now knowing , feel that pleasant **35;672;TOOLONG sensation I grew to like as long as it would last , while twenty possibilities for who , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right and feel a sense of ? what ? Loss , I think you would say , though loss of what I do n't know . My son had died , but I 'm unwilling to say that was the cause , or that anything is ever the sole cause of anything else . I know that you can dream your way through an otherwise fine life , and never wake up , which is what I almost did . I believe I have survived that now and nearly put dreaminess behind me , though there is a resolute sadness between X and me that our marriage is over , a sadness that does not feel sad . It is the way you feel at a high school reunion when you hear an old song you used to like played late at night , only you are all alone . X appears out of the agate cemetery light , loose-gaited and sleepy , wearing deck shoes , baggy corduroys and an old London Fog I gave her years ago . Her hair has been cut short in a new-style way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown-haired and pretty , who looks younger than she is , which is only thirty-seven . When we met fifteen years ago in New York , at a dreary book signing , she was modeling at a Fifth Avenue clothing store , and sometimes even now she has a tendency to slouch and walk about long-strided in a loose-limbed , toes-out way , though when she takes a square stance up over a golf ball , she can smack it a mile . In some ways she has become as much of a genuine athlete as anyone I know . Needless to say , I have the greatest admiration for her , and love her in every way but the strictest  | one . Sometimes I see her on the street in town or in her car without expecting to and without her knowing it , and I am struck by wonder : what can she want from life now ? I low could I have ever loved her and let her go . " It 's chilly , still , " she says , in a small , firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands stuffed down deep inside her raincoat . It is a voice I love . In many ways it was her voice I loved first , the sharpened midwestern vowels , the succinct glaciated syntax : Binton Ilerbor , himburg , Gren Repids . It is a voice that knows the minimum of what will suffice , and banks on it . In general I have always liked hearing women talk more than men . I wonder , in fact , what my own voice will sound like . Will it be a convincing , truth-telling voice ? Or a pseudo-sincere , phony , exhusband one that will stir up trouble ? I have a voice that is really mine , a frank , vaguely rural voice more or less like a used car salesman : a no-frills voice that hopes to uncover simple truth by a straighton application of the facts . I used to practice it when I was in college . " Well , okay , look at it this way , " I 'd say right out loud . " All right , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as any , this constitutes my sportswriter voice , though I have stopped practicing by now . X leans herself against the curved marble monument of a man named Craig  --  at a safe distance from me  --  and presses her lips inward . Up to this moment I have not noticed the cold . But now that she said it , I feel it in my bones and wish I 'd worn a sweater . These pre-dawn meetings were my idea , and in the abstract they seem like a good way for two people like us to share a remaining intimacy . In practice they are as uncomfortable as a hanging , and it 's conceivable we will just forgo it next year , though we felt the same way last year . It is simply that I do n't know how to mourn and neither does X. Neither of us has the vocabulary or temperament for it , and so we are more prone to pass the time chatting , which is n't always wise . " Did Paul mention our rendezvous last night ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night I had an unexpected meeting with him standing in the dark street in front of his house , when his mother was inside  | and knew nothing of it , and I was lurking about outside . We had a talk about Ralph , and where he was and about how it might be possible to reach him  --  all of which caused me to go away feeling better . X and I agree in principle that I should n't sneak my visits , but this was not that way . " He told me Daddy was sitting in the car in the dark watching the house like the police . " She stares at me curiously . " It was just an odd day . It ended up fine , though . " It was in fact much more than an odd day . " You could 've come in . You 're always welcome . " I smile a winning smile at her . " Another time I will . " ( Sometimes we do strange things and say they 're accidents and coincidences , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just wondered if something was wrong , " X says . " No . I love him very much . " " Good , " X says and sighs . I have spoken in a voice that pleases me , a voice that is really mine . X brings a sandwich bag out of her pocket , removes a hard-boiled egg and begins to peel it into the bag . We actually have little to say . We talk on the phone at least twice a week , mostly about the children , who visit me after school while X is still out on the teaching tee . Occasionally I bump into her in the grocery line , or take a table next to hers at the August Inn , and we will have a brief chairback chat . We have tried to stay a modern , divided family . Our meeting here is only by way of a memorial for an old life lost . Still it is a good time to talk . Last year , for instance , X told me that if she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married and try to make a go of it on the LPGA tour . Her father had offered to sponsor her , she said , back in 1966 ? something she had never told me before . She did not say if she would marry me when the time came . But she did say she wished I had finished my novel , that it would have probably made things better , which surprised me . ( She later took that back . ) She also told me , without being particularly critical , that she considered me a loner , which  | surprised me too . She said that it was a mistake to have made as few superficial friends as I have done in my life , and to have concentrated only on the few things I have concentrated on  --  her , for one . My children , for another . Sportswriting and being an ordinary citizen . This did not leave me well enough armored for the unexpected , was her opinion . She said this was because I did n't know my parents very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the south , which was full of betrayers and secret-keepers and untrustworthy people , which I agree is true , though I never knew any of them . All that originated , she said , with the outcome of the Civil War . It was much better to have grown up , she said , as she did , in a place with no apparent character , where there is nothing ambiguous around to confuse you or complicate things , where the only thing anybody ever thought seriously about was the weather . " Do you think you laugh enough these days ? " She finishes peeling her egg and puts the sack down deep in her coat pocket . She knows about Vicki , and I 've had one or two other girlfriends since our divorce that I 'm sure the children have told her about . But I do not think she thinks they have turned my basic situation around much . And maybe she 's right . In any case I am happy to have this apparently intimate , truth-telling conversation , something I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good for . " You bet I do , " I say . " I think I 'm doing all right , if that 's what you mean . " " I suppose it is , " X says , looking at her boiled egg as if it posed a small but intriguing problem . " I 'm not really worried about you . " She raises her eyes at me in an appraising way . It 's possible my talk with Paul last night has made her think I 've gone off my bearings or started drinking . " I watch Johnny . He 's good for a laugh , " I say . " I think he gets funnier as I get older . But thanks for asking . " All this makes me feel stupid . I smile at her . X takes a tiny mouse bite out of her white egg . " I apologize for prying into your life . " " It 's fine . "  | X breathes out audibly and speaks softly . " I woke up this morning in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Ralph laughing . It made me cry , in fact . But I thought to myself that you have to strive to live your life to the ultimate . Ralph lived his whole life in nine years , and I remember him laughing . I just wanted to , be sure you did . You have a lot longer to live . " " My birthday 's in two weeks . " " Do you think you 'll get married again ? " X says with extreme formality , looking up at me . And for a moment what I smell in the dense morning air is a swimming pool ! Somewhere nearby . The cool , aqueous suburban chlorine bouquet that reminds me of the summer coming , and all the other better summers of memory . It is a token of the suburbs I love , that from time to time a swimming pool or a barbecue or a leaf fire you 'll never ever see will drift provocatively to your nose . " I guess I do n't know , " I say . Though in truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , not on a bet , not this boy . Except what I do say is nearer to the truth . And just as quick , the silky-summery smell is gone , and the smell of dirt and stolid monuments has won back its proper place . In the quavery gray dawn a window lights up beyond the fence on the third floor of my house . Bosobolo , my African boarder , is awake . His day is beginning and I see his dark shape pass the window . Across the cemetery in the other direction I see yellow lights in the caretaker 's cottage , beside which sits the green John Deere backhoe used for dredging graves . The bells of St. Leo the Great begin to chime a Good Friday prayer call . " Christ Died Today , Christ Died Today " ( though I believe it is actually " Stabat Mater Dolorosa " ) . " I think I 'll get married again , " X says matter-of-factly . Who to , I wonder ? " Who to ? " Not  --  please  --  one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hearty , green-sports-coat types who 're always taking her on weekends to the Trapp Family Lodge and getaways to the Poconos , where they take in new Borscht Belt comedians and make love on waterbeds . I hope against all hope not . I know all about  | those guys . The children tell me . They all drive Oldsmobiles and wear tasseled shoes . And there is every good reason to go out with them , I grant you . Let them spend their money and enjoy their discretionary time . They 're decent fellows , I 'm sure . But they are not to be married . " Oh , a software salesman , maybe , " X says . " A realtor . Somebody I can beat at golf and bully . " She smiles at me a mouth-down smirky smile of unhappiness , and bunches her shoulders to wag them . But unexpectedly she starts to cry through her smile , nodding toward me as if we both knew about it and should 've expected this , and that in a way I am to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I saw X cry was the night our house was broken into , when , in the search for what might 've been stolen , she found some letters I 'd been getting from a woman in Blanding , Kansas . I do n't know why I kept them . They really did n't mean anything to me . I had n't seen the woman in months and then only once . But I was in the thickest depths of my dreaminess then , and needed  --  or thought I did  --  something to anticipate away from my life , even though I had no plans for ever seeing her and was in fact intending to throw the letters away . The burglars had left Polaroid pictures of the inside of our empty house scattered about for us to find when we got back from seeing The Thirty-Nine Steps at the Playhouse , plus the words , " We are the stuffed men , " spray-painted onto the dining room wall . Ralph had been dead two years . The children were with their grandfather at the Huron Mountain Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Berkshire College , and was hanging around the house more or less dumb as a cashew , but otherwise in pretty good spirits . X found the letters in a drawer of my office desk while looking for a sock full of silver dollars my mother had left me , and sat on the floor and read them , then handed them to me when I came in with a list of missing cameras , radios and fishing equipment . She asked if I had anything to say , and when I did n't , she went into the bedroom and began tearing apart her hope chest with a claw hammer and a crowbar . She tore it to bits , then took it to the fireplace and burned it while I stood outside in the yard mooning  | at Cassiopeia and Gemini and feeling invulnerable because of dreaminess and an odd amusement I felt almost everything in my life could be subject to . It might seem that I was " within myself " then . But in fact I was light years away from everything . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house left shining and her hope chest going up the chimney in smoke  --  it was June  --  and sat in a lawn chair in another part of the dark yard from where I was standing and cried loudly . Lurking behind a large rhododendron in the dark , I spoke some hopeful and unconsoling words to her , but I do n't think she heard me . My voice had gotten so soft by then as to be inaudible to anyone but myself . I looked up at the smoke of what I found out was her hope chest , full of all those precious things : menus , ticket stubs , photographs , hotel room receipts , place cards , her wedding veil , and wondered what it was , what in the world it could 've been drifting off into the clear spiritless I New jersey nighttime . It reminded me of the smoke that announced a new Pope  --  a new Pope ! ? if that is believable now , under those circumstances . And in four months I was divorced . All this seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to someone else and I had only read about it . But that was my life then , and it is my life now , and I am in relatively good spirits about it . If there 's another thing that sportswriting teaches you , it is that there are no transcendent themes in life . In all cases things are here and they 're over , and that has to be enough . The other view is a lie of literature and the liberal arts , which is why I did not succeed as a teacher , and another reason I put my novel away in the drawer and have not taken it out . " Yes , of course , " X says and sniffs . She has almost stopped crying , though I have not tried to comfort her ( a privilege I no longer hold ) . She raises her eyes up to the milky sky and sniffs again . She is still holding the nibbled egg . " When I cried in the dark , I thought about what a big nice boy Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-seven no matter what . I wondered about what we should all be doing . " She shakes her head and squeezes her arms tight against her stomach in a way I have not seen her do in a long time . " It 's  | not your fault , Frank . I just thought it would be all right if you saw me cry . That 's my idea of grief . Is n't that womanish ? " She is waiting for me to say a word now , to liberate us from that old misery of memory and life . It 's pretty obvious she feels something is odd today , some freshening in the air to augur a permanent change in things . And I am her boy , happy to do that very thing  --  let my optimism win back a day or at least the morning or a moment when it all seems lost to grief . My one redeeming strength of character may be that I am good when the chips are down . With success I am worse . " Why do n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy old rejected suitor 's smile . " I guess I was supposed to bring it , was n't I ? " X says , wiping her eyes . " I cried instead of bringing a poem . " She has become girlish in her tears . " Well , that 's okay , " I say and go down into my pants pockets for the poem I have Xeroxed at the office and brought along in case X forgot . Last year I brought I Iousman 's " To An Athlete Dying Young " and made the mistake of not reading it over beforehand . I had not read it since I was in college , but the title made me remember it as something that would be good to read . Which it was n't . If anything , it was much too literal and dreamily so about real athletes , a subject I have strong feelings about . Ralph in fact had not been much of an athlete . I barely got past " townsman of a stiller town , " before I had to stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incised with the little words RALPH BASCOMBE . " IHousman hated women , you know , " X had said into the awful silence while I sat . " That 's nothing against you . I just remembered if from some class . I think he was an old pederast who would 've loved Ralph and hated us . Next year I 'll bring a poem if that 's okay . " " Fine , " I had answered miserably . It was after that that she told me about my writing a novel and being a loner , and having wanted to join the LPGA back in the sixties . I think she felt sorry for me ? I 'm sure of it , in fact  --  though I also felt sorry for myself .  | " Did you bring another I lousman poem ? " she says now and smirks at me , then turns and throws her nibbled egg as far as she can off into the gravestones and elms of the old part , where it hits soundlessly . She throws as a catcher would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a tape-line into the shadows . I admire her positive form . To mourn the loss of one child when you have two others is a hard business . And we are not very practiced , though we treat it as a matter of personal dignity and affection so that Ralph 's death and our loss will not get entrapped by time and . events and ruin our lives in a secret way . In a sense , we can do no wrong here . Out on Constitution Street an appliance repair truck has stopped at the light . Easter 's Philco Repair , driven by Sid ( formerly of Sid 's Service , a bankrupt ) . He has worked on my house many times and is heading toward the village square to hav-a-cup at The Coffee Spot before plunging off into the day 's kitchens and basements and sump pumps . The day is starting in earnest .

" No Housman today , " I say . " Well , " X says and smiles , and seats herself on Craig 's stone to listen . " If you say so .

It is a " Meditation " by Theodore Roethke , who also attended the University of Michigan , something X will be wise to , and I start it in my best , most plausible voice , as if my dead son could hear it down below : " I have gone into the waste lonely places behind the eye .... " X has already begun to shake her head before I am to the second line , and I stop and look to her to see where the trouble is.  | She puches out her lower lip and sits her stone .

I feel tension rising off me like a fever now . It is possible that reading a poem over a little boy who never cared about poems is not a good idea . " I thought you 'd know it , " I say in a congenial voice . " I should n't really say I do n't like it , " X says coldly . " I just do n't believe it , is all . " It is a poem about letting the everyday make you happy  --  insects , shadows , the color of a woman 's hair  --  something else I have some strong beliefs about . " When I read it , I always think it 's me talking , " I say . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . They might not make you miserable . But that 's all , " X says and slips down off the stone . She smiles at me in a manner I do not like , tight-lipped and disparaging , as if she believes I 'm wrong about everything and finds it amusing . " Sometimes I do n't think anyone can be happy anymore . " She puts her hands in her London Fog . She probably has a lesson at seven , or a follow-through seminar , and her mind is ready to be far , far away . " I think we 're all released to the rest of our lives , is my way of looking at it , " I say hopefully . " Is n't that true ? " She stares at our son 's grave as if he were listening and would be embarrassed to hear us . " I guess . " " Are you really getting married ?

"  | " Maybe you should get married . Maybe it would make you happy . " I do not believe it for a minute , of course . I 'm ready to marry her again myself , get life back on track . I miss the sweet specificity of marriage , its firm ballast and sail . X misses it too , I can tell . It 's the thing we both feel the lack of . We are having to make everything up now , since nothing is ours by right . She shakes her head . " What did you and Pauly talk about last night ? I felt like it was all men 's secrets and I was n't in on it . I hated " We talked about Ralph . Paul has a theory we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a good talk . " X smiles at the idea of Paul , who is as dreamy in his own way as I ever was . I have never thought X much liked that in him , and preferred Ralph 's certainty since it was more like hers and , as such , admirable . When he was fiercely sick with Reye 's , he sat up in bed in the hospital one day , in a delirium , and said , " Marriage is a damnably serious business , particularly in Boston " ? something he 'd read in Bartlett 's , which he used to leaf through , memorizing and reciting . It took me six weeks to track the remark down to Marquand . And by then he was dead and lying right here . But X liked it , thought it proved his mind was working away well underneath the deep coma . Unfortunately it became a kind of motto for our marriage from then till the end , an unmeant malediction Ralph pronounced on us . " I like your new hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the back that is very becoming . We are past the end of things now , but I do n't want to leave . X fingers a strand , pulls it straight away from her head and cuts her eyes over at it . " It 's dikey , do n't you think ? " " No . " And indeed I do n't . " Well . It 'd gotten to a funny length . I had to do something . They screamed at home when they saw it . " She smiles as if she 's realized this moment that children become our parents , and we just become children again . " You do n't feel old , do you , Frank ? " She turns and stares away across the cemetery . " I do n't know why I 've got all these  | shitty questions . I feel old today . I 'm sure it 's because you 're going to be thirty-nine . " The black man has come to the corner of Constitution Street and stands waiting as the traffic light flicks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliance truck is gone , and a yellow minibus stops and lets black maids out onto the same corner . They are large women in white , tentish maid-dresses , talking and swinging big banger purses , waiting for their white ladies to come and pick them up . The man and women do not speak . " Oh , is n't that the saddest thing you ever saw , " X says , staring at the women . " Something about that breaks my heart . I do n't know why . " " I really do n't feel a hit old , " I say , happy to be able to answer a question honestly , and possibly slip in some good advice on the side . " I have to wash my hair a little more often . And sometimes I wake up and my heart 's pounding to beat the band  --  though Fincher Barksdale says it is n't anything to worry about . I think it 's a good sign .

Since our divorce she has developed the capability of complete distraction . She will be talking to you but be a thousand miles away . " You 're very adaptable , " she says airily . " I am . I know you do n't have a sleeping porch in your house , but you should try sleeping with all your windows open and your clothes on . When you wake up , you 're ready to go . I 've been doing it for a while now . " X smiles at me again with a tight-lipped smile of condescension , a smile I do n't like . We are not Hansel and Gretel anymore . " Do you still see your palmist , what's-her-name ? " " Mrs. Miller . No , less often . " I 'm not about to admit I tried to see her last night . " Do you feel like you 're at the point of understanding everything that 's happened  --  to us and our life ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't seem like it 's going to make me crazy again . "  | " You know , " X says , looking away . " Last night I lay in bed and thought bats were flying around my room , and when I closed my eyes I just saw a horizon line a long way off , with everything empty and flat like a long dinner table set for one . Is n't that awful ? " She shakes her head . " Maybe I should lead a life more like yours . " A small resentment rises in me , though this is not the place for resentment . X 's view of my life is that it is a jollier , more close to the grain business than hers , and certainly more that way than I know it to be . She 'd probably like to tell me again that I should 've gone ahead and written a novel instead of quitting and being a sportswriter , and that she should 've done some things differently herself . But that would not be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times when she thought so herself . Everything looks old gloomy to her now . One strain in her character that our divorce has touched is that she is possibly less resilient than she has been before in her life , and worry about getting older is proof of it . I 'd cheer her up if I could , but that is one of the talents I lost a long time ago ; " I 'm sorry again , " she says . " I 'm just feeling blue today . There 's something about your going away that makes me feel like you 're leaving for a new life and I 'm not . " " I hope I am , " I say , " though I doubt it . I hope you are . " Nothing , in fact , would I like better than to have a whole new colorful world open up to me today , though I like things pretty well as they are . I will settle for a nice room at the Pontchartrain , a steak Diane and a salad bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights . I am not hard to make happy . " Do you ever wish you were younger ? " X says moodily . " No . I 'm fairly happy this way . " " I wish it all the time , " she says . " That seems stupid , I know . " I have nothing I can say to this . " You 're an optimist , Frank . " " I hope I am . " I smile a good yeoman 's smile at her . " Sure , sure , " she says , and turns away from me and begins making her way quickly out through the tombstones , her head up toward  | the white sky , her hands deep in her pockets like any midwestern girl who 's run out of luck for the moment but will soon be back as good as new . I hear the bells of St. Leo the Great chime six o'clock , and for some reason I have a feeling I wo n't see her for a long time , that something is over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of me what those somethings might be .  | All we really want is to get to the point where the past can explain nothing about us and we can get on with life . Whose history can ever reveal very much ? In my view Americans put too much emphasis on their pasts as a way of defining themselves , which can be death-dealing . I know I 'm always heartsick in novels ( sometimes I skip these parts altogether ; sometimes I close the book and never pick it up again ) when the novelist makes his clanking , obligatory trip into the Davy Jones locker of the past . Most pasts , let 's face it , are n't very dramatic subjects , and should be just uninteresting enough to release you the instant you 're ready ( though it 's true that when we get to that moment we are often scared to death , feel naked as snakes and have nothing to say ) . My own history I think of as a postcard with changing scenes on one side but no particular or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your beginnings , as we all know , and not by any malevolent designs , just by life itself , fate , the tug of the everpresent . The stamp of our parents on us and of the past in general is , to my mind , overworked , since at some point we are whole and by ourselves upon the earth , and there is nothing that can change that for better or worse , and so we might as well think about something more promising . I was born into an ordinary , modern existence in 1945 , an only child to decent parents of no irregular point of view , no particular sense of their place in history 's continuum , just two people afloat on the world and expectant like most others in time , without a daunting conviction about their own consequence . This seems like a fine lineage to me still . My parents were rural Iowans who left farms near the town of Keota and moved around a lot as young marrieds , settling finally in  | Biloxi , Mississippi , where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Ingalls ship-building company , for the Navy , which he 'd served in during the war . " The year before that they had been in Cicero , doing what I 'm not really sure . The year before that in El Reno , Oklahoma , and before that near Davenport , where my father had something to do with the railroad . I 'm frankly hazy about his work , though I have enough memory of him : a tall rangy blade-faced man with pale eyes  --  like me  --  but with romantically curly hair . I have tried to place him in a Davenport or a Cicero , where I 've gone myself to report sports events . But the effect is strange . He was not a man  --  at least in my memory  --  for those places . I remember my father played golf and sometimes I went with him around the flat course on hot days in the Biloxi summer . He played on the Air Force Base links which were tanned and bleached out and frequented by non-coms . This was so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies or get her hair fixed or stay home reading movie magazines and cheap novels . Golf seemed to me then the saddest kind of torture , and even my poor father did n't seem to have much fun at it . He was not really the golf type , but more the type to race cars , and he took it up , I believe , in a mindful way because it meant something to him , some measure of success in the world . I remember standing on a tee with him , both of us wearing shorts , looking down the long palm-lined fairway beyond which you could see a sea wall and the Gulf , and seeing him grimace toward the far-away flag as if it represented a fortress he was reluctantly about to lay seige to , and him saying to me , " Well , Franky , do you think I can hit it that far ? " And my saying , " I doubt it . " He was sweating and smoking a cigarette in the heat , and I have a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wonder . Who was I again ? What was it I was planning ? He seemed struck by such questions . It was not exactly a heartless look , just a look of profoundest wonder and resign . My father died when I was fourteen , and after that my mother placed me in what she called " the naval academy , " which was in  | fact a little military school near Gulfport called Gulf Pines ( we cadets called it Lonesome Pines ) and where I never once minded being . In fact , I liked the military bearing that was required there , and I think there is an upright part of my character which at least respects the appearance of rectitude if not the fact , and which school was responsible for . My situation at Lonesome Pines was somewhat more than average , since most of the cadets had come there from the broken homes of rich people or from abandonment , or because they had stolen something or burned something down and their families were able to get them off and sent there instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any different from me , just boys full of secrecy and not-knowing and abject longing , who thought of this time as something simply to be gotten through , so that no one made attachments . It was as if we all sensed we 'd be gone someday soon in a sudden instant  --  often it happened in the middle of the night  --  and did n't want to get involved . Or else it was that none of us wanted to know anybody later on who was the way we were now . What I remember of the place was a hot parade grounds surrounded by sparse pine trees , a flag pole with an anchor at its base , a stale shallow lake where I learned to sail , a smelly beach and boat house , hot brown stucco classroom buildings and white barracks houses that reeked with mops . There were some ex-Navy warrant officers who taught there  --  men unsuited for regular teaching . One Negro even taught there , a man named Bud Simmons who coached baseball . The Commandant was an old captain from World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves in bunches , out on Highway 1 in the little Gulf Coast towns we could get to by public bus , in the airconditioned movie and tamale houses , or hanging out in the vicinity of Keesler Air Force Base , in the hot , sandy parking lots of strip joints , all of us in our brown uniforms trying to get the real servicemen to buy us booze , and wretched because we were too young to go in ourselves and had too little money to be able to do anything but squander it .  | I went home on holidays to my mother 's bungalow in Biloxi , and occasionally I saw her brother Ted who lived not far away , and who came to see me and took me on trips to Mobile and Pensacola , where we did not do much talking . It may he just the fate of boys whose fathers die young never to be young  --  officially  --  ourselves ; youth being just a brief dream , a prelude of no particular lasting moment before actual life begins . My only personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play baseball on the school team , under Bud Simmons , the Negro coach . I was relatively tall for my age  --  though I 'm more normal now  --  and I had the lanky , long-loose-arm grace of a natural ball player . But I could never do it well . I could always see myself as though from outside , doing the things I was told to do . And that was enough never to do them well or fully . An inbred irony seemed to haunt me , and served no useful purpose but to make me a musing , wiseacre kid , shifty-eyed and secretive  --  the kind who belongs in exactly such a place as Lonesome Pines . Bud Simmons did what he could with me , including make me throw with my other arm , which I happily did , though it did n't help at all . He referred to my problem as not being able to " give it up , " and I knew exactly what he meant . ( Today I am amazed when I find athletes who can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sport . That does not happen often , and it is a dear gift from a complex God. ) id not see so much of my mother in those years . Nor does this eem ceptional to me . It must 've happened to thousands of us . 194 s , and to children in earlier centuries as well . It seems odder tha ildren see their parents so much these days , and come to know them better than they probably ever need to . I saw my mother when she could see me . I stayed in her house when I was back from school and we acted like friends . She loved me as much as she was able to , given her altered situation . She might 've liked having a closer life with me . I 'm sure I would 've liked it . But it 's possible she was dreamy herself and in no particular mind to know exactly what to do . I 'm sure she never thought my father would die , in the same way I did n't think Ralph would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-four , a small dark-eyed woman with skin darker than mine , and who strikes me now as having been shocked by how far she had come from where she was born , and having been more absorbed by that than anything . Her life just distracted her the way another person would , not in a hateful or a selfish way , possibly even the way my father had , but that I knew nothing about . I think she must 've been worried about going hack to Iowa , and did n't want to . I Eventually she went to work in a large hotel called the Buena Vista in Mississippi City as the night cashier , and while she was there she met a man named Jake Ornstein , a jeweler from Chicago , and after a few months in which he made several trips down , she married him and moved to Skokie , Illinois , where she lived until she got cancer and died . At almost that same time I won an NROTC scholarship through II Lonesome Pines , and by pure chance enrolled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a mix , and nobody got to go where they wanted to go , though I do n't even remember where I wanted to go , except it probably was n't there . I do remember that there were times when I visited my mother in Skokie , taking the fragrant old New York Central from Ann Arbor and spending the weekend lounging around trying to be comfortable and make conversation in that strangely suburban ranch-style house with plastic slipcovers on the furniture and twenty-five clocks on the walls , in a Jewish neighborhood and in a town where I had no attachments . Jake Ornstein was fifteen years older than my mother and was quite a nice fellow , and I got along well with him and his son Irv  --  better , in fact , than I ended up getting along with my mother . She mentioned she thought my college was " one of the good schools , " but treated me like a nephew she did n't know very well , and who worried her , even though she liked me . ( She gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school  --  she was already in Skokie by then so that my leaving was from there . ) For my part I 'm sure I stared a lot and kept a distance . I 'm sure we both tried to approach one another on some new level that could 've flattered us both when we saw how we 'd adjusted . But her life had gotten in  | front of her somehow , and I became someone out of another time , a fact I do n't hold against my mother and have n't felt abandoned or disaffected because of it . What could her life have been like , after all ? Good , bad , both by turns ? A long pathway through which she hoped to be not too unhappy ? She knew . But only she knew . And I am not prone to judge a life I do n't know much about , in particular since things have turned out all right for me . The best I knew then , and still , is of my own life , which at the time my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on with . I know that she and Jake were happy , and that I loved my mother very much in whatever way I was able , knowing so little about her . When she died 1 was still in school . I went to the funeral , acted as a pallbearer , sat around Jake 's house for a weekend afternoon with the people they both knew , tried to think of what my parents had taught me in their lives ( I came up with " a sense of independence " ) . And that night I got back on the train and slipped out of that life for good . Jake , afterwards , moved to Phoenix , married again , and died of cancer himself . Iry and I kept in touch for a few years , but have drifted apart . But does that seem like an odd life ? Does it seem strange that I do not have a long and storied family history ? Or a list of problems and hatreds to brood about  --  a bill of particular grievances and nostalgias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born into a different time . But maybe my way is better all around , and is actually the way with most of us and the rest tell lies . Still . Do I ever wonder what my family would think of me ? Of my profession ? As a divorced man , a father , a quester after women ? As an adult heading for life and death ? Sometimes . Though it never stays with me long . And , indeed , when I think of it , I think this : that they would probably have approved of everything I 've done  --  particularly my decision to quit writing and get on to something they would think of as more practical . ' Ihey would feel about it the way I do : that things sometimes happen for the best . Thinking that way has given me a chance for an interesting if not particularly simple adulthood .  | By 9:30 I have nearly finished the few odds-and-ends details remaining before picking up Vicki and heading for the airport . Usually this would include a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , a custom I enjoy , but not today . We have had some good give-and-takes on such subjects as whether the bliss of the redeemed is heightened by the sufferings of the damned ? something he feels Catholic about , but I do n't . He is forty-two and from the country of Gabon , and a stern-faced apologist for limitless faith . I usually argue for works , but without any illusions about where it 'll get me . Why take a boarder ? To ward off awful loneliness . Why else ? The consolation in the disinterested footfalls of another human in an otherwise empty house , especially a six-foot-five-inch Negro from Africa living in your attic , can be considerable . This morning , though , he is away early on his own business and I see him from the window larruping up Hoving Road like a Bible salesman , heading for school ? white shirt , black trousers and truck-tread sandals .

We 're both Presbyterians , though I am not a good one . My other duties require the usual phone calls from my desk : first to the magazine , for business with Rhonda Matuzak , my editor , who has dug into the rumors that all is not roses on the Detroit team , which could be a problem . The general feeling at the editors ' meeting is I should do the story and take what I get . Sports thrives on this kind of turmoil and patented misinformation , though I am not much interested in it . Rhonda is divorced and lives alone with two cats in a large darkwalled , high-ceilinged floor-thru in the West Eighties , and is always trying to get me to meet her at Victor 's for dinner , or to haul off to some evening 's activity after work . Though except for one painful night after my divorce I 've always managed just to have a drink at Grand Central , put her in a cab , then hurry off to Penn Station and home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her late thirties with an old-fashioned , chorus-line figure , but with a face like a racehorse and a loud voice I do n't like . ( Illusion would be well-nigh impossible even with the lights off . ) For a time after my divorce everything began to seem profoundly ironic to me . I found myself thinking of other peoples ' worries as sources of amusement and private derision which I thought about at night to make myself feel better . Rhonda helped me out of all that by continuing to invite me to dinner and leaving notes on my desk which said " all loss is relative , jack , " " nobody ever died of a broken heart , " and " only the young die good . " On the one night I agreed to have dinner with her  --  at Mallory 's on West 70th Street  --  we ended up in her apartment sitting in facing Bauhaus chairs , with me unhappily coming down with a case of the dreads so thick they seemed to whistle out the heating ducts and swarm the room like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street for air , I said , and she was considerate enough to believe I was still having trouble getting adjusted to being single again , and not that I was for some reason scared out of my wits to be alone with her . She walked me downstairs and out into the dark and windy canyons of West End Avenue , where we stood at the curb and talked about her favorite subject , American furniture history , and after a while I thanked her , clambered into a cab like a refugee and beat it down to 33rd Street and my safe train to New Jersey . What I did n't tell Rhonda and what is still true , is that I can not stand being alone in New York after dark . Gotham takes on a flashing nighttime character I just ca n't bear . The lights of bars demoralize me , the showy glow of taxi cabs whiz-banging down Fifth Avenue or careening out of the Park Avenue tunnel make me somehow heartsick and turmoiled and endangered . I feel adrift and badly so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in their silly garb , headed for assignations , idiot softball games or cocktails on the cuff . I ca n't bear all the complications , and long for something that is facades-only and non-literate  --  the cozy pseudocolonial Square here in conventional Haddam ; the nicotine clouds  | of New Jersey as seen from a high office building like mine at dusk ; the poignancy of a nighttime train ride back down the long line home . It was had enough that one night to have Rhonda " walk me " down West End three blocks to a good cross street , but it was worse afterwards to ride in that bouncing , clanging cab clear to the station and then to dart  --  my feet feeling frozen  --  in and down the escalator from Seventh before the whole city reached out and clutched me like the pale hand of a dead limo driver . " Why stay out there like a hermit , Bascombe ? " Rhonda is louder than usual on the phone this morning . As an equalizer she refers to men by our last names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could never yearn for anyone who called me Bascombe . " A lot of people are where they belong , Rhonda . I 'm one of them . " " You 're talented , God knows . " She taps something hard near the phone with a pencil eraser . " I 've read those short stories , you know . They 're very , very good . " " Thanks for saying so . " " Did you ever think about writing another book ? " " No . " " You should . You should move up here . At least stay in sometime . You 'd see . " " What would I see ? " " You 'd see it 's not so bad . " " I 'd rather have something wonderful , not just not so bad , Rhonda . I 've pretty much got it right here . " " In New Jersey . " " I like it here .

Try to get some insider stuff on the NFL draft . Okay ? They 're putting together the Pigskin Preview Sunday night . You can call it in . " " Thanks , Rhonda . I 'll do my best . " " Frank ? What 're you searching for ? " " Nothing , " I say . I hang up before she has a chance to think of something else . I make my other calls snappy  --  one is to an athletic shoe designer in Denver for a " Sports Chek " round-up box I 'm pulling together on foot injuries , and which other people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are twenty-six bones in the foot , and only two people in eight will ever know their correct shoe size . Of those two , one will still suffer permanent foot injury before he or she is sixtytwo  --  due to product defect . Women , I learn , are 38 percent more susceptible than men , although men have a higher percentage of painful injuries due to body weight , stress and other athletic-related activities . Men complain less , however , and consequently amount to a hidden statistic . Another call is to a Carmelite nun in Fayetteville , West Virginia , who is trying to run in the Boston Marathon . Once a polio victim , she is facing an uphill credentials fight in her quest to compete , and I 'm glad to put a plug in for her in our " Achievers " column . I make a follow-up call to the public relations people at the Detroit Football Club to see if they have someone they 'd like to speak on behalf of the organization about Herb Wallagher , the ex-lineman , but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walled Lake , to let him know I 'm on my way . The research department has already done a workup on Herb , and I have a thick pile of his press clips , photographs , as well as transcribed interviews with his parents in Beaver Falls , his college coach at Allegheny , his surgeon , and the girl who was  | driving the ski boat when Herb was injured and whose life , I 've learned , has been changed forever . On the phone Herb is a friendly , ruminative fellow with a Beaver Falls way of swallowing his consonants  --  wunt for would n't , shunt for should n't . I 've got before-andafter pictures of him in his playing days and today , and in them he 1 1 , does not look like the same person . Then he looks like a grinning tractor-trailer in a plastic helmet . Now he wears black horn-rims , and having lost weight and hair , looks like an overworked insurance agent . Linemen often tend to be more within themselves than most athletes , particularly once they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decided to c go to law school next fall , and that his wife Clarice has signed on for the whole trip . He tells me he does n't see why anybody shunt get all the education they can get , and that you 're never too old to learn , and I agree wholeheartedly , though I detect in Herb 's voice a nervy formality I ca n't quite make out , as if something was bothering him but he did n't want to make a fuss about it now . It could easily be the team troubles I 've been hearing about . But more than likely this is just the way with all wheelchair victims : after you lift weights , eat a good breakfast , use the toilet , read the paper and bathe , what 's left for the day but news broadcasts , reticence and turning inward ? A good sense of decorum can make life bearable when otherwise you might be tempted to blow your brains out . " Listen , I 'll sure be glad to see you , Frank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked on the phone only once , but I feel like I know him already . " It 'll be good to see you , Herb . " " You miss a lot of things now , you know , " Herb says . " Television 's great . But it 's not enough . " " We 'll have a good talk , Herb . ' " We 'll have a time , wo n't we ? I know we will . " " I 'll say we will . See you tomorrow . " " You take care , Frank . Safe trip and all that . " " Thanks , Herb . " " Think metric , Frank . Hah . " Herb hangs up .  | atever 's left to tell of my past can be dispensed with in a New York minute . At Michigan I studied the liberal arts in the College of Literature , Science and the Arts ( along with ROTC ) . I took all the courses I was supposed to , including Latin , spent some time at the Daily writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet up in the Sigma Chi house , where one crisp autumn day in 1965 , I met X , who was the term party date of a brother of mine named Laddy Nozar , from Benton Harbor , and who  --  X ? impressed me as ungainly and too earnest and not a girl I would ever care to go out with . She was very athletic-looking , with what seemed like too large breasts , and had a way of standing with her arms crossed and one leg in front of the other and slightly turned out that let you know she was probably sizing you up for fun . She seemed like a rich girl , and I did n't like rich Michigan girls , I did n't think . Consequently I never saw her again until that dismal book signing in New York in 1969 , not long before I married her . Shortly after our first meeting  --  but not because of it  --  I quit school and joined the Marines . This was in the middle stages of the war , and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the NROTC did n't mind . In fact , I joined with Laddy Nozar and two other boys , at the old post office on Main Street in Ann Arbor and had to cross an embarrassing protest line to do it . Laddy Nozar went to Vietnam and got killed at Con Thien with the Third Marines . The two others finished their tours and now run an ad agency in Aurora , Illinois . As it happened , I contracted a pancreatic syndrome which the doctors thought was Hodgkin 's disease but which turned out to be benign , and after two months in Camp Lejeune I was discharged without killing anyone or being killed , but designated a veteran anyway and given benefits . This event happened when 1 was twenty-one years old , and I report it only because it was the first time I remember feeling dreamy in my life , though then what I felt was not so pleasant and I think I would 've said I felt sullen more than anything . I used to lie in bed in the Navy hospital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while I felt interested in . I 'd think about it the  | way you 'd think of a strategy in a ball game , deciding one way then deciding another , seeing myself dead then alive then dead again , as if considerations and options were involved . Then I 'd realize I did n't have any choices and that it was n't going to be that way , and I felt nostalgic for a while , but then got sullen as hell so that the doctors ended up giving me antidepressants to stop my thinking about it altogether , which I did . ( This happens to a lot of people who get sick at a young age , and , in fact , can ruin your life . ) What it did for me , though , was let me go back to college , since I had only missed a semester , and , by 1967 , entertain the idea I 'd been entertaining since reading the seafaring diaries of Joshua Slocum at Lonesome Pines  --  to write a novel . Mine was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets discharged with a mysterious disease , goes to New Orleans and loses himself into a hazy world of sex and drugs and rumored gun-running and a futile attempt to reconcile a vertiginous present with the guilty memories of not dying alongside his Navy comrades , all of which is climaxed in a violent tryst with a Methodist minister 's wife who seduces him in an abandoned slave-quarters , though other times too , after which his life is shattered and he disappears permanently into the Texas oil fields . It was all told in a series of flashbacks . This novel was called Night Wing , the title of a sentimental nautical painting that hung above the sweetheart couch in the Sigma Chi chapter room ( I used a quotation from Marvell up front ) . In the middle of my senior year I wrapped it up and sent it off to a publisher in New York who wrote back in six months to say it " showed promise , " and could he see " other things . " The manuscript got lost in the mail back and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a copy . Though I can remember the opening lines as clearly as if I had written them this morning . They described the night the narrator of the story was conceived . " It was 1944 , and it was April . Dogwoods bloomed in Memphis . The Japanese had not given in and the war plowed on . His father came home from work tired and had a drink , not thinking of the white-coated men with code names , imagining at that moment an atomic bomb ....  | After graduation I bought a car and drove straight out to Manhattan Beach , California , where I rented a room and for four weeks walked in the sand , stared at the women and the oil derricks , but could not see much there that was worth writing about  --  which I 'd decided was what I was going to do . I was getting disability money from the Navy by then , which was supposedly going to pay a tuition , and I managed to have the checks cashed by a woman I met who worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who sent them to me where I went , to the village of San Miguel Tehuantepec in Mexico , to write stories like a real writer . Inside six months of arriving , all in a rush , I wrote twelve stories ? one of which was a reduced form of Night Wing . Without sending one to a magazine , I shipped the whole book to the publisher I 'd been in touch with the year before , who wrote back inside of four weeks to say that his company might publish the book with a number of changes I was only too happy to make , and sent back immediately . He encouraged me to keep writing , which I did , though without much enthusiasm . I had written all I was going to write , if the truth had been known , and there is nothing wrong with that . If more writers knew that , the world would be saved a lot of bad books , and more people  --  men and women alike  --  could go on to happier , more productive lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blue Autumn , was officially accepted while I was on the road driving up from San Miguel Tehuantepec . ( They wired me a check for $700 . ) I stopped off that evening and took in a Little League game under the lights in the town of Grants , New Mexico , and drank a bottle of Cold Duck sitting alone in the stands to toast myself and my fortunes . Almost the next day a movie producer offered to buy the book for a good price , and by the time I got to New York  --  which my editor suggested was a good place to live  --  I was rich , at least for those times . It was 1968 . Right away I rented a railroad apartment on Perry Street in Greenwich Village and tried to set up some kind of writer 's life , a life I actually liked . My book was published in the spring ; I gave readings  | at some small local colleges , interviews on the radio , went out with a lot of girls , acquired a literary agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first trip to the Huron Mountain Club and to the cushy golf clubs her father had memberships in . I found out she was not ungainly or too earnest at all , but was actually a wonderful , unusual , challenging girl ( she was still modeling and making plenty of money ) . We got married in February of 1970 , and I began doing some magazine assignments to deflect the agony of writing my novel , which was entitled Tangier , and took place in Tangier  --  where I had never been , but assumed was like Mexico . The first line of Tangier was , " Autumn came later that year to the rif of the Low Atlas , and Carson was having an embarrassing time staying publicly sober . " It was about a Marine who had deserted the war and wandered across the edges of continents in search of his sense of history , and was told in the first person and also mostly in flashbacks . It sits in my drawer in a closet under a lot of old life-insurance forms and catalogs to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in some book stores because a New York reviewer had said , " Mr. Bascombe is a writer who could turn out to be interesting . " The movie producer decided he could " see a movie " in my stories , and paid me the rest of the money he owed me ( though one was never made ) . I began churning out more work on Tangier , which everybody including me thought I should write . Ralph began to be on the way . X and I were having a fine time going to ball games at Yankee Stadium , driving to Montauk , taking in movies and plays . And suddenly one morning I woke up , stood at the window from which I could see a slice of the Hudson , and recognized that 1 had to get out of New York immediately . from . I had my picture in Newsweek , stayed up late almost every night drinking and carousing with the new friends I was making , wrote very little ( though I stayed at my desk a lot ) , met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advance from my publisher to write a novel I claimed to have an idea for , but had no interest in at all , nor any idea in the world what I could write about . In the fall of 1969 , X and I began to spend a great deal of time  | When I think about it now , I 'm not sure why we did n't just move into a larger apartment . If you were to ask X she would tell you it was n't her idea . Yet something in me just suddenly longed for it . I felt at the time that going into things with a sense of certainty and confidence was everything . And that morning I woke up with the feeling my passport to New York had been invalidated and I had insurmountable wisdom as to the ways of the world ; a feeling that we had to get out of town pronto so that my work could flourish in a place where I knew no one and no one knew me and I could perfect my important writer 's anonymity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lime Rock , Connecticut , up the Housatonic , where we had taken drives . But I could n't have been more fearful of that indecisive Judas country . Its minor mountains and sad Shetland-sweater , Volvo-wagon enclaves spoke to me only of despair and deceit , sarcasm and overweening informalities ? no real place for a real writer ; only for second-rate editors and agents of textbook writers , was my judgment . For lack of a better idea I cast my vote for New Jersey : a plain , unprepossessing and unexpectant landscape , I thought , and correctly . And for Haddam with its hilly and shady seminary niceness ( I 'd seen an ad in the Times , making it sound like an undiscovered Woodstock , Vermont ) , where I could invest my movie money in a sound house ( I was n't wrong ) , and where there was a mix of people ( there was ) , and where a fellow might sit down with good hope and do a serious piece of work himself ( I was n't right there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was worth a hard stand about Connecticut , and in the fall of 1970 we bought the house I now live alone in . X had quit her job to get ready for Ralph . I moved with renewed enthusiasm up to an " office " on the third floor  --  the part I now rent to Mr. Bosobolo  --  and set about trying to invent some more serious writing habits and a good attitude toward my novel , which I 'd let drift over the summer . In a few months we fell in with a younger group of people ( some of whom were writers and editors ) , began attending rounds of cocktail parties , took walks along the nearby  | Delaware , went to literary events in Gotham , attended plays in Bucks County , took drives in the country , stayed home evenings to read , were looked upon as a couple who were a little exceptional ( I was just twenty-five ) , and generally felt fine about our lives and the choices we had made . I gave a talk entitled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Rotarians in a neighboring town ; wrote a piece in a local magazine about " Why I Live Where I Live , " in which I talked about the need to find a place to work that is in most ways " neutral . " I worked on an original screenplay for the producer who 'd bought my book , and wrote several large magazine pieces  --  one about a famous center fielder from the old Sally League , who later became a petroleum baron and spent some time in prison for bank fraud , had several wives , but as a parolee went back to his arid West Texas home of Pumpville and built a therapeutic swimming pool for brain-damaged children and even brought Mexicans up for treatment . A year somehow managed to go by . Then I simply stopped writing . I did n't exactly know I 'd stopped writing . For a good while I 'd gone to my office every day at eight , come downstairs at lunch and lounged around the house reading research books about Morocco , " doping out a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character histories . But the fact was , I was washed up . Sometimes I would go upstairs , sit down , and not have any idea of what I was there for , or what it was I meant to write about , and had simply forgotten everything . My mind would wander to sailing on Lake Superior ( something I had never done ) , and after that I would go back downstairs and take a nap . And as if I needed proof I was washed up , when the managing editor at the magazine I now work for called me and asked if I had any interest in going to work writing sports full-time  --  his magazine , he said , had a nose for good writing of the type he 'd seen in my article about the Texas **28;709;TOOLONG  --  I was more than interested . He said he 'd seen something complex yet hard-nosed in that piece of writing , in particular the way I did n't try to make the old center fielder either a villain or a hero to the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right temperament and eye for detail to do their kind of work , though he said I might just as well think the entire call was a joke . I took the train up the very next morning and had a long talk with the man who had called me , a fat , blue-eyed Chicagoan named Art Fox , and his young assistants , in the old oak-chaired offices the magazine then occupied on Madison and 45th . Art Fox told me that if you 're a man in this country you probably already know enough to be a good sportswriter . More than anything , he said , what you needed was a willingness to watch something very similar over and over again , then be able to write about it in two days ' time , plus an appreciation of the fact that you 're always writing about people who wanted to be doing what they 're doing or they would n't be doing it , which was the only urgency sportswriting could summon , but also the key to overcoming the irrelevancy of sports itself . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of old-fashioned cubicles which still had typewriters and wooden desks , and introduced me around . I shook everyone 's hand and heard them out about what was on their minds ( no one mentioned anything about my book of stories ) , and at three o'clock I went home in brimming spirits . That night I took X out to a high-priced dinner with champagne at the Golden Pheasant , hauled her off on a romantic moonlight walk up the towpath in a direction we 'd never gone , told her all about what I had in mind , what I thought we could practically hope to get from this kind of commitment ( I thought plenty ) , and she simply said she thought it all sounded just fine . I remember that moment , in fact , as one of the happiest of my life . The rest is history , as they say , until my son Ralph got Reye 's syndrome some years later and died , and I launched off into the dreaminess his death may or may not have even caused but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after seeing The Thirty-Nine Steps one night , causing her to send her hope chest chuffing up the chimney stack . Though as I began by saying , I 'm not sure what any of this proves . We all have histories of one kind or another . Some of us have careers that do fine or that do lousy . Something got us to where we are ,  | and nobody 's history could 've brought another Tom , Dick or Harry to the same place . And to me that fact limits the final usefulness of these stories . To the extent that it 's incompletely understood or undisclosed , or just plain fabricated , I suppose it 's true that history can make mystery . And I am always vitally interested in life 's mysteries , which are never in too great a supply , and which I should say are something very different from the dreaminess I just mentioned . Dreaminess is , among other things , a state of suspended recognition , and a response to too much useless and complicated factuality . Its symptoms can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained soaring feeling , or a bout of the stares that you sometimes can not even know about except in retrospect , when the time may seem fogged . When you are young and you suffer it , it is not so bad and in some ways it 's normal and even pleasurable . But when you get to my age , dreaminess is not so pleasurable , at least as a steady diet , and one should avoid it if you 're lucky enough to know it exists , which many people are n't . For a time  --  this was a period after Ralph died  --  I had no idea about it myself , and in fact thought I was onto something big  --  changing my life , moorings loosed , women , travel , marching to a different drummer . Though I was wrong . Which leaves a question which might in fact be interesting . Why did I quit writing ? Forgetting for the moment that I quit writing to become a sportswriter , which is more like being a businessman , or an old-fashioned traveling salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuine writer , since in so many ways words are just our currency , our medium of exchange with our readers , and there is very little that is ever genuinely creative to it at all  --  even if you 're not much more than a fly-swat reporter , as I 'm not . Real writing , after all , is something much more complicated and enigmatic than anything usually having to do with sports , though that 's not to say a word against sportswriting , which I 'd rather do than anything . Was it just that things did not come easily enough ? Or that I could n't translate my personal recognitions into the ambiguous stuff  | of complex literature ? Or that I had nothing to write about , no more discoveries up my sleeve or the pizzaz to write the more extensive work ? And my answer is : there are those reasons and at least twenty better ones . ( Some people only have one book in them . There are worse things . ) One thing certain is that I had somehow lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet pain to know whatever 's next  --  a must for any real writer . And I had no more interest in what I might write next  --  the next sentence , the next day  --  than I cared what a rock weighed on Mars . Nor did I think that writing a novel could make me interested again . Though I minded like all get out the loss of anticipation . And the glossy sports magazine promised me that there would always be something to look forward to , every two weeks . They 'd sec to it . And it would n't be something too hard to handle in words ( my first " beat " was swimming , and some of the older writers put me through a pretty vigorous crash apprenticeship , which always happens ) . I had no special store of sports knowledge , but that was n't needed . I was as comfortable as an old towel in a locker room , had plenty of opinions and had always admired athletes anyway . The goodspirited , manly presence of naked whites and Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never out of place asking a few easy-to-answer questions and being somewhat less imposing than everybody around . Plus , I 'd be paid . Well paid  --  and there 'd be travel . I would regularly see " Frank Bascombe " in print above a piece of workmanlike journalism many people would read and possibly enjoy . Occasionally I 'd get to be some fellow 's guest on a call-in show ( a hook-up in my own living room ) and answer questions from fans in St. Louis or Omaha , where one of my articles had stirred up a bees ' nest of controversy . " This is Eddie from Laclede , Mr. Bascombe , whaddaya think 's wrong with the whole concept of competition on the college level these days ? I think it stinks , Mr. Bascombe , if you want to know what I think . " " Well , Eddie , that 's a pretty good ques-  | tion . . . . " Beyond all that I could look forward to the occasional company of good-natured men who , at least on a superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often have in the real writer 's business . What I determined to do was write well everything they told me to write  --  mixed pairs body-building , sky-diving , the luge , Nebraska 8-man football  --  I could 've written three different stories for every assignment . I thought of things in the middle of the night , jumped out of bed , practically ran down to the study and wrote them . Raw material I had up to then  --  ruminations , fragments of memory , impulses I might 've tried to struggle into a short story suddenly seemed like life I already understood clearly and could write about : fighting the battle with age ; discovering how to think of the future in realistic terms . It must happen to thousands of people that a late calling is missed , with everything afterwards done halfway  --  a sense of accomplishment stillborn . But for me it was the reverse . Without knowing I had a natural calling I had hit on a perfect one : to sit in the empty stands of a Florida ball park and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches and equipment managers in the gusty autumn winds of Wyoming ; stand in the grass of a try-out camp in a mid-size Illinois grain town and watch footballs sail through the air ; to bone up on the relevant stats , then go home or back to the office , sit down at my desk and write about it . What could be better , I thought , and still think ? How more easily assuage the life-long ache to anticipate than to write sports  --  an ache only zen masters and coma victims can live happily without ? I have talked this very subject over with Bert Brisker , who was also once a sportswriter for the magazine , but who has since become a book reviewer for one of the slick weeklies , and he has a remarkably similar set of experiences . Bert is as big as a den bear but gentle as they come now that he 's stopped " rinking . He is the closest acquaintance I still have in town from the old cocktail-dinner party days , and we are always trying to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one occasion I did , Bert got jittery as a  | quail halfway through the evening ( this was about at the point it became clear we had nothing to talk about ) , and ended up downing several vodkas and threatening to throw me through the wall . Consequently we see each other only on the train to Gotham , something that happens once a week . It is , I think , the essence of a modern friendship . Bert was once a poet and has two or three delicate , spindly-thin books I occasionally sec in used bookstore racks . For years , he had a wild-man 's reputation for getting drunk at public readings and telling audiences of nuns and clubwomen to go straight to hell , then falling off stages into deep trance-like sleeps and getting into fistfights in the homes of professors who had invited him there and thought he was an artist . Eventually , of course , he ended up in a rehab hospital in Minnesota and , later , running a poetry program in a small New Hampshire college  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting fired for shacking up with most of his female students , several of whom he moved right into the house with his wife . It is not an unusual story , though that was all years ago . He came to sportswriting precisely as I did , and now lives nearby on a farm in the hills outside of I laddam with his second wife , Penny , and their two daughters , and raises sheepdogs in addition to writing about books . Bert 's specialty , when he was a sportswriter , was ice hockey , and I will commend him by saying he was very good at making an uninteresting game played by Canadians seem sometimes more than uninteresting . Many of our writers are former college teachers or once-aspiring writers who simply could n't take it , or rougher-cut graduates of Ivy League schools who did n't want to be stockbrokers or divorce lawyers . The day of the old bulldog reporter up from the Des Moines Register or the Fargo Dakotan  --  your Al Bucks and your Granny Rices  --  are long gone , though that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bert and I have talked about this subject on our train rides through the New Jersey beltland  --  why he quit writing , why I did . And we 've agreed , to an extent , that we both got gloomy in an attempt to be serious , and that we did n't understand the vital necessity of  | the play of light and dark in literature . I thought my stories were good at the time ( even today I think I might like them ) . They seemed to have a feeling for the human dilemma and they did seem hardnosed and old-eyed about things . It was also true , though , that there were a good many descriptions of the weather and the moon , and that most of them were set in places like remote hunting camps on Canadian Lakes , or in the suburbs , or Arizona or Vermont , places I had never been , and many of them ended with men staring out snowy windows in New England boarding schools or with somebody driving fast down a dark dirt road , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never really love his wife , and bring1 ing on hard emptinesses . They also seemed to depend on silence a lot . I seemed , I felt later , to have been stuck in bad stereotypes . All my men were too serious , too brooding and humorless , characters at loggerheads with imponderable dilemmas , and much less interesting than my female characters , who were always of secondary importance but free-spirited and sharp-witted . For Bert , being serious meant he ended up writing poems about stones and savaged birds ' nests , and empty houses where imaginary brothers he believed were himself had died grisly ritual deaths , until finally , in fact , he could no longer write a line , and substituted getting drunk as a donkey , shacking up with his students and convincing them how important poetry was by boinking the daylights out of them in its name . I le has described this to me as a failure to remain " intellectually pliant . " But we were both stuck like kids who had reached the end of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know how people felt about most things  --  and did n't know what else to do or where to look . And needless to say that is the very place where the great writers  --  your Tolstoys and your George Eliots  --  soar off to become great . But because I did n't soar off to become great  --  and neither did Bert  --  I have to conclude we suffered a failure of imagination right there in the most obvious way . We lost our authority , if that is a clear way of putting it . What I did , as I began writing Tangier , which I hoped would have  | some autobiographical parts set in a military school , was become more and more grave  --  over my literary voice , my sentences and their construction ( they became like some heavy metallic embroidery no one including me would want to read ) , and my themes , which became darker and darker . My characters generally embodied the attitude that life is always going to be a damn nasty and probably baffling business , but somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , can eventually lead to terrible cynicism , since I knew life was n't like that at all  --  but was a lot more interesting ? only I could n't write about it that way . Though before that could happen , I lost heart in stringing such things together , became distracted , and quit . Bert assures me his own lines took on the same glum , damask quality . " Waking each day / at the end / of a long cave / soil is jammed / in my nostrils / I bite through / soil and roots / and bones and / dream of a separate existence " were some he quoted me from memory one day right on the train . He quit writing not long after he wrote them and went chasing after his students for relief .  | It is no coincidence that I got married just as my literary career and my talents for it were succumbing to gross seriousness . I was crying out , you might say , for the play of light and dark , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private life . I was seeing that same long and empty horizon that X says she sees now , the table set for one , and I needed to turn from literature back to life , where I could get somewhere . It is no loss to mankind when one writer decides to call it a day . When a tree falls in the forest , who cares but the monkeys ? By a quarter to ten I have surrendered to the day and am in my Malibu and down Hoving Road , headed for the Great Woods Road and the Pheasant Run &; Meadow condos where Vicki lives  --  really nearer to Hightstown than to Haddam proper . Something brief should be said , I think , about Haddam , where I 've lived these fourteen years and could live forever . It is not a hard town to understand . Picture in your mind a small Connecticut village , say Redding Ridge or Easton , or one of the nicer fieldstone-wall suburbs back of the Merritt Parkway , and I laddam is like these , more so than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wool merchant from Long Island named Wallace Haddam , the town is a largely wooded community of twelve thousand souls set in the low and rolly hills of the New Jersey central section , east of the Delaware . It is on the train line midway between New York and Philadelphia , and for that reason it 's not so easy to say what we 're a suburb of  --  commuters go both ways . Though as a result , a small-town , out-of-the-mainstream feeling exists here , as engrossed as any in New I Iampshire , but retaining the best of what New Jersey offers : assurance that mystery is never longed for , nor meaningful mystery shunned . This is the reason a town like New Orleans defeats itself . It longs for a mystery it does n't have and never will , if it ever did . New Orleans should take my advice and take after Haddam , where it is not at all hard for a literalist to contemplate the world . It is not a churchy town , though there are enough around because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequest from Wallace Haddam ) . They have their own brick and copper Scottish Reform Assembly with a choir and organ that raises the roof three days a week . But it is a village with its business in the world .  | There is a small , white-painted , colonial Square in the center of town facing north , but no real main street . Most people who live here work elsewhere , often at one of the corporate think-tanks out in the countryside . Otherwise they are seminarians or rich retirees or faculty of De Tocqueville Academy out Highway 160 . There are a few high-priced shops behind mullioned windows  --  men 's stores and franchised women 's undergarments salons are in ascendance . Book stores are down . Aggressive , sometimes bad-tempered divorcees ( some of them seminarians ' ex-wives ) own most of the shops , and they have given the Square a fussy , homespun air that reminds you of life pictured in catalogs ( a view I rather like ) . It is not a town that seems very busy . The Post Office holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and home shoppers . It 's no chore to get a walk-in haircut , or if you 're out alone at night  --  which I often was after my divorce  --  it is n't hard to get a drink bought for you up at the August Inn by some old plaid-pantser watching the ball game , happy to hear a kind word about Ike instead of heading home to his wife . Sometimes for the price of a few daiquiris and some ardent chitchat , it 's even possible to coax a languid insurance broker 's secretary to drive with you out to a roadhouse up the Delaware , and to take in the warm evening of springtime . Such nights often do n't turn out badly , and in the first few months , I spent several in that way without regrets . There is a small , monied New England emigre contingent , mostly commuters down to Philadelphia with summer houses on the Cape and on Lake Winnepesaukee . And also a smaller southern crowd ? mostly Carolinians attached to the seminary  --  with their own winter places on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either bunch ( even when X and I first got here ) , but am part of the other , largest group who 're happy to be residents year-round , and who act as if we were onto something fundamental that 's not a matter of money , I do n't think , but of a certain awareness : living in a place is one thing we all went to college to learn how to do properly , and now that we 're adults and the time has arrived , we 're holding on . Republicans run the local show , which is not as bad as it might  | seem . Either they 're tall , white-haired , razor-jawed old galoots from Yale with moist blue eyes and aromatic OSS backgrounds ; or else retired chamber of commerce boosters , little guys raised in town , with their own circle of local friends , and a conservator 's clear view about property values and private enterprise know-how . A handful of narrow-eyed Italians run the police  --  descendants of the immigrants who were brought over in the twenties to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where X lives . Between them , the Republicans and Italians , the rule that location is everything gets taken seriously , and things run as quietly as anyone could want ? which makes you wonder why that combination does n't run the country better . ( I am lucky to be here with my pre-1975 dollars . ) On the down side , taxes are sky high . The sewage system could use a bond issue , particularly in X 's neighborhood . But there are hardly any crimes against persons . There are doctors aplenty and a fair hospital . And because of the southerly winds , the climate 's as balmy as Baltimore 's . Editors , publishers , Time and Newsweek writers , CIA agents , entertainment lawyers , business analysts , plus the presidents of a number of great corporations that mold opinion , all live along these curving roads or out in the country in big secluded houses , and take the train to Gotham or Philadelphia . Even the servant classes , who are mostly Negroes , seem fulfilled in their summery , keyboardawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they own their own homes . All in all it is not an interesting town to live in . But that 's the way we like it . Because of that , the movie theater is never noisy after the previews and the thanks-for-not-smoking notices . The weekly paper has mostly realty ads , and small interest in big news . The seminary and boarding school students are rarely in evidence and seem satisfied to stay put behind their iron gates . Both liquor stores , the Gulf station and the book stores are happy to extend credit . The Coffee Spot , where I sometimes ride up early on Ralph 's old Schwinn , opens at five A.M. with free coffee . The three banks do n't bounce your checks ( an  | officer calls ) . Black boys and white boys  --  Ralph was one  --  play on the same sports teams , study together nights for the SATs and attend the small brick school . And if you lose your wallet , as I have , on some elm-shaded street of historical reproductions  --  my Tudor is kitty-cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New Jersey Supreme Court  --  you can count on getting a call by dinner just before someone 's teenage son brings it over with all the credit cards untouched and no mention of a reward . You could complain that such a town does n't fit with the way the world works now . That the real world 's a worse and devious and complicated place to lead a life in , and I should get out in it with the Rhonda Matuzaks of life . Though in the two years since my divorce I 've sometimes walked out in these winding , bowery streets after dark on some ruminative errand or other and looked in at these same houses , windows lit with bronzy cheer , dark cars hove to the curbs , the sound of laughing and glasses tinking and spirited chatter floating out , and thought to myself : what good rooms these are . What complete life is here , audible  --  the Justice 's is the one I 'm thinking of . And though I myself was n't part of it and would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think all of us were living steadfast and accountable lives . Who can say ? Perhaps the Justice himself might have his own dark hours on the streets . Maybe some poor man 's life has hung in the balance down in sad Yardville , and the lights in my house  --  I usually leave them blazing  --  have given the Justice solace , moved him to think that we all deserve another chance . I may only be inside working over some batting-average charts , or reading Ring or poring through a catalog in the breakfast nook , hopeful of nothing more than a good dream . But it is for just such uses that suburban streets are ideal , and the only way neighbors here can be neighborly . Certainly it 's true that since there is so much in the world now , it 's harder to judge what is and is n't essential , all the way down to where you should live . That 's another reason I quit real writing and got a real job in the reliable business of sports . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and did n't care to risk  | speculating . And I still do n't . That we all look at it from someplace , and in some hopeful-useful way , is about all I found I could say ? my best , most honest effort . And that is n't enough for literature , though it did n't bother me much . Nowadays , I 'm willing to say yes to as much as I can : yes to my town , my neighborhood , my neighbor , yes to his car , her lawn and hedge and rain gutters . Let things be the best they can be . Give us all a good night 's sleep until it 's over . Hoving Road this morning is as sun-dappled and vernal as any privet lane in England . Across town the bells of St. Leo the Great chime a brisk call to worship , which explains why no Italian gardeners are working on any neighbors ' lawns , clearing out under the forsythias and cutting back the fire thorns . Some of the houses have sunny Easter-lily decorations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Episcopal practice of Christmas wreaths up till Easter morning . There is a nice ecumenical feel of holiday to every street . The Square this morning is filled up with Easter buyers , and to avoid tie-ups I take the " back door " down Wallace Hill through the little one-ways behind the hospital Emergency entrance and the train station . And soon I am out onto the Great Woods Road , which leads to U.S. 1 and across the main train line into the suave and caressing literalness of the New jersey coastal shelf . It is the very route I took yesterday afternoon when I drove to Brielle . And whereas then ' my spirits were tentative  --  I still had this morning 's duties ahead  --  today they are rising and soaring . Six miles out , Route 33 is astream with cars , though a remnant fog from early morning has clung to the roadway as it sways and swerves toward Asbury Park . A light rain draws in a soughing curtain of apple greens from the south and across the accompanying landscape , softening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheerless Ditch Witch dealers . Though I am not displeased by New jersey . Far from it . Vice implies virtue to me , even in landscape , and virtue value . An American would be crazy to reject such a place , since it is the most diverting and readable of landscapes , and the language is always American .  | An Attractive Retirement Waits Just Ahead ' Better to come to earth in New jersey than not to come at all . Or worse , to come to your senses in some spectral place like Colorado or California , or to remain up in the dubious airs searching for some right place that never existed and never will . Stop searching . Face the earth where you can . Literally speaking , it 's all you have to go on . Indeed , in its homeliest precincts and turn-outs , the state feels as unpretentious as Cape Cod once might 've , and its bustling **36;739;TOOLONG mix of life makes it the quintessence of the town-and-country spirit . Illusion will never be your adversary here . An attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up the winding asphalt access that passes beneath a great water tower of sleek space-age blue , then divides toward one end or the other of a wide , unused cornfield . Far ahead  --  a mile , easy  --  billowing green basswoods stand poised against a platinum sky and behind them the long , girdered " Y " stanchions of a high-voltage line , orange balls strung to its wires to warn away low-flying planes . Pheasant Run to the left is a theme-organized housing development where all the streets are cull-de-sac with " Hedgerow Place " and " The Thistles " painted onto fake Andrew Wyeth barnboard signs . All the plantings are young , but fancy cars already sit in the driveways . Vicki and I drove through once like tourists , admiring the farm-shingled and old-brick homesteads with price tags bigger than I paid for my three-story in town fourteen years ago . Vicki 's father and stepmother live in the same sort of place down in Barnegat Pines , and I have a feeling she would like nothing better than for herself and some prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other lower end of the stubble field ? a boxy , unscenic complex of low brown-shake buildings overlooking a shallow man-made mud pond , a yellow bulldozer , and some other apartments already half-built . In the ideal plan of things , these are for the younger people just starting in the world and on the way up  --  secretaries , car salesmen , nurses , who will someday live to buy  | the complete houses over in Pheasant Run on resale . Starter people , I call them . Vicki 's aqua Dart sits out front in slot 31 , still with black and white Texas plates , and shining with polish . The last hiss of rain squall thrums off north into the Brunswicks as I pull in beside her , and the air is thick with a silvery , chemical smell . But before I can get out , and to my surprise , I see Vicki in the front seat of her car , nearly hidden by its big head rest . I roll down the passenger window and she sits peeking out at me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loretta Lynn style , two thick swags taken toward the back of her head and ears , then straight down in sausage curls to her shoulders . Across in the new units two hardhats sit grinning on unfinished Level Two . It 's clear they 've been having a good time over something before I got here . " I figured you probably would n't show up , " Vicki says out her open window , as tentative as a school girl . " I was sitting up there waiting on the phone to ring for you to give me the bad news , and so I just came down here and listened to some tapes I like to hear when I 'm sad . " She smiles out at me , a sweet-natured , chancy smile . " You 're not going to be hot at me are you ? " " If you do n't get over here in about two seconds I am , " I say . " I knew it , " she says , running her window up quick and grabbing her bag , bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling . " I told myself , I said , self , if you go out there he 'll come , and sure enough . " All fears are put instantly to rest , leaving the two hardhats shaking their heads . I would n't mind , as I back out , blinking my lights and wishing them just half the fun I 'm expecting . But they 'd probably get the wrong idea . As we back up , though , I give them a grin and we wheel out of Pheasant Meadow down the access road toward Route 33 and the NJTP , Vicki cleaving to me , squeezing my arm and sighing like a new cheerleader . " Why 'd you think I would n't show up ? " I say , as we weave  | through rain-drenched Hightstown , and I am thinking how glad I am to own a car with an old-fashioned bench seat . " Oh it 's just old silly-milly . Seemed like too good a thing to happen , I guess . " Vicki is wearing black slacks that fit her tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a blue Ultrasuede jacket straight from Dallas and shoes with clear plastic heels . These are her dressy travel clothes , along with her nylon Le Sac weekender tossed in the back and her little black clutch where she keeps her diaphragm . She is a girl for every modern occasion , and I find I can be interested in the smallest particulars of her life . She stares out as the upright Federalist buildings of Hightstown slide past . " Plus . I had a patient kick out on me last night just right when I was talking to him , asking him questions about how he felt and everything . I was n't even s'posed to be workin , but a gal got sick . He was this colored man . And he was C-liver terminal , already way into uremia when he admitted , which is not that bad cause it usually starts ' em dreamin about their pasts and off their current problem . " ( A tiny sigh of relief as to her whereabouts last night . I had called and found no one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only you do n't really get that used to death , which is why I came down to ER from ONC . We 're supposed to be used to it and all , but I 'm just not . I 'd lot rather see a guy busted up and bleeding than some guy dying inside . I guess that was why I started worrying . I knew you went to the cemetery this morning . " " That all went fine , though , " I say , and in most ways it did . Vicki takes a Merit Light out of her little purse and lights up . She is not the kind of girl who smokes , but likes to smoke when she 's nervous . I reach a hand across her plump thighs and pull her closer to me , leg-side to leg-side . She lowers her window a crack and blows smoke that way . " When 's your birthday , anyway ? " " Next week . " " Okay , that 's what you 're supposed to say . Now when is it really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thirty-nine . " I snake a glance down to see if there 's adverse reaction to this news . We have not  | discussed my age in the eight weeks I 've known her . I assume she thinks I 'm younger . " You are not . Liar . " " I 'm afraid it 's true , " I say , and try to smile . " Well , maybe I 'll make you a present of an eight-track , and tape you all my favorites . How 'd you like that ? " There is no more reaction to this news about my age . There are women I know who care about men 's ages , and women who do n't . X did n't , and I have always counted that as a sign of good sense . Though where Vicki is concerned  --  her possible reasons for not caring are probably related to a bad first marriage and a wish to hook up with someone at least kind  --  it is another in a burgeoning number of happy surprises . Maybe we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pheasant Run , and live happily like the rest of our fellow Americans . What would be wrong with that ? " I 'd like that fine , " I say . " You were n't mad at me for hein out in the car like a tart ? " " You 're too pretty to be mad at . " " That 's about what them dimwits thought , too . " We approach the Turnpike , take our ticket and start north , above the flat , featureless bedrenched Jersey flatlands  --  a landscape perfect for easy golf courses , valve plants and flea markets . The reason Vicki is worried that I would be mad at not getting to come to her door is because she knows I love the tribal ritual of picking her up for our dates , even if I 'm hoping to spend the night . Usually I am formal and bring a gift , something I quit doing long ago when X and I went on outings . Though it 's true that X and I lived together , and such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually bring something down from New York , where she has only been once and claims she ca n't abide . For her part , she is always almost ready and pretends I hurry her , runs to the bedroom with straight pins in her mouth , or holding her hair up in back , needing to stitch a hem or iron a pleat . We are throwbacks in this , straight out of an earlier era , but I like this nervous and over-produced manner of things between us . We seem to know what each other  | wants without really knowing each other , which was a dilemma between X and me at the end . We did n't seem to be tending the same ways . Though it may simply be that at my age I 'm satisfied with less and with things less complicated . Whatever the reason , I 'm always happy when I am invited to spend the night or just an hour waiting in the pristine and nursey neatness of Vicki 's little 1-BR condo , on which her dad holds the note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind trip to the Miracle Furniture Mile in Paramus . Vicki made all her own choices : pastel poof-drapes , sunburst mirror , bright area rugs with abstract designs , loveseat with a horseand-buggy print , a maple mini-dining room suite , a China-black enamel coffee table , all brown appliances and a whopper Sony . All Wade Arcenault had to do was write a big check and set his little girl 's life back on track after the bad events with husband Everett . Each time I 'm inside , all is precisely as it was the time before , as if riveted in place and clean as newsprint : a fresh Nurse magazine , a soap opera archive and TV Guide shingling the piecrust table . A shiny saxophone on its stand unused since high school band days . The guest bathroom spotless . Dishes washed and put away . Everything reliable as the newly-wed suite in the Holiday Inn . My own house represents other aims , with its comfortable , overstuffed entities , full magazine racks , faded orientals , creaky sills and the general residue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( many unmet ) , yet evidence that does not announce a life 's real quality any more eloquently than a new Barca Lounger or a Kitchen Magician , no matter what you 've heard . In fact , I have become a committed no-muss , no-fuss fellow . And the idea appeals to me of starting life over in such a new and genial place with an instant infusion of colorful , fresh and impersonal furnishings . I might 've done the same if it had n't been for Paul and Clarissa , and if I had n't believed I was n't so much starting a new life as raising the ante on an old one . And if I had n't felt our house was still a sound investment . All of which has worked out well , and most nights I drift off to sleep ( wherever I am  --  a St. Louis , an Atlanta , a Mil-  | waukee or even a Pheasant Meadow ) convinced I have come away , as they say , with the best of both worlds  --  the very thing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinching at her sausage curls in the visor mirror . " Does n't it seem strange to you we 'd be takin a trip together ? " She squinches up her nose , first at her own face then at mine , as if she did n't expect to hear a word she could believe . " This is what grownups do  --  go on trips together , stay in hotels , 11 have wonderful times . " " Rilly ? " ' ' Really. , , " Well . I guess . " She takes a bobby pin out of her blouse cuff and puts it in her mouth . " It just never seemed like anything I 'd be doin . Everett and me went to Galveston sometimes . I been to Mexico , but just to cross over . " She removes the pin and buries it deep in her black hair . " What are you , anyway , by the way ? " " I 'm a sportswriter . " " Yes , I know that . I read things you wrote . " ( This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , arc you Libra or the Twins . You said your birthday was n't but less than a month from now . I want to figure you out . " " I 'm the Taurus . " " What does that one mean ? " She watches me keenly now out the side of her eye while she finishes with her hair . " I 'm pretty intelligent . I 'm not cynical , but I 'm intuitive about people , and that might make me seem cynical . " All this comes straight from Mrs. Miller , my palmist . It is part of her service to give information like this if I ask her for it , in addition to speculating on the future . I try to see her at least every two weeks . " I 'm also pretty generous . " " I 'll admit that , at least you been that with me . I wonder if that stuff 'll make your dreams come true . I do n't know much about it . I guess I could learn more . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She folds her arms under her breasts like a high school girlfriend and stares straight ahead for miles . It is possible to think of her as being sixteen and chaste instead of thirty and divorced ; as never having witnessed a single bad or unhappy thing , despite the fact she attends death and mayhem nearly every day . " Well , look , " she says , staring up the Turnpike . " Did you know I always wanted to go to Detroit ? " She pronounces Detroit so as to rhyme with knee-joint . " No . " " Well then all right . I did though . I almost fell over when you asked me . " She puts her chin down as though deep in serious thought and makes a little clucking sound with her tongue . " If you 'd asked me to go to Washington , D.C. , or Chicago , Illinois , or Timbuktu , I probably would 've said no . But when I was a little girl my Daddy used to always say , De-troit makes , the world takes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured I had to see it . It seemed so unusual , you know , to me . And romantic . He 'd gone up there to work after the Korean War , and when he came back he had a picture postcard of a great big tire stood up on its tread . And that 's what I wanted to see , but I never got to . I got married instead on the way to no place special . Then I met you . " She smiles up at me sweetly and puts her hand inside my thigh in a way she has n't quite done before , and I have to keep from swerving and causing a big pile-up . We are just now passing Exit 9 , New Brunswick , and I take a secret look over along the line of glass booths , only two of which are lighted OPEN and have cars pulling through . Indistinct , gray figures lean out and lean back , give directions , make change , point toward surface roads for weary travelers . What could he more fortuitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll-taker 's only daughter is with you and creeping up on your big-boy with tender , skillful fingers ? " Do you like my name ? " She keeps her hand close up on my leg , her built-on fingernails doing a little audible skip-dance . " I think it 's great . " " Is that right ? " She squinches her nose again . " I never liked it ,  | but thanks . I do n't mind Arcenault . I like that . But Vicki sounds like a name you 'd see on a bracelet at Walgreen 's . " She glances at me , then back toward the wide estuary and wetlands of the Raritan , stretching like wheat to the tip of Staten Island and the Amboys . " Looks like someplace the world died out there , does n't it ? " " I like it out there , " I say . " Sometimes you can imagine you 're in Egypt . Sometimes you can even see the World Trade Center . " She gives my leg a friendly pinch and turns me loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You probably would like that . You 're in from the nut department , too . Tell me what that little boy of yours died of ? " " Reye 's . " She shakes her head as though mystified . " Boy-shoot . What 'd you do when he died ? " This is a question I 'm not interested in exploring , though I know she would n't ask if she were n't concerned about me and felt some good could come out of it . She is as much a literalist in these matters as I am , and much more savvy about men than I am about women . " We were both sitting beside his bed . It was early in the morning . Before light . We may have been asleep , really . But a nurse came in and said , I 'm sorry , Mr. Bascombe , Ralph has expired . ' We both just sat there a few minutes , stunned , though we knew it was going to happen . And then she cried a while and I did , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon and toast , and ended up watching television . I had a tape of great NBA championships , and I watched that until it got light . " " lleath 'll make you nutty , wo n't it ? " Vicki rests her head on the seat back , pulls her feet up , and hugs her shiny black knees . Far ahead I see a plane  --  a great jet  --  floating earthward where I know Newark airport to be ; it is a promising sign . " You know what we did when my Mama died ? " She glances up , as if to see if I 'm still here . " No . " " We all went out and ate Polynesian . It was n't a big surprise or anything , either . She had everything you can have and I was working  | right in Texas Shriners and knew everything from talking to the doctors , which I do n't think is really that good . Everett and Daddy , Cade and me , though , went out to the Garland Mall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just wanted to eat . I think you want to eat when someone dies . Then we just went and spent money . I bought a gold add-a-bead necklace I did n't need . Daddy bought a three-piece suit at Dillards ' and a new wristwatch . Cade bought something . And Everett bought a new-used red Corvette he probably still owns , I guess . He did have it . " She extends her lower lip over the other one and focuses down beetle-browed on the visible memory of Everett 's Corvette , which stands out now more than death . I Ier nature is to put her faith in objects more than essences . And in most ways that makes her the perfect companion . I Ier story , however , has left me with an unexpected gloominess . Some aspects of hidden-life-revealed have a certain bedrock factuality I do n't like . I 'd be a braver soldier if the story had someone discovering they had Lou Gehrig 's disease or a brain tumor on the eve of his last track meet , and deciding to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions  --  vivid ones  --  of true death , and I suddenly feel , whipping along the girdered Turnpike , exactly as I did that morning I described : bereaved and in jeopardy of greater bereavement sweeping me up . Women have always lightened my burdens , picked up my faltering spirits and exhilarated me with the old anything-goes feeling , though anything does n't go , of course , and never did . Only this time the solace-spirit has been sucked out of the car by a vagrant boxcar wind , leaving my stomach twitching and my mouth grimmed as though the worst were happening . I have slipped for a moment out onto that plane where women ca n't help in the age-old ways ( this , of course , is something X said this morning and I passed off ) . Not that I 've lost the old yen , just that the old yen seems suddenly defeatable by facts , the kind you ca n't sidestep  --  the essence of a small empty moment . Vicki eyes me in little threatening glances , her brows arched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? "  | If we were as far north as the Vince Lombardi Rest Area , I 'd pull in and spend a half-hour admiring Vince 's memorabilia  --  the bronze bust , the picture of the Five Blocks of Granite , the famous gabardine overcoat . We have plenty of time today . But Vince 's Area is all the way past Giant 's Stadium , and we are here down among the flaming refineries , without a haven . " Would you just give me a big hug , " I say . " You 're a wonderful girl . " And instantly she throws an armlock around me with a neckcrunching ferocity . " Oh , oh , oh , " she sighs into my ear , and as easy as that ( I was not wrong ) rapture rises in me . " Does it make you happy to have me here ? " She is patting my cheek softly and staring straight at it . " We 're going to have us some fun , you better believe what I say . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy blue . " She kisses my ear until my legs tingle , and I want to squeeze my eyes shut and give up control . This is enough to bring us back up to ground level , and send us to the airport with all my old hopes ascendant . I am easily rescued , it 's true . At this moment it may be of interest to say a word about athletes , whom I have always admired without feeling the need to be one or to take them at all seriously , and yet who seem to me as literal and within themselves as the ancient Greeks ( though with their enterprises always hopeful ) . Athletes , by and large , are people who arc happy to let their actions speak for them , happy to be what they do . As a result , when you talk to an athlete , as I do all the time in locker rooms , in hotel coffee shops and hallways , standing beside expensive automobiles ? even if he 's paying no attention to you at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to feel the least bit divided , or alienated , or one ounce of existential dread . He may be thinking about a case of beer , or a barbecue , or some man-made lake in Oklahoma he wishes he was waterskiing on , or some girl or a new Chevy shortbed ,  | or a discotheque he owns as a tax shelter , or just simply himself . But you can bet he is n't worried one bit about you and what you 're thinking . His is a rare selfishness that means he is n't looking around the sides of his emotions to wonder about alternatives for what he 's saying or thinking about . In fact , athletes at the height of their powers make literalness into a mystery all its own simply by becoming absorbed in what they 're doing . Years of athletic training teach this ; the necessity of relinquishing doubt and ambiguity and self-inquiry in favor of a pleasant , selfchampioning one-dimensionality which has instant rewards in sports . You can even ruin everything with athletes simply by speaking to them in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speculation . It will scare them to death by demonstrating that the world  --  where they often do n't do too well and sometimes fall into depressions and financial imbroglios and worse once their careers are over  --  is complexer than what their training has prepared them for . As a result , they much prefer their own voices and questions or the jabber of their teammates ( even if it 's in Spanish ) . And if you are a sportswriter you have to tailor yourself to their voices and answers : " How are you going to beat this team , Stu ? " Truth , of course , can still be the result ? " We 're just going out and play our kind of game , Frank , since that 's what 's got us this far " ? but it will be their simpler truth , not your complex one  --  unless , of course , you agree with them , which I often do . ( Athletes , of course , are not always the dummies they 're sometimes portrayed as being , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears turn to cement . ) An athlete , for example , would never let a story like the one Vicki just told me get to him , even though the same feelings might strike him in the heart . He is trained not to let it bother him too much or , if it bothers him more than he can stand , to go outside and hit five hundred balls off the practice tee or run till he drops , or bash himself head-on into a piece of complicated machinery . I admire that quality more than almost any other I can think of . He knows what makes him happy , what makes him mad , and what to do about  | each . In this way he is a true adult . ( Though for that , it 's all but impossible for him to be your friend . ) For the last year I was married to X , I was always able to " see around the sides " of whatever I was feeling . If 1 was mad or ecstatic , I always realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to  --  somber or resentful , ironic or generous  --  even though I might 've been convinced that the way I was acting probably represented the way I really felt even if I had n't seen the other ways open . This can be an appealing way to live your life , since you can convince yourself you 're really just a tolerant generalist and kind toward other views . I even had , in fact , a number of different voices , a voice that wanted to be persuasive , to promote good effects , to express love and be sincere , and make other people happy  --  even if what I was saying was a total lie and as distant from the truth as Athens is from Nome . It was a voice that totally lacked commitment , though it may ill well be this is as close as you can ever come to yourself , your own voice , especially with someone you love : mutual agreement with no significant irony . This is what people mean when they say that so-and-so is " distanced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you reach adulthood that distance has to close until you no longer see those choices , but simply do what you do and feel what you feel  --  marriage you may have to relinquish , of course . " Seeing around " is exactly what I did in my stories ( though I did n't know it ) , and in the novel I abandoned , and one reason why I had to quit . I could always think of other ways I might be feeling about what I was writing , or other voices I might be speaking in . In fact , I could usually think of quite a number of things I might be doing at any moment ! And what real writing requires , of course , is that you merge into the oneness of the writer 's vision  --  something I could never quite get the hang of , though I tried like hell and eventually sunk myself . X was always clear as spring water about how she felt and why she did everything . She was completely reliable and resistant to nuance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow like me to be married to , though I 'm not certain she 's so sure about things now . Though about athletes , I want to say just one more thing : you T can learn too much about them , even learn to dislike them , just as you can with anybody . When you look very closely , the more everybody seems just alike  --  unsurprising and factual . And for that reason I sometimes tell less than I know , and for my money the boys in my racket make a mistake with in-depth interviews . I 'd just as soon pull a good heartstring . Write about the skinny Negro kid from Bradenton , Florida , who ca n't read , suffered rickets and had scrapes with the law , yet who later accepts a basketball scholarship to a major midwestern university , becomes a star , learns to read and eventually majors in psychology , marries a white girl and later starts a consulting firm in Akron . That is a good story . Maybe the white girl would be of eastern European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . If all this makes it seem that being a sportswriter is at best a superficial business , that 's because it is . And it is not for that reason a bad profession at all . Nor am I , I will admit , altogether imperfectly suited for it . t Terminal A we become two veteran travelers . I stand in line at United while Vicki goes to powder her nose and buy flight insurance . As it turns out , she is as much a denizen of airports as I am . When everything turned bad with old dagger-head Everett , she informed me on the escalator , she used to drive out to the new airport in Dallas , watch planes leave , and pretend she was on all of them . " If you stayed in that airport for one year , " she said , beaming like a carhop as we headed up the glittering ticket concourse full of passengers and loved ones looking for partners , " you 'd see everybody in the world . And you 'd sure see Charley Pride a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance to be the world 's best bargain ,  | and who am I to say no , though I advise her not to make me her beneficiary . " Well , I guess not , " she says , with a vaguely disgusted look . " I always make the R.C. Church my heir in everything . " " That 's fine then , " I say , though she and I have never discussed religion . " I just went to Catholics when I married Everett , in case you 're wondering , " she says , and looks at me oddly . " They do a lot for the hospitals . And the Pope 's a good old guy I think . 1 wad n't but a dirty Methodist before , like everybody else in Texas except the Baptists . " " That 's great , " I say and give her arm a squeeze . " Freedom to choose , " she says , then skitters away toward the insurance machines . By wide degrees now I am better . Public places always work this curative on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agoraphobia . I enjoy the freely shared air of the public . It is , in a way , my element . Even the yellow-aired Greyhound terminals and murky subway stations make me feel a well-being , that a place has been provided for me and my fellow man together . When I was married to X , I hated the grinding summer weeks we 'd spend first at the FIuron Mountain Club , and , later , at Sumac Hills down in Birmingham , where her father was a founding member . 1 hated that still air of privilege and the hushed , nervous noises of midwestern exclusivity . I thought it was bad for the children and kept stealing off with Ralph to the Detroit Zoo and the Belle Isle Botanical Garden , and once all the way out to the Arboretum in Ann Arbor . X 's had been an entire life of privilege  --  clubs and reserved tables and private boxes at the ball game  --  though I think all that means nothing if you have a sound enough character to weather it , which she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face I recognize but hope to get away without acknowledging . It is the long face of Fincher Barksdale . Fincher is holding his white United ticket folder and has a big TWA golf bag over his shoulder . Fincher  | is my internist , and I have visited him , as I said , to inquire about my pounding heart , and have heard from him that it is likely a matter of my age , and that many men approaching forty suffer from symptoms inexplicable to medical science , and that in a while they just go away by themselves . Fincher is one of those lanky , hairy-handed , hip-thrown , vaguely womanish southerners who usually become bored lawyers or doctors , and whom I do n't like , though X and I were friendly with him and his wife , Dusty , when we first came to Haddam and I had a small celebrity with my picture in Newsweek . He is a Vanderbilt grad , and older than I am by at least three years though he looks younger . He took his medicine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not like him one bit , I am happy to have him be my doctor . I try to look away in a hurry , out the big window toward the spiritless skyline of Newark , but I 'm sure Fincher has already seen me and is waiting to be sure I 've seen him and absolutely do n't want to talk to him before he pipes up . " Now look out here . Where 're we slippin off to , brother Frank . " It is Fincher 's booming southern baritone , and without even looking I know he is stifling a white , toothy smile , tongue deep in his cheek , and having a wide look around to see who else might be listening in . He extends me his soft hand without actually noticing me . We are not old fraternity brothers . He was a phi Delt , though he once suggested we might have a distant aunt in common , some Bascombe connection of his from Memphis . But 1 squelched it . " Business , Fincher , " I say nonchalantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't come back anytime soon . Fincher is a veteran lecher and would take pleasure in making me squirm on account of my traveling companion . One of the bad things about public places is that you sometimes see people you would pay money not to see . Fincher is wearing green jackass pants with little crossed ensigns in red , a blue Augusta National pullover and black-tasseled spectator shoes . He looks like a fool , and is undoubtedly flying off on a golfing  | package somewhere  --  Kiawah Island , where he shares a condo , or San Diego , where he goes for doctors ' conventions six or eight times a year . " What about you , Fincher ? " I say , without the slightest interest . " Just a hop down to Memphis , Frank , down to Memphis for the holiday . " Fincher rocks back on his heels and jingles change in his pockets . He makes no mention of his wife . " Since we lost Daddy , Frank , I go down more , of course . Mother 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends have closed ranks around her . " Fincher is the kind of southerner who will only address you through a web of deep and antic southernness , and who assumes everybody in earshot knows all about his parents and history and wants to hear an update on them at every opportunity . He looks young , but still manages to act sixty-five . " Glad to hear it , Fincher . " I take a peek down past Delta and Allegheny to see if Vicki 's coming this way . If Fincher and the two of us are flying the same flight , I 'll change airlines . " Frank , I 've got a little business venture I want to tell you about . I started to get into it in the office the other day , but things went right on and got ahead of me . It 's something you absolutely ought to consider . We 're past the venture capital stages , but you can still get in on the second floor . " " We 're due out of here in a minute , Fincher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we here with , Frank ? " A definite mistake there . I have set Fincher nosing all around again like a bird dog . " With a friend , Fincher . " " I see . Now this is one minute to tell , Frank . Just while we 're standing here . See now , some boys and I are starting up a mink ranch right down in south Memphis , Frank . It 's always been my dream , for some damn reason . " Fincher smiles at me in stupid selfamazement . He is picturing his stupid farm at this moment , I can tell , his tiny lizard 's eyes dull with lusterless blue absorption . They are without question the peepers of a fool . " It 'd get hot for the minks , would n't it ? " " Oh well , you have to air-condition , Frank . Definitely . No way  | around that mountain . The start-up 's sky high , too . " Fincher is nodding like a banker , his blond and grayed head a pleasant puzzle of fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives whatever 's down there another stern jingle . Though just for the moment I am struck by Fincher 's hair , the thinning top of which sinks into view as he glances ritually at his spectators . His hair is barbered into the dopey-blond Tab Hunter brushcut circa 1959 , crisp as a saltine and with just a soupcon of odorless colloid to hold it in place . He is the perfect southerner-in-exile , a slewfooted mainstreet change jingler in awful clothes  --  a breed known only outside the south . At Vandy he was the tallish , bookish Memphian meant for a wider world  --  brushcut , droopy suntans , white bucks , campaign belt and a baggy long-sleeved Oxford shirt , hands stuffed in his pockets , arrogantly bored yet supremely satisfied and accustomed to the view from his eyrie . ( Essentially the very way he is now . ) At Hopkins he met and married a girl from Goucher who could n't stand the South and craved the suburbs as if they were the Athens of Pericles , and Fincher has been free ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other southern renegades of whom , as I 've said , there is a handsome cadre . When the awful day of reckoning comes to Fincher , I want to be somewhere far away in a boat , I know that . " Frank , " Fincher says , having gone on talking about mink farms while I rode up over the clouds , " now do n't you think it 'd be a highwater mark for the New South ? You care about all those things , do n't you ? " " Not much , " I say , and the truth is not at all . " Well now , Frank , everybody thought old Tom Edison was crazy , did n't they ? " Fincher pulls his ticket folder out of his back pocket and whacks it across his palm and smirks . " I 'm pretty sure everybody thought Edison was smart , Fincher . " " Okay . You know what I mean , son . " " It 's forward thinking , Fincher , I 'll give it that much . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the signal he has been waiting for . And for a moment we  | stand in silence among hundreds of milling passengers , just the way we might stand together at the window up in the Petroleum Club in Memphis , brainstorming and conniving over next year 's tail-gate party at the Commodore  --  Ole Miss game . Somehow or other Fincher has managed to set himself at ease , despite my reservations with his mink farm , and I actually admire him for it . " You know , Frank . I 've probably never said this to you . " Fincher nods his head like a sage old trial judge . " But I admire the hell out of what you do and how you lead your life . There 's a lot of us would like to do that , but lack the nerve and the dedication . " " What 1 do 's pretty easy , Fincher . You 'd probably be as good at it as I am . You ought to give it a try . " I squeeze my toes inside my shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chains and beat me with a stick to get me to write , Frank . I get the ants nowadays just writing a scrip . " Fincher 's mouth mulls down in a mock-grimace . He secretly knows he could do it as well as I can and most likely better , but feels the need to pay me some kind of unfelt compliment . " There 's a whole lot of us would like to mouse off with a little nurse , too , " Fincher says with a big wink . I turn and look off down the crowded concourse and see Vicki skittering back with her insurance papers , walking with difficulty on her plastic high heels . She looks like a secretary on an urgent trip to the copy machine , elbows thrown out for balance , her feet seemingly made of wood . Fincher has seen her and recognized her from the hospital halls , and I am caught . Fincher has suddenly adopted the old dirty-leg innuendo he perfected in the Phi Deft house down at Vanderbilt , and means to reduce me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounds us both . He is more untrustworthy than I thought , and I am as on my guard as any man who has something worth defending  --  though wretched ever to have let him hold me in a conversation . Fincher is threatening to pull the plug on all anticipation , and I 'll be damned if I 'll let him do it . " Why do n't you mind your own business , Fincher , " I say , and  | look him dead in the eyes . I could punch him in the nose , bloody up his jackass pants , and send him home to Memphis in stitches . " Now-now-now . " Fincher raises his chin and saunters back a half step onto his heels , glancing up over my shoulder toward Vicki . " We 're white men , here , Frank . " " I 'm not married anymore , " I say fiercely . " Anything I do is all right . " " Yes indeed . " Fincher flashes his big-tooth smile , but it is for Vicki , not me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been on this very track before me . " Well , look what you see when you are n't properly armed , " Vicki says , fastening a good grip on my arm , and giving Fincher a nasty little smile to let me know she 's got his number . I love her more than I can say . Fincher mumbles something like " mighty small world , " but he has become half-hearted at best . " I got the in-surance , " Vicki says and flutters the papers up to me , ignoring Fincher completely . " You might see a name you know if you look . I changed religions , too . " IIer sweet face is gone plain with seriousness . It is a face I did not even want to see two moments before , but that I welcome now as a friend of my heart . I unfold the thick onionskin sheaf from Mutual of Omaha , and see Vicki 's name here as Victory Wanda Arcenaultand mine partway down as beneficiary . The sum is $150,000 . " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a good ole bird . But I 'll never see him . " She blinks her eyes up at me as if a light had burst into view around my ears . " I 'll see you , though . " I would like to hug her till she squeaked , but not in Fincher 's presence . It would give him something to think about , and I want to give him nothing . At the moment he is standing with his mouth formed into a small , perfect o . " Thanks , " I say . " I liked the idea of you spending all that money and thinking about me . It 'd make me happy then wherever I was . You could buy a Corvette  --  only you 'd probably want a Cadillac . " " I just want you , " I say . " Anyway we 'll be together if it crashes . "  | She rolls her eyes up at the high crystal-lighted airport ceiling . " That 's true , is n't it ? " She takes the policy back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ' spec I 'll just steal on off , " Fincher says , eyes flashy-darty since something has taken place here outside his ken . He has bent himself slightly at the waist and is on the verge of embarrassment , an emotion he has not felt , in all likelihood , for twenty years . The concourse has begun welling up around us with people wearing paper tags on their breasts that say " Get-Away . " They appear from nowhere and begin flowing in the direction of gates 36-51 . The air suddenly smells sweet and peanutty . A plane has been held up for late-arrivers , and a feeling of relief circles us like a spring breeze . 1 , " It 's good to see you , Fincher , " I say . Fincher , of course , is no more a lecher than the rest of us , and I am relieved to let him and his grave Ichabod 's features slip away . " Uh-huh , you bet , " Vicki says and glances at Fincher with distaste , a look he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lettin us on a little early . " Fincher flashes a smile . " You have a good trip , " I say . " Yep , yep , " Fincher says and hoists his clubs onto his bony shoulder . " Do n't do it in the lake , " Vicki says . But Fincher is already out of her range , and I watch him pick up his step with the other expectants , in from Buffalo , his clubs hitched high up , happy to be in with a new crowd , ready for some good earnest talk and armsqueezing on their way south . " You and Fincher have a falling out ? " I say this in a chummy voice . " I ' magine we did . " Vicki is kneeling , elbow-deep in her weekender bag , digging for something at the bottom . We are next up to have our tickets validated . " He 's some kinda joker . A real sneak-upbehind-you guy if you know what that means . A bad potato . We all watch out for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " No sir . " She looks up at me in surpirse . " Nasty mind . I keep an eye on who 's back of me . " " What do you think I think ? " " It 's on your face like eggs . " " I 'm just jealous , " I say . " Ca n't you tell ? " " I would n't know . " She finds a tiny perfume phial from her bag , uncaps it and takes it to her neck and arms while she kneels on the airport floor . She smiles up at me in a spicy way I know she knows I like . " You ai n't got nothin to worry about , lemme tell you , Mister . You 're numero uno and there 's no number two . " " Tell me about Fincher , then . " " One-a-these days . You wo n't be surprised , though , I 'll tell you that . " " You 'd be surprised what surprises me . " " And what do n't surprise me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket line . Her hand 's moist , and the air smells of Chanel No. 5 . " You win . " " Right . I 'm a winner all the way , " she says airily . And if I could make the moment last  --  lost in the anticipation of a safe trip , a fatal crash , a howling success , a grinding bitter failure  --  I would , and never leave this airport , never gain on or rejoin myself , and never know what 's to come , the way you always have to know , though it 's only the same , the same you waiting . On the plane we are in the midwest from the first moment we take our seats . The entire tourist cabin of our 727 virtually vibrates with its grave ying-yangy appeal . Hefty stewardesses with smiles that say " Hey , I could love you once we 're down and safe " stow away our carry-ons . Vicki folds her weekender strap inside and hands it up . " Gaish , now is that ever neat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands on her hips in horsey admiration . " 1 wanta show Barb that . We 've got the pits with our luggage . Where 're you guys headed ? " Sue 's smile shows a big canine that is vaguely tan-colored , but she is full of welcome and good spirits . I Ier father was in the Air force and she has a lot of athletic younger brothers , I would stake my life on it . She 's seen plenty . " De-troit , " Vicki announces proudly , taking a secret peek at me . Sue cocks her blond head to the side with pride . " You gyz 'll love Detroit . " " Well , I 'm really lookin forward to it , " Vicki says with a grin . " Greet , reelly greet , " Sue says and sways off to start the coffee around . All about me , almost immediately , people begin to converse in the soft nasalish voices and mildish sentiments familiar from my college days . Everyone seems to be a native Detroiter heading home 1 Ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit but us . Someone nearby claims to have stayed up and watched an entire telethon and missed two days of work . Someone else headed up to " the thumb " on a fishing trip but had motor trouble and ended up marooned in Bad Axe for a weekend . Someone had started Wayne State and pledged Sigma Nu but by last Christmas was back to work at his dad 's sheet metal business . It might be said , of course , that the interiors of all up-to-date conveyances of travel put one in mind of the midwest . The snug-fitted overhead bins , the comfy pastel re-  | diners , disappearing tray-tables and smorgasbord air of **39;777;TOOLONG . All products of midwestern ingenuity , as surely as a waltz is Viennese . In a little while Barb and Sue circulate hack and conduct a serious Q &A; with Vicki about her weekender bag , which neither of them has seen the exact likes of , they say , and Vicki is only too happy to discuss . Barb is a squat little strawberry blondie with too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in something called " price points " and " mean value mark-up , " and whether or not an identical bag could n't be bought at Hudson 's boutique in a mall near her own condo in Royal Oak ; it turns out she studied retailing in college . Vicki says hers came from joske 's , but that 's all she knows , and the girls talk about Dallas for a while ( Barb and Sue have both been based there at different times ) and Vicki says she likes a store called Spivey 's and a rib place in Cockrell Hill called Atomic Ribs . They all three like each other a lot . Then all at once we 're in the air rising out over the cloud-shaded Watchungs and a bright blue-green industrial river , toward Pennsylvania , making for Lake Erie , and the girls slide off to other duties . Vicki picks up the arm rest and shoves close to me on our three-across seats , her shiny , encased thigh as hard as a saucepan , her breath drowsy with excitement . We are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking about , old Mr. Man ? " She has attached her pair of pink earphones around her neck . " About what a sweet thigh you 've got and how much I 'd like to pull it my way . " " Well you surely can . Wo n't nobody see you but Suzie and little Barbara , and they do n't care long as no clothes come off . " That was n't what you were thinking anyway . I know about you , old tricky . " " I was thinking about Candid Camera . The talking mailbox . I think that 's about the funniest thing I 've ever seen in my life . " " I like ' em , too . Ole Allen Funk . I thought I saw him one day in the hospital . I 'd heard he lived someplace around . But then it was n't . A lot of people look alike now , you know it ? But that still is n't it . I 'll just let you run on . "  | " You 're a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you need to nurse . But I 'm not really smart . I would n't have married Everett if I had been . " She fattens her cheeks and smiles at me . " Are you not gon na tell me what you 're sitting there worrying ? " She takes a good two-armed hold on my arm and squeezes it . She is a girl who likes squeezing . " Or am I gon have to squeeze you till you talk . " She is strong , which I think would also be a requirement for a nurse , though I am sure she does n't really care what 's on my mind . In truth , of course , I have nothing to answer . Undoubtedly I was thinking something , but most things I find myself thinking seem to fly right out of my mind and I ca n't remember them at all . It is a trait of character which made being a writer hard and often downright tedious . I either had to sit down and write out whatever I happened to be thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think it , or else just forget it all , which is what happened at the end of the time I was working on my novel . Finally I became happy to forget everything and let it all lapse . Real writers have to be more attentive , of course , and attentive was what I was n't much interested in being . I do not think , in any event , it 's a good idea to want to know what people are thinking ( that would disqualify you as a writer right there , since what else is literature but somebody telling us what somebody else is thinking ) . For my money there are at least a hundred good reasons not to want to know such things . People never tell the truth anyway . And most people 's minds , like mine , never contain much worth reporting , in which case they just make something up that 's patently ridiculous instead of saying the truth  --  namely , I was thinking nothing . The other side , of course , is that you will run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone is thinking , which can turn out to be something you do n't want to hear , or that makes you mad , and ought to be kept private anyway . I remember when I was a boy in Mississippi , maybe fifteen years old  --  just before I left for Lonesome Pines  --  a friend of mine got killed in a hunting accident . The very night after , Charlieboy Neblett and I ( he was one of my  | few friends in Biloxi ) sat out in Charlieboy 's car drinking beer and complaining about our having thought , then forgiving each other for thinking , that we were glad Teddy Twiford got killed . If Teddy 's mother had come by just then and asked us what we were thinking , she would 've been flabbergasted to find out what lousy friends of Teddy 's we were . Though in fact we were n't lousy friends at all . " Things just come into your mind on their own and are n't your fault . So I learned this all those years ago  --  that you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that by and large you do n't have any business knowing what other people think . Full disclosure never does anybody any favors , and in any event there are few enough people in the world who are sufficiently within themselves to make such disclosure pretty unreliable right from the start . All added to the fact that this constitutes intrusion where you least need to be intruded upon , and where telling can actually do harm to everyone involved . I remember , in fact , the Lebanese woman I knew at Berkshire College saying to me , after I told her how much I loved her : " I 'll always tell you the truth , unless of course I 'm lying to you . " Which ' at first I did n't think was a very good idea ; though stewing over it after a while I realized that it was actually a piece of great luck . I was being promised truth and mystery  --  not an easy combination . There would be important things I would and would n't know , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muse on it , worry about it if I was idiot enough , which I was n't , and all I had to do was agree , and be forever freed . She was a literary deconstructionist and had a mind trained for that kind of distinction . And she managed to make a policy out of a fact of life : how much of someone you can actually get to know about . Very little . Though I do n't think in the three verttTinous. months we spent together she ever lied to me . There was never a reason to ! I saw to that by never asking a question whose answer was n't already obvious . X and I might in fact have made a better go of it if she could 've tried that strategy out on me by not asking me to explain anything that night I stood out in the rhododendrons  | marveling at Gemini and Cassiopeia , while her hope chest was fast going up the chimney . She might 've understood my predicament for what it was  --  an expression of love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will not complain about it . She is fine now , I think , in most ways . And if she is not as certain about things as she once was , that is not a tragedy , and I think she will be better as time goes on . By the time the copilot pokes his head through the tourist class curtain and gives us all the high sign , Vicki has drifted off to sleep , her head on a tiny pillow , her mouth slightly ajar . I intended to show her Lake Erie , which we 're now passing high above , green and shimmering , with gray Ontario out ahead . She is tired from too much anticipation , and I want her full of energy for our whirlwind trip . She can see the lake on the flight home , and be a slug-a-bed on Sunday night when we return from her parents . An odd thing happened to me last night , and I would like to say something about it because it touches on the whole business of full disclosure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , of course , what I was n't prepared to tell Vicki . For the past two years I have been a member of a small group in town which we got together and called  --  with admirable literalness  --  the Divorced Men 's Club . There are five of us in all , though the constituency has changed once or twice , since one fellow got married again and moved away from Haddam to Philadelphia , and another died of cancer . In both instances someone has come along at just the right time to fill in the space , and we have all been happy to have five since that number seems to strike a balance . There have been several times when I have nearly quit the club , if you can call it a club , since I do n't think of myself as a classic joiner and do n't feel , at least anymore , that I need the club 's support . In fact , almost all of it bores the crap out of me , and ever since I began to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over the shoals and headed back to the mainstream of my own lived life . But there have been good reasons to stay . I did not want to be the first to leave as a matter of choice . That seemed niggardly to me  --  gloating that  | I had " come through , " whereas maybe the others had n't , even though ( U ) one has ever admitted that we do anything to support one another . To start with , none of us is that kind of confessional , soulful type . We are all educated . One fellow is a hanker . One works in a local thinkr ( ank . One is a seminarian , and the last guy is a stocks analyst . Ours is much more a jocular towel-popping raffish-rogueishness than anything too serious . What we mostly do is head down to the August , puff cigars , talk in booming businessmen 's voices and yuk it up once a month . Or else we pile into Carter Knott 's old van and head down to a ball game in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get a special party deal at Ben Mouzakis ' Paramount Show Boat I ) ock . Though there 's another reason I do n't leave the club . And that is that none of the five of us is the type to be in a club for divorced men  --  none of us in fact even seems to belong in a place like Haddam  --  given our particular circumstances . And yet we are there each time , as full of dread and timidness as conscripts to a firing squad , doing what we can to be as chatty and polite as Rotarians  --  ending nights , wherever we are , talking about life and sports and business , hunched over our solemn knees , some holding red-ended cigarettes as the boat heads into the lighted dock , or before last call at the Press Box Bar on Walnut Street , all doing our best for each other and for non-confessional personal expression . Actually we hardly know each other and sometimes can barely keep the ball moving before a drink arrives . Likewise there have been times when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back . But given our characters , I believe this is the most in friendship any of us can hope for . ( X is dead right about me in this regard . ) In any case the suburbs are not a place where friendships flourish . And even though I can not say we like each other , I definitely can say that we do n't dislike each other , which may be exactly the quiddity of all friendships that have not begun with fellows you knew before your own life became known to you  --  which is the case with me , and , I suppose , for the others , though I truly do n't know them well enough to say . We met  --  the original five  --  because we 'd all signed up for the  | " Back in Action " courses at Haddam I ugh School , courses designed expressly for people like us , who did n't feel comfortable in service clubs . I was enrolled in " Twentieth-Century American Presidents and Their Foreign Policies . " A couple of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and we used to stand round the coffee urn on our breaks keeping our eyes diverted from the poor , sad , skinny divorced women who wanted to go home with us and start crying at 4 A.M. One thing led to another , and by the time our courses were half over we 'd started going over to the August , jawing about fishing trips to Alaska and baseball trades , singling out one another 's idiosyncracies , and assigning funny names for each other like " ole Knot-head " for Carter Knott , the banker ; " ole Basset Hound " for Frank Bascombe ; " ole Jay Jay " for Jay Pitcher ? who , inside of a year , died alone in his house with a brain tumor he never even knew about . Perfect Babbitts , really , all of us , even though to some extent we understood that . In a way , I suppose you could say all of us were and are lost , and know it , and we simply try to settle into our lost-ness as comfortably and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And perhaps the only reason we have not quit is that we ca n't think of a compelling reason to . When we do think of a good reason we 'll all no doubt quit in an instant . And I may be getting close . But that is not so much the point as a way of getting around to it . Yesterday was the day of our spring fishing excursion for flukes and weakfish , out of Brielle . Knot-head Knott made all the arrangements , and while Ben Mouzakis does not give us one of his boats all to ourselves for the money we pay , he usually just books one other party of congenial fellows for the afternoon and takes us out at cost since he knows we 'll talk it up in Haddam and come back ourselves next year , and because I honestly think he enjoys our company . We are all good fellows for an afternoon . I had left Haddam in the glum spirits I 've fallen into each year on the day before Ralph 's birthday . It had rained early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I had come round the traffic rotary in  | Neptune and turned toward the south Shore Points , the rain had swept up into the Amboys leaving me drenched in the supra-real seashore sunshine and traffic hum of Shark River , as indistinguishable from my fellow Jerseyites as a druggist from Sea Girt . It is of course an anonymity I desire . And New Jersey has plenty to spare . A passing glance down off the bridge-lock at Avon and along the day-trip docks where the plastic pennants flutter and shore breezes dance always assures me that any one of these burly Bermudashorts fellows waiting impatiently with their burly wives for the Sea lox to weigh its anchor or the Jersey Lady to cast off , could just as well be me , heading out after monkfish off Mantoloking or Deauville . Such random identifications always strike me as good practice . Better to think that you 're like your fellow man than to think  --  like some professors I knew at Berkshire College  --  that no man could be you or take your place , which is crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , and to ridicule . Anyone could be anyone else in most ways . Face the facts . Though possibly because of my skittishness , yesterday the Bermuda-shorts guys on the docks did n't seem altogether hopeful from my distance . They seemed to be wandering off bandy-legged from their spouses down the dock planks , arms folded , faces querulous in the mealy sunshine , their natural Jersey pessimism working up a fear that the day might go wrong  --  in fact could n't go right . Someone would charge them too much for an unwanted and insignificant service ; the wife would get seasick and force the boat in early ; there 'd he no fish and the day would end with a sad chowder at a rueful chowder house a stone 's throw from home . In other words , all 's ahead to be regretted ; better to start now . I could 've yelled right out to them : Cheer up ! Chances are better than you think . Things could pan out . You could have a whale of a time , so climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . But as it happened , I would not have been more right . Ben Mouzakis had chartered half the boat to a family of Greeks  --  the Spanelises  --  from his own home village near Parga on the Ionian , and the divorced men were all on best behavior , acting like'good-will  | ambassadors on a fortunate posting , assisting the women with their stubby rods , baiting hooks with brown chub and untangling backlashed reels . The Greek men had their own way of fixing on bait so that it was harder to pick clean , and a good deal of time was spent learning this procedure . Ben Mouzakis eventually broke out some retsina , and by six o'clock fishing was over , the few fluke caught off the " secret reef ' were packed in ice , the radio was beamed into a Greek station in New Brunswick , and everyone  --  the divorced men and the Spanelises , two men , three pretty women and two children  --  were sitting inside the long gallery cabin , elbows on knees , nodding and cupping glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the value of the drachma , Melina Mercouri and the trip to Yosemite the Spanclises were planning for June if their money held out . I was contented with the way the day had turned out . Sometimes an awful sense of loss comes over me when I am with these men , as profound as a tropical low . Though it has been worse in the past than yesterday . Something about them  --  earnest , all good-hearted fellows  --  seems as dreamy to me as it 's possible to be , dreamier than I am by far . And dreamy people often do not mix well , no matter what you might believe . Dreamy people actually have little to offer one another , tend in fact to neutralize each other 's dreaminess into bleary nugatude . Misery does not want company  --  happiness does . Which is why I have learned to stay clear of other sportswriters when I 'm not working  --  avoid them like piranhas  --  since sportswriters are often the dreamiest people of all . It is another reason I will not stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys from the office at Wally 's , a popular Third Avenue watering hole , and the dreads come right down out of the fake tin ceiling and the Tiffany hanging lamps like cyanide . My knee starts to hop under the table , and in three minutes I 'm emptied of all conviction and struck dumb as a shoe and want nothing but to sit and stare away at the pictures on the wall , or at how the moldings fit the ceiling or how the mirrors in the back bar reflect a different room from the one I 'm in , and fantasize about how much I 'm going to enjoy my  | trip home . A group of sportswriters together can narrow your view tar beyond pessimism , since the worst of them tend to be cynics looking only for false drama in the germs of human defeat . Beyond that , what is it that makes me back off from even the best like-minded small talk when there is no chance of the willies nor the least taint of cynicism , and when in principle at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I go fishing with the Divorced Men ) ? Simply , that I hate for things to get finally pinned down , for possibilities to be narrowed by the shabby impingement of facts  --  even the simple fact of comradeship . I am always hoping for a great surprise to open in what has always been a possible place for it  --  comradeship among professionals ; friendship among peers ; passion and romance . Only when the facts are made clear , 1 ca n't bear it , and run away as fast as I can  --  to Vicki , or to sitting up all night in the breakfast nook gazing at catalogs or to writing a good sports story or to some woman in a far-off city whom I know I 'll never see again . It 's exactly like when you were young and dreaming of your family 's vacation ; only when the trip was over , you were left faced with the empty husks of your dreams and the fear that that 's what life will mostly be  --  the husks of your dreams lying around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , is it . Even so , I have been happy enough on the Divorced Men 's fishing trips . My habit is not to rent a rod and reel but to walk around and exchange a wry word with the men who are fishing like demons , go get their beers , sit in the passengers ' cabin and watch television , or go up top and stand beside Ben and watch the sonar on the pilot 's deck , where he finds the fish like clouds of white metal on the dark green baize . Ben never remembers my name , though after a while he recognizes me as someone named John , and we have diverse conversations about the economy or Russian fishing vessels or base ball , which Ben is a fanatic for , and which serves as a good manto-man connection . On yesterday 's excursion I finished the day doing what I like best , standing at the iron rail near the bow of the Mantoloking Belle staring off at the jeweled shore lights of New Jersey , brightening as dark  | fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Columbus or a pilgrim seeing the continent of his dreams take shape in the dusk for the first time . My plans for the evening were to be at Vicki 's by eight , to surprise her with an intimate German dinner at Truegel 's Red Palace on the river at Lambertville  --  celebrating two months of love  --  then have her home early . Altogether it was not a bad bunch of prospects . Down the railing from me , staring as I was into the sequined gloom , was Walter Luckett , pensive as a judge and quite possibly cold in the spring night , from the way he was hunched over his elbows . Walter is the newest member of the Divorced Men . He took Rocko Ferguson 's place when Rocko got remarried and moved down to Philadelphia , and came in as an old acquaintance of Carter Knott 's from Harvard Business School . Walter is from Coshocton , Ohio , attended Grinnell , and pronounces Ohio as if it both begins and ends in a U. He is a special-industries analyst for Dexter &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortoise-shell glasses and short , slicked hair . Occasionally I spy him on the train platform going to work , but we rarely speak . In fact I know almost nothing else about him . Carter Knott told me Walter 's wife , Yolanda , left him and ran off to Bimini with a water ski instructor ; that it 'd been a big shock , but he seemed to be " handling things better now . " That could happen to any of us , of course , and the Divorced Men seemed like just the thing for him . Occasionally , I 've slipped out to the Weirkeeper 's Tavern after eleven  --  I do this sometimes to see the sports final on the big screen ? and there was Walter , a little drunk and talkative . Once he yelled out , " Hey Frank ! Where 're all the women ? " after which I could n't wait to get out . Another time I was in The Coffee Spot at dinnertime when Walter came in . He sat down in the booth across from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of phonies he thought they all were , and about the quality of silk underwear you can get out of most catalogs . Some , he said , were made in Korea , but the best ones  | came right from China ; it was one of his industries . And then we just sat for a long time  --  a hundred years , it felt like  --  while our eyes tried to find a place to rest , until they finally settled on each other . And then we sat and stared at each other for four , maybe five horrible , horrible minutes , then Walter just got up and walked out without ordering anything or saying another word . Since then he has never mentioned that terrible moment , and I have frankly tried to duck him and on two occasions know that he walked in the door at the August , saw me and walked out again  --  something I respect him for . All together , I think I like Walter Luckett . He does not really belong in a divorced men 's club any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on for size , not because he thinks he 'll eventually like it , or that this is the thing he 's always missed , but because it 's in some ways the last thing in the world he can imagine doing , and probably feels he should do it for that reason alone . We should all know what 's at the end of our ropes and how it feels to be there . " Do you happen to know what I like about standing here at the rail and looking out at the coast , Frank ? " Walter said softly , after I had declined to speak a word . " What 's that , Walter ? " I was surprised he had even noticed me . Walter had caught one weakfish all afternoon , the biggest one caught , and after that he had quit fishing and curled up with a book on one of the bench seats . " I like seeing things from an angle you do n't live them . You know what I mean ? " " Sure , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Then I come just a mile off shore , and it 's dark , and suddenly it 's all different . Better . Right ? " Walter looks around at me . He is not a large man , and tonight he is wearing white walking shorts , a baggy blue tennis shirt and deck shoes , which makes him seem even smaller . " It seems better . Probably that 's why we come out here . " " Right , " Walter said , and stared for a time out at the darkly dazzling coast , the sound of water slapping the side of the boat . Far up I could see the glow of the Asbury Park ferris wheel , and due  | north the ice-box glow of Gotham . It was consoling to see those lights and know that lives were there , and mine was here . And for the moment I was glad to have come along , and considered the Divorced Men all pretty darn solid fellows . Most of them , in fact , were inside the main cabin yakking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not the way I always see it though , Frank , " Walter said soberly , clasping his hands over the rail and leaning on his forearms . " How do you usually see it , Walter ? " " Okay . It 's funny . When I was a kid in eastern Ohio , our whole family used to take these long trips . Fairly long , anyway . From Coshocton , in the east part of the state , all the way to Timewell , Illinois , which is in the west part of that state . All of it just flatland , you know . One county same with another one . And I used to ride in the car while my sister played hubcaps or lucky-lives-license or whatever , concentrating on remembering certain things  --  a house or maybe a silo or a swell of land , or just a bunch of pigs , something I 'd be able to remember on the way back . So it would be the same to me , all part of the same experience , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you do it ? " As Walter looked at me again , his glasses caught a glint of shore light and twinkled at me . " I guess I 'm your opposite here , Walter , " I said . " The highway never seems the same coming and going to me . I even think about meeting myself in the cars I pass . I actually forget it all pretty much right away , though I tend to forget a lot of things . " " That 's a better way to be , " Walter said . " To me , it makes the world more interesting . " " I guess I 'm having to learn that , Frank , " Walter said and shook his head . " Is something bothering you , Walter , " I said  --  and should n't have , since I broke the rules of the Divorced Men 's Club , which is that we 're none of us much interested in that kind of self-expression . " No , " Walter said moodily . " Nothing 's bothering me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the jet coast of Jersey  --  the boxy  | beach house lights linking us to whatever hopeful life was proceeding there . " Let me just ask you something , Frank , " Walter said . " All right . " " Who do you have to confide in ? " Walter did not look at me when he said this , though I somehow felt his smooth soft face was both sad and hopeful at the same moment . " I guess I do n't , to tell the truth , " I said . " I mean I do n't have anyone . " " Did you not even confide in your wife ? " " No , " I said . " We talked about things plenty of times . That 's for sure . Maybe we do n't mean the same thing by confiding . I 'm not particularly a private person . " " Good . That 's good , " Walter said . I could tell he was puzzled but also satisfied by my answer , and what 's more I had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see you later , " Walter said unexpectedly and gave me a pat on the arm , and walked off down the deck into the dark where one of the Spanelis men was still fishing , though it was black on the water and the tart spring air was chilling enough that I went inside and watched a couple of innings of a Yankees game on the boat 's TV . Once we got in , though , and all said our goodbyes , and the divorced men had given the few weakfish and fluke they 'd caught to the Spanelis kids , I was walking across the gravel lot to my car , ready to head straight for Vicki 's and steal her away to Lambertville , and here was Walter Luckett scuffing his deck shoes alongside my car and looking , in the dark , strangely like a man who wanted to borrow some money . " What-say now , Wally , " I said cheerfully , and went about putting the key in the door lock . I had an hour to get there , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when she does n't have to work the next day . She is damned serious about her nursing career , and likes being bright and cheerful , since she believes many of her patients have no one who understands their predicament . The result is I do n't drop in after eight , no matter what .  | " This is a helluva life , is n't it , Frank ? " Walter said and leaned against my back fender , arms folded , staring off as if in amusement as the other divorced men and the Spanelises were barging out of the lot up toward Route 35 , their lights brightly swaying . They were honking horns and yelling , and the Spanelis kids were squeal-ing " It sure is , Walter . " I opened my door and stopped to look at him in the dark . He stuffed his hands in his pockets and bunched his shoulders . He had on a pale sweater draped in the old lank , country club style . " I think it 's a pretty good life , though . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You certainly could n't . " " There 's so much you ca n't foresee , yet it 's all laid out and clear . " " You look cold , Walter . " " Let me buy you a drink , Frank . " " Ca n't tonight . Got things to do . " I smiled at him conspiratorially . " Just a bone warmer . We can sneak right over into the Manasquan . " Across the lot was the Manasquan Bar , a barny old hiproofed fisherman 's roadhouse with a red BAR sign on top . Ben Mouzakis had invested in it with his wife 's brother , Evangelis , as he told me once when we talked about tax shelters up on deck . " What d' ya say ? " Walter said and started off . " Let 's drink one , Frank . " I did not want to have a nightcap with Walter Luckett . I wanted to go speeding back toward Vicki and drowsy Lambertville while the last flickers of sunlight clung in the western sky . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose up in my I thoughts suddenly , and I almost jumped in the car and rammed out of the lot like a desperado . But I did n't . I stood and looked at Walter , who by now had walked halfway across the empty lot in his walking shorts and sweater , and had turned toward me and assumed a posture I can only describe as heartbreaking . And I could not say no . Walter and I had something in common  --  something insignificant , but something that his heartbreaking posture made undeniable . Walter and I were both men , Vicki or no Vicki , Lambertville or no Lambertville.  | Only one , " I said into the parking lot darkness . " I 've got a date . " " You 'll make it , " Walter said , lost now in the bleary seaside lowlights of Brielle . " I 'll see to that myself . " In the Manasquan Walter ordered a scotch and I ordered a gin , and for a while we sat in complete uncomfortable silence and stared at the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock . I thought I could detect Ben Mouzakis in several  --  a chesty young roughneck of the Fifties , a big immigrant 's crazy grin , no shirt , muscles bristling , standing beside some other taller men in khakis and two hundred dead fish strung along a rafter board . The Manasquan is a dark , pine-board , tar-smelling pile of sticks inside and in truth it is one of my favorite places for small departures . Any other time I would n't have minded being there one bit . It has a long teak bar with a quasi-nautical motif , and no one makes the first attempt to be friendly , though drinks are poured honestly and at a reasonable price for a touristy seaside area . Sometimes , arriving too early for our excursion , I have walked over , taken a seat at the bar and bought a good greasy hamburger and felt right at home reading a newspaper or watching TV alongside the few watchcap fishermen who huddle and mutter at the end of the bar , and the woman or two who float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you 'd be happy to consider yourself a regular , though when all is said and done you have nothing at all in common with anyone there except some speechless tenor of spirit only you know a damn thing about . " Frank , were you ever an athlete ? " Walter said forthrightly after our long and studious staring . " Just an athletic supporter , Walter , " I said and gave him a grin to set him at his ease . He obviously had something on his mind ; and the sooner he got it out , the sooner I could be blazing a trail west . Walter smiled back at me ironically , gave his nose a disapproving pinch , pushed up at his glasses . Walter , I realized , was actually a handsome man , and it made me like him . It is n't easy for handsome people to be themselves , or even try to be . And I had a feeling  | Walter was trying to be himself for the moment , and I liked him for that reason , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were out at Michiganis that right , " Walter asked . " Right . " " That 's Ann Arbor , not East Lansing . " " Right . " " I know that 's different . " Walter nodded thoughtfully and sniffed again . " You could n't be an athlete there , I comprehend that . That 's like a fact orY . " It was n't that bad . " " I was an athlete out at Grinnell . Anybody could be one . It was n't a big thing , although I 'm sure it 's gotten bigger now . I never go back anymore . " " I do n't go back to Ann Arbor , either . What 'd you do ? " " Wrestled . One forty-five . We wrestled against Carleton and Macalester and those places . I was n't very good . " " Those are good schools , though . " " They are good schools , " Walter said . " " Though you do n't hear much about them . I guess everybody wants to talk about sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes , " I said . " But I do n't mind it . Other people know a lot more about sports than I do , to tell you the truth . It 's a pretty innocent part of people , and talking has the effect of bringing us all together on a good level . " I do n't know why I started talking to Walter in this Grantland Rice after-dinner speech way , except that he seemed to want that and it was truthfully the only thing I could think of . ( It 's also true that I believe every word of it , and it 's a lot better than talking about some pretentious book that only one person 's read . ) Walter moved the . ice around in his drink using his finger . " What would you say 's the worst part about your job , Frank ? I hate traveling myself , and I have to do it . I bet that 's it , right ? " " I do n't mind it , " I said . " There 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without anymore . In particular , now that I 'm home alone . " " Okay , sure . " Walter drank down his scotch in one gulp and  | signaled for another in one continuous finger-wiggle gesture . " So it 's not the travel . Okay , that 's good . " " I think the hardest part about my job , Walter , since you asked , is that people expect me to make things better when I come . If I come to interview them or write about them or just call them up on the phone , they want to be enriched . I 'm not talking about money . Its just part of the natural illusion of my profession . The fact is , e can sometimes not make things worse , or we can make things 1 arse . But we ca n't usually make things better for individuals . Sometimes we can for groups . But then not always . " " Interesting . " Walter Luckett nodded as though it was anything but interesting . " What do you mean , worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by not being better . I do n't know if I ever thought about it before , " I said . " But I think it 's right . " " People do n't have any right to think you can make life better for them , " Walter said soberly . " But it 's what they want , all right . I agree . " " I do n't know about rights , " I said . " It 'd be nice if we could . I think I once thought I could . " " Not me , " Walter said . " One lousy marriage proved that . " " It 's a disappointment . I do n't mean marriage is a disappointment . Just ending it . " " I guess . " Walter looked down at the fishermen at the dim-lit end of the bar , where they were huddling over some playing cards with fat Evangelis . One of the men laughed out loud , then another man put the cards in his coat pocket and smirked , and the talk got quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cards and to have had a good laugh with the fishermen instead of being land-locked with Walter . " Your marriage was n't disappointing to you , then ? " Walter said in a way I found vaguely insulting . Walter had just the tips of his slender fingers touching the glass of scotch , and then he looked at me accusingly . " No . It was really a wonderful marriage . What I remember of it .  | " My wife 's in Bimini , " Walter said . " My ex-wife , I need to sa now . She went down there with a man named Eddie Pitcock , a man I 've never seen and know nothing about except his name , which I know from a private detective I hired . I could find out a lot more . But who cares ? Eddie Pitcock 's his name . Is n't that a name for the guy who runs away with your wife ? " " It 's just a name , Walter . " Walter pinched his nose again and sniffed . " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I want to talk about anyway , Frank . " " Let talk about sports , then . " Walter stared intently at the fish pictures behind the bar and breathed forcefully through his nose . " I feel pretty self-important hauling you over here like this , Frank . I 'm sorry . I 'm not usually self-important . I do n't want this to be the story of my life . " Walter had completely ignored my offer of a good sports conversation , which seemed to mean something more serious was on the way , something I was going to be sorry about . " It is n't a very amusing life . I 'm sure of that . " " I understand , " I said . " Maybe you just wanted to have a drink and sit in a bar with someone you knew but did n't have to confide in . That makes plenty of sense . I 've done that . " " Frank , I went in a bar in New York two nights ago , and I let a man pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  the Americana , as a matter of fact  --  and slept with him . " Walter stared furiously out into the fishing pictures . He stared so hard that I knew he would like nothing in the world better than to be one of those happy , proud khaki-clad fishermen displaying his fat stripers to the sun on a happy July day , say , in 1956 , when we would have been , Walter and me , eleven years old  --  assuming we are the same age . I would 've been doubly happy at the moment to be there myself . " Is that what you wanted to tell me , Walter ? " " Yes . " Walter Luckett said this as if stunned , looking deadly serious . " Well , " I said . " It does n't matter to me. "  | " I know that , " Walter said , his chin vaguely moving up and down in a kind of secret nod to himself . " I knew that ahead of time . Or I t hought I did . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Is n't it ? " " I feel pretty bad , Frank , " Walter said . " I do n't feel dirty or ashamed . Its not a scandal . I probably ought to feel stupid , but I do n't even Iccl that way . I just feel bad . It 's like it 's loosed a bad feeling in nu . " I ) o you think you want to do it again , Walter ? " " I doubt it . I hope not , anyway , " Walter said . " He was a nice guv , I 'll just say that . He was n't one of these leather bullies or what have you . And neither am I. He 's got a wife and kids up in north Jersey . Passaic County . I 'll probably never see him again . And I 'll never do that again , I hope . Though I could , I guess . I certainly do n't think anyone would care if I did . You know ? " Walter drank down his scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were talking loud enough for the fishermen to hear us . They would probably have something to say about Walter 's experience if we wanted to include them . " Why do you think you told me , Walter ? " " I think I wanted to tell you , Frank , because I knew you would n't care . I felt like I knew the kind of guy you are . And if you did care , 1 could feel better because I 'd know I was better than you . I have some real admiration for you , Frank . I got your book out of the library when I joined the group , though I admit I have n't read it . But I felt like you were a guy who did n't hold opinions . " " I 've got a lot of opinions , " I said . " But I tend to keep them to myself , usually . " " I know that . But not about something like this . Am I right ? " " It does n't matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll only know about it later . " " I 'd be happy if you would n't tell me about it then , frankly , if you do . I do n't think it would do me any good . I do n't really think of this as a confession , Frank , because I do n't really want a response from you . And I know you do n't like confessions . "  | " No , I do n't , " I said . " I think most things are better if you just let them be lonely facts . " " I agree , " Walter said confidently . " You did tell me , though , Walter . " " Frank , I needed a context . I think that 's what friends are for . " Walter jiggled ice in his glass in a summary fashion , like a conventioneer . " I do n't know , " I said . " Women are better at this kind of thing , I think , " Walter said . " I never thought about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time and do n't really bother with it . I believe Yolanda did . They understand friendship better in the long run . " " Do you think you and this fellow , whatever his name is , are friends ? " " Probably not , Frank . No . But you and I are . I can say that I do n't have a better friend in the world than you are right now . " " Well that 's good , Walter . Do you feel better ? " Walter thumped the space between his brown eyes with his middle finger and let go a deep breath . " No . No . No , I do n't . I did n't even think I would , to tell you the truth . I do n't think I told you to feel better . Like I said , I did n't want anything back . I just did n't want it to be my secret . I do n't like secrets . " " So , how do you feel ? " " About what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man . What else have we been talking about ? " I darted a look down the long bar . One of the fishermen was sitting staring at us , apart from the others who were watching a TV above the cash register , watching the Yankees game . The fisherman looked drunk , and I suspected he was n't really listening to what we were saying , though that was no sign he could n't hear it by accident . " Or about telling me . I do n't know , " I said almost in a whisper . " Either one . " " Have you ever been poor , Frank ? " Walter glanced at the fisherman , then back at me.  | " No . Not really . " " Me , too . Or me either . I have n't been . But that 's exactly how I fret now . Like I 'm impoverished , just suddenly . Not that I want anything . Not that I even can lose anything . I just feel bad , though I 'm probably not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what being poor 's like ? Feeling bad ? " " Maybe , " Walter said . " It 's my version anyway . Maybe you 've got a better one . " " No . Not really . That 's fine . " " Maybe we all need to he poor , Frank . Just once . Just to earn the right to live . " " Maybe so , Walter . I hope not . I would n't like it much . " " But do n't you feel sometimes , Frank , like you 're living way up on the top of life , and not really living all of it , all the way down deep ? " " No . I never felt that way , Walter . I just always felt like I was living all the life I could . " " Well , then you 're lucky , " Walter Luckett said bluntly . He tapped his glass on the bar . Evangelis looked around , but Walter waved him off . He let a couple of ice cubes wiggle around in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you pal ? " He tried to smile around the ice cubes and looked stupid . " I did , anyway . " " Oh , you 'll be fine , " Walter said . He laid a crisp five-dollar bill out on the bar . He probably had plenty of such bills in his pocket . I le adjusted his sweater around his shoulders . " Let 's take a walk , Frank . " We walked out of the bar , past the fishermen and Evangelis , standing under the TV looking up at the color screen and the game . The fishermen who 'd been staring at us still sat staring at the space where we 'd been . " Come back , fellas , " Evangelis said , smiling , though we were already out the door . Awash down the boat channel and the dark Manasquan River , the night air was fresher than I could 've imagined it , a cool , afterrain airishness , an evening to soothe away human troubles . Over  | the water , halyards were belling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Lighted condos rose above the far river bank . " Tell me something , would you . " Walter took a deep breath and let it out . Two young black men holding their own gear and plastic bait-buckets were loitering on the gangplank of the Mantoloking Belle , ready for an all-night adventure . Ben Mouzakis stood in his pilot 's house staring down at them from the dark . " If I can . " I said . Walter seemed to be feeling better in spite of himself . " Why 'd you quit writing ? " " Oh that 's a long story , Walter . " I crammed my hands in my pockets and weasled away a step or two toward my car . " I guess so , I guess so . Sure . They 're all long stories , are n't they ? " " I 'll tell you sometime , since we 're friends , Walter . But not right now . " " Frank , I 'd like that . I really would . Sit down over a drink and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't we ? " " Mine 's a pretty simple one . " " Well , good . I like ' em simple . " " Take care , Walter . You 'll feel better tomorrow . " " You take care , Frank . " Walter started toward his car at the far end of the gravel lot , though when he was twenty yards from me he started running for some reason , and ran until I could n't see him anymore , only his white shorts and his thin legs fading in the night . Central Jersey dozed in a sweet spring somnolence . DJ 's as far south as Tom 's River crooned along the seaboard that it was after eight . Nighttime streets were clearing from Bangor to Cape Canaveral , and I was out of luck with Vicki , though I tried to make good time . At Freehold I stopped for the hell of it and called her apartment where no one answered ; she unplugged the phone after bedtime . I called the nurses ' private hospital number  --  a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones in case of emergency ; the  | regular hospital number with the last digit changed to zero . A woman answered in a startled voice and said her records showed Miss Arcenault was n't scheduled . Was it an emergency ? No . Thanks , I said . For some reason I called my house . The answering machine clicked on with my voice , cheerier than I could bear to hear myself . I beeped lirr a message and there was X 's managerial-professional voice saying she would meet me the next morning . I hung up before she was finished . Once , when our basset hound , Mr. Toby , was killed by a car that did n't bother to stop  --  right on I loving Road  --  X , in tears , said she wished that time could just be snatched back . Precious seconds and deeds retrieved for a better try at things . And I thought , while I dug the grave behind the forsythias along the cemetery fence , that it was like a woman to grieve over a simple fact in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recognizing what was bad or peculiar in life , admitting it has to stay that way , and going ahead with the best of things . Only that 's exactly what I craved now ! A precious hour returned to me ; a part of Walter 's sad disclosures held over till a later date  --  hardly the best of things . What 's friendship 's realest measure ? I 'll tell you . The amount of precious time you 'll squander on someone else 's calamities and fuck-ups . And as a consequence , zipping along the Jersey darkside past practical I lightstown , feeling ornery as a bunkhouse cook , the baddies suddenly swarmed my car like a charnel mist so dense that not even opening the window would rout them . Nothing in the world is as hopeful as knowing a woman you like is somewhere thinking about only you . Conversely , there is no badness anywhere as acute as the badness of no woman out in the world thinking about you . Or worse . That one has quit because of some bone-headedness on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding the earth has disappeared . No loneliness can compete with that . And New Jersey , muted and adaptable , is the perfect landscape for that very loneliness , its other pleasures notwithstanding . Michigan comes close , with its long , sad vistas , its  | desolate sunsets over squatty frame houses , second-growth forests , flat interstates and dog-eared towns like Dowagiac and Munising . But only close . New Jersey 's is the purest loneliness of all . By disclosing an intimacy he absolutely did n't have to disclose ( he did n't want advice , after all ) , Walter Luckett was guilty of both spoiling my superb anticipation and illuminating a set of facts-oflife I 'd have been happy never to know about . There are things in this world  --  plenty of them  --  we do n't need to know the facts about . The noisome fact of two men 's snugglebuggle in some Seventh Avenue drummer 's hotel has no mystery to it  --  the way , say , an electric guitar or " the twist " or an old Studebaker have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever could live together twenty years , sell antiques , change to real estate , adopt a Korean child , change their wills , buy a summer house on Vinalhaven , fall out of love a dozen times and back again , go back to women more than once and finally find love together as senior citizens . And still not have it . By now it seemed more than possible that Vicki had gotten bored and hied off with some oncologist from upstairs , in his dream machine Jag , and at that moment was whirling into the sunset , a thermos of mai tais on the console and Englebert Humperdinck groaning on the eight-track . What , then , was left for me to do but make the best of things . I drove to Route 1 , then south to Mrs. Miller 's little brick ranchette on a long , grassy lot between an Exxon and a Rusty Jones , where a chiropractor once kept a practice . Several older , low-slung bomber cars were in the driveway , and the lights were lit behind drawn curtains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late here , too , though the curtained lights certainly spoke of some secret , possibly exotic goings on inside ; enough to excite my curiosity , and in fact enough to excite the curiosity of anyone driving south through the night toward Philadelphia with only glum prospects to consider . Mrs. Miller and I have done business two years now , since just before X and I got divorced , and I 've become a well-known face to all the aunts and uncles and cousins who lounge around inside in  | the tiny , overfurnished rooms , talking in secret , low voices and drinking coffee at all hours of the day and night . They were probably , I. guessed , doing exactly that and no more now , and in fact if I had walked in I 'd have been as welcome as a cousin to have an after-hours consultation , inquire about my prospects for the rest of the week . But I preferred to respect her privacy , since , like a writer , her place of business is also her home . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driving down Route 1 heading for the hardware store with Clary and Paul in the back seat  --  we were intent on buying a bicycle pump  --  and I simply saw her open-palm Reader-Adviser sign and pulled in . Probably I had passed it two hundred times over the years , and never noticed . I do n't remember feeling out of sorts , though it 's not always possible to remember . But I believe when it comes time to see a reader-adviser you know it , if , that is , you are n't at full-scale war with your best instincts . For a moment I paused at the end of the driveway . I cut my lights and sat a moment watching the windows , since Mrs. Miller , her house , her business , her relatives , her life , posed altogether a small but genuine source of pleasure and wonder . It was as much for that reason that I went to see her once a week , and so found it satisfying enough last night just to be there . Mrs. Miller 's advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice and frequently completely wrong : " I see you are coming into much money soon " ( not true ) . " I see a long life " ( not likely , though I would n't argue ) . " You are a good man at heart " ( uncertain ) . And she gives me the same or similar advice almost every week , with provisory adjustments that have to do mostly with the weather : " Things will brighten for you " ( on rainy days ) . " Your future is not completely clear " ( on cloudy days ) . There are even days she does n't recognize me and gives me a puzzled look when I enter . " Though she giggles like a schoolgirl when we 're finished and says " See you next time " ( never using my name ) , and occasionally dispenses with giving me one of her cards , which has typed at the bottom , below the raised crystal ball emblem : A PLACE TO BRING did  | YOUR FRIENDS AND FEEL NO EMBARRASSMENT  --  I AM NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , you can bet on that . Since for five dollars she will lead you into a dimly lit back bedroom of her sturdy suburban house , where there is plastic-brocade drapery over the window . ( I wondered , first time through , if a little Levantine cousin or sister would n't be waiting there . But no . ) There the light is greenish-amber , and a tiny radio plays softly sinuous Greek-sounding flute music . There is an actual clouded crystal ball on the card table ( she has never used this ) and several stacks of oversized tarot cards . Once we 're in place she will hold my hand , trace its tender lines , wrinkle her brows as if my palm revealed hard matters , look puzzled or relieved and finally say hopeful , thoughtful things that no other strangers would ever think to say to me . She is the stranger who takes your life seriously , the personage we all go into each day in hopes of meeting , the friend to the great mass of us not at odds with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the strictest sense . She herself is a handsome , dusky-skinned woman in her thirties or forties , a bit overweight and vaguely condescending , but completely agreeable down deep  --  so much so that at the end of our conferences she will almost always entertain a question or two as a bonus . I write these questions on scraps of paper during the week , though I almost always lose them and end up asking simple , factualessential questions like : " Will Paul and Clarissa be safe from harm this week ? " ( a continued source of concern for anyone , especially me ) . Her answers , in turn , tend always to the bright side concerning my happiness , though toward the precautionary concerning my children : " No harm will come to them if you are a good father . " ( 1 have told her about Ralph long ago . ) Once , in a panic for a good question , I asked if the Tigers could possibly finish tied for the American League East , in which case a one-game , winner-take-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this made her angry . Betting advice , she said , was more expensive than five dollars , and then charged me ten without giving me an answer . I have learned over time that when her answers to my questions  | have been wrong , the best thing to think is that somehow it 's my fault things did n't turn out . But where else can you get , on demand , hopeful , inspiring projections for the real future ? Where else , on a windy day in January , can you drive out beset by blue devils and in five minutes be semireliably assured by a relative stranger that you are who you think you are , and that things are n't going to turn out so crappy after all ? Would a Doctor Freud be so obliging , I 've wondered ? Would he be any more likely to know anything , and tell you ? I doubt it . In fact , in the had days after my divorce I met a girl in St. Louis who had by then  --  she was in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hours consulting the most highly respected psychiatrist in that shadowy bricktop town , until one day she bounced into the office , full of high spirits . " Oh , Dr. Fasnacht , " she proclaimed , " I woke up this morning and realized I 'm cured ! I 'm ready to stop my visits and go out into the world on my own as a full-fledged citizen . You 've cured me . You 've made me so happy ! " To which the old swindler replied : " Why , this is disastrous news . Your wish to end your therapy is the most distressing evidence of your terrible need to continue . You are much more ill than I ever thought . Now lie down . " Mrs. Miller would never give anyone such mopish opinions . Her strategy would be to give a much more promising than usual reading for that day , shake your hand , ( possibly ) forgo the five dollars as a lucky sign and say with eyebrows raised , " Come back when things puzzle you . " Her philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get few enough of them in a lifetime . Go and enjoy it . And that is only the literal part of Mrs. Miller 's  --  what can I call it best ? Her service ? Treatment ? Poor words for mystery . Since for me , mystery is the crucial part , and in fact the only thing I find to have value at this stage in my life  --  midway around the track . Mystery is the attractive condition a thing ( an object , an action , a person ) possesses which you know a little about but do n't know about completely . It is the twiney promise of unknown things ( effects , interworkings , suspicions ) which you must be wise enough to  | explore not too deeply , for fear you will dead-end in nothing but facts . A typical mystery would be traveling to Cleveland , a town you have never liked , meeting a beautiful girl , going for a lobster dinner during which you talk about an island off of Maine where you have both been with former lovers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much you run upstairs and woggle the bejesus out of each other . Next morning all is well . You fly off to another city , forget about the girl . But you also feel differently about Cleveland for the rest of your life , but ca n't exactly remember why . Mrs. Miller , when I come to her for a five-dollar consultation , does not disclose the world to me , nor my future in it . She merely encourages and assures me about it , admits me briefly to the mystery that surrounds her own life , which then sends me home with high hopes , aswarm with curiosities and wonder on the very lowest level : Who is this Mrs. Miller if she is not a Gypsy ? A Jew ? A Moroccan ? Is " Miller " her real name ? Who are those other people insiderelatives ? Husbands ? Are they citizens of this state ? What enterprise are they up to ? Are guns for sale ? Passports ? Foreign currency ? On a slightly higher level : How do I seem ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) Though 1 am fierce to find out not one fleck more than is incidental to my visitis , since finding out more would only make me the loser , submerge me in dull facts , and require me to seek some other mystery or do without . As I expected would happen , simply proximity to the glow through her warm curtains  --  like the antique light of another century  --  plucked my spirits up like a hitchhiker who catches a ride when all hope was lost . More seemed suddenly possible , and near , whereas before nothing did . Though as I glanced back nostalgically at Mrs. Miller 's squared ranchette , I sensed the front door had opened an inch . Someone there was watching me , wondering who I was , what I 'd been up to . A love car ? The police ? A drunk sleeping it off ? I was not even sure the door had opened , so that this was as much a riddle to me as I was to whomever I took to be there . A shared riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take in the spirit of a marriage . And I slid off quickly into the south-bound traffic as renewed as a baby born to middle life . I took the first jug-handle turn and zipped back up the Great Woods Road through the dark apple orchards , sod farms , beefalo barns , the playing fields of De Tocqueville Academy and the modern world-headquarters lawns , all of which keep Haddam sheltered from the dazzling hubcap emporia , dairy barns and swank Radio Shack hurdy-gurdy down Route 1 toward the sullen city of brotherly love . I was not ready for bed now . Far from it . Factuality and loneliness had been put in their places , and an anticipation awakened . The day , changed to a spring evening , held promise only an adventure would unearth . I idled down Seminary Street , abstracted and empty in the lemony vapor of suburban eventide . ( It could always be a sad town . ) The two stoplights at either end were flashing yellow , and on the south side of the square only Officer Carnevale waited in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch speeders and fleeing ten-speed thieves . Even the seminary was silent  --  Gothic solemnity and canary lights from the quarreled windows aglimmer through the elms and buttonwoods . Sermonizing midterms were soon , and everybody 'd buckled down . Only Carnevale 's exhaust said a towny soul was breathing inside a hundred miles , where above the trees the gladlights of New York City paled the sky . Nine o'clock on the Thursday before Easter far down the suburban train line . A town , almost any town , would seem to have secrets all its own . Though if you believed that you 'd be wrong . I laddam in fact is as straightforward and plumb-literal as a fire hydrant , which more than anything else makes it the pleasant place it is . None of us could stand it if every place were a grizzled Chicago or a bilgy Los Angeles  --  towns , like Gotham , of genuine woven intricacy . We all need our simple , unambiguous , even factitious townscapes like mine . Places without challenge or double-ranked complexity . Give me a little Anyplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck , with stable property values , regular garbage pick-up , good drainage , ample parking , located not far from a major airport , and I 'll beat the birds up singing every morning . I slowed to take a peek at the marquee of the First Presbyterian , at the edge of the seminary grounds . I occasionally pop in on a given Sunday just to see what they 're up to and lift my spirits with a hymn . X and I attended when we first moved here , but she eventually lost interest , and I began working Sundays . Years ago , when I was a senior and in need of an antidote to the puddling , laughless , guilty ironies of midwar Ann Arbor , I began attending a liberal and nondogmatic Westminster group on Maynard Street . The preacher , who referred to himself as a " moderator , " was a tall , acned , opencollared scarecrow who aimed his mumbled sermons toward world starvation , the UN and SEATO , and who seemed embarrassed when it came time to stand up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny little anorexic wife was his assistant  --  they were both from Muskegon  --  and our congregation consisted mostly of elderly professors ' widows , a few confused and homely coeds and a homosexual or two just coming to grips with things . I lasted five weeks , then put my Bible away and started staying up Saturday nights at the fraternity and getting good and drunk . Christianity , like everything else in the Ann Arbor of those times , was too factual and problem-solving-oriented . The spirit was made flesh too matter-of-factly . Small-scale rapture and ecstasy ( what I 'd come for ) were out of the question given the mess the world was in . Consequently I loathed going . But the First Presbyterians of Haddam offer a good , safeand-sound approach to things . Their ardent hope is to bring you down to earth by causing your spirit to lift  --  a kind of complex spiritual orienteering . The regulars all have no doubts about what they 're there for ; they 're there to be saved or give a damned good impression of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . What I could read off the marquee , however , seemed strange business , though it will probably turn out to be as ordinary as toast ?  | a trick to lure the once-a-year guys into thinking church has changed . " The Race To The Tomb " The preacher will have some witty , eyebrow-arching joke to start off : " Now this fella , Jesus , he was really some heckuva peculiar kind of guy , would n't you say so ? " And we all would . Then straight away we 'd get to the hard-nosed corroborating of the resurrection and suggesting how such a fate might be ours . I slipped on by , gave Officer Carnevale the lucky thumbs-up , which he managed moodily to return , then drove straight over to The Presidents  --  up Tyler , down Pierce and winding a sinewy way to Cleveland Street , before stopping under a giant tupelo across from 116 , X 's little white clapboard colonial . Her Citation sat in the narrow drive , an unknown blue car parked at the curb . Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , crouched and laid my hand on the hood of the unknown blue car  --  a Thunderbird  --  then stole back to mine before anyone on Cleveland Street could see . As I had hoped , the Bird was as cold as a murderer 's heart , and I was relieved to believe it belonged to a neighbor , or to some relative visiting the Armentis next door . Though it could 've been a suitor I knew nothing about  --  one of the fat-belly credit card boys from the country club , a thought which changed relief back to doubt . My plan had been to pay an innocent visit . I had n't seen Paul and Clarissa in four days , a long interval in the normal course of our lives . The two of them usually waltz by after school , eat a sandwich , sit and chat together , rummage around their former rooms the way they used to , play Yahtzee or Clue , read books , all while I try by fervent misdirection to prove a continuity in their little lives with my presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clump upstairs to tease and flirt with them , answer their questions , challenge them and try to woo them back to me in some plain and forthright way , a strategy they 're wise to but do n't mind because they love me , know I love them , and have no choice , really . We are , all four of us in this , a solid and divided family , doing our level bests to see our duty clearly . Last night I hoped to stay for a drink , see the kids to bed , yak  | with X for half an hour , then end up , possibly , spending the night on the couch , something I had n't done in some time ( not , in fact , since I met Vicki ) but felt a fierce urge to do suddenly . Still if I 'd gone hat-in-hand up to the door , on a mission of somber fatherhood , I could n't be sure I would n't have interrupted an intime  --  the kids away on overnights at the Armentis , the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of neighbors interested in seeing a proud woman make the best of a fractured life . I would 've been thunderstruck to intercept some well-dressed corporate-level type with love in his eyes , athwart the precise couch I hoped to curl up on . X would 've been in her rights to say I 'd torpedoed her attempts at getting her feet on the ground , and the fellow would 've been in his rights to run me out or punch me . And we 'd have both ended up having to leave ( the two men always have to trudge off into the night alone , though occasionally they become friends if they meet up later in a bar ) . My whole scenario , in short , had lost its glow , and I was left in the dark understory , facing the blue intruder car with nothing to do more than breathe the plush air and endorse X 's neighborhood . The Presidents , with their precise fifty-foot frontages , their mature mulberries and straight sidewalks , are actually an excellent location for a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent bent , to dig her heels in . Up and down the street are other young free-thinking people on the way someplace in the world , sharp-eyed , idealistic folks who spotted a good investment and acted fast , and now have some value to sit on . The immigrant Italians who built them ( some chosen right out of Sears catalogs ) now prefer Delray Beach and Fort Myers and citizens ' groups more their own age , and have left their neighborhoods to the young , though hardly ever their own young , who prefer the likes of Pheasant Run and Kendall Park . The banks have proved compassionate with mortgage points and variable rates , and as a result the young liberals  --  most of them prospering stockbrokers , corporate speech writers , and public  | defenders  --  have revived a proud , close-knit neighborhood and property-value ethic where everybody looks after everybody else 's kids and grinds their own espresso . Bright new facades and paint jobs . New footings dug . A reshingled weather stoop . Smart art-deco numerals and a pane of discreetly stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . X , I think , is happy here . My children are close to their school , their friends and me . It is not the same as Hoving Road where we all once hung our hats , but things change in ways none of us can expect , no matter how damn much we know or how smart and goodintentioned each of us is or thinks he is . Who 'd know that Ralph would die ? Who 'd know that certainty would grow rare as diamonds ? Who 'd know our home would be broken into and everything suddenly break apart ? Did Walter Luckett know he 'd meet Mr. Wrong two nights ago and alter his life again after his wife already had ? No , you bet not . None of our lives is really ordinary ; nothing humdrum in our delights or our disasters . Everything is as problematic as geometry when it 's affairs of the heart in question . A life can simply change the way a day changes  --  sunny to rain , like the song says . But it can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded ten , and something began happening at 116 Cleveland . The yellow stoop light flashed on . Someone inside spoke in a tone of patient instruction , and the front door opened . My son , Paul , stepped out . Paul in tennis shorts , and a Minnesota Twins shirt I brought him from a trip I took . He is ten , small and not overly clever yet , a serious , distractable boy with a good heart , and all the sweet qualities of second sons : patience , curiosity , some useful inventiveness , sentimentality , a building vocabulary , even though he is not much of a reader . I have tried to think that things will turn out well for him , though when we powwow up in his room , a place he keeps furnished with Sierra Club posters of eagles and large Audubon mergansers and grebes , he always seems to display a moody enthrallment , as if  | there is some sovereign event in his life he senses is important but can not for some reason remember . Naturally I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They both carry on like soldiers . Paul had brought outside with him one of the birds from his dovecote . A mottled rock dove , a handsome winger . He toted it manfully to the curb , using the two-handed professional bird handler 's way he 's taught himself . I surveilled him like a spy , slumped behind the steering wheel , the shadow of the big tupelo making me not especially noticeable , though Paul was too intent on his own business to see me . At the curb he took the pigeon in one small hand , slipped the hood and neatly pocketed it . The bird cocked its head peckishly at his new surroundings . The sight , though , of Paul 's familiar , serious face calmed it . Paul studied the pigeon for a time , grappling it once again in both hands , and via the still darkness I could hear his boy 's voice talking . He was coaching the bird in some language he had practiced . " Remember this house . " " Fly this special route . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Think of all we 've worked on . " " Remember who your friends are " ? all of it good advice . When he 'd finished , he held the bird to his nose and sniffed behind its beaky head . I saw him close his eyes , and then it was up , pitched , the bird 's large bright wings seizing the night instantly , up and gone and out of sight like a thought , its wings white and then quickly small as it cleared the closure of trees  --  gone . Paul looked up a moment , watching it . Then , as if he 'd forgotten all about any loosed bird , he turned and stared at me across the street , slouched like Officer Carnevale in my cruiser car . He had seen me probably for quite some time , but had gone on with his business like a big boy who knows he 's watched and does n't care for it , but understands those are the rules . Paul walked across the street in his little boy 's ungainly gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , 1 know , to a total stranger . " Hi Dad , " he said through the window .  | " Eli , Paul . " " So what 's up ? " He still smiled at me like an innocent boy . " Just sort of sitting here now . " " Is it all right ? " " It 's great . Whose car 's that out front there ? " Paul looked hack behind him at the Thunderbird . " The Litzes . " ( Neighbor , lawyer , no problem . ) " Are you coming inside ? " " I just wanted to check up on you folks . Just being a patrol car . " " Clary 's asleep . Mom 's watching news , " Paul said , adopting his mother 's way of dropping definite articles , a midwest mannerism. 7hey went to market . She has flu . We bought tickets . " Who was that you gave his freedom to ? " " Ole Vassar . " Paul looked up the street . Paul names his birds after hillbilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Lee ? and had adopted his father 's partiality for ole as a term of pure endearment . I could 've hauled him through the window and hugged him till we both cried out , so much did I love him at that moment . " I did n't give him his freedom right off , though . " " Old Vassar has a mission first , then ? " " Yes sir , " Paul said and looked down at the pavement . It was clear I was burdening his privacy , of which he has plenty . But I knew he felt he had to talk about Vassar now . " What 's Vassar 's mission ? " I asked bravely . " To sec Ralph . " " Ralph . What 's he going to see Ralph for ? " Paul sighed a small boy 's put-on sigh , transformed back from a big boy . " To see if he 's all right . And tell him about us . " " You mean it 's a report . " " Yeah . I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us ? " " Yeah . " " And how did it come out ? " " Good . " Paul avoided my eyes in another direction . " My part okay , too ? "  | " Your part was n't too long . But it was good . " " That 's all right . Just so I made it in . When 's Ole Vassar reporting back ? " " He is n't . I told him he could live in Cape May . " " Why is that ? " " Because Ralph 's dead . I think . " I had taken him and his sister to Cape May only last fall , and I was interested now that he supposed the dead lived there . " It 's a one-way mission , then . " " Right . " Paul stared fiercely at the door of my car and not at me , and I could sense he was confused by all this talk of dead people . Kids are most at home with sincerity and the living ( who could blame them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an unironical bone in their bodies , even for things that are precisely in front of them and can threaten their existence . Paul 's and mine , though , has always been a friendship founded on sincerity 's rock . " What do you know tonight to tickle me ? " I said . Paul is a secret cataloger of corny jokes and can make anyone laugh out loud , even at a joke they 've heard before , though he often chooses to withhold . I myself envy his memory . For this question , though , he had to consider . He wagged his head backwards in pretend-thought , and stared into the tree boughs as if all the good jokes were up there . ( What did I say about things always changing and surprising us ? Who would 've thought a drive down a dark street could produce a conversation with my own son ! One in which I find out he 's in contact with his dead brother  --  a promising psychological indicator , though a bit unnerving  --  plus get to hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Paul said . He was all Johnny now . By the way he stuffed his hands in his pockets and averted his mouth I could tell he thought it was a pretty funny one . " Ready ? " I said . With anyone else this would spoil the joke . But with Paul it is protocol . " Ready , " he said . " Who speaks Irish and lives in your back yard ? "  | " I do n't know . " I give in straight away . " Paddy O'Furniture . " Paul could not hold back his laughter a second and neither could I. We both held our sides  --  he in the street , I in my car . We laughed like monkeys loud and long until tears rose in his eyes and mine , and I knew if we did not rein ourselves in , his mother would be out wondering ( silently ) about my " judgment . " Ethnics , though , are among our favorite joke topics . " That 's a prize-winner , " I said , wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , too . A better one , " he said , grinning and 4 trying not to grin at the same time . " I have to drive home now , sonny , " I said . " You 'll have to remember it for me . " " Are n't you coming inside ? " Paul 's little eyes met mine . " You can sleep on the couch . " " Not tonight , " I said , joy bounding in my heart for this sweet Uncle Milty . I would 've accepted his invitation if I could , taken him up and tickled his ribs and put him in his bed . " Rain Czech . " ( One of our oldest standbys . ) " Can I tell Mom ? " He had sprung past the strange confusion of my not coming inside , and on to the next most important issue : disclosure , the reporting of what had happened . In this he is not at all like his father , but he may come to it in time . " Say I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a conversation like old-timers . " " Even though it is n't true ? " " Even though it is n't true . " Paul looked at me curiously . It was not the lie I had instructed him to tell  --  which he might or might not tell , depending on his own ethical considerations  --  but something else that had occurred to him . " How long do you think it 'll take Ole Vassar to find Ralph ? " he said very seriously . " He 's probably almost there now . " Paul 's face went somber as a churchman 's . " I would n't like it to take forever , " he said . " That 'd be too long . "  | " Goodnight , son , " I said , suddenly full of anticipation of quite another kind . I started my motor . " Goodnight , Dad . " He broke a smile for me . " Happy dreams . " " You have happy dreams your own self .

Paul Anka sings tonight at Cobo Hall , a flashing billboard tells us . All the hotels are palaces , all the residents our best friends . Even Negroes look different here ? healthy , smiling , prosperous , expensive-suited , going places with briefcases . Our fellow passengers are all meeting people , it turns out , and are not resident Michiganders at all , though they all have come from here originally , and their relatives are their mirror-image : the women ash-blond , hippy , smiling ; the men blow-dried and silent-mouthed , secretive , wearing modern versions of old-time car coats and Tyroleans , earnest beefsteak handshakes extended .

Here is a great place to be in love ; to get a land-grant education ; to own a mortgage ; to see a game under the lights as the old dusky daylight falls to blue-black , a backdrop of stars and stony buildings , while friendly Negroes and Polacks roll their pants legs up , sit side by side , feeling the cool Canadian breeze off the lake . So much that is explicable in American life is made in Detroit . And I could be a perfect native if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , join the Michigan alums and buy a new car every year right at the factory door . Nothing would suit me better in middle life than to set up in a little cedar-shake builder's-design in Royal Oak or Dearborn and have a try at another Michigan girl ( or possibly even the same one , since we would have all that readymade to build on ) . My magazine could install me as the midwest office . It might even spark me to try my hand at something more adventurous  --  a guiding service to the northern lakes , for example . A change to pleasant surroundings is always a tonic for creativity .  | " It 's just like it 's still winter here . " Vicki 's nose is to the bus 's tinted window . We have passed the big tire miles back . She peered 11 at it silently as we drifted by , a tourist seeing a lesser pyramid . " Well , " she said as a big fenced-in Ford plant , flat and wide as Nebraska , hauled next into view , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't like the weather , wait ten minutes . That 's an expression we used to say in college . " She fattens her cheeks as Walter Reuther Boulevard flashes by , then the Fisher Building and the lumpish Olympia rises in the furred , gray distance . " They say that in Texas all the time . They prob'ly say it everywhere . " She looks back at the cityscape . " You know what my daddy says about De-troit ? " " He must not 've liked it very much . " " When I told him I was coming out today with you , he just said , If De-troit was ever a state , it 'd be New Jersey . ' " She smiles at me cunningly . " Detroit does n't have the diversity , though I really like both places . " " He likes New Jersey , but he did n't like this place . " We swerve into the long concrete trench of the Lodge freeway , headed to midtown . " He has n't ever liked a place much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This place does n't look so bad , though . Lots of colored , but that 's all right with me . They got ta live , too . " She nods seriously to herself , then takes my hand and squeezes it as we enter a vapor-lit freeway tunnel which takes us to the riverfront and the Pontchartrain . " This was the first city I ever knew . We used to come into town when I was in college and go to burlesque shows and smoke cigars . It seemed like the first American city to me . " " That 's the way Dallas is to me . I 'm not upset to be gone from it , though . Not a little teensy . " She purses her lips hard and turns loose of my hand . " My life 's lots better now , I 'll tell you that . " " Where would you rather be ? " I ask as the milky light of Jefferson Avenue dawns into our dark bus and passengers begin to murmur and clutch belongings up and down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the hotel loop . We are all of us itchy to be there . Vicki looks at me solemnly , as if the gravity of this city had entered her , making all lightheartedness seem sham . She is a girl who knows how to be serious . I had hoped , of course , she 'd say there 's no place she 'd rather than with m-e me . But I can not mold all her wishes to my model for them , fulfill her every dream as I do my own . Yet she is as unguarded to this Detroit chill as I am , and secretly it makes me proud of her . " Did n't you say you went to college around here somewhere ? " She 's thinking of something hard for her to come to , a glimmering of a thought . " About forty miles away . " " Well , what was that like ? " " It was a nice town with trees all around . A nice park for spring afternoons , decent profs . " " Do you miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best time in your life and you wish you had it back . Tell the truth . " " No ma'am , " I say . And it 's true . " I would n't change from right this moment . " " Ahhh , " Vicki says skeptically , then turns toward me in her seat , suddenly intense . " Do you swear to it ? " " I swear to it . " She fastens her lips together again and smacks them , her eyes cast to the side for thinking power . " Well , it id n't true with me . This is to answer where would I rather be . " " Oh . " Our Flxible comes hiss to a lumbering stop in front of our hotel . Doors up front fold open . Passengers move into the aisle . Behind Vicki out the tinted glass I see Jefferson Avenue , gray cars moiling by and beyond it Cobo , where Paul Anka is singing tonight . And far away across the river , the skyline of Windsor  --  glum , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first thing I did after Ralph was buried was buy a I-Iarley-Davidson motorcycle and take off driving west . I got as far as Buffalo , halfway across the  | Peace Bridge , then lost my heart and turned back . Something in Canada had taken the breath of spirit out of me , and I promised never to go back , though of course I have . ) " When I think about where would I rather be , " Vicki says dreamily , " what I think about is my first day of nursing school out in Waco . All of us were lined up in the girls ' dorm lobby , clear from the reception desk out to the Coke machine between the double doors . Fifty girls . And across from where I was standing was this bulletin board behind a little glass window . And I could see myself in it . And written on that bulletin board in white letters on black was We 're glad you 're here ' with an exclamation . And I remember thinking to myself , You 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're going to have a wonderful life . ' I remember that so clearly , you know ? A very wonderful life . " She shakes her head . " I always think of that . " We are last to leave the bus now , and other passengers are ready to depart . The driver is folding closed the baggage doors , our two sit on the damp and crowded sidewalk . " I do n't mean to be ole gloomy-doomy . " " You 're not a bit of gloomy-doomy , " I say . " I do n't think that for a minute . " " And I do n't want you to think I 'm not glad to be here with you , because I am . It 's the happiest day of my life in a long time , ' cause I just love all of this so much . This big ole town . I just love it so much . I did n't need to answer that right now , that 's all . It 's one of my failings . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do better just going along . " " It 's me that should n't ask it . But you 're going to let me make you happy , are n't you ? " I smile hopefully at her . What business do I have wanting to know any of this ? I 'm my own worst enemy . " I 'm happy . God , I 'm real happy . " And she throws her arms around me and cries a tiny tear on my cheek ( a tear , I want to believe , of happiness ) , just as the driver cranes his neck in and waves us out . " I 'd marry you , " she whispers . " I did n't mean to make fun of you asking me . I 'll marry you any time . "  | " We 'll try to fit it into our agenda , then , " I say and touch her moist soft cheek as she smiles through another fugitive tear . And then we are up and out and down and into the dashing wet wind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sop of old melted snow like cast-off smudges . A lone policeman stands watching , ready to chart their destination from this moment on . Vicki squeezes my arm , her cheek on my shoulder , as I heft the two cases . Her plaid canvas is airy ; mine , full of sportswriter paraphernalia , is a brick . And I feel exactly what at this debarking moment ? At least a hundred things at once , all competing to take the moment and make it their own , reduce undramatic life to a gritty , knowable kernel . This , of course , is a minor but pernicious lie of literature , that at times like these , after significant or disappointing divulgences , at arrivals or departures of obvious importance , when touchdowns are scored , knock-outs recorded , loved ones buried , orgasms notched , that at such times we are any of us altogether in an emotion , that we are within ourselves and not able to detect other emotions we might also be feeling , or be about to feel , or prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth about these moments , it usually fails , in my opinion , and it 's the writer 's fault for falling into such conventions . ( I tried to explain all of this to my students at Berkshire College , using Joyce 's epiphanies as a good example of falsehood . But none of them understood the first thing I was talking about , and I began to feel that if they did n't already know most of what I wanted to tell them , they were doomed anyway  --  a pretty good reason to get out of the teaching business . ) What I feel , in truth , as I swing these two suitcases off the wet concrete and our blue bus sighs and rumbles from the curbside toward its other routed hotels , and bellboys lurk behind thick glass intent on selling us assistance , is , in a word : a disturbance . As though I were relinquishing something venerable but in need of relinquishing . I feel a quickening in my pulse . I feel a strong sense of lurking  | evil ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will end ) . I feel a conviction that I have no ethics at all and little consistency . I sense the possibility of terrible regret in the brash air . I feel the need suddenly to confide ( though not in Vicki or anyone else I know ) . I feel as literal as I 've ever felt  --  stranded , uncomplicated as an immigrant . All these I feel at once . And I feel the urge ? which I suppress  --  to cry , the way a man would , for these same reasons , and more . That is the truth of what I feel and think . To expect anything less or different is idiotic . Bad sportswriters are always wanting to know such things , though they never want to know the truth , never have a place for that in their stories . Athletes probably think and feel the fewest things of anyone at important times  --  their training sees to that  --  though even they can be counted on to have more than one thing in their mind at a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , pressed against me like my shadow , sniffing away a final tear of arrival happiness . " It 's light as a feather duster . " " You 're not going to do anything from now on out but have fun , " I say , both bags up and moving . " You just let me see a smile . " And she smiles a smile as big as Texas . " Look , I ai n't p.g. , you know , " she says as the pneumatic hotel doors glide away . " I always carry what 's mine . " It is four-thirty by the time we get to our room , a tidy rectangle of pretentious midwestern pseudo-luxury  --  a prearranged fruit basket , a bottle of domestic champagne , blue bachelor buttons in a Chinese vase , red-flocked whorehouse wall decor and a big bed . There is an eleventh-story fisheye view upriver toward the gaunt Ren-Cen and gray pseudopodial Belle Isle in the middle distance ? the shimmer-lights of suburbs reaching north and west out of sight . Vicki takes a supervisory look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  makes 000 's and oh 's over what 's here free of charge by way of toiletries and toweling , then establishes herself in an armchair at the window , pops the champagne and begins to take  | everything in . It is exactly as I 'd hoped : pleased to respectful silence by the splendor of things  --  a vote that I have done things the way they were meant to be . I take the opportunity for some necessary phoning . First , a " touch base " call to Herb to firm up tomorrow 's plans . lie is in laughing good spirits and invites us to have dinner with him and Clarice at a steak place in Novi , but I plead fatigue and prior commitments , and I-Ierb says that 's great . He has become decidedly upbeat and shaken his glumness of the morning . ( He is on pretty serious mood stabilizers , is my guess . Who would n't be ? ) We hang up , but in two minutes Herb calls back to check whether he 's given me right directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his injury , he says , he 's suffered mild dyslexia and gets numbers turned around half the time with some pretty hilarious results . " I do the same thing , Herb , " I say , " only I call it normal . " But Herb hangs up without saying anything . Next I call Henry Dykstra , X 's father , out in Birmingham . I have made it my policy to keep in touch with him since the divorce . And though things were strained and extremely formal between us while X 's and my affairs were in the lawyers ' hands , we have settled back since then into an even better , more frank relationship than we ever had . Henry believes it was Ralph 's death pure and simple that caused our marriage to go kaput , and feels a good measure of sympathy for me  --  something I do n't mind having , even if my own beliefs about these matters are a good deal more complex . I have also stayed an intermediary message-carrier between Henry and his wife , Irma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly , and I have let him know that I can be trusted to keep a confidence and to relay timely information which is often something surprisingly intimate and personal . " The old plow still works , " he once asked me to tell her , and I did , though she never answered that I know of . Families are very hard to break apart forever . I know that . Henry is a robust seventy-one and , like me , has not remarried , though he often makes veiled but conspicuous references to women 's names without explanation . My personal belief  --  seconded by X ?  | is that he 's as happy as a ram living on his estate by himself and would 've had it that way from the day X was born if he could 've negotiated Irma . He is an industrialist of the old school , who worked his way up in the Thirties and has never really understood the concept of an intimate life , which I contend is not his fault , though X thinks otherwise and sometimes claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Henry says , in a bad temper . " The whole damn country has its pants around its ankles to the unions . 1111And we elected the S.O.B.s who 're doing it to us . Is n't that something ? Republicans ? I would n't give you a goddamned nickel for the first one they ever made . I stand somewhere to the right of Attila the Hun , I guess is what that means . " " I 'm not much up on it , Henry . It sounds tricky to me . " " Tricky ! It is n't tricky . If I wanted to steal and lay off everybody at my plant I could live for a hundred years , exactly the way I live now . Never leave the house . Never leave the chair ! I came up a Reuther man , you know that , Frank . Life-long . It 's these gangsters in Washington . All of them . They 're all goddamn criminals , want to run me in the ground . Retire me out of the gasket business . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still divorced ? " " Things 're great , Ilenry . Today 's Ralph 's birthday . " " Is that so ? " Henry does not like to talk about this , I know , but for me it is a day of some importance , and I do n't mind mentioning it . " I think he would 've made a fine adult , I lenry . I 'm sure of that . " For a moment then there is stupefied emptiness in our connection while we think over lost . chances . " Why do n't you come out here and we 'll get drunk , " Henry says abruptly . " I 'll have Lula fix duck en brochette . I killed the sons-of-bitches myself . We can call up some whores . I 've got their private phone numbers right here . Do n't think I do n't call them , either . " " That 'd be great , Henry . But I 'm not alone . " " Got a shady lady with you yourself ? " I lenry guffaws . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Downtown . I have to go hack tomorrow . I 'm on business today . " " Okay , okay . Tell me why you think our golfing friend left you , Frank ? Tell the truth . I ca n't get it off my mind today , for some damn reason . " " I think she wanted her life put back in her own hands , Henry . There 's not much else to it . " " She always thought I ruined her life for men . It 's a hell of a thing to hear . I never ruined anybody 's life . And neither did you . " " I do n't really think she thinks that now . " " She told me she did last week ! As late as that . I 'm glad I 'm old . It 's enough life . You 're here , then you 're not . " " I was n't always such a great guy , Henry . I tried hard but sometimes you can just fool yourself about yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God forgave Noah . You can forgive yourself . Who 's your shady lady ? " " You 'd like her . Her name 's Vicki . " Vicki swings her smiling head around and holds up a glass of champagne to toast me . " Bring her out here , I 'll meet her . What a name . Vicki . " " Another visit , Henry . We 're on a short schedule this time . " Vicki goes back to watching the night fall . " I do n't blame you , " Henry says brashly . " You know , Frank , sometimes the fact of living with somebody makes living with them impossible . Irma and I were just like that . I sent her to California one January , and that was twenty years ago . She 's a lot happier . So you stay down there with Vicki whatever . " " It 's hard to know another person . I admit that . " " You 're better off assuming anybody'lI do anything , anytime , than that they wo n't . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish I could come out there and get drunk with you , Henry , that 's the truth . I 'm glad we 're pals . Irma told me to tell you she 'd seen a real good performance of The Fantasticks in Mission Viejo . And it made her think of you . " " Irma did ? " Henry says . " What 's the fantastics ? " " It 's a play . "  | " Well , that 's good then , is n't it ? " " Any messages to go back ? I 'll probably write her next week . She sent me a birthday card . I could add something . " " I never really knew Irma , Frank . Is n't that something ? " " You were pretty busy making a living , though , Henry . " " She could 've had boyfriends and I would n't have even noticed . I hope she did . I certainly did . All I wanted . " " I would n't worry about that . Irma 's happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What about a message . Anything you want to say ? " " Tell her I have bladder cancer . " " Is that true ? " " I will have , if I do n't have something else first . Who cares any-way ? " " I care . You have to think of something else , or I 'll think of something for you . " " Flow 's Paul and how 's Clarissa ? " " They 're fine . We 're taking a car trip around Lake Erie this summer . And we 'll be stopping to see you . They 're already talking about it . Gj " We 'll go up to the U.P . " There might not be time for that . " ( I hope not . ) " They just want to see you . They love you very much . " " That 's great , though I do n't know how they could . What do you think about the Maize and Blue , Franky ? " " A powerhouse , is my guess , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! and the big Swede from Pellston 's in there again . I hear pretty awesome stories . It 's an impressive show out there . " This is the only ritual part of our conversations . I always check with the college football boys , particularly our new managing editor , a little neurasthenic , chain-smoking Bostonian named Eddie Frieder , so I can pass along some insider 's information to Henry , who never went to college , but is a fierce Wolverine fan nonetheless . It is the only use he can think to make of my profession , and I 'm not at all sure he does n't  | concoct an interest just to please me , though I do n't much like football per se . ( People have some big misunderstandings about sportswriters . ) " You 're going to see some fancy alignments in the defensive backfield this fall , that 's all I 'll say , Henry . " " All they need now is to fire that meathead who runs the whole show . He 's a loser , if you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins . " " The players all seem to like him , from what I hear . " " What the hell do they know ? Look . The means do n't always justify the end to me , Frank . That 's what 's wrong with this country . You ought to write about that . The abasement of life 's intrinsic qualities . That 's a story . " " You 're probably right , Henry . " " I feel hot about this whole issue , Frank . Sports is just a paradigm of life , right ? Otherwise who 'd care a goddamn thing about it ? " " I know people can see it that way . " ( I try to avoid that idea , myself . ) " But it 's pretty reductive . Life does n't need a metaphor in my opinion . " " Whatever that means . Just get rid of that guy , Frank . He 's a Nazi . " Henry says this word to rhyme with snazzy in the oldfashioned way . " His popularity 's his biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite a good coach and will probably end up in the Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio . He and Henry are almost exactly alike as human beings . " I 'll pass a word along , Henry . Why do n't you write a letter to The Readers Speak . " " I do n't have time . You do it . I trust you that far . " Light is falling outside the Pontchartrain now . Vicki sits in the shadows , her back to me , hugging her knees and staring out toward the Seagram 's sign upriver half a mile , red and gold in the twilight , while little Canuck houses light up like fireflies on a dark and faraway lake beach where I have been . I could want nothing more than to hug her now , feel her strong Texas back , and fall into a nestle we 'd break off only when the room service waiter tapped at our door . But I ca n't be sure she has n't lulled to sleep in the sheer relief of  | expectations met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred ways we could not be more alike , Vicki and I , and I miss her badly , though she is only twelve feet away and I could touch her shoulder in the dark with hardly a move ( this is one of the prime evils of being an anticipator ) . " Frank , we do n't amount to much . I do n't know why we go to the trouble of having opinions , " Henry says . " It puts off the empty moment . That 's what I think . " " What the hell 's that ? I do n't know what that is . " " Then you must 've been pretty skillful all your life , Henry . That 's great , though . It 's what I strive for . " " How old will you be next birthday ? You said you had a birthday . " For some reason Henry is gruff about this subject . " Thirty-nine , next week . " " Thirty-nine 's young . Thirty-nine 's nothing . You 're a remarkable man , Frank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry . " " Well no , you 're not . But I advise you , though , to think you are . I 'd be nowhere if I did n't think I was perfect . " " I 'll think of it as a birthday present , Henry . Advice for my later years . " " I 'll send you out a leather wallet . Fill it up . " " I 've got some ideas that 'll do just as good as a fat wallet . " " Is this this Vicki trick you 're talking about ? " " Right . " " I agree wholeheartedly . Everybody ought to have a Vicki in his life . Two 'd even be better . Just do n't marry her , Frank . In my experience these Vickis are n't for marrying . They 're sporting only . " " I 've got to be going now , Henry . " Our conversations often tend this way , toward his being a nice old uncle and then , as if by policy , making me want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're mad at me now , I know it . But I do n't give a I 1111 goddamn if you are . I know what I think . " " Fill your wallet up with that then , Henry , if you get my meaning . "  | " I get it . I 'm not an idiot like you are . " " I thought you said I was pretty remarkable . " " You are . You 're a pretty remarkable moron . And I love you like a son . " " This is the point to hang up now , Henry . Thanks . I 'm glad to hear that . " " Marry my daughter again if you want to . You have my permission . " " Good night , Henry . I feel the same way . " But like Herb Wallagher , Henry has already hung up on me , and never hears my parting words , which I sing off into the empty phone lines like a wilderness cry . Vicki has indeed gone to sleep in her chair , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Grosse Pointes : Park , Farms , Shores , Woods , communities tidy and entrenched in midwestern surety . I am hungry as an animal now , though when I rouse her with a hand on her soft shoulder , ready for a crab souffle or a lobsteak , amenable to a la carte up on the revolving roof , she wakes with a different menu in mind  --  one a fellow would need to be ready for the old folks ' home to pass up . ( She has drunk all the champagne , and is ready for some fun . ) She reaches and pulls me onto her chair so I 'm across her lap and can smell the soft olive scent of her sleepy breath . Beyond the window glass in the starless drifting Detroit night an ore barge with red and green running lights aglow hangs on the current toward Lake Erie and the blast furnaces of Cleveland . " Oh , you sweet old sweet man , " Vicki says to me , and wiggles herself comfortable . She gives me a moist soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " I read someplace that if the Taurus tells you he loves you , you 're s'posed to believe it . Is that so ? " " You 're a wonderful girl . " " Hmmmm . But ... " She smiles and hums.  | I have a good handful of her excellent breast now , and what a wonderful bunch she is , a treasure trove for a man interested in romance . " Does n't that make you happy ? " " Oh , that does . You know that . You 're the only one for me . " She I is no part a dreamer , I know it , but a literalist from the word go , happy to let the world please her in the small ways it can ( true of fewer and fewer people , women especially ) . Though it is probably not an easy thing to be here with me , in a strange glassy hotel in a cold and sinister town , strange as man to a mandrill , and to believe you are in love . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers . " Tell me what 'll make you happiest . That 's what I 'm here for , and that 's the truth " ( or most of it ) . " Well , do n't let 's sit on this ole chair all night and let that big ole granddaddy bed go to waste . I 'm a firecracker just thinking about you . I did n't think you 'd ever get off that phone . " " I 'm off now . " " You better look out then . " And then the cold room folds around us , and we become lost in simple nighttime love gloom , boats rafted together through a blear passage of small perils . A fair , tender Texas girl in a dark seance . Nothing could be better , more cordial than that . Nothing . Take this from a man who knows . Before my marriage ended but after Ralph died , in that wandering two-year period when I bought a F-Iarley-Davidson , drove to Buffalo , taught at a college , suffered that dreaminess I have only lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose my close moorings with X without even noticing the slippage , I must 've slept with eighteen different women  --  a number 1 do n't consider high , or especially scandalous or surprising under the circumstances . X , I 'm sure , knew it , and in retrospect I can see that she did her best to accommodate it , tried to make me feel not so miserable by not asking questions , not demanding a strict accounting of my days when I  | would be off working in some sports mecca  --  a Denver or a St. Louis  --  expecting , I feel sure , that one day or other I would wake up out of it , as she thought she already had ( but probably at this moment would be willing to doubt , wherever she might be  --  safe I hope ) . None of this would 've been so terrible , I believe , if I had n't reached a point with the women I was " seeing , " at which I was trying to simulate complete immersion  --  something anyone who travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when times got bad , I would , for example , find myself after a game alone in the pressbox of some concrete and steel American sports palace . Often as not there would be a girl reporter finishing up her late running story ( my eyes were sharpened for just such stragglers ) , and we would end up having a few martinis in some atmospheric-panoramic bar , then driving out in my renter to some little suburban foot-lit lanai apartment with rattan carpets , where a daughter waited  --  a little Mandy or Gretchen ? and no hubby , and where before I knew it the baby would be asleep , the music turned low , wine poured , and the reporter and I would be plopped in bed together . And bango ! All at once I was longing with all my worth to he a part of that life , longing to enter completely into that little existence of hers as a full ( if brief ) participant , share her secret illusions , hopes . " I love you , " I 've heard myself say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Marge I had n't known longer than four hours and fifteen minutes ! And being absolutely certain I did ; and , to prove it , loosing a barrage of pryings , human-interest questions  --  demands , in other words , to know as many of the whys and whos and whats of her life as I could . All of it the better to get into her life , lose that terrible distance that separated us , for a few drifting hours close the door , simulate intimacy , interest , anticipation , then resolve them all in a night 's squiggly romance and closure . " Why did you go to Penn State when you could 've gone to Bryn Mawr ? " I see . " What year did your ex-husband actually get out of the service ? " Hmmm . " Why did your sister get along better with your parents than you did ? " Makes sense . ( As if knowing anything could make any difference. )  | This , of course , was the world 's worst , most craven cynicism . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't bother anyone , but the demand for full-disclosure when I had nothing to disclose in return and could take no responsible interest in anything except the hope ( laughable ) that we could " stay friends , " and how early I could slip out the next morning and be about my business or head for home . It was also the worst kind of sentimentalizing ? feeling sorry for someone in her lonely life ( which is what I almost always felt , though I would n't have admitted it ) , turning that into pathos , pathos into interest , and finally turning that into sex . It 's exactly what the worst sportswriters do when they push their noses into the face of someone who has just had his head beaten in and ask , " What were you thinking of , Mario , between the time your head began to look like a savage tomato and the moment they counted you out ? " What I was doing , though I did n't figure it out until long after I 'd spent three months at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interested in disclosure  --  was trying to be within myself by being as nearly as possible within somebody else . It is not a new approach to romance . And it does n't work . In fact , it leads to a terrible dreaminess and the worst kind of abstraction and unreachahleness . How I expected to be within some little Elaine , Barb , Sue or Sharon I barely knew when I was n't even doing it with X in my own life is a good question . Though the answer is clear . I could n't . Bert Brisker would probably say about me , that at that time I was n't " intellectually pliant " enough , since what I was after was illusion complete and on a short-term , closed-end basis . And what I should 've been happy with was the plain , elementary rapture a woman  --  any woman I happened to like  --  could confer , no questions asked , after which I could 've gone home and let life please me in the ways I 'd always let it . Though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar , once luck 's running against him  --  which it was . By the time I came back from teaching three months , which was  | near the end of this two years , I 'd actually quit the whole business with women . But X had been home with Paul and Clary , and had not been communicating , and had begun reading The New Republic , The National Review and China Today , something she 'd never done before , and seemed remote . I fell immediately into a kind of dreamy monogamy that did nothing but make X feel like a fool  --  she said so eventually  --  for putting up with me until her own uncertainty got aroused . I was around the house every day , but not around to do any good for anybody , just reading catalogs , lying charitably to avoid full disclosure , smiling at my children , feeling odd , visiting Mrs. Miller weekly , musing ironically about the number of different answers I could give to almost any question I was asked , watching sports and Johnny on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought from L.L. Bean , going up to New York once a week and being a moderately good but committed sportswriter  --  all the while X 's face became indistinct , and my voice grew softer and softer until it was barely audible , even to me . Her belief  --  at least her way of putting things since then  --  was that I 'd grown " untrustworthy , " which is not surprising , since I probably was , if what she wanted was to be made happy by my making life as certain as could be , which 1 could 've sooner flown than do then . And when I could n't do that , she just began to suspect the worst about everything , for which I do n't blame her either , though I could tell that was n't a good idea . I contend that I felt pretty trustworthy then , in spite of everything  --  if she could 've simply trusted just that I loved her , which I did . ( Married life requires shared mystery even when all the facts are known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure of that , and I 'd have certainly been happy to have things stay the ? way they were while hoping for improvements . If you lose all hope , you can always find it again . Only our house got broken into , hateful Polaroids scattered around , the letters from the woman in Kansas found , and X seemed suddenly to think we were too far gone , farther gone than we knew , and life just seemed unascendant and to break between us , not savagely or even tragically , just ineluctably , as the real writers say .  | A lot happens to you in your life and comes to bear midway : your parents can die ( mine , though , died years before ) , your marriage can change and even depart , a child can succumb , your profession can start to seem hollow . You can lose all hope . Any one thing would be enough to send you into a spin . And correspondingly it is hard to say what causes what , since in one important sense everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can I say I " love " Vicki Arcenault ? How can I trust my instincts all over again ? A good question , but one I have n't avoided asking myself , for fear of causing more chaos in everybody 's life . And the answer like most other reliable answers is in parts . I have relinquished a great deal . I 've stopped worrying about being completely within someone else since you ca n't be anyway  --  a pleasant unquestioning mystery has been the result . I 've also become less sober-sided and " writerly serious , " and worry less about the complexities of things , looking at life in more simple and literal ways . I have also stopped looking around what I feel to something else I might be feeling . With all those eighteen women , I was so bound up creating and resolving a complicated illusion of life that I lost track of what I was up to  --  that I ought to be having a whale of a good time and forget about everything else . When you are fully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in , and the distance is closed between what you feel and what you might also feel , then your instincts can be trusted . It is the difference between a man who quits his job to become a fishing guide on Lake Big Trout , and who one day as he is paddling his canoe into the dock at dusk , stops paddling to admire the sunset and realizes how much he wants to be a fishing guide on Lake Big Trout ; and another man who has made the same decision , stopped paddling at the same time , felt how glad he was , but also thought he could probably be a guide on Windigo Lake if he decided to , and might also get a better deal on canoes . Another way of describing this is that it 's the difference between being a literalist and a factualist . A literalist is a man who will enjoy  | an afternoon watching people while stranded in an airport in Chicago , while a factualist ca n't stop wondering why his plane was late out of Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just a snack . And finally , when I say to Vicki Arcenault , " I love you , " I 'm not saying anything but the obvious . Who cares if I do n't love her forever ? Or she me ? Nothing persists . I love her now , and I 'm not deluding myself or her . What else does truth have to hold ? A t twelve-forty-five I am awake . Vicki sleeps beside me , breathing lightly with a soft clicking in her throat . In the room there is the dense dimensionless feeling of going to sleep in the dark though waking up still in the dark and wondering about the hours till dawn : how many will there be still ? Will I suffer some unexpected despair ? I low am I likely to pass the time ? I am usually  --  as I 've said  --  such a first-rate sleeper that I 'm not bothered by these questions . Though I 'm certain part of my trouble is the ordinary thrill of being here , with this woman , free to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all look and hope for . Tonight would be a good time to take a solo walk in the dark city streets , turn my collar up , get some things thought out . But I have nothing to think out . I turn on the television with the sound off , something I often do when I 'm on the road alone , while I browse a player roster or sharpen up some notes . I love the television in other cities , the assurance of looking up from my chair in some strange room to see a familiar newscaster talking in his familiar Nebraska accents , clad in a familiarly unappealing suit before a featureless civic backdrop ( I can never remember the actual news ) ; or to see an anonymous but completely engrossing athletic event acted out in a characterless domed arena , under the same lemony light , to the tune of the same faint zizzing , many miles from anywhere my face would be known . These comprise a comfort I would not like to do without . On television the station reruns a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detroit plays Seattle . ( Reruns , inciden-  | tally , are where you learn a game inside and out . They 're far superior to the actual game in the actual place it 's played , where things are usually pretty boring and you often forget altogether about what you 're there for and find yourself getting interested in other things . ) I go get Vicki 's Le Sac bag , open it up and take out one of her Merits , and light it . I have not smoked a cigarette in at least twenty years . Not since I was a freshman in college and attended a fraternity smoker where older boys gave me Chesterfields and I stood against a wall , hands in pockets , and tried to look like the boy everyone would want to ask to join : the silent , slender southern boy with eyes older than his years , something already jaded and over-experienced about him . Just the one we need . While I 'm at it , I push down through the bag . Here is a rosary ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A card of extra pearlescent buttons ( useful ) . Car keys to the Dart on a big brass ring with a V insignia . An open tube of Velamints . Two movie ticket stubs from a theater where Vicki and I saw part of an old Charlton Heston movie ( until I fell asleep ) . The flight-insurance policy . A paperback copy of a novel , Love 's Last Journey , by someone named Simone La Noire . And a fat , brown leather wallet with a tooled western-motif of a big horse head on shiny grain . In it  --  right up front  --  is a picture of a man I 've never seen before , a swank-looking greaseball character , wearing an open-collared white shirt and a white big-knit shepherd 's roll cardigan . The fellow has thick , black eyebrows , a complicated but strict system of dark hair waves , narrow eyeslits and a knifey smile set in the pouting , mocking angle of swarthy self-congratulation . Around his pencil-neck is a gold cross on a chain . It is Everett . The carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip-sprung lounge lizard in a fourth-rate Vegas motel ; the kind of fellow who wears his cigarettes under his shirt sleeve , possesses long , skinny arms and steely fingers , and as a policy drinks huge amounts of cheap beer at all hours of the day and night . I would recognize him anywhere . Lonesome Pines was full of such types , from the best possible homes , and all capable of the sorriest depravities . I could n't  | be more disappointed to find his picture here . Nor more perplexed . It 's possible that he is a superior , good-natured yokel and were we ever to meet ( which we wo n't ) , we 'd cement a sensible common ground from which to express earnestly our different opinions about the world . ( Sports , in fact , is the perfect lingua franca for such crabwise advances between successive boyfriends and husbands who might otherwise fall into vicious fistfights . ) But in truth I could n't give a damn about Everett 's selling points . And I am of a mind to flush his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first complaint is offered . I take a deep , annoyed drag on my cigarette and attempt a difficult French Inhale I once saw practiced in college . But the smoke gets started backwards in my throat and not up my nose , and suddenly I 'm seized by a terrifying airlessness and have to suppress a horrible gagging . I make a swift stagger into the bathroom and close the door to keep from waking Vicki with a loud grunt-cough that purples my face . In the bathroom mirror I resemble a wretched sex-offendercigarette dangling in my fingers , blue-piped pajamas rumpled , my fact gaunt from gasping , the stern light pinching my eyes narrow as Everett 's . I am not a pretty sight , and I 'm not a bit happy to see myself here . I should have gone out in the streets alone and figured out something to figure out . Certain situations dictate to you how they should be used to advantage . And you should always follow the conventional wisdom in those cases  --  in fact , in all cases . Always go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always take a late-night swim after your hosts are in bed . Always take a hike in the woods near your friends ' cabin and try to find a new route to the waterfall or an old barn to explore . If nothing else you save yourself giving in to a more personal curiosity and the trouble that always seems to cause . I have gone poking around after full disclosure before my disavowal of it is barely out of my mouth  --  a disappointing testimony to self-delusion , even more disappointing than finding dagger-head Everett 's picture in Vicki 's pocketbook where , after all , it had every right to be and I had none .  | When I exit the bathroom Vicki is seated at the dressing table , smoking one of her own Merits , elbow on the chair hack , the TV off , looking sultry and alien as a dancehall girl . She is wearing a black crepe de Chine " push up " nightgown and matching toeless mules . I do n't like the spiky looks of this ( though it 's conceivable I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like something Everett would like , might even have bought himself as a final , fragrant memento . I would not stand for it one minute if I was calling the shots , which I 'm not . " I did n't mean to wake you up , " I say balefully and slink to the end of the big granddaddy bed , two feet from her sovereign knees , where I take a seat . Evil has begun to lurk the room , ready to grip with its cold literal claws . My heart begins pounding the way it was when I woke up this morning , and I feel as if my voice may become inaudible . I am caught . Though I would save the moment , save us from anger and regret and even more disclosure , the enemy of intimacy . I wish I could blurt out a new truth ; that I suffer from a secret brain tumor and sometimes do inexplicable things I afterwards ca n't discuss ; or that I 'm writing a piece on pro basketball and need to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a zone and everything comes down to one shot the way it always does . The saved moment is the true art of love . Staring , though , at Vicki 's sculptured , vaguely padded knees , I now am clearly lost and feel the ultimate slipping away again , bereavement threatening like thunder to roll in and take its place . " So what is it you were lookin for in my bag ? " she says . Hers is a frown of focused disdain . I am the least favorite student caught looking for the gradebook in the teacher 's desk . She is the friendly substitute there for one day only ( though we all wish she were the regular one ) but who knows a sneak when she sees him . " I was n't looking for anything , really . I was n't looking . " I was looking , of course . And this is the wrong lie , though a lie is absolutely what 's needed . My first tiny skirmish with the facts goes into the  | debit column . My voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't keep secrets , " she says now in a flat voice . " I suppose you do though . " " Sometimes I do . " I lose nothing admitting that . " And you lie about things , too . " " Only if it 's completely necessary . Otherwise never . " ( It is better than confiding . ) " And like lovin me , too , I guess ? " A sweet girl 's heart only speaks truths . Evil suddenly takes an unexpected rebuke . " You 're wrong there , " I say , and nothing could be truer . " Humph , " she says . Her brow gathers over small prosecutorial eyes . " And I 'm s'pose to believe that now , right ? With you rammaging around my things and smokin cigarettes and me dreaming away ? " " You do n't have to believe it for it to be true . " I put my elbows on my knees , honest-injun style . " I hate a snake , " she says , looking coldly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coiled right there . " I just swear I do . I stay way clear of ' em . Cause I seen plenty . Right ? They 're not hard to recognize , either . " She cuts her eyes away at the door to the hall and sniffs a little mirthless laugh . " That was just a lie on me , wad n't it ? " " The only way you 'll find that out , I guess , is just to stay put . " Out in the chilly streets I hear a police siren wail down the wide , dark avenue and drawl off into the traffic . Some poor soul is having it worse than I am . " So what about getting married ? " she says archly . " That , too . " She smirks her mouth into a look of disillusionment and shakes her head . She stubs out her cigarette carefully in the ashtray . She has seen this all before . Motel rooms . Two A.M. Strange sights . The sounds of strange cities and sirens . Lying boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Empty moments . The least of us has seen a hundred . It is no wonder mystery and its frail muted beauties have such a son-of-a-bitching hard time of it . They 're way outnumbered and ill-equipped in the best of times . " Well-o-well , " she says and shrugs , hands down between her knees in a fated way . But still , something has been won back , some aspirant tragedy averted . I am not even sure what it is , since evil still floods the room up to the cornices . The Lebanese woman I knew at Berkshire College would never have let this happen , no matter what I had done to provoke it , since she was steeled for such things by a life of Muslim disinterest . X would n't either , though for other , even better reasons ( she expected more ) . Vicki is hopeful , but not of much , and so is never far from disappointment . Still , the worst reconciliation with a woman is better than the best one you work out with yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even finding out about , " Vicki says wearily , everting her lips at her weekender as if it were a wreckage that has washed ashore after years of not being missed . " Money , " she says languidly , " I keep hid in a special place . That 's one secret I keep . You wo n't get that . " I want to hug her knees , though this is clearly hands-to-yourself time . The slightest wrong move will see me on the phone locating another room on another floor , possibly in the Sheraton , four cold and lonely blocks away , and no coat to keep out the slick Canadian damp . Vicki peers over at the glass desktop , at her wallet open alongside her cigarettes . The snapshot of brain-dead Everett leers upwards ( it may in fact be hard to tell my somber , earnest face from his ) . " I really believe there 's only six people in the world , " she says in a softened voice , staring down at Everett 's mug . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I think you had too many girlfriends already . Maybe you 're somebody else 's one . " " You might be wrong . I could still make the line-up . "  | She looks at me distrustfully . " Eyes are important to me , okay ? They 're windows to your soul . And your eyes ... I used to think I could see your soul back in there . But now . . . . " She shakes her head in doubt . " What do you see ? " I do n't want to hear the answer . It is a question I would never even ask Mrs. Miller , and one she 'd never take it upon herself to speculate about . We do not , after all , deal in truths , only potentialities . Too much truth can be worse than death , and last longer . " I do n't know , " Vicki says , in a thin wispy way , which means I had better not pursue it or she 'll decide . " What 're you so interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddly . " I do n't know your stepbrother , " I say . She picks up the wallet and holds the snapshot up so I am looking directly into the swarthy smart-aleck 's face . " I lint , " she says . " This poor old thing , here . " So much of life ca n't be foreseen . A hundred private explanations and exculpations come rushing up into my throat , and I have to swallow hard to hold them back . Though , of course , there is nothing to say . Like all needless excuses , the unraveling is not worth the time . However , I feel a swirling dreaminess , an old familiar bemusement , suddenly rise into my appreciation of everything around me . Irony is returned . I have a feeling that if I tried to speak now , my mouth would move , but no sound would occur . And it would scare us both to death . Why , in God 's name , is n't it possible to let ignorance stay ignorance ? " That poor boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turns the picture toward her and looks at it appraisingly . " He got killed at Fort Sill , Oklahoma . A Army truck hit him . He 's my Daddy 's wife 's son . Was . Bernard Twill . Beane Twill . " She pops the wallet closed and puts it on the table . " I did n't even really know him . Lynette just gave me his picture for my wallet when he died . I do n't know how come I kept it . " She looks at me in a sweet way . " I 'm not stayin mad . It 's just an old purse with nothin in it . Women 're strange on their purses. "  | " I 'm going to get back in bed , " I say in a voice that is hardly a whisper . " Long as you 're happy , to hell with the rest . That 's a good motto , is n't it ? " " Sure . It 's great , " I say , crawling into the big cold bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles and sits looking at me as I pull the sheet up around my chin and begin to think that it is not a hard life to imagine , not at all , mine and Vicki Arcenault 's . In fact , 1 would like it as well as it 's possible to like any life : a life of small flourishes and clean napkins . A life where sex plays an ever-important nightly role ? better than with any of the eighteen or so women I knew before and " loved . " A life appreciative of history and its generations . A life of possible fidelity , of going fishing with some best friend , of having a little Sheila or a little Matthew of our own , of buying a fifth-wheel travel trailer  --  a cruising brute  --  and from its tiny portholes seeing the country . Paul and Clarissa could come along and join our gang . I could sell my house and move not to Pheasant Run but to an old Quakerstone in Bucks County . Possibly when our work is done , a tour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our lives . " I would n't need to sleep in my clothes or wake up on the floor . I could forget about being in my emotions and not be bothered by such things . In short , a natural extension of almost all my current attitudes taken out beyond what I now know . And what 's wrong with that ? Is n't it what we all want ? To look out toward the horizon and see a bright , softened future awaiting us ? An attractive retirement ? Vicki turns on the television and takes up a rapt stare at its flicking luminance . It 's ice skating at 2 A.M. ( basketball 's a memory ) . Austria , by the looks of it . Cinzano and Rolex decorate the boards . Tai and Randy are skating under steely control . I-1e is Mr. Elegance  --  flying camels , double Salchows , perfect splits and lofts . She is all in the world a man could want , vulnerable yet fiery , lithe as a swan , in this their once-in-a-lifetime , everything-right for a flawless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axel , two soaring triple toe loops , a spinning Lutz jump , then come to rest with Tai in a death spiral on the white ice , Randy her goodly knight . And the Austrians can not control it one more second . These two are as good as the Protopopovs , and they 're Americans . Who cares if they missed the Olympics ? Who cares if rumors are true that they despise each other ? Who cares if Tai is not so beautiful up close ( who is , ever ) ? She is still eic as a Berber with regal thighs and thunderous breasts . And what 's important is they have given it their everything , as they always do , and every Austrian wishes he could be an American for just one minute and ca n't resist feeling right with the world . " Oh , do n't you just love them two ? " Vicki says , sitting crosslegged on her chair , smoking a cigarette and peering into the brightly lit screen as though staring into a colorful dream-life . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be her so much , " she says , blowing smoke out the corner of her mouth . " Really . Ole Randy .... " I turn and close my eyes and try to sleep as the applause goes on , and outside in the cold Detroit streets more sirens follow the first one into the night . And for a moment I find it is really quite easy and agreeable not to know what 's next , as if the sirens were going out into this night for no one but me.  | Snow . By the time I leave my bed , a blanket of the gently falling white stuff has covered the concrete river banks from Cobo to the Ren-Cen , the river sliding by brackish and coffee-colored under a quilted Michigan sky . So much for a game under the lights . Spring has suddenly disappeared and winter stepped in . I am certain by tomorrow the same weather will have reached New Jersey ( we are a day behind the midwest in weather matters ) , though by then , here will have thawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather , wait ten minutes . Vicki is still deep asleep in her black crepe de Chine , and though I would like to wake her and have a good heart-to-heart , last night feels otherwordly , and optimism about " us two " is what 's in need of emphasizing . A talk can always wait till later . I shower and dress in a hurry , pockets loaded with note pads and a small recorder , and head off to breakfast and my trip to Walled Lake . I leave a note on the bed table saying I 'll be back by noon , and she should watch a movie on HBO and have a big breakfast sent up . The Pontchartrain lobby has a nice languorous-sensuous Saturday feel despite the new snow , which the bellhops all agree is " freakish " and ca n't last past noon , though a number of guests are lining up to check out for the airport . The black newsstand girl sells me a Free Press with a big smile and a yawn . " I 'm bout shoulda stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the rack there is an issue of my H magazine with a story I wrote about the surge in synchronized swimming in Mexico  --  all the digging work was done by staff . I 'm tempted to make some mention of it just in passing , but I wander off to breakfast instead . In the La Mediterranee Room I order two poached , dry toast and  | juice , and ask the waiter to hurry , while I check on the early leaders in the AL East  --  who 's been sent down , who 's up for a cup of coffee . The Free Press sports section has always been my favorite . Photographs galore . A crisp wide-eyed layout with big , readable coldtype print and a hometown writing style anyone could feel at home with . There is a place for literature , but a bigger one for sentences that are meant to be read , not mused over : " Former Brother Rice standout , Phil Staransky , who picked up a couple timely hits in Wednesday 's twi-nighter , on the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Trumbull betting he 'll see more time at third before the club starts its first swing west . Pitching Coach Eddie Gonzalez says there 's no doubt the Hamtramck native figures in the big club 's plans , especially , ' Gonzalez notes , since the young man left off trying to pull everything and began swinging with his head . ' " When I was in college I had a pledge bring it right to my bed every morning , and was even a mail subscriber when we first moved to Haddam . From time to time I think of quitting the magazine and coming back out to do a column . Though I 'm sure it 's too late for that now . ( The local sports boys never take kindly to the national magazine writers because we make more money . And in fact , I 've been given haywire information from a few old beat writers , which , if I 'd used it , would 've made me look stupid in print . ) It has the feeling of an odd morning , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun in the pit of my stomach , a feeling that is not unpleasant but insistent . Several people I saw in the lobby have reminded me of other people I know , an indicator that something exceptional 's afoot . A man in the checkout line reminded me of  --  of all people  --  Walter Luckett . Even the black shop girl put me in mind of Peggy Connover , the woman I used to write in Kansas and whose letters caused X to leave me . Peggy , in fact , was Swedish and would laugh to think she looked a bit Negroid . Like all signs , these can be good or bad , and I choose to infer from them that life , anyone 's life , is not as disconnected and random as it might feel , and that down deep we 're all reaching out for a decent rewarding contact every chance we get .  | Last night , after Vicki went to sleep , I experienced the strangest H dream , a dream I 've never had before and one I would rather not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin with , and almost never remember them past the moment just before my eyes open . When I do , I can usually ascribe everything to something I 've eaten in the afternoon , or to a book I 'd been reading . And for the most part there 's never much that 's familiar in them anyway . But in this dream I was confronted by someone I knew  --  a man ? but had forgotten  --  though not completely , because there were Hashes of recollection I could n't quite organize into a firm picture-memory . This man mentions to me  --  so obliquely that now I ca n't even remember what he said  --  something shameful about me , clearly shameful , and it scares me that he might know more and that I 've forgotten it , but should n't have . The effect of all this was to shock me roundly , though not to wake me up . When I did wake up at eight , I remembered the entire dream clear as a bell , though I could jl not fill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides not being a good collector of my dreams , I am not much a believer in them either or their supposed significance . Everyone I 've ever talked to about dreams  --  and Mrs. Miller , I 'm happy to say , feels exactly as I do , and will not listen to anyone 's dreams ? everyone always interprets their dreams to mean something unpleasant , some lurid intention or ungenerous , guilty desire crammed back into the subconscious cave where its only chance is to cause trouble at a later time . Whereas what I am a proponent of is forgetting . Forgetting dreams , qq grievances , old flaws in character  --  mine and others ' . To me there is no hope unless we can forget what 's said and gone before , and forgive it . Which is exactly why this particular dream is bothersome . It is about forgetting , and yet there seems to be a distinct thread of unforgiving in it , which is the source of the shock I felt even deep in pl sleep , in an old town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where I want nothing more than that the present be happy and for the future  --  as it always does  --  to look after itself . I would  | prefer to think of all signs as good signs , or else to pay no attention to them at all . There are enough bad signs all around ( read the New York Times ) not to pick out any particular one for attention . In the case of my dream , I ca n't even think of what I ought to be anxious about , since I am eager  --  even ascendant . And if it is that I 'm anxious in the old mossy existential sense , it will have to stay news to me . It is , of course , an irony of ironies that X should 've left me because of Peggy Connover 's letters , since Peggy and I had never committed the least indiscretion . She was a woman I met on a plane from Kansas City to Minneapolis , and whom in the space of an afternoon , a dinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you could know in that length of time . She was thirty-two and not at all an appealing woman . She was plump with large , white teeth and a perfectly pie-shaped face . She was leaving her family with four children , back in the town of Blanding , Kansas , where her husband sold insulation , to go live with her sister in northern Minnesota and become a poet . She was a good-natured woman , with a nice dimpled smile , and on the plane she began to tell me about her life  --  how she had gone to Antioch , studied history played field hockey , marched in peace marches , written poems he told me about her parents who were Swedish immigrants ? fact that had always embarrassed her ; that she dreamed sometimes of huge trucks going over cliffs and woke 4 up terrified ; about writing poems that she showed to her husband , Van , then hearing him laugh at them , though he later told her he was proud of her . She told me she had been a sexpot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami of Ohio , because she loved him , but that they were n't on the same level educationally , which had n't mattered then , but did now , which was why she felt she was leaving him . When we got off the plane she asked me , standing in the concourse , where I was staying , and when I told her the Ramada , she said she could just as easily stay there and that maybe we could have dinner together because she liked talking to me . And since I had nothing else to do , I said okay .  | In the next five hours we had a buffet dinner , then after that went down to my room to drink a bottle of German wine she had bought for her sister , and she talked some more , with me just adding a word here and there . She told me about her break with Lutheranism , about her philosophy of child-rearing , about her theories of Abstract Expressionism , the global village , and a Great Books course she 'd built up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven-fifteen , she stopped talking , looked down at her pudgy hands and smiled . " Frank , " she said , " I just want to tell you that I 've been thinking about sleeping with you this whole time . But I do n't really think I should . " She shook her head . " I know we 're supposed to do what our senses dictate , and I 'm very attracted to you , but I just do n't think it would be right , do you ? " Her face looked troubled by this , but when she looked at me a big hopeful smile came on her lips . And what I felt for her then was a great and comprehending nostalgia , because for some reason I thought I knew just exactly how she felt , alone and at the world 's mercy , the same way I 'd felt when I 'd been in the Marines , suffering from an unknown disease with no one but unfriendly nurses and doctors to check on me , and I had had to think about dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me feel about Peggy Connover was that I wanted to make love to her  --  more , in fact , than I 'd wanted to do that in a long time . It 's possible , let me tell you , to become suddenly attracted to a woman you do n't really find attractive ; a woman you 'd never want to take to dinner , or pick up at a cocktail party , or look twice at in an elevator , only just suddenly it happens , which was the case with Peggy . Though what I said was , " No , Peggy , I do n't think it would be right . I think it 'd cause a lot of trouble . " I do n't know why I said this or said it in this way , since it was n't what my senses were dictating . Peggy 's face lit up with pleasure , and also , I think , surprise . ( This is always the most vulnerable time in such encounters . At the very moment you absolve yourself of any intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms . Though we did n't . ) What  | happened was that Peggy came over to the bed where I was sitting , sat beside me , took my hand and squeezed it , gave me a big damp kiss on the cheek and sat smiling at me as if I were a man like no other . She told me how lucky she felt to meet me and not some " other type , " since she was vulnerable that night , she said , and probably " fair game . " We talked for a while about how she was probably going to feel in the morning after having drunk all that wine , and that we would probably want a lot of coffee . Then she said that if it was all right she 'd like to find something I 'd written and read it and write me about it . And I said I 'd like that . Then as if by some secret signal she came around the bed , pulled back the covers , climbed in beside me and went immediately to snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night fully clothed , on top of the covers , and never touched her once . And in the morning I left before she woke up , to go interview a football coach , and never saw her again . After about a month , a fat letter  --  the first of several from Peggy Connover  --  arrived at the house , full of talk about her kids , humorous remarks about her welfare , her weight , her ailments , about Van , whom she 'd decided to go back to live with , what plans she was making for their life ; but also about stories of mine she 'd read in the magazine and had comments on ( she liked some but not every one ) , all of it in the same chatty voice as when we 'd talked , closing each time with " Well , Frank , hope to see you again real soon . Love , Peg . " All of which I was happy to hear about , and even answer a time or two , since it pleased me that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be , with everything hunky-dory . And it pleased me that somewhere out in the remote world someone was thinking of me for no bad reason at all , and even wishing me well . These , of course , were the letters X found in the drawer of my desk when she was looking for the sack of silver dollars she feared might 've been stolen . And it was these letters that in some way made our life seem to break apart for her , and made continuing somehow seem impossible ( I found it likewise impossible to explain anything then , since much else was wrong already ) . X believed , I think , when  | she read Peggy Connover 's letters , that if these chatty , normal overthe-fence-sounding sentiments were hidden there in my drawer ( they were n't hidden , of course ) , in all probability more letters full of similar good sense and breezy humor were going out ( she was right ) . And that there was none of that around the house for her . And she began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity for me  --  which may even be true  --  and she did n't like that . And what she suddenly concluded was that she did n't want to , or have to , be married to someone like me a second longer  --  which is exactly how it happened . Outside , it is no longer snowing , but the streets impress me as too icy to risk a rental car . Our time in town feels already much too short , and in bad weather even the idea of the botanical garden begins to sink into the unlikely zone  --  though for Vicki , my guess is , it will make no difference . I 'm sorry , however , to miss a renter . There is nothing quite like the first moments inside a big , strapping fleet-clean LTI ) or Montego  --  mileage checked , tank full , seat adjusted , the heavy door closed tight , the stirring " new " smell in your nostrils  --  the confidence that here is a car better even than the one you own ( and even better than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this one craps out ) . To me , there is no feeling of **30;879;TOOLONG quite like that . New today . New tomorrow . Eternal renewal on a manageable scale . I walk down to the snowy cab queue at Larned Street , but as I reach the icy corner I am stopped short and for a moment by a sound . On the chill Saturday morning airs , a faint hsss murmurs up the city streets from the sewers and alleyways , as if a cold wind was thrashing ditch grass somewhere nearby and , out here near the river , on the edge of things , I was in danger . Of what I have no idea . Though what I know , of course , is that I am running a tricky race now with my spirits , trusting my enthusiasm will outstrip the perils  | of usual , midwestern literalness which can gang up against you quick and do you in like a doomed prisoner . My cab driver is a giant Negro named Lorenzo Smallwood , who reminds me of the actor Sydney Greenstrcet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him . On the dashboard he has an assortment of small framed pictures of babies , two pairs of baby shoes and a mat of white fringe , though he is not much for talking , I and we get quickly out into the snowy traffic , weaving around dingy warehouse blocks and old hotels to Grand River , then head for the northwest suburbs . It is faster today , Mr. Smallwood says with humming uninterest , to stay on the " real streets , " and avoid " the Lodge , " where it 's already wall-to-wall assholes heading for their cabins up north . Strathmore , Brightmoor , Redford , Livonia , another Miracle Mile . We speed through the little connected burgs and townlets beyond the interior city , along white-frame dormered-Cape streets , into solider red-brick Jewish sections until we emerge onto a wide boulevard with shopping malls and thick clusters of traffic lights , the houses newer and settled in squared-off tracts . Outside everyone is " dressed for it , " a point of traditional pride among Michiganders . A freak spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his Plymouth , and a winter face of workmanlike weather how-to . Michigan is a place where every man is handy with a jumper cable , a metal lathe and a snow blower . The mechanical nuts-and-bolts of anything is never a problem here . It 's what 's reliable and appealing in such an otherwise gray and unprepossessing panorama . Far out crowded Grand River I am struck by what seems like thousands of restaurants , and by how dedicated the population is to going out to eat . As much as cars , meals are what 's on people 's minds . Though there is a small and heart-swelling glory to these places  --  chop houses , hofbraus , rathskellers , rib joints , cafes of all good quality . Part of life 's essence is here . And on a brooding spring eve , a fast foray out to any one of them can be just enough to make any out-of-the-way loneliness bearable another nighttime through .  | In most ways , I can promise you , Michigan knows exactly what it 's doing . It knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white enamel drive-in called The Squatter , and asks if I want a sinker . I am full to the gills from breakfast , but while he is inside I step out and give a call back to the Pontchartrain . I have briefly won back some enthusiam for the day  --  the buzzing in my stomach having subsided  --  and I want to share it all with Vicki , since there is no telling what new world and circumstances she has waked to , given the night 's shenanigans and the strange , whitened landscape confronting her in the daylight . " I was just layin here watching the television , " she says in a bright voice . " Just like you said for me to do in your cute note . I already ordered up a Virgin Mary and a honey pull-apart . There 's nothing on TV yet , though . A movie 's next , supposedly . " " I 'm sorry about last night , " I say softly , my voice taking a sudden decibel dive , so that I can barely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What happened last night , lessee ? " I can hear the TV and the sound of ice cubes in her Virgin Mary tinking against the glass . It is a reassuring sound , and I wish I could be there to snuggle up under the warm covers with her and wait for the movie . " I was n't at my best , but I 'll do better , " I say almost soundlessly . I smell warm hash browns , a waffle , an order of French toast humming out of The Squatter 's exhaust fan , and I am suddenly starving . " This hotel 's a good place to spend your money , " she says , ignoring me completely . " Well then , go spend some . " " I 'm watching something real cerebral right now , " she says , distracted . " It 's about how the government takes back fifteen tons of old money every week . Mostly just ones . That 's the work-horse bill . A hundred-dollar bill lasts for years , though it dud n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to figure out how to make shingles out of them . But right now all they can make is note pads . " " Are you having a swell time ? " " So far . " She laughs a happy girlish laugh . I see Mr. Smallwood  | come rolling out the front of The Squatter , a small white paper bag in one huge hand and a sinker half in his mouth . The snow has already begun to melt to slush in the curb gutters . " I love you , okay , " I say , and suddenly feel terribly feeble . My heart pounds down on itself like an anvil , and I have that old aguesense that my next breath will bring down a curtain of bright red over my eyes , and I will slump to the phone booth glass and cease altogether . " I love you , " I hear myself murmur again . " It 's okay with me . But you 're a nut , I 'll tell you that . " She is gay now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that all you called up here to say ? " " You just wait 'll I get back , " I say , " I 'll . . . . " But for some reason I do not finish the sentence . " Do you miss your wife ? " she says as gay as can be . " Are you crazy ? " It is clear she has not gotten my point . " Oh boy . You 're some kind of something , " she says . I hear silverware clink against plates , the sound of the receiver getting far away from her . " Now you hurry back and let me go and watch this . " Clickety-click . Ten minutes later we are into the rolling landscape of snowy farmettes and wide cottage-bound lakes beyond the perimeter of true Detroit suburbia , the white-flight areas stretching clear to Lansing . It is here that Mr. Smallwood suggests we turn off the meter and arrange a flat rate , which , when I agree , starts him whistling and suggesting he could hang around till I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , in nearby Wixom , and we agree that I 'll be ready to roll by noon . I remember , briefly , a boy I knew in college from Wixom , Eddy Loukinen , and I enjoy a fond wonder as to where Eddy might be  --  running a car dealership in his hometown , or down in Royal Oak with his own construction firm . Possibly an insulated window frame outlet in the UP  --  trading cars ever year , checking his market shares , quitting smoking , flying to the islands , slipping around on his wife . These were the futures we all had looking at us in 1967 . Good choices . We were not all radicals and wild-eyes . And  | most of my bunch would tell you they 're glad to have a good thirty years left to see what surprises life brings . The possibility of a happy ending . It is not unique to me. 1,11 It takes two gas station stops to find Herb 's . Both owners claim to know him and to work on his cars exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if I might be looking for big Herb to do him harm or steal his fame . And in each instance Mr. Smallwood and I drive off feeling that phone calls arc being made , a protective community rising to a misconstrued threat against its fallen hero . All of which makes me realize just how often I am with people I do n't know and who do n't know me , and who come to know me  --  Frank Bascombe  --  only as a sportswriter . It is possibly not the best way to go into the world , as I explained to Walter two nights ago ; with no confidants , with no real allies except ex-allies ; no lovers except a Vicki Arcenault or her ilk . Though maybe this is the best for me , given my character and past , which at most are inconclusive . I could have things much worse . At least as a stranger to almost everyone and a sportswriter to boot , I have a clean slate almost every day of my life , a chance not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , to recognize courage and improvement , to take the battle with cynicism head-on and win . Out front of Herb 's house , I 'm greeted from around the side by H a loud " Hey now ! " before I can even see who 's talking . Mr. Smallwood stares out his closed cab window . He has heard of Herb , he 's said , though he has the story of Herb 's life wrong and thinks I lerb is a Negro . In any case he wants to see him before he cuts out for Wixom . Herb 's house is on curvey little Glacier Way , a hundred yards from Walled Lake itself and not far from the amusement park that operates summers only . I came here long ago , when I was in college , to a dense , festering old barrely dancehall called the Walled Lake Casino . It was at the time when line dances were popular in Michigan , and my two friends and I drove over from Ann Arbor with the thought of picking up some women , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up standing against the firred ,  | scarred old walls being wry and sarcastic about everyone and drinking Cokes spiked with whiskey . Since then , Mr. Smallwood has informed me , the Casino has burned down . Herb 's house is like the other houses around it  --  a little white Cape showing a lot of dormered roof and with a small picture window on one side of the front door . The kind of house a tool-and-dye maker would own  --  a sober Fifties structure with a small yard , a two-car garage in back and a van in the drive with HERB 'S on its blue Michigan plates . Herb wheels into view from around the corner of the house , making tire tracks in the melting snow . The moment he is visible , Mr. Smallwood puts his cab in gear and goes whooshing off down the street and around the corner , leaving me alone in the front yard with Herb Wallagher , stranded like a prowler . " I thought you 'd be bigger , " Herb shouts with a big gap-toothed grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I embrace it he nearly hauls me down to the ground . " I thought you 'd be smaller , Herb , " I say , though this is a lie . lie is much smaller than I thought . His legs have shrunk and his shoulders are bony . Only his head and arms are good-sized , giving him 4 a gaping , storkish appearance behind his thick horn-rims . He has twice cut himself shaving and doctored it with toilet paper , and is wearing a T-shirt that says BIONIC on the front , and a pair of glenplaid Bermudas below which a brand new pair of red tennis shoes peek out . It is hard to think of Herb as an athlete . " I like to be outside on a day like this , Frank . It 's a wonderful day , is n't it ? " Herb looks all around at the sky like a caged man , making his head go loose on its stem . " It 's a great day , Herb . " We both , for the moment , affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead wrong about the weather . It looks like it may snow again and go nasty before the morning is over . 4 " Every year it got to be spring , ya know , I 'd start thinking about motorcycles or some kind of hot car to buy . I had four or five cars and two or three bikes . " I Ierb sits looking away toward a spot above  | the coping of the house across the street , a house exactly like hip except for the pale-blue roof . Beyond it several streets away Walled Lake shines through the yard gaps like metal . I am sorry to hear Herb referring to his life in the past tense . It is not an optimistic sign . " Well , Frank , how do you wan na get this over with , " Herb almost shouts at me in his put-on Kansas brogue . He smiles another big fierce smile , then pops both his hands on the black , plastic armrests of his chair as though he 'd like nothing better than to spring up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house or walk to the lake or what ? It 's your choice . " " Let 's try the lake , I ierb , " I say . " I used to come over here when I was in college . I 'd be happy to see it again . " " Clarice ! " Ilerb bellows , frowning up toward the little front door , squirming in his chair and muling it to face the way he wants . I lc is not interested in my past , though that 's no crime since I am not much interested myself . " Clar-eeeece ! " The door opens behind the storm-glass and a slender , pretty black woman with extremely short hair and wearing jeans steps half out onto the step . She gives me a watery half-smile . " Clarice , this is old Frank Bascombe . He 's gon na try to make a monkey outa me , but I 'm going to kick his keister for him . We 're going to the lake . You better bring us a coupla bathing suits , cause we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in mockery . " I 'm keeping my distance from him , Mrs. Wallagher . " I give her a friendly smile to match the frail one she has given me . " Herb 'll talk too much to swim , " Clarice says , shaking her head patiently at herb the perennial bad boy . " Okay , okay , do n't let 's get her started , " Herb growls , then grins . It is their little burlesque , though it 's an odd thing to see in people of two different races , and so young . Herb could n't he thirty-four yet , though he looks fifty . And Clarice has entered that long , pale , uncertain middle existence in which years behind you is not a faithful measure of life . Possibly she is thirty , but she is Herb 's wife , and that fact has made everything else  --  race , age , hopes  --  fade . " I'hev  | arc like retirees , and neither has gotten what he or she bargained for . When I look around , Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street . I offer his pretty little wife a little wave which she answers with a wave , and I go off hauling up the rear after Herb . " Okay now , Frank , what 's this bunch of lies supposed be about , " Icrb says gruffly as we whirl along . There is one more street of lined Capes  --  some with campers and boat trailers out front  --  then a wider artery road that leads back to the expressway , and beyond that is the lake , lined with small cottages owned mostly , I 'm sure , by people from the city  --  policemen , successful car salesmen , retired teachers . All are closed and shuttered for the winter . It is not a particularly nice place , a shabby summer community of unattractive bungalows . Not the neighborhood I 'd expected for an ex-all-pro . " I 've got my mind on an update on Herb Wallagher , Herb . How he 's doing , what 're his plans , how life 's treating him . Maybe a little inspirational business on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe a touch of optimism in the soup . " " All right , " Herb says . " Super . Super . " " I know readers would be interested in hearing about your job as spirit coach . Guys you played with taking their cue from you on going the extra half-mile . That kind of thing . " " I 'm not going to be doing that anymore , Frank , " I Ierb says grimly , pushing harder on his wheels . " I 'm planning to retire . " " Why so , IIerb ? " ( Not the best news for starters . ) " I just was n't getting the job done down there , Frank . " I'oo much bullshit involved . " An uneasy silence descends as we cross the road to Walled Lake . Most of the snow has melted here and only a gray crust remains on the shoulder where passersby have tossed their refuse . A hundred years ago , this country would 've been wooded and the lake splendid and beautiful . A perfect place for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and cars .  | Herb coasts on down the concrete boat ramp in between tww boarded-up and fenced-in cottages , and wheels furiously up onto the plank dock . Across Walled Lake is the expressway , and up the lakeside beyond the cottages a roller coaster track curves above the tree line . The Casino must 've been nearby , though I see no sign of it . " It 's funny , " Herb says , where he can see the lake from an elevation . " When I first saw you , you had a halo around your head . A big gold halo . Do you ever notice that , Frank ? " Herb whips his big head around and grins at me , then looks back at the empty lake . " I never have , Herb . " I take a seat on the pipe bannister that runs the length of the dock at the end of which two aluminum boats ride in the shallow water . " No ? " Herb says . " Well . " He pauses a moment in a reverie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , but does not look at me . " I 'm glad to be here , Herb . " " I get mad sometimes , Frank , you know ? God damn it . I just get boiling . " Herb suddenly whacks both his big open hands on the black armrests , and shakes his head . " What makes you mad , Herb ? " I have not taken a note yet , of course , nor have I touched my recorder , something I will need to do since I have a terrible memory . I am always too involved with things to pay strict attention . Though I feel like the interview has yet to get started . Herb and I are still getting to know each other on a personal level , and I 've found you can rush an interview and come away with such a distorted sense of a person that he could n't recognize himself in print  --  the first sign of a badly written story . " Do you have theories about art , Frank ? " Herb says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean do you , uh , have any fully developed concepts of , say , how what the artist sees relates to what is finally put on the canvas ? " " I guess not , " I say . " I like Winslow Homer a lot . " " All right . He 's a good one . He 's plenty good , " Herb says , and smiles a helpless smile up at me . " He 'd paint Walled Lake here , and it 'd feel and look pretty much like this , I think . "  | " . Maybe he would . " Herb looks away at the lake . " I low long did you play pro ball , Herb ? " " Eleven years , " Herb says moodily . " One in Canada . One in Chicago . Then they traded me over here . And I stayed . You know I 've been reading Ulysses Grant , Frank . " He nods profoundly . " When ( rant was dying , you know , he said , I think I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signifies to be ; to do ; to suffer . I signify all three . ' " Herb takes off his glasses and holds them in his big linesman 's fingers , examining their frames . His eyes are red . " That has some truth to it , Frank . But what the hell do you think he meant by that ? A verb ? " Herb looks up at me with a face full of worry . " I 've been worried about that for weeks . " " I could n't begin to say , Herb . Maybe he was taking stock . Sometimes we think things are more important than they are . " " That does n't sound good , though , does it ? " Herb looks back at his glasses . " It 's hard to say . " " Your halo 's gone now , Frank . You know it ? You 've become like the rest of the people . " " That 's okay , is n't it ? I do n't mind . " It 's pretty clear to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in all probability has missed out on a stabilizing pill . Possibly this is his gesture of straight-talk and soul-baring , but I do n't think it will make for a very good interview . Interviews always go better when athletes feel fairly certain about the world and are ready to comment on it . " I 'll just tell you what I think it means , " Herb says , narrowing his weakened eyes . " I think he thought he 'd just become an act . You understand that , Frank ? And that act was dying . " " I see . " " And that 's terrible to see things that way . Not to be but just to do . " " Well , that was just how Grant saw things , Herb . He had some other wrong ideas , too . Plenty of them . " " This is goddamn real life here , Frank . Get serious ! " Herb 's face struggles with the fiercest intensity , then just as promptly goes blank .  | " I was just reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhere else . Down the road , around the bend . h But this is it right here . " I lerb cracks his palms on his armrests again . " You know what I 'm getting at Frank ? " " I think so , Herb . I 'm trying . " " God damn it ! " Herb breathes a savage sigh . " You have n't even taken any notes yet . " " I keep it up here , Herb , " I say and give my head a poke . Herb stares up at me darkly . " You know what it 's like to lose the 1111 use of your legs , Frank ? " i " No I do n't , Herb . I guess that 's pretty obvious . " " Have you ever had someone close to you die ? " " Yes . " I could actually sec myself getting angry at Herb before this is over . " Okay , " Herb says . " Your legs go silent , Frank . I ca n't hear mine anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate there might be a hell of a lot more I do n't know about the world . People , of course , are always getting you all wrong . Because you come to interview them , they automatically think you 're just using them to confirm the store of what 's already known in the world . But where I 'm concerned , that could n't be wronger . It 's true I have expected a different Herb Wallagher from the l lerb Wallagher I 've found , a stouter , chin-out , better tempered kind of guy , a guy who 'd pick up the back of a compact car to help you out of a jam if he could . And what I found is someone who seems as dreamy as a barn owl . But the lesson is not new to me . You ca n't go into these thing thinking you know what ca n't be known . That ought to be rule one in every journalism class and textbook ; too much of life , even the life you think you should know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is major silence now that Herb has told me what it 's like not to have his legs to use . It is not an empty moment , not for me anyway , and I am not discouraged . I would still like to think there 's the possibility for a story here . Maybe by going off his medicine Herb will finally come hack to his senses with some unexpected and  | interesting ideas to bring up and end up talking a blue streak . That happens every day . " Do you ever miss playing football , Herb ? " I say , and smile hopefully . " What ? " Herb is drawn back from a muse the glassy lake has momentarily fostered . He looks at me as though he had never seen me before . I hear trucks pounding the interstate corridor to Lansing . The wind has wandered back now and a chill picks up off the black water . " Do you ever miss athletics ? " Herb stares at me reproachfully . " You 're an asshole , Frank , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't know me . " " That 's what I 'm doing here , Herb . I 'd like to get to know you and write a damn good story about you . Paint you as you are . Because I think that 's pretty interesting and complex in itself . " " You 're just an asshole , Frank , yep , and you 're not going to get any inspiration out of me . I dropped all that . I do n't have to do for anybody , and that means you . Especially you , you asshole . I do n't play ball anymore . " Herb plucks a piece of the toilet paper off his cheek and peers at it for blood . " I 'm ready to give up on inspiration , Herb . It was just a place to start . " " Do you want to hear the dream I have over and over ? " Herb rolls the paper between his fingers , then pushes himself out toward the end of the dock . I sit on the pipe bannister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like wings , his neck thin and rucked , his head yellowish and balding . I do not know if he knows where I am or not , or even where he is . " I 'd be glad to hear a dream , " I say . Herb stares off toward the lake as if it contained all his hopes gone cold . " I have a dream about these three old women in a stalled car on a dark road . Two of them arc taking their grandmother , who 's  | old , really old , back to a nursing home . Just someplace . Say New York state , or Pennsylvania . I come along in my Jeep  --  I had a Jeep once  --  and I stop and ask if I can help them . And they say yes . No one 's come by in a long time . And I can tell they 're worried about me . One woman has her money out to pay me before I even start . And they 've got this flat tire . I shine my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried old grandmother , her face low in the front seat . A chicken-wattle neck . The two other women stand with me while I change the tire . And as I 'm doing it I think about killing all three of them . Just strangling them with my hands , then driving off because no one would ever know who did it , since I was n't a killer or even known to be there . But I look around then , and I see these deer staring at me out of the trees . These yellow eyes . And that 's it . I wake up . " Herb twists his wheelchair and faces me . " How 's that for a dream ? Whaddaya think , Frank ? You 've got a halo again , by the way . It just came back . You look idiotic . " Herb suddenly breaks out in laughter , his whole body rumbling and his mouth wide as a canyon . Herb , I see , is as crazy as a betsey bug , and I want nothing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can . Interview or no interview . Inspiration or no inspiration . Interviewing a crazy man is a waste of anybody 's time who 's not crazy himself . And I 'm glad , in fact , that Herb is in his chair at the moment since it 's possible he would strangle me if he could . " It 's probably time we head back , Herb . " He has taken his glasses off and begun wiping them on his BIONIC shirt . But he is really still laughing . " Sure , okay . " " I 've got all I need for a good story . And it 's getting pretty chilly out here . " " You 're full of shit , Frank , " Herb says , smiling across the empty boat dock . On the lake a pair of ducks flies low across the surface , fast and slicing . They make an abrupt turn , then skin into the shiny water and become invisible . " Oh Frank , you 're really full of shit . " Herb shakes his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver chair while we make our way back up Glacier Way in silence . Everything has become  | confused , though why , exactly , I do n't know . It 's possible I 've had a bad effect on him . Sometimes when people realize sportswriters are just men or women they become resentful . ( People often want others to be better than they are themselves . ) But under these circumstances it is all but impossible to make a contribution , or to give an honest effort of any kind . It is , in fact , enough to make you want to hit the road for a pharmaceuticals house , of which New Jersey has plenty . " We did n't talk much about football , " Herb says thoughtfully . He is now as sane and reflective as an old sextant . " I guess it did n't seem it was much on your mind , Herb . " " It really seems insignificant now , Frank . It 's really a pretty crummy preparation for life , I 've come to believe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach to the people who played it . Perseverance . Team work . Comradeship . That kind of thing . " " Forget all that crap , Frank . I 've got the rest of my life handed to me if I can figure it out . I 've got some pretty big plans . Sports is just a memory to me . " " You mean law school and all that . " Herb nods at me like an undertaker . " That 's it . " " You 've got a lot of courage , Herb . It takes courage to be you , I think . " " Maybe , " Herb says , considering that idea . " Sometimes I 'm afraid , though , Frank . I 'll tell ya . Scared to death . " We 're just two guys jawing now . Just the way I 'd hoped . Maybe a straightforward oldfashioned interview could still be worked out . I feel for my tape recorder . " Sometimes I 'm afraid , Herb . It 's natural to the breed , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chuckles , nodding in forced agreement . I see Mr. Smallwood 's yellow Checker waiting out front of Herb 's house as we round the curve , his visit to Wixom apparently gone awry . It has grown colder since we 've been outside , and the sky has lowered . By nighttime it will be snowing to beat the band , and Vicki and I will be glad to be far from here . It is a strange turn of events ,  | not what I would 've expected , but I , on the other hand , am still not surprised . As we pass by , a man wearing a brown car coat comes out of his house , holding a can of motor oil . His is a house in the same architectural order as Herb 's , though with a room added on where the driveway once went into the back . The man stands beside his car  --  a new Olds with its hood up  --  and gives Herb a wave and a " howzi tgoin . " " Primo . Numero uno , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm as if he 's waving to a crowd . " This guy 's interviewing me . I 'm giving him a helluva time . " " Do n't take nobody 's crap , " the man shouts , and bends his short trunk under the murky hood of the Olds . " The neighbors still think I play on the team , " Herb says in a hushed voice , pushing himself up Glacier Way toward his wife and home . " flow 's that ? " " Well , I keep my injury pretty well a secret . Another guy plays in my place . With my number . I hope you wo n't write about that and ruin it . " " No way , Herb . You 've got my word on that . " Herb looks up at me as we approach Mr. Smallwood 's cab , and gives me a look full of wonder . " How come you do it , Frank . Tell the truth . " " How come I do what , Herb ? " Though I know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard time making his head be still . It 's wandering all around . " You could n't really like sports , Frank , " he says . " You do n't look like a guy who likes sports . " " I like some better than others . " It is not that uncommon a question , really . " But would n't you rather talk about something else ? " Herb shakes his big head , still wondrous . " What about Winslow Homer ? " " I 'd talk to you about him , Herb . Any time . Writing about something is a lot different from doing the thing itself . Does that clear  | anything up ? " For some reason my diaphragm , or its vicinity , feels like it is quaking again . " Pret-ty interesting , Frank . " herb nods at me with genuine admiration . " I 'm not sure it explains a goddamn thing , but it 's interesting . I 'll give you that . " " It 's pretty hard to explain your own life , Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though maybe not to Herb , for whom the whole world might quake all the time . He 's still having trouble keeping his head stationary . " I think I 've said enough . I 'm supposed to be asking you questions . " " I 'm a verb , Frank . Verbs do n't answer questions . " " Do n't think that way , Herb . " My diaphragm is crackling . Herb and I have not been together an hour , but there is a strong sense around him that he would like to strangle someone , and not be choosy whose neck he got his hands on . When you have spent so much of your life whamming into people and hurting them , it must be hard just to call a halt to it and sit down . It must be hard to do anything else , it seems to me , but keep on whamming . In any case , I 'm always most at ease when I know the way out . There is something to be avoided here , and I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a good story , Herb , " I say , inching toward the hack of Smallwood 's Checker . Clarice Wallagher has stepped out onto the front stoop and stands watching us . She calls Herb 's name and smiles wearily . This must happen to everyone : meetings ending in stunned silences out front ; a waiting cab ; Herb proclaiming himself a verb . My greatest admiration is her 's . I 'd hoped to have a word with her on the subject of Herb 's heroism-in-life , but that has gone past us . I simply hope there is a consolation for her late on dark nights . " Herb , " Clarice says in a pretty voice that cracks on the cold Michigan wind . " Okay ! " Herb shouts heroically . " Got ta go , Frank , got ta go . You ought a write my life story . You 'd make six figures . " We shake hands , and once again Herb tries to jerk me to my knees . There is an odd  | smell on Herb now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His cheek is bleeding from where he peeled off the paper . " I wanted you to see some old game films before you left . I could put the kebosh on ' em , Frank . Do n't let this chair fool ya . " " We 'll do it next time , Herb , that 's a promise . " Mr. Smallwood starts his cab with a loud whooshing and drops it into drive so that the body bucks half a foot forward . " I do n't know what happens sometimes , Frank . " Herb 's sad blue eyes suddenly fill with hot tears , and he shakes his big head to dash them away . It is the sadness of elusive life glimpsed and unfairly lost , and the following , lifelong contest with bitter facts . Pity , in other words , for himself , and as justly earned as a game ball . Only I do not want to feel it and wo n't . It is too close to regret to play fast and loose with . And the only thing worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reason I will not bend to it , will , in fact , go on to the bottom with my own ship . I take four quick steps back . " I 'm glad I met you , Herb . " Herb stares at me , his face distorted by unhappiness . " Yeah sure , " he says . And I am into the boxy , musty backseat of Mr. Smallwood 's Checker , and we shush off down Glacier Way without even so much as a goodbye to Clarice , leaving Herb sitting in the empty street , in his chair , waving goodbye to our tail lights , his sad face astream with helpless and literal tears .  | Mr. Smallwood is the best possible confederate for my circumstances . " You look like you could use a pick-me-up , " he says , once we are going , and hands back a bottle half out of its flimsy paper bag . I drink down a good gulp that makes me flubber my lips  --  it is peppermint and sweet as cough syrup , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second big gulp . " You musta had you a time , " Mr. Smallwood says as we hiss past the remnants of a long , charred building on the landward side of the lakefront road . A dismembered line of cabins stands opposite . The big building was once a Quonset hut with a barn built on behind , though snow is piled on its blackened interior timbers , one of which is a long bar . Grass has grown up . No one , apparently , has thought to find a new use for the land . My past in decomposition and trivial disarray . " These peoples out here 're cra-zy , " Mr. Smallwood announces widely , steering chauffer-style with one huge hand on the plastic steering knob , the other stretched over the seat back . " Sur-burban peoples , I 'm tellin you . Houses full of guns , everybody mad all the time . Ought a cool out , if you ask me . I ai n't been out here in years , could n't even figure out which street was which . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We pull up onto the expressway back toward Big D , invisible now in mossy green clouds that tell of snow and possibly a marooning storm . " Look here now . " Mr. Smallwood catches my eye in the rearview and leans backwards in his driver 's seat for a speculative stretch . " Flow much money you got ? " " Why ? " " Well , for a hundred dollars I could make a phone call up here at a gas station and the first thing you know , somebody be done made you feel a whole lot better . " Mr. Smallwood grins a big happy  | grin at the back seat , and I think for a moment about a hundred dollar whore , the kindness she might bring , like the pharmacy sending over an expensive prescription to get you through a rough night . A trip to the hot springs . Something wordless to patch the tissue of innocent words that holds life in its most positive attitude . Too much serious talk and self-explanation and you 're a goner . What Herb needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strap on a set of pads and beat the daylights out of somebody and quit worrying about theories of art . He is a man without a sport , when a sport is exactly what he needs . With better luck we might 've summoned up a vivider memory of his playing days , seen the game films . Herb could get back within himself , shake off alienation and dreary doubt , and play through pain  --  be the inspiration he was put on earth to be . I tell Mr. Smallwood no thanks , and he chuckles in a mirthfulderisive way . Then for a while we wind back toward town without speaking , taking the Lodge this time since the snow is off and the traffic gone north , leaving the expressway gray and wintry . Across from Tiger Stadium , Mr. Smallwood stops at a liquor store owned , he says , by his brother-in-law , a little Fort Knox of steel mesh and heavy bullet-proof glass . Across the avenue the big stadium hulks up white and lifeless . A message on its marquee says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Smallwood ambles across and buys another pint bottle of schnapps , which I insist on paying for , and he and 1 treat ourselves to a warm elevation of spirits on the short trip down to the Pontchartrain . He says he is a Tiger fan and that he believes it 's time for a dynasty . He also tells me that his parents moved up from Magnolia , Arkansas , in the Forties , and that for a while he attended Wayne State before he got married and went to work at Dodge Main . He quit that last year , he says , a jump ahead of the lay-offs , and bought his taxi . And he is happy to name his own hours now and to go home every day at noon for lunch with his wife and to rest an hour before getting back onto the street for the afternoon rush . Someday he hopes to retire to Arkansas . He does n't ask me  | about myself , either too courteous or too engaged in his own interesting life of work and discretionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be easy to envy if you did n't have one just as good . I calculate him to be not much older than I am . At the hotel Mr. Smallwood leans across the seat to where he can see me out on the windy pavement putting money back in my wallet . For an insant I think he means to shake my hand , but that is not on his mind at all . I have already paid him our agreed fare , and the schnapps bottle is on the floor beside his considerable leg . My gift to him . " There 's a good chop house down on Larned , " he says in a tour guide 's voice and with a grin that makes me wonder if he is n't making fun of me . " Steaks big as this . " He holds two big chunky fingers two full inches apart . " You can walk from here . It 's safe . I take the wife now and then . You can drink some wine , have a good time . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation Swede , and I understand he is n't making fun of me at all , only trying to be a good ambassador for his city , putting on the voice he has learned for it . " That 's great , " I say , not quite hearing all this insider 's dining advice , turning an ear instead into the windy sibilance of the city air . Snow flakes are falling now . " Come on back when the weather 's nicer , " he says . " You 'll like it a whole lot better . " " When will that be ? " I smile , giving him the old Michigan straight line . " Ten minutes maybe . " He cracks a big wisecracker 's grin , the same as his hundred-dollar-whore grin . And with the slap-shut of the yellow door , he shoots off down the street , leaving me at the hissing curbside as solitary as a lonely end . Though not for long . Back in the room , the TV is on without sound . The drapery is drawn and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a jaybird on the rumpled bed , drinking a 7-Up and reading the in-  | flight magazine . Air in the room is hot and close , changed from the sleep-soft night smell . Only the sad old familiarity from the dreamy days after Ralph died is left : lost in strangerville with a girl I do n't know well enough and ca n't figure how to revive an interest in ( or , for her sake , an interest in me that would compensate ) . It is a tinny , minor-key feeling , a far-flung longing for conviction among the convictionless . " I 'm sure glad to see you , " she says , giving me a happy smile in the blinky TV light . I stand in the little dark entryway , my two feet heavy as anchors , and I ca n't help thinking of my life as a scene in some steamy bus station novel . Big Sledge moved toward the girl catquick , trapping her where he 'd wanted her , between his cheap drifter 's suitcase and the pile of greasy tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would see what 's what . They both would . " How 'd everything work out with your old football guy ? " " Dandy . " I go to the window , pull back the heavy curtain and look out . Snow is dazzling an inch from my face , falling in burly flakes onto Jefferson Avenue . The river is lost in white , as is Cobo . In the street , flashing yellow beacons signal the first snowplows . I feel I can hear their skid and clatter , but I 'm sure I do not . " I do n't like the looks of this weather . We might have to change our plans . " " A-Okay , " she says . " I 'm just happy to be here today with you . I can go to the aquarium someplace else . They must be alike . " She sets her 7-Up on her bare belly and stares at it , thinking . " I wanted this to be a nice vacation for you , though . I had a lot of plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a plenty good time . I ordered beer-batter shrimp up here , which was a meal in itself . I put on my clothes and went downstairs and looked in the shops which 're nice , though they 're like Dallas 's in a lot of similar ways . I think I might 've seen Paul Anka , but I 'm not sure . He 's about half the size I thought he 'd be if it was him , and I already knew he was tiny . " I sit in the chair beside the coffee table . Her uncovered beauty is unexpectedly what I need to make the transition back ( the familiar  | can still surprise and should ) . Hers is an altogether ordinary nakedness , a sleek curve of bust , a plump darkening thigh tapered to a dainty ankle , a willing smile of no particular intention  --  all in all , a nice bundle for a lonely fellow to call his in a strange city when time 's to kill . On television the face of a pallid newsman is working dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff is the God 's truth . It 's what you want . " Do you believe women and men can just be friends , " Vicki says . " I guess so , " I say , " once the razzle-dazzle 's over . I like the razzledazzle though . " " Yeah , me too . " Her smile broadens and she crosses her arms over her soft breasts . She has , I can tell , been captured by a thought , an event she likes and wants to share . At heart she could not be kinder and could make someone the most rewarding wife . Only for some reason it does not seem as likely to be me as it once did . She may have caught this very mood in the wind today and be as puzzled by it as I am . Though she is nobody 's fool . " I called Everett on the phone , " she says , and looks down at her knees , which are bent Well . I used mine , anyway . " " How is old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett and can be as chummy as a barber with the far-off idea of him . " He 's okay . He 's into Alaska now . He said people need carpets up there . He also said he 's shaved his head bald as a cue ball . I told him I was in a big suite , looking out at a renaissance center . I did n't say where . " " What 'd he think about that . " " As the world turns , ' is what he said , which is about standard . He wanted to know would I send him back his stereo I got in the divorce . Everything 's sky high up there , I guess , and if you come with all you need , you start ahead . " " Did he want you to go with him ? "  | " No , he did not . And I would n't either . You do n't have to marry somebody like Everett but once in a lifetime . Twice 'll kill you . He 's got some ole gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did he want , then ? " " I called him , remember . " She frowns at me . " He did n't want anything . Have n't you ever got the phonies in your life ? " " Only when I 'm lonesome , sweetheart . I did n't think you were lonesome . " " Right , " she says and looks at the silent television . Detroit , I can see now , has not affected her exactly as I had hoped , and she has become wary . Of what ? Possibly in the lobby she saw someone who reminded her too much of herself ( that can happen to inexperienced travelers ) . Or worse . That no one there reminded her of anyone she ever knew . Both can be threatening to a good frame of mind and usher in a gloomy remoteness . Though calling up an old lover or husband can be the perfect antidote . " I'hey always remind you of where you 've been and where you think you 're going . And if you 're lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , in a snowstorm  --  can seem like the right place on the planet . Though I 'm not certain Vicki has been so lucky . She may have 1 ii found an old flame burning and not know what do about it . " Do you feel like you wanted to be friends with Everett ? " I start with the most innocent of questions and work toward the most sensitive . " No-ho way . " She reaches down and pulls the sheet up over her . She is even warier now . It may be she wants to tell me something and ca n't quite find the words . But if I 'm to be relegated to the trash heap of friendship , I want to do a friend 's one duty : let her be herself . Though I 'd be happier to snuggle up under the sheets and rassle around till plane time . " Did you hang up feeling like you wanted to be friends with me ? " I say , and smile at her . Vicki turns over on the big bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under her chin and the crisp hotel percale stretched over her like a winding . I have hit the tender spot . A day and a  | night with me has made even Everett look good . Something else is needed , and I do n't fit the bill even with champers , a demi-suite , bachelor buttons and a view of Canada . Maybe that is n't even surprising when you come down to it , since by scaling down my own pleasures I may have sold short her hopes for herself . I , however , am an expert in taking things like this lying down . For writers ? even sportswriters  --  bad news is always easier than good , since it is , after all , more familiar . " I do n't want to be friends . Not just , " Vicki says in a tiny , mouse voice from a mound of white covers . " I really thought I was gettin a new start with you . " " Well , what happened to make you think you were n't ? Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoot . That did n't matter , " she says , smally . " Live and let die , I say . You ca n't help yourself . Yesterday was n't the tiptop day for you in the year . " " Then , what 's the matter ? " I wonder , in fact , how many times I have said that or something equal to it to a woman passing palely through my life . What 're you thinking ? What 's made you so quiet ? You seem suddenly different . What 's the matter ? Love me is what this means , of course . Or at least , second best : surrender . Or at the very least , take some time regaling me with why you wo n't , and maybe by the end you will . Outside a wind makes a sharp oceanic woo around the corner of the hotel , then off into the cold , paltry Detroit afternoon . By five it could as easily turn to rain , by six the stars could be out and by nighttime Vicki and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chop . You can never completely count on things out here . Life is counterpoised against a mean wind that could suddenly cease . " Well , " Vicki says , and turns over to face me out of a grotto of pillows and sheets . " When I went downstairs , you know , when you were gone ? I just went to be a part of something . I did n't need anything . And I went in the little newsstand down there , and I picked up this paperback . How To Take On The World , by Doctor Barton . Because I felt like I was starting over in one way , like I said .  | You and me . So I stood there at the rack and read one chapter called Our New-Agers . ' Which was about these people who wo n't eat potato chips and who join these self-discovery groups , and drink mineral water and have literary discussions every day . People that think it ought a be easy to express their feelings and be how you seem . And I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was someplace way off the beam . Back with the potato chips and people who are n't inner-looking . Here we 'd come all the way out here , and all I could do was eat shrimp and watch TV and cry . And it was n't working out . So I thought maybe we could be friends if you wanted to . I called up Everett because I knew I could bring it off with him and quit crying . I knew I was better off than him . " A big handsome tear leaves her eye , goes off her nose and vanishes into the pillow . I have managed to make two different people cry inside of two hours . I am doing something wrong . Though what ? Cynicism . I have become more cynical than old lago , since there is no cynicism like lifelong self-love and the tunnel vision in which you yourself are all that 's visible at the tunnel 's end . It 's embarrassing . Likewise , there 's nothing guaranteed to make people feel more worthless than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not . A cynical " New-Alter " is exactly me , a sad introspecter and potato chip avoider with a queasy heart-to-heart mentality ? though I would give the crown jewels not to be , or at least not be thought to be . My only hope now is to deny everything  --  friendship , disillusionment , embarrassment , the future , the past  --  and make my stand for the present . If I can hold her close in this cold-hot afternoon , kiss her and hug away her worries with ardor , so that when the sun is down and the wind stops and a spring evening draws us , maybe I will love her after all , and she me , and all this will just have been the result of too little sleep in a strange town , schnapps and Herb . " I 'm not really a New-Ager , " I say and take a seat on the bed shoulder , where I can touch her cheek , warm as a baby 's . " I 'm just  | an old-fashioned Joe who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's late at night , and I had you in my old-fashioned arms to love . " " Oh my . " She puts a tentative hand on my shoulder and gives it a friendly pat . " I bet you think I got it all wrong . " She gives a stout sniff . " That I ca n't even make myself miserable and do it right . " " You 're just no good at messin up . " I put a heavy hand on her soft breast . " You just have to let good things be good if they will . Do n't worry about more than you have to . " " I should n't read , is what it is . It always gets me in trouble . " She reaches both hands around my neck and pulls hard , so hard once again a crippling pain goes down my back clear to my buttocks . " Oh , " I say , involuntarily . On TV a skier is just about to push out the timer gate onto a slope longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling wherever he is . I would n't do what he 's doing for a million dollars . " Oh my , " she says , for I have found her in the lemony light . " My , my , my . " " You sweet girl , " I say . " Who would n't love you ? " Outside in the cold city the wind goes woo again and I can , I think , hear the tufted snow dashing against the window , sending shivers through every soul in Detroit who thinks he knows a thing or two and who is willing to bet his life on it . I leave the TV on , since even now , in its prying presence , I still find it consoling . By five o'clock , we have taken a cab trip up Jefferson to the Belle Isle Botanical Garden , and are back in the room suffering a case of the wall-stare willies , something sportswriters know a lot about . We are like the family of a traveling salesman , come along for the adventure and diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill while business gets conducted ; too many unfamiliar streets leading too far away ; too little going on in the hotel lobby to make people-watching all that rewarding . The Botanical Garden turned out to be cold and alien-feeling
