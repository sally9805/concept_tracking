The recess began on Aug. 5 ; Congress is scheduled to be back in session on Sept. 9 . <> <> Little Time for Honeymoon // In his continuing effort to take a belated honeymoon , Representative Charles E.

Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut : He is on vacation . " He has been in public office for seven years and has had every hour of every day scheduled , " said Marla Romash , his press secretary . " He said he just didn ' t want to have a schedule . He is spending the time with his family . For seven years , he ' s never had more than two days in a row off.

At the request of the State Department , Representative Leo C. Zefferetti , Democrat of Brooklyn , is headed to Peru in his role as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Drug Abuse . Peru and the United States are about to reach agreement on how to compensate Peruvian farmers whose chief crop is the coca leaf , the source of cocaine .
