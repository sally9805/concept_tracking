Reagan gets a sunny welcome from an old opponent <P> While President Carter confronted Ted Kennedy at the White House , a much more amiable encounter reunited the two most eminent figures in the G.O.P. They had never been friends , and as recently as last March , Gerald Ford had described Ronald Reagan as " unelectable . " But as they strolled out of their meeting near the 13th hole of the Thunderbird Country Club in Palm Springs last week , Ronnie and Jerry looked as if they had been lifelong pals . Smiling and relaxed in a blue blazer and beige slacks , Ford called the talks " very , very constructive . " Said he : " We are establishing a relationship that is vitally important . I pledge myself to campaign wholeheartedly . " <P> During their meeting , Ford urged Reagan to concentrate on three key issues : unemployment , weak national defense and the vagaries of Carter 's foreign policy . About that charge of Reagan 's being unelectable , Ford said he changed his mind when the economic news grew worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his earlier views . Reagan did not quite accept that . He said that changes had occurred in the " perception of my viewpoints rather than my viewpoints themselves . " <P> Much of the interest in the Reagan-Ford meeting had been aroused by reports that the two could be persuaded to join forces on the G.O.P. ticket , but Ford firmly ruled himself out as a possible vice-presidential candidate . He gave as his reason the constitutional obstacle against the President and Vice President living in the same state : namely , California . Accepting the No. 2 spot , said Ford , would create a " problem of such magnitude that I would n't even consider it . " To take up residence elsewhere would be a " phony operation . " <P> Ford faced other problems as well . At 66 , he is only three years younger than Reagan and could not very easily be considered a successor . Moreover , he does not want to get bogged down again in the minutiae of government . Explains an aide : " He wants to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not want to get involved in water projects . " <P> With Ford out of the running , Howard Baker remains a top contender for the vice presidency , but a certain amount of opposition to him is building . While his skilled performance as Senate minority leader has won him the plaudits of G.O.P. moderates and even Democrats , he remains unacceptable to much of his party 's right wing because of his support of the Panama Canal treaties and federal funding for abortions . <P> George Bush , though considered a weak campaigner by some Reagan advisers , does not arouse the same degree of animosity among the party 's right wing . He would be grudgingly accepted by them , and he demonstrated popularity in the big states during the primaries . Ford is expected to support Bush , who was his CIA director .
