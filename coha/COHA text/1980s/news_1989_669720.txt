You see friends you grew up with establishing themselves respectably and comfortably in law , medicine , academia , finance , and business endeavors . You , by way of contrast , may live in a state of perennial uncertainty , never really knowing if what you are doing is valid and useful . And unless you are independently well heeled , or in league with people who are , frequently you must take any kind of work you can find to keep things together. // // Or have times and values changed ? // From what I ' ve absorbed over the past 25 years or more as a writer and artist , increasingly the art being produced and exhibited , and the novels being written and published , are coming from people for whom literature and the visual arts are secondary or supplementary pursuits - from teachers , lawyers , doctors , engineers , architects , and so forth. // Less and less do you find an exhibition of art or a work of fiction from someone who is committed exclusively to those disciplines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a visual artist , to the degree that their creative expression alone determines whether they succeed or fail in the world of work. // It ' s been argued convincingly that it was ever thus : that over the centuries writers and artists have been , at the same time , soldiers , civil servants , clergymen , members of the nobility , academics . True enough . The question that persists though , is , were they the ones who produced the world ' s great art - or has the most enduring art come from the relatively few who knew no safety nets , no assurances , no compromise ? // What got me pondering all of this was a meeting I had a little over a year ago with Paterson Ewen , a Canadian artist , who had hit the headlines as a result of two major exhibitions of his work , which were crossing the country at the same time . Until then he was little known outside a small circle of serious artists and domestic art connoisseurs , although he had been painting earnestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises from a complete immersion in art , for most of his adult life. // Suddenly here he was , nearing what was considered retirement age , being hailed in the press as an unearthed genius. // In 1946 , when he returned from overseas service in the Canadian Army , Ewen had thoughts of becoming a geologist . He was 23 years old , and he enrolled in the bachelor of arts program at McGill University , in Montreal , with studies in science , mathematics , and geology. // Within a year , however - partly because of a lingering interest in art from his childhood days , and the vitality of Montreal ' s artistic community - he transferred to the university ' s fine-arts program . From then on art gradually was to take over his life. // Ewen next studied at the school of art and design at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts , where two artists of distinction , Arthur Lismer and Goodridge Roberts , took him in hand. // The influences skidding around Montreal at the time were those of Cezanne , Matisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted by Montreal ' s Plasticiens group , and Surrealism also influenced him , along with the work and theories of the devoutly Canadian Group of Seven and the fledgling American Abstract Expressionists . Among the most talked-about French Canadian artists on the scene were Paul-Emile Bordaus and Jean-Paul Riopelle. // For years Ewen slaved at art , in the shadow of greater names . His paintings were shown in solo and group exhibitions , essentially on the home front , although in New York on a couple of occasions , and once with a Canadian group in Italy . He didn ' t go entirely unheeded by art critics and connoisseurs , but neither was he considered to be anywhere near the forefront of Canadian art. // To keep himself , and eventually a wife and four sons , in food , shelter , and clothing , Ewen worked in a hat factory , sold rugs in a department store , peddled insurance , and did part-time work for a provincial government rent-control board . His longest stint as a salaried employee was 10 years as a company personnel manager. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , while living in Toronto , that Paterson Ewen made his breakthrough . He was working at an idea for a woodcut , in 18th-century Japanese tradition , when it dawned on him that gouged wood could be a more powerful art form than prints taken from it . So he began a series of hand-chiseled paintings. // Gouging with an electric router soon followed . His materials became sheets of plywood , as large as 92 by 132 inches , acrylics , and at times strips of galvanized iron , chain , matting , linoleum , and string. // And with those materials he found himself giving expression to his early interest in natural phenomena - ' ' how rain falls , and how lightning works , clouds , eclipses , and waves , ' ' as he explained to an interviewer in 1975. // Even at that , it was another 17 years before Ewen gained wide attention on the Canadian art scene. // I ' ve known , worked with , and written about scores of artists over the years , but none more than Paterson Ewen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why , I must return to the day of my first and only meeting with him in January 1988. // We met at his home and studio , at that time located in a medium-size city ' s east end , behind a taxicab stand , on a grim stretch of a main , east-west thoroughfare . Inoffensive graffiti decorated the whitewashed exterior wall around the warehouse door . Inside was a chilly , sparsely furnished space that served as Ewen ' s sitting room ; behind it , the open warehouse area , warm as toast , because the hot-air ducts coursed through it . Near the center of that warehouse floor , a bare mattress ; leaning against the wall facing me , a huge , gouged plywood work of art. // For close to 40 years Ewen had given his all to art , and it had left him , in material terms , with little more than that - rented warehouse space in which to live and work , the tools and supplies of his trade , the bare necessities . Only months before had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication , self-deprivation , and abiding uncertainty. // A great many people , in all walks of life , do a lot of acceptable art and write well-received books . But to achieve anything of lasting significance in the arts , doesn ' t it require a colossal drive to learn and understand as much as possible about the discipline , and an almost inordinate capacity for self-sacrifice - and valor , and indomitability of spirit ? // //
