The man on the shore was Patricio Aylwin , the Christian Democrat leading a 17-party alliance who is a strong frontrunner in what will be Chile ' s first presidential elections in 19 years . On Dec. 14 , voters will choose the successor to Gen. Augusto Pinochet , who lost his bid to retain power in a plebiscite last October. // But despite the cartoon ' s suggestion that an Aylwin presidency might lead to hard times , economic advisers to Mr. Aylwin say the last thing they intend to do is damage the successful free-market economy fostered by the Pinochet Government. // // Responding to Pent-Up Demand // " We are going to produce change with stability , " promised Alejandro Foxley , who runs Mr. Aylwin ' s economic team and is expected to become Minister of Finance if he wins. // Mr. Foxley , 50 years old , has a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin and is president of an economic research institute here and holder of an endowed chair in economics at the University of Notre Dame. // The Aylwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pent-up demand for improvements in the lives of the poorer half of the population , and that to do this they will raise income and corporate taxes , as well as seek international aid. // The Aylwin camp is conscious , however , of the economic instability afflicting most of South America , and of the economic traumas that were a major factor in the interruption in Chilean democracy 16 years ago , when the armed forces led by General Pinochet overthrew the Socialist President , Salvador Allende Gossens . Mr. Foxley says an Aylwin government would have no intention of changing the prevailing economic rules . <> <> Unity Is a Major Challenge // " Democracy can not totally frustrate the aspirations and hopes of people , " he said . " At the same time , we have a well-functioning economy and our task will be to maintain economic growth at 4 or 5 percent a year . We will have to increase social expenditures without increasing the fiscal deficit. " // One challenge to bringing this about is whether Socialists and Christian Democrats can work together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal differences. // The Christian Democrats and the Socialists were on opposite sides when the Allende Government went down in the midst of near-economic anarchy on Sept. 11 , 1973 . Much of the country was opposing factory and farm takeovers and other attempts at state control , shortages were widespread and annual inflation approached four digits. // President Allende died in the presidential palace , which was under bombardment by the armed forces . His death was a suicide in the view of researchers and many of his fellow Socialists today , although many Allende supporters contended that he had been slain . <> <> Finding Common Ground // Dr. Allende , whose Government was a coalition of Socialists , Communists and several smaller parties , had failed to get a majority of the popular vote in 1970 and became President only with the support of the Christian Democrats in the congressional runoff. // But the Christian Democrats subsequently moved into open opposition to Dr. Allende , and some senior Christian Democrats , including Mr. Aylwin , appeared to support the coup. // It has taken years of discussions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in opposing General Pinochet and preparing a future government. // At the same time , one Socialist faction , led by Ricardo Lagos , has moved toward social democracy . The other main faction , led by Clodomiro Almeyda , is officially Marxist-Leninist , but it has distanced itself from the Communist Party and says it has set aside its economic goals for now in the interest of achieving political democracy. // " The Socialists in this country know they have to prove that they can govern without producing severe economic problems , " said Mr. Foxley , a Christian Democrat , " and they are willing to go along with moderate policies . " <> <> ' Question of Survival ' // Sergio Bitar , who was Minister of Mining at the end of the Allende Government and spent 13 months as a political prisoner after the coup , says that for the Socialists much more than economic policy is now at stake. // " For us , the imbalance of economic factors in the Allende period is related to pain and death , not just to the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the economy was a factor that facilitated the coup. " // " For us , " he added , " inflation is not a question of numbers . It ' s a question of survival. " // Mr. Bitar , a Harvard graduate who calls himself a " pragmatic socialist , " is considered a possible member of the future government . He has taken an active role with Mr. Foxley and others in convincing businessmen , bankers and foreign investors that democracy will not be bad for the economy . <> <> An Open , Low-Tariff Economy // The economic team led by Mr. Foxley produced an outline of economic policy and principles that commits an Aylwin government to an open , low-tariff economy without price controls. // It also suggests there will be more government direction of the economy , particularly to promote industrialization , than has been the practice of recent years. // This has brought criticism from departing Government economists and some business leaders , who see it as statist in philosophy and think the increased corporate taxes will discourage investment. // However , Fernando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s chief opponent , former Finance Minister Hernan Buchi , said he was not frightened by the Aylwin economic plan. // Mr. Leniz said he was encouraged by the fact that " for the first time in Chile both sides are offering an economic policy in a modern framework. " // He said that , on balance , the parameters of the debate over economic policy today in Chile seemed no broader than those " between , say , Republicans and Democrats. " //
