My first visit to Nicaragua since the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza , my uncle , was three years ago , shortly after the victory of the Sandinists . ....... I went to attend the funeral of my brother Marcel , at the age of 24 a Sandinist militant like most of his peers and in spite of his family origins : nothing unusual in Nicaragua . His death has never been fully clarified . The Sandinists claim he was killed by someone who believed he had betrayed his class ; the Somocistas argue his murder was masterminded by the Sandinists because he was Somoza 's nephew . This summer 1 returned , and I was confronted with news of other murders and many more questions begging for answers . My arrival in Managua coincided with the celebration of the Sandinist revolution 's third anniversary . Despite the slogans , the omnipresent revolutionary messages and the posters everywhere , it was obvious that the infatuation with the Sandinists had lost its romantic momentum . Indeed , how long can promises of a " new , free " Nicaragua suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaraguans who expected the ouster of the tyrannical Somoza regime to bring better times and a more democratic government , the past three years have been somewhat of a disappointment . The situation in Nicaragua is bleak . The Sandinist government has been unable to establish a coherent system capable of fulfilling its democratic principles or to make far-reaching structural changes . It has not solved the country 's severe economic problems and probably can not without significant outside help . And it is now being threatened with a massive invasion from its northern neighbor , Honduras , actively supported by what some Sandinists refer to as " the big enemy of mankind , " the United States . Still , there are many Nicaraguans who know revolutions can not accomplish miracles . " Now things are bad , " I was told by Gerardo , an 85-year-old peasant who lives on a state-owned farm , El Canon , a few miles from the capital . " But later , in the future , they will get better , much better . We may not get to see the good times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching events in Nicaragua with interest is Cuba . It has seized the opportunity to show companerismo ( camaraderie ) by sending Nicaragua doctors , technicians and other professionals  --  and , some say , about 100 military advisers . In return , the Sandinists are beginning to show an open admiration for the Castro regime . Still , despite a pattern that appears to be pointing away from democracy , Nicaragua has not been lost to a Cuban model of communism  --  yet . True , like all revolutionary countries , it accepts help from wherever it comes . True , too , a handful of former junta members and thousands of professionals have fled and are organizing a coalition in exile . But there are still many critics of the regime operating in Nicaragua and challenging those in power . And though there have been excesses by the government  --  including the recent arrest of a number of businesspeople and an attempt to undermine the authority of the Catholic Church by sponsoring a so-called " People 's Church " ? Nicaragua has proved to be more respectful of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fact the Reagan Administration should have kept in mind before launching its overt and covert actions against the Sandinists . The threat of a U.S.-inspired invasion from Honduras is not a device used by the Sandinists to distract the Nicaraguan people from the country 's domestic problems , as some critics have claimed . Constant harassment and border-crossing forays by troops trained by the United States ( and financed with part of the $20.6 million U.S. military handout to Honduras ) are real . Nicaraguan military commanders have located at least nine guerrilla bases in Honduras . Light planes equipped with bombs and rockets recently fired at gas storage tanks in the port of Corinto . The American press has revealed plans for a $19 million covert C.I.A . operation to train Somocistas to invade Nicaragua , and perhaps it is no coincidence that what once were sporadic antigovernment demonstrations in Managua have become recurring sabotage attacks , mortar shellings and armed raids on Nicaraguan villages . " The aggressions sponsored by the United States are obviously on the rise , " Sandinist leader Rene Vivas , a viceminister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington is " arming Somoza 's people , putting pressure on Honduras , instigating , training and offering logistical support to the right-wing insurgents . " Vivas and other Sandinist leaders reiterated that it is the pattern of organized violence during the past four months that has forced the revolution to adopt extreme measures , such as extending the thirty-day state of emergency declared in March for another six months . Though moderation was among the Sandinists ' initial goals , this threat from the Honduran border is forcing the revolutionary regime to increase its army and acquire sophisticated weapons . Even so , the Sandinists realize their army could never compete with the U.S.-supplied Honduran Air Force . The Nicaraguan Air Force has four helicopters and two training jets ; MIG jets are expected to arrive in 1983 from the Soviet Union , according to a foreign diplomat in Managua , but may be too late to be of any use . For top Sandinist leaders  --  as for many others , shopkeepers and peasants alike  --  the issue is not whether an invasion will take place but rather what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has increased the number of militia members and reservists to 80,000 and 25,000 respectively , although the civil defense groups lack experience in conventional warfare . Vivas seemed convinced that " everyone is willing to fight if they have to , " but most people I spoke to would rather not participate in another civil war . " We 've had enough of that , " said one Nicaraguan . " Ours may not be the best revolution the world has invented , but it is ours and we 'd like to get on with the business of seeing it progress . " Asked if he would join the Sandinist militia in the event of an invasion , he said , " I am praying I wo n't have to , " adding that perhaps the United States " will change its attitude and re-establish an open dialogue . " At times , it seems as if everyone who has chosen to stay in Nicaragua ( including Sandinist militants , civilians holding important jobs and even those businesspeople a touch disappointed with the revolution ) is willing to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were a newborn baby that had to be taken care of . Some even go as far as defending all government decisions , at least in public , out of a belief that it is essential to be " tough " in order to safeguard Nicaragua 's " new independence . " This was the general attitude last winter , when a series of border confrontations provoked the forced relocation of about 10,000 Miskito Indians from their ancestral lands along the Coco River , near the Honduran frontier . The Sandinists said the relocation was an attempt to incorporate the Indians into the " new Nicaragua . " But , as people who had remained isolated from the mainstream of Nicaraguan society , the Miskitos did n't like being resettled . Some reacted violently to what they regarded as an imposition on their lives . A few joined the insurgents in Honduras ; others ended up in Nicaraguan jails . The government was criticized for its rough treatment in the resettlement , but Sandinist leaders argued they were only " trying to prevent terrorist activity from proliferating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  constantly on the alert , " said Luis Fiallos , the vice minister in charge of forestry and therefore a regular visitor to Nicaragua 's wooded north . " If we did n't feel that our revolution was being threatened by a huge U.S. - backed invasion coming from Honduran territory , we would n't have taken certain measures toward the Miskitos , " he added . Foreign journalists have virtually no access to that region , but I was able to join a team of local reporters at a ceremony there presided over by Interior Minister Tomas Borge Martinez in late July . He distributed land titles to about 600 Miskitos and , in their Indian dialect , said : " Our government considers you Nicaraguans , and as such , Sandinists . We want to protect you and bring you closer to us ; we want to learn your culture and understand your ways . " In addition to its land-distribution program for the Miskitos , the government can point to other significant achievements . Its literacy crusade has reduced the illiteracy rate nationwide from 50.3 percent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The health budget stands at $218.3 million , up from the $26.4 million that the Somoza dictatorship allocated . More than 6,000 peasant families have obtained land titles and there are now more than 3,000 agricultural cooperatives , as against 130 during Soinoza 's reign . Still , there are those who dare to say , at least privately , " We were better off with Somoza , as much as we hated him . " It would be a mistake to think the Nicaraguan people want the Somocistas back in power  --  in fact , if there is anything all Nicai aguans agree on it is their deep hatred for Somoza and particularly his National Guard  --  but there were indeed " golden days " during his dynasty that some remember with nostalgia . Thanks to high prices for cotton , sugar and coffee , and a cordial relationship with the United States , Nicaragua 's wealthy sectors received large amounts of foreign income ; between 1961 and 1977 , its foreign trade earnings increased from $63 million to $637 million . Today , prices for exports and foreign financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reconstruction Fund , $30 million of the $75 million in loans approved under the Carter Administration have been stopped . Within weeks of coming to power , the Reagan Administration suspended all U.S. assistance to Nicaragua , including credits to purchase U.S. wheat . As a result , Nicaragua 's total foreign income has averaged $471 million a year since the revolution . Daniel Ortega Saavedra , the ranking member of the Sandinist junta , has complained that " the rich countries are paying us less and less " while inflation forces import prices higher and higher : " A tractor that cost $15,000 ten years ago costs $35,000 today . " Some of Nicaragua 's economic difficulties may be of its own making . After a recent flood that destroyed roads , bridges and most crops , causing damages estimated at $400 million , the Sandinists at least temporarily rejected an A.I.D . offer of $5.1 million that was made as " a symbol of political and moral support " to the private sector and the Catholic Church . Edmundo Jarquin , director of the Reconstruction Fund , labeled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously affected by the flood . Some Nicaraguans loyal to the government believe it can compromise . " We should n't let politics stand in the way and let the $5.1 million go to waste , " said Mary-Jane Mulligan , director of private-sector development at the Ministry of Industry . " The state does not object to it being invested in the private sector ; it objects to being told by a foreign group what to do with the money . " She feels the Sandinists should " find a way of negotiating between the private sector and the state " to accept the $5.1 million . Although Jarquin has said that the loan has not been rejected " in a final statement " and that " a door has been left open " to negotiations , his written response to A.I.D . objecting to the loan as " a political statement " was firm : " The A.I.D . decision is incongruent with the politics of our government in what concerns international cooperation , which states that loans should be granted in accordance with the needs of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise , who asked to remain unidentified , the Sandinist regime 's proud attitude toward the A.I.D . loan is proof that it no longer stands by its initial commitment to a mixed economy . Perhaps A.I.D . did disregard Nicaragua 's most urgent needs , he said , but " rejecting the loan was obviously an attempt to stop the private sector from growing . " Arguing that many private enterprises have been shut down for no apparent reason , he insisted that Sandinist leaders al e showing less and less interest in the private sector 's growth . Too many businesspeople and professionals have been allowed to leave Nicaragua , he said , and " most Sandinist party members or sympathizers are amateurs in business and managing skills . It is only natural that the industrial and private sectors are not thriving under this new regime . " Commander Ortega Saavedra , however , sees things differently . " We inherited an industrial sector in decline , which was profitable in the 1960s but now could only subsist at the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in a recent speech . Because of the high production costs of some private enterprises , he added , " in the long run it is preferable to import than to produce here . " In a recent interview , Jaime Wheelock , a Sandinist commander and the Minister of Agrarian Reform , denied that the principle of a mixed economy had been " betrayed . " The state controls only a third of Nicaragua 's economy , he said , and " our tendency is not to expand or to confiscate more land but rather to make what we already have be more productive . " In what might have been too optimistic a statement , Wheelock maintained that " the thriving state-controlled sector , the private cattle-raising sector and the increasingly productive peasant cooperatives are working in a positive and harmonious atmosphere . " According to Wheelock , not only are some " rich landowners " cooperating with the revolution but some private businesses have accepted the state 's " favorable credit and price policies . " An , example of the regime 's loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cotton policy : " Last year , 100 kilograms of cotton cost $95 in the international market . This year , the price went down to $67 . However , the state pays the private cotton-grower $100 for each 100 kilograms of cotton sold , thus showing the state 's willingness to promote the private sector and create incentives for the small producers . " Moreover , although 50 percent of the sugar cane , 25 percent of the coffee and 27 percent of the cotton export industries are state-controlled , " the private sector today controls 46 percent of the meat export industry , and during Somoza 's time it had only 14 percent . " None of these explanations , however , have been convincing enough for those Nicaraguans who have lost faith in the Sandinist regime . Among them is a former hero of the revolution , Eden Pastora G6mez , who has gained sympathy and support in liberal circles abroad . Pastora , openly referred to in Nicaragua as " the traitor " but still remembered as a charismatic leader , has also won the backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz . Although Pastora claims to have the support of many Sandinists still working for the junta , how , significant his influence is inside the Nicaraguan military is hard to say . When asked to evaluate his character , one Sandinist militant who had served under him said simply , " Why waste time talking about him ? " Another though , saddened by Pastora 's sudden desertion , called it " our biggest blow so far . " Close associates of the former guerrilla leader say they have formed a coalition of political parties in exile . Not long ago , they met secretly in Venezuela to name a commission in an effort to win international support . They claim , however , that neither Pastora nor any of the other liberal leaders outside Nicaragua are willing to launch an invasion if it means joining forces with the 5,000 Somocistas being trained by the United States . " We do n't want to be associated with Somoza 's National Guard , " explained Alvaro Jerez , a member of the National Democratic Front in Costa Rica . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution is irreversible , but that it has to be rectified . Wedo n't believe in re-creating a repressive government that massacred so many of our people . " There is no need to be a political expert to conclude that the preliminary steps the Sandinist government has taken , whether wrong or right , are the sort that any process of social change must take before it achieves its final form . Nor to conclude that Nicaragua will be unable to attain its goals if it continues to face a belligerent U.S. foreign policy that supports the military subversion of a society in the making . There is a family mausoleum in one of Managua 's cemeteries where two brothers-in-law lie buried , both killed while championing different apolitical factions . The engraving on one tombstone , from a letter written in prison , is a message from an idealistic young Sandinist , killed by Somoza 's National Guard . " If I die , do n't be sad , " it reads . " I am happy because I fought for the freedom of my country , " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman from a center-left party killed by Sandinist security forces for participating in an antigovernment conspiracy . " Let 's not run away to Miami , " it reads . " Let 's stay here and fight . " Those messages illustrate the sad reality of Nicaragua today : the deep split that divides most Nicaraguan families at all social levels . One can only hope those families will find a way to enable all their members , brothers and brothers-in-law , young and old , to work together in the overwhelming task of building a new society . 1:1
