He cropped up anywhere and everywhere : aboard an airliner after takeoff from Athens ; on the bridge of a Mediterranean cruise liner ; in a downtown street in San Salvador ; and last week at crowded air terminals in Rome and Vienna . Wherever he appeared , his victims , if they were not murdered outright , faced endless hours or days of anarchy and wrenching fear , often accompanied by harsh rantings about some strange and often incomprehensible political creed . Once again the terrorist , the sinister perpetrator of violence in the name of politics , showed himself to be , as the 19th century Russian Revolutionary Sergei Nechayev put it , " an implacable enemy of this world . " What made the year different was the willingness of governments to fight back . <P> The essence of the terrorist 's penumbra of fear is that no one can be safe from his danse macabre . In that sense , 1985 was the terrorist 's bumper year . In West Germany , bombs that exploded in and around U.S. military installations killed three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had destroyed an Air India Boeing 747 carrying 329 passengers and crew across the Atlantic in June . In the same month , leftist guerrillas opened fire on four crowded San Salvador cafs , slaying 13 people , including six Americans . <P> The image that summed up the frustrations engendered by the terrorists ' rampage was an airplane : TWA Flight 847 , helplessly ferrying its 153 captives around the Mediterranean after being taken over by two Muslim Shi'ite extremists . The U.S. endured 17 days of prime-time humiliation before the last 39 American hijack victims were released . One American , Navy Diver Robert Stethem , was killed . <P> Another aircraft brought the new , aggressive response into focus : an EgyptAir Boeing 737 with the hawk-faced image of Horus , the ancient Egyptian god of the sky , emblazoned on its tail . Late in November , Egyptian commandos stormed the aircraft at Valletta 's Luqa International Airport on Malta in a bid to rescue 79 passengers and crew aboard who had survived 24 hours of horror . When the rescue mission was over , three Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Controversy immediately erupted over the event 's outcome , but there was near unanimity about the virtue of the rescue mission itself . President Reagan somberly supported the decision to go in . So did the hijack survivors , including Pilot Hani Galal , who had told the tower at Valletta , " Please do something . They 're going to kill us all . " The same shock coupled with somber understanding had accompanied an anti-terrorist assault 17 days earlier in Bogot , Colombia , where at least two dozen terrorists died , along with nearly 100 hostages . <P> The U.S. could boast of a bloodless triumph in October , when U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters accosted an Egyptian Boeing 737 ( by coincidence , the same one that ended up as a charred hulk in Malta ) and forced it to land in Sicily . There it disgorged four young Palestinians who had hijacked the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro and , before giving up , killed Leon Klinghoffer , 69 , a semi-invalid U.S. citizen . An Italian court has already convicted the four men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on trial for piracy and murder .
