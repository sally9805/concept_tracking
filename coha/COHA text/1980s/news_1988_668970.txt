This story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts . This is part 2. 1 Maine West Logic would dictate that the coach of a team that was 35-0 last season , that won the Class AA state championship and was ranked second in the nation by USA Today , would be saying things this season like " It was fun while it lasted . " Fat chance . " Very strong , " is Derril Kipp ' s two-word summation of this team . Why no long walk off a short pier ? Well , says Kipp , the Warriors still have " great perimeter shooting " ( Moira Kennelly , Mary Spielman , Tasia Georganas ) , " good balance " and " excellent team speed . " Want more ? " Maine West ' s perimeter game is as good or better than last year , " says York coach Don Hudgens . " They ' re capable of repeating if their inside game ( Christy Nelson , Jenny McAvoy , Heather Podgorski ) comes along. " 2 Marshall The Commandos are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying George Bush didn ' t win the presidential election by a landslide . So what ? He won , which is something Marshall knows how to do better than anyone . Opposing coaches guess that guard Kim Johnson ' s ballhandling will be missed . That may be true but it ' s hard to argue with coach Dorothy Gaters ' record of achievement . The problem : senior center and **25;56;TOOLONG LaTonia Foster can ' t do it all . Even if the move of outside threat Kenya Pittman to point guard gives Gaters ballhandling and outside scoring , Marshall could prove vulnerable to a lack of depth or Young ' s superior talent . Still , when Gaters promises her team will be tough to beat , the smart answer is " Yes , maam. " 3 Young There are all sorts of reasons to make Young the preseason No. 1 team : Four returning starters from a 21-7 team . A deep , deep bench . But York coach Don Hudgens offers the best : " They have unbelievable personnel , " he says , echoing sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to make a trade with them . Right now , they ' re just a breath away . " Why aren ' t the Dolphins ranked on top ? Hudgens supplies the answer : " They have to get by Marshall . " Beating Marshall is rapidly becoming a passion for coach Arthur Penny ; this may be the year . The difference could be the maturing of junior guard E.C. Hill ( 23 ppg ) and senior forward Cindy Conner ( 18 ppg ) into great , great players . Both were preseason All-America ( Hill , second team , Conner , fourth ) picks by USA Today. 4 York Don Hudgens returns four starters from last year ' s 29-6 Class AA runner- up and Hudgens sees no reason why they can ' t do better this season . " We hope we ' re improved , " he says . " Every one of our girls has matured and we hope to be very competitive . But there are 10-12 teams capable of being very competitive with us . " With senior twins Eileen and Colleen Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amy Stock returning for her fourth year at guard , and Stock and Eileen Graham veterans of two trips to the state finals , York is again a threat to win it all . No superstars here . Just teamwork , balance and experience. 5 Joliet West Bob Dwyer thinks his Tigers have gotten a bad rap for their defense in the past . " I think we play pretty good defense , " said Dwyer . " We hold our opponents under 40 points most of the time . " With seven players back from last season ' s 23-3 team , including four full-time starters , it will be extremely difficult to hold Joliet West ' s balanced attack under 40 . The Tigers will start a junior backcourt of Alison Arnoldi ( 13 points a game ) and Tammie Beckley . Up front are 6-0 sophomore Jackie Williams , 5-10 senior Michelle Eads and 5-10 senior Sarah Tyrrell . Juniors Sonja Peterson and Jenny Bishop and senior Kim Kongprecha provide depth. 6 New Trier Here ' s a hot tip for would-be New Trier beaters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneiter , " I ' d press us to death right now and see if we can handle the pressure . " We in this case means Trevian guards Sheron Waller , a senior who saw limited time a year ago and none directing the flow of traffic , and Heather Leahey . Ballhandling could be New Trier ' s bugaboo-or its salvation . Up front the Trevians have two of the state ' s top players in 6-2 senior center Trish Andrew ( 18 ppg , 9 rebounds ) and senior forward Carrie Ramenofsky ( 16 ppg , 8 rebounds ) . " Defensively we should be pretty good , " says Schneiter . " Our rebounding will be good and I know we can score . " If the guards can get the ball to the scorers , watch out. 7 Buffalo Grove Coach Tom Dineen believes you have to play the best to be the best , and he ' s going to find out right off the bat what his team is made of in Buffalo Grove ' s early-season tournament . No. 6 New Trier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine South will be on hand . The Bison will be ready and waiting with four starters back from last season ' s 23-6 team . Forwards Julie Rood ( 5-11 ) and Debbie Wagner ( 6-0 ) have started the last two years and both were all-Mid-Suburban League selections last year . Guards Melissa Goldsmith and Karrie Jean Kordick also return and 5-9 freshman Michele Ratay is expected to have an immediate impact . Defense will be the key. 8 IHM If you can stop Immaculate Heart of Mary ' s guards you can stop the Tigers , but good luck stopping their guards . The backcourt tandem of Kris Maskala and Cara Frey is one of the best around , and they could lead IHM to another Girls Catholic Athletic Conference crown . Maskala , a 5-9 senior , averaged 22 points and 7 assists a game last year and was a third-team Tribune All-Stater . Frey , a 5-8 senior , averaged 10. 5 points and 5 assists . Sophomore guard-forward Candace Ward ( 5-8 ) , 5-10 junior forward Stacey Petruncio and 6-1 junior Shelly Zalas add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting lineup. 9 St. Edward St. Edward , the premier Class A team in the Chicago-area , has won more than 20 games each of the last five seasons . With three starters and 11 of their top 13 players back , this season should be no different . Stacey Karom , a 5-5 senior point guard , and Meg Hasenmiller , a 5-9 senior forward , both scored in double figures last season ; Jackie Robinson , a 5-7 1/2 senior guard forward , wasn ' t far back . Pam Laudont ( 5-11 ) , Ingrid Crane , Michelle LaPorte , Alison Rudolph and Sharyl Truty ( 5-10 ) all will get a lot of playing time . Coach Ken Mattini says this team is the deepest team he ' s had . " It looks very , very promising after the first week of practice , " he adds. 10 East Aurora Jim Skelley used to be an assistant under former East Aurora boys coach Ernie Kivisto . Need any more information about what to expect from the Tomcats ? " We ' ll run , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ll press and run . " Leading the charge will be two-year letterwinner Reeshema Wood , a 5-9 senior guard-forward who averaged 16 points and 9. 6 rebounds a game last season . Five other players started at one time or another last year due to injuries . Guards Jean Akin and Tracy Lott , forwards Angie Durham and Trina Boatright and center Marisol Arroyo give East plenty of experience. 11 Evanston The Wildkits , one of the favorites in the Central Suburban South , have five players back who started all or part of the season for a team that advanced to the Sweet 16 . The five are 5-8 junior forward-guard Erica Handelman , 5-7 senior forward-guard Nancy Bragiel , 5-10 senior center Sheriel Brown , 5-7 senior forward Jamilah Dorsey and 5-5 sophomore guard Jacqui White . Brown and White are the Wildkits ' most improved players , according to coach Cynthia Bumbry , whose team is small , fast and quick . Defense is the key , says Bumbry , who will count a lot on Brown . " We don ' t have that may big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do the job. " 12 Romeoville The Spartans have three starters back-5-8 Terri Vasquez , 6-1 Beth Underhill and and 5-8 Sandy O ' Rourke . The key is Vasquez , who averaged 15. 5 points , 8 rebounds and 5 assists a game last season and will replace departed standout Lisa Robinson at point guard . Another key is 5-9 transfer Wendy Koehler , who led the SICA West in scoring last season with a 17. 5 average . Claudia Vandiver ( 6-1 ) adds size and sophomore Yesenia Vasquez ( 5-8 ) adds quickness . The Spartans , who won ' t be as quick as last year ' s 24-6 squad , can score from inside or outside , have lots of size , and tons of senior leadership . " This is one of the hungriest teams I ' ve ever coached , " Aguilar says . " Geez , we ' re so happy right now. " 13 Senn " I don ' t see us having any weaknesses , " says Senn coach Tom Miller . " We ' re looking to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall ? Miller pauses . " Well , Young murdered us last year . And Marshall . . . to beat Marshall is to beat a legend . " With four starters back from last year ' s 26-6 team and a transfer-Donna Collins-who spent her freshman and sophomore years at Marshall , Miller is hopeful . Senior forward Patricia Varnardo ( 17 pgg , 10 rebounds ) , sophomore center Latrice Brock , senior guard Sharon Mann and senior point guard Valerie Spann are returning starters who have proved they can win . Beating the Big 2 is another story. 14 Mother McAuley The Mighty Macs lost four starters from last season ' s 22-6 team , but don ' t shed a tear . Coach Diane Darrah has a nice blend of experience and youth that should result in another successful season in the Girls Catholic Athletic Conference . Kerry Krapec is a two-year starter , and along with Heather Madden , Cindy Ach and Maureen Steinemann , the four seniors will shoulder the bulk of the leadership role . The scoring load may be picked up by three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norine Nolan . They started on last season ' s undefeated junior varsity team. 15 Streamwood First the bad news . Second-team All-Stater Donna Groh has packed her bags and taken her 26 points a game to Northwestern . Now the good news . Three starters are back from last season ' s 26-4 team , including two of the Upstate Eight ' s top players-Renee Kanak and Chris Francke . Kanak , a 5-6 senior guard , averaged 18. 5 points last year and hit 32 3-pointers . Coach George Rosner expects her to throw up 100 3-point attempts this season . Francke is a two- year starter who will improve on her 8. 6 scoring average with Groh gone . Stacy Alexander returns to at point guard . The tallest starter will be 5-10 Val Scholtens. 16 Tinley Park Tinley Park will need a strong early start . The SICA Central champions open against powerful Thornton and Joliet West . The Titans return senior center Keri Lorenzen ( 21 ppg and 370 rebounds ) ; senior point guard Kathy Nolan ; senior forward/guard Lolita Gill ; senior forward Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joy O ' Donnell move up from the undefeated sophomore team . " I don ' t mean to brag but they ' re all going to have to contend with us , " says coach Jay Lundy . " On paper we ' re pretty good. " 17 Naperville North Balanced scoring took the Huskies to fourth in the state a year ago . This year they could finish fourth in their conference behind ( pick three ) Wheaton North , Wheaton Central , Glenbard East , Glenbard South . Or first . Coach Dale Shymkewich has two starters-6-1 senior center Lisa Martin ( 9 ppg ) and 5-7 senior guard Jenny Sovacool ( 13 ppg ) - back but after that the lineup is relatively inexperienced . Senior guard Anna Harton moves into the starting lineup and forward Denise Frampton is a move-in whose family spent the last five years in Australia . " A lot depends on how Frampton comes through , " says Shymkewich. 18 West Aurora A lot of coaches believe West Aurora could make a run at the top spot in the tough Upstate Eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malinda Spearman , who averaged 19. 7 points a game as a freshman and 20 points last season , and 5-10 senior Jennie Towers . Tricia Pasley ( 5-10 ) gives the Blackhawks added height , and guards Tara McCloud and Loan Mai each started at one time last season . " We ' ll be quicker than last year , " said Proctor . " And we may be a little better defensively. " 19 Hinsdale South For Hinsdale South to be successful , they will have to compensate for the loss to graduation of Tracey Mondek . That won ' t be easy . Mondek averaged 23 points a game and scored 46 per cent of the Hornets ' points . " Our players know that we have to depend on them to score more without Tracey , " said coach Brenda Whitesell , who will rely on 6-3 center Ange Drzik to pick up some of the slack . Hinsdale also boasts a fine backcourt of Tammi Smith and Tammy Warden . Deanne Schmitz , a transfer from Bolingbrook , and forwards Lisa Laukaitis and Jody Persson will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cary-Grove ' s team , but that doesn ' t mean coach Bruce Kay ' s club won ' t win its fourth straight Fox Valley title . Cary-Grove will rely on an experienced backcourt of Laura Demke and Dawn Coffman and forwards Tracey Vrba ( 5-7 ) and Dani Clark ( 5-8 1/2 ) . Sally Seiffer ( 5-11 ) will step in as the starting center . None averaged over 6 points a game last year-but they did score well enough and play defense well enough to post a 24-5 mark . " We ' ve got a real nice team , " said Kay . " All nine players on our team can play well . We could have a different star each night .
