But the committee said that in acquiring a series of favorable terms and loans at below-market interest rates , Mr. Morgado received " favored treatment . " And it said the transaction raised questions about the " appearance of impropriety. " // Writing for the majority of the panel , the Attorney General ' s Advisory Committee on Ethical Standards , Richard Bartlett , dean of the Albany Law School , said : " Public officers , particularly those in positions of great authority and responsibility , must take care that their private dealings , when viewed by reasonable persons , will not convey the appearance of impropriety . " <> <> Part of Ethics Code Violated // In a separate minority report , three of the seven members who participated in the deliberations said that although Mr. Morgado ' s actions " were completely innocent , " he had violated one section of the state ' s Code of Ethics . The section urges that an official avoid conduct that will " raise suspicions in the public that he is likely to be engaged in acts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority , Judge Louis J. Capozzoli , a retired state appellate judge in Manhattan , said that " under all the circumstances disclosed , an objective person might well have some suspicion that Mr. Morgado unwittingly allowed himself to be used by the sellers in furthering their business interests. " // " We conclude , " he said , " that Mr. Morgado did not comply with the high standards set forth " in the code of ethics " as is expected from a public official . " <> <> No Other Action Contemplated // Violations of the ethics code can be used as a discretionary ground for dismissal , but Timothy Gilles , a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams , said no further action was contemplated. // In a statement , Governor Carey said : " I am pleased that the Attorney General ' s committee has confirmed the propriety of Bob Morgado ' s actions and his good faith in connection with the purchase of his home. " // Mr. Morgado , in a telephone interview , denied that he had received favored treatment , asserting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m pleased with the decision and I am glad it ' s over , " he said. // Asked about the minority report ' s conclusion that he had been used " unwittingly , " Mr. Morgado said he did not understand how being used unwittingly could have violated the code of ethics. // In its two reports , the committee provided new details about the transactions , in which Mr. Morgado , whose annual state salary is about $73 , 000 , sold a house in one Albany suburb for $86 , 000 and purchased one in another suburb for $281 , 000 , without putting any money down. // Following published reports about the transaction in January , Mr. Morgado , denied any wrongdoing , and asked the ethics committee to review it. // The committee met three times in the last few months , reviewed several packets of documents submitted by Mr. Morgado and asked members of Mr. Abrams ' s staff to conduct 10 interviews on its behalf , according to Mr. Gilles . The committee ' s reports were submitted to Mr. Abrams on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House // In its reports , the committee said a development company controlled by Bernard F. Conners , a developer with interests in two leases with the state worth more than $10 million , sold Mr. Morgado the land in a new development and built a five-bedroom , Tudor-style house without requiring a down payment . At the time , Mr. Morgado and his wife , Mary Lou , had assets of $274 , 000 and liabilities of $100 , 000 , according to the reports. // The company , the British American Development Corporation , gave Mr. Morgado a $100 , 000 mortgage that was interest-free the first 30 months and had a 6 1/2 percent interest rate for the remainder of its 30-year duration . The Marine Midland Bank , of which Mr. Conners is a director , gave Mr. Morgado a $180 , 000 mortage at 15 percent interest at a time when the prevailing rate was 18 percent. // The initial accounts of the $100 , 000 loan reported an interest rate of 11 percent rather than the 6 1/2 percent reported by the committee . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 11 percent figure . <> <> Agreement to Repurchase House // British American also agreed to repurchase Mr. Morgado ' s house within three years at the original purchase price , according to the committee . In addition the committee noted that Picotte Real Estate Inc. , a company with interests in many state leases , had offered to waive its commission of $2 , 880 on the sale of Mr. Morgado ' s previous home in exchange for the exclusive right to list his new home if it was offered for sale within five years. // The reports noted that in 1979 , the Marine Midland Bank sought approval from the state for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to purchase a controlling interest in Marine Midland . But after reviewing the dealings between the state and the bank , the developer and the real-estate company , the committee majority said there was no evidence of any connection between the sale of the house and other activities . <> <> ' Need for Great Sensitivity ' // Its report said : " On balance , therefore , we conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgado knowingly or intentionally violated the Public Officers Law nor a reasonable suspicion that he was likely to breach his trust. // " However , this incident underscores the need for great sensitivity on the part of public officers with regard to the manner in which they transact personal business . Public officers , particularly those in positions of great authority and responsiblity , must take care that their private dealings , when viewed by reasonable persons , will not convey the appearance of impropriety . In short , they should recognize that what may be acceptable transactions as between private citizens may , as here , raise questions when they involve public officers dealing with parties who do business with the state . " <> <> Morgado ' Known and Trusted ' // In the minority report , Judge Capozzoli said that , according to an affidavit by the president of British American , Francis W. Coughlin , no down payment was required because Mr. Morgado was " known and trusted. " // " It is of interest to note , " the judge wrote , " that the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgado and who dealt with him were mindful of his position and have expressed the thought that they wanted to be careful about their dealings with him so as not to have it appear that he was getting favored treatment . Did not the same thought occur to Mr. Morgado ? Should it not have occurred to him during the negotiations , that being the prominent figure he was , the transaction was bound to attract the attention of the public ? " // The minority report goes on to say that the committee " is firmly convinced that there was no connection between his official duties and the transaction under examination and there has been no violation by Mr. Morgado of his trust. " // " His actions in this matter , " it says , " have been completely innocent and not illegal in any way . " " The only question raised herein , " the report says , " is whether he exercised good judgment under the circumstances . " <> <> Other Panel Members // It concluded that " an objective person might well have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sellers in furthering their business interests " and that Mr. Morgado thus violated a section of the code of ethics. // Voting with Mr. Bartlett in the majority were Malcolm Hoenlein , executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York ; John Smythe , a former president of the Erie County Bar Association , and Lita Taracido , former president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. // Voting with Judge Capozzoli were Prof. Charles Hamilton of Columbia University , and Frank Dowd , a former vice president of the University of Rochester. // Two members of the committee , Robert McKay , executive director of the Institute of Judicial Administration , and Prof. Judith Younger of the Cornell Law School , did not participate in the deliberations. //
