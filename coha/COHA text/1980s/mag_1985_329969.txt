General Motors Chairman Roger Smith was beaming with his lights on high last week as he celebrated the biggest and boldest acquisition in his company 's history . Two years ago , Smith revealed that the world 's largest automaker ( 1984 sales : $83.9 billion ) was courting a mysterious " lulu " of a company , one that would help transform GM from something of a stodgy powerhouse into a high-tech star . Now the Detroit giant was driving off with its prize . After a contest in which it outbid Ford and Boeing , GM agreed to acquire Hughes Aircraft , a major defense contractor ( 1984 sales : $5.8 billion ) , for more than $5 billion in cash and stock . The landmark deal is the largest non-oil merger ever . Said Smith : " Lulu is home now . " <P> The purchase gives GM direct access to some of the most advanced technology in American industry . Smith , who interrupted a European trip to return to the U.S. after his company was named the winning bidder , said GM will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Added Smith at a news conference : " Electronics , we believe , is going to be the key to the 21st century . " Products manufactured by Hughes , which no longer makes aircraft , range from microchips and lasers to communications satellites and air-to-air missiles . The California company is the largest supplier of electronic equipment to the military , and the seventh biggest defense contractor . <P> The Hughes merger is the latest in a dazzling series of moves that Smith , 59 , has undertaken as part of a program to reshape his company . Since he took over the top job in 1981 , the sandy-haired chairman has been intent on revamping GM into an agile performer that can compete successfully against the Japanese . To reach that goal , he has been creating more daring deals than any of his predecessors since the 1920s , when Alfred P. Sloan Jr . welded a jumble of companies into the modern GM . <P> Smith 's handiwork can already be seen throughout the corporation . Bent on beating the Japanese , he startled Detroit by deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Japanese manufacturers , Smith has taken the unprecedented step of creating a joint venture with Toyota to build a small car in California . He further shocked the unwary by establishing a separate company to produce the subcompact Saturn , which will bear GM 's first new nameplate since the Pontiac was introduced in 1926 . Saturns will start rolling off the assembly line in two years . <P> Barely pausing for breath , Smith has directed a far-reaching corporate reorganization and has been snapping up high-tech companies that make everything from industrial robots to computer software for artificial intelligence . Prior to last week 's agreement , GM 's boldest acquisition was the $2.55 billion 1984 purchase of Electronic Data Systems , the world 's largest data-processing firm . <P> After returning to Austria last week to resume meetings with GM 's European board of advisers , Smith discussed his corporate strategy in an interview with TIME Correspondent William McWhirter in Salzburg . Said Smith : " The U.S. is going through the largest technological revolution in its history , and we 're going to be standing right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have E.D.S. , Hughes and GM as the natural base for both growth and diversity . We are now being viewed as a high-tech company , not a medium-tech , mass- production one . "
