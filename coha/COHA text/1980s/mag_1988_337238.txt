To find a symbol of resistance to Israel 's occupation of Arab lands , one need look no further than the family of Mohammed Hamad . Since he fled Israel during the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948 , Hamad , 60 , has lived in the Kalandia refugee camp in the West Bank , north of Jerusalem . There he has fathered six of his eight sons . Each has displayed more anti-Israeli fervor than the last , and all but the eldest have served time in prison for offenses against Israeli military rule , which began after the 1967 Six-Day War . Three of Hamad 's sons are now in prison , one is a fugitive , and another is in exile in Jordan . The Hamads ' eight-room home has also been bricked up , a procedure often used by the Israelis to punish troublemakers . <P> Two weeks ago , Israeli soldiers entered a shabby camp dwelling , where some of the family now live , and took away Hamad 's son Bashir , 26 . Last week the Israeli government announced that Bashir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be deported . <P> Bashir Hamad was one of nine Palestinians chosen for expulsion in the wake of the month-long rebellion that has swept through the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank . Though seven have already spent time in prison , six for involvement in terrorism , the Israeli army accused only three of directly fomenting the recent riots ; the rest are asserted to be " hard-core agitators . " Hamad , though not cited for involvement in the current unrest , is accused of " organizing disturbances and participating in them " in his role as a leader of the Shabiba , a young men 's group with close ties to the outlawed Palestine Liberation Organization . The Israelis say that 876 Palestinians have been deported since 1967 , while the Arabs put the number at 2,500 . Only 19 have been expelled since 1980 . <P> Riots broke out in both Gaza and the West Bank just hours after the decision was announced . Each day last week Israeli leaders declared the fury spent , but each day it continued . Five more Palestinians died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first to die was a West Bank woman shot in the chest  --  mistakenly , according to the Israeli military  --  while she was hanging out her wash . Some of the worst violence erupted in the Gaza refugee camp of Khan Yunis , where hundreds poured into the streets after they learned that an Islamic fundamentalist leader , Hassan Ghanayem Abu Shakra , 27 , would be among those expelled . Soldiers at first held off the crowds with tear gas , rubber bullets and water cannons . But soon they resorted to live ammunition to ward off the protesters ' hail of stones and debris . <P> " Deportations are the maximum deterrent we have today , " said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir . " We use it with people who can not be reformed . " Though the vast majority of Israelis agreed with Shamir , the decision was denounced by Israel 's friends and enemies alike . Declaring that the expulsions violated the Geneva Convention of 1949 , the U.S. joined the other 14 members of the United Nations Security Council in demanding that Israel rescind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan Administration has voted for a resolution in the Security Council that criticizes Israel by name since 1982 , when the group voted unanimously to condemn the Israeli military assault on Beirut during its invasion of Lebanon .
