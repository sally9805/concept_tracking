Q. <P> How will the death of Ayatullah Khomeini and Hashemi Rafsanjani 's election as President of Iran affect the Hizballah ? <P> A. <P> I am not the official spokesman for the Hizballah , so I can not answer this question as an involved person , but I can speak as an observer . There is no major change in strategy , but there is a change in approach , caused by the phase that Iran is now entering . The previous phase was one of war and building the Revolution . The current phase is one of peace and rebuilding the country . The conditions put forward by Rafsanjani for restoring relations with the U.S. are the same ones he put forward during the life of the Imam ( ( Khomeini ) ) . They are that America should stop its aggressive policy against Iran and that America can express that by releasing the frozen Iranian assets . <P> Q. <P> It will be difficult for the U.S. to free Iranian assets so long as American hostages are being held in Lebanon . <P> A. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran 's assets , it was a big country taking an illegal action . The problem of the hostages is related to individuals , who might be friendly to Iran but who , from a legal point of view , are not responsible as a country . The hostages were not kidnaped by Iran . They were kidnaped by organizations in Lebanon that may not have any relationship to Iran . <P> Q. <P> Americans are convinced that Iran financed these movements . <P> A. <P> That is one point of view . Many countries finance movements but do not interfere in their day-to-day operations . America finances Israel with more than $3 billion a year ; can we as Arabs or Muslims assume that the U.S. is responsible for everything Israel is doing now ? <P> Q. <P> That is exactly the point of view the Hizballah takes . <P> A. <P> We believe that America is responsible for what Israel does because there is a strategic alliance between the U.S. and Israel . Do Americans accept our accusations ; do you agree with the charges we make ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If Americans do n't accept our accusations , why do they make the same kind of accusations against us ? As I see it , the kidnaping of American hostages is the result of political turbulence . The problem is the violence that Israel 's presence has imposed on the region . We do not consider kidnaping to be a humane act . We do not think it is right for a human being to take away the freedom of another human being . We have been working recently to educate people at the Friday prayers against this method . <P> Q. <P> Many of the Friday prayer sermons have been strongly anti-American . <P> A. <P> We are not against the American people , but we are against the policy of the American Administration , especially as it relates to Israel . <P> Q. <P> When Americans see the case of Colonel Higgins , who was hanged , Americans who know nothing about Lebanon are suddenly filled with hatred . Is n't it time now to call on the people responsible to stop ? <P> A. <P> We understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have been working on it , and we are still speaking out about the necessity of closing this file . But we also know that America has the practical means to solve the problem if it wants .
