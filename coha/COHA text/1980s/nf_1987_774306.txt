txt  | Does an approach to problem solving appear because a company cuts inventory ? Or does the resolve to be open in addressing problems allow the reduction of inventory ? Attention to problem solving and people issues starts first . Otherwise , everyone is only frustrated when inventory is limited because they are not practiced as a team in methods of making and standardizing improvement . One of the popular misconceptions of JIT among workers is that its objective is to speed up the work pace ? put everything in fast forward . That is no more true than the belief that its sole objective is to cut inventory . In fact , too fast a work pace is not good because workers make too many mistakes , and a slow one is not desirable for the same reason . A good work pace sustains concentration but is varied enough in content to stimulate thinking while working . Monotonous work can not always be avoided , but it is not desired by most humans . However , the relationship of good timing to excellence in operations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are described as follows . Cycle Time Concept Doing tasks at regular time intervals improves the possibilities for refining and standardizing them ? up to the point where monotony sets in , and then perhaps automation or computers can be employed . For instance , setting up the same machine with the same tooling at about the same time every day stimulates people to make setup into a standardized , well-practiced activity , which aids quality . Any work that can be done in a repeating cycle can be more effectively studied for improvement . Study by comparing operations from one cycle to the next , which can be done by basic or advanced methods . A basic approach is to time 10 cycles of an operation , such as manually loading components in a printed circuitboard . Both observer and operator should carefully note methods of work during each cycle , then review results : 1 . What happened during the longest cycle time that could be eliminated ? 2 . What happened during the shortest cycle time that might be incorporated into each cycle ?  | Improving methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variance in cycle times . Doing either can improve quality as well as productivity . A name for this is cycle time analysis . Any activity that can be cycle timed can be studied for improvement by cycle time analysis : Single-station operations . Man-machine interactions in cells . Throughput times of material through plant . Preventive maintenance procedures . Material handling cycles . Developing operations to produce at a steady rate creates the basis for repeating cycles of work in many activities . A singlestation operation is usually simple . A man-machine cell analysis is a little more complex , but try to keep it simple anyway . Cycle time analysis of material throughput time is really analysis of many cycle times of all operations through which material travels on its way through a plant . Cyclic work and cycle time analyses apply to nonplant activities too , such as preparation to execute engineering changes . Why engineering changes ? If materials consumption runs at steady rates for one to four weeks , do not clutter smooth operations with disruptive changes . Hold them until it becomes time to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular schedule change cycle . It is not so hard if almost everything goes in cycles and if inventory is reduced so that using up obsolete parts is no longer a major factor in engineering change execution . A plant in continuous improvement precipitates many engineering changes , so a company should learn to execute them well . Getting many people to learn to use cycle times for synchronization and improvement is an important early step in mastering JIT in a repetitive production environment . Then , a simple final assembly schedule providing for steady parts consumption also provides a simple basis for many people to plan their work in cycles so everything is ready to deliver material at a steady rate . Material is delivered at regular times , tooling is refurbished at regular times , and everyone prepares to revise the pattern of work at a regular time . And , all activity done in cycles can be refined in methodology .  | This whole set of ideas has been called the " cycle time concept , " mostly by Japanese so far . According to this concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting activities to plan their work in sensible cycles that fit together . Cyclic activities are also easy to analyze for improvement . It is simple , and simple things work . Refined further , schedules allowing repetitive , low-variance operation also provide the basis for simple , not complex , automation in indirect as well as direct production areas . Simple automation costs less . Close Timing , Short Cycles . Lead times are usually thought of as lead times for material to go through a plant , and reducing materials cycle times has the easily seen benefit of reducing inventory investment . Other benefits are not so obvious , however . First is the elimination of waste . Materials cycle times are cut by improving quality , eliminating inspections , eliminating double handling , reducing setup times , and so forth . Every one of Shingo 's seven wastes adds time to the processing of the product , much of it while material is just sitting . Inventory sitting is idle money ; but worse , it incurs unnecessary cost . One way to attack this is by flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 4-5 . If this is done in detail , many steps are seen to be unnecessary . Eliminate the unnecessary . Briggs &; Stratton has refined this approach so that flow charts are constantly being prepared to open the minds of staff and supervisors to new opportunities to eliminate the unnecessary . This is a process of people developing skill and knowledge about a product and the way it is made . Slipping back is easy once a manufacturer has developed , so a limit on inventories provides an indicator of status and stimulates alertness to maintain progress . Reports of various kinds , including cost reports , can be fuzzed and hedged , but the existence of inventory does not lie . It is evidence of manufacturing proficiency or lack of it . Tight visible control of inventory stimulates people once they have developed ; but , for this to work , management at all levels must pay attention and read the signs for what they are . People change , supervisors rotate , and product designs evolve ? not always in positive ways . A manager checking inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just checking the production workers to exchange pleasantries . He or she is checking the condition of the company as well . As development proceeds , another objective of short cycles is flexibility ? ability to respond to change . Ability to respond to changing customer demand sounds the opposite of running at a steady rate for several weeks , but it is not . If schedules change often enough , the next cycle 's schedule can be very different from the current one , both in overall volume and in the mix of items produced . Inventory levels must reflect mix changes within a current schedule period . However , in most cases , companies are able to shorten the lead times given to almost all customers . Reduce the total pass through time of the material train from months to weeks to days , beginning inside the plant , then working with cycle times through suppliers , which is more difficult . This is accomplished by eliminate the wasteful activities , improve the quality in operations , and synchronize the timing as much as possible . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of all material through the entire production network . Some material sources can not be improved in the short run . There are no miraculous transformations , so push the inventory levels as far back in the total process as possible , remembering that inventory existence , not ownership , counts . Once inventory starts to be converted into product , keeping lead times short as possible permits making what the market actually wants as nearly as possible . If the inventory can be pushed all the way back to " iron ore in the ground , " it can be converted into anything ? provided the process to do so exists . TIMING AND FLEXIBILITY Long lead times complicate an entire business , not just production operations . For instance , commercial aircraft production has a very long lead time , so aircraft orders start with preliminary feelers , then order definitions , then options to order , followed by purchase contracts hedged with cancelation clauses , review steps , acceptance procedures , and a tangle of financial arrangements . Few manufacturing businesses are this complex , but long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices become established , it sometimes is not obvious that a thicket of  | complexity grew up around some rotten old stumps of quality problems and long lead times ? really waste . The total manufacturing process should be developed for the necessary flexibility as well as for reducing cycle times of material . Quality , short lead times and flexibility uncomplicate things . However , the total manufacturing process must be developed for flexibility ? understanding customer needs , product design , process development . Flexibility is important in several different ways . Product Mix Flexibility . Ability to switch quickly from one product to another , one model to another , or one part to another  | is essential for this . Low setup times allow this to be done at reasonable cost and also improve quality in the process . To attain flexibility , reduce setup times on all the machines through which material must flow . Reducing them on only a few machines in a long series does little good . Lot sizes remain large , lead times long , and eventually the incentive for keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If lead times are short , all equipment must run at about the overall rate demanded by the market and must make the mix demanded . Therefore , smart automation is not high-speed equipment but rather equipment that will do what is needed at the time needed .  | Standardize and automate the setup operations , not just the running operations . Total Volume Flexibility . A plant capable of operating successfully over a broad volume range needs a low break-even point . Toyota is said to have a break-even objective of 30 percent of rated capacity . Break-even depends on revenue as well as cost , but one clear goal is not to invest much . Another is to create operations in which people may be added and subtracted , machines added and removed , and machines function over a range of speeds . All plants can exercise at least one option : increasing or decreasing the amount of time for production . Having numerous flexibility options involves people issues as well as hardware issues . The situation to avoid if at all possible is an operation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be kept running for a long time so that heats or other conditions stabilize to give good quality . That leads to decisions to run the operation just to be running it ? which builds inventory . People Flexibility . Inflexible workers have the same effect . Specialists stand around waiting for someone else to finish their part of a job . The same is true of specialists in staff areas , except people are sitting instead of standing . Specialists are necessary , but a company is better off if everything does not have to wait on them or keep them busy . Cultivate specialists who believe that less specialized work is not beneath them . People willing and able to do whatever is within their capabilities when it is needed are the people side of JIT . They make balancing tough sequences of operations possible . They respond to volume and mix changes . They do what humans are by nature equipped to do ? a variety of things . If production at one operation must stop , they move somewhere else . If the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person transferring can domino a dozen others into unfamiliar jobs . A layoff of any magnitude can cause almost all workers to start a new learning experience , to the detriment of both quality and productivity . Inflexible work rules are so detrimental to shop productivity that they have become management targets in union negotiations . However , management and staff inflexibility also takes a toll ? perhaps greater but harder to see . Specialists are likely to have a  | narrow perspective of the relationship of their own job to the whole business , which complicates communication . " Communicating " in various ways is a big part of business overhead . Much of the communicating is relating to others and to the total work to be accomplished . Job rotation and visibility are just as important in staff and management work as on the shop floor , and they are vital in adjusting to variations in volume and mix . Engineering Change Flexibility . Nothing stays constant in product lines with short life cycles , and changes occur even on long-life products . The desired improvements in the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design changes are a fact of life , and how they are managed is very important . Collect engineering changes for execution at regular times . This becomes feasible with low inventory once the cycle time concept is in place , and it simplifies the communication about when to execute and whether a change was actually executed . ( Most manufacturers are not exceedingly proud of their communications on engineering changes . ) Move each new design as far down the learning curve as possible before production starts ; then press the revisions necessary for producibility in one or two short bursts as soon as production has begun . All Japanese motorcycle companies introduce several new models per month into plants already producing a large mix . Each day after production is complete , some of the time remaining is used for trying the new tooling and arrangements for upcoming models . When it appears that production can go without a hitch , the new model is inserted into the regular production line up for the succeeding schedule month . Any necessary finishing changes are incorporated at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production are much more subject to engineering change than others , for example , wiring harnesses . Design changes of many different kinds call for a change in the wiring harness . Therefore , that business must not only be just-in-time with production but just-in-time with changes in design . The ability to rework the fixtures used for harness layup must also be " quick change . "  | New Product Introduction . Development of skill in total quality and the many facets of JIT manufacturing may confer a competitive advantage ? ability to work down the learning curve of a new product start-up very quickly . Timing here is of as much importance as anywhere . Japanese companies measure progress by counting the total improvement suggestions made and implemented . Suggestions are a morale booster for employees but also indicative of much more , such as extensive practice of cycle time analysis . Employees of all stations who make and implement suggestions keep themselves sharp . If products and processes have matured , many suggestions may be rather trivial , but when a new product idea comes along , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant . ( The current major concern of Japanese managers is how to improve the introduction of new products and technology . ) If a new product incorporates leading edge technology , it may be hard to refine for production Considerations . However , many new products result from a series of small technological steps , not a great technology leap . Much design engineering ought be a highly integrative organizational activity to achieve fast , smooth introductions . CONCLUSION Just-in-time manufacturing is the pursuit of the very best management approach possible for a company to meet objectives from eliminating waste right on through continuous improvement . Usually it is seen as only picking up techniques or , at best , making an addition to the management methods known to the company . It really is a way to run a company . Not all companies can use all techniques . No one should expect them to . However , most of the ideas can be used in some combination by any manufacturer dedicated to manufacturing excellence . APPENDIX : WORKPLACE ORGANIZATION COMES TO INDUCTOHEAT : JIT IN THE JOB SHOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do much with just-in-time manufacturing . That footnote Target , periodical news source of the Association for Manufacturing Excellence , vol. 2 , no. 3 , Fall 1986.  | assumption is being tested by Inductoheat , a small manufacturer tucked away in Madison Heights , a northern suburb of Detroit . True , Inductoheat is not into mixed model assembly or Kanbanstyle production control , but it is well along in transforming itself by much of the manufacturing philosophy promoted by the Association of Manufacturing Excellence . Inductoheat is the quintessential job shop . They design , build , and install induction and resistance heating equipment , controllers , and power supplies . Well over 90 percent of sales is a brisk business in electric heating systems for heat treating and forging . Most jobs require some degree of custom engineering , and some are genuine technical development projects with the customer . Although the company is striving to increase the percentage of near-standard units in the product line , none are totally off-the-shelf , and it builds to order . During the past five years , Inductoheat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to global scope , and changed its name . Until recently , the company was known as IPE Cheston . The product line is attractive for three reasons : 1 . Induction and resistance heating makes it possible to generate multiple heat treat histories in different parts of the same workpiece. 2 . These systems are the major means to heat treat in line with other operations on the same workpiece , thus eliminating a trip to central heat treat , which is of considerable interest to companies reconfiguring metalworking operations into cells . 3 . They are pretty good at it . John Stoll , vice president of operations ( and an AME member ) , was reluctantly persuaded to part with the figures in Table 1 . Privately owned , Inductoheat 's owners brag no details in an annual report and regard all dollar figures as personal among their employees , their auditors , and themselves . Inside the company , cost particulars have become relatively open compared to five years ago . The owners wholeheartedly encourage John 's shifting of responsibility to the hands-on workers , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results so far . John just says that " things are going well , " and he is spending more of this time nurturing newly acquired ventures in other parts of the world . Table 1 compares 1981 with 1985 . In 1981 , the company began running an MRP package , which was part of its transformation ,  | but results that year were average for the history of Inductoheat up to that time . In 1982 , the firm lost money because of the economic debacles among its automotive customers , and in that year it began the changes in workplace organization , which stimulated other activities normally associated with the JIT philosophy . 1985 shows results after the operating revolution had taken off . ( In fairness , it was also a better capital spending year in Detroit , but the company might not have been in so good a position to take advantage of it without operating changes . ) Inductoheat designs and fabricates in its own shop the items critical to its systems ? the induction heating mechanisms and the electronic controller boards . Everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12,000 active standard part numbers , and other items unique to each job are purchased . The shop consists of four departments in a single-floor plant : 1 . Electrical . 2 . Inductor. 3 . Mechanical assembly . 4 . Development . Sales and engineering offices are in the same building , so all operations are now contained on site .  | The story starts in 1980 , when several managers attended an Oliver Wight MRP II seminar ; as a result , they began shopping for an MRP package that was both simple and low cost . They found one for $15,000 plus $500 for installation , not counting their time , which was about four months of do-it-yourself . Most of the effort was in creating the bills of material and formalizing the inventory . The system began running in mid-1981 . It is a simple system with no extras . Bills of material rarely go more than three levels deep , so it costs little to run and maintain . It mostly explodes and backschedules and pumps out minimum paper : weekly time buckets , weekly regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item job numbers at job staging time . A bill of material is created for each job , which is simplified by using modular bills for standard subassemblies and modifying them as needed . Jobs early on the horizon often have an incomplete bill , which is necessary for the long lead time materials , and the bills of material grow to completion as design evolves during the lead time . Everything is done with only one bill of material . This basic system helped Inductoheat by applying computer system to the materials confusion factor , but operations were still amiss . The firm thought about supercharging the system horsepower with a shop floor control module and capacity planning module but decided on a different route . To see why , first look at the content of total customer lead time for typical Inductoheat orders : figure Shop work is a small portion of very long lead time projects , whose duration , urgency , and technical innovation exhibit great  | variance . Much of the effort is determining how to meet the customer 's specific need and translating that need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use as a heating system . A due date is more than a target for suppliers , fabrication , and assembly . Tardiness or indecision in design can easily lengthen actual lead times for shop work , at the same time delaying the beginning of it until all must be done under time pressure . Worse , it can befuddle drawings , specifications , and shop instructions , and it does not help system installation and training for the customer either . The condition of a shop floor reflects this . From it one can read the condition of management in places far from production . Workplace organization in the complete sense is reorganization of all operations because all funnel into the shop floor in some way . Inductoheat began shop floor workplace organization in 1982 , following the five-step plan : 1 . Remove everything unnecessary , not just inventory . 2 . Create a location for everything . 3 . Cleanliness . 4 . Discipline . 5 . Participation . Personnel practices , supervisory methods , work methods , and many other changes accompanied this , perhaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . It is hard to distinguish the causes of change after the fact . The company began by clearing out all excess material , equipment , tooling , and trash ? five semi-trailer dumpsters full . To create a location for everything , the policy toward vendor deliveries was tightened . All material specific to a job was to be delivered within the two weeks established as the staging time for a job . At the start of the two weeks , a new job was assigned a cleared location , roped off in assembly , and a sign was posted designating the job . Standard parts were pulled from the stockroom and moved to staging . The delivery times were enforced by either shipping back material arriving early or refusing to pay for it early . All regular suppliers now understand Inductoheat means business with this rule , and , at its size , few suppliers would regard it as a gorilla exercising leverage . As a result of eliminating double-handling of material , total labor decreased about 30 percent for an equivalent job . Previously , if some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , material was pulled for a job ; however , the staging stretched  | out so some parts had to return to stores or be moved to make way for work that really was ready . The practice had led to inventory all over two different buildings on two sides of the street . After about a year of this , Inductoheat progressed down to where all operations were done in one building ; soon after , only one building was needed for everything . In the meantime , the number of total jobs being finished increased . The workplace organization , coupled with other actions , led to improved visibility in the shop . ( Visibility is the ability to see shop status and problems at a glance , and shop visibility makes transparent many problems originating elsewhere . In a sense , major improvement in shop visibility opens the eyes to waste in many nonshop activities . The capital savings from space reduction occur but once ; the benefits of improved visibility go on as long as the organizational discipline for it remains . ) A job schedule board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done for one of those job numbers . By MRP , material is acquired an appropriate lead time before assembly staging , and all material is issued to an assembly job number . No person or report must advise workers of priority of fabrication work . The job schedule board tells them . As soon as a new job staging area is roped off , no one must tell a worker to expedite a lagging part . The situation is obvious ? in fact , so obvious that people on the floor are upset if nonshop activity is not going well . John Stoll and other managers read the same signs by walking through the shop , and they become upset too ; thus the shop condition has become a communications medium of both management and labor . At Inductoheat , engineering design details do not always work out as fabrication and assembly proceed . Fabricators can not work metal as intended , and assemblers must modify parts so that the as-built configuration works . Simple changes they make themselves . Those critical to operation require engineering recalculation . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The design engineers must work directly with the shop workers fabricating and assembling their design ? no intermediaries . That ended a time-consuming responsibility of management , and since there is well-posted schedule to meet , engineers and shop workers both learn a lot , and Inductoheat 's total operations are much improved . Assembly times are estimated to have been whacked by 50 percent . All workers are multiskilled . Inductoheat now trains them that way . Five years ago , specialists stood around waiting on each other  | to do their bit of the total project . Now the same worker does machining , welding , brazing , assembly , and even loading of printed circuitboards on occasion . One of the two supervisors loads PC boards during otherwise idle time . Loading boards had previously been considered one of the lowest status jobs , but no more . The key was to abolish both formal and informal job status symbols . Everybody comes dressed for work and pitches in doing whatever is necessary . Inductoheat begins training new workers as machinists . Then they learn torchwork ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to assembly , so all assemblers can make or modify basic parts as necessary . Naturally , some workers have specialized tasks , and some have more skill than others . Three of the more skilled individuals are lead workers with engineers on the newest technology products , and the demands of the work advance as technology progresses . Inductoheat 's viability comes from proprietary experience in building specialized equipment ; an inductor , for instance , may be a " work of art , " not built after only a few hours watching others do it . However , the specialists work elsewhere as required , which greatly simplifies capacity planning . Unless they overload total labor capacity , they will probably meet schedule . In the process of workplace organization , four special departments were folded into others , and workers became responsible for their own quality . The quality control specialist now on board spends much of his time instructing everyone else . Inspection is performed only on incoming material . Another quality check is performed by assemblers who check the matchup of mechanical detail as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly , the nonrepetitive work does not much lend itself to control charting , so most of the quality improvement consists of refining the processes of both design and shop work . CAD/CAM linkage should reduce some of the errors , but the firm has not yet made great progress with it . Preventive maintenance has not been totally developed , but workers primarily look after that also . They are responsible for the proper functioning of their equipment . This egalitarian approach to shop work has been tough on supervisory and managerial egos . Supervisors and managers became facilitators , making it possible for hands-on people to get their work done . Supervisors coordinate activity , authorize overtime and hiring , but sometimes only instigate decisions by workers on such things  | as what kind of read-out devices to put on gauges . They are measured by ( 1 ) quality of performance and progress of the work force and ( 2 ) making due dates . This has been a loss of power in the sense of ordering people around , and it takes acclimation to accept being measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gone are any measures resembling labor efficiency or equipment utilization . They are unnecessary . People and equipment generally perform when needed . There is no union . Pay increases are based only on merit . Wages and salaries are discussed openly . Cost-of-living increases or " automatic " increases of any kind are a thing of the past . No job guarantees exist , but job security is " understood " after five years of merit work and as long as merit work continues thereafter . One veteran was dismissed after 10 years because of inability to regularly arrive on time for work with his team , and it is considered important to the morale of those giving extra effort not to mollycoddle such cases . There was no special problem in reducing the work force through attrition . Profit sharing sweetens everyone 's pay . A small quarterly bonus is based on percent of gross earnings . In addition , an annual bonus is declared , usually 15 percent of gross profit or 15 percent of gross wages , whichever is higher . The effect is heightened interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offices . Everyone would rather spend the money on something else . Shop workers do not restrain criticism if new carpet is ordered for an office . How did Inductoheat start all this ? It got a general direction in 1982 and started reorganizing work in the shop , learning and planning the next moves as it went . It had no detailed five-year plan ( and still does not ) . Too much planning is regarded as a waste also . The next moves are mapped out no more than six months to a year in advance . For Inductoheat , the world is too uncertain to project operations changes much further than that , but no one can call what it does only " muddling through . " COMMENTARY ON WORKPLACE ORGANIZATION Inductoheat is a lean and busy organization , not eager to host parades through the plant or play part-time consultant . Characterize it as short on talk and long on doing , but it will share ideas with other doers.  | Larger manufacturers doubtless will find the Inductoheat approach a little more extemporaneous than can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its story are useful for anyone . The description emphasized workplace organization , but everything is connected to everything else in JIT , and therefore workplace organization is part of a total fabric . Workplace organization can be done by any manufacturer ? if management has the will . A common denominator of top-quality Japanese job shops ( not all are in that category ) is good workplace organization , what Japanese refer to as either the 4S or 5S approach . This is almost always presented to visitors as part of the management approach , but too often it is presented as " housekeeping , " which implies only cosmetics , and as simply part of everyone 's general understanding of how manufacturing should be run . Unfortunately , it is not part of everyone 's general understanding . Where it is , the JIT approach is easier to accept . Workplace organization is part of the bedrock of that understanding . Many of the problems are not with the workers . Once they understand , worker acceptance comes easily from most . ( Acceptance from a political union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt is in the ranks of management , staff , and supervisors . In all likelihood , the new roles of staff and managers will not coincide with the views that many have of their positions in life . Some typical remarks : I 'm not really doing anything ; there 's no recognition here anymore . ( Translation : There is a shortage of crises , and I do not know how to behave without one . ) It could be done quicker if we put some experts on it . ( Translation : I do not get to show my expertise or be fully in charge of a project . It is no fun being an advisor just explaining things . ) Learning how to work directly with hands-on people is difficult for staff people , and learning how to work with them differently is difficult for many supervisors . However , a major problem for all of us is acceptance of responsibility when a visibility indicator of nonperformance points to us , and it is certainly one of the major reasons why JIT/TQ philosophy is easy to preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automation without the Expense Why automate ? Because when done well , automation attains much more than merely substituting machine labor for manual . The objective is to make overall improvement in manufacturing ? to eliminate waste , improve quality , reduce cost , and increase flexibility ( the same goals as for manufacturing excellence ) . Automation affects the total company . Many organizational functions must be closely integrated , starting with product engineering intertwined with production process engineering . A product designed for robotic assembly needs parts that can be grasped and oriented by robots . Seams welded by robots may be different in design than those welded by a human . A human can compensate for seam flaws , but a robot ca n't . However , a robot can reach angles very fatiguing to the human . The engineering of automated processes must create the exact sequence of operations and the positioning of material . It must be particular on work envelopes , reproducibility of conditions , and possible exceptions . Variance of process capabilities must be kept narrow enough to prevent random defects . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality problems can come from anywhere , and one of the more common problems observed in automated machining cells , for instance , is finding them choked with cracked or porous castings . Sometimes they are equipped with automatic sensing to detect these conditions and also to compensate for dimensional variance in the castings , which should not exist in the first place .  | Design of the total automated process must consider quality in as well as quality out , product design evolution , maintenance , training , versatility of operators ( or of programmed equipment ) , schedule change flexibility , changeover times , scheduling methods , and on and on . Handling and turnaround of tools is as important as that of the material . Lead times are important . Putting all this together , the conclusion is soon reached that a company must develop the way automation will fit with the total organization and the way the organization will fit with automation : marketing , personnel , scheduling , purchasing ? everything , not just engineering and production . If a major automation project is not considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that engineers will oversell the technology while detractors will hold back because they do not see how to change all the aspects of management that will be affected . Each functional specialty will see it its own way . The pieces may not fit together , and people are unprepared . Distraction is easy because automation makes an impressive show ; robots and flashing lights suggest a technical fix without the necessary organizational development . Automation may not look so impressive in the financial statements . Video tapes of unmanned operations are taken while the process is running and technicians are nowhere to be seen . Overhead is tucked away in less photogenic locations . It is useful to remember that while those factories that run untended all night represent remarkable attainments in defectfree operation , the early ones were developed by machine tool companies and feature much of the same equipment they sell . Not that automation is bad . It depends on its cost and how it is employed . The evil is in being tricked into a false show , somewhat like a young man buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shiniest . A well-built plain one would do the job with less cost and trouble . The rest is waste except in the owner 's aesthetic perceptions . In the same way , watching a robot perform a task that is really doubling-handling material ( and thus should not be done at all ) is painful . Equally wasteful are guided vehicles or even conveyors going round and round until the function of transporting seems lost in the tizzy of being a moving warehouse without observable destination . A great deal of showmanship consists of energetic , but unnecessary motion .  | Much of automation 's desired effect comes from the advanced preparation , and more from the discipline to use it wisely once in place . If much of the benefit can be obtained from preparation and discipline , perhaps it can be gained without investing much in the equipment and software itself . That , of course , is the idea . GAINING DISCIPLINE Spending big money quickly on automation is not wise . In the end , its effectiveness depends as much on organizational preparation as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be beaten just by outspending them . Major automation can not be effectively " installed " ; it must be accompanied by a way of organizational life . Most companies do not have the capital for heavy investment in automation anyway . Of necessity they must try to capture as much benefit as possible with minimum expenditure . Even the company with excess cash does not wish to squander it . Study existing operations and remove the waste first . Prepare the organization for automation . The race goes not to the first to install robots but to the best overall effect . Automate only the necessary , value-adding operations and eliminate the rest . A company whose access to capital was limited by its financial arrangements , such as Harley-Davidson , can not spend much on capital equipment . Its approach is to work on the process and develop the people . Then , target automation so it contributes to elimination of waste and improvement of quality without adding overhead . It is a pay-as-you-go approach . Equipment does not have to become worse with age . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better able to perform its manufacturing mission than when it was new . If the equipment was designed to be maintained , wear and tear should be correctable ; and , if the machine is carefully studied with respect to its mission , modifications to fit the purpose should make it perform better than when new . An entrepreneur starting a new manufacturing business can seldom do so with all new equipment . The necessary investment base would be too high . The competition is using a mix of equipment , some new , some already written off , and if all new equipment is selected , its advantage over old must be great .  | Skill makes the difference . There is no substitute for understanding the equipment , automated or not ? how to operate it , how to maintain it , how to modify it in small ways for specific tasks . Computerized equipment requires computer " jockeys " in the same way that other equipment requires operators and maintenance personnel who understand it . They understand the quirks of specific machines in specific locations assigned to specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics assigned to a specific car on a racing team become one with the machine . No one gets a major automation project down right the first time . Even if they do , conditions change ? product lines , part volumes , part configurations , etc . Therefore , flexibility is important . Flexibility is attained in several ways , starting with volume flexibility . A very smart idea is to design a plant to have a very low breakeven point so as not to create a monster that demands to be fed . A second way is to incorporate general equipment as much as possible . Special equipment ? designed for a specific part ? is useless if the part is no longer used by your company or by another to whom the machine can be sold . Design floors and locate utilities so machines are movable without breaking the treasury . A third way to achieve flexibility is to avoid great reliance on technical adventure . New technology involves risk , and some must be taken to make progress . However , attempting technical advance on a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy can fulfill . Try it a piece at a time if possible . The purpose of a factory is reliable , low-waste production , and a great one does not have to be state of the art in all technology at once . Finally , flexibility is bounded . No factory can do everything equally well . A very important decision is the mission statement for production : What shall be produced . What shall be purchased . What range of work shall be encompassed . There is a limit , and stating clearly what a plant will prepare itself to do crystalizes effort . By exclusion , it will not fritter effort by attempting too much . For instance , a common problem in mature companies is attempting to make spare parts for ancient products in the same areas used for current production . The original equipment , tooling , and knowhow are no longer present , so define a secondary area for such parts or farm them out . ( It sometimes is a great business for retirees. )  | Setup Time Reduction Setup times are frequently cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that is , having everything in preparation when time comes for the setup to be executed . ( Setup time is the downtime of the operation to change from one part or product to another ; but , to reduce setup times , one should also remove the waste from the setup process by reducing the labor required for them . ) Setup time reduction relates to everything else . An example from an actual press department forming some simple metal parts is easily understood . Times have been reduced from an hour down to 10 minutes , and they are shooting for 5 . First they found that die adjustment took a long time because gauge variation in the steel was high and so they had to tweak to compensate . Someone had found a good deal on steel coils . Improved steel cost more but was easily paid for by scrap reduction and the increased time between die maintenance . Then they assigned specific dies to specific presses , located them for easy access , and made other revisions to decrease the physical work and time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies and presses . Now they are working on establishing a daily schedule for regular times to set up , and they are working on standardizing die heights to further reduce adjustment time . Everybody learned a lot and continues to do so . Over time , a 90 percent reduction in setup times is not unreasonable . Half or more comes from workplace organization making ready for readiness for setup change as soon as the machine stops . Think of setup as a standard activity to be performed as a routine ? the difference between changing a tire on a passenger car for the first time in five years and changing one in a pit stop during an auto race . One common problem is to think of machines independently for setup time reduction , so only one or two machines are selected for trial . That does little good if the operations feeding those machines still have large lot sizes and if output is demanded of them in large lot sizes . Think of reducing setup times through a complete flow of production . Another problem is not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will concoct many inexpensive ideas for  | setup time reduction once they understand it is important and once the problem is clarified , but this can not be done if they can not anticipate what part is to be produced on which machine . The issues revert to quality , maintenance , schedule stability ? and to workplace organization . Most common is that tooling and tooling maintenance must be shaped up to permit fast setups . If deficient , it will at first be seen as an overwhelming obstacle . If tooling is so poorly designed or so worn that every setup must make compensating adjustments , refurbishment of tooling can be so time consuming and expensive that setup time reduction will be a long time coming . Go for quality in setup first . Study of setups goes to the heart of production skills . A big difference exists between having just enough skill ( and desire ) to patch together tooling and equipment and developing the skill for defect-free , quick-setup production . Usually , technicians and operators must go through a process of self-improvement and selfdiscovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who must work with it . Once tooling comes up to snuff and workplace organization is under way , ideas for setup time reduction by modifying equipment begin to pop . Other ideas to eliminate adjustment time are generated . Try to make the first piece produced a good one . Locate gauges and instruments nearby so those doing the setup can check the first piece immediately . If current practice is to check the first piece by an inspector , an organizational obstacle must be breached . Focus on how to enable operators or others to assume this responsibility , not on the reasons why that should not be done . Underlying the whole effort is a process of skill and confidence development . If possible , locate gauges and instruments so that long , timeconsuming walks to check parts are eliminated . The author visited a press shop in which operators carried the parts to a distant quality office for a gauge check , then waited for the results . Each trip averaged two hours . A full setup should have taken 10 minutes or less if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine operator was trying to set up a machine to a one-thousandth tolerance using a six-inch rule , then taking a trial piece to a distant optical gauge for verification .  | Practice and timing are important . If operators and technicians set up the same machine and tooling for the same part numbers every week , they soon become good at it , and being good at it requires a standard procedure . If they are constantly surprised by schedule changes , they soon become discouraged . Timing and repetition allow everyone to get setup down pat . Refine it using cycle time analysis . Do not turn setup time reduction over to manufacturing engineers . They will make a specialized problem of it and probably spend too much money doing so . Reserve their talent for where it is really needed , and the true engineering challenges should keep them busy . The operators and technicians need to develop . That is part of the purpose , and besides , they are likely to develop a succession of simple , inexpensive ideas that will accumulate to a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they fail , try again . That is part of the learning ? as long as it is not overly expensive . A great deal has been written about setup time reduction , and nuts-and-bolts ideas abound . One should not throw up the hands , saying that a complex machine tool is an impossible challenge . It is more difficult than a small press , and perhaps a setup time in under 10 minutes is not possible , but make an effort anyway . Mind over matter accomplishes a great deal . Layout for Improvement One of the first ways to begin capturing the " effect of automation " is to change the layout to minimize travel distances of material , tooling , and people . Many plants assume that they must operate by a job shop layout , with all equipment and operations of the same type located together in the same department . The problem of locating job shop departments to minimize travel distances has been studied to death . The big gains come from questioning this assumption and locating operations in the sequence in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how work is done and how layouts are constructed in detail . Some of the issues are : common routings for families of parts , exceptions to those , and the reasons ; dirt and contamination , such as from heat-treating and painting operations ;  | noise and vibration ; location of tooling and gauges or other instruments . Those are the physical problems . The organizational problem is that the advantage of locating people of similar skills in one area will be lost . If departments are broken up , the issues of special skills and training must be faced squarely . Often these are not as great as was feared , and they are offset by the advantage of immediate feedback and visibility of total operations . The core problem may well be the status systems built up by isolated specialists in different departments . Breaking these systems is difficult even if people can readily observe that skill maintenance problems can be whipped . Another tough problem is equipment selection and modification over a long period of time . Equipment intended to be used in-line will be selected if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently placed . If it is located in a department of similar equipment , thinking of it as a stop on a " standard routing " will be less likely . Try to clarify the specific mission of equipment by in-line layout , if possible ; but if not , think of equipment as part of a flow anyway ? except as widely separated stops in a flow . Develop a layout for standard conditions before exceptions . All layouts have compromises , but try as best as possible to : ? Simplify flows . Material flow one way ; tooling in a crossflow . Tooling is sometimes a much bigger material handling problem than material . ? Minimize material handling , and keep it simple . Avoid lifting , by worker or by machine . Keep lift trucks out of the operation 's core . Close up space between equipment . ? Make use of people 100 percent . Provide a layout that promotes visibility and flexibility . Ability to respond is a big human advantage . Figure 5 ? 1 sketches several different layouts that promote flexibility . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subtracting people and promotes their trading work between them . Rather than attempting to balance work between people so that all share an equal load but most are underloaded ( bottleneck ) , try to shift work so that all work at a full pace save one . Pick a skillful one to be off-loaded . That one will likely find a way to further shift  | or reduce work so as to become unnecessary ( once the idea is understood ) and therefore useful on another job . Many simple layout ideas contribute to eliminating waste . A halfstep here , a reach avoided there , and a double-handling eliminated somewhere else begin to add up . Layouts also contribute to JIT . Much of what passes for miraculous scheduling is actually a cumulation of skillful work developing people and layout to do what is necessary when necessary ; and much of the preparation of people for JIT is teaching them how to improve their work methods and layout to handle the problems of mixed model assembly , for instance .  | Suppose that one could concoct a wondrously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of printed circuit boards used in dozens of end products . Getting all the material and tooling into the machine and away from it would be quite a problem . Computer systems might keep track of thousands of parts , but the physical layout would be exceedingly complex . The point of this exaggeration is that layout complications in production ( not just automation ) should be a warning that the fundamental concept of the process is flawed . A great deal of automation is only moving something . An ingenious layout goes far to prevent automating a great deal of motion that should really be unnecessary . The value of intense effort integrating operations into an effective , low-waste layout is greatly underestimated . In a well-developed JIT operation , little is said about the problems of scheduling . Instead , much is observed about adjusting work and layouts in order to make any " reasonable " schedule possible to run . Observe how much space is taken for operations that do not add value directly to production . Offices encroach on production space . Room is taken for material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not unusual for a plant covering thousands of square feet to use only 15 to 20 percent of the space for firsttime material conversion . Even in the direct production areas , spacing between machines is often left wide to accommodate various problems . Extra space in a plant is like extra space in a garage at home . It will soon be occupied with something . By concentrating on workplace organization , quality improvement , and common flow paths , most plants can open up space no one realized it had ? often 10 to 20 percent in short order , and up to 50 percent longer term . Much of automation 's intent is to capture the precise location and orientation of tools and material and maintain them without exception throughout production . Another major objective of automation is to perform various quality checks without losing locational control of material . If these objectives can be attained in simple , inexpensive ways , much of automation 's effect is obtained anyway ? by developing detailed improvements in layouts , quality , and methods of work .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating cost savings go on and on and include avoidance of wasteful automation . They derive from reduction in material handling , better visibility , and prompt attention to problems . Excellent layout is integration of operations in detail . Office planning is also a factor . If office space is not provided , excess staff is hard to accumulate . Likewise , offices close to the operations promote visibility . It is very easy for managers and staff to work under a plant roof but rarely see the production operations themselves or , if they do , only a minute portion . If visibility is important for workers and supervisors , it is important for managers and staff also . The Cell One of the best ways to reduce material handling is to perform as much value-added work as possible in one spot . Multiple operations can take place on one machine , for example , multistage ( progressive ) dies in one press and multiaxis machine tools . However , the added complexity of doing it all on one machine may add significantly to setup time , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if technically and economically feasible , doing it all on one machine is a good idea . A cell of machines in which parts move one at a time from machine to machine is better for some purposes . Each machine may be easier to set up , the overall cost lower , and the cycle time working on each part shorter . As a simple example , consider a fiveaxis machine that will perform all the operations that five simple machines will do . Suppose the five-axis machine costs $1 million and takes two hours to set up . The five simple machines cost $100,000 each and require 10 minutes each to set up . Combined into a cell , they process parts in one third the time . Even if the cell takes an extra operator , the choice is obvious if the same quality results and the same maintenance time is required . That is the basic idea and advantage of a cell . This example was oversimplified , but grouping operations into cells is an idea worth considerable investigation . A cell generally requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators can be a sticking point , but the overall idea is to develop people , so work toward diversification .  | Some of the machines in a cell are probably not used to their capacity , which is a concern if machines are expensive and a reason to avoid expensive equipment when possible . It is not use of individual machines but rather the overall effect that counts . The overall effect is to ( 1 ) greatly shorten lead times of material through production and ( 2 ) provide excellent visibility and immediate feedback among the operations in the cell . Why is so simple an idea not widely used ? Unless the idea of cell production is in the mind from the beginning , conversion to it seems difficult , if not impossible . Product design and process development have not worked toward it . Operations have been developed independently . Individual engineers design one part at a time without much reference to how the part fits into a family of parts , all of which may be made in almost the same way . Machines are selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some are easily maintained ; others have considerable downtime . A different mix of parts has been assigned to each one . Then , equipment proposed for a cell is used for items that do not go through the cell . The interference destroys smooth flow . A breakdown on one machine hangs up production for all . Piece-ata-time transfer of parts between machines that run at different rates is possible but results in a high percentage of idle time for the fastest machines . These problems may or may not be technically surmountable . Those in the mindset are the hardest . One is the urge to run a machine at its fastest rate even if the volume of parts needed from it is so low that the machine is otherwise idle most of the time . The cost system presumes independent operations , so the cost for running machines in a cell will appear to sum to a higher cost than if they were run independently due to multiplied downtime and so on . The overhead cost required to run independently is fuzzy to estimate . Continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for manufacturing engineers in the short run , and design engineers can continue working independently if they have little discipline for standardization . Those companies with available technical firepower are inclined to engineer through all of this . Redesign it , computerize it , simulate it , and start over , which is very good provided the cost is not too high and the original mindset is not still there waiting to hobble the technical achievement .  | Evolution to a cell may work better , provided the equipment is simple enough to do it . This route has two major advantages . First , the experimentation is with the real thing , so problems of quality , layout , and work flow are worked out directly , debugging your way through it as you go . Second , chances are good not to make a slip up that prevents flexible use of the cell . A very simple way to connect equipment with fixed work cycles so as to have a variable rate of output is shown in Table 5 ? 1 and Figure 5 ? 2 . ( This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Kamigo engine plants . ) The cumulative manmachine chart is a basic version of the kinds of analysis methods used for thorough cycle time analysis ( Chapter 4 ) . Continuously working away at cycle time analysis wrings the waste out of these operations . This approach is the fundamental method for carefully studying total operations before spending big money on equipment . Needless to say , the entire work force must be developed for it . They must learn to think continuous improvement continuously . After they do , they are tough to beat with a straight engineering approach . U-Lines A simple cell has equipment tightly arranged in a U-shape within which workpieces move one at a time from station to station around the U , usually by one or more workers inside the cell . This is useful for parts small enough to easily hand-carry and when using simple machines small enough that operators have easy access . Most equipment can be modified to go through a processing cycle without the operator watching . A large U-Line might have 30 machines and two or three operators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreasing the number of operators ; and , if equipment is simple , the operators can change over the entire cell to another part in 15 minutes or so . The first technical throught is , why not move the parts by robot ? Perhaps that can be done , but whether it is useful is another consideration . If a robot were used , would a human have to be present to monitor the cell anyway ? Would a technician need to give full attention to keep the equipment running ? An operator " walking the beat " inside the cell performs the monitoring function , constantly observing both parts and equipment , close up and firsthand . And this kind of cell can be developed with simple modifications  | Flexible Manufacturing Systems The term flexible manufacturing system designates a system of machines under centralized computer control served by automated computer-controlled material handling equipment . Workpieces may move in sequence from machine to machine , or work may simply be assigned to the necessary machine when it is open . In practice , an FMS generally consists of a computer-controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its associated load/unload equipment and an automated storage-andretrieval system for material and sometimes for tools . Often the workpieces are too heavy for human lifting . Sometimes flexible machining cells work well ; sometimes not . The difference comes down to whether the company can overcome the same kinds of technical and human issues associated with other kinds of cells . Fundamentals of people preparation , quality , layout , maintenance , and so forth make the difference . Both computerization and the price tag make the FMS high profile in management attention , but the success factors are buried back in low-profile activity . Think of the Entire Plant as a Cell This is one way to stimulate thinking about operations as a whole and not piecemeal . Operating an entire plant using workplace organization and high-visibility practices creates that overall effect . It may not be quite as closely meshed as material moving through a set of machines organized into a cell , but the results are similar . The objectives of revising an entire production facility are the same as for creating any individual cell : minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This suggests the overall effect desired . The considerations in obtaining it are similar ; the problems much the same except the entire plant is a bigger arena . Can the product be designed with families of parts having similar operations in production ? Can the operations for existing designs be organized into a standard sequence ? Can such problems as a central heat treat facility be worked around in some way ? Operators and support personnel developed ? The schedule stabilized into a repetitive pattern for it ?  | At one company with an 18-person operation , engineers figured out how to accomplish the same tasks with six operators and four robots . They were busy trying to justify four robots on the basis of decreased labor for 12 people . After considering how they might further improve the work using cell arrangements , they found they could do it all with four operators and no robots . Now that is the idea . The essential pattern of thinking is to stop considering operations independently and start thinking from the very inception of product concept how operations might all fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to defining in a thoughtful way what the manufacturing mission of a plant should be . If a cell can not be developed with clarity in mission , neither can a plant be . Missions inevitably change with the evolution of markets and products , so this is not a one-time decision for the ongoing business . Performance Measurement for Plants and Equipment The major problem with most existing performance measures is that they assume operations are independent . Take equipment utilization , for instance . If the utilization of every piece of equipment is measured independently , and if managers are seriously asked to keep the utilization high , the motivation is to run every active piece of equipment as much as possible whether production is needed or not . The actual measurement is a lesser problem than how it is used to motivate performance . If production supervisors are driven by it , they do not want to shut down equipment until they have to ( meaning that they can find no more work to put on it ) . If a machine is running well , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and material hold out . They assign to each machine the operator who is most likely to maximize output from it and reassign them reluctantly . ( Labor efficiency motivates in a similar way . ) This motivation is the opposite of almost everything desirable . Managers so motivated can not put heart and soul into making frequent setup changes , nor will they take seriously a policy of shutting down at regular times for tool changes , quality checks , or preventive maintenance .  | Harley-Davidson adopted the correct solution for this problem . Management threw the equipment utilization report into the trash can and instead measures equipment availability . Will the equipment do what it is supposed to do when needed ? There is no point in running equipment just to run it . Measuring equipment availability stimulates preventive maintenance and is consistent with process improvement and crosstraining of operators . ( One major reason for equipment downtime is that no operator capable of running it is available . ) Other performance measures must be suggested , with the caveat that all such things are subject to the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Number of setups per month for particular pieces of equipment or for departments . The objective is not to maximize this but to hit a target that makes sense for the current schedule and the state of development for flow production and quality . One also can not exceed the total labor available to make setups. 2 . Process capability . Is process capability within the necessary range ? Number of operations failsafed where desirable . 3 . Flexibility . Number of operators capable of operating each piece of equipment , for example . Number of technicians capable of servicing each one . One can measure to death and still not know much . Workplace organization is judged by seeing it . Selecting a few measures compatible with heading in the desired direction is useful , but hundreds of them add to the data collection effort without contributing much except the waste of collection . The Virtues of Inexpensive Equipment Inexpensive equipment comes with little obligation to use it . Managers do not strain to obtain an ROI or a payback from it as an individual piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , to be used or not as need be . The most important part of tooling and equipment ? no matter how automated and advanced ? is the people associated with it . American combat flying is considered superior because of both superior training and superior equipment ; but , of the two factors ,  | superior training and experience of air crews and support crews are the most important . The best crews show well even if their equipment lacks the latest technology . There is no reason to think otherwise of production personnel and their equipment . Defect-free production using no-frills tooling and equipment is achieved through people skill . By it , equipment is adapted to new missions , and experience is formed on what is really important in assembling the tooling and equipment for new work . By working first to upgrade and modify equipment already owned , expenditure for more is minimized . With equipment and tooling cost at minimum , break-even points are low , which decreases risk in a business downturn . It also reduces incentive to keep equipment running so that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hopefully will be needed in the future . Gambling to pay off a high-stakes equipment investment with a higher stake in inventory buildup is an adventuresome risk . Flexibility is derived from the attributes of the equipment , tooling , and people , and it is promoted by low investment , but smart investment , trying to stay flexible so as to quickly put together an arrangement to produce what is needed on short notice . An assortment of simple equipment that can be quickly rearranged within a U-line cell is a prime example . Inexpensive equipment can be held in reserve for substitution while modifications and improvements are made to on-line counterparts . The policy of assigning the same parts to the same machine seems in conflict with this ( and partly is ) because changing machines is one more source of quality variance to deal with . However , there is a difference between planned substitutions for improvement and haphazard changes for whims and emergencies . Also , if no pressure is exerted to run equipment full out , different pieces of equipment can be made to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay added to each cycle to slow them to the speed of the slower pieces ; or , even better , the complete series of equipment can be adjusted to run at the rate production is needed . Idle time on equipment is accumulated that way but , if the output is not needed , so what ? Inexpensive equipment is easier to regard as part of a set of equipment . Inexpensive operations are easier to regard as a unified whole , not as a collection of independent activities , some scrutinized to death and some virtually ignored .  | Operations are not independent , but management thinking often assumes they are . Plant efficiency is assumed to be the sum of efficiencies of independent operations , but if operations are not independent , the criterion that counts is whether the plant as a whole made what was needed without error , on time , and at low cost . Accounting models state that aggregate costs are the sum of independent costs , which is true for the model , but it does not follow that the operations on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE An assumption too often made is that equipment must become less fit for use as it ages . Its purchase cost has depreciated to salvage value , so the machine must have done likewise . Unless a machine was poorly designed for maintenance from the start , that assumpion is not true . If worn parts can be replaced , the machine should not only be as good as new but better . Most machines are used for a particular application . They are modified and continuously improved to perform that application better . If they are well used and maintained , they should be better for their purpose after 5 or 10 years than when they were new . Obsolescence is a different issue . Perhaps a differently designed piece of equipment can perform the same task with less waste , or perhaps through technology the tasks for which the machine was originally developed are no longer needed ? the process is obsolete . Then the machine is either junk or a museum piece , but not before . Preventive maintenance ( PM ) is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many PM programs fade away bcause this concept is not properly understood . In a plant where emergency production always prevails , time for maintenance comes last . The machines most critically needed will not be shut down until maintenance is no longer preventive but instead necessary . If preventive maintenance is understood only as an insurance program , it is analyzed as a trade-off . Is it worth $100 per week for three years to delay an overhaul for one year or to prevent a catastrophic malfunction at an unexpected time ? If there is pressure to produce , even an answer in the affirmative will be deferred . The real reason for preventive maintenance is to preserve the process capability of the equipment and tooling . If that is done ,  | the equipment must also be preserved from excess wear and tear , and the standard of excellence to which each machine must be maintained will allow failsafe production of quality output . Preventive maintenance is one of the quality cycles to which many production operations are subjected . Oiling equipment once a week is inadequate PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as machines . A regular program to keep all instruments and gauges in calibration is one of the most important aspects of total quality . Without accurate measurement , the process capability of everything else is endangered . This is one of the most vital areas for preventive maintenance according to quality cycles appropriate to each instrument . If this action has not already been taken when starting total quality , it should be one of the first . A sign of a well-run plant is an excellent visibility system to assure that readings from all measuring instruments are kept calibrated and that the same kinds of instruments are as identical as possible . ( Inattention to calibration is one of the most common " black holes " in plant quality issues . ) Operator participation in equipment PM is highly desirable . Operators who help care for equipment understand it better , and they are less likely to abuse it . Those who clean see things missed by those who do not , and they become sensitive to any minute change in sound or motion that signifies a potential deviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than regularly keeping equipment and tooling up to snuff . Those who maintain the equipment learn it thoroughly . They have more ideas on how to modify it for improvement . A plant with good internal capability to maintain and modify equipment is a leg up when it comes to revising equipment for setup time reduction , cell production , and other purposes . They can keep the equipment at the necessary level of process capability , and they can use it in a flexible manner . Preventive maintenance should be one objective of a visibility system . Put cards or logs on machines so that operators can note suspicious functioning that they can not tend to themselves . The logs also keep the maintenance history right on the machine , which helps . A way to note that a machine , tool , or instrument has been tended by maintenance is to put a colored sticker on it . An old sticker shows it has not received attention , and the stickers easily denote machines that need it , even from a distance .  | One of the toughest problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who makes rounds of machines that seldom have anything wrong with them can lapse into dry running it ? change the sticker without doing anything . Making PM a quality program prevents this . The technician must record something checkable , for instance , bearing wobble . Working to improve process capability and make the machines better instead of just keeping them going reduces the incentive to dry run . A good test of total work force skill is to check what equipment in a plant can be disassembled and put back together without disturbing process capability . In fact , it might come out better . A skilled group can do a great deal , but this status is not quickly and easily attained . As more and more computerized equipment is used , software maintenance becomes a major part of maintenance in general . Preventive maintenance is important for software also . As much waste proliferates from poor software as from poor hardware . In addition to manufacturing support systems , software is directly associated with shop floor equipment ? everything from numerical control tapes to programs downloaded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and PM activities is useful for software too . Visibility methods to patrol the current maintenance status of software are a little more subtle than with hardware , but possible . Preventive maintenance of data bases is generally considered measures for data accuracy . Issues in software maintenance are well-known , but a brief review of a few of them holds great similarity to issues in PM for complex equipment : Documentation of current status is vital . The same is true of complex equipment . The best place for documentation is imbedded in the software itself . Same with equipment . Knowing what you see when viewing it directly is best . Separate manuals help , but they too need regular periods for PM ? regular reissues . It helps to simplify them , standardize them , and have a regular time set aside to update them . Software often needs constant attention for enhancement and to keep current with hardware and interfaces . The same with complex equipment , and the more so if its use is intended to be flexible . Computer and software maintenance is mainly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnose software quickly is important even if it is well documented . Production equipment of all kinds needs the same , and cross-training technicians is a problem that strains resources and taxes the ingenuity of management . Software is written in different languages in which not all programmers are expert . Complex equipment has electronics , software , hydraulics , mechanics ? everything ; thus learning the whole thing in detail is a challenge . Security is an issue . Software can be damaged or stolen , sometimes unintentionally . However , keeping it in a secure place far from the action does nothing to assist flexibility or immediate feedback ? or maintenance and corrective action if visualizing the problem is helpful to the process , which may be true of shop floor software . Little genius is needed to see that the potential for waste can multiply rapidly with complex equipment . In highly automated facilities , the common denominator is that a corps of technicians familiar with the complex equipment is the heart of the operation . Simplifying this situation reduces the potential for waste , much of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood by few . PRODUCT DESIGN Tremendous potential exists in designing a product to be easily made . A major automation project generally calls for a redesign of the product to standardize and simplify the parts . Few parts and simple geometry are easier handled by robots , and perhaps automatic fabrication and assembly is simplified . However , after simplifying product design for automation , the same changes have sometimes made manual work so easy that automation was unnecessary ? economically unjustifiable ? in more than one case . This did not deter at least one company from going ahead with automation , however . Having set its mind on robots , it was determined to have them . If redesign is of great benefit in simplifying and standardizing for automation , it is also beneficial if the actual automation never takes place . It helps promote production changes that provide the same benefit without the equipment . Rethinking the product design  | is part of studying the total manufacturing process before spending money on equipment . Produceability is an oft-neglected aspect of product design , but it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what the user wants , be fit for use with no gremlins waiting to cause product liability problems , be durable , have an attractive appearance , and be maintainable without a total teardown . Most products also have to be transported to their place of use and sometimes stored and identified at various points along the way . Packaging is the most important part of some products . Finally , users must understand how to use it properly , so directions and manuals are also part of the total product consideration . Put all this together , and much design engineering is a highly integrative activity . For many products , even technically advanced ones , only a small portion of the design work is nontextbook ideas . That is the exciting part for most engineers , but a great deal of their work is extension of well-known past practice to different applications . Much of this extension is integrating all these considerations into the specific physics , geometry , and procedures to be produced and marketed ? and making sure it all is going to work . Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical aspects of their work that they give too little thought for how everything will fit together in their own organization and in the field . To achieve manufacturing excellence , the entire responsibility of design engineering should be well done ? total integration . Otherwise , production is a turmoil of conflict and engineering change . As we observed , issues relating to quality begin with the design concept . Converting this concept to a clear set of quality specifications is one responsibility of product design and development . Begin with a clear set of goals for the product design from the viewpoint of the user . Product ideas may not originate in design engineering . Often they are the offspring of ideas coming from marketing or field service . Certainly the desired features of a new product in a large company are greatly influenced by the observations and data collected by marketing . Specifications are confounded if the product concept is influenced by a number of parties who do not agree . Not much energy is left to make the product easy to produce . One of the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xerox in the copier business . The objectives :  | Make the image at least equal in quality and the operating speed at least the same . Make it half the size and to sell at half the cost . Such objectives are challenging but clear . Whether they are met or not is easily seen , and the cost objective presses for a design easy to produce . It also creates much thought for low-cost methods of distribution and selling . Had the objectives pressed for a major advance in image quality or duplicating speed , the produceability objective might not have been so dominant , but it should have been present and clear nonetheless . For instance , make it sell for no more than competitive price . If that objective is unstated , production methods tend to be ignored until technical ones are met , which will then necessitate some revising ? the classic case of " throwing the design over the wall " to production . Neglecting production considerations until late in the design work delays actual product introduction and is likely to result in a messy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an environment in which cost is a driving factor and in which pricing is an aggressive bet on the outcome of a production learning curve . Design a product as far down a learning curve as possible . Sometimes new production technology must be used to produce a newly developed product , but learning both a new product and a new production technology at the same time compounds problems . A wiser policy is to keep learning in bite-sized chunks by developing new products and new processes in different cycles to the extent possible . Design new products to fit established production processes , and change production technologies in anticipation of new product requirements . The usual solution advanced for improving the produceability of designs is to move production engineers , purchasing representatives , and materials specialists further forward in the design process . Include them in the design team . If that is done , why not have the design team composed of marketing and distribution specialists also ? Soon the design team becomes large and cumbersome , while a small group would enhance communication . Nothing replaces having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about them during a design project . Managing a large design team is harder than managing a small one , and if the number of meetings required exponentiates , the total design process stretches ? not what anyone had in mind . Again , the best solution appears to involve the development of  | people . For manufacturing excellence , a multiskilled staff is as important as multifunctional workers . Simplifying Design One major way to reduce cost is to have fewer parts : fewer parts in total and fewer different kinds of parts . Forty percent fewer parts is less work in assembly , less work in fabrication , less work in finding sources for material , and fewer quality details to tend ? provided the parts reduction is made without creating a complex wonder out of some of the parts so that degree of production difficulty offsets the reduction in part count . A division of Tektronix found that it had a proliferation of different fasteners in its product designs . No one had ever told designers that standardization of fasteners was important . A committee formed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would serve almost all applications . These were mounted on a display board in design areas so a designer looking for a fastener had an easy reference . Selecting a fastener in this way is easier than every designer searching through all the variety in the world , and the result was a great reduction in the number of different parts in Tektronix designs . This move greatly simplified purchasing of fasteners . It reduced the number of parts to be managed in Tektronix 's materials system . It reduced inventory . Best , it reduced delays in production caused by lack of some small part or other . Fasteners are seldom an integral item in the technical functioning of an electronics design . Parts custom-designed for product function are harder to standardize . Group technology attempts to solve this problem by classifying parts according to size , geometry , or function so designers can use existing parts instead of creating something new ? and different . In practice , group technology has had mixed success . Some designers may prefer their own unique imprint on the design . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . In the absence of a design policy , designers select few common parts because the intent of design is to fill a void in the product line ? something different . Everything comes out " an eighthinch off . "  | An example of a design policy for home appliances is to design each one around a family of standard motors and shafts . Then at least some of the most expensive parts will be standard . If standard parts are not possible , try to simplify design using a protocol such as the UMASS system of design for assembly . Alternatively , programs in conjunction with computer-aided design can assist with design simplification . In straight-flow production , if newly designed parts follow the same sequence of operations ( or one that can be quickly set up ) , introduction is much smoother . Computer-aided process planning helps identify ( but does not resolve ) the " design traps " in which one can be cornered . Typical is a metal part that requires a hardening process for which a plant is not equipped . Not only might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current parts are induction-hardened as part of the flow , but the options are to get a new piece of equipment ( and learn a new process ) or send out the part for treatment . Either choice wins a raspberry for the designer . Design traps can be minimized by a policy of designing all similar products to the established process ? unless a conscious decision has been made to change the process . Naturally , exceptions will exist , but the policy coupled with design reviews can head off unnecessary problems . Establishing such a design policy presumes that the existing production operations sequence ( or standard routing ) is definable . This comes down to a chicken-and-egg question : Define basic process routings for designers first ; otherwise , standard routings do not develop because designs do not call for them , and vice-versa . Critics of this approach assume that it stifles creativity . It does . Not all creativity comes to a practical end . Much more is involved in innovating a new technology than in inventing the bare-bones working model . The rest is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the total process of refining it , producing it , educating users , persuading , and perhaps breaking old habits of thought . Technical progress does not come from technical chaos . It might start from chaos , but the rewards go to those who organize the total environment for it . Productivity should improve in engineering as well as in the rest of the organization . As production processes and methods evolve , so do the design policies based on them ? a symbiotic process . A company in pursuit  | of radical technology must take the risk of breaking the old shell that traps it in old process technology , but it must form a new one ? or be beaten down the learning curve by competitors who do . Structuring of Options The basic problem is variety of product attractive to a spectrum of users while retaining operations as simple as possible throughout the company . Conventionally , if a basic design made to stock is modified for options , each modification is a different model . If a product is made to order , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order from predetermined parts , not custom-designed parts . Some options are special adjustment settings or special software . Optioned products cover a wide spectrum : automobiles , machine tools , computers , office furniture , pumps ? even commercialgrade door hardware . Structuring the options is a major part of making a product line competitive . Everyone would like to present customers with something they want ( or think they want ) , but presenting them economically is how to stay in business while doing it . Structuring options is an extension of design policy . Engineering policies desirable when designing options are : 1 . Modular design . Create modules that can be separately fabricated , assembled , and tested . Make them correspond to different options that fit together interchangeably for final assembly and test . Option maintenance can then be reduced to replacement of modules . Developing a modular design structure is not so hard during original design . Retrofitting into it is tough . 2 . Sequential buildup . Try to design options that are simple , step-by-step buildups . Production flow does not have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is to be able to fabricate , assemble , and test streams of options for different customers without breaking rhythm . If fabrication of option parts is only substitution of tooling in a fast setup on the same equipment , that simplifies the situation . If options require a unique buildup for each different combination , the production situation is little different than if each order were custom designed . The objective of options is to provide the variety without this expense . Suppose a particular option requires  | special holes in the frame of a machine . When the option is to be fitted , access to drill the holes may be impossible without partial disassembly , which adds expense and potential for damage . Better to drill such holes when the frame is started ; better yet to drill all holes needed for any option when any frame is started . Best is to add any option without any special holes for it alone . Structuring options is very important for company communication . An order for an option should be unambiguous and therefore translatable into every activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a frame if needed . Option coding forms the basis for sales literature , order entry systems , materials systems , operation instructions , and cost systems . If either the engineering or systems coding of options is not well done , the company carries a huge burden and can not avoid waste in serving the customer . Excess communication is waste . Errors in communication are a quality problem . Some methods for coding modular bills of material and master build lists are ingenious , but complex options create problems . These are usually described with some mind-boggling number of combinatorial possibilities for all the options on one base-case product . Consequently , the production department suggests discontinuing unusual combinations , a solution vetoed by those who wish to please a broad market spectrum . No known definitive studies on the waste in dealing with options have been done ; however , according to companies that have them , the problems are : 1 . Options require more parts in total . More parts are harder to manage than fewer , and they complicate efforts to automate. 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-volume product . Their visibility is submerged , so getting the right part to the right place at the right time is hard . Forecasting them is more difficult . 3 . Options give people choices and opportunities to change their mind , and they do . It is easy to spend much time defining an order and then checking " if and when " optional use material can be obtained ? a customer-driven but material-constrained business . 4 . The pricing is complicated . Some options are high-margin while others are " toss-ins . " Much selling effort can be ex-  | plaining options or determining if what the customer wants is really suitable for their use . It complicates the customer 's choice . 5 . Problems with bills of material and option-coding systems seem to be : a . Interpreting conditions of use for parts and options ? communication of Boolian-type logic statements , which are combinations of " and-with-or-if and not . " b . Bills of material must be reflected in several different forms in different databases . Coordinating changes accurately is a maintenance problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , multiply referenced with different codings and numbering systems , refer to the long rack of catalogs across the counter of the neighborhood auto parts store . What would happen if making an accurate , coordinated change in all of them became necessary ? ) Despite the problems , customers want options ; thus the question is how to attract a customer base with options structured to produce and service them with little waste . There seems to be no one-answer-fits-all solution . It depends on the type of product and the purpose of the options . For some , perhaps , offering a base case loaded with newly standardized options makes sense . ( Then some customers will want stripped versions as options . ) Some options ( especially trim and hang-on ) may be added by a dealer or a service department . From an operations viewpoint , the best solution results in the simplest bills of material at all points in the total process . Most companies with high option content want positive bills of material ; that is , they want people and systems at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use , substitution possibilities , or condition-of-use restrictions . Just build what it says ? straight out . Doing this starts by simplifying how options are designed and built . Complex costing and pricing of options at best creates a valueadded cover for the issues for as long as the cover lasts . It does not address providing the product and service needed by the customer without waste . The way options are structured reflects how a company works , which can not be changed overnight . However , as the company improves its capability , the simplification of option structure will become both an opportunity and a necessity .  | The technical vision of the factory of the future is a plant operated as one big , computer-controlled cell . A part can be computer designed ( computer-aided design ) and its fabrication instructions can be generated by computer-aided manufacturing ( CAD/CAM ) . Then the correct material can be automatically selected and automatically moved through the computer-controlled equipment necessary to fabricate and assemble it . Along the way , the part will be subjected to computer-generated test procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CIM ) . Limited instances of CIM are working today , but a major software problem is linking all the various systems . In most companies , islands of automation operate independently of each other because the computer languages used by each can not traverse the gulf between them , but headway is being made on that problem also . General Motors ' manufacturing automation protocol is long step toward developing a standard software interface between machines and systems . Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is a phrase denoting software that replicates features of reasoning ; that is , it uses a set of decision rules to make limited judgments that go beyond just applying straightforward formulas to data . The best known " laboratory " versions are programs that play chess ? and win against all but the most expert human opponents . In many companies , a materials system and an accounting system using computers is old hat . Order entry is by computer . Distribution inventories are controlled by computer . Sometimes all these systems are rolled together into one big system with exchange of data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting , financial , and logistics data , perhaps into one grand approach called manufacturing resource planning . The potential in such approaches is great if the people using them can surmount the problems . Computer systems do not correct basic problems by themselves . People do , and more can be wasted with computers than without them . A technical discussion of CIM is beyond reach here . The key point is recognition that computerization of manufacturing provides technical possibilities to create waste as well as eliminate it . Managements sometimes incorrectly assume that automation is synonymous with manufacturing excellence . They are too much  | fascinated with the technology and too little fascinated with the totality of human development necessary to make it work well . A computer is a tool . AI is a tool . A robot is a tool . Linked together , automation still consists of tools ? to be used wisely or unwisely . If the name robot did not suggest humanoid characteristics , robots might be better applied as tools . In the end , people make anything work . Companies striving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership from the top and an integrated effort by all functions of the organization . People must learn to think in a new way . Computer-integrated manufacturing is really people-integrated manufacturing . People and process development come first ? pre-automation preparation . Computerization alone does not identify waste , correct many quality problems , rethink how to structure the design of a family of products , set a marketing strategy , or make suggestions for improvement . It does create need for disciplined integration such that these problems must be addressed if they can be seen through all the systems surrounding them . If basic disciplines can be achieved in a simple way , the expense of automating the waste can be avoided . Automate where waste is eliminated by doing so .  | Once sure of future direction , the most critical factor of success is development of people . As soon as they are ready , give the action point people responsibility and expect performance . Even if skill development has not progressed much , the change in work atmosphere produces improvement . A Navistar foundry improved quality by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job right . Workers at the final operation grind castings , inspect them , load them for shipment , and attach a quality certification tag , which they sign personally . The tag identifies the part and its source . It proclaims quality to the user and says that , in case of trouble , telephone the worker who signed the tag . Next to the grinders is a telephone ? the workers ' telephone . Now the workers know by telephone voice some of the people in far-off places who use their castings . Their interest in quality perked up . They do not hesitate to inform other workers in core room , furnace , or pouring when something is not right . Some of the " bureaucracy " of staff and supervisors between customers and workers is gone . Call it job enrichment , job enlargement , or what you will , the added responsibility did not increase the work cycle times of the direct workers and it was real participation , not a **41;1220;TOOLONG sham . The improved quality made their job easier , not harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " also , provided they understood . Management and staff acceptance of true worker responsibility comes hard . Most workers welcome the approach . It is better than  | being treated as a child , but they will naturally question the sincerity of management , and management doubts the capabilities of workers . Some workers may only be capable of limited development ; some are too immature to accept responsibility ; but in general , workers accept this change easier than management and staff do . The job of management and staff is to enable the direct-action people to perform better . That job is coaching , and coaching is development of others while developing yourself . Coaches teach , make correction , blend talent as a team , develop individual and collective skill , and motivate , but coaches do not play themselves . That is reserved for the players . Even planning and coordinating jobs should be done with intent to enable improvement and much of that ultimately by action-stage people . This is a matter of basic attitude . The objective of overhead functions in a business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is not to support the overhead , a deception easily inferred from the way costs are assembled . CLOSE TO THE ACTION Staff distant from the action grow to accept their daily rounds of reports and crisis chasing as the way work should be done . It all seems energetic and spirited , and so it all must be vitally important . Amid an ocean of waste , a vision of a world consisting of anything else is hard to come by . Staying close to the action can not be done with many people and little action . A lean staff is a busy staff . Lore has it that the nine-to-fiver will outperform the 60-hour-per-week staffer because the workaholic is probably dithering and disorganized . That assumption is dangerous . Suppose much of that time is spent figuring out how to make workers ever more effective ? " fighting a war , " not twiddling a system . Many hours on the job make communication easier . On the scene means in touch ? with action people and with others . Meetings are not put off because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those not present earlier . Telephone tag is reduced . Being there is much of the battle . In sportscasting parlance , it is called " presence . " In JIT/TQ plants , managers and staff should visit the operations regularly . If the plant floor is developed with workplace organi-  | zation , a staff person will see a lot when passing through . A plant manager will want to see more . Problems are understood firsthand rather than filtered through reports ? and those take someone 's time to prepare . A side benefit is achieved by expecting all managers to be in regular contact with action areas . Too many managers are obvious . Problem visibility applies to more than just shop floor operations . Regular meetings promote easy communication . A plant manager recently decided to hold an operations meeting every morning , just after the plant manager 's tour of the floor and before telephone prime time for everyone . Fear was that time would be wasted if no immediate problems were pending . As it turned out , many meetings were short but valuable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a good place for little side conversations that prevented the need for other meetings and phone calls . This management style fits the company warring on waste . If inventory is cut , the response time to correct problems is cut . Managing ongoing operations becomes more like managing an air traffic control tower . However , if the approach to management does not change , the reduction in inventory brings little benefit because the reform of management itself is the real goal . Incorporating automation does nothing to change this basic management approach . Those making the automation run are the action people , even if they rarely touch the product itself . A reason often given for automation from the " engineering mentality " is to rid the company of direct-labor problems . If by that they mean that there is no longer a place for someone semi-literate , there is some truth to it . If they believe that people problems will go away , they are wrong . People problems depend on the kind of people brought into the company and , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most difficult union-management problems in recent American history has been the air traffic controllers ? skilled work in a high-tech environment . Working for constant improvement takes close association with the action people no matter how technical the work . A company with enough cash may temporarily escape a bad labor relations history by moving a plant to a new location , either on-shore or off-shore , but it can not escape itself . In an industry  | where continuous improvement is the norm , the human side of managing must be mastered no matter where the action takes place , or by whom . Changing us is not as swift as changing location . RESPONSIBILITY AT THE SOURCE IS LINE MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP Manufacturing excellence requires line management leadership . The effort can not be integrated without it . Responsibility at the point of action demands it . Strong staffs have rivalries , and rivalries prevent an integrated point of view . Staff groups can create enthusiasm for total quality or just-in-time programs of one kind or another , but they can not reform the organization . If a staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is seen by others in narrow terms . If pushed by purchasing , it must only be a program for suppliers ; if by production control , it is only a different way to manage inventory ; if by manufacturing engineering , it must be an equipment project ; and so on . The staff members may have a broad concept of the total effort , but they can not bring all the pieces together . The result is a common phenomenon : " pockets of excellence . " A portion of a plant shows great improvement . Costs and quality improve on part of a product line , but the effort is confined because the surrounding environment can not support it . The pocket itself is in danger of collapse if the middle management champion is displaced . Momentum to continue a long-term , integrative change can only come from sustained line leadership at a high enough level to change the structure of organizations and the way people think . The more successful production area changes have had a common beginning . A group of people , including both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months while learning what to do . Then they went into the shop and started . A project leader might have coordinated , but the production managers and supervisors took a lead role . Without it , shop-level changes are stymied . If no more than this is done , " techniques are installed . " To get into the spirit of workplace organization , worker training and involvement must begin , else basic problem solving is not sufficiently transferred to the workers and supervisors themselves . That is responsibility at the source in production . To achieve it , the work-  | ers must increase both in knowledge and responsibility , and the supervisor 's role evolves to facilitating . A supervisor used to bossing around in detail can not accommodate to this easily , so supervisor preparation must preceed significant changes in the roles of workers . No supervisor wants to be thrust into something they do not understand mentally , and the " bossy " ones will have trouble emotionally . The basic nature of the problem is well known ? the age-old management problem of accepting delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but change the way they do it . Workers with responsibility must perform . A common fallacy is that participative management is permissive management . Not so . Workers performing as a team tend to exercise a certain amount of peer pressure , which helps discipline . Someone who must always have a fellow worker cover them will probably hear about it from peers , and that strategy works for many . Flagrant nonperformance has to be dealt with by the supervisor , however , and failure to do so demoralizes the rest of a work group who are really trying . Manufacturing excellence and participatory management are no cure for every shortcoming of people at work . Alcoholism , divorce , and disinterest for other reasons do not go away . This change is easiest for production supervisors to understand as maturing into delegation of responsibility ? a higher-level management approach . In any case , the transition is tough , an egobreaking experience for some . Not all are able to make the change , and a barrier to progress in several companies has been the time required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensating factor is that fewer full-time supervisors may be required . If production firefighting decreases , a major time consumption for supervisors goes away . They have more time to pay attention to people problems ? and to work out how to do the job better . A full-time supervisor can be augmented by several lead workers for large groups . The initial changes usually begin in production , and the most successful have been characterized by strong leadership and action . Less successful ones are characterized by much training and planning but little doing . Both the training and the action are important . The best training is followed very quickly by doing because people learn best by doing . ( Japanese companies going this route refer to  | " dirty instruction " : hands-on , show-how sessions first , followed by doing , and finally by explanations of why the approaches work . This method seems to work well in other cultures , too . ) Integration of Effort Management excellence can not come from fragmented contributions by various functional staffs ; that is , if quality assurance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an inventory program , and so on . Each staff seeks to impose another set of techniques , each set demanding adjustments and attention from an already choked line organization . Only so much can be assimilated at a time , and it should be cohesive . To keep from choking , line management must maintain consistent direction . Staffs need to be integrative in planning , which is no small demand for those steeped in their own specialties and which implies much about the personnel management of staff groups . No human can be omniscient , but most can acquire a perspective from different points of view , and by asking them to work directly with workers and line people , they also stay in touch with reality . As observed earlier , design engineers have a highly integrative role unrecognized by many . Though stereotyped , they are perhaps no worse than other staff specialists . Perspective may broaden from training programs but , practically speaking , experience with other functions in their own company is better . If they have spent time with real customers and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if they are , say , the world experts in ultrasonic effect on crystallization , designers need to know how to apply their knowledge to something buildable and marketable . The argument for cloistering specialists is that concentration builds their expertise . However , an old stream of research on scientists and engineers indicates that researchers are more productive when they have a diversity of interests . ' A little broadening may prevent them from going flat and certainly assists in creating something that needs less rework by the rest of the organization . Perhaps the same can be said of other staff specialists . Japanese are good integrators . One reason is wholistic thinking , born of Oriental religions and expressed in management as a con'Pelz and Andrews , Scientists in Organizations ( New York : John Wiley &; Sons , 1966 ) .  | sciousness of how one 's immediate activity relates to the whole . Meetings often start with the obligatory recitation of overall objectives ( to put minds on the same track ) then plod through a diagram ? incredibly detailed by American standards ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the human mind is finite , this thinking process simplifies much detail to make it fit together . If left undone , organizational detail sprawls in all directions . Americans are accustomed to thinking that integration of a company is only in one place ? the top , where strategy is made . Well-managed strategy is integrated in many places . The sales representative meeting the customer brings along everything a company represents . The operator assembling and testing a product puts together the physical representation of another mass of company detail . A product prototype brings together everything engineering can assimilate . Integration in strategic terms is not sufficient . Execution of the strategy needs to be integrated in detail . Integration takes place by keeping focused on an overall goal and by promoting policies that keep the detail meshed together . Since continuous improvement on a broad front can lead to discontinuous activity in many different areas , a stepwise progression through several primary goals is useful . All depends on the specific company case , but a typical goal progression is : 1 . Quality improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventive maintenance may be directed toward this in the beginning . Elegance in meeting other objectives is hindered until substantial progress is made in meeting this one . ( Prompt delivery of junk is a poor goal. ) 2 . Dependability . Doing what was promised when promised . Prompt delivery of top quality adds value . 3 . Cost reduction . Do it for less . Great strategy if you can already provide quality fast . 4 . Flexibility . Put some variety into it . Roll with the changes . Patterns of Thinking A popular business witticism is that impending bankruptcy , like a gun pointed to the head , concentrates the mind beautifully , but on what is left unstated . In an emergency , managers do not think much differently from the way they always have , only more quickly .  | Managers start emergency cuts with travel , training , or whatever else will not affect revenue in the short run . Seldom is there time for a thoroughgoing operations review because that , to be effective , has to be a part of the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzles together in simple ways . Cost models of business situations do not do this adequately . If the thinking pattern is primarily in terms of budgets and accounts , much of the importance of quality , timing , and flexibility is lost . If one thinks only in terms of customers and sales , much of the importance of operations costs , delays , and timing is lost . And if one thinks only of production , the importance of the customer is lost . The gist of many business school case studies is the mess created by this divergence of thinking . The emotions create an exciting script . The most common student solutions are to reestablish and affirm a consistent set of business goals . That the various protagonists will either subscribe to them or be fired is taken for granted . The necessity of much work at low levels , making sure everything dovetails , is seldom recognized . However , if one reads the accounts of companies deemed excellent , that is something they do well , and on which they expend a major fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One major problem of JIT implementation , in Japan as everywhere , is the reluctance of professional staff to be advisors and to work close to the action . Many have great difficulty comprehending that when it becomes personal . More prestige seems to accrue to working with an advanced project having a big budget than to assisting with the details of a series of simple improvement ideas . Attack staff work that tollgates the flow of production or the flow of information , especially customer orders . Promote staff work that breaks such jams . Tollgating stops a flow of traffic to collect a fee . Great tollgating empires have been created by eking an existence from the work of others ? until the source of traffic through the tollgate disappears . Much staff work seems to require stopping other peoples ' work to perform some check or add a specialized contribution . Production control stops material to count it . Accounting stops work to cost it . Quality control stops work to check it . And legalists must stop work to be sure procedures are observed and rights protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be performed without tollgating anything ? Could it be done more by coaching the action people ? Perhaps , but tollgating automatically defers to specialist dignity . Coaching must provide dignity , too . Staff work is not diminished in importance if tollgating functions come under close scrutiny , but functional specialists may not see it that way . Making the production worker responsible for quality eliminates quality inspectors . Having gauges and instruments close to the workers reduces business in special inspection departments . Such moves pop the bubble of big quality control organizations . Likewise , an inventory manager is apt to feel a certain unease if a declared objective is to eliminate stored inventory . The role of the quality staff shifts more to teacher and coach . If line workers are responsible for quality , they must know how to make measurements and how to avoid defects . The need for expertise from quality specialists is not diminished . It really increases . Some measurement problems at most manufacturing companies require special attention , thus all inspection can not be absorbed by the workers , and keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a problem . The role change is that the quality specialist has to work with the worker and work to promote production flow , not tollgate it . If the production worker needs coaching , then so does the sales representative , but perhaps not in the same way . Engineering and production may put a quality product into the field , but most customers perceive a company 's quality through the actions of sales and service representatives . Service quality done right the first time is the responsibility of those who do the work . By contrast , the need for manufacturing engineers to unplug work flow may call for greater staffing in that area . Companies like Omark Industries , who has made a good start improving manufacturing , all say that if starting over , they would strengthen manufacturing engineering more quickly . They are not gearing up for major automation but rather working through the myriad tool redesigns and machine alterations necessary to eliminate defects , reduce setup times , and change layouts . Omark strengthened manufacturing engineering by eliminating wasteful paperwork so that qualified people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real engineering that engineers like to do . New engineers were hired only at small plants that had none .  | However , manufacturing engineering is ineffective if engineering work can not be executed , and that requires capability in tool shops , maintenance shops , and other places where gadgetry is built . A plant that can not perform a large percentage of its own tooling and machine modification in-house is severely handicapped in continuous improvement . Trials of devices are slowed if they must be shipped in and out for revisions between times . Most important , skill development greatly depends on thoroughly understanding tooling and equipment in the context of their intended application . Few plants can be technically self-sufficient in everything , but their personnel should be expert in the heart of their own technology . Farming out key tooling work to save cost in the short run may increase cost in the long run . Scattering the technical knowhow among diverse tooling and equipment suppliers is strategically questionable . The work of manufacturing engineers consists of many small grit-and-grease projects that demand expertise beyond operators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off such projects while working on something that seems more important , like developing a simulation of the process if a terminal is handy . " Working with the worker " means giving priority to the details of improving the current process as well as future processes . This role change is difficult for some . In one plant , the work force enthusiastically endorsed the JIT/TQ process , but they revolted against the engineers ( in this case , quality and manufacturing engineers ) who would not help them overcome the problems they uncovered . They taunted them and hung derogatory signs . The workers ' action was unusual , but the situation was not . Engineers who will not work close to the action can not do the job . Methods improvement is another discipline in which coaching the work force is important . They need basic instruction in motion economy , layout , work methods description , time study , manmachine charting ? time-honored basics dating back to early in the century . Today , plants often have no one to coach these skills , or the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial engineering have skimped on this material in recent years , favoring more advanced technology and model building . Production managers have cut methods engineers during budget freezes on grounds that methods improvement is so elementary anyone could do it . They are right , but exposure to the  | basics in practice is still needed . Perhaps lack of association with the basics is why engineers concentrating on more advanced technology will program a robot to perform work that is either poorly designed or totally unnecessary . Reforming the staff work that less directly supports production requires digging deeply into the real reasons for it , some of which take no end of twists and turns . Customer orders are delayed to interpret whether any significant liabilities lurk within . Returns from customers are delayed so they can be counted in a future period 's warranty expense . Layout changes , in production and elsewhere and no matter how trivial , must be checked by a certified safety officer lest the insurance premium become extortionate . The source of these delays has been expedient responses to knotty predicaments , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thicket entails sorting through a labyrinth of complexity to separate the necessary from the waste . As a guide to thinking , go back to Chapter 2 and review the seven wastes . They apply just as much to nonproduction staff work as to the shop floor , and many situations are analogous to long setup times and so forth . PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT Performance measures historically used for production are seldom in accord with the objectives and concepts of continuous improvement . Performance measures reflect the values and expectations of those who desire the performance ? not always consistently , but their pattern of thinking is evident in them . Performance measures for production derive from performance measures used for an entire company , depending how managers think production relates to the whole . Historically , companies emphasized return on investment as a prime criterion of success , looking at it from an investor 's viewpoint , and frequently they emphasized growth of sales and assets . Beyond that , the measures emphasized market leadership , being a good corporate citizen , and similar factors lauded in corporate annual reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous improvement , the change in goals mostly reflects how it will earn more money ( or just survive ) over the long haul . The annual reports speak of quality , dependability , customer service , productivity , cost  | reduction , and , very noticeably , human relations . ( Omark issued its 1984 annual report with the names of all employees on it ? over 4,000 names . ) This change in corporate perception of what it is about is profound , but that will be addressed in Chapter 10 . While all companies must take in more than they spend , this changed outlook strongly affects the performance measures used for production , and the change process is another block-by-block construction job . Performance measures affect careers and promises made to people , so they are not changed without turmoil . Managers who have learned how to cope with a system they know well are thrust into a new arena at an advanced career stage . Changing everything at once is shock treatment . Purging the Old Begin by deemphasizing performance measures that distract managers from long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor efficiency measurements . Production managers driven hard by weekly reports of such measures tend not think far beyond them . Their compromises lean in the direction expressed by a supervisor in electronics assembly , who summarized his life thus : " Keep the line running , argue every case with QC , and keep ' em out of the john . " If efficiency measurements make managers nearsighted , incentive payment systems are near-blinding . Individual incentive systems make a shop into an every-worker-for-himself affair , which is disastrous if they must work as a team in flow-type production . Where people must work together , group incentives are used . Those are almost as bad . They still tilt all decisions toward the next paycheck . At worst , incentive systems penalize the worker 's pay for an improvement in production that is recognized as a change in method . Then , the standard for incentive purposes is tightened , so pay is effectively decreased . The workers ' incentive is to improve production by every means right up to the point where a new standard might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been attempted ( with partial success ) in incentive shops . Most managements believe they will find a way to reconcile the ideas . None succeed , and all sooner or  | later must go through a donnybrook with the work force if they wish to convert to a straight wage plan . The high earners are incensed by the pay cut ; low earners get an increase . The usual approach is to try converting to a straight-rate system with a small increase in average pay , thus as few people as possible take pay cuts . Incentive systems undermine efforts to cultivate a flexible work force . People are reluctant to move to jobs that pay less , and even if this can be administratively worked out , it is complicated . Incentive systems go along with narrow job descriptions , administrative burden , bidding rights on jobs , and informal pecking orders for " gravy positions . " Actually , many measurements used for production make a very bad assumption : the design and improvement of production is a staff concern , and line management and workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All performance measurements need to be examined to determine the extent to which this assumption pervades them and then changed according to the notion that staff , line management , and work force are all partners in constantly improving it . Costing It Out Budget and cost structures can also drive continuous improvement to destruction . A move that reduces waste can appear to increase cost and vice versa . A typical example : At John Deere 's Horicon Works , assembly operators had trouble keeping in stock the proper diameter hoses cut to the right length . Hose was purchased in coils , which were machine cut in lot quantities , boxed , and taken to assembly . The solution was to keep a coil of each hose diameter at assembly and to let assembly operators cut it to length with a knife . However , labor time for a machine cut was less than for a knife cut , so the cost appeared to increase . Buried in the overhead was the cost of several different containers , inventory investment , the indirect labor of 17 different " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus eight times moving it ) on its way through the plant , and the planning necessary to make it work . ( Deere made the change . ) Production cost structures often apply high overhead percentages to direct labor . A wily manager soon learns that an easy way  | to fake a cost reduction is by reclassifying direct labor work to indirect . Sharp cost accountants are well aware of such possibilities , and experienced auditors can recount a full repertoire of games that can be played with cost models imperfectly portraying reality . The best cost systems can not accurately portray the details of reality , but official sanction for production methods changes is to pass a cost savings test . A typical quandry is that throwing away defects seems to be less costly than any corrective action proposed . The cost system does not detail the delays and other wastes of defects . They are buried in the allowances and overhead . If a " petty cash " alteration obviously reduces waste but cost figures show nothing worth going for , make the change anyway . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough examination . A series of little improvements can add up to something that might not have been achieved by an expensive change in tooling and equipment anyway . In pursuing the source of quality problems , one finds that they may not be where they were thought to be . Likewise , the real sources of high cost may not be where the system assigns them . Allocate improvement money to line managers and judge results by whether costs aggregated by plant or by department trend downward . Aggregated costs pool together all the direct , indirect , overhead , and miscellaneous . If real progress is made , those should decrease . If not , line management leadership and judgment must be reviewed . Coming Clean Methodologies for devising many of these performance measurements are represented by books in a library of business . Changing any one of them would create ripples in a placid management pond . Revising the philosophy by which a company does business drains the pond completely . Companies find that all the methods and systems put in place over many years have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about people ? by which they no longer want to live . Go gack to where it is simple again and start over . For an old company , the stumbling block to manufacturing excellence is that a comfortable executive does not want to take on a complete purge of an old management culture . Such matters as  | setup time reduction and cell layouts are nonthreatening . Rebuilding the thought pattern of an old organization tests the mettle of the most ardent evangelical . Metering in the New The long list of performance measures in Table 6 ? 1 does not imply that performance measurement of continuous improvement must be complex . Excessive measuring is waste also , and the objective is to improve performance , not measure it to death . Some of the JIT/TQ pilot projects whose founders " just went into the shop and started " found after a few months that they were not documenting their achievement . An overcorrection gathers so much data that progress bogs down in its reporting . Most managements must fumble at first when developing reasonable goals and performance measures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures at once . They must be adapted to the context of the company and metered in as the organization is ready for them . A few measures should be used to set targets for improvement . Others are merely monitored and go along for the ride . The ones used for goal setting at the top of the organization should be few in number because too many different targets at once jumbles the pattern of thinking and sets people working at cross-purposes . Back in Chapter 3 the general manager of Figure 3 ? 4 set one primary quality goal : Reduce emergency field service calls by half in one year . That set off a flurry of work in field service , marketing , engineering , and production . Each was able to establish some subgoals , which should contribute to the overall one , then monitor their performance by it . The best production could do is be sure the product is 100 percent when it leaves the plant and to revise packing and shipping to better assure that the product arrives in the same condition . Production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product to death , but that is costly . Better to set major subgoals : Decrease failure rates at final functional test by half in six months , and decrease failure rates in burn-in ( reliability ) testing by half in six months . To accomplish those goals , production must work with design engineering as well as make improvements in its  | figure own processes ; thus the direction of engineering improvement and production improvement must be complementary . Unless the departments work together in detail , their improvement efforts will clash . No one knows whether these targets are reasonable , not even the manager who sets them . If they motivate , they are reasonable . The important goal is stimulating many parts of the organization to take actions that should all mesh together in the same direction .  | Each group achieving its target just by its own improvements is not sufficient . Engineering 's goal of 300 percent increase in meantime-before-failure might be achieved on newly released product through improved design alone . On its own , engineering may " harden " design entirely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is to work with production . For production submanagers to set contributing targets , they need to understand how their action assists the overall effort . The initial reason for setup time reduction , for instance , is to improve quality , and the improved material flow contributes to that ; but the idea is not to sacrifice quality just to attain setup time reduction . The increased setups per month are monitored but , for a time , they " just go along for the ride . " As improvement makes progress , general management 's primary target may shift to something like decreasing the throughput time of material while holding quality levels already attained . Then , the purpose of reducing of setup times would shift . The set of performance measures might remain nearly the same , but the emphasis on various ones would change . The purpose of performance measures is to make the company better ? always better . This reasoning underlies the construction of Table 6 ? 1 , which is a list of performance measures that may vary in emphasis from company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets and performance measures means nothing unless managers and workers understand how they relate to them ? and how the framework of production on which they are based goes together . Use of these measures by caretaker management accomplishes little . Since all the measures in Table 6 ? 1 are not self-evident , commentary is provided on selected ones . 1 . Quality trends . These do not go down and stay down . Even the best companies must reestablish quality after a change in products or an influx of new workers . The importance of trend is to monitor whether improvement is always taking place , given the recent situation . 2 . Work-in-process inventory . This is a major indicator of management status in a production facility , but its existence is not wholly due to factors within the facility 's control . WIP also can not  | always stay at minimal levels ; it increases due to new product , new workers , and similar situations . The trend should show that progress is always being made : If WIP goes up , it starts to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This measure responds very slowly to continuous improvement efforts because it takes time for people development , tooling development , improved maintenance , and so on to show results ( like waiting for the teenager to grow up ) . After two or three years , the trend should go downward if all other things remain equal ? which they probably will not . 4 . Linear production . Largely the subject of Chapter 7 , this refers to leveling and balancing the short-term load in production ? attaining an equal amount of production each day . ( In many plants , production moves at a snail 's pace , particularly in final assembly ? until month 's end , when it roars into overtime to make schedule and month-end billing times . The phenomenon is caused by large lot sizes and the entire approach of manufacturing management. ) 5 . Customer service . Production improvements that do not improve on this do not accomplish much . This too is greatly affected by both scheduling and the total approach to manufacturing management . 6 . Skill improvement of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in some way , the same number of people can accomplish more . If managers are to put major effort into development of those working for them , their performance in this regard should be measured . 7a . Total productivity . Productivity is improved by small gains ( such as reduction in rework ) . If productivity is measured , it should be overall productivity : figure Concentrating on direct labor productivity misses too much . Include all the indirect , staff , managers , and part-time window washers too . 7b . Morale . This intangible makes up for many deficiencies elsewhere , but it should be part of continuous improvement ? a big part . Outstanding performance on many other measures can not be attained without high morale . No matter how automated production is , nothing works unless the people involved want it to .  | 7c and d . Workplace organization and visibility . These are tangible but can only be rated , not given a direct number . These measures are two vital signs of morale as well as stimulators of other action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All major capital expenditures must be approved by management . The issue is capital for the small improvements that allow layout changes , setup time reduction , and driving defects to near zero . These activities are hamstrung if a committee has to approve every $500 appropriation . Allocate such capital to department managers , and expect them to use it wisely but stay in budget . 9 . Departmental expenses . Variance reports detailed by operation seldom suggest anything that could not be seen otherwise , and accounting systems applied too finely have many flaws . Nonetheless , no company can spend money it does not have , and controllers are charged with seeing that they do not . Keep the accounting for expenditures simple but strict . Expenses aggregated by department seems a logical low level for budget accountability ( not the same as detailed targets to reduce wastes ) . WORK FORCE PARTICIPATION IS MANAGEMENT PARTICIPATION Genuine work force participation with management largely comes from management participation with the work force . Regardless of the ugliness of past union-management relations , hope exists if a manager can talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their hands and why . Confidence , attitude , and trust make the difference . Selection Start with selection of people ? not workers first , but managers , staff , and supervisors . If a new plant is starting , those come first . If not , some form of evolutionary reselection process will be needed . Hopefully , some of the unfit will select themselves off the payroll . What to look for ? After resumes , predictive tests , and attestations of prior performance by former associates , the interviewing process starts to zero in on attitude . Attitude is crucial in two areas :  | willingness to be on the job and stay there and ability to work with other people . These attributes are hard to evaluate because they only show up over time . They do not show up on tests , and a good actor can cover them . Best advice is do not be in a hurry to hire and do maintain a long probationary period . Some fast-trackers with great ability may be lost that way , but the final team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining effort . Golden chain techniques are well-known methods to increase the chances that people will stay with a company , but nothing is certain in the United States . One can only provide a challenging environment in which people will want to work , and strive for the best retention average possible . The chances are improved by avoiding job-hoppers in a rush to hire . Even when selecting lead managers for JIT/TQ ( by whatever name ) , willingness to stay with the company is important . Other companies excited by the prospect of an experienced manager heading their own JIT/TQ will lure them , and consulting also offers the promise of comfortable money for travel experience . Many fledgling efforts have been crippled this way . One can ask key managers to sign longevity agreements as a signal of intent or whatever , but outright slavery is passe , so there is no keeping one who wants to leave . If other companies raid personnel , at least they recognize the company for doing something well . Less excusable are personnel transfers of lead people early in JIT/TQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and defects do not permanently implant the approach in the organization . Developing people takes a long time , so all personnel moves should have in mind the long-term development of everybody involved ( something like planning a church 's missionary program ) . Evaluating a manager or staff specialist for ability to work with people is also better done long-term than short . Managers and staff should have the ability ? and willingness ? to interact with anyone : top executives , workers , technicians , customers ? anyone . Good people skills coupled with technical talent are in short supply , so perhaps they can be developed if people with any inclination for it are hired in the first place , and if they understand why they need to work with people on the shop floor , in tool shops , or anywhere else .  | Abilities to communicate and to work with people are attributes executives mention most often when asked what is important in making a good manager at any level . JIT/TQ intensifies the importance of these managerial characteristics . As for workers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fills out an application . Workers should also have interest in working with other people . Equal employment laws in hiring and promoting do exist , but the criterion of communicating well can be clearly stated so it is not an unnecessary discriminator . Ask prospective employees to communicate some simple instructions to fellow interviewees , for example . Ask them to perform some task with a group , and look for clues to later behavior . If they will eventually be asked to describe and improve their work as part of the job , demonstration of an interest in doing that is not an unreasonable request . That job requirement should be documented for employment screening . Large manufacturers are experienced in such things . Small ones frequently make hiring errors . With no personnel specialist available , they quick-sort applicants when need for help is desperate ? if applicants can be found at all . That situation is the beginning of difficulties in developing people . Job Security The root of many problems is fear of unemployment . A company intending to increase productivity 20 to 30 to 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work force who believes that their reward will be an early place in the unemployment line . If costs drop quickly , perhaps the company could take market share from competitors and ship their unemployment to them , but that has not happened in the pioneer American cases . After major productivity improvements , companies still fight for life against tough competitors . Suspicion of management motives is the biggest reason employees , whether unionized or not , fear participating in workplace improvement . Narrow job descriptions are seen as a lifeboat that will see them to retirement ? without realizing that the lifeboat has a leak . Management and staff have the same fear as soon as they see that much improvement comes through reduction of their work .  | A policy on job security has to be presented in such a way that all employees have confidence in it . First , the company can try to obtain more work . A great motivator for a work force is to resume production of parts previously sourced out . Cost reductions may shift some make/buy decisions that way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improvement-minded , so a large volume of work may not boomerang back . Another approach is to aggressively seek contract production . Best is a hot new product , but a banker is not likely to bet on any of these at the time a policy on job security must be affirmed . Guarantee employment ? Not unconditionally . If company presidents can not guarantee their own jobs , they can not guarantee the jobs of others . Limited guarantees are feasible if finances are not desperate . The company will not dismiss an employee outright because of productivity improvement , but only if sales and profits decline ; thus people have more than enough time to find a new job . Formal policies mean less than attitude does . If a flinty treasurer rolls the notes on nervous bankers so employees can buy groceries , they understand that managers ( and owners ) intend to participate fully with them . In situations of less danger , it is a matter of reading intentions ? by all parties . Both managers and employees stop perfecting their attitudes somewhere short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful demonstration of real intentions from time to time makes the difference . Issues of job security can not be neatly solved . In multiplant companies , given substantial productivity improvement and flat sales , eventually a plant must close ? and perhaps more will follow . How closing is done is what counts ? " outplacement " rather than " good riddance . " That follows from attitude : the absence of any great distinction between the policies for staff , management , and " others , " and the recognition that operative workers skilled in improvement make the difference between an organization tuned to produce competitively and one that just runs . A company with that kind of work force and an aggressive approach to new product and markets has a better chance of avoiding a graceful plant closing , but first comes the demonstration of company intentions should matters come to a test .  | Sharing in the Improvement One of the first management thoughts is that to be properly motivated , the work force should have some form of gainsharing in the improvements . That depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival , not much . In a highly competitive situation , workers should not be deceived into thinking that productivity improvement is creating a fat pie from which they are entitled to a large piece . Competition forces nearly all the pie to go to the customers . For a time , better work environment and job security are sufficient reward for workers . Then , if there is something to share , they would like a part of it . Gainsharing plans come in all varieties , and most companies craft a plan that seems to suit them . Three different types of plans are best known : 1 . Scanlon Plan : based on estimating the value of productivity improvement through suggestions and group improvements , and covering a total organization . 2 . Rucker Plan ? : based on improvements in value-added , emphasizing involvement , and covering either all or part of an organization . 3 . Improshare ? : based on improvement in standard hours of output as measured by more traditional industrial engineering methods , the value of which is generally split 50/50 with shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable where labor-management relations are adversarial . Gainsharing at a minimum should help break worker resistance to productivity improvement . They no longer will be penalized in the paycheck for it . However , gainsharing is no substitute for making improvement a normal part of a worker 's job and for creating the environment in which this can flourish , and a hazard is worker expectations of a sustained high payout . The earliest American companies deeply into JIT/TQ have not instituted any special plan for gainsharing . Some have profit sharing . Suggestion systems with payouts also motivate with money . To be effective , they must be well managed , which entails creating an environment where good suggestions are developed and seriously  | evaluated . Much more than a clever payout plan is necessary , and again the root of problems is the method of management . Suggestions may point up oversights of supervisors or staff people , often unbeknown to the suggestor . They are often more involved to implement than the suggestor , whose perception of a total operation is limited , can understand . And economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cryptic code . Slow evaluation and a high turndown ratio discourage all but the imaginative few . Suggestions can be improved by training the work force to improve their workplace , by prompt evaluations and decisions , by recognition , and even by training them to do simple economic evaluations . Over the long haul , the payout for suggestions is best kept low if a large number of people will participate . A flat fee for any suggestion accepted is simple ? no fuzzy evaluation of payout delays anything , and no arguments ensue over who contributed how much to the suggestion versus how much to pay out . Employee participation in ownership is sometimes considered the ultimate motivation , but employees as a whole are not very entrepreneurial and much prefer sharing profits than sharing losses . Ownership is also no guarantee of agreement on management policy . In 1980 , " employee-owners " of South Bend Lathe Company , unhappy with wage negotiations , in effect struck against themselves . Underlying this action was unhappiness with their role in management under the ownership plan . Research on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees is not very clear . Short-term success can generally be demonstrated , but after the plan has had its effect , then what ? No plan is without difficulty . All exist in the context of management attitudes and methods of implementation . All are surrounded by a particular management 's approaches to improve manufacturing . All are subject to circumstances of change and competition in the markets in which a manufacturer competes . No " magic plan " can encompass all this . Some complexity comes from the assumption that a great gulf should exist between the role of management and the role of the worker , codified by dress and perpetuated by different reward methods and treatment for each . That gulf goes deeply into the culture . Song and script emphasize it .  | Think differently . Realistically , but differently . Accept that workers are to do more than make things : help make them with better quality , in shorter time , at lower cost . They are the technicians of a " production laboratory . " Management is still management , but of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone seriously believe that worker " cooperation " will match the docility of Japanese . That is not the point , and Japanese workers have not always been " docile " either . The point is to recognize that merely doing a job is not sufficient . Part of everyone 's job is constantly doing it better , using systematic means . How to start with workers ? By working with them on their work ; improving quality procedures , layout , standardization , workplace organization , and preventive maintenance at first ; finally , working into such matters as cycle time analysis . Work with them and " treat them right , " and eventually people will come around . Management attitude must accommodate to this . The reward structure follows . Development of skill is a premium requirement . Systems changes enable doing it better . No detail of management system or behavior is untouched . Some workers will thrive in this ; some will not do so well . Same for managers and staff . Workers will not run the company or be permitted irresponsible behavior . Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions within their domain to make . Participation Groups The most popular name for these is quality circles , but most companies have their own unique name selected for local appeal . These volunteer groups of 5 to 12 employees usually meet an hour or so a week on company time , but sometimes on their own time if they are enthusiastic . They may deal directly with problems concerning quality and productivity , or they might work on something indirect , such as how to control parking space . Each circle has a leader , and the rooms , times , materials , and paraphernalia are generally arranged by a facilitator . Sometimes these groups work well ; sometimes they fall flat , depending on the leadership of the facilitator and the management attention paid to them . Despite all the literature on how to operate  | them , many mistakes are made . The most common mistakes arise from grossly underestimating the degree of both management and worker preparation necessary . Many JIT/TQ plants in the United States do not have them or have failed with them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should exist between workers and supervisors in a JIT/ TQ plant . At Hewlett-Packard plants , for instance , supervisors hold a meeting with employees once per shift . These meetings are short recaps of what went wrong , and what went right , and how to do it better tomorrow , unless some special situation occurs . More apt names for special groups , properly used , might be contribution groups or improvement groups . Time , patience , and training are necessary before these groups can be expected to make sustained contributions . Both the managers and the workers must learn how to work in this way . Many workers are not interested in participating . Volunteers from 25 percent or so of the total plant work force seems a good average . As in any activity , a minority of the workers will make a great difference if they are well directed , but they take time developing themselves for it . Participation groups are good training forums as well as sources of improvement methods . Start with experienced workers . They need to understand the company and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality and methods improvement is desirable . Even then , groups at first tend to work on trivia that annoy them : noise levels , location of drinking fountains , color of trashcans . These problems are important to them , so pay heed . The management task is to eventually steer the group in productive directions . A popular thought is that participation groups should work on whatever they choose . That leads to trouble . If they want to change the entire plant layout or revise the quality system , they will run afoul of management and staff who deal with such matters . At first , the facilitator and group leaders can direct things with questions concentrating attention close to their own work : " Describe your own job , or part of it , using an element listing much as an industrial engineer would . What are the problems you see ? " " Describe a problem you touch every day with your own hands . " Small-scale problems close to the work are likely to be solvable without being turned into Big Projects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale .  | A participation group should have management permission to work on a large-scale problem . The agreement is that management will not tackle the problem while the group takes a reasonable amount of time to chew on it . If they propose something , management must review it . If they give up , management goes at it again , and the group moves on to something else . All but the simplest participation group recommendations generally require some allocation of resources to be put into effect . That constitutes a management review and decision . A common problem is to underestimate the amount and level of management time consumed by this task when many groups are in action . If the groups have not been " brought along " effectively , the time consumed and the reject rate spell a demise for participation groups . Everyone is demoralized . For that reason , good policy is to not start too much activity at once . Work into it slowly and do it well . Better to have a waiting list of volunteers for involvement groups than to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A considerable start can be made on JIT/TQ without participation groups ; and , by contrast , great benefit can come from participation groups without doing much toward JIT/TQ . However , workplace organization and visibility practices are great stimulators of employee involvement in many ways . The progress rate is limited by the rate the improvement effort can be handled and by the need to keep it all in control , coordinated with management and staff work , using participation group contributions . Everyone has to feel their way into this new role . It is not done in a year or so ? but rather much longer .

As usual , engineering is straining to move on out the curves in scope and speed , while marketing chafes to show what they have already . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're pushing them before they have stabilized their yield , but Bill Jeffries , their main brain out there , assures me they will stuff it in the sock soon . " " In October , we will close out domestic production of UF32 . At $20,000 it is still good for a piece of the action , but Hitachi is dealing for $17,000 to $18,000 now , so we have to make a move because we will not drop below zero margin . Despite our progress in manufacturing , we are not hanging with their learning curve . We can chop almost $2,000 just by doing a full buy in the Far East , and the labor tab in Taiwan knocks off another $400 . We 'll have to station a couple of test engineers over there a while to respec output with the new components , but we are expecting a fast start-up . The move should keep us within haggling range of Big H anyway , and with the VX coming strong , any layoff should be temporary . " " Incidentally , I bumped into Fujimoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business , and he said , Not so good . Sales below target , costs above target , and new product behind schedule . Just surviving . ' Inscrutable as ever . " footnote exhibited , and perhaps it will clarify the primary moral : Manufacturing excellence is attained only in part by technical breakthrough and management technique . The major portion is learning to live it throughout an entire company .  | " UF32 has been a great training ground for SQC , process simulation , involvement meetings , MicroCost , robotics , and JIT . In 1985 , we cut defects by a third , trimmed 11 percent from direct labor , reduced inventory 21 percent , and paid out $41,000 in suggestions . One supplier even delivers daily . " " We think a lot of this can transfer into the VX production , and we are starting some moves there . In addition , the VXs are the first product line fully designed using CAD/CAM and Autotest . " Gary buzzed through the remaining divisional highlights in 10 minutes , concluding with efficiencies , utilizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost matrix . Abruptly , he brandished a control wand and flicked the room to full darkness . On the screen , a multispectrum strobe lighting sequence touched off an ingenious 14-minute marketing tape , which combined graphics created by VX1000 with equipment displays and explanations , systematically punctuated by the driving sound of the Ragged Edge , a talented soft-rock group . When he relighted the room , Gary could see that this touch of show business had had the intended mesmeric effect on the gnomes of Rock Candy Mountain , the term universally used by divisionals referring to folk from Megatech corporate headquarters . The gnomes recovered quickly , tossing accolades on Gary 's performance with the division , and Gary instantly sensed that a few feelers for headquarters citizenship might be in his future . Then they took their turn . Chuck Zorn , Vice President , Electronics Group . Squint eyes marking years pursuing his favorite avocation of flying , blazer and oversize collar betraying an engineer uncomfortable in ties , Zorn praised the status of MUFTD and each of the five divisional staffers present , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become better ; and for that , I think we have to promote symbiotic excellence between all divisions in Electronics Group . We have increased the transfers of R &D; engineers between divisions . Next we can exchange the best training personnel among us for each of these management programs ; and best , this year for the first time we will hold each division 's annual marketing meeting simultaneously to catch the spillover effect from the scribbles on the napkins in the evening . We must do a better job matching our technology with the vast applications opportunities out there . "  | Kyle Morgan , Corporate Director of Purchasing . " We have fewer serious delivery problems with items negotiated through our worldwide sourcing program . Quality problems occasionally , but not delivery . Corporate leverage helps with more than just price . The 256K is one of the items that only MUFTD uses , so it is not in the worldwide purchasing base . But if that item , or any other serious-trouble item were transferred to it , we might help ? perhaps not this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Linda Stiles , Corporate Director of Quality . " The Megatech Training College is now staffed up for 12 modules in total quality control . I know MUFTD is well established in the SQC ones , but there are seven more , and we can certainly provide a good trainthe-trainer package on each for all divisions now , so pick some people to send as soon as you can . Also , we have nearly finished the third one in the series for engineers . It 's called , Parametric Design by Analysis of Variance . ' It can be integrated into CAD/ CAM , and it will stop many quality oversights before they are ever begun . " Alberto Corelli , Electronics Group Controller . " I dislike always being the dash of cold water at these parties , but Megatech has a problem . The financial analysts seem to have gotten on a kick of comparing the asset utilization of high-tech companies ? who knows why . They pick on our asset ratios , and they like to sift through the 10K reports for evidence of exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , material handling , automation ? that sort of thing . So we 're doing some work to come up with guidelines for potentially resorting the asset base at each division . You can expect something on this to hit within the quarter because the analysts got on Heilweil 's case at their last meeting . " ( Alexis Heilweil was the personification of the tall-tantrim CEO , who zipped through each Megatech facility at least once per year to keep in touch . ) Clark Gruenther , Corporate Director of Computer-Integrated Manufacturing . " I 'm sure all of you have been hearing about integrated manufacturing database management . We have n't been making noise , but something like this can not be done in a quiet little corner . "  | With that , Gruenther began unfolding the layers of this newest in corporate management methodologies . It consisted of two major parts , ( 1 ) computer-integrated process planning and ( 2 ) computerintegrated process control . Everything keyed off computer-aided design , and trickling out from that was computer-generated bills of material , integrated material requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optional process data collection for labor , material tooling , and quality . The quality system took off from Autotest and would keep quality and yield data sorted in various categories ? yields and defect causes in database . The whole thing was tied together by a common data transfer language , and the idea was to whip the problem of systems that can not talk to each other . Gruenther rolled through this overview in an hour , pausing only twice to recount favorite war stories from his manufacturing days . Gary Crowe had the MUFTD library update the electronic mail with the snippets of new developments , but he had to admit that some of the concepts loaded in this bomb were new to him , and the fuse was armed for THE DISCUSSION , which followed as the gnomes began working their pre-agenda . Zorn said nothing as Gruenther and two cohorts zeroed in , beginning by extolling the past glories of MUFTD . " You were the first with MRP , closing the loop before anyone . You 're the only one with automatic forecast updating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is old hat here ; guided vehicles no trick . If any place can do it , you can . We will apply the full power of corporate systems to developing integrated manufacturing database management for this division , and when it has been proven , Megatech will have a package to market that will bring manufacturing right into world-class 21st century status anywhere . You need not say anything now . Just think about it . We 'll provide an on-line demo anytime you want . " Meanwhile , Back at the Ranch . One floor below , George Saunders sat just below the Quality-Is-Number-One banner , relaxing his grip on the telephone . " How many will they loan us ? Five hundred for a week ? . . . Good deal , Charley . I 'll pick ' em up myself at Delta Baggage in the morning . . . You 'll get them ? . . . OK . I 'll make sure the records stay straight , and everything . Buy you  | a beer if they 're on the line before eight ; two if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George put down the phone , elated as a production manager ever becomes , and called over his evening supervisor for printed circuitboard subassembly . " Doris , skip the 64K RAMs at insertion on the VX Buff Board , load everything else , and stack them until morning . " He and Charley Foss in purchasing had just saved two days ' production on a subassembly line , their second such save of the month . The situation : Welco was late shipping 64K RAM memory chips for two reasons . First MUFTD had stepped up production without that fact working its way through the materials planning system that pumped schedule requirements to the Welco plant . There was a slight planning delay in MUFTD 's system , and a bigger one in incorporating the notice of it into Welco 's planning system . Second , MUFTD had experienced an increase in boards that had to be scrapped . Experienced operators worked the boards using the 256K bubbles , and both Welco and MUFTD watched that one , each keeping a week or two of buffer stock in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators on the lesser skill boards , and the first few weeks , 30 percent of them were ruined beyond repair , so the consumption of 64K RAMs shot up , some of it going into the can . Unfortunately , Welco had chosen this same time to start up some new equipment on their old 64K RAM process , and their yield had been erratic during the same time . One shipment rushed from Welco had an 18 percent dropout rate at MUFTD on the RAMs themselves , a mountainous spike compared to their recent history on that item . Welco shipped 64K RAMs according to a weekly shipping release sent by MUFTD , but this week 's shipment had not yet arrived due to Welco 's internal yield shortfall ; and although George had transferred an experienced operator back to the line to stem the excess waste of boards , by Wednesday morning he could see they would not make it through the evening shift without the reservoir of 64K RAMs running dry . George phoned Charley Foss with a red alert . Charley 's prime time was mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More important , he had just transferred from a sister plant in Orlando a year ago and had connections there , and  | that plant happened to also use the 64K RAM . Charley first telephoned Welco , who assured him they were cooking a new batch and yield looked great so far , nothing but superior specimens in the mid-week production dedicated to Megatech . On Friday , they would ship a double order to Charley plus meet their regular coverage at Orlando . With that knowledge , Charley persuaded a buddy at Orlando to loan a week 's supply of 64K RAMs , shipped by Delta Airline overnight , with repayment the next week by the same means ( Charley picking up the freight cost , naturally ) . With the 64K RAM loan inbound , George would lose only the ability to completely finish the Wednesday evening shift production ; otherwise , he was dead for the rest of the week on the five-person line assembling the VX Buff Board . He had to transfer operators , and he risked shutting down final assembly due to a shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degreeof-difficulty range in his department ? a real black mark . Just as bad , he would finish the week with a wounded earned hours report ? a mark that might not be totally black but certainly considered brown and soft , and it was already muckle-dun from new boards , engineering changes , and green operators . The earned hours report was Megatech 's version of the production efficiency report . Calculation of the measure was based on earning a fixed number of labor-hours for each good board sent to assembly , with hours deducted for boards returned from assembly as unusable . That was earned hours , and a simple version of the measure was a ratio of earned hours for the week divided by total direct labor-hours compiled on the time clock ( which , in Megatech 's case , was really a log-in computer terminal ) . This report was the heavyweight item in George Saunders ' management report card . Joe Burke , his manufacturing manager , said something about it almost every week . But George never knew whether Joe was half-serious or full-serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling in ! You must be discharging capacitors in their seats . " " Things seem off a tad . Too many breaks for birthday parties this week ? " So far as George knew , every pin-striper scrutinized the minutiae in those weekly reports right on up to Rock Candy Mountain and Heilweil himself . In his 14 years of supervision , George had accumulated comprehensive savvy on every factor affecting earned hours ratios . Other production managers sometimes called him " The Fox . " Five  | years ago , he had deftly planted in a plant manager 's brain the idea of adjusting the earned hours upward for time spent on rework , using the justification that such an adjustment made for a more accurate standard . The adjustment factor was based on the best three out of the past six months in percentage of departmental labor spent on rework . With three successive engineering managers , he had successfully negotiated the following policy on rework . George always phoned engineering if a quality problem could not be resolved within 15 minutes . If the problem appeared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown at shift 's end , it was automatically classified as an engineering problem so the rework hours spent did not count in the earned hours ratio . A year ago , George had argued for a material shortage adjustment , so that if a supplier did not deliver or if material was declared unusable , the hours lost could be charged to an exception and dropped from the ratio calculations . After a churn through two committees , a compromise was reached . George and other production managers could drop only half the hours lost , on the theory that partial responsibility kept production alert to part quality and to potential shortages instead of just waiting to be served . MicroCost could easily handle mega-category variances . The shortfall in 64K RAMs was only one of the problems of the week for George Saunders ? he had a new component sequencer to deal with . Installed the previous week , the equipment representatives had stayed for two days coaching the operators , and everything seemed to be working . But on Tuesday , the operators experienced component feeding problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that morning he had spent two hours embroiled in a discussion with them and maintenance on the methods of programming the machine and making adjustments in feed . Meantime , George was employing the old sequencers as backup and trying to keep untangled who was running what . George 's inserters were also overloaded , and on Monday he had brought back two old ones to use as backup on the overload . But this had cramped the space available , and the operators who really knew how to run them were no longer in the department . The recent increase in schedule had also fouled the flow of material from his department through wave solder , an area used  | jointly by three departments . Until this week , George had been able to clear VX500 boards through wave solder in the first three hours of the day shift , but now this was interfering with boards coming in from the other departments . When his soldered boards arrived later in the day at inspection , test and inspection people were left waiting for work at midday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish out . A test engineer was still working with a new functional test module developed from Autotest . For some reason , it did not perform the same way as several tests already programmed ? something to do with changing the programming to increase the speed of functional test . Meanwhile , no one was quite sure whether several boards met the functional test specification ? another delay , and another stack of material . Now that the 3 ? 11 shift had settled in and the crises were reduced to simmering , George had time to review the situation and prepare for the morrow . It was all a pretty normal set of problems , he thought to himself . He had managed to get atop this week 's schedule increase by starting a build-up the previous week , stuffing a little padding in the department 's stocks , and , as it turned out , he had had to use them . Baring any more unforeseen glitches like the 64K RAMs , he should be through the week with his reputation unsullied and his earned hours intact ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially higher future at Megatech , despite having finished only a B.S. in an undistinguished evening program at Brevard Tech . As he was preparing to scroll through the electronic mail and rifle his in-basket , the telephone rang . The voice sounded familiar . " Is Mac Dalrymple in ? " " No , " George replied . " You 're looking for customer service , but you have George Saunders in production . Do you work here ? " " Not now , but I did . This is Tom Simms . I 've been in sales engineering for three years now , and I have a honey of a deal working if only we can make a few changes in that VX500 . Twilly Productions could use it . " " Twilly ? " George queried . " I did n't know we sold to them . You hardly ever keep track of who the customers are down here . " " We do n't , but we could , " replied Simms . " All we need is just a little more oomph in capacity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you wait and sell them a VX1000 ? I understand that is in the works for nine months down the line . Hell , we 're just patching together the VX500s now , but I guess it is not mine to decide such things . " " It 's a timing problem , " said Simms . " Twilly is scouring the universe for something to use for a new production , and if we ca n't hit them right away , they may not wait , and my foot will be in my mouth instead of in their door . Sorry for the wrong number . I 'll dial again . Got ta get on it . Bye . " George resumed sifting the stack from his in-basket , on one side of which was taped a sign saying , " MUFTD is a just-in-time organization , " while the other side displayed a yellowed you-wantit-when cartoon . There was a memo initialed by 10 executives , authorizing addition of 15 VX500s to next week 's schedule because marketing needed them for demonstrations . George digested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the seminar invitations for everything from project management methods to telephone procedures . A little more slowly , he shuffled through the remaining papers : Notification of an involvement group leaders and facilitators meeting . A plea to find an hourly employee to contribute to the divisional newsletter . A reminder to coordinate preventive maintenance time on all green tag equipment ( motors and moving parts , but nonprogrammable ) . Next was a memo rejecting Lena Turley 's latest suggestion . Lena worked manual insertion on the main VX500 printed circuitboard , and she also sheparded the boards through wave solder . George reread her suggestion : " Immediately after manual insertion , mount the VX500 boards in the same carrier frame used at wave solder . Stack them on a cart and move them to wave solder and feed the boards directly in . That will save time finding the correct carrier frames at wave solder and it will save double-handling . " Signed : Lena Turley . The response was two pages of estimates and calculations , which boiled down to rejecting the suggestion because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear , but they would cost $8,500 ? hefty , but shop labor for such things was not cheap , and two new carts would be necessary at $800 per . The time saved at projected volumes would amount to only $14.21 per day to eliminate double-handling , which was a three-year payback , much longer than the two years allowable for such things .  | No mention of the time finding the carrier frames and the quality possibilities . The memo thanked Lena for her contribution and urged her not to be discouraged , but to try again . It was signed by one Loren Crowder in manufacturing engineering . For a moment , George considered telephoning Mr. Crowder to ask him to explain his response to Lena himself , but with a wellpracticed profanity , he slapped the memo in his To-Do folder and began to ponder the metaphysics buried in the latest quarterly plant capacity report . A short assembly line had been torn out , so capacity had dropped ; but VX500 was still not up to speed on the lines converted for it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 65 percent figure considered minimally acceptable by both divisional management and Rock Candy Mountain . Their guidelines were to tear out capacity if overall utilization dropped below 65 percent , and add capacity if utilization broke through 85 percent . By experience in using Megatech measures , if utilization rose above 85 percent , deliveries began to slip . George had lived through three 85 percent periods at MUFTD . All three times had been travails of burgeoning backlogs , quality quick-fixes , priorityswitching , and crash-mode expediting , all accompanied by anguished wails from marketing . Several times George had asked why 85 percent was not shifted in scale to become 100 percent , but no one had ever answered his question . Finally , at the bottom ? to George 's disbelief ? he found a poster sent by someone in the quality directorate at Rock Candy Mountain , which he was seriously asked to display . It advised one and all that September 8 was the 15th anniversary of the Megatech Zero Defects Program .  | Synchronizing the Company Timing is very important in operations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quality and productivity in production and in other operations as well , including those in marketing and engineering that feed into production . In fact , organizing a smooth flow of work there is necessary if a smooth flow is to be obtained in production . Scheduling and improvement go together . The objective is not to make some magic form of scheduling work , but to schedule so as to capture maximum possible advantage of regular cycles to improve every aspect of operations . This begins with the basic approach to the business . A passage from a long-ago paperback , title now forgotten , suggests the opposite condition : " Harbaugh 's advertisement read , Will do anything legal . Any time . Any place . Fee negotiated . ' Not surprisingly he was a little disorganized . " Organizing in this sense is " nonrandomizing " the part of the world one wishes to work with . It is done all the time without much thinking of it , as when developing a set of qualified leads for marketing enticement , separating the susceptible from the random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimated , as is the power of dispelling randomness so that wasteful work is much reduced . Considerable quantitative modeling deals with the effects of random events . A classic but simple model representing a single truck dock is shown in Table 7-1 . It assumes that trucks arrive at an average ( or mean ) rate , but the actual timing follows a random distribution ( Poisson ) . Load/unload times on the dock average half an hour but are also randomly distributed . ( Such models have been  | figure shown to reasonably represent the real thing so long as everyone is just reacting to what happens . ) The percent idle time on the dock surprises no one , but the waiting time of trucks builds up more than is typically imagined . If trucks arrive as fast as they can be unloaded , the line backs up to infinity ( were there trucks and space enough ) because any small delay in unloading creates a backlog that can never be caught up . At the extreme , this model turns into silliness . A management confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks , or it can increase the load/unload rate on the dock , but the most interesting action it can take is to dispel the randomness in the situation . Suppose trucks arrived at a constant half-hour interval , and each one was unloaded in exactly half an hour , as if the dock operated as a station on a conveyor line . This is the idea behind synchronizing activities , not just in production and transportation but anywhere possible in the company . Far too much energy goes into work that just reacts to randomness , and too little into filtering it out , both in management practice and in academic modeling of management problems . Synchronizing operations is much more than just aligning a pattern of numbers in a schedule . It attempts to remove as much variance as possible from the process of serving the customer , beginning with the planning of sales and ending with delivery to the customer . Many management innovations come from thinking this way .  | Benihana of Tokyo organizes restaurant patrons into a regular pattern for service . Reservations attempt to space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in if they can be accommodated . Some reservations arrive late , and some wait for others to join their group , so despite the attempt to level-load , arrivals must be held and marshalled in groups of eight in a small waiting lounge . Irritation by the delay is usually assuaged by one or more high-markup drinks . Each group of eight is led to a hibachi table , where they are treated to a show-biz performance by a chef ? elapsed time , about 40 minutes . By the 50-minute mark , a barren table suggests the show is over , and the group leaves , most never detecting that they have been very politely marched through a one-hour episode of a repeating show so captivating that it is much imitated . Their method makes maximum use of chefs , tables , space , and time ? not to mention bartenders . Benihana of Tokyo does more than just organize the kitchen , isolating it from customers . It organized the business for its synchronized approach to service , refining all the details until they fit its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in a manufacturing company . SYNCHRONIZATION AND UNIFORM LOAD SCHEDULES Synchronization is matching repeating cycles of activity . Cycle lengths may differ ; but , if all are multiples of one another , they start and stop together , forming a harmonic pattern of work . The definition is as simple and as abstract as the definition of time itself : hourly , daily , and weekly cycles all fitting within each other . Production cycles may be as short as fractions of seconds per unit ( as in chunking out beer cans ) or as long as weeks and months ( building jumbo jets ) . Business activity cycles may also be long or short ? days , weeks . . . years ? but are tied to some repeating cycle . Business time cycles are so fundamental that , once adopted for a given organization , they tend not to be further questioned . Regular timing dispels " randomness " from the void of the universe . It does so in a physical sense , and it does so in a business sense . If any human activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly described as " running like clockwork. "  | Balancing Production Flows and the Cycle Time Concept Do as much work as possible so that its time cycles mesh with those of the total activity of which it is a part . At its most abstract , that is the cycle time concept introduced in Chapter 4 , but there are several aspects to it : 1 . Duration of work is one type of work cycle ? time between setups or time between tool changes . Duration should be limited by the number of work cycles until a process capability begins to fade from control . Setups , tooling , lot sizing , and quality checking all may be based on a natural quality cycle . Several processes linked together may key on the quality cycle of the dominant process ( Chapter 3 ) . On the other hand , any operation may go through numerous setups having the purpose only of transmitting a uniform load of material requirements to the next lower operations ? as is true of assembly operations . 2 . Work studied by the cycle time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . With reduced variance in both work cycle times and duration ( setup ) cycles , operations can be more closely balanced in operating rate . Fitting the support activity into a pattern of work starts to become feasible ( Chapter 4 ) . 3 . There are two major cases in balancing running rates : a . Variable work cycle operations ( usually manual ) : The desire is to increase production rate by adding people and to decrease it by subtracting people . Doing this has two requirements : 1 . Flexible , multifunctional workers . 2 . Layouts for flow and flexibility . Allow workers to easily move from station to station and permit them to adjust elements of work content from station to station . This is very important in assembly areas and is desired in fabrication as well . ( The simple cell lends itself to this , and it is an outstanding feature of a welldeveloped U-line . Refer to Figure 5 ? 1. ) b . Fixed work cycle operations ( usually machines ) : Induction heat treating is an example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality parts . For this kind of operation , have the machine idle between work cycles , as illustrated in Table 5 ? 1 and Figure 5 ? 2.  | Attaining major improvements in quality , layout , work force flexibility , visibility , and all the rest make uniform load scheduling easy . Without improving the process itself , no scheduling method can duplicate the overall effect . Balancing cycle times is simple organizationally . Each suborganization studies what it needs to do to mesh its work cycles with the cycle times of part use that the overall schedule demands . Whatever it can do , it does , depending on the degree of its attainments so far . However , people must be well oriented to quality , timing , and improvement to do it , and constantly thinking this way is a mindwrench at first . If production can be organized repetitively , cycle time thinking can be greatly refined ; but if the product line does not lend itself to repetitive processes , what then ? Consider the job shop one big " variable work cycle operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout are as flexible as the nature of the work will permit , scheduling and planning are easier . Establish as many visibility methods of shop control as possible , and make use of repeating time cycles in any way possible , however limited . The Uniform Schedule In the repetitive case , an overall pattern of work is set by a final assembly schedule . Having the use rate of all materials throughout a specific production period is the easiest possible pattern of work for each supplying operation to match ? perhaps not perfectly , but as close as possible . Thus the short definition of a uniform or level schedule is , " Make a little bit of everything every day . " Setting up a production schedule for uniform usage over a specific period of time entails more than a technique for final assembly scheduling . Activities that feed production must mesh with it : Marketing Sales planning or demand management . Order entry and customer promising . Logistics . Field Service . Engineering Design of product . Timing of changes .  | Production process Design and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Processes of suppliers . Scheduling Based as much as possible on simple linkage of synchronized activity , and as little as possible on managing inventory that separates uncoordinated activity . For the assembled product , material usage at final assembly draws material into it if a " pull system " of control is used , so scheduling is a preplanning of volumes and sequences in final assembly during a production period . Scheduling must also advise the supplying operations of the approximate volumes and sequencing so that they can plan to mesh with final assembly . The actual performance may deviate a little from this game plan . The intention is to prepare for as much synchronization as can be mustered . An Example : 3M Magnetic Media Division , Hutchinson , Minnesota . The 3M Magnetic Media plant makes magnetic recording tape for home video recorders and for commercial use . Much of the production consists of half-inch VHS video tape made to order in a tough , competitive market . There are about 100 different enditem variations of this product , not counting the different labels applied for different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Variations are in the configuration : different cases , cartridges , tape lengths , speeds , and so on . All are made from the same material from a coating process , which is the technical heart of the plant . However , delivery problems came from the downstream operations that slit the tape and converted it to a final form for the customer . In 1982 , 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson shipped only 40 to 50 percent on time in any week . Poor delivery of a cost-competitive " commodity " product was unacceptable if 3M wished to stay in the market . For about two years , it went through the soul-searching process , finally deciding that it had to go to JIT/TQ to survive . In late 1983 , it began holding meetings of managers . The meetings gradually began to include more and more people . One of the critical items was how to rethink the scheduling process . That , they  | soon discovered , required rethinking the production process and the marketing order entry process . Product engineering changes were not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks in length was decided upon , somewhat arbitrarily . Management believed it could get through 20 to 30 different varieties during two weeks if setup times were reduced ; and , if so , it should be able to produce a mix close to that demanded by customers for two weeks . Marketing was apprehensive but agreed to " freeze " schedule for two weeks . Very few genuine emergency requests from customers could not wait two weeks . Many expedite requests were caused by customer panic through late shipment . Not every variation of half-inch VHS tape was produced every two weeks . High-volume repeaters were in every schedule along with a mix of " occasional oddballs . " Substantial revision of every detail of the production process was necessary to run by such a schedule . Production would operate by the packing process , " pulling " material in from the feeding operations ? a simple form of " Kanban square " system , which they had to work out for themselves using their own order sizes , cart sizes , and cassette sizes . The details could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using styrofoam cups on brown paper layout models of the operation . All supervisors and key production personnel were involved , though not all at one time . As a result , they decided to run by a daily schedule those items of sufficient volume that one pallet-load or more could be packed per day . Lower-volume items were run as complete orders . Finished packing was shipped to a customer as soon as enough was accumulated for economical shipping ? or a customer order was complete . Layouts changed . Quality delays were addressed . Equipment and tooling modified . Locations and containers specified for the workings of a " pull system . " About five months after the first Saturday simulation , the new scheduling system turned on . The agreement with marketing was that anything in the two-week schedule was as good as shipped , and do not promise a customer delivery that forces breaking into schedule unless they have a real problem . Priorities in the subsequent two-week schedule are at the customer 's service .  | In the first two-week period , 3M Magnetic Media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both overshipment and undershipment are deviations from schedule . ) For the following year , it was 98.5 percent to schedule , and the major cause for late shipment was unavailability of the customer 's label . ( The company is working on that . ) Marketing 's fears subsided slowly . They prevailed to break into the schedules only about once a month to provide something special . Service improved , but marketing wanted better . Work-in-process inventory decreased , and finished goods remained low . ( Previously , shipping quantities were cumulated also . ) The personnel and the work previously required for detailed scheduling and control of the conversion shop floor disappeared . The internal materials planning system simplified , though it must still provide for . long lead time materials from suppliers . After a year or so , the schedule period was shortened from two weeks to one . Then 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson could within a week regularly deliver small orders and begin delivery of large ones , but this response time was still considered too long . Marketing wanted same-day service for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than stock all the variations of tape cassettes , production believes it has become flexible enough to provide the equivalent of off-the-shelf service . Now extra time is provided in each daily schedule to run small orders for same-day shipment . With experience , small differences in cycle times at each operation for each daily mix can be overcome through worker and equipment flexibility . Development of a Uniform Load Assembly Schedule The development of a uniform load schedule for a situation somewhat like the 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson plant is shown in Table 7-2 . The numbers are simplified for easier reading , and the schedule period is a month rather than two weeks . For more complex products running at slower rates , the uniform consumption of parts demands mixed model assembly ; that is , instead of completing production in container sizes of 100 , as in Table 7-2 , it is completed in lots of 1 . An example familiar to many is automotive assembly . Vehicles of the same exact type do not follow each other down the line .  | Each unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix on one line is considerable : two-door , four-door , sedan , station wagon ? even different nameplates . That mix is common . Less common , but still practiced , are mixes of two-wheel and four-wheel drive , cars and pickup trucks , and different frame sizes . In addition to the mix of basic models , automotive assembly complicates the sequencing problems with mixes of different options : engine types , air conditioning , trim packages , and the like . Handling this taxes flexibility of line layout , assembly equipment , parts sequencing to assembly , and the flexibility of the work force . If the assembly process is designed so work can easily shift between stations , the problem is much simplified . ( The objective is not a complex line-balancing algorithm , but to remove as many balancing constraints as possible with little or no cost . Work content balancing through mobility is not presently helped much by robots because they can not move from station to station as easily as people do . ) Similar situations exist with large appliances and large mainframe computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options ) . Two of the toughest situations are aircraft and large trucks . Given that , a simple explanation of mixed model assembly presents only the essence of the problem . Instead of bunching models of highly similar type for assembly , build them mixed-model ( as shown in the example below ) for a proportional mix of four As , three two Cs , and 1 D , repeated throughout a production period : A ? B ? C ? A ? B ? A ? B ? C ? A ? D This sequence can be arranged several different ways and still come out with the desired result , spreading the consumption of parts for each model evenly throughout the production period . A mix as simple as this is a back-of-an-envelope calculation , even when volumes for each model do not come out in simple proportions . If operations are being developed for balancing by the cycle time concept , scheduling becomes easier . If not , no scheduling magic will make waste-reducing physical changes . However , at best , options and suboptions associated with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintaining a uniform load of the major model components is usually inimical to good spacing of low-use options . Operations producing high-percentage-of-use components see a uniform loading , but those producing the rarely used options see a schedule of " random droppings , " the opposite of the effect intended .  | If products have not been designed for production , attaining this kind of schedule ( and production process ) is hopelessly complicated . If options have been designed for interchangeability and layered build-up , an elaborate mix of product for the customer can be handled this way . It depends on whether the company has created " nonrandom order " out of the chaos in its marketplace . For engineering to design products for a highly meshed production process , it must have that type of process in mind all along . In addition , willy-nilly scattering of engineering changes into a uniform schedule rapidly makes it nonuniform , so engineering changes should be grouped to avoid being random ripples cascading through a process . In a plant like 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson , this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optioned production , it is . The production process is one major reason nonuniform patterns of parts consumption exist even if a schedule for it has been created . If assembly does not proceed at a steady rate , the pattern is lost . If units must be taken out of sequence in assembly for quality reasons , the pattern is lost . If a supplying process can not deliver quality material on time , the pattern is lost . A revamp of the schedule disrupts the mix of material demanded for every other process supplying the same assembly . Synchronization has different degrees , and therefore the degree of precision required in developing and holding a uniform or mixed model schedule differs . If processes feeding assembly do so only in daily quantities , then the mix sequence during the day means nothing in further providing a pattern of work to the feeding processes unless they are being developed for closer than daily synchronization . If an auto company has special seats for each automobile fabricated and sent to assembly in vehicle sequence , then seat fabrication and auto assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing ? In that instance , seats are bulky and subject to damage . Each time they must be handled and sorted for use , the possibility of damage and error occurrs . Besides , all the extra sorting and handling is waste . Reasons explaining those cases in which synchronized production is difficult or impossible , even in elementary form , fall into three categories :  | 1 . Engineering of the product is unsuitable . At the extreme , a totally custom-designed , unique product is only put together once . 2 . The production process is not developed for it , either not designed for it at all or " quality " problems of various kinds plague it . 3 . Marketing demand is irregular , maybe because the market itself is very unpredictable ? possibly low volume ? or because the sales planning , order entry , and delivery are not developed to promote it . The market may really be unmanageable for some companies ; but , for many others , management does not recognize its potential for creating order from random customer events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little value unless attention is constantly focused on executing it . Linearity is execution at a steady rate of the prime schedules ( usually final assembly ) that everything else feeds directly or indirectly . Development of a uniform load schedule establishes planned cycle times , and executing linear to schedule maintains the cycle times with minimum deviation . The JIT company soon learns to establish constant , visible feedback to workers on the " real time " status of final assembly completions to the planned schedule . In synchronized fabrication and assembly , a common practice is to work only two shifts , using the time in between to catch up should things fall behind . The interval between shifts is also useful for preventive maintenance , trials of process improvement ideas , and trials for new product tooling . The time can also be used for improving the skills of the work force ? formally and informally . Not all companies have fabrication and assembly . Some have processes that must run three shifts . But any company striving for continuous improvement should strive to plan and execute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for synchronization and useful for studying improvement , and ( 2 ) keeps a little capacity in reserve for catch-up , self-renewal , and improvement .  | In fabrication and assembly , the fear sometimes is that not having a third shift reduces effective capacity . Short-run it does . Long-run , two shifts working on constant improvement will be well ahead of three spending no time on self-renewal . MATCHING THE UNIFORM SCHEDULE TO THE MARKET ( AND VICE VERSA ) Where to start ? Physical changes and people development are necessary , but true JIT flow production can not occur without the schedule for it . Developing this is less a scheduling method than learning how to operate the company in a different way . Organize the random patterns of customer demand into periods of uniform schedule , each different from the last one . Perform this organizing process in as short a lead time as possible . 1 . Production . What are necessary entities to schedule to provide a basis for capturing the potential for repetitive activity ? for setting the dominant " drumbeat " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations ? the cycle time concept . 2 . Marketing . How can we remove unnecessary influences that cause erratic transmission of market demand into the production process ? 3 . Matching . How can the flow of market demand be matched with useful periods of uniform load production schedule ? The schedules to be uniform loaded are typically final assembly schedules or something approximating them , and conditions of schedule development are in three categories : ( 1 ) make-to-stock , ( 2 ) make-to-order , and ( 3 ) **29;1263;TOOLONG ( often a variation on make-to-order ) . Many companies combine all three cases in developing the uniform load schedule for a single operation , so the situation can become quite complex . The objective is simplifying this confluence of factors in any way possible . Make-to-Stock The planning for distribution inventory should be on the same planning cycle as the length of the production periods , so production  | planning always takes place using the freshest possible estimates of need . That is , if the production period is two weeks , replan the demand for finished goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan just prior to devising the uniform production schedule . Plan the distribution inventory to cover specific periods : Lot size for period coverage demand of all items to be produced . ( Not every item in stock may be produced in each production period . ) Avoid coupling reorder point systems to uniform load production scheduling . These create irregular lot sizes sent to production planning at irregular times , and they will make this type scheduling impossible or nearly so . The so-called savings from economic lot sizes is illusory . Most such lot sizing is done by assuming that items in the product line are independent in their demand and that any item can be reordered at any time . This aggregates the normal random pattern of demand over different " random " lengths of time and passes it to production . Think time coverage over equal lengths of time to marshall demand and match demand patterns to schedule periods . Use the finished goods inventory to perform its function of buffering random swings in demand from the schedule . A very useful form of finished goods management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Consider the finished goods as stock to meet demand until the schedule can be reworked the next time , and base the stocking level on that . The amount to be produced is whatever was sold last period plus any inventory adjustment considered necessary for safety purposes . Items having mild upward or downward trends are handled by " sales replacement " with little ado , and the objective is not to create artificial blips in demand unaware . Have field stock locations reorder stable demand items by " sales replacement " also . That is , they should order to cover recent sales without increasing inventory to provide for a possible permanent uptrend in that item . Field ordering policies should transmit through the distribution channel pretty much what has been sold . Try to prevent overreacting to random swings in demand . A forecast is necessary for all items not having stable demand patterns , so try not to make an unstable demand pattern where none exists . Seasonal items require building to forecast . So do those subject to demand fluctuations from the company 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me-  | chanical forecasting are more accurate than others for a given purpose , but none work as well as trying to identify and take into account known causes of demand change . For this , a good relationship with marketing is necessary . If marketing folk are inventory minded , they will tend to forecast high so as to have a full wagon to sell from . Converting them to thinking time coverage and production response is no small task but a necessary one if they are to provide estimates of demand change that are true deviations from random variance in a demand pattern . In a company stocking thousands of items , this might be a small percentage of the total items . The idea is to operate the uniform load schedule from as closein and stable a position as possible . Then , attempt to run as much production from the uniform load schedule as possible . Planning ahead for capacity and for long lead time suppliers takes more forecasting . That difference is important to keep in mind . Trends up and down and market-caused changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . However , if the planning horizon for materials commitment can be shortened , reliance of company operations on long-term forecasts can be reduced . After they get rolling , make-to-stock companies can reduce finished goods stock levels , but an increase in finished goods is not unusual in the start-up stages . First , the production operations may have some interruptions to make adjustments and improvements . Second , a company may justifiably not have all the confidence in the world at the outset . Only after establishing production 's ability to operate responsively to uniform loading will this confidence develop to a point where finished goods levels will decrease . The reason for the reduction is that production enters finished goods more as a steady stream rather than in large lot sizes . Much of the finished goods remaining is safety stock and pipeline stock . The ultimate objective is to provide the equivalent of off-theshelf delivery from production ? no finished goods inventory . Flexible , short lead-time production may actually provide better service than if inventory is stocked . If production has a long lead time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and customer service suffers anyway . 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson is an example of a production process well down the road toward this effect . Because of the daily  | uniform loading , production every day is working in the service of many different customers . Customer orders no longer wait so long in a backlog for their turn to be serviced one-at-a-time . Flexibility is much improved . Make-to-Order Synchronized make-to-order production seldom incorporates custom design . That is job shop work ? too little potential to capture repetitive patterns . Synchronizable work is assemble-to-order , often with option mixes to contend with . One example is aut6mobiles . A symbiotic relationship exists between auto manufacturers and their dealers ; but yes , from the viewpoint of schedule construction , autos are built to order everywhere in the world . Some orders are one-of-a-kind combinations ; others are fleet orders for hundreds of identical units . Another example is Singer , who builds consumer items differentiated by trim and logo for the Sears and K Marts of the world . Customers want delivery in either large or small quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A third example is Briggs &; Stratton . Their small engines have a seasonal demand pattern and are modified to fit hundreds of different applications by the equipment manufacturers to whom they sell . Uniform load schedules in the make-to-order case are developed from the backlog of orders , but where do these orders come from ? Sometimes they come from orders to replenish inventory ? the customer 's inventory . If the customers understood how they might benefit from doing so , their ordering of numerous items might be done on a " sales replacement " basis in time cycles compatible with the manufacturer 's production periods . This example does not sufficiently cover the make-to-order situation . Automobiles are an example of orders being a mix of ( 1 ) " sales replacement " orders for dealer stocks , ( 2 ) dealer orders based on their anticipation of local demand preference changes , and ( 3 ) vehicle orders demanded by users themselves ? both individual and fleet orders . The waiting time of all customers must be competitive . A very uniform schedule could be constructed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a problem . Customer orders should be assigned to time segments  | according to delivery promise and made during a production period matching that time segment . Even so , a large backlog is a long wait for the average customer , so the time segments should be short as possible , and the preparation time for them as short as possible . Preparation time is necessary before a segment of uniform load schedule can be executed . First , orders must be entered into segments of time , or " buckets , " which correspond to the production periods . They must be confirmed . Can the customer pay ? Is the order correct ? Once a bucket of orders is as firm as marketing can make them , they are transferred to production . Before production ever receives the new bucket of orders , marketing should have selected orders and quoted deliveries in such a way that production does not have an impossible task aligning them into uniform load patterns . Then final planning begins . Personnel transfers , tooling preparations , or even layout changes must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the periods leading up to it , and finally the schedule is executed at the correct time . A rough form of this procedure is sketched in Figure 7-1 . First , marketing and production have to learn how to basically operate this way . Then , if marketing can become sharper marshalling demand and if production can become sharper preparing to execute , lead time to the customer might be reduced . Schedule periods might become shorter , one less period might be needed to prepare for production , or orders might transfer from marketing daily instead of weekly . This process can be complicated in many ways . Suppose a company has five plants , each capable of producing the same line of product except for a few details of optional configurations . The transport distance and the option content restrictions must be managed in parceling out the orders in time segments to each plant , and , in addition , orders will be traded between plants unless forbidden . Keeping it simple requires concentration on eliminating the possibilities that make it complicated . One myth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviolate ; that is , once marketing has handed the backlog to production , no order changes are permissible . A heavy degree of discipline is necessary , but some changes are always permissible . If a customer cancels , the order must be dropped . In desperation cases , an order can be added ; likewise , changes to orders  | figure can be made ? but not very many . Marketing must have enough discipline to protect the integrity of the production system by refusing to disserve the many customers on behalf of a favored few . How long a schedule segment ? Long enough to allow synchronization of operations through which material flows , but how long that must be depends on the status of the production process for quality , dependability , and flexibility ( Chapters 3 through 6 ) . Over time , an objective is to develop a production process that can quickly respond to real changes in market rate and mix , but the development takes discipline . Short lead times make this discipline easier to achieve . A large backlog and long lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time before they become serious . Large backlogs are loaded with orders that will never be built : quotes never accepted , possible orders never completely defined , " maybe orders " from customers just waiting in line because they might want something . Managing a close-in backlog is necessary for marketing to help align orders to time segments in a preliminary way . Several other  | kinds of considerations can affect the timing of actual production . Two of them are : 1 . Credit terms causing orders to bunch instead of spread . If customers have , for instance , until the 10th of the month following delivery to pay , by no accident will many of them want delivery in the first week of the month to maximize time before payment . 2 . Transportation planning often " lumps " production of a given type . Items must all meet a particular train or boat . In some cases , shipping times must be coordinated with other plants ( peripherals for a mainframe computer are one example ) . Discounts , promotions , selling practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers for large lots shipped all at one time or for long-term orders made and shipped as needed . With this concept in mind , the search for transport economics shifts from hauling large lots at irregular times to hauling mixed loads at regular times . Marketing then beckons customers to work within a smoothly flowing system rather than disrupt it . Developing a uniform load schedule specific to the business situation is one of the most difficult aspects of JIT/TQ manufacturing . The situation at the 3M Magnetic Media , Hutchinson plant was simple enough to briefly describe but complex enough to tax the people involved . In the beginning , they could not lay out the steps in a PERT chart but had to piece it together much like solving a jigsaw puzzle . Make-for-Another Manufacturer Supplier companies usually sell to more than one industrial customer , each presenting demands using their own systems . Should these customers happen to operate by uniform load schedules themselves , scheduling by the supplier becomes a matter of matching the production periods and preparation lead times of the customers with the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is underestimated . Blending together a set of out-of-synch cycles is a challenge . The discrepancies in time phasing can only be covered by inventory in some way , and they complicate planning .  | Many industrial customers will only send orders . Some will also send a forecast of orders to come . Organizing this backlog into a uniform load schedule does not differ in principle from organizing the backlog of orders from nonmanufacturing customers . Much depends on how stable the short-term backlog is , and whether it permits blending orders into a uniform load schedule . In turn , that depends on the quality of customers ' operations . Suppliers generally have minimal influence over that except in the way they select customers . The reasons uniform load scheduling is so difficult include not only confusion over sources of disruption to uniformity and how to remove them but also the nature of customers . A company selling to any major customer with a " big inventory " mentality is unlikely to suggest that the customer change its buying practices as one of the first moves in JIT/TQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only by concentrating on that in a unified way can the company ( production , product engineering , and marketing ) mold the complexity into a simple pattern . Making the complicated look easy is mastery of it . CUT LEAD TIMES AND SIMPLIFY SYSTEMS Large inventories and long lead times are both associated with complex systems , and complex systems are both harder to understand and harder to change than simple ones . The workings and ramifications of simple systems are easy to understand . Omark Industries ' Oroville , California , facility quickly converted a simple reorder point system for finished goods to a time-coverage system to better uniform load its schedules . Both systems were easy-toprogram procedures used in the same room as the inventory . Complex real processes must be represented by complex systems , but not all complex real processes need to remain that way . Simplify reality and the system representing it can also simplify . Changing a computer system makes no change in reality ? transport , tooling , location , layout , work method , or even use of the product by customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for continuous improvement thinking , and believing otherwise is a common sinkhole.  | Administrative people working with a system far from the activity it represents see only symbols of reality , not the reality itself . Should they begin to confuse the two , they will believe that if a system to " optimize " shop operations is devised , surely real improvement will follow . Improvement changes suggested in this way may go in a helpful direction , but they do not execute themselves , and the programs require data for the remote control . Real improvement consists of straightening and simplifying the value-adding operations themselves , pruning unnecessary activities in the process . Why not do as much as possible by viewing the reality directly ? using the activities themselves as their own system ? ( Visibility systems do that ? or come close . ) All staff should deal as directly as possible with real operations , real product , and real customers . They should be aware of the visibility principle and use it , even when developing computerized systems . Then they can snip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler ones . Control of operations is also confused for continuing improvement ? control by recording where everything is and what is done . Auditable transactions require discipline , and in-control is preferable to out-of-control larceny and confusion . Beyond this , control is not improvement . Disciplined management of waste is still waste . Improvement by remote control suggests that a number is out of line and , if no more is known of reality , recommends that " Somebody do something . " Simplification of systems comes through abandoning activities once thought necessary and eliminating the lead time associated with them . Operations , inventories , inspections , and delays that no longer exist no longer need to be planned and controlled ? neither scheduled nor budgeted nor reported . However , in transition , the existing complex systems still expect data feeds from these severed appendages to keep going , and without some system capability , essential planning and control of residual activities are endangered if new systems can not function yet . This possibility is harrowing even for those whose view of reality is not obfuscated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define the needs of customers , plan future operations , and assure that assets are as stated . The objective is to do this without waste , but escaping from complex systems  | is , for many , not a simple matter . Relapsing into a complex system to manage waste is an easy way out . PRODUCTION PLANNING AND CONTROL SYSTEMS Many companies call these materials systems or even inventory systems . Their primary planning and control of production is through materials planning and inventory status , but much more is necessary for smoothly-flowing production : tooling , maintenance , material handling , and personnel , among others . Rolling that all together into one big , interconnected computer system for a plant of any size creates a monster system . Such a system is technically possible with good preparation , but expensive ; and such systems are charming only if the plant has few problems of quality , maintenance , shortages , and the like . In practice , materials requirements planning ( MRP ) systems are tailored to fit the circumstances ; butinthe professional jargon , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of bills of material , using time-offset scheduling , and adjusting each part quantity by netting out the number still held in inventory . Significant errors in bills of material , inventory balances , or order quantities create a garbage-in , garbage-out situation , so these systems require accountancy-level attention to clerical accuracy . Most companies working their way into JIT/TQ are not in a position to construct a monster system . The majority have a history of some version of MRP . Changes to the system depend on the status of MRP development when the company began a new direction and on the degree of evolution since then . MRP systems were originally established to model the company operations somewhat as they existed at the time of MRP installation . If the basic overview of materials flow changed little , the basics of the MRP system changed little . Inductoheat needed no major MRP programming surgery . The company remained a job shop , the bills of material were simple from the beginning , and the computerized version of the system needed no enhancement . The 3M Magnetic Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it developed a uniform load schedule . The key is good discipline with a simple system . Job Shops A true job shop must plan and control irregular-quantity , irregulartimed jobs using job orders without any pull system . Simplicity can be attained in several ways : 1 . Minimum levels in the bills of material . Fewer stock levels to plan and control , fewer part numbers to manage , less time for system processing and maintenance , and fewer systems transactions to manage . To accomplish this , the job shop must attain visible control over its work-in-process inventory to substitute for moving material in and out of inventory . Visibility helps control even long routings through many operations . 2 . Simple lot sizing . Making only what is needed ( lot-for-lot ) is a good formula . Lot sizes in nice , round , easily counted numbers is another . If material must be built ahead for stock , lot-size for time coverage so that , for instance , once a quarter every member of a given family of parts is built . That procedure begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum possible use of direct visibility . This minimizes the need for elaborate shop floor tracking by remote system . It also permits easy tracking of a schedule by those responsible for the " support " activities : tooling , maintenance , material handling , etc. 4 . Do not overload a shop with work that can not be done . If a shop has a flexible work force and flexible equipment , capacity planning is simplified . Do not overload total labor-hours or total machine-hours and the work will probably get out . Keep work-inprocess small and expect prompt attention . Large WIP complicates systems and destroys workplace organization . Make priority choices on work before it goes into the shop , not while it is there . Inductoheat is a small job shop in which control by visibility of the main assembly schedule is very effective . Larger facilities must think more deeply about it , but visibility methods can be devised once minds are set toward them . Space for queues waiting at machines can be marked and limited . ( No space for it , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibility system for material control was observed at a huge plant of Hitachi Heavy Industries . The jobs were large-scale metalworking : big turbines , reactor vessels , and so on , and all were custom designed . Each work center kept work orders and shop paper for jobs in queue in file drawers of a cabinet with easily removable drawers . The job in the top drawer was the next one to work on . When it was finished , all drawers moved up a slot . Paper for a jdb to be moved into a work center was placed in the lowest empty drawer . If the lowest drawer was already full , no material was moved in . Each work center had only as many drawers as could hold a few days ' work ? effective queue control . All workers knew that a job in the bottom drawer should be worked out by week 's end , for instance ; and a work center starting to bottleneck rapidly became apparent to anyone feeding it , and their duty was to stop and help offload the overworked point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow shop before moving toward JIT probably reflected that orientation in its MRP system , thus fewer radical changes would be necessary . The conversion of MRP systems is a case-by-case situation . The most severe systems rebuilding occurs if a company greatly changes both in physical process and in method of control ; that is , from a highly transaction-oriented , detail-scheduled job shop approach to a minimal transaction , pull system , high-visibility flow shop . If a pull system of control is used for a flow shop , final operations will draw the parts and materials they need when needed . However , supplying operations must be prepared to respond . They need a plan for each schedule period stating the daily parts quantities that will be required and the rate at which they will be used . From this , supervisors and operators can prepare layouts , tooling , and workplace organization to respond . Some deviations from exact quantities can be handled if all areas have prepared for that possibility in advance . If material is to flow like clockwork , material handling and transport schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivery times . Once supervisors know those and the part volume estimates for the period , they can prepare  | detailed area plans : tooling , setups , maintenance , quality checks , personnel , and so on . They are close enough to the action to integrate the level of detail . An overview of this planning is shown in Figure 7 ? 2 . Since few companies can put all parts on some version of pull system flow at once , their planning systems look a little like Figure 7 ? 3 and might remain that way a long time . Part of it sets up pull system operations . Part of it does more conventional time-offsetting and gross-to-net calculations for long lead time and large lot-size parts . Those should be placed in an inventory from which a pull system can draw . The inventory must be controlled ? visibly or otherwise . Unfortunately , Figure 7 ? 3 understates the magnitude of the potential mess . Some companies base their master materials schedule on a final assembly schedule , and their bills of material are structured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on forecasted use of families of material that are stored in inventory when finished . Final assembly later draws from that . The bills of material for those two kinds of systems may be very different , and they may differ in other particulars . In such a case , a company may be well advised to just start a new MRP system and let it consume the old one as physical changes permit . Reform of the old one is too complicated . Running dual systems is messy , but in the end the company should have one simple system and less waste . Inventory hidden in stockrooms must be accounted for . Each " random-time , random-quantity " put away and withdrawal must be recorded . Standard containers with standard numbers of parts in each simplify this procedure , but it is still work . Stock levels must be periodically verified and cost valued . In addition to stockrooms , inventory siphoned off into other sizable clusters not under strict visible-limit control needs some form of transactional verification ? regardless of nobility of purpose : quality testing , traceability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is set aside in a significant little pile , a system has to record it . Figure 7 ? 4 diagrams a " conventional " production process . It is a simplified sketch of lead times in several categories for only one case of manufacturing . The same plant often has several cases . Each activity shown in lead time has some kind of system associated with it . All activities and delays shown might be separate classifications in a complex materials system .  | figure Every time an activity disappe s , the system should withdraw from it and contract , but in man companies systems are huge and expensive . An effort can bog down because analyst and programming power is not sufficient to cut through all this muck . Managers , once dependent on systems as their handle on the business , are fearful of the chaos that would result from disturbing too much at once . Figure 7 ? 5 is a simplified sketch showing how a hierarchical bill of materials structure could modify and simplify as actual processes change . This view is indeed simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not based on end items , the entire set of planning bills may need to change . In addition , most companies with MRP have more than one bill of materials . Some have four or five , each with its own systems purpose . Stagnation in these problems is the major reason JIT champions must keep everyone 's attention on slicing out unnecessary activities and bridging over old systems . Otherwise , no one will ever wade out of complex materials ( and other ) systems . The particulars depend much on the individual case , but a few common materials systems conversion problems are : Inventory Accounting . As long as inventory is kept in stockrooms , it must be safeguarded by a transaction system . These trans-figure  | figure actions can be eliminated when inventory is in standard containers in visible control , as in a pull system under disciplined limits . Attaining this discipline is more than a one-week conversion ; thus , for a time , production controllers and accountants will sweat out count verifications daily on the shop floor . A small amount of inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if it is in designated locations and standard containers . An hour or two once a month should do it . Counts are taken by the operators . Supervisory efforts to strictly limit the amount of inventory should result in a shortage being much more serious for reasons other than a data error . Eliminating Inventory Transactions . If a company wishes to terminate processing inventory transactions every time material is used , it can do so by post-deduct or " backflush . " Multiply the number of assemblies complete by the number of parts in the bill of materials for each . Subtract these numbers from the work-in-figure  | figure process inventory figures . A company with visible , straight-through production should be able to maintain inventory just by counting parts into process and backflushing them out . The problem is that if the MRP system or inventory systems are not programmed to do this , reprogramming is not easily done . Most companies develop a dummy transaction record from the  | backflush process , then play the record against the system , fooling it into thinking transactions took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save up the changes for one trip to major surgery rather than do the job many times as changes take place a few at a time . " Turning off " Modules of a System . The problem is that doing this also turns off data processing still wanted for other purposes . Suppose a quality hold area is eliminated , but the system will not run without verification of quality hold counts . Set counts to zero and keep them there , or perform whatever other dummy data entry is necessary . The hazard is destroying some form of data feed needed for the system to perform replanning . Systems are minefields full of such things , and the only advice is caution . A major process revision and simplification eventually requires a new system . The instinct of systems people is to search for it too soon ? before they are fully into a new method of operation . They spend so much time doctoring old syste . s that they seek relief , and getting sidetracked into systems churning is a danger . To break out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary activities and delays , and determining how to synchronize the company into uniform load segments of schedule . New systems can be built around that , but not before the framework for them is in place . When the framework is in place , a serious push must be made to kill off an old complex system and get into a new one . A large group of people can not live long with either a bandaged system or dual systems . The confusion is expensive , and sinking back into the morass is too easy . COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS To determine a cost , start with two questions : ( 1 ) Who wants to know the cost ? and ( 2 ) Why do they want to know it ? Costing has many reasons , some at cross-purposes . Some of the major ones are : 1 . Cost-based pricing . 2 . Operating decisions : make/buy , distribution changes , process changes , etc.  | 3 . Performance measures of managers and units . 4 . Financial reporting . Ideally , one would like a simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still giving consistent results . This is self-contradictory and therefore impossible . Assign a business case to a group of intelligent M.B.A.s , some of them practicing accountants . Ask them to cost the same proposals in a situation calling for judgment determining relevant costs and allocating indirect costs . Results will vary considerably depending on student assumptions and methods . There is no reason to expect universal agreement on cost models . Many accountants might agree that one is especially bad for its purpose , but hardly any will agree on the one ideal method to cost the same situation . All accountants should arrive at the same figure for a cash account and for the valuation of payables , receivables , and inventory ? though even these require judgments on collectability , obsolescence , and the like . Cost allocations and attributions are judgment calls . If everyone in a company had a personal computer and organized costs as they deemed reasonable to fit the situation , there would be no agreement among them without arguing out their assumptions and methods . Companies try to develop consistency by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . However , all cost systems have assumptions built into them : systemic cost biases . Cost figures must be compiled in some way , and the systemic biases come with them . However , decisions do not have to be based on cost figures known to grossly mis-model alternatives considered . Fully loaded cost figures used for price basing may not be at all appropriate for comparing operations alternatives . Managers and accountants may use them anyway rather than work through the issues of judgment involved , and thus systemic cost bias affects the direction of management decisions . Some of the accounting issues associated with JIT/TQ are : 1 . Interpretation of costs for management direction . 2 . Systemic cost biases inappropriate to future management direction .  | 3 . Complex cost systems . 4 . Changing cost systems to better fit a new process . Interpretation of Costs for Management Direction Manufacturing excellence probably can not be attained by a management whose judgment is utterly cost dependent . Progress is seen as a series of independent cost decisions rather than as a long-term direction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost methods used , whatever they are . This amounts to a rather single-minded management pursuit of provable cost reduction . Morale improvement , visibility improvement , or even cost-benefit of defect elimination are extremely difficult to prove out by any system of costing that considers only tangible relevant costs . Such a management will reject the notion of spending $15,000 to change a layout that will save $15,000 in floor space on grounds that nothing is changed , and the space will not be used for anything else . The same management might well sped $15,000 for extra space at a marketing exposition . No one can finger any tangible results in advance , but without marketing presence over a period of time , market position will slip , and so continuing effort must be made . Some of it results in a payoff . The same is true of continuous improvement effort in manufacturing . Some changes will undoubtedly be mistakes , and cost information is important because no one wishes to go broke with one mistake . By the same token , costing should not exercise veto power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of independent cost centers is a problem for interpreting costs also , no matter how the independent costs are collected and structured . The assumption is that driving the direct costs of each of 10 operations to a minimum will reduce total cost . The vague hope is that total overhead and indirect cost will reduce at least in proportion . However , indirect costs and overhead are reduced when the total pattern of production is simplified . When production is complicated , the costs of managing the whole mess must increase , which comes out as indirect and overhead cost .  | An operation working to cycle times has an excellent basis for costing in the cycle times themselves . Planned cycle times , multiplied by cost factors , are planned costs . If production is always caught up with the schedule at the end of each shift , the only variance from the cycle time cost is any necessary overtime . Detailed operations variances from costs not based on cycle times mean little . A company zeroing in on defects keeps good records on defects . Defect reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no acceptable defect level , but rather targets for improvement . As a company develops its thinking into continuous improvement , it begins to question the value of standards which may have extra time and " normal " defect allowances built in . If the value of the standards is suspect , there is little reason for reporting variances against them . The reporting of actual costs based on cycle times and the actual data from operations is relatively simple . A production operation is likely to have two costs : actual costs and target costs based on the various targets for improvement . Before launching a major campaign to revise cost systems , first examine management need for cost data and management attitude toward managing with costs . Two extreme examples may help . A plant controller was appointed plant manager and immediately decreed that from now on the plant would be operated strictly by budget . Detailed budgets were already established operationby-operation , and the man poured over the variance reports daily . Managers and supervisors were penalized for being either over or under variance . So much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cautious so as to be manipulated within cost budgets . Overall direction : Zero . At the opposite extreme was a fast-growth company with undeveloped process costing . Product costs were estimated according to which of three classes they belonged , determined by how many of over 200 operations they passed through . It was impossible to know for certain whether the total production cost of any single product had moved plus/minus 10 percent , though a guesstimate could be derived from the changes in routing and yields before and after a process change . The company did not even have an aggregate beginning benchmark cost by product . The moral : Try to set some initial benchmark costs by plant , by department , and by product , but do not delay everything while waiting on this . Better to have cost reductions than to know pre-  | cisely how much they were . Track the reductions in overall costs and keep tight reign on overall budgets . Let managers use judgment about detailed changes so as to bring them together into an overall pattern that will produce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall direction toward improvement . Systemic Cost Biases The most common is allocation of high overhead percentages to direct labor costs . As direct labor becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of total cost , allocations become distorted ; and by the time direct labor is 5 percent or less of total cost , almost everyone thinks the costing is crazy . Overhead costs may go through several stages of reallocation among each other , but in a factory they all come to rest on direct production costs , allocated on some basis . Other than direct labor , a common basis is machine time . Companies transitioning to JIT/ TQ talk about allocating cost in other ways . One method is allocating on the basis ofanaterial throughput time or by level of work-in-process inventory . This is presumed to indicate the consumption of overhead resources . The problem with it is the necessity for tracking the base measure ( throughput time or WIP ) , which is not difficult if production is uniform loaded . However , interruptive rush work that occasionally enters such a flow needs to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost will be " unfairly " low . Those jobs really take the overhead in such a system , and they will appear to be more profitable then they really are . Another method is allocating cost on the basis of transaction volume required to process each product through a plant . These are countable if defined as such and if a computer system is programmed to keep them . This method promotes the introduction of low-transaction , simple processes but also the suppression of transactions , which might not be the thing to do universally . Why not allocate costs on any reasonable basis for cost-based pricing and financial accounting , but make operating decisions based only on direct , relevant costs ? This old controversy usually bogs down in the necessity to estimate some costs by allocation for operating decisions . For instance , what is the cost of maintaining a machine ?  | Direct costing in the pure sense probably can not be adhered to for operating decisions , but this direction seems sensible . Keep cost systems simple . The purpose of costing for operations decisions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not every manufacturer has a complex cost system , but many do . Ask most managers which systems chew up the most computer time , and they will say materials systems and accounting systems . Conceptually changing cost systems seems easy , but changing a complex one is subject to the same problems as changing a complex materials system . Complex manufacturing accounting systems often have their own bills of material similar to , but slightly different from , the bills of materials used for materials systems . They are used for denoting the points where costs are accumulated in the production process . If a design change or process change occurs , the accounting bill of materials ? and the cost structure it represents ? also changes . Accounting systems are no more programmed for versatility than most large materials systems . They do not ease the transition into JIT/TQ thinking . Changing Cost Systems Probably the worst-case scenario is conversion from a job shop operating method with job orders to flow shop methods without job orders . The job orders represent the transaction medium to which most cost reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the method of costing must change from job costing to some form of process costing . Both are textbook costing methods , but conversion from one to the other is both work and trauma . The trauma occurs because the data collection of costs for financial accounting is affected , which is more serious than cost reallocations for managerial accounting . This brings up the problem of reconciling costs under a new system with those under the old . Otherwise , no one knows whether a reported profit ( or loss ) is " real " or just a figment of restating the basis of costs . Auditors ( and tax authorities ) insist that financial statements be consistently stated from one year to the next , thus systems must operate in dual long enough to benchmark comparisons .  | In addition to this aspect of system change , no controller wants to be in a position where costs seem unaccounted for in internal reporting . A conscientious accountant is likely to spend many hours verifying that visible control systems really work and assets did not disappear somewhere . VISIBILITY OFF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system changing seems a bit complex , the principle of simplifying it is visibility . Try to avoid the situation in which each analyst off the floor sees only a small part of the system dealt with . Post schedules in offices as well as in factories . Post targeted objectives and attainment toward them . Try to make systems do double duty . For instance , try to make the accounting system and the materials system use the same bills of material . Make transactions serve multiple purposes . For instance , one scrap reporting transaction should serve for accounting system , materials system , and quality system . Staff instinct is to crawl off in a corner with their own little pile of data . Stimulate interaction by having them use the same data . ( One set of data from one source is a staff version of workplace organization . Keeping data at the scene of action helps too . Those gathering it know what it is . Those seeing it can easily put it in context , and not too much will be asked for . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , but the objective is to keep a high level of total awareness so that time is not spent correcting mismatched data , correcting errors , and discovering other staff 's oversights . JIT thinking applies to support work as well as to shop work . Finally , any system is foremost a people system . The human is an integral part . Integrative systems design is accomplished by developing people and systems together .  | The External Factory ? Suppliers Half of the average manufacturer 's production cost is purchased material . If internal production is mostly assembly , as much as 80 percent of cost of goods sold is pass-through from suppliers . Competitive manufacturers must manage this external factory by the same philosophy as the internal one . Think of a materials supplier in the operating sense . The true supplier is the last operation touching material in a remote facility . The true customer is the first operation to use the material received . Anything that unnecessarily complicates a simple hand-off of material from one to the other is superfluous ? waste . Other activities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : product design , certainty of quality , schedule , containerization , transport , and financing . If one is trying to eliminate waste , detailed decisions on all these should not be necessary for each shipment . This simple concept mightily contradicts established business practice . American companies find it difficult to strip away the layers of custom that smother operation-to-operation supplier relationships with different ownership at each end of the line . Doing so is not easy if the supply relationships are inside the same company . In large companies , a frequent complaint is that the worst suppliers are other plants belonging to the same company . Speculative reasons for this begin with the observation that " internal " suppliers seldom have a marketing department campaigning for internal customers ' interests with the same vigor as for external customers . A sale with exchange of real money wins more attention than one checked off with a mere accounting transfer .  | Companies try to counteract the apathy by having internal suppliers compete with external ones for business . A little excitement is added along with increased negotiation expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To attain that , managements must become excited about the dull subjects of quality and waste . In Figure 8-1 , a single rolling mill should feed coil stock to the same press . Why ? Because one problem in quick setups of presses ( and attaining consistently good parts ) is nonhomogenous coil stock . Gauge variance and inclusions must be compensated for . The same rolling mill is a consistent physical source . The conditions of roll forming should be known , and the mill should be interested in improving the quality of output for its users . If it does not , go to the physical source and work it out immediately , just as if the operation were part of the press shop production . This action sounds logical , but small companies do not buy from a mill . They buy from warehouses , and the mill source may or may not be consistent . If the steel is inadequate , the expedient recourse is to shop for better . Even for large companies buying mill-direct , having press shop technicians and operators visit the rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea many would take seriously . Mill technicians have time to talk to only a handful of thousands of actual users of their output , and a s quq ad of various technical and managerial intermediaries would have to be straightarmed for the actual users to get through to them . This same situation is all too often true of castings from foundries , motors from winding operations , and other materials coming from production processes separated by geographical distance and great organizational chasms . Barriers to operation-to-operation production networks are geographic , traditional , organizational , and perhaps even legal in some instances . The objective of an operation-to-operation network of suppliers is constant improvement , and within that the first priority is quality . The external factory is a mutual improvement society . It should be organized so that if something goes amiss , the concerned party should know who to contact at the source of the problem and how to go about making improvement immediately . Quality service from a supplier is more than having an SQC program and prompt delivery ? a techniquish view of JIT/TQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reside with the supplier companies either , so this is not a strictly dictate-to-the-supplier arrangement . The need is for **28;1294;TOOLONG relationships to promote quality and eliminate waste . The techniques come from that . Many U.S. companies have in recent years tightened quality requirements for suppliers , and many have arrangements for daily deliveries from at least a few suppliers . But most of these arrangements still do not approach the necessary spirit of the operationto-operation network ? something that pervades the relationship between two companies when it really exists . Most of the great examples are still Japanese . An incident touring an American JIT/TQ plant with some JIT/ TQ-oriented Japanese illustrates the point . The American plant had made great strides , but at one operation an irritating problem was observed with a purchased part . The instinct of the Japanese was  | to immediately go to the physical supplier operation and work it out . This did not occur to the Americans ; for them , " immediately " was as soon as appropriate persons could organize to focus on the problem intelligently and figure out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchasing , marketing , and engineering involvement by the two companies . To the Japanese , much of this was time wasted and merely delayed getting to the core of the situation . Many large American manufacturers have computer links directly to suppliers , or they are contemplating them . Usually these links are **34;1324;TOOLONG , or they are links to track shipments . Too few are based on thinking through what is necessary for a minimum-waste linkage between two operations , with direct , immediate feedback for quality . ( A few may be getting close . For instance , Lear-Siegler builds and delivers car seats to Chrysler on-line and real-time in assembly sequence . ) Companies must start internal improvement programs first . Those who start to develop suppliers should be far enough along themselves to understand what they are trying to achieve . Many companies push suppliers into carrying inventory and refining delivery methods before either operation is ready for it , sometimes adding to waste rather than subtracting from it . Mutual trust is an obvious issue . Understandably , a supplier will not divulge its trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality if there is the slightst hint that the customer might compete in the same business or provide tips to competitors . In other words , developing a shipping schedule and containerization program is only a part of mutually improving quality and reducing cost . The core assumptions of how one does business are shaken . Negotiating strategies change . Concepts of whether one got a " good deal " alter . Ask the average business advisor whether a purchase agreement is a good one , and the instinct is to say yes if the work went to the lowest bidder qualified for the work . A set of long-term supply relationships is apt to be seen as a cozy arrangement to fatten the select few , and without competent people in both camps being pressed for continuous improvement , that condition may well develop .
