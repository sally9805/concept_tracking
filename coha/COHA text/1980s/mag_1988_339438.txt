Neil Kinnock was a worried man as he mounted the podium in Blackpool last week . As the Labor Party met for its annual conference , the latest polls showed that only one voter in four expects it to form a government in the next ten years . He knew that once again his leadership was on trial . <P> The conference had started well enough for Kinnock . He easily defeated a left-wing attempt to replace him and won endorsement of a key policy document for reforming the party and making it electable again  --  mainly by forsaking the goal of wholesale nationalizations . Then he delivered a confident , well- applauded speech in which he called on Labor to come to terms with the " fact of the market economy . " He sought to seize the initiative from Margaret Thatcher 's Tory government with his emphasis on environmental issues , individualism and competitiveness . When Kinnock insisted that no " slide to the right " was involved , leftwing Laborites growled , but were shouted down by the moderate majority . <P> Later , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party 's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament  --  he suggested that Britain might retain nuclear weapons while a Labor government took part in arms talks . But the conferees , led by Ron Todd , head of the Transport and General Workers ' Union , instead endorsed unilateralism and called for the removal of all nuclear weapons and bases from Britain . Todd had earlier responded to Kinnock 's keynote address with anger . His temper rising as he spoke , the union leader derided Kinnock 's supporters as " all sharp suits , cordless telephones , glossy pink roses and winning smiles . " <P> So the Labor leader , who knows that for his party to have a realistic chance of governing again , it must embrace unified and politically acceptable positions , watched it succumb to yet more division . Many supporters echoed the hopes of John Edmonds , head of the General Municipal Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union , that Kinnock " has won the party by his speech . " But another senior union boss warned , " If Neil retreats from the gunfire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be out as leader . Not tomorrow , not next week or next month . But before the next election . "
