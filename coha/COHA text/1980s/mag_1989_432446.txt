I @#  | Hedrick Smith suffers from metaphorical myopia . He sees all life , or at least all life in Washington , in terms of games : the image game , the agenda game , the coalition game , the turf game , the survival game , the blame game ... Television , of course , reveres games almost as much as it does best sellers , which may help explain why its adaptation of Smith 's widely praised book , " The Power Game , " emerges as a winner ( sorry , it must be contagious ) . A former Washington bureau chief for The New York Times with longtime insider access , Smith understands how the capital really works and why , at times , it barely works at all . It took him 793 pages to enlighten readers . Public TV has scrunched Smith 's tome into four one-hour install ments . For once , compression in the pursuit of viewer digestion is no vice . PBS 's " The Power Game , " which runs over four nights next week , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid to ask , lest someone actually tell us . As the series ' tour guide , Smith proffers a familiar premise . The 1974 post-Watergate elections , which created an army of young , reform-minded congressmen , set off a " power earthquake " that fragmented the very heart of our national government . What 's not so obvious , at least to anyone outside the Beltway , are the disastrous consequences wreaked by the busting up of the Old Guard seniority system that had given the Tip O'Neills and Strom Thurmonds their legislative clout . The series dissects them with a pathologist 's precision . Congress splintered into hundreds of autonomous ? and directionless ? fiefdoms . Power gradually passed to the un- elected : political-action committees ( 3,500 at last count ) and ego-driven staff members ( 25,000 ) , the hungriest of whom have a larger say over policy than their bosses . Smith presents a Pentagon obsessed with defending its funding and jobs ( " pork and turf " ) and a White House ruled by media technicians ( their orchestration of President Reagan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outtake from " The Candidate " ) . The result , concludes Smith , is a system of " power float " that too often produces " government gridlock . " Video releases : " The Power Game " is most riveting when it shows rather than tells ? no easy trick when the game 's cardinal rule is to operate out of public view . We see a herd of new-breed congressmen lined up in a Washington park , each waiting to tape the same video press release for their hometown stations ( " State your name and district , " directs a disembodied voice , " and then I 'll ask you , How important is the trade bill ? ' " ( . We watch pro-Israel lobbyists collaring legislators , and Nancy Reagan hesitantly reprising the famous Gridiron Club performance that turned around her media image . Like the book that inspired it , this series abounds with the politically prominent , almost all of whom are angry about some flaw in the system . Smith , too , turns a bit snappish at times . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koppel , who glibly dances around the consequences of his own enormous influence . Hedrick Smith was n't elected to anything , either , for which he can only be grateful . The Washington he portrays in the " The Power Game , " rife with ruthlessness , greed and intrigue , seems a nasty enough place to visit : why would anyone want to live there ?
