Retirees who pull up stakes to resettle elsewhere are by definition not tied to a job , with its geographic constraints . They are freer to opt for ambiance , for ' ' life style , ' ' as the real estate brochures put it. // And they should definitely consider places other than Florida , he feels . It ' s not the gentle sun of the tropics that makes retirement in Asheville attractive , for instance . The attractions of this city in the gently rolling Great Smoky Mountains , where Mr. Boyer has settled , are more diverse than that. // To help people with their search , Mr. Boyer and his partner , David Savageau , have just come out with the ' ' Rand McNally Places Rated Retirement Guide ' ' ( 199 pp. , paperback , $9. 95 ) . // The book considers 107 areas across the country - cities and counties of at least 20 , 000 people which have experienced a definite but not overwhelming influx of retirees in recent years . Included are some old standbys : Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear the authors are particularly interested in new retirement areas - you might almost call them ' ' anti-retirement retirement communities. ' ' // The places that the Boyer-Savageau book considers are sprinkled around the country , through northern California and the Pacific Northwest , over the Southwest , up in New England , as far north as the Bar Harbor-Frenchman Bay area of Maine . And there is a particular concentration in the Appalachians and the Ozarks. // The Appalachians ? The Ozarks ? // The Places-Rated team understands that retirees aren ' t eager to shovel snow ; but they suggest that more temperate climates , with distinct seasons but less extreme extremes , are probably more to most people ' s taste than semitropical heat and humidity or harsh desert. // ' ' People are surprised at how quickly they miss the four seasons ; they think Florida has a great climate , but it has a terrible climate , unless you really want to spend all that time on the beach , ' ' says Mr. Boyer , who laments what he sees as the group-think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe and Sally are there. ' ' // Boyer and Savageau go basically by the numbers . Like their previous , more general ' ' Places Rated Almanac , ' ' which surveyed 277 places across the country for living and working , their retirement guide makes liberal use of various government statistics on such subjects as crime , health-care costs , tax rates , and climate . None of the retirement havens reviewed get any points for aesthetics - or lack of them . And although the two authors have visited most of the places they rate , personal inspections do not figure into their calculations , indicating either laudable objectivity or an unwillingness to be prejudiced by the facts , depending on one ' s point of view. // The book rates all 107 places from six perspectives : climate and terrain ; housing costs ; general costs of living , including taxes ; crime rates , which are an index of community spirit as well as of the general danger level ; health and health care ; and recreation . Also included are helpful sections giving pointers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The book gives overall rankings , but Mr. Boyer says that while these are ' ' interesting , ' ' the best way for people to use the book is as a point of departure for their own research . Different people have different priorities . Family ties may influence your choice of a retirement haven ; and perhaps finding part-time work is more important than having a snow-free climate. // ' ' ' What do I want ? ' and ' What do I want to avoid ? ' are the questions to ask , ' ' Mr. Boyer says. // ' ' You should not use the book to decide to move some place sight unseen , ' ' he adds , scrunched up on the living room sofa in his comfortable brick house on the north side of Asheville , ' ' though some people have done it , and I haven ' t had a disgruntled party yet. ' ' // The first question to ask is , ' ' Do I , or we , really want to move ? ' ' As Boyer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying put . ' ' Not least of which is the value of having roots in a place after one ' s spouse has passed on. // ' ' Most relocating retirees are couples , ' ' Mr. Savageau has observed ; ' ' But 10 years after retirement , 2 out of 3 couples have lost a spouse , ' ' usually the husband , given the gap in life expectancy between men and women - a gap that is increasing . Most retirees do stay put , and most of those who move , move to new quarters in the same town. // On the other hand , packing up and heading for new territory is a grand old American tradition . Mr. Boyer himself , a novelist who also teaches at a nearby college , is far from retirement age . But Asheville came out looking pretty good in the ' ' Places Rated Almanac , ' ' and when a speaking engagement brought him here a while back , he was instantly taken with the place. // And even on a day when rain clouds drag across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undimmed in his enthusiasm for Asheville - No. 2 in his book ' s overall rankings , behind nearby Brevard , N.C. // Asheville is a good example of the kind of place the ' ' Places Rated Guide ' ' recommends , although it doesn ' t get top ranking in any of the six categories . It comes out particularly well in climate and terrain , and health and health care ; in roughly the top quarter on housing and crime ; and pretty much in the middle of the 107 places rated for general costs of living and for recreation . ( Miami , by contrast , is No. 1 in health and health care and No. 2 in recreation , but is dragged down by poor rankings for crime , No. 107 , and housing , No. 95 , to an overall rating of 31. ) // But Boyer concedes that his statistical approach gives Asheville no credit for the beauty of its surroundings . The Smokies are ancient mountains , worn down under the weight of the ages ; western North Carolina is a land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of a beast , of springs that seep out of the rock and become streams and finally reckless plunging waterfalls . If your porch is high enough , you can sit in your rocker of an evening and gaze off to never-never land through the blue mist. // Asheville , with its art deco wedding cake city hall and other architectural treasures , nestles at the juncture of the French Broad and the Swannanoa Rivers . George Vanderbilt built an estate near here in 1895 and got his wealthy friends to come join him ; they built huge houses , many of them now doing service as bed-and-breakfast inns . Asheville blossomed during the 1920s as a cool refuge from the summer heat for wealthy Deep South planters . But the Great Depression ended all that , and the development of air conditioning made a number of hotter Southern resorts bearable through the summer. // There has been a certain turning of the tide , though ; people are deciding that astronomical air conditioning bills are not an improvement on astronomical heating bills. // ' ' I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains , ' ' says one Asheville retiree , a Midwestern executive . ' ' I ' m sitting here watching the snow flurries out my window , and smoke rising from the log cabin a couple of hundred yards down the side of a mountain . In a few minutes I ' m going to go out and chop wood for an hour . Then I ' m going to come in , watch the news , and then have dinner. // ' ' It ' s not a bad life at all.
