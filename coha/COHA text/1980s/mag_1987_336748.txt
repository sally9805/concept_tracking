The greenback must continue to fall , say many economists and now the Administration , if the U.S. is to curb its ruinous trade deficit . But no one can argue that such a strategy offers a simple and painless cure for America 's economic ills . On the contrary , the perils are enormous and the effectiveness is uncertain . The immediate challenge for the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury is to control the dollar 's descent  --  no easy feat  --  and prevent a free fall , which would scare off foreign investors , drive up U.S. interest rates and perhaps cause another panic on Wall Street . But even a gradual decline of the dollar is no panacea . It will impose hardships on the U.S. economy that can not be easily shrugged off , and it may not help nearly as much as Treasury Secretary James Baker and the economists believe . <P> The theory behind the benefits of a currency devaluation is textbook clear : if the dollar falls , the international prices of U.S. products drop , and foreigners will buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods become more expensive in the U.S. , and Americans will reduce demand for imports . A combination of the two trends will lower the trade deficit . <P> That , at least , is the theory . In practice , the mechanisms have been more complex and less effective . Since early 1985 , the dollar has declined by about 50% against major currencies like the Japanese yen and the West German mark . Yet the U.S. trade deficit is as high as ever . Admittedly , it takes time for consumers and businesses to change their buying habits , and an improvement in the trade balance may be in the pipeline . But several forces are holding the deficit up . For one thing , foreign manufacturers have shown a dogged determination to hold down their U.S. prices to maintain market share , even if it means sacrificing profits . Conversely , many U.S. manufacturers have failed to take advantage of the weaker dollar to sell their products aggressively . overseas . <P> More important , price is not the only factor in international buying decisions . Many U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their quality standards ; these products will not sell overseas even if they become cheaper . By the same token , American consumers partial to Toyota cars , Krups kitchen appliances , Rossignol skis and Gucci shoes will not easily be discouraged by price rises . In the case of the videocassette recorder , American consumers have no choice but to buy foreign , since U.S. manufacturers do not make the machines . Indeed , as long as the American appetite for imports remains , a perverse effect takes place : as the price of foreign products increases , Americans spend even more dollars for the same volume of goods . Meanwhile , they earn fewer yen , francs and marks for U.S. products that do sell well abroad , like Boeing aircraft and IBM computers . As a result , the trade deficit actually increases in dollar terms .
