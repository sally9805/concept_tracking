When Felipe Gonzalez Marquez 's Socialists swept to power in 1982 , a jubilant crowd of 4,000 supporters held a raucous celebration outside the party 's election headquarters in Madrid . Fearing a violent rightist reaction , Gonzalez urged his supporters to keep cool , saying , " We do n't want any saviors with machine guns . " Some went to bed that night fearing that the army might try to seize power . <P> Last week , when the Socialists handily won a second term in office , the scene was almost tranquil . Fewer than 200 supporters gathered outside the same election headquarters in the Palace Hotel , and only one , a woman clutching a fistful of red roses , shouted the old political war cry , " Felipe , Felipe ! Felipe Presidente ! " The postelection calm was briefly broken Wednesday when a bomb exploded in checked luggage at the Madrid terminal of El Al , the Israeli airline , injuring 13 people , two of them seriously . <P> Once a land of repressive dictatorship , Spain is taking its ten-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporated , and the majority has steadily moved toward the center . The ruling Socialists have also shifted , abandoning their calls for radical social change . In his campaign , Gonzalez , 44 , calmly asked for four more years to consolidate his party 's gains . <P> Spaniards responded by giving the Socialists 44% of the vote and 184 seats in the 350-member lower house of parliament . While the seat total was 18 fewer than in the 1982 landslide , the party kept its legislative majority . " These results confirm that we have been following the right track , " said Gonzalez . Yet the party 's swerve toward the center created some doubters . Many of the lost Socialist seats were picked up by the Democratic and Social Center Party of Adolfo Suarez , which boosted its representation from two seats to 19 . Suarez , the first elected Prime Minister after the 1975 death of the dictator General Francisco Franco , headed a cautious center-right government . He has since moved to the left of Gonzalez on some issues , and campaigned on a platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain . <P> The Socialist victory was largely a tribute to the charismatic Gonzalez , who has become one of the brightest stars in Europe 's political firmament . Though voters no longer squeal like groupies when the graying-at-the-temples Prime Minister takes a podium , he retains magnetic appeal . " There is less emotionalism than before , " says a senior foreign ministry official . " But he can still convince the man in the street . " Gonzalez did that last March , when he persuaded a skeptical electorate to vote to keep Spain in NATO . <P> The Prime Minister has maintained his popularity despite a Spanish unemployment rate of 22% . His moderate , centrist economic policy " frightens absolutely no one , " as one observer put it . The Socialists have refrained from nationalizing any industries or banks and have even sold some state-owned firms to private interests . Moreover , Spaniards accept the government 's promise that modernization and membership in the European Community , which Spain joined in January , will mean future prosperity . <P> But perhaps Gonzalez 's greatest achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Jean Enkaoua , special correspondent of the French daily Le Dauphine Libere : " Spanish elections are no longer the stuff of passion and risk . "
