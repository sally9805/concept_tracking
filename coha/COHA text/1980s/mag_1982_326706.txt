Banks go after money funds <P> Bankers and savings and loan officers have long cast envious eyes at money-market mutual funds . Reason : the lofty interest that the funds pay , which currently averages about 9% , has attracted some $230 billion in cash . But federal guidelines announced last week will allow banks and thrifts to challenge the funds on an equal footing beginning Dec. 14 . The new rules permit the institutions to offer money-market accounts of their own without any interest ceiling . <P> The new investments will have a large competitive plus but also several minuses . On the positive side , the accounts will be federally insured for up to $100,000 . Money-market mutual funds , by contrast , carry no federal insurance . But bank and thrift customers will have to keep at least $2,500 in their high-yield deposits to avoid a penalty , while the funds typically require no more than $1,000 . Savers also will be allowed to draw just three checks a month on the new accounts . Most money funds offer unlimited checking privileges . <P> Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates have been falling . The Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate to 9% last week , for example , the lowest level since November 1978 . <P> Some industry observers warn that the money-market accounts could do the ailing S and L industry more harm than good . They fear that customers may simply roll much of the $90 billion still in 5% passbook deposits into the new investments . That would sharply drive up the thrifts ' costs without bringing them more money .
