A push for conventional weapons <P> From the very beginning of the cold war , Western military planners have been preoccupied by a single goal in case of war : keeping columns of Soviet tanks and troops from reaching the heart of Europe . When the U.S. held a decisive nuclear edge , NATO threats to use battlefield nukes against the Warsaw Pact 's numerically superior armies were a very effective deterrent . But the Soviets continued to strengthen both their nuclear and their conventional forces . As a result , Europeans began to be concerned that the U.S. would not use its nuclear arms to defend the Continent , for fear of provoking a Soviet counterattack against American cities . Last week , after 18 months of research , 27 prominent U.S. and European defense specialists issued the 260-page Report of the European Security Study , which attempts to rethink NATO strategy in the light of the Soviet buildup. * Their conclusion : the alliance must increase both the quality and the quantity of its conventional forces in Europe . <P> The notion that NATO should rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not new . NATO Commander Bernard W. Rogers has been conducting a virtual one-man crusade to encourage alliance members to strengthen their conventional forces . Among prominent Europeans who agree with Rogers : West German Defense Minister Manfred Worner . Last week U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Richard DeLauer gave the Reagan Administration 's stamp of approval to the European Security Study 's report . Said he : " We support it 100% . " <P> The report acknowledges European fears that a nuclear exchange on the battlefield could not be limited and would quickly turn into a continent-wide holocaust . It suggests that a buildup of conventional forces is a credible alternative because it would provide NATO commanders with a greater range of options for checking a Soviet advance , thus making the use of nuclear weapons less likely . To repel the first invasion forces in a Warsaw Pact blitzkrieg across Central Europe , the committee of strategists urged NATO to acquire more sophisticated ground-and air-launched conventional missile systems that could be targeted at Soviet bloc artillery . The alliance should also develop new surveillance technology that would greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be prepared to cripple enemy airpower by a massive counterattack on Warsaw Pact airbases . To check the enemy 's second wave , Western forces would have to destroy logistic chokepoints such as bridges and ammunition depots . These goals would be supplemented by efforts to disrupt Warsaw Pact communications electronically and to defend NATO command centers from comparable enemy efforts . <P> The report urges alliance members to exploit the latest technology in carrying out this strategy . The type of innovations the contributors have in mind : clusters of bombs that are drawn to a target by the heat that it emits , and new airborne surveillance systems that can instantaneously transmit information and even television pictures of troop movements to commanders in the field .
