" He wakes me up in the middle of the night . . . He don ' t let me sleep ! . . . I been plenty of other places . They always let me sleep . It ' s the same the whole world over . Except here. "  --  Speech by Davies to Mick in Harold Pinter ' s " The Caretaker " Sleep is as far away from actor Alan Wilder each night after he ' s finished playing Davies in " The Caretaker " ( Steppenwolf Theatre ) as it is for the character he plays . " I ' m drained and exhausted after the show , " he says , describing himself as too tired to sleep . Sleep doesn ' t come easily to Maggie LaMee either , each night when she finishes playing Rhetta Cupp in " Pump Boys and Dinettes " ( Apollo Theater Center ) . " I ' m so energized , I ' m on an emotional high after the show , " she says . " I ' m too excited to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every actor experiences after a performance . The reason is the distance  --  emotional and physical  --  that an actor travels each time the curtain goes up in order to give himself to the part he or she plays . Both LaMee and Wilder , like all working stage actors , travel quite a distance the eight times or so a week when they transform themselves into their characters . LaMee is a private , judicious , sophisticated young woman  --  very different from the brash , stick-out-your-chest , sashay-yourself- across-the-stage character she plays nightly . And Wilder , only 32 years old , is thoughtful , refined and soft-spoken  --  a far distance in time and temperament from the 56-or-so-year-old character he plays , someone who is nervous , suspicious and terrified . For LaMee , who has been playing Rhetta Cupp on and off for 1/2 years , the nightly transformation begins only an hour before the show . For Wilder , who has been playing Davies only nine weeks , it begins three hours before first curtain when he goes through a certain kind of emptying-out ritual that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays Henry in " The Real Thing " ( reopening Nov. 22 at Briar Street Theatre ) , describes this emptying-out ritual in terms of himself : " I arrive at the theater early , then I go to my dressing room and stay there ; I just sort of hang out there and work on getting my mind clear of the day . After this , I concentrate on the makeup and get into costume . I stay real quiet . I stay unengaged emotionally  --  you have to  --  no matter whether I talk to the other actors or not . " Although this ritual transition to character must be traversed anew each night , the major roadblocks  --  the memorizing of lines ; the working out the background details of the character ; the blocking in of onstage relationships ; the beats , reactions and physical movements and stage directions  --  have been worked out the same way the nightly transformation into the character has been semi-ritualized . Given the weeks of preparation before the show opens , the hours of concentration before the first curtain and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character but assumes it in a fresh and newborn way each performance , the question becomes not how an actor assumes a role but how he discards it after the show . The movie " A Double Life " addresses this : Actor Anthony John ( played by Ronald Colman ) finds himself unable to turn off the Othello role he plays nightly and ends up , like Othello in the last act , murdering his love . But the transition back to reality is actually much easier than " A Double Life " suggests , although it ' s not total . Wilder admits to some crossover from stage reality to the here and now : " The movements I make  --  just the physical movements of this older person I play and the emotional states he assumes  --  these make me tense muscularly . After a show , I ' m still tense . In fact , I often need a massage right after the show . " Emotionally , Wilder feels relief after last curtain , " relief and a sense of accomplishment , or , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But basically , what I feel is just emptied  --  all spilled out . " But you probably know all this . Perhaps you ' ve gone to the theater for years , sometimes going backstage afterwards . Perhaps you ' ve seen movie scenes  --  lots of them  --  where players begin coming back down to tiresome reality in their dressing rooms after a performance . Some , like LaMee , " cool out " in a T-shirt for a few minutes before leaving the theater . Others , like actor Scott Dainton who plays Munkustrap in " Cats " ( Shubert Theatre ) , find theater space so oppressive after a show that they hurriedly take off makeup and costume before high-tailing it out of the theater . " I get out fast , " he says . " Doing the show is a totally draining experience . When it ' s over , all I want to do is go home . " But he doesn ' t even try to sleep . " No actor could walk off the stage and go right to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have quite a range of activities they pursue en route to winding down , including the at-home activities common to all of us . Dainton , for example , usually doesn ' t join the many " Cats " cast members who cross the street to eat at the City Tavern after the show . Instead , he goes home to have a glass of wine , some pasta and some chicken ( or something else he roasted earlier ) , and to watch David Letterman and the news before going to bed . " We sometimes have planned activities , " Dainton says . " On Wednesday nights , after the show , we have a ' Dynasty ' party . Ten or 12 of us go to our conductor ' s house  --  his name is Tom Helm  --  to watch ' Dynasty . ' He tapes it earlier in the evening . It comes on at 8 p. m. , just when our curtain is going up . " Darlow has a different after show-ritual , dictated by his other commitments . " Within five minutes I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that Henry is a lighter role . " Don ' t get the idea that it ' s easy to play him , though ; it ' s not . But the transition after the show is easier than it was when I was playing a part like Hamlet and was totally fatigued , emotionally and physically . Sometimes after the show I might go , along with the rest of the cast , to Joel ' s for a drink or something to eat ; or we might occasionally go to the Belden Deli for a corned beef sandwich . But not all the time . I run an acting school , called the Actor ' s Institute , in Rogers Park , and I like to get home as early as I can so I can take a look at the material we ' re going to be handling in class next morning . " Says LaMee , after her " cooling out " : " Sometimes we go , as a cast and with the crew members , too , to a local bar called Irish Eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Marigold Arcade . In the summer , we sometimes played softball after the show on Friday nights . There was a real park with a little baseball diamond right behind our theater and it had lights . We used to call and reserve it . That was a good way to come down . But often I find myself wanting to come home and read . I ' ll make a salad then go through this big old stack of books that I ' m trying to get ahead on . Or I might have a cup of herbal tea and watch a movie that I ' ve rented . " Wilder finds himself very " up " after the show with his heart pounding too fast to just go to sleep . " Often I go to the Gaslight Corner , which is a major actor ' s hangout , " he says . " My girl works at the theater ; and we ' ll generally have something to eat and drink . The Gaslight is close by . Proximity . This is because I ' m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it ' s a funny thing about this kind ( after-the-show ) of exhaustion . It ' s weird . You ' re tired , so tired , overtired . But you can ' t fall asleep . You just can ' t . First you have to wind down . " YEAR OF THE ' PUMP BOYS ' Maggie LaMee ( who appears on this week ' s cover ) and the rest of the cast of " Pump Boys and Dinettes " will have something special to celebrate after the show Friday : It ' s the first anniversary of the first preview performance of " Pump Boys " at the Apollo Theater Center , 2540 N. Lincoln Ave . The anniversary party won ' t be until Dec. 6 ( the official opening date was Nov. 27 , 1984 ) , by which time the producers are expecting the show will have grossed an estimated $2. 5 million and played to about 150 , 000 patrons . " I suspect we ' ve broken all box-office records in history for the longest running off-Loop theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers responsible for bringing the show to Chicago . " Certainly , this is the longest running and the most successful show the Apollo has ever produced . " Why is the show so successful ? " It ' s upbeat , it ' s fun , it ' s accessible to people , " Cullen said . " I had such a good time when I saw it in New York that I called the other two producers and suggested that they see it . They did . And they loved it , too , so we decided to produce it here . But the Chicago production is much different from the New York production . The set , the musical arrangements were both designed for Chicago . Besides this , we improved the musical arrangements and the script .
