Months before his visit to Africa last week , Chief of Correspondents Henry Muller filed a request for an interview with Ethiopian Leader Mengistu Haile Mariam . Success seemed unlikely . Mengistu has been largely inaccessible to the Western press in the dozen years since he and fellow military officers overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie . Muller had reason to hope he might be an exception . Eighteen years earlier , he and his wife Maggie McComas , now an associate editor at FORTUNE , had gone to Ethiopia to teach school as Peace Corps volunteers . Just as Muller was about to embark , word was passed along from Addis Ababa that the interview was on . He quickly rearranged his plans . <P> That ability  --  and willingness  --  to adjust a busy schedule comes easily to Muller , a former Paris bureau chief and senior editor of the World section who took over as chief of correspondents and assistant managing editor last February . Not only had Mengistu agreed to the exclusive interview that appears in this week 's issue but the government also placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which included Nairobi Bureau Chief James Wilde and Photographer William Campbell . They were given a glimpse of Ethiopia rarely seen by Western journalists . On a side trip to Holeta ( pop . 3,000 ) , 27 miles west of Addis Ababa , Muller met the current headmaster of one of his old schools . Reports Muller : " We were best remembered , apparently , for having brought the school a duplicating machine . " <P> Muller 's Peace Corps experience did not contribute to a rapport with Mengistu , though . " I mentioned that I had found it moving to revisit the village in which I had taught and in which Mengistu had been educated , " reports Muller . " The remark evoked no response , not the thinnest smile of recognition . " <P> After that session , Muller flew on to South Africa to see at first hand the crisis that has intensified pressure in the West to impose broad sanctions  --  the subject of this week 's cover stories . He had a long meeting with Louis Nel , South Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press restrictions . The month-old rules have complicated the work of Johannesburg Bureau Chief Bruce Nelan and Reporter Peter Hawthorne , but Muller left determined " that TIME continue to be able to provide its readers with honest , fair and accurate reporting from South Africa .
