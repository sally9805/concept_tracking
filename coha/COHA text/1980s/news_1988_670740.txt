Hordes of power brokers have escaped to the Caribbean , and for all those left behind , the last two weeks of the year offer a kind of general amnesty . In a city of workaholics , even the most devoted and ambitious employees have been disappearing for three-hour lunches and midafternoon movie dates .

Ehrenhalt , the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , said he is certain that productivity is plummeting. // " This is the great interregnum , " Mr. Ehrenhalt said . " It ' s time out from ambition . You ' re not going to get ahead these two weeks . I can ' t get anyone on the telephone . They ' re all on vacation.

But Mr. Stern has been displaying his own form of excessive high spirits by taking calls on his special duck telephone . The phone , in the shape of a decoy , quacks into the caller ' s ear when Mr. Stern picks it up . Mr. Stern collects artificial ducks. // " People are bringing in all sorts of Christmas gifts , " he said . " The question is whether they ' re deducktable. " // Some people take to decadence more easily than others . Peggy Rosen , who works in public relations , has been walking around her office barefoot , eating chocolate with enormous concentration. // " I eat whatever comes into the office , " said Ms. Rosen , who for 50 weeks of the year maintains her 115-pound weight by subsisting on salads and mineral water .

Mr. Schwartz , the popular disk jockey and author , stays thin by sticking to such healthy fare as broiled fish and steamed artichokes - and avoiding his great love , Fifth Avenue bars. // " I limit myself to between four and six Fifth Avenue bars a year , " he said .

Mr. London , a former chef at Gracie Mansion , told his date he would be back and headed for the Four Seasons. // " The waiter said they had risotto with white truffles , " Mr. London said . " I said , ' The opera can wait . ' " The risotto took 40 minutes to cook , and it was not until 11 : 10 that Mr. London returned to his seat at the opera .
