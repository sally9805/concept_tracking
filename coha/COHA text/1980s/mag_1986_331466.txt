As she prepared for bed during an overnight stay with her boyfriend 's family in Yonkers , N.Y. , last week , Diane Elsroth , 23 , complained of feeling ill . Her solicitous companion , Michael Notarnicola , also 23 , brought her two capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol from what he said was a previously unopened bottle purchased a week earlier by his mother . Twelve hours later , the stenographer , daughter of a New York State trooper , was found dead of what was later diagnosed as acute cyanide poisoning . Her death touched off a new scare , reminiscent of the still unsolved Tylenol panic of 1982 , in which seven people in the Chicago area died after taking tainted capsules . Once again the capsule form of the leading nonprescription pain-relief medicine in the U.S. was stripped from store shelves across the nation as Tylenol 's manufacturer , Johnson &; Johnson , offered a $100,000 reward for help in tracking down what seemed to be a random killer . Said Company Chairman James Burke : " This is an act of terrorism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tampering as a local incident . The cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules were traced to an A &; P supermarket in Bronxville , a well-to-do bedroom community ( pop . 6,000 ) adjacent to Yonkers . Officials ordered Tylenol capsules removed from all stores in the area for examination . <P> Detectives quickly excluded the Notarnicola family as suspects . In nearby New Rochelle , Secret Service agents arresting three suspects for credit-card fraud inadvertently discovered a letter threatening further poisonings unless the three were paid $2 million . Investigators believed the note was a fraud , an attempt to cash in on a tragic situation , as happened after the Chicago killings , when Con Man James W. Lewis went to prison for ten years for sending a $1 million extortion note to Johnson &; Johnson . <P> Since the poisoned painkiller had been enclosed within Tylenol 's three tamper-resistant seals , investigators turned their attention to the plant in Fort Washington , Pa. , where they were manufactured by a Johnson &; Johnson subsidiary , McNeil Consumer Products . The poison , with a different chemical makeup from the cyanide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cyanide stored at the plant for testing . The company also began a review of its storage and distribution facilities and personnel files of about 30,000 U.S. employees . <P> Concern widened five days after Elsroth 's death , when five more cyanide capsules were found in a Tylenol bottle taken from a Woolworth store just two blocks from the Bronxville A &; P. The second group of contaminated capsules contained the same chemical " fingerprint " as was found in the bottle opened for Elsroth . And as with that deadly container , the tamper-resistant seals on the second bottle appeared untouched . Some of the capsules inside , however , had been opened and reclosed . This bottle , from a different lot , had been filled at a McNeil plant in Puerto Rico .
