However , she acknowledged , it could pick up when the aliens realize that the waiting period is one month. // Most of the refugees said it was worth waiting for a hearing . Despite the delay , Ms. Blain said , the Canadians have not denied anyone here a hearing . <> <> In Salvation Army Building // Local officials have not decided whether to ask Governor Cuomo to declare their town a disaster area , according to Ms. Pandozy . The officials , she added , are uncertain whether the refugees could be considered a disaster problem and whether such a designation would create bureaucratic problems. // Up to now , the officials - from government , social agencies and church groups - are caught up in a series of meetings and seem to be containing the crisis. // The crisis center , at 29 Protection Avenue , is more accustomed to handling suicide-prevention calls than refugees .

But , he pointed out , immigration laws prohibit the refugees from working. // So far , the refugees have not ventured far from their shelter , and most townspeople have yet to encounter their temporary guests. // At the Salvation Army , the chapel looks more like a park these days , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children playing on the expanse of blue carpet , and women trying to sort clothes from suitcases stuffed to capacity . <> <> ' We Need Work ' // Capt . Jack Holcomb , who runs the shelter , said the only problem had been with the heat .

Ms. Funes had been working in Los Angeles as a live-in housekeeper for three years and decided to leave for Canada after her husband and brother had lost their jobs. // " We need to work and send money to my family , " Ms. Funes said .
