The soldiers picked up seven of them , one a child , shot them in the head and left them near the Cuyuapa River , according to survivors . The troops then moved on , the peasants said , to the nearby village of Agua Santa . There , eight young men who were walking through the cane fields on their way to work were seized , taken to the same spot along the river , and shot in the head for being suspected subversives. // The villagers told their story today to Cristobal Aleman , a member of the Government ' s Human Rights Commission , who had come to this western province to investigate . The speed with which the investigation was begun was unusual for El Salvador . The Government was the first organization to order an investigation of the reported massacre. // It is unclear if Mr. Aleman ' s investigation will lead to disciplinary actions against the army or its local commander , though a Salvadoran official said the Government was interested in pursuing the case . And it is viewed as encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report the attack. // Mr. Aleman , who is a coordinator in the peasants ' union , had heard that 74 peasants had been killed . However , no mass grave or other conclusive evidence could be found to indicate that a massacre of that dimension had occurred . Today Mr. Aleman and two reporters who accompanied him on his investigation were told by family members and local authorities that 18 peasants had been killed . The names of the 15 from Las Hojas and Agua Santa and of a 16th from a neighboring village were collected . Two bodies found along the river could not be identified. // While abuses by El Salvador ' s military are often discussed , they appear to have declined recently and it is fairly rare to find as many as 18 people killed . The events of last Tuesday are also unusual because the province of Sonsonate has been relatively shielded from the fighting in the three-year-old civil war and it is not a place where guerrilla sympathizers are thought to be plentiful. // The story the villagers told Mr. Aleman illustrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing is used to settle property disagreements and personal scores . One local leader said today that he believed members of his cooperative had been killed because they had refused a local landowner ' s request to build a road through their land and that their names had been turned over as " subversives " to the military. // Mr. Aleman realizes it will be difficult to punish any soldiers responsible for the murder of the 18 peasants . " Even I am afraid to be investigating this , even though I have the authority of the Minister of Defense , " he said. // The incident has enraged local farmers , who blame the army and United States military aid for disrupting their lives and for the deaths of their friends . " It pains us that the United States is providing aid that does not get to us but instead comes to destroy us , " said Refugio Sanchez , a member of the Las Hojas cooperative . " If they truly respect human rights why do they pay to kill us . " <> <> Bodies Found Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indigenous Salvadorans , a Sonsonate-based countrywide organization with 15 , 000 members , said he first heard about the slayings at 7 : 30 on Tuesday morning from villagers who came to Sonsonate town - the province and the capital have the same name - to go to the market. // Mr. Esquina said he immediately called the commander at the army base in Sonsonate , where 10 American advisers are training soldiers . The commander , Col. Elmer Gonzalez Arraujo , told him he had no information. // Mr. Esquina then drove to Las Hojas where he found the bodies of his friends from the cooperative , ranging from a man of 76 years to a young child , lying along the river with their hands tied behind their backs . He arranged for the bodies to be carried to the cooperative ' s office and laid in coffins on the porch. // Later in the day , when he visited Colonel Gonzalez , the colonel , he said , warned him , " You better watch out , they are after you . " <> <> Meeting With the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooperative went to San Salvador where they were able to meet with the provisional President , Alvaro Magana , and the Minister of Defense , Jose Guillermo Garcia . From that meeting they extracted a promise that Salvador ' s six-month-old Human Rights Commission would investigate the matter. // On Saturday , with a light rain falling , and the farmland smelling sweet with sugar cane , Mr. Aleman came to Sonsonate and traced the reported path of the troops. // The villages are about two miles from the provincial capital in a sparsely populated area that can be reached only on foot . The peasants , who live in one-room thatched huts , are suspicious of outsiders and afraid to talk about anything that may bring trouble. // The 1932 military massacre of thousands of peasants in El Salvador began in Sonsonate and ever since politicians from all parties except the far-right National Republican Alliance have found it a difficult place to organize supporters . <> <> ' Everyone Is Afraid Here ' // " Everyone is afraid here , " Mr. Aleman said after patiently trying to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river where the bodies were found. // " They have problems over there , but here there are none , " the woman said . While she was willing to serve her visitors watermelon and mangoes , she was reluctant to talk about slayings that occurred less than a quarter of a mile from her hut // In a walk along the river , a member of the cooperative showed Mr. Aleman where the bodies had been found . Dried leaves and old bricks from a crumbling structure were caked with blood , but the bodies had already been carried to the cooperative ' s office and buried nearby. // Mr. Aleman moved on to Agua Santa , a small village of fewer than 25 huts filled with listless looking peasants and naked children . <> <> Widows Tell Their Story // There , a group of women , looking more like young high school girls than widows , related how their husbands had been killed while walking to work to cut sugar cane on Tuesday in a massacre that left 20 orphans. // Five of the eight men slain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides security to places where the army does not have men on guard . Ten of the families in Agua Santa , the villagers said , had moved there to escape the constant battles between guerrillas and Government troops in Chalatenango , to the northeast. // " We do not have political ideas , we just came here to work , " said Amina Ayala , one of the young widows . They had no explanation of why their husbands had been killed and suggested that the investigators ride out to a hut behind the sugar fields and talk to one of the commanders of the local civil defense patrol . <> <> Killings Called ' Local Problem ' // Hernan Caceres , the second in command of the local defense group , was 25 feet up a coconut tree , cutting down fruit , when his visitors arrived . He shimmied down and asked what they wanted . Avoiding their eyes , and hacking away at a dried piece of bark , he said he had only heard talk of the killings and knew nothing himself. // In San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s top aide , said he believed the killings in Las Hojas had been directed by the local civil defense commander in what he characterized as a " local problem . " Mr. Guerrero said he was unaware of the killings in Aqua Santa. // Mr. Esquina believes the members of his cooperative were killed because the local landowner , whose request to build a road across their proprety had been denied , had friends in the army and probably identified the farmers as subversives. // Mr. Esquina said that when he visited Colonel Gonzalez , who commands all army troops in Sonsonate province , on Friday , the colonel said the murdered farmers were on a list of subversives . He then was reported to have asked Mr. Esquina for the names of the 42 families in his cooperative so they could work together to wipe out subversion . Colonel Gonzalez , who could not be reached for comment , did not give him a list of the subversives. // " I told him that if he showed that one of my men was a subversive , I would die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
