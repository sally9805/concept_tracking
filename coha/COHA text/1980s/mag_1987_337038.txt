Early on the day Arthur Christ Agnos was elected the 37th mayor of San Francisco , a violent storm unexpectedly swept across the city , dumping hail , downing power lines , flooding streets . For a brief time chaos reigned . But shortly after the polls closed in last week 's runoff election , it was apparent that a bigger gale had been spawned by Agnos himself . The candidate , once a little-known state assemblyman , blew away John Molinari , president of San Francisco 's board of supervisors , with an overwhelming 70% of the vote . A voluble former social worker who arrived in San Francisco from Springfield , Mass. , in 1966 , Agnos , 49 , becomes the first non-native to run the city in 40 years . Ever mindful of his outsider 's background , Agnos declares , " The center of power in this town has shifted . " <P> That shift came dramatically and unexpectedly . The representative of the city 's unfashionable eastern district for more than a decade , Agnos badly trailed Front Runner Molinari in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor television-debate performance hurt Molinari . Agnos ' superb grass-roots organization , as well as his advocacy of rent controls and affordable housing , turned the campaign around . Agnos nearly outpolled all ten other candidates in November 's general election to set up last week 's landslide . <P> Whether Agnos will build on his success depends on his ability to respond to some daunting challenges .

" But our study showed that the money was going to Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bit of resignation : " Los Angeles has 15 million people . We have six million . " <P> To be accurate , San Francisco has only 725,000 residents . But the images of cable cars climbing past high-rises , a densely settled Chinatown and a skyline packed tightly into a nest of hills suggest a metropolis of greater heft . In recent years , however , the city 's problems have fallen into sharper and more painful focus . <P> Even before Feinstein became mayor in November 1978 , following the city hall murders of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk , San Francisco and its environs had developed a reputation that would give heartburn to a Chamber of Commerce . First there was the 1967 Summer of Love , with its easy exchange of drugs and sex in Haight-Ashbury . Then in 1973 came the racially motivated Zebra killings ; Agnos , who was seriously wounded after leaving a neighborhood political meeting , was one of the gunman 's 18 randomly chosen victims . Next followed the kidnaping of Newspaper Heiress Patty Hearst and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Jones had moved his cult followers from a " people 's temple " in the center of San Francisco .
