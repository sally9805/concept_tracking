By the age of two , the Baltimore youngster was putting together 1,000-piece puzzles . Two years later he almost became a nursery-school dropout .

The debate over how to teach gifted children ? generally considered the top 5 percent of students ? has intensified in the last few years with more and more parents , educators and even politicians talking about the dangers of wasting untapped brainpower and creativity . " To compete , we have to develop the best of our fine young folks , " says New York Rep. Mario Biaggi who , along with Sen.

" Experts say it 's important for parents to be honest and open with their children so problems can be shared . Parents have to walk a fine line between pushing a child to do his best and asking too much . Daydreaming is as important as music lessons . " We make an effort to talk to the parents about letting kids play , " says Chevy Martin , director of research and development at the Nueva Learning Center in Hillsborough , Calif. , a school for gifted children .

The school issue is another difficult one for parents . Many educators do agree that smart kids need some kind of special attention . " If they are completely bored , if they 're not challenged , they can become developmentally lazy , " says Mills . But others are concerned about the longterm effects of segregating bright children from their peers . Youngsters who are labeled gifted at an early age may grow up with unrealistic expectations about their future , says Joyce Van Tassel-Baska , director of the Center of Talent Development at Northwestern University . " It 's tragic when I see kids who thought that because they . . . have a high IQ score , that automatically guarantees that something will happen to them in life .

In some cities , the word gifted has become something of a marketing ploy . Programs for gifted children may attract middle-class families back into the public-school system . In other parts of the country , the standard for judging giftedness is a political hot potato ? with some ethnic groups charging that IQ tests are culturally biased in favor of middle-class whites . In most schools in California , for example , administrators are not allowed to use intelligence tests to determine giftedness .

Educators say that IQ tests are not always reliable when administered to very young children . While a high score is usually a sign that the child is pretty smart , a low score can be meaningless . The child may have been scared of the person administering the test or may just have been having a bad day . As a result , many schools rely on a variety of indicators of ability . So how do you tell if your child is gifted ? Many teachers who work with gifted children advise parents to " trust their instincts . " Although some mothers and fathers may overestimate their youngsters ' abilities , James Borland , codirector of the Center for the Study and Education of the Gifted at Columbia University Teachers College , says parents are usually accurate because they know their children better than anyone .
