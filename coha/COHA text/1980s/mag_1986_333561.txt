Ever since the advent of AIDS , two questions have been haunting Americans . How far and how fast is the incurable and almost invariably fatal disease likely to spread ? And does it pose a threat to the general public  --  that is , the vast majority of people who are neither homosexuals , bisexuals nor intravenous drug users ? <P> Last week a committee of 28 biologists , clinicians , public-health scientists and other experts assembled by the prestigious Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences gave some grim answers . AIDS , according to the panel 's 374-page report , " could become a catastrophe " unless the spread of the killer virus is checked . That will require " perhaps the most wide-ranging and intensive efforts ever made against an infectious disease , " specifically research and education programs that would probably cost $2 billion a year , at the minimum , by 1990 . <P> In addition , said the panel , the number of cases among heterosexuals who do not inject narcotics into their veins , though small at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly no one can predict , but the threat is at least great enough to justify targeting educational campaigns not just at homosexuals and IV drug users , who now account for more than 90% of all AIDS victims , but at everybody . <P> What gave the panel findings extra punch was that they followed by only a week an equally grim report by U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop that urged an all-out effort to educate the populace , beginning with young children , to the dangers of AIDS and ways to avoid them . Though they worked independently , Koop and the NAS committee each knew of the other 's studies . Their reports contained little that had not been published before in the way of scientific information about AIDS or predictions about its spread . What distinguished them from previous pronouncements was the authority of their authors ( the National Academy of Sciences was chartered by Congress in 1863 as a private body to give advice to the Federal Government ) , their uncompromisingly blunt language and the urgent tone of their recommendations . Said David Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference : " This is a national health crisis . . . We are quite honestly frightened about the prospects . " <P> Just what are those prospects ? The panel endorsed five-year projections that were made by the Public Health Service last summer . Key numbers : by the end of this year , 35,000 people will have developed AIDS , and 18,000 of them will have died . By the end of 1991 , those numbers will multiply to 270,000 cases and 179,000 deaths  --  74,000 new cases and 54,000 deaths during 1991 alone , costing between $8 billion and $16 billion annually in health care . Unhappily , these numbers are not mere guesswork : the vast majority of those who will sicken and die over the next five years already have the AIDS virus in their bodies . An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the U.S. have been infected by HIV ( for human immunodeficiency virus ) , the currently preferred term for the AIDS-causing agent . The academy calculates that at least 25% to 50% of them will develop the actual disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after their disease is first diagnosed .
