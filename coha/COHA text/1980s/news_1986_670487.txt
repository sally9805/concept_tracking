Yet , in fact , 1986 was an improvement over 1985 , in spite of rising production costs that bend the mind . While it was going on , it looked decidely grim . More films were released , for the most part meaning more bad films , everything from " Mountaintop Motel Massacre " and " Girls School Screamers " to big-budget flops like Alan Alda ' s " Sweet Liberty " and Roman Polanski ' s " Pirates. " // If we analyze the year ' s hit movies as if they are our collective , wish-fulfilling dreams , we are a nation of sentimental sadists and birdbrained yahoos , permanently arrested in our 15th year. // Sylvester Stallone , as " Cobra , " shoots up California supermarkets in the name of law-and-order . Tom Cruise , in some admittedly splendid aerial photography , shoots up Russians in dogfights over the Indian Ocean in " Top Gun . " In " The Karate Kid , Part II , " a nice , clean-cut American boy solves all his problems by becoming a high-kicking Eastern mystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals firmly with not one but two questions that probably never even get asked in Russia : Should Molly Ringwald go to the senior prom and , if so , what frock should she wear ? // The year ' s most American film in spirit ( as well as one of the year ' s most popular ) was made by Australians - " Crocodile Dundee. " // However , in retrospect , it ' s now clear that 1986 hasn ' t been so bad after all . Any calendar year that ' s more or less bracketed by the release of Woody Allen ' s " Hannah and Her Sisters " in February and Oliver Stone ' s " Platoon " in December must be a little special. // There also were some exceptionally good documentaries , including Maximilian Schell ' s tough , funny " Marlene , " made with the grudging cooperation of Marlene Dietrich ; Manfred Kirchheimer ' s " We Were So Beloved , " about Jews who escaped from Germany before the Holocaust and settled in Manhattan ' s Washington Heights , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost as much about the Great Depression as it is about the Mississippi " Kingfish. " // A wacky standout : Ross McElwee ' s " Sherman ' s March , " the film maker ' s meditation on " the possibility of romantic love in the South today , " though he ' s often sidetracked by other kinds of love that bump into him on Southern sidewalks as he follows the trail of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman , to the sea and up the coast. // Federico Fellini ' s " Fred and Ginger " was a disappointment , partially because all Fellini films are expected to match his masterpieces . Jonathan Demme ' s " Something Wild " doesn ' t rank with his " Melvin and Howard " and " Handle With Care , " but it ' s still the work of one of our most exuberantly American directors. // Deserving much more serious attention than it received from the public and the critics was Penelope Spheeris ' s " Boys Next Door , " a remarkably terse , beady-eyed tale of a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles into a three-day murder spree . It also features an excellent performance by Charlie Sheen , Martin ' s boy , who becomes a star in " Platoon " ( see below ) . // The year should not be wrapped up without mention of several other films that made 1986 far more rewarding than it appeared to be at the time . I ' m thinking of Edgar Reitz ' s 16-hour " Heimat , " a chronicle of life in Germany from 1919 to 1982 and , really , a television mini-series , though shown here at the Public Theater ; Spike Lee ' s comedy , " She ' s Got ta Have It " and the very English ( screenplay by Harold Pinter ) " Turtle Diary , " with its elegantly funny performances by Glenda Jackson , Ben Kingsley and Michael Gambon. // All things considered - and allowing for biases that are indefensible - the 10 best films of 1986 are , in alphabetical order : // " Blue Velvet . " On the basis of this arresting , scary comedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Small Town , U.S.A. , I ' m now convinced that David Lynch ( " Eraserhead , " " Elephant Man " and " Dune " ) is a blood-brother of John Waters ( " Pink Flamingos " ) , only Mr. Lynch has complete command of his style and minds his manners a bit more . Both men are subversive humorists. // " Blue Velvet " is a revivifying example of the kind of idiosyncratic film making that sometimes - miraculously - is allowed to assert itself in the me-too world of commercial movie making . Beginning with the discovery of a human ear in a vacant lot in the otherwise spotlessly clean little city of Lumberton , the film goes on to weave its magic spell ( accompanied by the title song ) of moral , physical and fiscal corruption . The screenplay , written by Mr. Lynch , involves a masochistic , down-on-her-id singer ( Isabella Rossellini ) , her homicidal lover ( Dennis Hopper ) and the two kids next door , played by Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern ( see " Smooth Talk " below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A crazy , all-American classic. // " The Color of Money . " Taking off from " The Hustler , " Robert Rossen ' s shapely , 1961 melodrama about the rise and fall of a pool hustler named Fast Eddie Felson ( Paul Newman ) , Martin Scorsese , the director , Richard Price , who wrote the screenplay , and Mr. Newman , who plays Fast Eddie 25 years later , have created a stunning comedy of character that stands on its own. // The film , about the aging Fast Eddie ' s attempts to make a pool star of a young hustler much like himself 25 years ago , has a lot of the laconic wit and ease that distinguished Hollywood movies in their pre-World War II Golden Age . Tom Cruise is very good as the nervy kid , and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is a bright , brand-new film personality as the kid ' s sharp-as-nails girlfriend . The film , however , belongs to Mr. Newman . He gives a rich , effortlessly commanding , funny performance that both caps a career and leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scorsese ' s fast-paced , neon-colored vision. // " Down by Law . " " Stranger Than Paradise , " Jim Jarmusch ' s bleakly comic , 1984 fable , was not a fluke . This is triumphantly proved by " Down by Law , " Mr. Jarmusch ' s far less bleak but no less eccentric comedy about three misfits ( a second-rate pimp , an out-of-work disk jockey and a Candide-like Italian tourist ) fleeing the Louisiana police . Heading the excellent cast : Tom Waits , Tom Lurie ( from " Stranger Than Paradise " ) , Roberto Benigni and Ellen Barkin. // The narrative is most engaging , but it ' s only a small part of what Mr. Jarmusch ' s films are all about . With the help of superior cameramen ( in this case , of Robby Muller ) , Mr. Jarmusch reminds us that the position of the camera , whether it plays an active role or remains passive within a scene , the length of the takes , the lighting - in other words , the ways in which we perceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting or trumped-up storytelling . Mr. Jarmusch makes movies that look like no one else ' s and , because of that , they affect us like no others. // " Down by Law " is by far the most original , most bold , most organically cinematic American film of the year . With the exception of the films in this list , it makes most other films look as stilted as slide shows featuring vacation snaps. // " Hannah and Her Sisters . " This is the chef d ' oeuvre of the Woody Allen career to date , a dramatic comedy about three spirited , loving , often wrongheaded , quintessentially bourgeois Manhattan sisters , played with singular skill by Mia Farrow , Dianne Wiest and Barbara Hershey . " Hannah " is another extraordinary Allen original . Though it evokes Chekhov , the master-of-theater whom the film maker most admires , it does so in Mr. Allen ' s own , utterly contemporary terms , and through his own profoundly moving sensibility. // Like Chekhov , Mr. Allen discovers a muted kind of glory in characters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolation by being so easily defined . The splendid cast also includes Mr. Allen , Michael Caine , Max Von Sydow , Carrie Fisher , Daniel Stern , and , in a class by themselves , Maureen O ' Sullivan and the late Lloyd Nolan. // " Menage . " Betrand Blier ' s priceless French farce about a bruiser of an ex-con ( Gerard Depardieu ) , an expert at breaking and entering , who destroys the marrriage of a pair of engaging misfits . They are played by Michel Blanc and Miou-Miou , who somehow manage to adapt to the situation when Mr. Depardieu falls heedlessly in love with - and successfully seduces - the uptight little husband. // The film can be profitably analyzed , I suppose , but first it should be experienced just for all of its manic , upside-down humor and for Mr. Depardieu ' s extraordinary performance . " Menage " is the most accomplished comedy yet made by Mr. Blier ( " Going Places , " " Get Out Your Handkerchiefs " ) , and he gives free rein to Mr. Depardieu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing as ( but much funnier than ) watching a hippo tap-dance on stilts. // " My Beautiful Laundrette . " Written by Hanif Kureishi and directed by Stephen Frears , this was the most surprising , most satisfying hit of the year - a brilliant , cutting social comedy about exiled Pakistanis , making their way out of the London slums , and about some of the poor English who get in their way . It ' s also two sorrowful love stories , one of which is homosexual but doesn ' t bother to speak its name . It ' s self-evident. // The film is candid , wise and immensely entertaining . The fine cast features Saeed Jaffrey as a money-loving businessman , Gordon Warnecke as his quick-to-learn nephew , and Daniel Day Lewis ( see " A Room With a View " below ) , in the year ' s most expert performance by a young actor , as the Cockney tough who makes the romantic mistake of falling in love with Mr. Wrong. // " Platoon . " Oliver Stone has done some flashy work before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Scarface " and both the direction of and the screenplay for " Salvador " ; but " Platoon " is something else entirely - one of the best films yet made about the fighting in Vietnam . It could be the best . The film ' s focus is short . It recalls the Vietnam War through the experiences of a single platoon of exhausted , amazingly resilient infantrymen , characterized almost entirely through their daily grinds , which are alternately deadly boring and just deadly. // Though it has a lot of worrying , moving things on its mind , " Platoon " contains no overt political messages . It ' s pragmatic , like its soldiers . Instead of messages , it dramatizes what fighting this war must have been like to those who weren ' t thinking about issues , only about making it back to base - day after day . Charlie Sheen plays the central role - beautifully - with excellent support from Willem Dafoe , Tom Berenger , Kevin Dillon and Keith David . In a word , smashing. // " A Room With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ismail Merchant , the director James Ivory and the writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala - top their fine adaptation of Henry James ' s " Bostonians " with this even more beautiful and rich adaptation of E. M. Forster ' s comedy of manners , " A Room With a View . " They have transferred Forster ' s novel from page to screen , seemingly intact , with dialogue , characters , settings , even ideas , not only undamaged but illuminated. // Chief among the equals of the splendid cast are Helena Bonham Carter , as the well-bred Edwardian girl who almost ruins her life - and the lives of everyone around her - by marrying the suitable but wrong man , and Maggie Smith , Denholm Elliott , Julian Sands and , in particular , Daniel Day Lewis as an insufferable though winning prig . No " Masterpiece Theater " this . It ' s an adaptation , but it ' s also an original. // " Smooth Talk . " It has the shape of the Joyce Carol Oates short story ( " Where Are You Going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adapted - about a pretty , gangly , sexually questing 15-year-old girl who , one day , happens to attract every mother ' s nightmare , a rude , sexually questing " older " man of 30 or so . What happens to the active but innocent Connie ( Laura Dern ) is probably fatal in the story and almost beside the point of this fascinating film. // In " Smooth Talk , " with the scope that a film automatically imposes on a narrative , Joyce Chopra , the director , and Tom Cole , who wrote the screenplay , tell not only the story of Laura and her menacing stranger ( Treat Williams ) , but also of an America that ' s like one of its formerly grand , Eastern cities . There is no so-called " inner city " in this film . Like Laura ' s family , everybody seems to live in a limbo that ' s not quite urban or exurban . There ' s no center of gravity for the family . Thus , what happens to Laura is a foregone conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with riveting performances by Mr. Williams , who snakes through the film in mirrored glasses , and Miss Dern , who , though tall and physically grown up , still seems to have bits of eggshell in her hair. // " Summer . " Eric Rohmer ' s glowing miniature , a sad , sweet comedy about Delphine ( Marie Riviere ) , a restless , lonely young Parisian woman who ' d probably be hell to know but , as revealed by Mr. Rohmer and Miss Riviere , is a source of continual delight . Delphine is every pretty , anonymous woman one ' s passed on the street and wondered about . She ' s proud , funny and so stubbornly independent that she drives all her friends to painless distraction . Marie ' s problem : where to go on her summer vacation. // Though the problems seem small , they loom large , clear and as melancholic as funny . Mr. Rohmer dramatizes them as if he were a microsurgeon . Real incisions are made but no blood is let . " Summer " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohmer work is. // The 10 runners-up , in no special order of preference , are : // " That ' s Life , " Blake Edwards ' s gaudy but introspective comedy about mortality in Hollywood , starring Julie Andrews and Jack Lemmon , each at the peak of their accumulated talents ; " Decline of the American Empire , " Denys Arcand ' s French-Canadian talkfest about a group of self-absorbed academicians who see the Fall of the West in their own love lives ; Bertrand Tavernier ' s " ' Round Midnight , " a paean to bebop with an amazing , laid-back , bebop performance by the musician Dexter Gordon ; Alain Cavalier ' s " Therese , " a sweet , unphony , radiantly beautiful contemplation of the life of St. Therese of Lisieux ; David Cronenberg ' s striking remake of " The Fly , " with Jeff Goldblum as the soon-to-be-speck on the floor. // Also , the Japanese " Pigs and Battleships , " Shohei Imamura ' s 1961 melodramatic comedy , loaded with armor-piercing satire ; " Ruthless People , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Chief , " with Bette Midler and Danny DeVito , directed by the " Airplane ! " crew , Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker ; Neil Jordan ' s " Mona Lisa , " an eerie romance with superlative performances by Bob Hoskins and Cathy Tyson ; " Uforia , " John Binder ' s oddball , Preston Sturges-like comedy , and Alex Cox ' s " Sid and Nancy , " which takes a blunt look at the romantic lives of the terminally-addicted Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen in a way that probably would have astonished and delighted them. //
