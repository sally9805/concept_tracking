Professional football had excluded blacks from 1933 until Kenny Washington signed with the Los Angeles Rams for the 1946 season . In 1950 Chuck Cooper and Nat ( Sweetwater ) Clifton were signed by the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks , respectively , and became the first black players in the National Basketball Association . <> <> A Period of Dominance // During the 35 years that have passed since Robinson ' s debut , the black athlete has emerged as a dominant figure in most of the major sports . And in accomplishing that success he has helped change each of the sports - how they are played and how they are viewed by a critical , emotional and predominantly white public. // The success of the black athlete on the field is well documented . In baseball 22 of the 24 National and American League stolen-base leaders since 1971 have been black , as have 16 of the last 24 batting champions . Every N.F.L. rushing champion from 1963 has been black . And in the N.B.A. only three white players have led the league in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league in rebounding since 1957. // But how has this success been translated into a force that has changed the games themselves ? According to Hank Aaron , baseball ' s all-time home run champion , it was the black athlete who helped transform baseball from what he called a " one base , one run , and wait-for-the-big-hit " type of game into one which became charged this season by the daring exploits of Rickey Henderson , who established a record with 130 stolen bases . <> <> Robinson Brought Excitement // " I saw what Jackie Robinson did with his stealing of home plate and his daring baserunning , " Aaron says . " He brought excitement to the game . When I was in Milwaukee , we used to play that old , dull game . But with the influx of more talented black athletes , that Jackie Robinson style caught on . White players caught on , and even managers changed their styles to adapt to it and make things happen. " // Jim Brown recalls how the development of " option-blocking " - a style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unique combination of strength and quickness to run anywhere an opening emerged - was viewed as a radical change by football observers when it was developed for him early in his career . " It was strictly against all the coaching techniques that had been employed until then , " he said . " But I had the quickness and strength to pick and choose my holes . Later , the coach started using the flare pass in the flat to allow me to utilize the open field more . Now all of this is basic football. " // It was seven years after Cooper and Clifton began playing in the N.B.A. that the full effect of the black athlete in pro basketball would take hold . That was the year Bill Russell , an intimidating shot-blocker , rebounder , and the creator <> of the vaunted Boston Celtic fast break , joined the N.B.A. In subsequent years , players such as Wilt Chamberlain , Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor would begin their careers . Each brought new talents and styles to the game. // But according to Marques Haynes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought more than such talents as rebounding , quickness , speed and jumping ability to basketball . " He also brought his competitiveness to the game , " he says . " It ' s now more intense , a harder-played game . Some of that individual talent took away from the team concept of the game . I think it ' s taken away too much . " <> <> Basketball Most Creative // Many athletes feel that there has been no other sport where the creativeness of the black athlete is more apparent than in basketball . " It was , and is , a very simple game , " says Julius Erving of the Philadelphia 76ers . " But what the black athlete did was to enhance the game with an expression that was his own , taking the basics to another dimension . Soon the white player began to emulate those thoughts and moves and , eventually , the game became what it is today - a stage where a unique combination of the team concept and individual expression are presented in a pure form. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black athlete has not been immune to racial barriers . Indeed some places , and people , were more reluctant to change than others . At the University of Alabama in 1971 , Wilbur Jackson , a running back , became the first black to play for Paul ( Bear ) Bryant . At the University of Arkansas , Frank Broyles didn ' t have a black player on his football team until 1972 when Jon Richardson became a wide receiver for the Razorbacks . Now there are 54 blacks on the 128-man Alabama roster and 42 on the 104-man Arkansas roster. // Says Broyles : " There could have been serious problems without good level-headed people we had here . And it is now an observable fact that in our part of the country , where we are now using all of the potential of our population , the black athlete has upgraded the quality of football tremendously . And those young men who joined us proved conclusively that they could work academically , and play football , with anybody . They proved that conclusively right away . " <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a performer , the black athlete has had little success in transferring those gains to the front office , where he could perform as a decision-maker. // On the field , things are much different , leading to a number of questions : What has the dominance of the black athlete done to the American psyche ? What new social problems have been created by this dominance ? And most importantly , is the black athlete accepted any more today than Jackie Robinson was nearly four decades ago ? // " As a human being , no , " says Dr. Harry Edwards , the Univeristy of California sociologist . " But we have moved from the ideas of Jim Crow , which dominated the era of Jackie Robinson in the late 40 ' s and 50 ' s , to one which I call the era of James Crow , Esquire . The dynamics involved in channeling the black athlete into sports meant simply that he was more needed . But when it comes to discerning between being needed and being desired , one is walking a very fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-time scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates , told a reporter that the average fan didn ' t want to see a team field nine blacks at the same time . Haak was publicly reprimanded for the remark , but many people , including several black players , said Haak was speaking the truth . " It wasn ' t something that hadn ' t been thought or spoken before , " says Willie Stargell , the Pirate slugger who retired at the end of this season . " It simply touched some nerves . " <> <> Part of 1960 ' s Protests // In the late 1960 ' s , Mr. Edwards was the primary force behind a black power movement that culminated in the protest by two black track stars , Tommie Smith and John Carlos , on the victory podium at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City . Boldly wearing a black glove , the two sprinters raised a fist while bowing their heads during the national anthem . " Black people are getting closer and closer together , " Carlos later told the international news media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people think we ' re just animals to do a job . We saw white people in the stands putting thumbs down at us . We want them to know we ' re not roaches , ants or rats. " // Not only were Smith and Carlos suspended from further participation in the Games by the United States Olympic Committee , but a good portion of white society took their actions as a personal affront. // Dr. Bruce Ogilvie , a retired sports sociologist , calls it " the most misrepresented gesture in all of sports . " He adds : " They were saying : ' My black brothers and sisters be proud . We will overcome . ' But it was the body language that was transmitted to the American people . It was portrayed as an assault on Yankee virtue , motherhood and apple pie , when it was not that at all . ' We are humans of quality , ' they said . ' Not anti-American . ' " <> <> Reversal in Baseball // Today , Mr. Edwards says he believes there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains made by the black athlete . He pointed to baseball , where , he said , since 1971 the percentage of American blacks in the major leagues has decreased from 29 percent in both leagues to 18. 8 percent in the American League and 19. 2 percent in the National League . That decline , he and several baseball officials say , can be attributed , in part , to the fact that about five years ago teams began signing more of their young prospects from the colleges rather than from high schools - a fact that lessens the chance of finding a young black player because few colleges offer scholarships in baseball , which produces little revenue . Most of the black colleges in the South have dropped the sport entirely. // Monte Irvin , who , along with Henry Thompson , integrated the old New York Giants in 1949 and is now a member of the baseball commissioner ' s staff , says : " What scouts have to do , if they are indeed looking for black talent , is to go out West and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go after players they hear about , and sometimes they have to be more patient with them because they don ' t develop as fast as players from a different environment . " <> <> Lack of Quick Stardom // Another factor affecting the number of blacks in baseball is a lack of immediate stardom . While a talented collegiate football or basketball player is likely to make an N.F.L. or N.B.A. team - and even become a star - in his very first season out of college , it is extremely rare for a collegiate baseball player to gain fame on a major-league team without first serving time as a faceless prospect in the minors. // " Football and basketball players get instant publicity even as they move from high school into college and later into the pros , " Irvin says . " Baseball , being as challenging as it is requires seasoning , sometimes for several years . And black players get lost in this. " // In coaching , the opportunities for blacks remain limited . Among the 26 baseball teams , there is only one black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro football there are no black head coaches and never have been . The N.B.A. , long lauded as the most liberal of the pro sports leagues , now has three black coaches among its 23 positions. // In even higher front-office positions , such as general manager or personnel directors , the numbers of blacks are almost negligible. // John Johnson , who was released by the Seattle SuperSonics earlier this week , has been one of the finest passing forwards in basketball during his 12 seasons in the N.B.A. He says management is " very concerned with having someone there to identify with the general public , most of whom are wealthy suburbanites . You don ' t want to alienate these people by constantly pushing black on them. " // That the black athlete began to dominate on the field was , in itself , almost too much for white society to endure , says the Rev. Jesse Jackson , the civil-rights activist and forceful voice of Operation PUSH . Black athletic success - going back to the days of Jack Johnson in the early 1900 ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Great White Hope syndrome. // Johnson gained the world heavyweight boxing title in 1908 , and attained the peak of his controversial career when he knocked out James J. Jeffries , the white former champion who had been brought out of retirement to fight him , on July 4 , 1910 . The victory led to riots . Johnson became even more dominant in the next few years as champion , and more visible outside of it - flaunting his affairs with white women and his marriage to one. // In the book , " Bad Nigger ! The Impact of Jack Johnson , " the author Al-Tony Gilmore writes about Johnson ' s effect on portions of white America : " Generally , they were opposed to the champion and their reasons varied : He was a black fighter who beat white fighters ; his display of courgae and strength in the ring did not fit well with their racial assumptions about blacks and they felt that his publicized life style was not only an insult to the morals and customs of the nation , but one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , to accept as champion was a strain in itself , but to tolerate his intrepid actions outside of the ring was to make a bad situation incredibly worse . " <> <> White Hope Syndrome // Even today , the residue of the Great White Hope syndrome lingers . Witness much of the hysteria that surrounded the promotion of the recent heavyweight title fight between Larry Holmes , the black champion , and Gerry Cooney , the white challenger. // Cooney disdained the Great White Hope label in news story after news story . But as the date of the fight drew nearer , it was constantly forced upon him in news and television reports. // From the time that Holmes entered the ring to a long chorus of boos to the moment that Cooney ' s manager jumped into the ring to save his bloodied fighter 13 rounds later , it was clear that more than a title belt was at stake. // " White people had been programmed to think that a Cooney victory would be an affront to the esteem of black people , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a champion . In the ring they introduce Holmes , the champion , first , then : ' Ladies and gentlemen , in this corner , in the green hood . . . " The Rev. Jackson said Cooney " was a gentleman - he wouldn ' t bite the race bait even though it was all around him. " // " Aggression is the initial focus of the masculine image , " says Mr. Edwards . " And it does not bode well in terms of the white , masculine mystique to see the white man continually beaten out of his socks . In that respect , the black athlete has done a great deal to undermine the continuity of what America believes about itself in terms of the masculine image . " <> <> Search for White Stars // Larry Bird , an exceptionally gifted athlete , has also rejected the " white hope " tag since he entered the N.B.A. in 1979 . But Bird ' s popularity has heightened the belief that without more successful white players , a stable N.B.A. future is uncertain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average between 70 and 75 percent . " There used to be a quota of blacks on a team with eight to 10 white players , " said Elvin Hayes , the veteran forward , who now plays for the Houston Rockets . " But things have changed . Many of the whites were super players - Jerry West , Don Nelson and Bill Bradley . Now not every team has a top-name white player . And it hurts them . You can ' t blame the people . They want someone to cheer for just like we used to. " // Hayes will be 37 next month , and he is likely to tie or surpass as many as six career records before he retires . He has played in 12 consecutive all-star games . " If I was a white player , I could write my own ticket to anything in America , " he says . " There would have been no limit to what I could have done . The endorsements , the appearances , the status , all of it was out of the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // " We are gladiators , " says Jim Brown . " We are expected to perform only physically . That ' s why the quarterback position is so sacred . He was always portrayed as the hero - smarter , stronger and superior to the other players. " // As Arthur Ashe was growing up in Virginia during the late 1950 ' s and early 1960 ' s , he could not register for two of the nation ' s five junior tennis tournaments , which were crucial in determining his national ranking , because he was black . Yet Ashe says there are other reasons why blacks have not excelled at his sport in great numbers . Among them is something he calls the " inner-city mentality. " // " In basketball , primarily played by inner-city kids , ability is honed through a childhood of uninhibited hours on the court , " Ashe says . " That kid may not have the discipline to put in the long hours under supervision required to become good tennis player . " Yet even tennis is starting to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championships in Flushing Meadow , N.Y. , three of the final 16 players in the men ' s division were black. // In 1968 , Ashe became the first black to win the United States Open title and did it on the heels of the Olympic protest . The incident in Mexico City proved to be a fitting highlight to what was a feverish year in black sports history . " It was at least as important as the ' 47 era , " says Mr. Edwards . " That era was an instance of a single individual , Robinson , making a step forward . The ' 68 era was an instance of a culture with an intellectual base making a step. " // " It made white people aware of the black athlete , " says Hayes . " Now , not only does he have ability , but he has the power to change things , thoughts and ideas . And that scared them.
