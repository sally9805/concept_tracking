 | It was a peculiar decade , the ' 80s . Good times for most Americans , a period of peace and prosperity and a sense of tremendous rightness about our place in the world . Bad times for others : a time when avarice got respectable , poverty expanded and wealth became a kind of state religion . Mostly , though , the ' 80s are coming to seem like a dream . Can there really have been a time when Ronald Reagan , Mikhail Gorbachev 's new best friend and high-stakes poker buddy , called the U.S.S.R. " an evil empire " ? When Reagan seemed politically and personally invincible ? When the Dow climbed and climbed and looked like it might never top out ? When it seemed like a $74 billion annual budget deficit was serious business ? When insider trading was winked at , greedy young moneychangers were seen as pop heroes and nothing was more fascinating than the lifestyles of the rich and famous ? Hard to believe . All that seems fuzzy now . Today the United States and U.S.S.R. toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame duck , the sky-high market is back down , Ivan Boesky is sentenced to jail , Yuppie-bashing is a national pastime and a whole industry has sprung up around the practice of staying home and watching TV . The ' 90s are here . Decades are not a function of calendar time . They are trends , values and associations , bundled up and tied together in the national memory . They begin and end in the middle of the night sometime when everyone is looking the other way . They are sometimes scarred by forces beyond our control ? in the case of the ' 80s , tragically @#  | so with AIDS . Very early in the 1980s almost everyone thought the disease was an anomalous outbreak in an isolated community . By now it has moved beyond the homosexual population and claimed more lives than we ever thought possible , and its end is nowhere in sight ? a terrible holdover for the ' 90s .

Or maybe it was the first hints of the Iran-contra scandal , or Boesky being nailed by the Feds on insidertrading charges . Maybe the wave finally broke and started to roll back on that September night when , with 37 million people watching on television , Pam Ewing planted the tantalizing idea in our minds that we could just close our eyes and hope real hard and when we woke up it would all be over . The ' 80s were the decade in which material success became a kind of free-floating standard of excellence . The opening bell rang on Nov. 4 , 1980 , Election Day : Jimmy Carter , a man so dedicated to deglamorizing the presidency that he carried his own suit bag , was sent packing . Even the Senate went Republican , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the poor misspent ' 70s , a decade of limits and frustration and malaise . President-elect Reagan was the embodiment of the ' 80s . It had been 20 years since we 'd had a leader who was so openly comfortable with wealth and the wealthy . The public seemed fascinated by the air of unembarrassed extravagance that floated around the Reagans : Mrs. Reagan eventually spent $25,000 on her Inaugural wardrobe . A planned redecoration of the White House family quarters was to cost $800,000 . The price tag for new White House china would be $209,508 . What a relief the Reagans were ! The new First Family 's imperial lifestyle seemed to open a tap in the national consciousness , and all the longings for luxury that had been repressed in the parsimonious Carter years came flowing out . Once again we were allowed to be fascinated with wealth and power ? a guilty pleasure the previous administration had been determined to deny us .

" Bright young reporters clamored for business beats the way previous generations had hungered to cover crime or politics . The circulation of Money magazine jumped from 800,000 in 1980 to 1.85 million in 1987 . It all seemed right . In the ' 80s , the business ? and the passion ? of America was business . Lee Iacocca 's memoirs became the best-selling autobiography of the decade , with 6,110,000 copies in print . Young businessmen like Mitch Kapor of Lotus and Steve Jobs of Apple helped fuel bustling computer industries on both coasts , and an entrepreneur became a cool thing to be . The oil boom made Texas a center of population , power and influence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills might never come due . Awards of law and business degrees , seen more than ever as tickets to the high life , climbed through the mid- ' 80s . Even religion began to look like a good way to get rich ; TV preachers lived high , unapologetically . When Jim and Tammy Bakker got tired of one home they had five more to choose from , one with gold-plated bathroom fixtures and an air-conditioned doghouse . The real nexus of the money culture , of course , was neither Washington nor Heritage USA but Wall Street . The bull market that began in August 1982 introduced a new vocabulary to the public : talk about " raiders " and " white knights " made the buying and selling of huge corporations sound positively romantic . There were whole fortunes to be made even in losing corporate dogfights . In one two-month period in 1985 , raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn both went after Phillips Petroleum . Neither got it , but Pickens walked away from the table with $90 million , and Icahn with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture seemed to run in the veins of the " arbs , " or arbitrageurs ? big players who made their biggest scores buying and selling interests in companies that seemed ripe for expensive takeovers . Among the very highest rollers was Ivan Boesky , who worked 18-hour days behind a 300-line phone bank , lived like a feudal lord and made $115 million in two huge petro-company deals in 1984 . " Greed is not a bad thing , " Boesky said in 1985 . " Everybody should be a little greedy . . . You should n't feel guilty . " Eighty-five percent of his deals , he claimed , were profitable . How did he do it ? Just plain old hard work and gumption , he guessed . " There are no easy ways to make money in the securities market , " Boesky wrote in a 1985 book , " Merger Mania .

Yes , the whispered message went , you can have it all , you deserve it all , yes ... BMW promoted itself as " The Ultimate Driving Machine . " Not just a car , but a " Driving Machine . " Not just a good driving machine , but " The Ultimate . " Nobody blinked at the idea that a song about a shameless gold digger , Madonna 's " Material Girl , " could go to No. 2 on the pop charts . A lot of smiling , prosperous young white men in yellow suspenders and women in floppy ties began to populate TV commercials . This magazine declared 1984 " The Year of the Yuppie .

The next year they were up to 8,900 , and then to 9,101 in 1986 . Applications for 1987 were up 10 percent to 15 percent over 1986 . Law and business degrees both peaked in 1985 , indicating that the preprofessional underpinnings of the Yuppie class were softening . " Dallas " dropped down to No. 11 for the 1986-87 season ? not bad but a good cut below its crushing victory of 1980-81 . The winning program last year was " The Cosby Show , " a cameo of life in the burgeoning black upper-middle class . Madonna 's last two movies , " Shanghai Surprise " and " Who 's That Girl , " stiffed . The appearance of Spy magazine in the fall of 1986 indicated a further rollback in the Zeitgeist : who could have predicted three years ago that a magazine making vicious fun of New York 's rich and famous would be the publishing hit of 1987 ? A typically spiteful Spy piece was its analysis of frivolous consumer items whose whole appeal lies in their enormous expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bonfire of the Vanities , " a savage look at the New York money culture , had a fast ride up the best-seller  | lists this fall . Wolfe has coined the word " plutography " to describe " the graphic depiction of the acts of the rich " that held so much fascination in the ' 80s . In a certain sense , he says , the rapacity of the ' 80s was more in sync with human history than the selflessness of previous eras . In the late ' 60s and ' 70s , Wolfe says , " it was considered very bad form to display wealth . " In the immediate future , " I have a feeling it will no longer be as chic to flaunt wealth . " By early December Madison Avenue had bailed out of Yuppie merchandising . A print ad produced in 1986 for Integrity Life Insurance Co. showed a vintage car and a yacht , with the caption : " All life insurance lets you provide for your children . Ours lets you buy toys of your own . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin Sloves told The Wall Street Journal . Yuppies fell into disgrace gradually . Jim and Tammy Bakker did n't . Their sudden fall was a clear sign the ' 80s are over . The byzantine sexual and financial scandal that unfolded in the wake of Jim Bakker 's March 1987 resignation reverberated through the TV ministries ; the Jimmy Swaggart , Robert Schuller and Oral Roberts programs saw sharp declines in viewership after the Bakkers hit the headlines , and Swaggart and the Christian Broadcasting Network both reported fund-raising dips of about one-fourth . Ivan Boesky took a sudden fall , too , in the autumn of 1986 , when he was nabbed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for insider trading . Boesky agreed to relinquish illegal profits of $50 million and to pay indemnities of another @#  | $50 million . It was a little more than a year later that the disgraced financier was sentenced to three years in jail . Fortune magazine did n't wait that long to weigh in . In early January 1987 it named Boesky " Crook of the Year . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the death knell of the ' 80s ? came on Black Monday , Oct. 19 , when the Dow took a dizzying 508-point drop . Not everyone felt affected by the crash ( although securities firms surely did , laying off some 4,000 people in the two months that followed ) . And the market did begin to drift up again , regaining 261 points by the end of last week . But no one who saw big chunks of their pensions lose value overnight can dismiss Black Monday easily . Now everything is different . Maybe the best pop-culture indicator of the post- ' 80s spirit is the respectful reception given to Oliver Stone 's dreadfully ham-handed " Wall Street " : if audiences were n't predisposed to despise stockbrokers , scenes like the one in which the young broker gazes down from his East Side penthouse and asks " Who am I ? " would be laughed off the screen . Eighty percent of respondents to a NEWSWEEK Poll think people in big business and on Wall Street seem more greedy today than they did five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that respondents said were losing favor . Yuppies placed third . The first-place finisher , by one point , was drugs . The story of politics in the ' 80s can be told in two words ? Ronald Reagan . His presidency seemed charmed from its very first moments : just as Reagan took office the Iranian hostages flew home after 444 days . The new president bathed in a tide of good feeling . His predecessor slipped away almost unnoticed . What an enormous contrast there was between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter ? Carter the technocrat , steeped in details , utterly unable to inspire ; Reagan the ideologue , cheerfully ignorant of many complexities , more of a national father than an administrator . He had campaigned on promises to make America great again , cut taxes , increase defense spending and balance the budget within two years . The annual budget deficit was then running at about $74 billion . How was he going to clean up the economy without raising taxes ? Reagan favored something called supply-side economics , which held  | that tax cuts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great popular victories in the early Reagan years : inflation was brought down , and the 1981 tax bill did indeed reduce personal-income taxes by about 23 percent over four years . Legislative infighting studded the bill with tax breaks for special interests . The microinvasion of Grenada was symbolically if not militarily important , underscoring in a dramatic way that America would not be pushed around on the world stage . ( Or , at least , not on a 133-square-mile Caribbean island whose principal export was medical students . ) There were setbacks as well . But through an assassination attempt and a recession Reagan seemed indomitable , and an air of bullish self-confidence took hold in the American people . The perfect movie star for the ' 80s was Sylvester Stallone , whose Rambo was a wildly popular caricature of resurgent American nationalism . By January 1984 , when he announced for re-election , Reagan could claim that " America is back and standing tall . " And in the election campaign that fall , he could point with pride to about 6 million new jobs created during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Soviet-bashing . In 1983 his speechwriters coined the phrase " evil empire , " which lacked subtlety but managed in a stroke to communicate the president 's view of the Soviets as ruthlessly expansionist . The Reagan administration put in place the largest peacetime defense increases in U.S. history . On a more petty level , the Soviet ambassador was no longer allowed to enter the State Department through the garage . The president 's innermost feelings seemed to be revealed in a crack he mistakenly made into an open radio mike before a 1984 broadcast : " My fellow Americans , I am pleased to tell you that I 've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever . We begin bombing in five minutes . " It was the offhand slip of an utterly confident man . The political ' 80s seemed like they would go on forever . But in the late summer and fall of 1986 , in politics as elsewhere , the decade started to wind down . A simplification of the tax code rolled back many of the corporate concessions enacted in 1981 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corporations . The Republicans lost control of the Senate in the fall , despite weeks of stump campaigning by the president ? suggesting that his popularity did not translate into wide , deep support for the party . The first bits of the Iran-contra scandal began to leak . The report of the Tower commission , issued in February 1987 , would only put an official stamp on what everyone already suspected : the president " clearly did n't understand " what was going on . Out in the country , some people began to mumble that maybe old detail-driven Jimmy Carter was n't so bad after all . By late this year the Reagan presidency was in deep shadow . All two-term presidents suffer the same fate ? lame-duck status late in their second terms ? but this seemed to mark the passing of an era . Hard-liners abandoned the president when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to Washington to sign an arms-control agreement , and Americans saw the extraordinary sight of Reagan and the far right quarreling bitterly over Soviet-American relations : the president questioned the devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Reagan " a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda . " The spurned hard-liners ' fury , columnist Michael Kinsley wrote in The Wall Street Journal , " really represents the first flowering of Reagan nostalgia . For those Reagan nostalgics , the Ronald Reagan of today is . . . a betrayer of the legacy , a dispeller of the magic . " The budget deficit for fiscal year 1986 was $221 billion , the highest ever . Late in 1987 a national poll found that , although the president 's personal popularity remained high , for the first time in four years a majority of Americans disapproved of the way he was handling the economy . Forty-nine percent disapproved of his handling of foreign policy . Just before Christmas ex-Reagan aide and close friend Michael Deaver was convicted on three counts of perjury in an influence-peddling case . The president issued his condolences from a White House that seemed increasingly ghostly . Of 19 aides and associates who had gathered for a New York Times group photo in 1981 , only three remained . Fun became a serious business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ' 80s ideal of recreation was to have MORE fun in LESS time and be DONE WITH IT . Two first novels by young authors were hailed ( or damned ) for their portrayals of the New York and Los Angeles party scenes . Jay McInerney 's " Bright Lights , Big City " detailed a coke-snorting Yuppie 's endless journey through the Manhattan club world in pursuit of Serious Fun . The fact that he never seemed to actually enjoy himself while he was out having fun elucidated a peculiarly ' 80s notion : that the pursuit of good times could be a joyless function . Bret Easton Ellis 's " Less Than Zero " was even gloomier , a peek through the Levolor shades at southern California  | brats . These were the most dangerous of God 's creatures : adolescents with money , too rich and jaded to care about anything . Our fascination with work , wealth and power slipped over from work into playtime in the ' 80s . Exclusive nightclubs seemed to emerge , flourish and close overnight in a process that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designing skyscrapers with an antic energy that sometimes bordered on the ridiculous . ( The AT &T; building , with its Chippendale pediment , looks in the Manhattan skyline like nothing so much as King Kong 's breakfront . ) The emblematic athletics of the ' 80s were running and aerobics , neat models of the get-ahead work ethic : faster , higher , longer , more . Cocaine was the prototypical drug of choice for the ' 80s ? a drug that one could take and still go to work , secure in the illusion that I 'M DOING FANTASTIC . Says editor Steve Hager of High Times magazine , " Coke was the drug if you wanted to sit and work for extended periods of time . " With expensive tastes and the money to indulge them , Americans went food crazy during the ' 80s . Esoteric culinary trends followed on one another like a school of blackened redfish ? from Dove Bars to Cajun to tapas . The food craze most representative of the decade was West Coast nouvelle ? tiny portions of exquisitely arranged foodstuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravages of stylization in the ' 80s . Sales of both pasta and Mexican foods expanded , but in neither case were restaurateurs content to leave simple food simple : at last count there were 100 different shapes of pasta available domestically , from anelli to ziti ; owners of Southwesternstyle restaurants gave us blue Margaritas . And for those who did n't have time to prepare beautiful food because they were **33;1042;TOOLONG , there were always frozen dinners . The premium end of the frozen-entree business grew steadily through the ' 80s . Then the ' 80s ended . The great American public turned a corner and said : Enough . This is getting on our nerves . Let 's get real . This year the premium frozen-entree market declined somewhere from 10 to 30 percent . Where are all those food dollars going ? Maybe to ersatz ' 50s diners like the Fog City in San Francisco , or Ed Debevic 's in Chicago . The foodstyles of the rich and famous are out ; what 's in , according to The New York Times , is " hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . . . honest and simple food is good ; elegant and effete is bad . " Could it be that the years of exotica are over ? Wolfgang Puck , owner and chef of Spago in Los Angeles , thinks so . " It 's honesty in food , " he says . " People go to an Indian or Chinese restaurant and they do n't ever know what they 're going to get . At a diner , they know . " In exercise , says Peg Angsten , R.N. , editor of American Fitness magazine , " there seems to be a new reasonableness . " Marathon running peaked in 1982-83 with 137,000 finishers in major races ; the number was down to about 125,000 in 1987 . A Gallup poll commissioned recently by American Health magazine found that two-thirds of adults who exercise regularly  | now do fitness walking , with nearly half adding it to their regimens in the last six months . There are some 4 million fewer people doing aerobics this year than in 1985 , the peak year of the craze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new , post- ' 80s feminine ideal ? curves are in . Designers like Donna Karan made a big splash with business clothes that are sexy but serious . Professional trendspotter Faith Popcorn sees Americans getting " a little fatter . One of the big trends is toward gaining weight . It shows health and it shows security . " There 's a sea change from the pump-it-up days of the ' 80s ? fat is good ! Some builders are moving toward reasonableness , too , toning down huge postmodern skyscrapers and moving toward simplification and preservation . Developer Mortimer Zuckerman recently announced plans to cut half a million square feet of floor space from his gargantuan Columbus Circle project in New York City . His financial partner and principal tenant , the troubled investment banker Salomon Brothers , had just withdrawn from the project . Perhaps the biggest generational change as the ' 80s end is that virtually no one thinks cocaine is glamorous anymore . Before " Less Than Zero " made it to the screen the producers performed " laser surgery " on the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production at Twentieth Century Fox . Drug use was toned down and the female lead kicked her cocaine habit . Preview audiences liked the new , anticoke version better . High Times recently switched its focus from coke to marijuana , and circulation rose 14 percent . Coke may have gone better with the solipsistic spirit of the ' 80s , editor Hager says , but those times are over . " Marijuana takes people outside their own egos to look at the world as a larger package . " So does MDMA , a.k.a . Ecstasy , which first made a splash in 1984 and is popular on some college campuses . Neurologist Stephen Peroutka recently surveyed Stanford students and found that 39 percent had tried Ecstasy , a mild psychedelic whose chief effect is to make the user feel all warm and snuggly and safe ? just the opposite of cocaine . Peroutka says that Ecstasy has taken hold in the West and Texas , but interest is wider than that : when Harvard psychiatry professor Lester Grinspoon lectured on the drug at the University of North Car-olina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grinspoon is quick to point  | out that " there is no drug that does n't have risk . " Animal research indicates the possibility of brain-cell damage . But the impulse behind Ecstasy consumption ca n't be explained away so easily . One bad thing about cocaine was that it made you want to go out all the time ; as the ' 80s dwindle , more of us seem to be realizing that it 's so much nicer to just stay home and watch TV . Who would have imagined five years ago that a club called The Couch Potatoes ? a group dedicated solely to the practice of sitting on a sofa and watching television ? would boast 10,000 members ? The great inroads made by video-cassette recorders surely have something to do with the Couch Potatoes ' rise : there are VCR 's in 51 percent of American homes today , and the 50 millionth unit was sold in October . Sales of popcorn ( the food , not the professional trendspotter ) rose 16 percent from 1986 to 1987 . Dinner , a show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive evening , " says " Head Spud " Robert Armstrong of Dixon , Calif . " Why not just stay at home ? " TV viewing may even be the aerobics of the ' 90s . " I 've always pushed for people watching more TV , " Armstrong says . " It 's beneficial . It 's relaxing . It lowers your heart rate . " In fact , home is where we 're going in the post- ' 80s . Americans responding Ito a NEWSWEEK Poll were almost three times more likely than they were in June 1986 to say that " staying home with family " is their favorite way of spending an evening . The group most likely to feel this way is people 30 to 49 , suggesting that after six years , 11 months and 15 days of struggling to get ahead , aging baby boomers are thinking longingly of settling down and taking a nice nap . The homes we are returning to as the ' 80s end are built for comfort , not for speed . Merchandising expert Bernard Ozer sees Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own home like a little village . " When clubgoers do go out these days they are going to places like Nell 's in New York or Pasha in Dallas ? clubs that look like cozy living rooms . " Cocooning grows , " says Faith Popcorn ( the professional trendspotter , not the food ) . " We 're going to really get into everything that symbolizes security . It 's going to be an age of reality , where people will indulge only in a small way . " There are indications that more people are thinking of paying as they go : a poll conducted by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency shortly after Black Monday found that a third of young consumers say they 're more likely to stop using credit cards and that 39 percent will be more careful to track down bargains . Says Ray Brown , head of the popular-culture department at Bowling Green State University , " A return to the old financial morality is evident , because the new morality was too damned expensive . " Everywhere , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles about young people returning to houses of worship for the first time in years . The terrifying threat of AIDS has made a quiet , monogamous home life seem newly appealing to sin- gle people . The year 's most talked-about movie , " Fatal Attraction , " which had sold $117 million worth of tickets by mid-December , unsubtly links extramarital sex with death ? a romantic chiller for the age of AIDS . Marriage is being viewed more than ever as a refuge from the scary world of sexual adventurism , which may explain in part the booming marriage-counseling business and the fact that the divorce rate leveled off in 1986 after a steady 15-year climb . " Fatal Attraction " ends with the audience cheering the demise of the psychotic home-wrecking antiheroine . Says filmmaker John Hughes , audiences " want to see a woman dead who dares to attack the institution of family . " There are signs of increased altruism in the ' 90s as well .

The 30-year theory at least has a comforting ring to it . It suggests that as a people we may dither about through the complicated constructs we know as decades , calling them in retrospect by shorthand names that evoke great national mood swings ? the ' 60s , the ' 70s , the ' 80s ? but that finally we are subject to forces greater than ourselves and are just body-surfing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dizzying selfobsession of the bygone ' 80s .
