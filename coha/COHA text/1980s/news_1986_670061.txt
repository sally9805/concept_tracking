Associated Dry Goods Corp. said it is holding merger talks with suitor May Department Stores Co. , but the companies have reached a deadlock because they can ' t agree on a stock-swap exchange ratio . An Associated executive said yesterday that the retailer is willing to continue talks with May . " The discussion paths are open , " he said . " But this matter ( the stock exchange ratio ) remains to be agreed upon . " May said it had sweetened its stock-swap offer of $66 a share , or about $2. 7 billion , before Associated declared that talks were stalled . Under the new offer , May would swap 0. 85 share for each of Associated ' s 40 million fully diluted common shares outstanding , which at yesterday ' s closing price of May ' s stock would give the sweetened offer a value of $67. 68 a share . May ' s common closed at $79. 625 , down 25 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday . Wall Street sources said that prior to the break-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on price to about $100 million to $150 million . The sources said that negotiators for Associated had indicated they were willing to recommend to the company ' s board an offer of just below 0. 9 May share for each Associated share . Alternately , they would accept an offer closer to May ' s 0. 85 exchange ratio if it included a so-called " collar "  --  a minimum dollar price for Associated shares in case May ' s stock price fell sharply . Under this alternative , there would also be a maximum dollar price . Despite the breakdown in talks , the two sides appeared closer than ever to reaching an agreement , which would create one of the nation ' s largest retailers . Wall Street traders reacted favorably to news that the two retailers had been holding private merger talks , despite that May is pressing a hostile tender offer for Associated . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Associated common rose 62. 5 cents to close at $65. 625 on volume of 1 , 687 , 700 shares . That market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer by St. Louis-based May . In addition to its previously announced $66-a-share stock swap , May has also launched a hostile cash tender offer at a lower price of $60 a share , or $2. 4 billion . New York-based Associated last week rejected both offers as inadequate . Associated also disclosed yesterday that it has contacted several prospective buyers who are interested in each of its store divisions , which include the upscale department store chain , Lord &; Taylor , as well as the Northeastern discount chain , Caldor . Associated said it is sending internal data about the operations of its divisions to parties that sign confidentiality agreements . Wall Street analysts and industry insiders said Associated ' s announcement about the talks , which stalled Wednesday , is designed to pressure May into further sweetening its latest offer . The switch in May ' s stock-swap offer from a fixed dollar value to an exchange ratio means that the value of May ' s offer to Associated shareholders will fluctuate with the price of May stock , which has been falling since May began its takeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share yesterday was down from the $87. 75 it traded at when May launched the stock-swap offer June 20 . David C. Farrell , May chairman and chief executive officer , said in a letter yesterday to Associated chairman and chief executive Joseph H. Johnson that May ' s sweetened stock-swap bid is " an extremely fair offer and would be very attractive to your shareholders if they were permitted to vote upon it . " Although Associated wants an even more favorable stock swap formula , Mr. Farrell said he hoped Associated ' s board would accept May ' s newest offer . Associated is also under pressure because its options appear to be narrowing . A competing offer for Associated hasn ' t emerged in the three weeks since May made its initial offer , which leads Wall Street analysts to doubt that one will yet develop . " There apparently isn ' t a white knight out there , " said Monroe H. Greenstein , a retail analyst for Bear , Stearns &; Co . Analysts hadn ' t thought that the U.S. retailers large enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole company , but rumors had circulated that an unidentified foreign consumer products concern was possibly weighing an offer . Investment bankers say that Associated ' s options now are : to win a sweeter bid from May , to liquidate the company if it can get a higher price than the May offer , or to sell major Associated units and use the proceeds to buy back shares . Associated touched on the last option yesterday , saying that it is " actively continuing to explore the possibility of repurchasing " its shares " before , after or during " any asset sales . Mr. Farrell said in his letter that May ' s sweetened bid " is a superior alternative to a bust-up of your company , given all of the risks which that strategy must , of necessity , entail . " Even if Associated tried to liquidate itself , May would still consider buying the Associated units for sale , Mr. Farrell said . But many analysts are skeptical that Associated management is willing to spin off the best parts of the retailer , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic route of a complete liquidation . It isn ' t clear that Associated could raise enough money from selling all its units to beat May ' s offer to shareholders . Wall Street sources noted that Associated , in announcing the breakdown of merger talks , didn ' t label the latest May offer as inadequate . They also noted that throughout the takeover fight , both May and Associated have avoided harsh polemics and at times have even praised each other . Meanwhile , Associated also disclosed yesterday that the U.S. district court in Richmond , Va. , is scheduled to hear May ' s motion to stop the state of Virginia from triggering an anti-takeover statute that would hinder May ' s tender offer . Associated is incorporated in Virginia . Associated said that the federal court rejected May ' s motion to transfer the litigation to New York .
