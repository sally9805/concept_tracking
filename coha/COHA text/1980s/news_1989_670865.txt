The overall advance , which was somewhat higher than expected , matched that of the April-June period . And economists found reason to cheer in the report ' s indication of lower third-quarter inflation , even though that was mostly a reflection of falling energy prices. // The Bush Administration said it found little of concern in today ' s report on the gross national product - the total of goods and services generated by the economy - and portrayed the latest data as essentially positive. // " The news is good , " Michael J. Boskin , the President ' s top economic adviser , told reporters at a White House briefing . " The economy has sustained its moderate growth through the third quarter . We expect it to be able to continue to do that for some time to come. " // But a highly pessimistic dissent was registered by C. Fred Bergsten , head of the Institute for International Economics and a Treasury official during the Carter Administration . <> <> No Growth in Exports // He said the trade data in today ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 15. 1 percent rise in imports , were " really bad news . " The United States , he said , is in danger of moving suddenly from years of export-led expansion to " import-led recession. " // Michael R. Darby , Under Secretary of Commerce for economic affairs , acknowledged " disappointment " over the trade data , but he said recent surveys of corporate purchasing managers indicated that export orders were starting to rebound . He added , however , that the strike against the Boeing Company , a top exporter , could undermine that trend. // The dominant sentiment among private analysts was that growth is likely to slacken significantly in the current quarter. // " When you look at the sources of strength , " said Stuart G. Hoffman , the chief economist at Pittsburgh National Bank , " it seems to me you won ' t be able to repeat many of them in the fourth quarter . " Prominent among the strengths was a boom in sales of bargain-priced automobiles as the model year ended. // The inflation data in today ' s report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial sector , this suggested to many that the Federal Reserve would shortly take another modest step to reduce interest rates . In the credit markets today , however , bond prices edged lower , sending interest rates up slightly as market participants were generally unmoved by the report . The stock market had a broad-based decline that traders said was in part a reaction to negative aspects of today ' s statistics. // The G.N.P report ' s fixed-weight price index , which reflects the changing prices of a constant basket of goods and services assembled in 1982 , climbed at a rate of just 2. 9 percent in the third quarter , down from a 5 percent increase in the spring quarter . Falling energy prices contributed significantly to the improvement. // The G.N.P. price deflator , a less precise inflation gauge since it makes adjustments for changes in composition of the basket , also rose at a 2. 9 percent rate during the quarter , down from 4. 6 percent in the April-June period , the report showed. // Reflecting the heavy spending by consumers , who account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage of disposable income slipped to 5. 1 percent , from 5. 4 percent during the spring and 5. 6 percent in the first quarter . <> <> Spending Remains Heavy // Personal consumption spending increased by $37. 5 billion in the third quarter from the second , or at an annual rate of 5. 8 percent . This was slightly more than triple the 1. 9 percent rate of gain posted during the spring and was the biggest jump since the first quarter of 1988. // Purchases of cars and other durable goods , which are items intended to last three years or longer , rose $15. 1 billion , after a $5. 6 billion increase in the second quarter , while nondurables jumped $8. 9 billion , after a drop of $5. 3 billion in the previous quarter . Spending on services climbed more slowly , by $13. 5 billion compared with $12. 3 billion in the second quarter. // But this bounce in the consumer sector was largely offset by a rise of only $6. 6 billion in business investment in plant and equipment , down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline of $2. 3 billion in housing construction after a second-quarter drop of $6. 3 billion ; a $7. 7 billion downward move in the Government ' s purchases of goods and services , and a $22. 9 billion decline in the net export sector , in sharp contrast to a $3. 8 billion gain in the second quarter . <> <> A ' Split Personality ' // In all , suggested Lacy H. Hunt , chief economist for Carroll McEntee &; McGinley , a firm that deals in government bonds , the data " reveal an economy with a severely split personality . " He said the corporate and manufacturing sectors are weak , a situation that is likely to produce a third straight quarter of declining corporate profits . The report on third-quarter corporate profits is due to come out a month from now , when the first revision of today ' s G.N.P. data is released. // Weakness in profits , other analysts have suggested , could become an obstacle to lower interest rates as companies are forced to borrow money they had hoped to earn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to service other debt. // Another worrisome sign , analysts said , was an acceleration in inventory buildup , much of it apparently involuntary . Business inventories added $11. 1 billion to the third-quarter G.N.P. - $6 billion from the farm sector and $5. 1 billion nonfarm - despite a sizable decrease in car and truck inventories. // Mr. Darby of the Commerce Department contended that in general " inventories do not appear to be high relative to sales , " but private economists said that car sales in the first 20 days of this month have been poor and that a fresh round of price concessions would probably be needed to move the vehicles . <> <> Hurricane ' s Effect ' Negligible ' // The report said that Hurricane Hugo , which battered the Carolinas in the quarter , had only a " negligible " effect on G.N.P. but that it had cut personal income at an annual rate of about $4 billion. // The latest figures put the annualized figure for gross national product at $4. 16 trillion , compared with $4. 13 trillion in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the first estimate for the quarter , various assumptions had to be made about the month of September . One , officials said , was that inventory buildup in September was about the same as in August . And another was that the trade deficit was about $9. 9 billion in September , higher than July ' s $9. 3 billion but well below August ' s $11. 3 billion. // Today ' s report also showed that G.N.P. expressed in current dollars , rather than adjusting output for inflation , climbed at a rate of 5. 6 percent in the third quarter , compared with a 7. 1 percent increase in the spring. //
