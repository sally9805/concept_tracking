STORY ON THE FLATS By George H. Rosen Every morning when the weather is fine , I take a walk down Lincoln Street . The views are always gorgeous  --  Winslow Homer painted several series of watercolors in this neighborhood  --  but what most reassures me , most convinces me I am home , are the sounds . There are bird cries , some as easily decipherable as an antiphony of robins , one on each side of the street , or the mewing of gulls . Others are harder to figure : complicated rasps and warbles that only my wife 's family  --  who know these things  --  could identify . In the summer , one can hear the human world as well : the hissing of hoses , doors shutting , the rush of faucets . Always , behind everything , is the surprising sound of the hell buoys ' ring , a soft clang , its source invisible , that heightens my sense of how disconnectedly flat and midwestem the frame houses seem , as if not Dorothy but Kansas had been drawn up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be called Masquash Way . The word means " big moose " or " big rock " or big something in the local Indian speech ; the last syllable has always been obscure . In any event , after the Civil War the residents decided that history outranked nature and the name was changed . The road itself used to wander , hugging the coastline , following each of the string of unimportant coves  --  Goose and Plum and Rock , Streeter 's and Miller 's  --  from George H. Rosen has recently completed a novel , Black Money , set in Kenya . Eastern Point to the harbor . Now , like a river that has lost its meanders , it plows straight through to the shopping district and , even walking , you catch only glimpses of the shellfish flats that Homer painted , snapping by like postcards . In the morning the usual walkers and joggers scrape along , mostly retirees and people like myself who do n't go to the city to work . Mitchell Streeter , a man I 've represented , is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I first heard the expression , eavesdropping on a phone conversation in a doctor 's office , it seemed to mean someone who managed to get around in the outside world despite his psychosis . In fact , Mitchell is a person for whom getting around in the world is his psychosis . Walking is all he does . He goes up and down Lincoln every day , following the same path they use in the Fourth of July mini-marathon , and then goes out to loiter at the traffic circle where the highway comes through . Sometimes he ventures on the shoulder of the interstate . He never hitchhikes but plods along smoothly with his hands in the pockets of an old army jacket definitely not his own , a short , muscular man in his forties with a face of dissolution and a body as trim as anybody 's would be who walked thirty miles a day . Mitchell frequently gets in trouble with the police , but always in small , mostly self-abusive ways . Our town is enormously tolerant of madmen , a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly sauna together . Canons of privacy are only loosely respected and everyone is given the benefit of the doubt . This tolerance can sometimes become lazy , destructive . Lives of pain are lived here without much notice from the community and not all our local lunatics are as genteel as Mitchell . There are horrible , gothic figures of genuine evil who live in sleeping bags in the woods at the center of the peninsula in summer , and periodically make the area the scene of fairy-tale murders , Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel killings . To wander alone in the reclaimed pastureland , now turned back to dark forest , can be chancy and foolish . Mitchell 's father , a widower who , by the way , himself is no prize , is not unaware of his son 's problems and calls him a bum , a word that now has the archaic ring of terms , like " artisan " and " neurasthenic , " derived from outmoded categories . As a lawyer , I am aware that the line between a bum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streeter , however , simply prefers to live in a world of bums rather than crazies . Of course , he is a crazy himself . My next-door neighbor , Bob Streeter , is no crazy , though he is distantly related to Mitchell and his father . Bob is a real go-getter . He jogs , but has already been out and back by the time I make my rounds . Bob has great posture , which I used to attribute to his army service but which is apparently the result of a vertebral fusion . He earns his living as an artist , and unlike me , he is always making toys for his kids . 1 have not made anything out of wood since I fashioned a silent butler in the eighth grade . I do try to point things out for my daughter Laura . I take her for walks in the woods and show her the signs of former habitation : the old foundation holes , hidden among barberry briers and loosestrife , and the ancient roses and parsley that are the remnants of garden plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be as immediately attractive to her as a homemade doll or a wooden boat that floats in the bathtub , but it is what I can do . Bob Streeter is known to be having an affair with Jennifer Moskowitz-Mason , whom I see on my walks , usually stretched out on the ground in her garden . She talks to her flowers and it seems to work . They are enormously gorgeous and healthy , as  --  when she stands up  --  is Jenny herself , a tall , imposing blonde who works as a past-lives therapist in town in a waterfront office not far from my own . Jenny is an Indo-Freudian . She believes that reincarnation opens a vast chain of childhoods to screw one up and is willing to pursue troubles deep into the past . Bob was initially one of her clients , though I believe he stopped seeing her professionally whenthings started to get more serious . Because he works at home and because both our wives take the morning train into Boston , Bob and I often share child care . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not confide in me and he has never actually told me about himself and Jennifer , not that he is under any obligation . I suspect Bob feels that our wives have forfeited something , a kind of citizenship , by going to work in the city and that what we do here  --  Bob and I , our children , and more to the point , Jenny  --  takes place in a protected world that our spouses have no right to challenge . He feels a sense of community and , perhaps , one of complicity as well . For my part , I have no great horror of adultery , but no inclination toward it either . I honestly believe that there are duties associated not with anything as vague and haughty-sounding as one 's position in society but with one 's personality , one 's biology . I 've always thought that , for me , being a family man is something to be accepted and not chosen , more a zoological necessity than a moral compromise . I first met Bob Streeter 's cousin Mitchell when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to sell me a piece of pornographic scrimshaw . What Mitchell really wanted was to borrow money , but he felt he had to offer me something in return . As fewer and fewer men actually go to sea from this peninsula , there seems to be a corresponding increase in peculiar nautical gewgaws . In fact , it made a lot of sense to me that sailors , alone at sea for months at a time with Rorschachian bits of whale teeth in their hands , would do something like this . Mitchell himself had no idea what he was offering . He did not try to point out the workmanship or , on the other hand , to leer . He must have had an attic full of this sort of thing , and when in need simply reached in to grab the first trinket he could find and auction off . " Is this for use or admiration ? " I asked him , thinking myself clever . " I could use ten dollars , " he told me , and waited . His eyes scanned our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It obviously made no sense to him . I told him I would loan him the money if he would pay me back , but I did n't want the scrimshaw . " That 's no problem , " he told me and called me Wilbur , the name of our house 's former owner . I realized , somewhat sheepishly , that while I was intent on teaching him the values of contract and thrift , Mitchell thought I was someone else . His sense of time was broader than my own . Mitchell would be coming back to explain his lack of repayment to others long after I was gone . " Do you keep all your stuff packed up ? " he asked me . Foolishly , I started to explain . " I like that , " Mitchell said as he folded the ten and put it in his shoe . " I really like that . " He looked around , his astonishment of a moment before turned to an immense satisfaction . He clutched the whale ivory like a blackjack , the point into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , " he said , nodding his close-shaven head , not moving an inch . " My father asks after you often . " " Actually , I do n't think we 've met yet . " " Yes . I 'm sorry about that " ? he shook his head even more vigorously , since 1 had just let drop an astounding truth ? " it 's the least that I can do . " We stood for a moment , Mitchell , relaxed now , myself , nervous , afraid he was going to steal something , though of course nothing smaller than a chair was yet out in the room for him to steal . Finally , he said , " Well , now I really must he off , " and was gone . Iam terrified of my daughter 's adolescence . promising girls , the ones who , according to a little printed book of consequences sent out for our twentieth reunion , have all become aerobics instructors  --  divorced , fit , and inviolate . I see Laura tormented , huddled in an upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodied losers being taken away in rented stretch limousines , the waves crashing out beyond the grass . This lawn  --  the location of my terrified dreams  --  is the same one that Mitchell 's father once drove his car over . Angry or drunk , the old man was reasserting his claim to an ancient pathway that would lead him to the site  --  now , in fact , underwater  --  of his cousin 's , Bob 's father 's , house . A month after I had helped push it away from the inlet , the elder Streeter accused his son of stealing the car . Mitchell had , in fact , merely driven it until he ran out of gas in western Massachusetts , where he got out and began walking back here-2.00 miles . The state troopers found him and sent him home on the bus , in the custody of a deputy . Meanwhile , they impounded the car and Mr. Streeter had to go out to the Berkshires to retrieve it . While his father was gone , Mitchell was released , went home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of gas strapped to the rack , onto the road to get the car himself . Local police united the two in Worcester . Mr. Streeter , bitten by remorse , retained me to defend Mitchell on the stolen car charge that he himself had filed . I had the case continued and got them into family counseling . Representing Mitchell , even for just a week , unsettled me , I examined my own family relations . When I was small my father traveled on business a great deal and he once jumped out of a burning small plane , on the ground , rescuing the pilot , only to get on another plane twenty minutes later . I still see this ridiculous act in my dreams , the way my daughter repeatedly watches on the VCR the scene in Dumbo where the elephant-child stands in panic in the burning building , surrounded by maliciously incompetent clowns . She rewinds the tape to see the miracle of the earflaps , the perennial rescue . I see only the foolish re-entry into the flames , the animal trapped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we continue to go back and forth , 1 wonder . Why do n't we exercise judgment when we can ? Bob Streeter is not a good painter , but he is my desk in the study and asked permission to go for a boat ride with Mr. Streeter . Bob takes the children out often , in a red dinghy that he made himself , naturally , without nails or any other kind of metal . I checked the weather light , puffy clouds , a low , pleasant wind  --  and , reminding Laura to wear her life jacket , granted her request . A few minutes later I watched the red rowboat making its way out across the shining water , the steady-dipping oars black against the light . The space between the back windows of our houses and the shellfish flats is a vast plain where the water , even at the highest tide , never gets more than a few feet deep . Its impracticality for navigation lends to its consideration as an aesthetic object . On still days , it can seem purely ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Washington Monument , places where wading or gliding in a shallow boat becomes a subversive act , as much because it destroys an object of contemplation as because it violates local ordinance . Of course there are no laws against rippling the water here , but you can understand why the tide is never running in Homer 's watercolors , why the skiffs lie still and the clam diggers are stopped for a moment in their toil . With their bodies bent over and hats obscuring their faces , their skin and the white of their clothes are , like the empty anchored boats , always mirrored quietly in the tidal pool . As I 've said , the figures in Bob 's paintings do n't have faces either , but there 's a difference . Bob is just painting light as he has been taught . He ca n't see the faces . They are too far away or the sun is too strong . Faces do not occur to Bob . With Homer , the blanks where there should be features are a conscious choice , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of the artist 's imperial malice . Bob , on the other hand , paints what he sees . He has no secrets . The red dinghy drew up on the edge of the flats as I watched , the sand gray and wet in the flow of tide . Bob , nothing more than a silhouette , the bottom of some kind of slicker flapping behind his legs , pulled the bow onto the rise while Laura  --  a swollen munchkin shape in her vest  --  stood at the side . The Streeter kids must have gone to their grandparents ' , Bob and Laura were alone . Bob reached into the boat and picked a dark object from the floor  --  a buoy or a bucket . I hoped he was not intending to dig . The flats up to Ipswich had been closed to shellfishing for months on account of the red tide . He pulled more shapes from the boat : a shovel , a long rake , probably  --  from the distance , it looked more like a spear  --  then a broom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them out . " Do you know Mitchell has Laura out on the boat ? " Jenny Moskowitz-Mason , close to me , looked even more statuesque than usual . She had come straight in and leaned against the desk beside my chair , the skin of her legs cool and troubling to my arm as she peered out the window . She was wearing white tennis shorts and some kind of dinosaur T-shirt , her hair pulled back with a barrette . The button at her waist was loose . " Mitchell ? " " Bob was with me . In the studio . He just took the boat . " She was barefoot and there was a cut above her left ankle as if she had been running through briers . " Was he being hostile ? " " Bob or Mitchell ? " Jenny was wary , she sensed an intrusion . " I meant Mitchell . " " How can one tell ? We just saw it . I thought you should know . " " He did ask my permission . Or he let Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typewriter and senselessly started to stack statute books on the desk . " Mitchell is n't really a hostile person , " she said . " No , he 's not . " Jenny was trying to calm me down . She turned her head to look directly at me , questioning . There were faint drops of sweat where the hair was drawn back above her ear . " You 'd better go get her . " " I do n't have a boat . " " It 's not very deep . " " No , it 's not . " I started to move to the back porch and down to the water , stepped into a pair of rubber sandals , and then , thinking better of it , jumped out of them at the edge of the deck and rolled up the legs of my pants . " Why did n't Bob go after them ? " " I told you . We just saw it through the studio window . Bob thought it was your responsibility . " Irritated , Jenny was having trouble keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know if you 'd given them permission . " " I had . " I left her on the deck and hopped down over the low wall of bricks to the water . She stoodthere with her hand above her eyes , as if on a widow 's walk . Her obvious generosity of intention upset me . Was n't she angry that I 'd interrupted her tryst by having my daughter kidnapped by a madman ? I plowed my way through the soft sucking sand , the water at my knees . Of what exactly was I afraid ? Red tide ? Assault ? Of course , as Jenny had told me , Mitchell did n't harm people , but he did n't help them either . One had to give unceasingly to people like Mitchell . The fact was , they tired me . Mitchell tired me , Bob , hidden somewhere , watching , tired me , Jenny tired me , even my daughter tired me . I was being responsible , wading steady through the inlet , messing up Homer 's still waters , sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what they were doing was no clearer to me . Laura was sitting on the rail of the red dinghy , trailing her toes in the water , while Mitchell , a pointless sou'wester on his head , dug nearby with his shovel . It was definitely a shovel  --  the bag of murderer 's tools had dissolved to the usual equipment  --  but he was n't extracting anything from the sand , merely piling the petty dredgings next to him . If anything , he seemed to be sowing rocks , planting bulbs . I looked back to the houses and could see Jenny , still on the dock , gazing first at us and then , searching , back to Bob 's house . Where was he ? Why had n't he come ? I imagined him in his studio or in his bedroom , dressed , naked , contemptuous , embarrassed , watching me , shielded by the bright sun 's reflection . When Mitchell finally saw me coming , he froze , his arms spread , the rake clutched straight like a staff , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed through the cold tide for three or four minutes , Laura stopped her play . I was spreading immobility , making her afraid . " You 're not going to eat anything , are you ? " It was ridiculous , all I could think of to say as I arrived . Laura stared at rue , dumbfounded . " They 're from Maine . They 're clean . " Mitchell started into rapid motion to defend himself . He reached into his pail and held up a puffed plastic plate oozing bivalves , the shrink-wrap ripped from the top . He was carefully burying a bucket of clams from the Stop &; Shop . " That wo n't do any good , Mitchell , the disease is in the water . " " No , you 'll see . They 'll grow and spread . " I was offending him . He reached back into the bucket . " I brought deodorant , too . " " What for ? " " For the smell . " " Mr. Streeter is silly , Daddy . " Laura began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . She lifted one of the supermarket clams and tried to squeeze from it a response . I turned to Mitchell . " I think you should go in . " " Well , perhaps I should , but I ca n't . " " You ca n't ? " " I 'm stuck . I 'm stuck in the muck . " He began to laugh , at first just friendly , conciliatory giggles , then in wider and deeper breaths , drawing in all the air he could manage , a soft blow of panic underneath a pile of sound . The rising tide had darkened and soddened the sand and Mitchell had , in fact , sunk a few inches into the flat . But his laughter , now a kind of long moan , and the bellowing of his abdomen  --  underneath the flagrant yellow slicker he was wearing only a pair of gym shorts  --  bore no proportion to his slight shift of equilibrium . " Just lift your feet slowly , " " I ca n't . " He began to rock his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs braced , pointlessly paralyzed from the waist down . The rake , still clutched in his hand , swung wildly in the air . The dread in Mitchell 's face was greater than any terror of quicksand . It was as if he were afraid he would never move again , but be imprisoned forever in the flats like one of those faceless , sexless models of Homer 's , rendered permanently anonymous . I pulled the rake from his grip and clutched Mitchell around the middle , tugging his feet from the suction . We bumped foreheads , and the jolt pushed his cap off and down to where the creeping tide could catch it . With an increasing hatred , I imagined Jenny and Bob at their observation posts , taking it all in . Mitchell , in his tenor , contributed nothing . He was pure burden , a graceless strength pulling me down . Laura grabbed my belt and I melted in gratitude as we accomplished the last few inches to free Mitchell 's toes . The wind blew suddenly cold . Mitchell walked in little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two underneath the running tide . His legs vibrated in the tremors of whatever drug the doctors were forcing him to take . " Now , " he said , " I 'll leave . " His eyes followed his hat , floating up the inlet as if it were a treacherous pet that had wandered . I wanted to leave him there to fend for himself , to pick my daughter up , take her to the dinghy , and row in over this false sea to our house . Of course , I could n't . He was crazy . He would panic again . He would drown in the shallows . Laura was afraid now , the water creeping up her ankles , the clouds in the sky somehow lower . I was going to have to play St. Christopher and carry her the 500 feet across the inlet while Mitchell took the boat in . Far across the water , I could hear a chainsaw buzz . Bob stood at the edge of his own lawn . His white shorts , his ramrod back were all 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm fine , really I am . " There was a predictable surprise now at the end of each of Mitchell 's sentences , the last second thinned and upbeat , catching the tremor of his limbs . I started to give orders . " Get in the boat , Mitchell . I 'll push you off . Do n't be afraid . " " But where are the oars ? " He looked at his hands . " Right there . I 'll push you off in the right direction . The tide will carry you in . " He had nothing to do but follow the flow that would bend him toward the land . " Thank-you . Thank-you . " He made no move to the oars , but laid his hands limply on his lap as he sat on the thwart . He screwed his head back as I ran him off the bar . " My father says you should always say thank-you when people do good things , " he confided to Laura , an instruction , a secret . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tide pushing at us . Mitchell , running with the tide , racing to the shore , did n't even have to row . " I wo n't get stuck , will I ? I do n't want to get stuck , " he yelled to us , the same terrible catch in his throat . Then he waved  --  a soft , perfunctory , good-morning wave  --  and I waved back , a nod , a reassuring smile . This was all good cheer now , in order to avert catastrophe . The boat flowed in gracefully , tugged to a slight turn at the gentle channel in the middle of the inlet , then , puffed along like a child 's paper vessel , it brushed forward toward the sloping lawns . Mitchell , easing to land , had turned his waves from us to Bob and Jenny , who , now that the die was cast , had both jumped into the water . They were broadcasting greeting , a warmth of welcome , splashes of celebration , drawing in the lunatic to the bosom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinghy 's line and hauled : the artist unwilling to let go of his creation . The three of them settled into peaceful procession . With one hand Bob towed his cousin  --  in state in the skiff  --  and with the other he met Jenny 's outstretched fingers . Gently , 500 yards from me , they walked on water . At sea on the flats , I was scared my daughter was learning that I did n't like everybody , a small , forlorn secret she probably already knew . But there was more . I felt I was glowing harm . I could sense the heat in my arms , in my thighs , in the muscles of my jaw . Pillared in the sand , my daughter clinging to my leg , I was certain that even all the artistic water washing at our feet could never cool my heightened , dangerous temperature . I stood on the bar , ready to carry my daughter home , steadfast and full of rancor. ?              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
