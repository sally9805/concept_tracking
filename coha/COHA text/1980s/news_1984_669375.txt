// ' ' The problem of protecting concrete from salts commonly used to control ice has been perplexing , ' ' writes Kenneth E. Boyer of ProSoCo Inc . , Kansas City , Kan . ' ' Antifreezes are always very detrimental , not only to the surface itself but also to any coating that is applied to the surface. ' ' // His company will soon offer a new sealer which , among its other traits , is said to offer excellent resistance to salt spray . There may be other such products on the market , but at this time we are not aware of them. // The material , Conservar 290 Siloxane , ' ' has been subjected to 50-cycle salt spray tests under the test procedures of ASTM ( American Society for Testing and Materials ) , ' ' writes Mr. Boyer . It was developed by a West German chemical manufacturer and has been marketed in Europe for more than 30 years. // It does not result in a high buildup and thus is not excessively hazardous when wet. // In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While these products do resist abrasion , they are only moderately effective against salt sprays . Also , they are extremely slippery when wet. // The ProSoCo product is only available at one of its three manufacturing facilities : 111 Snyder Road , South Plainfield , N.J. 07080 . In the late spring it will be available through many of the company ' s regular Sure Klean distributors across the country. // If any readers know of a product and method of handling ice without harming the substrate , please let us hear from you. // // Q What kind of oil should I use to lubricate the bearings of an electric motor which runs a pump for a hot-water heating system ? I was told that nondetergent oil should be used . Is this true ? <> John Doughty . Denver // // Is it an ancient motor ? We ' ve been told that for many years electric motors have been built with sealed bearings that require no lubricant. // An oil that contains additives is a no-no , we ' re also told. // Maintenance instructions by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment . Some instructions may appear right on the motor housing itself . Do you have such data ? If not , obtain it from the manufacturer , giving the company the serial number of the motor. // It is often said that when all else fails , read the printed instructions . This leads us to advise our readers to always preserve the warranty , parts list , and operating and maintenance instructions that accompany an appliance . You may need them later on. // // Q My 6-year-old brick fireplace , built as part of an addition to the house , appears to have been constructed with too much sand in the mortar . Cement/sand particles literally rub off with moderate finger pressure along the joints . Should this condition be corrected ? If so , how ? // Also , how can I get a copy of ' ' Technical Notes on Brick Construction , ' ' of which you wrote in a recent column ? <> A reader West Hempstead , N.Y. // // It ' s very likely the chimney work is not under guarantee after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may have been derelict , inexperienced , or cheap. // Properly formulated mortar and good workmanship applied by a skilled brick mason lasts for generations . If the contractor is still around , call him back to look at his sandy mortar . Hopefully , an inspection of the cheap mortar may stir his conscience . If so , he might offer belated redress for the sake of his own reputation. // Otherwise , have an experienced brick mason inspect the chimney . He likely will rake out the mortar to a depth of an inch , more or less , and repoint the recesses with sound mortar , tooled to match the original condition. // It ' s no small job ! There are many lineal feet of joints to be repointed. // The purpose of architects is not only to design a structure , but also to protect that design by specifications which describe and require quality materials and workmanship . Architects are usually retained to inspect the work in process and afterward . This assures their client of sound procedures as well as quality materials and workmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work often means the job was without adequate supervision . Significant projects built with masonry have continuous inspection during their erection. // If an architect ' s services are bypassed , choose a reliable contractor with a known track record . Almost everyone leaves a trail . Retain only reputable contractors who are accustomed to doing good work even if unsupervised by a third party. // Did a competent architect design the addition , specify the masonry section , and then observe the work in process ? Was the builder carefully selected for his known record as a builder ? Was the successful contractor the lowest bidder , and unduly low ? A too-low competitive bid all too often results in a poor job. // In one European country , the lowest and highest of 5 competitive bids are rejected . Then the average of the three middle bids is computed , and the bidder nearest to that average wins the contract. // As far as obtaining a copy of ' ' Technical Notes on Brick Construction , ' ' write to the Brick Institute of America , 1750 Old Meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : ( 703 ) 893-4010. // // To the real estate editor : // You really hammered your ol ' thumb with your counsel about Pyrex-brand glass. // First , Pyrex is a trademark of Corning Glass Works , not PPG . Second , Pyrex ( a ' ' . . . recent addition to the tempered-glass idea ' ' ) has been around since Corning sold the first oven-proof glass pie plate under that name in 1915 . Third , the term Pyrex is a trademark for a broad line of glass ovenware and bakeware , laboratory glassware , and other products made of heat-resistant borosilicate glass . There are many Pyrex-brand products ; there is no Pyrex-brand glass. // As for the specific problem you were addressing , I believe you should have recommened that Mr. Zeidler of Austin , Texas , seek a supplier of special low-expansion glass. // I ' m not familiar with the heaters he describes , but if they were made with a glass from Corning Glass Works , it was most likely our Vycor-brand , 96-percent silica glass , which we no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fused silica material. // ' ' Low-expansion ' ' is a term that refers to the rate at which the material expands or contracts with changing temperature . It equates almost directly to the material ' s ability to withstand temperature changes . ' ' Tempering ' ' has little or nothing to do with this property as it deals with the physical or impact-resistance of the glass material ' s surface . <> Alan F.
