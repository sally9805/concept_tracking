Moonlight . Enter Abel , carrying two beers , a small wooden box and an aluminum-plastic beach chair . ABEL Come on out , Mother ! If I have to hear it again I want to listen to it out here !

Could n't give them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in life ! You know . What we had together . What we always had together ! ABEL Mother , I do n't think anybody can give anybody that ! LUCILLE But why not ! They ought to ! I tried to tell Sarah once , what it was like , seeing you for the first time , and not liking you at all , and then you just waiting for me , and waiting for me  --  ABEL Well , I knew , Mother . I just knew ! LUCILLE And from the first time , everything , I mean the first TIME together , like that , well now ! Well now ! ABEL Mother  --  LUCILLE I mean ! ABEL Mother ! LUCILLE I mean ! ABEL Mother , stop fretting about this ! LUCILLE But it was good ! It was always good ! God help us , Father , after all these years , it 's good now ! ABEL I know that ! p. 6 LUCILLE Then why not for them ? Not one , not ONE of them ! What is it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never find , no matter how hard they try ? ABEL Now Mother , hush up ! LUCILLE I WILL NOT ! I never in my life wanted no man but you ! And if what you 're always telling me is the truth  --  ABEL Truth , Mother ! Only time I tried anybody else , I got sick , you know that ! LUCILLE Then why ? WHY ? What did we have all them years , working and sweating and farming and making do , they could n't have too ? WHAT DID WE DO WRONG ? ABEL NOTHING ! THEY did all that ! Hush up ! ! LUCILLE WHAT DID GOD GIVE US HE KEPT FROM THEM ? ? ( it suddenly gets brighter . ) ABEL Look , Mother .

Come between two swans , you get pecked to death ! LUCILLE Who 'd want to come between them ? ABEL I do n't know . Somebody . LUCILLE " The swan is a beauty easy to take , Two are better , upon the lake . " ABEL You just make that up ? LUCILLE No . Read it , yesterday . ABEL Where ? LUCILLE Reader 's Digest . ABEL Oh . LUCILLE It was in some article about zoos . ( Pause . Lucille turns off the music . ) I miss my children . ( Pause . ) ABEL Yeah . ( He spins his reel . The moonlight fades )                  @ @ @
