When the residents of Montebello Poniente ( pop 8,000 ) a suburb of San Salvador on the slopes of one of El Salvador s largest volcanoes , heard the rumblings shortly after dawn , they assumed that it was just another mild earthquake , the sort they had experienced many times before But then a boy ran down the town 's main street knocking on doors and screaming : " The lava is coming , the lava is coming ! He was wrong- the long-dormant volcano had not erupted-but the neighbors who heeded Ms warning were wise . Within minutes , an 8-ft-high wave of water , mud , boulders and uprooted trees all but destroyed Montebello . <P> Houses were ripped from their foundations , and residents suffocated in their beds . Antoniel Garcia , a truck driver was awakened in time to pull his family to safety on the roof of his house . He watched as successive torrents swept cars , furniture and screaming townspeople into a nearby ravine " It will take months to find all the bodies , " he said . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that region of the country . <P> The sudden wave was the result of two currents of floodwater joining forces on the side of the volcano just above the town , followed minutes later by the collapse of a temporary road-construction dam . The disaster , El Salvador 's worst since a 1965 earthquake , followed four days of heavy rains that have devastated El Salvador and parts of Guatemala killing some 1,000 people . As much as 40% of El Salvador 's basic food crops has been destroyed , and damage is estimated at $250 million .
