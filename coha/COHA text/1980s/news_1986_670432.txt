Seeking to address the issue for the first time publicly the other day , Donald T. Regan stood before an enthusiastic audience at the Earl Warren Showgrounds here and , with a hint of cheerful hyperbole , denounced the pollsters , political scientists and others who predicted that President Reagan would prove ineffective in his second and final term. // " Ronald Reagan didn ' t cooperate , " said his chief of staff . " More than any President in recent memory , Ronald Reagan has successfully challenged the conventional wisdom , putting the lie to the prophets of doom and gloom and leaving in his wake a host of flabbergasted pundits. " // Privately , some senior White House officials are far less certain about Mr. Reagan ' s final two years at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , and they voice uneasiness . " He ' s been a lame duck since the day he was re-elected , " said one White House aide . " It ' s the challenge of this term . Every day , every phase the term goes through - that ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // So far , even his critics in Congress concede that the lame duck issue , in which a President ' s popularity and leverage presumably wane in his final years in office , has not afflicted Mr. Reagan . <> <> Dominance of the Political Agenda // According to the polls , his popularity remains extraordinarily high , enhanced to some degree by the bombing of Libya . Tax revision , aid to the Nicaraguan rebels , the selection of Justice William H. Rehnquist to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and of Antonin Scalia to fill Mr. Rehnquist ' s Supreme Court seat , the probability of a summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev - all underscore Mr. Reagan ' s dominance of the political agenda , officials say. // To ward off lame-duckism , White House officials began at a recent planning meeting here at the Western White House to shape a new agenda that includes welfare and immigration law revision , an antinarcotics program , a bill to deal with the costs of catastrophic health care , as well as a United States-Soviet agreement on arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the lame-duck issue with the considerable help of his allies in the Republican-controlled Senate. // " Look , if the Administration had stuck to its 1985 programs across a broad sphere , they ' d be in a disastrous circumstance right now , with the President down in the polls , " said Kevin Phillips , a Republican political analyst . " Luckily for them they have people in the Senate who want to get re-elected and who have a sense of what the public wants . The Senate saved them from themselves. " // Mr. Phillips explained : " The attempt in 1985 to turn back on the farmers , the attempt to slash Government programs in agencies as the key to deficit reductions , the inattention to the trade issue - sort of laughing it off - the early 1985 White House view that the strong dollar was an expression of foreigners ' faith in America , was a flawed blueprint that the Senate objected to . If they were still pushing these , if they hadn ' t backed away , Reagan would be very much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on , is that the Senate has forced Mr. Reagan " to develop trade and agriculture policies that are anathema to what the Administration had in mind at the beginning of the second term. " // " They ' ve done the same thing on deficit reduction and defense spending , " Mr. Phillips said . " It ' s much more centrist , much more in keeping with public opinion. " // On one level , White House aides believe that Mr. Reagan ' s style , personality and communication skills , his ability to use political patronage and his power to use the veto will blur the lame-duck issue and enable him to create a successful agenda for his last years in power. // " The President is popular , the President is determined to get things done , he can prevent himself from being a lame duck , " said Patrick J. Buchanan , the White House communications director . " There ' s the whole bully pulpit here . You can use the bully pulpit to shape the debate. " // Dennis Thomas , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the political ornithologists continually trying to identify the President as a lame duck had best refocus their field glasses , " Mr. Thomas said . " He ' s alive and well and flying high . " " Every year critics say that Ronald Reagan will not be able to achieve anything in the next year , and they ' ve been wrong , " he added . " They ' ve been wrong for six years , and they ' ll be wrong for the next two years . He has a unique ability of setting the agenda , and that ' s 80 percent of the batle . He ' s tenacious . He comes back and back again , and it ' d make Rocky proud. " // But some White House aides are less sanguine . There is already gossip about officials leaving and working for Republican Presidential candidates. // " We ' re not naive enough to think we can go crashing up to November 1988 , but we ' re going to come as close we can , " said one key official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' six-year itch . ' At some point , things begin to give way to the idea of a successor . But we ' re going to try hard to avoid lame duckism. // " We ' re going to have a legislative session in 1987 . We ' re going to bring business to the floor of Congress . We ' re going to conduct international commerce and trade . We ' re going to do international negotiations , including arms control . We ' re planning a domestic agenda . It ' s business as usual , but with a difference . " A Certain Historical Resonance To some political scientists , the views of White House officials that Mr. Reagan is hardly a lame duck so far has a certain historical resonance . The last President to serve two full terms was never afflicted with lame duckism. // " The conventional view is that Eisenhower ' s greatest period of effectiveness , and the period when other politicians and the Washington press were taking him most seriously as someome who could put his own spin on political outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two years of his Presidency , " said Fred I. Greenstein , a political scientist at Princeton who has written a book on the Eisenhower Presidency. // " Politicians got the impression he was calling more people , fully using resources of the White House in terms of patronage , threatening the veto more and speaking out louder and more assertively than in the past , " Mr. Greenstein said . " There was a widely perceived image of Eisenhower as an effective politician late in his term , and it became a self-filfilling prophecy. // " There are many things the White House can do , even very late in a President ' s term , " Mr. Greenstein said . " Patronage . Appointments . There are enormous powers of executive rule-making . In the media age , the President still has the power to take center stage . And Reagan will have that power until his last day in the White House. " //
