Richard Nixon , whose silently whirling recorders had taped unsuspecting visitors to the Oval Office , was unaware that a television camera and microphone were recording his own words and movements as he prepared for a momentous act : his Aug. 8 , 1974 , broadcast in which he announced that he would resign next day from the presidency . A CBS-TV technician , during the technical check , made the videotape and later gave it to a friend , TV Actor Tom Hallick , who made it available to TIME . It shows that Nixon was in an astonishingly light mood as he fought the tension of the grim event . Excerpts : <P> NIXON TO TECHNICIAN : Hey , you 're better looking than I am .
