The ground is hard packed and spangled with bottle caps tamped into the ground by the migrating wave from the south that pauses here every night , without exception , on the route north. // As hundreds each day pause here for the curtain of darkness to conceal their illegal crossing into the United States , the good-natured Spanish banter of a border subculture comes to life. // Silhouettes clearly visible against sand-colored canyon walls , the immigrants talk with a serape-clad Mexican man and his wife who daily wheel their portable barbecue out onto the field , selling tacos and beer . Children from Colonia Libertad , a third-world jumble of a neighborhood that ends abruptly at the soccer field , sell used coats - $1 apiece - to migrants who arrive shivering without them . Polleros , guides who take groups of pollos ( immigrants ) through the canyons into San Diego County , are quietly gathering their groups together and setting prices - $100 a head for Mexicans and as much as $600 for Central Americans. // Here on this flat space just north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross , the immigrants even exchange friendly conversation with the adversary , members of the undermanned uniformed US Border Patrol charged with keeping the illegals out. // Suspended momentarily along the border , the flow of illegal immigration takes on a human dimension before it fans out into the United States to become the faceless national problem that is the subject of great political and economic debate. // Ramon Robledo , shivering through his embroidered cowboy shirt in the early evening chill , shares his story with a stranger . From the state of Guerrero , south of Mexico City , Mr. Robledo estimates some 200 men in all have left his village. // ' ' The only people who live there anymore are women and children , ' ' he says . He says he couldn ' t make enough money at home . His plan is to pick citrus near Santa Ana , Calif. , and send all but $15 a day of his earnings back to his parents and his young family of four children. // ' ' It doesn ' t make sense to spend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs and animals to feed and then sell , ' ' he says. // Mr. Robledo won ' t bring his family to the US , he says , because it ' s ' ' hard enough to go myself. ' ' // Asked if he isn ' t afraid of being caught in the US , Robledo , a father of four , chuckles softly , ' ' Fear is not having beans on the table. ' ' // A dozen others draw near to listen and throw in their own observations . And whether it ' s the quiet , illiterate peasant from the central highlands of Mexico ready to cross the rugged canyons in a pair of plastic shoes , or the more sophisticated urban youth with a high school education and a penchant for gold chains , the theme is the same . While there is hardly a legal welcome mat thrown out for them at the border , they are certain there are US employers waiting to hire them. // Like many men in their hometowns , they ' ve left their families behind and headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their backs . Their own estimates are that they will make 10 or even 100 times more money in the US than they could in Mexico. // From this border vantage two perspectives are clear : // First , it is easy to visualize the unbridled violation of US immigration law here . With the sheer numbers migrating north and this open space being only a fraction of the 2 , 000-mile frontier , it is ludicrous to think that US immigration authorities alone could effectively control the border . Indeed , at the legal port of entry in San Ysidro , Calif. , just a mile from the soccer field , US Customs official Robert Rich says that he ' s powerless to do anything with those immigrants who try to enter illegally right under his nose . Of 35 , 000 immigrants caught with fraudulent immigration papers at this port of entry in fiscal year 1984 , the US authorities prosecuted only five , he says. // Second , this border scene evokes an instant compassion for a wave of humanity that , except for the circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant ancestors of nearly every American . Illegal crossings are about as routine for some as walking to work every morning . But here on the soccer field immigrants must cross into dark canyons and run , duck for cover in the dirt or prickly brush , and cross muddy streams . They hide from Border Patrol agents or , worse , from the notorious ' ' bandits ' ' who prey on the vulnerable immigrants . The motivation for such a humiliating trek begs for examination. // Estimates of the illegal immigrant population in the US range from 1 million to 6 million . Though illegal immigrants from Central American , Asian , Caribbean , and Middle Eastern nations are significant shares of the total , Mexicans constitute the majority , Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say . And Mexicans would be the most affected by the kinds of immigration reform US leaders are trying to produce. // ' ' The question is how you can best deter illegal immigrants and continue our heritage of an open immigration policy , ' ' says INS Commissioner Alan Nelson . The tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercutting our whole our whole legal system . The American public could be saturated with so much illegal immigration that it would react by not letting anyone in at all. ' ' // It is accepted by all sides that there is a large subculture of undocumented immigrants in the US . The main bone of contention in the debate over illegal immigration is whether the impact of this group is good or bad for the US . Some say the undocumented aliens depress wages , displace US workers , and tax the nation ' s resources . Others credit them with helping the economy by providing cheap labor for US business and agriculture not otherwise available. // The immigration debate promises to heat up as soon as Congress convenes next month . Mr. Nelson says the Reagan administration intends to pursue the same basic reforms that have been on the table for the past four years - sanctions against employers hiring undocumented workers , and amnesty for many illegal immigrants already here. // Sen. Alan K. Simpson ( R ) of Wyoming expects to reintroduce immediately some form of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Romano L. Mazzoli ( D ) of Kentucky . Separate House and Senate versions of the bill were passed this year , but a conference committee failed to produce a compromise. // The Hispanic Congressional Caucus , often characterized as obstructionist regarding immigration reform , is planning a reform package of its own . ' ' There are no new ideas on immigration , ' ' says Susan Herrera , legislative director of the Hispanic Caucus . ' ' It ' s going to be what people will settle for ' ' out of an array of highly controversial solutions that have been on the table for several years. // How the problem is interpreted far to the northeast in Washington seems a remote , or even unknown , matter to the people congregating here daily on the soccer field and to many of the illegal immigrants already living in the US. // Ramon Robledo , who has been caught four times in a week by the Border Patrol , says he has never heard of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill . In fact , he is not even aware that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of immigration politics this way : ' ' I love Mexico , the government is the one that doesn ' t love me . The American government doesn ' t like me , either . But there ' s no work ( in Mexico ) and what I like is the work . It doesn ' t make sense to stay and make 400 or 500 pesos a day when in the strawberries or tomatoes ( in California ) I can make $70 on a very good day. ' ' // Is there a law that could keep him out of the US ? Robledo says he doubts it . Before he crosses the border and disappears into the shadows , he adds , ' ' If I don ' t make it today , then tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow. ' ' // //
