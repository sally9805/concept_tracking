Nice guys finish first . Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves proved that last year . He also proved that nice guys can drive in 109 runs , hit 36 homers and bat .281 . And what did he do in the time between the end of the 1982 season and the announcement five weeks later that he was the National League MVP ? He went to the Instructional League to work on his hitting . // Here 's a guy who does n't drink , smoke , chew or cuss . Here 's a guy who has time for everyone , a guy who 's slow to anger and eager to please , a guy whose agent 's name is Church . His favorite movie is Frank Capra 's It 's a Wonderful Life . He 's a wonderful ballplayer. // Here 's a guy who 's chasing the Triple Crown . Through last Sunday , he shared the National League lead in home runs with 19 , ranked second in RBIs with 55 and fourth in batting average at .326 . His 69 runs put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set by Chuck Klein of the 1930 Phillies . Here 's a guy who failed as a catcher but ended up winning a Gold Glove in 1982 while playing centerfield . Here 's a guy who 's 6 ' 5 " , 220 pounds , and he 's going to steal at least 30 bases this year . " He 's scary , " says Reds Manager Russ Nixon . " Do they have something above MVP ? " // And here 's a guy who , after almost every home run , says something like , " Well , I just happened to get good wood on the ball , and the wind was blowing out to rightfield tonight .... " When asked if he feels he has improved on his MVP play of a year ago , Murphy will say , " I ca n't say for sure , I 've been a little lucky this year . I hope I 'm progressing . " Here 's a guy who is Jimmy Stewart  --  the actor , not the former utility player . // " Aw , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil , Atlanta Catcher Bruce Benedict . " Except when he eats . Then he 's a superstar . " // Like the mole on his right cheek , even his faults have their charms . While it 's true that Murphy has never met a doughnut he did n't like , he carries not an ounce of fat on his sculpted frame . He 's occasionally late to practice only because he 's giving his time to someone else . Says Manager Joe Torre , " I 've had to fine him , but many times I do n't know he 's been late until I find his money waiting for me on my desk . " And it 's because Murphy has so many friends in so many cities that he 's won the coveted Ticketron Award , given to the Braves player who uses up the most passes , four years in a row . // " Believe me , I have many more faults than that , " says Murphy . " I do n't want to give people the impression that I 'm an almost perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the early winter of 1978 , Murphy was pulled over for speeding . It happened on the campus of Brigham Young University , which Murphy , a Mormon since 1975 , was attending briefly . He was doing 35 in a 25-mph zone . Where was the fire ? " Well , I was late for a speech before a church group , " Murphy says . // If Murphy sounds too good to be true , rest assured that he is for real . " There is nothing , absolutely nothing fake about him , " says teammate Jerry Royster . Murphy certainly has been proving this year that he 's for real on the field . He was n't an overwhelming choice for MVP last year , and he would be the first to defend his doubters . " I really owe the award to my teammates , " he says . " If we had n't won the division , I would n't have won the award . " Of course , the Braves themselves were thought to be something of a fluke last year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sunday , Atlanta was 43-29 , matching its 1982 pace ; the only trouble with that was L.A. was eight games better than its pace . No other team in the majors had a better record , which left the Braves second in both the division and the big leagues . // There are two sure signs that Murphy has arrived . Boos now greet him on the road , although they are more respectful than nasty . And the mythologizing of Murphy is under way . Before a home game against San Francisco on June 12 , Murphy visited in the stands with Elizabeth Smith , a six-year-old girl who had lost both hands and a leg when she stepped on a live power line . After Murphy gave her a cap and a T shirt , her nurse innocently asked if he could hit a home run for Elizabeth . " I did n't know what to say , so I just sort of mumbled ' Well , O.K. , ' " says Murphy . That day he hit two homers and drove in all the Braves ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs are nice . They 're often looping , opposite-field line drives that just happen to go over the fence . Of his 19 homers this year , all but four have been to center or rightfield. // Here 's a sampler of what opponents think of Murphy : // Astro Catcher Alan Ashby : He 's the best player in the game today . " // Cubs Pitching Coach Billy Connors : " He 's the best I 've ever seen , and I 've seen Willie Mays . I watch almost all the Atlanta games on cable television , and I 've seen Murphy win games every way there is , a base hit in the ninth , a home run , a great catch , beating the throw to first on a double play . I 've never seen anything like him before in my life . " // Phillies Third Baseman Mike Schmidt : " I do n't see why I should talk about another player hitting 100 points better than I 'm hitting . " // And here 's what some teammates think of Murphy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to describe him . Well , there are n't enough good words or words good enough . " // Royster : " If you could improve Andre Dawson , he would be Dale Murphy . " // Torre : " All he does is play baseball better than anyone else . " // Benedict : " He 's overrated . He 's also got big feet . " // Benedict is right about those feet , which are size 13 , but he 's kidding about the overrated part . Actually , some people did think Murphy was overrated last year , especially after he slumped late in the season when Bob Horner , who bats behind him in the fourth or fifth position depending on the pitcher , left the lineup with an injury . " Murph did put a lot of pressure on himself , " says Torre . " And good as he was , I saw ways to improve his hitting . " // At first Murphy was surprised when Torre suggested he go to the Instructional League in Sarasota , Fla. with all the youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planned trip to Disney World with his two sons and wife , Nancy , who was then pregnant with their third son . " I thought it was a compliment that Joe wanted to take the time and go down there and work on a few things with me , " says Murphy . // So , for five days , Murphy dressed with the Atlanta organization 's kids , took 30 minutes of batting practice with Torre and Coach Bruce Dal Canton and talked hitting . " I think we 're seeing the fruits of that work this year , " says Torre . " Take the other night . Dale beat the Dodgers with a sacrifice fly in the ninth off Tom Niedenfuer . Niedenfuer pitched him very well , and last year Dale would 've struck out in that situation . That 's the big difference this year  --  he 's become a much better hitter with two strikes on him . " // The facts of Murphy 's life are that he was born to Charles and Betty Murphy in Portland , Ore . on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for a brief time in Moraga , Calif. when his father , then a sales executive for Westinghouse , was transferred there . Dale played for Woodrow Wilson High in Portland . He signed a letter of intent to go to Arizona State , but decided to try pro ball right away when the Braves made him their first pick in the June 1974 draft . // Jack Dunn , a friend of the Murphy family , was Dale 's coach in both high school and American Legion ball . Now the coach at Portland State , Dunn recently visited Murphy in San Francisco when the Braves were playing the Giants . " I always knew he was something special , " Dunn says . " I know it 's just a coincidence , but did you know that the man who discovered Babe Ruth was also named Jack Dunn ? " // In 1976 , though , Murphy was being touted as the next Johnny Bench . He had the prerequisites : a live bat and a rifle arm . He also had a new religion , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints frequently do . Ted Turner , owner of the Braves , got wind of this and asked Murphy 's parents if he could talk to Dale . They said yes , but be careful , Dale 's very serious about this . So Turner reached Murphy in Portland and the first thing he said was , " What 's all this Mormon stuff ? If you need to make converts , I 'll let you work on me and my five kids . " // Turner did n't talk Murphy out of his mission , but some officials of the church , including a former minor league pitcher named Paul Dunn , convinced him that he could serve while playing . But then something happened . Murphy began to develop a mental block about throwing to second base . He would either hit the pitcher , even if he were crouching on the mound , or he would throw the ball into the outfield . As his father told him , " One thing 's for sure , Dale . Nobody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks back on that time with humor . " I think they put me in centerfield because it 's as far away from home plate as possible , " he says . Actually , the Braves initially tried Murphy at first base , but he could n't make throws from there either . On March 12 , 1980 Bobby Cox , then the Atlanta manager , sent Murphy to leftfield . Suddenly he could throw again . // Like George Bailey ( Jimmy Stewart ) in It 's a Wonderful Life , Murphy was given a second chance . In the movie a despairing Bailey is about to leap off a bridge when his guardian angel , Clarence Oddbody , appears . While talking Bailey out of suicide , Oddbody says , " You see , George , you 've really had a wonderful life . Do n't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away . " Murphy , literally , almost threw his career away . // " I never got as low as Jimmy Stewart did in the movie , " says Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd be able to stay in the minors , much less play in the majors . I could n't throw , and it was very frustrating . I had all this God-given talent , but all of a sudden I could n't play . I tried to keep it in perspective and tried not to let it affect my relationships with people . Fortunately , I came through . But I realized that even without baseball , it 's a wonderful life . " // As soon as Murphy moved to the outfield , the throwing phobia disappeared , just like that . In 1980 , while performing in unfamiliar territory , mostly centerfield , he hit .281 with 33 homers and 89 RBIs . In ' 81 , for reasons neither Murphy nor anyone else can explain , his production fell off sharply . Turner wanted to cut Murphy 's ' 82 salary 20% to $320,000 , but Dale and his agent , Bruce Church , negotiated the Braves back up to $360,000 , plus $40,000 in bonuses , all of which Murphy cashed in on . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Braves agreed in February to a five-year , $8 million contract , making him the fifth-highest-paid player in baseball . The contract was also a boost to the LDS Church , because Murphy tithes the usual 10% and contributes additionally to other church funds . He did allow himself the luxury of a new silver Corvette . // Murphy apologizes for not being more colorful , though he 's extremely generous with his time . " I wish he was more selfish , " says Benedict . " But then he would n't be Dale Murphy . " Often a teammate will have to pull Murphy away from an interview session and tell the interrogators , " Sorry , Dale has to go to batting practice now . " // The Braves like to tell stories about his eating . According to Second Baseman Glenn Hubbard , " He once complained that the watermelon in the clubhouse was rotten . That was after eating five pieces of it . " Says Royster , " I 've seen him order everything on the menu except THANK YOU FOR DINING WITH US. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouse target . " Hey , Dale , " shouts Benedict . " How come you do n't say , ' Hi , how are you , how you feeling ' anymore ? You just say , ' Can I have your tickets ? ' Then you go have a doughnut . " In truth , Murphy is very solicitous when he asks a teammate for passes . // Murphy does get upset every so often . Says Hubbard , " I remember he once got mad at the opposing pitcher for showing up his catcher . The catcher had dropped a throw from the outfield , and the pitcher was glaring at him . Dale told our pitchers he never wanted to see any of them do that to one of our catchers. " // " I saw him get mad once , " says Torre . " It was this year in San Diego , where the fans are right on top of the dugout . This one fan was screaming obscenities at us . Well , Dale starts getting red , then gets on the top step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You can shout whatever you want . Just do n't cuss . ' I think the entire stadium fell silent . " // The one thing Murphy ca n't abide is women journalists in the locker room . Last year two female writers walked into the Braves ' clubhouse as Murphy was being interviewed in his undershorts . He excused himself , put a jersey around his waist and went up to the women . " You just ca n't come in here , ladies . It 's just not right , " he said . Having been confronted by Jimmy Stewart , they retreated . Right or wrong , Murphy 's stance is a matter of honor to him . // It 's as if he stepped out of the past or , at least a Frank Capra movie , to take his place in centerfield for the Atlanta Braves . And every time he hits a home run , he 'll say he just happened to get good wood on the ball , and the ball just happened to carry ....        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
