 | Depending on whom you ask , Hollywood is either on the brink of a new golden age or in the terminal grip of its worst creative crisis . It is either led by vigorous , visionary new leaders or run by a gang of overpaid incompetents . Its future is either threatened by the rise of the videocassette recorder or the VCR is salvation itself . The major studios are either doddering dinosaurs or more powerful and profitable than ever . " More people are watching feature films than in half a century , " explains Variety 's Art Murphy , the dean of business watchers , but fewer are watching them in theaters , where attendance was off last year by almost 12 percent . What no one will deny is that production and marketing costs have risen at an almost Brazilian rate of inflation : the average cost of a major-studio film now is a staggering $15.8 million , compared with $11.9 million just two years ago . It 's estimated that only 10 percent to 20 percent of all movies make their money back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's almost impossible for a well-run studio not to make money . Why else would so many studios be takeover targets ? Recently Columbia has been lapped up by thirsty Coca-Cola ; the Bass Brothers have bought a controlling interest in Disney ; Rupert Murdoch has folded Twentieth CenturyFox into his media empire , and Ted Turner has made his move on MGM/UA . It 's a brand-new shooting match in lotus land , in short , and the rules are changing as fast as Clint Eastwood 's draw . The movie business ? an expanding and diversifying corporate complex , with major tentacles in television production , cable TV and the booming video market ? bears little resemblance to the one-dimensional industry we associate with Louis B. Mayer and Clark Gable . In this whimsical , ego-ridden and unpredictable business , worried executives are reading the stars to chart their course . Will the movie business always be a crap shoot , or is there a more scientific way to make sure-fire profits ? Out of this extraordinary turmoil are emerging visions of the future that are startlingly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 30s and ' 40s , when the studios reigned supreme . Two developments loosened their iron grip . The first was a Paramount consent decree in 1948 that forced divestiture of their theater chains . No longer could studios afford to keep writers , directors and stars under exclusive contract . The second was the rise of television . But now some Hollywood executives are replicating the old studio system by taking advantage of new technologies and an old nemesis , television . They are even beginning to buy theaters again . It is not impossible to envision a studio in the near future that controls its product in a  | vertically integrated system that includes production , distribution and exhibition . The most provocative vision of a new age ' studio , at least in creative terms , belongs to the new Walt Disney Co . There , an aggressive new management team , composed of chairman Michael Eisner , movie and TV division chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and president Richard Frank , is signing up young producers , writers , a few directors ? even actors ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warners of old . Glory days : Of all the majors ? Paramount , Warners , Fox , Universal , Columbia , Orion , MGM/UA and recently Tri-Star ? Disney has been , in the last 20 years , the perennial also-ran . A consistent flop maker , it lived off the memory of its glory days under its founder , Uncle Walt , and its profits from theme parks and real estate . All that changed in 1984 when the Texas-based Basses bought their controlling 25 percent and brought in Eisner &; Co. to dust things up . No longer would Disney be synonymous with G-rated family movies ; the aim was to become competitive with the big boys . The first thing to know about the new Team Disney is that these guys like to work . Hard . Significantly , Eisner , Katzenberg and Frank are all veterans of Paramount , which under the strong leadership of Barry Diller ( now the head of Fox ) became the most cost-conscious ? and one of the most successful ? studios in town . The 35-year-old Katzenberg is usually at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two breakfast meetings . Seven-day weeks are not unusual . He 's known in the trade as " The Golden Retriever . " If there 's a talent out there he wants , a script he covets , he gets it faster than anyone . With the enormous cash flow of the other corporate divisions behind them , Team Disney has wasted no time getting the action rolling on both movie and television fronts . Nearly a hundred projects are currently in some form of development . Disney 's first showcase film has just come out ( under the Touchstone logo ) : Paul Mazursky 's " Down and Out in Beverly Hills . " Bingo . In its first three weeks of release , it has reigned as the No. 1 film in the country . Not only that , the one new TV hit show of the fall season , " The Golden Girls , " is a Disney product . Two Saturday-morning kiddie cartoon shows ? " The Wuzzles " and " The Adventures of the Gummi Bears " ? have already made it big , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very respectable start early in February , with Eisner himself serving as host . Though the top brass prefer to let their product speak for itself , the Disney philosophy , in a nutshell , is to keep costs down by controlling the concepts . In other words , if you want to avoid getting into a costly bidding war for the latest hot property some agent is peddling around town , develop your own hot property . Then the talent will come calling on you , at your price . To this end , they have put under exclusive or semiexclusive contract scores of young writers and producers . " The best thing about it is that there 's a spirit of creative camaraderie , " enthuses producer Lauren Shuler ( " Mr. Mom , " " Ladyhawke " ) . Daniel Petrie Jr. , the screenwriter of " Beverly Hills Cop , " can show a new script to three other writers on the lot before turning it in , all of which inspires an almost collegial atmosphere that Disney encourages . Decisive and fast : For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive arrangement . The studio has a vested interest in seeing its projects succeed . Says David Bombyk , the young coproducer of " Witness " : " There are some studios that make a deal with you to develop a script and then dare you to make the movie . They say , bring it back with Robert Redford attached . Here , they like to be in charge , but when they approve things they 're prepared to back you up . A producer will take a project in to an executive and he 'll say , That 's a perfect project for so and so down the hall . ' And that , in a sense , is a little like the golden age of Hollywood . " Unlike most Hollywood executives , the Disney boys are both decisive and fast . " If you turn in a script , they read it that weekend , " claims Petrie . And if they like it , they  | wo n't wait to see if some big-name director wants to get involved . " They make their decision based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no studio can survive without big names : the star system is an inescapable fact of Hollywood . The success of a studio like Warners ( the top studio for the last two years ) is built on its long-term relationships with such luminaries as Clint Eastwood and Goldie Hawn . The Disney men have no such guaranteed bets , but they 've made long-term deals with Shelley Long and with Bette Midler , one of the stars of " Down and Out in Beverly Hills , " who will appear next summer in a black comedy called " Ruthless People . " Equally important , the Disney execs believe they can create stars . To that end , they 've signed up the young actress Meredith Salenger from " The Adventures of Natty Gann " and have an exclusive deal with a new discovery , the unknown Nancy Stafford , whom they hope to turn into their own Goldie Hawn . Their scheme can be compared to baseball in the era of free agentry . While Cannon films , for example , resembles the George Steinbrenner approach to the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffman for $6.3 million ? Disney 's model would be Hollywood 's own Dodgers . The Dodgers have become the most financially successful team , and one of the best , because they build from the bottom up , cultivating a superb farm system . Big-buck sluggers : But even Team Disney knows that it must sometimes pop for the big-buck sluggers , since the top stars will never again submit to a contract system . ( They are more likely , like Redford or Eastwood , to form their own production companies . ) Disney 's big Christmas movie this year is a star-studded package under the direction of Martin Scorsese ? a followup to " The Hustler " with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise . While they 're hoping to keep their average movie cost to $9 million , this one is budgeted at $14 million . The contract system , of course , wo n't pay off for Disney executives unless they get their money 's worth of work out of their talent . If the average studio releases only 15 or 20 movies a year , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The answer ? at least at Disney ? is that contract writers and producers wo n't be working solely on movies . In what may be Disney 's most quietly revolutionary move , it has completely merged its film and television divisions , the first studio to do so . It used to be that no self-respecting film person would consider crossing over into television ? that was where you came from , the wrong side of the media tracks . But when a Steven Spielberg alternates between " The Color Purple " and " Amazing Stories , " you know times have changed . And for good reason : it is TV production that has been keeping the studios afloat all these years . Michael Eisner drove this point home recently when he stated to a press gathering that television " is the No. 1 priority ... more important than all the movies we 're doing . It 's our face to the future . " The fact is , the medium that was going to bury the movie business is instead saving it . A highly successful series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 million or more in the syndication market ? more than a hit movie like " Back to the Future . " Syndication of old TV programming has become one of the most crucial revenue sources for the studios , which produce much of the network product ? and , thanks to a Nixon-era decision , keep control of the shows . Fortunes can be made selling a " Family Ties " to the expanding number of independent TV stations . Combine this with the money from so-called first-run syndication shows , like " Entertainment Tonight , " and lucrative deals with cable TV ( HBO paid close to $38 million for " Ghostbusters " alone ) and sales of old movie libraries to television , as well as the booming home-video market , and it 's clear why television is in fact the No. 1 source of studio income . It 's so important , in fact , that some studios have begun buying their own television stations . Merging TV and movie divisions at Disney means that a producer can move easily between a feature project and , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For writers and directors , this is manna from heaven : no longer will they have to spend most of their time selling themselves over power lunches and waiting for their agents to phone . They can actually ply their trade . As Jonathan Taplin , a producer turned entertainment investment banker , says , " If the talent could spend more time knowing they have a job to do ... they might all get back in touch with why they decided to get into this business in the first place . " Not everyone in Hollywood is impressed with the new , gung-ho Disney . Some agents and lawyers dismiss it , perhaps a tad defensively , as so much hype ; it is their share of the action the Disney plan would cut out of the deal . Universal head Frank Price , who has built his success on all-star , big-dollar package deals like the $30 million " Out of Africa , " admires what Disney is trying but doubts it can work . " If I thought I . could only make low-budget films I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . For some creative people as well , Disney 's hands-on approach can be anathema . One top entertainment lawyer has clients who refuse to have their projects sent to Disney , fearing excessive executive interference . Too many cooks : Even the best-laid plans of Mouseketeers and men , however , can not guarantee that Disney will make better movies than anyone else . And quality is , in the end , the bottom line . The one thing most people agree on is that Hollywood is suffering a serious creative crisis . Says one Hollywood lawyer : " I think it 's safe to say that the level of executive competence today has never been so low . " ( Disney is trying to reverse this trend by assuring career executives that they wo n't lose their jobs over one flop film . ) Legions of inexperienced and overpaid vice presidents ( a ubiquitous Hollywood title ) are passing judgment on scripts they are ill trained to assess . " A lot of the power brokers in this town are agents who started at 17 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you can read well enough to address an envelope , you can make $15 million decisions . " Status often means more to these rising execs than moviemaking . " They 're more interested in walking into a party with a blonde on their arm , a great watch and a great car , " adds the executive . " That 's success here ? it 's more important to get the right table at Mortons  | than to go home and break down a script . " The development process itself is often a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth . First a lowly reader will pass judgment on a script . If there 's interest , a junior executive will then order a set of revisions . But he wo n't have the power to get the movie made . At the next stage , a senior executive will decide he wants the script rewritten for a Harrison Ford type , and the hero 's occupation changed from adman to offshore oil rigger . Finally the president of production or the chairman ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the movie ? takes a look at this hodgepodge , throws up his hands in disgust and orders up the original script . He thinks it has potential but maybe should be rethought as a comedy , so why do n't they bring in screenwriter Y for a rewrite ? And so it grows , the writers getting richer ? and crazier ? with each new draft . Chuckles independent producer ( " Witness " ) Edward Feldman : " This is the most overpaid business in the world . Failure pays $180,000 . " All this lucre is being paid to people to figure out what John and Jane Public want to see . But every year the wisdom changes , depending on what movies have recently struck gold . Right now every studio executive in Hollywood will tell you they want " upbeat , life-affirming movies , nothing dark or cynical . " They 're looking for mysteries ( because " Jagged Edge " was a hit ) , for action adventure ( read " Rambo " ) , for comedy adventure ( " The Jewel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( " Out of Africa " ) , for adult comedies ( " Down and Out in Beverly Hills " ) . Last year 's hot items , teen comedies , are cold as ice . Is this creativity , or photocopying ? Fun-house ride : Not all the blame can be laid on nervous studios , lame executives and rising costs . Cultures have their own rhythms of creativity . Perhaps the country has grown too smug , too jaded , too selfinvolved , choosing comfort over provoca- tion , assurance over doubt . Is it any wonder that the artist loses his bearings and doubts his ability to make a dent in what seems like a monolithic culture ? An aging generation now prefers pesto to Pasolini ; the young equate movies with a fun-house ride , a surge of adrenaline . And Hollywood , ever democratic , is there to oblige . Whether or not Disney 's master strategy ultimately solves Tinseltown 's woes , it may succeed in restoring some business sanity to a volatile industry . Artists are an insecure lot , and stable homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveries . The movie business has always been about creative dreaming . A good studio can nourish those dreams , but in the end , alone in the dark , it 's one-onone : a Pariavision Scheherazade , and the viewer who 's paid $6 to hear a human voice . re .
