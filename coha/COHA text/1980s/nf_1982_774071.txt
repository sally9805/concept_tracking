txt // said to be a reducing sugar and this reducing action forms the basis of several tests for glucose and other reducing sugars . For example , glucose will reduce an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate to metallic silver and an alkaline solution containing cupric ions , known as Fehling 's solution , to cuprous oxide . Glucose was originally given the structure shown . The carbon atoms are numbered so that reference can easily be made to them later . The mirror-image form , L- ( ? ) - glucose , has been synthesized but it is not found naturally . The sign indicating direction of rotation does not always correspond with the letter indicating the configuration at carbon atom 5 and , indeed , there is no reason why it should . For instance , D-fructose , another common naturally occurring monosaccharide , is laevorotatory and is correctly named D- ( ? ) - fructose . These prefixes are often omitted unless it is necessary to draw attention to the configuration or sign of rotation . All aldehydes give a pink colour when mixed with Schiff ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 are asymmetric and , as would be expected , glucose is optically active . It is dextrorotatory and this is indicated , as usual , by a ( + ) placed before the name . The prefix D is also often used ; it indicates the disposition in space , or configuration as it is called , of the hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group on carbon atom 5 . Ordinary glucose is D- ( + ) - glucose and using the projection formulae discussed in Chapter 4 it is represented : // Glucose , however , does not affect Schiff ' s reagent and for this and other reasons it is now thought that glucose is not an aldehyde at all but that it is very easily converted into one during the course of many reactions . Glucose is now given the cyclic structure shown below . This is just a development of the formula on page 120 . In this structure there is no aldehyde group at carbon atom 1 but a new hydroxyl group . Carbon atoms 1 and 5 are connected by an oxygen atom to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly part of the hydroxyl group at carbon atom 5 is now part of the new hydroxyl group at carbon atom 1 . This is a rather awkward method of writing the formula of glucose , because the ring and all the groups attached to it appear to lie in one plane . A semi-pictorial formula , such as that given below , provides a better idea of the actual shape of the molecule . The plane of the ring is supposed to be projecting from the plane of the paper with the thick edge towards the reader . The substituent groups lie above and below the plane of the ring . It will be noted that carbon atom 1 is asymmetric in the above ring structure whereas in the open chain formula on page 120 it is not . Because of this , two isomeric forms of glucose are known which differ in the configuration at carbon atom 1 . Ordinary glucose is a-glucose and // the other form , fl-glucose , can be obtained by crystallizing glucose from hot solvents . /3-Glucose is of no importance from a practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in water some of the molecules change into the other isomer and an equilibrium mixture is obtained which contains both forms . This conversion is believed to take place via the open chain aldehyde form and a small amount of the aldehyde form is probably always present in a solution of glucose . This explains why glucose behaves as an aldehyde in many reactions . The secondary alcohol group at carbon atom I is often called the potential aldehyde group or reducing group . Nutritive sweeteners based on glucose are increasingly being used as a complete or partial replacement for sucrose in many manufactured foods . Glucose Syrup is the best known of these products and is made by hydrolysing maize starch by heating it under pressure with dilute hydrochloric acid . The composition of the sweet colourless syrup produced varies according to the degree of hydrolysis and is defined in terms of the reducing power of the syrup expressed as its dextrose equivalent ( DE ) . For example , the carbohydrate content of a 43 DE syrup is about 20 % dextrose , 17 % maltose and 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confectionery as they prevent crystallization on cooling ( see p. 130 ) . Glucose syrups with a higher DE value contain less dextrins and more glucose and maltose and are therefore sweeter than those with lower DE values . They are used particularly in jams and preserves . More recently it has been found that if glucose syrups with a high DE value are treated with the enzyme glucose isomerase up to half the glucose is isomerized into fructose . The resulting high fructose glucose syrup is at least as sweet as sugar because of its high fructose content and has the additional advantage of enhancing fruit flavours . It is expected that such syrups will find extensive use in many products but particularly in soft drinks and jams and preserves . D-Fructose , Laevulose or Fruit-sugar Fructose is a laevorotatory sugar and is found with glucose in the juice of sweet fruits and in honey . It is obtained , with glucose , when sucrose is hydrolysed . Like glucose it is a powerful reducing agent . It is sweeter than both glucose and sucrose . Fructose was originally given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glucose , this was found to be unsatisfactory and it has been superseded by a cyclic structure involving a six-membered ring . a and /3 forms are possible as with glucose . // DISACCHARIDES Disaccharides are formed by the union of two monosaccharide molecules , with loss of water : ( C6H , , 05 ) OH+HO ( C6H1105 ) -* ( C6HI105 ) -O-(C6H1,05)+H20 Two monosaccharide molecules A disaccharide molecule It is not possible to prepare disaccharides from monosaccharides in the laboratory by this process despite its apparent simplicity . Nature , however , accomplishes it without difficulty . Disaccharides are easily split into their component monosaccharides by enzymes or by boiling with dilute acids . Many disaccharides are known but the most important , and the only ones of interest in food chemistry , are maltose , lactose and sucrose . Maltose or Malt Sugar Maltose is obtained from starchy materials by the action of the enzyme diastase . The enzyme maltase hydrolyses maltose to glucose and this may also be accomplished by heating with dilute acid . D-Glucose is the only monosaccharide formed during these hydrolyses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maltose is a reducing sugar and measurement of its reducing power shows that only one of the potential aldehyde groups is free , the other being involved in the formation of the link between the two D-glucose units . The link between the glucose units between carbon atom 1 in the first glucose unit and carbon atom 4 in the second . Maltose can exist in a and fl forms and this is why the configuration of carbon atom 1 in the second glucose unit has not been indicated . This is the potential aldehyde group responsible for the reducing power of maltose . Carbon atom 1 in the other glucose unit is in the a configuration . // Lactose or Milk Sugar Lactose is a white crystalline solid which is somewhat gritty in appearance . It occurs in the milk of all animals : cows ' milk contains 4 ? 5 per cent and human milk 6 ? 8 per cent . On hydrolysis of lactose with the enzyme lactase or by boiling with dilute acid , equal quantities of D-glucose and the monosaccharide D-galactose are obtained and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a reducing sugar hence at least one of the reducing groups is free . Lactose has the following structure : Sucrose , Cane Sugar or Beet Sugar Ordinary sugar , whether obtained from sugar cane or sugar beet , is substantially pure sucrose . It is a white crystalline solid which dissolves in water to give a dextrorotatory solution . Sucrose is widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom in many fruits , grasses and roots and in the sap of certain trees ; it is produced and consumed in far larger quantities than any other sugar . Over two million tons of sucrose are used annually in this country ( which is roughly 41 kg per person per year ) and of this about one-third comes from home-grown sugar beet . On hydrolysis with dilute acids , or the enzyme sucrase , sucrose gives equal quantities of glucose and fructose , so the sucrose molecule must // contain one glucose unit combined with one fructose unit . It is unable to reduce Fehling 's solution or ammoniacal silver nitrate so the reducing group in each monosaccharide unit must be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucrose does not have the usual six-membered rinbut a five-membered ring : Sucrose is very readily hydrolysed to glucose and fructose , the latter having the normal six-membered ring structure . Fructose is more strongly laevorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory and so the mixture of glucose and fructose obtained on hydrolysis is laevorotatory . This change in the sign of rotation is called an inversion . The mixture of glucose and fructose produced by the inversion is called invert-sugar and has been known in the form of honey for many centuries . Bees collect nectar , which is essentially sucrose , from flowers and it is inverted by enzymes during passage through their bodies . Honey is not pure invert sugar because it contains , in addition to glucose and fructose , some sucrose , about 20 per cent water and small quantities of extracted flavours peculiar to the flower from which it was obtained . When sucrose is used in the preparation of acidic foodstuffs a certain amount of inversion invariably takes place . For instance , if sucrose is used for sweetening fruit drinks it is completely inverted within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sucrose is obtained commercially from sugar cane , which can only be grown in tropical countries , and sugar beet which can be grown in any temperate climate . Whichever is used , the same product is obtained ; there is no difference between the sugar obtained from sugar beet and that obtained from sugar cane . PRODUCTION OF RAW SUGAR FROM SUGAR CANE . The sugar cane is a type of giant grass which resembles bamboo and may grow to a height of 4.5 metres with a diameter of 3 ? 5 cm . The sugar , which amounts to about 15 per cent of the weight of the cane , is found in a soft // fibre in the interior of the cane . From three to eight tons of sugar are normally obtained from an acre of sugar cane . The sugar is extracted from the cane by crushing and spraying with water . The solution obtained contains about 13 per cent sugar and 3 per cent impurities , the rest being water . This solution is purified by boiling and adding lime which precipitates some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface as a scum . The lime and impurities are removed and the clear solution obtained is concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure until a mixture of sugar crystals and mother liquor is obtained . The crystals are separated from the mother liquor by spinning the mixture very quickly in large drums . These drums have perforated sides through which the mother liquor , called molasses , is forced by centrifugal action , leaving the raw sugar behind . The molasses are used for the manufacture of rum and industrial alcohol . PRODUCTION OF RAW SUGAR FROM SUGAR BEET . The sugar content of sugar beet is similar to that of sugar cane but only about two tons of sugar can be obtained from an acre of sugar beet . The sugar is extracted from the shredded beets by steeping them in hot water ; it diffuses through the cell walls into the water , leaving behind most of the non-sugar solids . Batteries of specially designed diffusers are used to ensure that the maximum amount of sugar is removed by the minimum quantity of water . The solution obtained contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the remainder being water . It is treated with slaked-lime , and carbon dioxide is passed through the solution . The carbon dioxide combines with the calcium hydroxide to give calcium carbonate which settles to the bottom of the solution , carrying with it most of the impurities . After removal of the precipitate the clear solution obtained is concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure to give sugar crystals and molasses which are separated by centrifuging as described for cane-sugar . The raw sugar obtained is very similar to that produced from cane-sugar but may have a less attractive taste and smell . SUGAR REFINING . Raw sugar , whether obtained from beet or cane , contains about 96 per cent sucrose . It consists essentially of sugar crystals coated with a layer of molasses . The first step in the refining process is to mix the raw sugar with sugar syrup to produce a stiff semisolid mixture of syrup and crystals . This is centrifuged and the syrup is forced out , leaving the sugar crystals within the centrifuge . The sugar crystals are then washed with water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contained in the syrup and wash liquors from the centrifuge and this is recovered by evaporation of the water under reduced pressure . // The sugar crystals are next dissolved in water and treated with milk of lime and carbon dioxide as was described for the production of raw beet sugar . This removes the bulk of the impurities and the remainder are removed by allowing the solution to percolate through a bed of bone charcoal some six metres deep . Before this treatment with charcoal the solution is brown in colour but the product , known as fine liquor is colourless , all the coloured impurities having been adsorbed by the charcoal . All that remains to be done is to concentrate the fine liquor by evaporating the water , and crystallize the sucrose to produce uniform crystals of the correct size . The evaporation is carried out at reduced pressure in steam-heated vacuum pans ' so that the water can be removed at a temperature much below the normal boiling point of the solution and this prevents any discoloration of the sugar . A small charge of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-saturated . This is then seeded with caster or icing sugar to produce a large number of tiny crystals which act as nuclei for subsequent crystallizations . This seeding operation is known as graining and when it is complete the evaporation is continued with gradual addition of more and more fine liquor until the crystals grow to the appropriate size for granulated sugar . By careful control the addition of fine liquor can be made continuous , the rate of addition being varied as required . The crystallizing process formerly depended mainly on the skill and experience of the person carrying it out but it is now largely controlled by instruments which maintain the degree of supersaturation within suitable limits . At the end of the crystallization the sugar crystals are suspended in syrup . Spinning in centrifugal machines removes most of the syrup , the remainder being removed by spraying with hot water and centrifuging . The syrup and washings contain about 40 per cent of the sugar originally present in the fine liquor and most of this is recovered by decolorizing and recrystallizing . This can be repeated several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sugar recovered from the syrup do not conform to the high standards required . When this happens the syrup is used for the manufacture of Golden Syrup or is concentrated and crystallized to give a soft brown sugar . Caster sugar is made in the same way as granulated sugar but the crystallization procedure is modified so that much smaller crystals are obtained . This is done by using a larger number of nuclei or by preventing the crystals from growing to granulated sugar size . Caster sugar is also obtained as a by-product of the production of granulated sugar and it is separated from it by sieving the dry sugar . The particle size in icing sugar is even smaller than in caster sugar and it is made by // pulverizing granulated sugar to an extremely fine powder in special mills . Brown sugar is obtained by crystallizing from the syrup obtained at the end of the refining process . Such sugar , known as pieces or yellows , is slightly sticky because of the presence of a thin coating of mother liquor on each crystal . Lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was described for granulated sugar but a special technique is used to produce two sizes of crystals , the larger of which provide the characteristic sparkle of lump sugar while the smaller bind the crystals together . The mass of crystals and mother liquor produced is run into special cylindrical moulds which are slowly cooled so that the contents set to a rigid mass of sugar crystals soaked in syrup . The moulds are so designed that they can be rapidly spun on centrifugal machines to remove excess syrup . The last traces of syrup are removed by washing with specially pure concentrated fine liquor , which is itself subsequently removed by centrifuging . The solid sugar is carefully dried to remove final traces of moisture and is then cut by machine into the familiar cubes . SUGAR CONSUMPTION AND HEALTH During the present century world consumption of sugar has tripled . In Britain annual sugar consumption per person which was only 2 kg in the early eighteenth century is now about 41 kg , roughly half of which is bought by the housewife as sugar , the other half being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present high level of sugar consumption must be considered undesirable on 3 main counts ; it contributes to obesity because sugar not required for energy is converted into fat ; it increases the rate of dental decay and it is possibly related to the high incidence of coronary heart disease . There is a direct relationship between sugar consumption and dental decay . Decay starts through the formation of a plaque or film on the surface of teeth which adheres to the tooth through the action of dextran , a sticky , complex carbohydrate . It is now known that dextran is synthesized from sucrose with the aid of bacteria present in the mouth and this fact indicates the prime importance of sucrose in causing dental decay . When carbohydrates are absorbed by the body there is not only an increase in the level of blood sugar but also in triglycerides and cholesterol . As pointed out on p. 115 the incidence of coronary heart disease is related to the high levels of these last two substances . Recent experiments have shown that sucrose ( and fructose ) are more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as starch and glucose . It should be noted that although there is some evidence relating high sugar consumption to coronary heart disease the validity of this evidence is questionable and only a minority opinion accepts that there is a direct link between them . FOODSTUFFS MANUFACTURED FROM SUGAR SUGAR CONFECTIONERY . The term sugar confectionery is used to describe the large range of confectionery we commonly call sweets ' . Boiled sweets , toffees and caramels , the filling used as centres for chocolates , marshmallow , nougat , pastilles and gums are all examples of sugar confectionery . This great variety of tooth-decay accelerators have one thing in common they are all produced by controlled crystalliz ation of sucrose from a supersaturated solution . The differences that exist between them depend upon water content , the extent to which crystallization of sucrose has occurred , and the presence of fat or milk , which enables emulsions to be formed , and flavouring agents . When a concentrated solution of sucrose a syrup ? is heated the temperature at which it will boil depends upon the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FIG. 7.6 . The boiling points of sugar solutions The water content of a sugar solution can be accurately determined from a knowledge of its boiling point . If boiling is allowed to continue the concentration of the solution increases as water evaporates and the // boiling point increases . Soft sweets , such as toffee , are cooked to a lower temperature than hard sweets such as butterscotch or boiled sweets . Boiled sweets are traditionally made by boiling sugar solutions with acidic substances to produce a certain amount of inversion . Boiling is continued until the temperature reaches 150 " C by which time almost all the water has been driven off and , on cooling , the mass solidifies as a glass-like solid ? the familiar boiled sweet . At the end of the cooling period only a small amount of water ( a few per cent ) is present . The glucose produced by the inversion process prevents the sucrose from crystallizing when the mass is cooled down . It is said to cut the grain ' . Glucose itself does not crystallize easily from water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glucose inhibits the crystallization of the sucrose . The final product is a supersaturated solution of sucrose , with smaller amounts of glucose and fructose , in a very small quantity of water . The amount of invert-sugar produced during the boiling must be carefully controlled because too much will make the product prone to take up water from the air and become sticky . This is because the fructose in the invert-sugar is hygroscopic . On the other hand , if too little invert sugar is produced it will be insufficient to prevent crystallization of the sucrose . About 10 ? 15 per cent invert-sugar is the amount required to give a non-sticky non-crystalline product . Any acidic substance may be added to produce the inversion , and cream of tartar is commonly used . The amount of acid used depends upon several factors , including the hardness of the water , but it is quite small and , in the case of cream of tartar , is in the region of 0.15 ? 0.25 per cent of the weight of sugar used . Boiled sweets are made commercially by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 122 ) which prevents crystallization of the sucrose in the same way as invert-sugar . The amount of glucose syrup used can amount to 30 ? 40 per cent but the product is not hygroscopic because it contains no fructose . Glucose syrup is less sweet than sucrose or invert-sugar and so the boiled sweets produced in this way are also less sweet . In addition , the dextrin in the glucose syrup is said to impart a certain toughness to the sweets and can sometimes cause cloudiness . The creamy material used for filling soft-centred chocolates and by biscuit and cake manufacturers for decorative purposes is known as fondant . It consists essentially of minute sugar crystals surrounded by saturated sugar syrup . Fondant is made by boiling a sugar solution and adding glucose syrup or an inverting agent as in the case of boiled sweets . No attempt is made to boil off all the water , however , and the mixture is only boiled to 116 ? 121 ? C compared with 149 ? 166 ? C in the case of boiled sweets . The // syrupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by running on to a rotating water-cooled drum from which it falls into a beater . Here it is agitated violently to induce crystallization which occurs suddenly to produce a very large number of tiny crystals . Control of the water content of the syrupy solution is very important ; if it is too low insufficient saturated syrup may be present to fill up the spaces between the sugar crystals in the fondant which may crack and craze as a result . It is possible to make fondants containing only sucrose but they are rather hard and crystallize and dry out quickly . Moreover , fondants containing no glucose are susceptible to fermentation and may become mouldy because of the growth of yeast cells and moulds in the syrup surrounding the sugar crystals . It has been shown that fermentation can not occur in syrup containing more than 78 per cent of sugar solids because the micro-organisms responsible can not tolerate such concentrated solutions . A saturated solution of sucrose in water , however , contains only 66.5 per cent sucrose at normal temperatures and this is conducive to mould growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inversion of sucrose or added in the form of glucose syrup the concentration of sugars in the syrup is too high for the yeast cells to flourish and fermentation is not possible . Toffee consists essentially of a dispersion of minute globules of fat in a supersaturated sugar solution . Fat , milk , sugar and glucose syrup are the main ingredients . Various grades of sugar are used , depending upon the recipe , from the best quality granulated sugar to raw sugars and treacles which contribute characteristic flavours to the product . As in the case of boiled sweets , sugars other than sucrose must be present to prevent graining . In home-made toffee an inverting agent such as vinegar or citric acid may be used to produce some invert-sugar from the sucrose , but in commercial practice it is usual to employ glucose syrup to prevent graining . The milk used makes an important contribution to the flavour and is added as condensed milk , either full-cream or skimmed . The characteristic colour of toffee is largely due to caramelization of the milk solids during cooking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulsifying agent . Butter and various vegetable fats are used in the manufacture of toffee , and emulsifying agents , such as glyceryl monostearate or lecithin , may also be incorporated if insufficient milk solids and butter are present , to aid in the dispersion of the fat and produce a stable emulsion . In toffee manufacture the ingredients are boiled together until the temperature reaches the required value . The temperature attained in the boiling process largely determines the consistency of the toffee produced // because this depends , among other things , on the amount of water in the toffee . Very hard toffee such as butterscotch is heated to 146 ? 154 ? C , which gives a water content of 3 ? 5 per cent . Ordinary toffees and caramels are heated to 118 ? 132 ? C when the mixture contains 6 ? 12 per cent water . Temperatures were formerly estimated by removing a sample , cooling it in water and examining it when cold . The temperatures are known by distinctive names such as soft-ball ' , hard-ball ' , soft-crack ' and hard-crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This method gives satisfactory results in the hands of experienced operators , but it is giving way to the thermometer with its more accurate indication of temperature . When boiling is complete the toffee is poured on to a slab , cooled and fed to machines which cut and wrap it for sale . CHOCOLATE . The essential ingredients of chocolate are cocoa , cocoabutter and sugar . The cocoa and cocoa-butter are both obtained from cocoa-beans which grow in pods on cocoa trees in tropical countries . The pods are egg-shaped , about eight inches long , and contain twenty to thirty beans embedded in a soft white starchy pulp . The pods are split open and the beans , with adhering pulp , are scraped out and allowed to ferment in a closed container for several days . A yeast fungus grows on the pulp and it liquefies owing to fermentation to alcohol . The liquid formed is allowed to drain away from the beans which during the process , change in colour from their original light violet to dark brown . After drying in the sun the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the manufacture of cocoa and chocolate , the beans are first roasted in revolving drums and are then broken into small pieces by passing through special rollers . At the same time the husk is removed , leaving behind the small pieces of roasted bean which are known as nibs . This roasting process is of great importance because it is at this stage that the characteristic chocolate flavour and aroma develop . The nibs contain about 50 per cent of a fat known as cocoa-butter and during the next operation , in which the nibs are finely ground in mills , the heat generated melts the cocoa-butter to produce a viscous brown liquid as product . When the liquid , which is a dispersion of cocoa in cocoa-butter is cooled , a brown solid known as cocoa-mass is obtained . For the production of cocoa a proportion of the cocoa-butter is squeezed out in powerful hydraulic presses . The residue , containing 20 ? 30 per cent cocoa-butter , is finely ground and sold as cocoa powder . It contains about 2 per cent theobromine and 0.1 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible , at least in part , for the bitterness of cocoa and chocolate . // Chocolate is produced by mixing cocoa-mass with finely powdered sugar and the cocoa-butter expressed from cocoa-mass during the manufacture of cocoa powder . The amount of sugar used is large and plain chocolate may contain 50 per cent sugar . For milk chocolate , milk solids are incorporated , either as dried milk or as full-cream condensed milk . The mixing is carried out in special pieces of equipment known as melangeurs in which massive rollers rotate in contact with a revolving heated plate . On leaving the melangeurs the mixture passes to a refining machine , where it is pinched between rollers revolving at different speeds . To complete the mixing process the molten chocolate is next couched ' for a long period of up to twenty-four hours . In the conching process heavy rollers subject the chocolate to severe mechanical treatment and blend all the ingredients into a uniform velvety mass . The manufacturing process is now complete and it only remains for the chocolate to be moulded into the familiar bars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering centres ' to make individual chocolates or in covering biscuits , contains a larger proportion of cocoa-butter than ordinary block chocolate . The purpose of this is to increase the fluidity of chocolate when warm . Coated chocolate goods are made by passing the centre or biscuit to be coated through a curtain of molten chocolate in a machine called an enrober . Chocolate and cocoa are highly nutritious as is shown by the following average figures : In addition to these main constituents , chocolate also contains useful amounts of calcium , iron , vitamin A and the B vitamins . JAM . Jam is made by boiling fruit with sugar solutions and is essentially a which possesses some of the attributes , such as elasticity , of a solid . In the case of jam the gel is formed from the sugar , the acids present in the fruit , and a polysaccharide // called pectin obtained from the fruit . The amount of pectin in the gel is quite small , usually less than 1 per cent of the weight of the jam . The sugar content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually about 70 per cent . Of the remainder , the bulk is water with a small amount of fibrous matter and seeds . In Great Britain jam must contain not less than 68.5 per cent soluble solids unless packed in hermetically sealed containers in which case it must contain not less than 65 per cent . The quantity of pectin and acid in fruit for jam making is of great importance because gel formation only occurs when the concentrations of sugar and pectin and the pH of the mixture lie within certain limits . Some fruits such as currants , damsons , gooseberries , lemons and bitter oranges are rich in both acid and pectin and can easily be made into jam . Others , such as strawberries , blackberries , raspberries and cherries contain little pectin and some must be added before jam can be made successfully from them . A simple way of doing this is to add another fruit rich in pectin and acid , e.g. apple or a concentrated pectin preparation ( see p. 143 ) . As the percentage of pectin in a jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling . A satisfactory gel is obtained with about 1 per cent pectin although for a given pH and sugar content the firmness of the gel is influenced by the quality ' of the pectin as well as by the quantity present . Pectin is a polysaccharide and its molecules consist of large numbers of simple sugar-like molecules connected together to form a long thread-like molecule . The length of a pectin molecule depends upon its source . During gel formation the long molecules link loosely together to form a three-dimensional network which gives the gel its stability . If the pectin molecules are too short the gel may lack strength and be runny or soft . Anyone who has tried to make jam at home knows that the jam obtained from ripe fruit is not as good as that from fruit which is almost ripe . This is because pectin will not form a satisfactory gel until the pH is lowered to about 3.5 and unripe fruit is usually more acidic than ripe fruit . To decrease the pH of a jam mixture an acidic fruit juice , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citric acid , malic acid or cream of tartar . A low pH during the cooking period may cause inversion of too much sucrose , and also hydrolyse the pectin to some extent . As both these changes are detrimental the pH adjustment is often carried out at the end of the cooking period . When fruit is boiled with sugar a certain amount of inversion occurs and this is of the utmost importance because invert-sugar prevents the crystallization of the sugar in the jam when it is kept . In addition , the presence of invert-sugar increases the amount of sugars ( sucrose , glucose and fructose ) which will remain dissolved in the jam to a level at which // mould growth is impossible . Too much invert-sugar , however , is detrimental because it reduces the strength of the gel and may cause the jam to set to a honey-like mass on keeping . Another reason why fruit used in jam making should not be over-ripe is that proto-pectin , from which pectin is formed during jam making , is present in maximum amount just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when supplies of fresh fruit were available they would be able to work for only a very short period each year . Moreover , the great amount of fruit harvested during these periods would be far too large to be made quickly into jam by the existing number of jam factories . To overcome this difficulty large amounts of preserved fruits are used . The method of preserving the fruit is very simple ; it is kept submerged in a weak solution of sulphur dioxide in water . Fruit can be preserved in this way either before or after cooking . In practice , strawberries , raspberries and blackberries are preserved raw whereas plums , currants and gooseberries are usually preserved as a cooked pulp because sulphur dioxide tends to toughen the skins of the uncooked fruit . The fruit is bleached by the sulphur dioxide during the preserving but the colour returns during the cooking . Almost all the sulphur dioxide is driven off during cooking and the finished jam must not contain more than 100 parts per million . When jam is made at home the fruit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process and the length of the cooking period depends upon the fruit being used . Cooking is complete when a sample of the fruit forms a coherent pectin clot when allowed to stand for a few minutes with several times its volumes of methylated spirit . The clot should be strong enough to withstand pouring from one vessel to another without breaking . When a satisfactory pectin clot is obtained the sugar should be added and the mixture boiled as rapidly as possible . The duration of the boiling period will depend on the fruit used and the size and shape of the pan ; it varies from about five to about twenty minutes . A shallow pan , in which a large surface area of the jam is exposed for evaporation is best because this permits rapid evaporation . The boiling period is usually complete when the temperature of the boiling mixtures reaches 104 ? C. The exact temperature at which boiling should be stopped depends upon the acidity and pectin content of the fruit , however , both of which influence the setting properties of the jam . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately judged by removing a sample and examining its behaviour on cooling . A sample of the jam placed on a cold plate should quickly form a skin which wrinkles on being touched . Alternatively , a sample is allowed to cool on a spoon which is then tilted so that the jam drops off . If the jam // runs ' in a continuous liquid stream , boiling is incomplete and should be continued . Jam which has been sufficiently boiled should leave the spoon in discrete flakes which break away cleanly from each other . Jam making on a large scale is carried out in a much more scientific way than this . To begin with , the recipe is adjusted to give the correct amounts of sugar and pectin with the particular fruit being used and pH is also carefully controlled . Pre-cooked pulp is often used and the boiling is usually carried out in open pans holding about 180 litres of jam . The boiling time is very short and seldom exceeds ten minutes . This short boiling time preserves the gel-forming properties of the pectin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent and 40 per cent . The time of boiling and hence the amount of invert-sugar formed can be controlled by altering the amount of water used . With too little invert-sugar , sucrose may crystallize , whereas with too much the gel obtained may be weak or the invert-sugar itself may crystallize as a pasty , honey-like mass . The end of the boil can be judged as in home jam-making , from the behaviour of a sample of the jam taken on a shallow spoon or skimmer ' and allowed to drip off . It can also be estimated from the boiling point of the solution ; when this reaches 104 ? 106 ? C the end of the boiling period is imminent . The boiling point is really an indication of the strength of the solution being boiled and this can be more accurately determined by means of a refractometer which measures the refractive index of the solution . From a knowledge of the refractive index the concentration of soluble solids in the solution can be accurately calculated . The soluble solids are added sugar and pectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit . The soluble solids content aimed at varies from maker to maker but is usually about 70 per cent . After boiling , the jam must be cooled as quickly as possible to prevent inversion continuing . After bottling , a waxed-paper disc is placed on the jam to prevent condensation of water on its surface . This would dissolve some of the sugar from the jam and produce an area of low sugar concentration conducive to mould growth . If the jars are hermetically sealed with a metal cover , or if the jam is canned , the waxed disc is not necessary because mould growth can not occur in such containers . // Chapter Eight Carbohydrates 2 Polysaccharides Polysaccharides are carbohydrates of high molecular weight which differ from the sugars in being non-crystalline , generally insoluble in water and tasteless . A polysaccharide is built up from a large number of connected monosaccharide units which may be alike or different . As in the case of disaccharides one molecule of water is lost in the union between one monosaccharide molecule and the next . The polysac charides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from monosaccharides containing six carbon atoms and are best formulated ( C6H1005 ) n . The value of n varies , but in most cases is quite large . A single cellulose molecule for example can contain several thousand connected glucose units . Hydrolysis breaks down a polysaccharide molecule into smaller portions containing various numbers of monosac charide units and may , if sufficiently drastic , convert the polysaccharide completely to monosaccharide : Like the sugars , polysaccharides are built up by plants from carbon dioxide and water and it is probable that the sugars represent an intermediate stage in the photosynthesis of polysaccharides . It has already been mentioned that animals are unable to build up carbohyd rates by photosynthesis and for this reason polysaccharides are found predominantly in plants . The polysaccharide glycogen , however , is elaborated by man from glucose , and several similar examples of animals synthesizing polysaccharides from monosaccharides are known . In man , glycogen constitutes a store of carbohydrate , starch performs a similar function in plants and glycogen is sometimes called animal starch . In plants , polysaccharides also serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cellulose Cellulose is the chief structural carbohydrate of plants and , as such , is very widely distributed . All forms of plant life , from the toughest treeCARBOHYDRATES // trunk to the softest cotton-wool , contain cellulose and indeed the latter is almost pure cellulose . Whatever its origin the constitution of cellulose is the same . Because it is so widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom , cellulose is found , to a greater or lesser extent , in all foods of vegetable origin . It can not be digested by man and most carnivorous animals because the enzymes present in their stomachs can not rupture the /3-1,4 link between the glucose units . For this reason cellulose has no nutritional value although it may serve a useful purpose as roughage . Much cellulose is removed in the processing of food ; for example the husks of cereal grains , which are mainly cellulose , are usually removed . Cellulose can be digested by horses and by ruminants such as cows . The latter have auxiliary stomachs containing micro-organisms which produce enzymes capable of hydrolysing cellulose to glucose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulphuric acid . The only monosaccharide obtained in this process is Dglucose . It has been shown that the glucose units in cellulose are /3-glucose which are connected together to form very large , chain-like molecules . The link between the glucose units is from carbon atom 1 in one unit to carbon atom 4 in another as shown in Fig. 8.1 The number of glucose units connected in this way to form a cellulose molecule varies with the origin of the cellulose , but it is always large and may amount to several thousand . Bundles of chains lying side by side are linked together to give cellulose fibres . Starch Starch is the chief food reserve of plants and is converted , as required , into sugars . It may be stored in the stems as in the sago palm , in the tubers as in potatoes or cassava , from which tapioca is made . Unripe fruits contain appreciable amounts of starch which is converted to glucose as the fruit ripens . It is especially abundant in seeds such as cereal grains and the pulses . On microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consist of small granules , the shape and size of which are // peculiar to the plant from which they have been obtained . The size of starch granules measured along their longest axis varies from 0.0002 cm to 0.015 cm . Particles of this size can not be seen by the naked eye but are clearly visible on microscopic examination . Potato starch granules are among the largest and rice starch among the smallest . The granules of a particular type of starch need not all be of one size . In potato starch , for instance , the granules vary in size from 0.0015 cm to 0.01 cm . The size of the starch granules may influence the properties of the starch because large granules gelatinize more easily than small granules . It is difficult to generalize concerning the shape of starch granules but those from cereals such as maize or rice are angular , while spherical or ellipsoidal granules are characteristic of tuber and root starches such as tapioca , sago and potato starch . Starch does not dissolve in cold water and it was formerly thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellulose envelope . It is now believed that the resistance to water is due to closer and more orderly packing of the starch particles at the surface of the granule than in its interior . If a suspension of starch in water is heated , water diffuses through the walls of the granules and causes swelling . This begins at about 60 ? C and by about 85 ? C the volume of the granules has increased by about five times and the starch sol is very viscous ; a process known as gelatinization . Such a sol will set into a gel on cooling if sufficiently concentrated . Uncooked starchy foods are not easy to digest because the starch granules are contained within the cell walls of the plant which the digestive juices are unable to penetrate . Cooking serves to gelatinize the starch granules ; it also softens the cellulose of the cell walls and makes the pectin more soluble ( see Fig. 8.2 on page 141 ) . Glucose is the only monosaccharide obtained on hydrolysis of starch . It was first thought that starch was composed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only difference between the two being that the glucose units in cellulose were the a-isomer and in starch the fiisomer . It is now known , however , that starch is a mixture of two substances called amylose and amylopectin . Both of these are polysaccharides and there is usually about four times as much amylopectin as amylose . Amylose is responsible for the blue colour produced when starch reacts with iodine . It can be separated from amylopectin by formation of an insoluble complex with a suitable liquid such as butyl alcohol . The enzyme fi-amylase , which is present in cereals , hydrolyses amylose almost completely to maltose . Amylopectin , on the other hand , gives a reddish-brown colour with iodine and only about half of it is converted // into maltose by /3-amylase , the residue being referred to as a dextrin . Glucose syrup ( p. 122 ) contains considerable quantities of dextrins , which are produced by incomplete hydrolysis of starchy materials . When dry starch is heated so-called pyro-dextrins are formed . These are brown in colour and soluble in water . Toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyro-dextrins . The molecular weight of amylose varies from about 10000 to about 50000 and this corresponds to 70 ? 350 glucose units . The glucose units are connected in a 1 ? 4 manner to form a chain as in cellulose . Maltose is the only disaccharide obtained when amylose is hydrolysed and this shows that the glucose units are the a-isomer and not the /3-isomer as in cellulose . The structure of amylopectin is not as simple as that of amylose . To begin with the molecule is larger and may contain as many as 100 000 glucose units . It consists of a large number of comparatively short interconnected chains of glucose units . A portion of an amylopectin molecule can be represented diagrammatically as in Fig. 8.4 ( p. 142 ) . In this diagram each hexagon represents a glucose unit and AB and DE are the short chains of about 24 glucose units connected at BC and EF . The links connecting the chains are from the reducing group at the end // In a single amylopectin molecule there are large numbers of these chains each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of the starch . In the diagram above , only one branch ' has been shown originating from each chain of glucose units . Most chains have more than one branching point , however , and a most complex threedimensional structure can result . Now that we know something of the structure of amylopectin it is possible to understand why /3-amylase can only convert about half of it into maltose . The reason is that amylase splits off pairs of glucose units , in the form of maltose , from the free end of the chains of glucose units in the amylopectin molecule ( i.e. the left-hand end in Fig. 8.4 ) . When the chain has been degraded as far as a branching point the amylase is unable to split off further pairs of glucose units and the product is referred to as a /3-limit-dextrin . In addition to amylose and amylopectin , starch may contain small amounts of non-carbohydrate material such as phosphates and fats . The amount and composition of this extraneous material depend upon the of one chain to a primary alcohol group on another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above diagram enclosed in a broken line is shown in detail in Fie . 8.5. // source of the starch . Potato starch and wheat starch each contain about 0.5 per cent non-carbohydrate material and phosphates predominate : wheat starch , on the other hand , contains about 0.75 per cent made up largely of fats . Pectin Pectin is the name given to a mixture of polysaccharides found in fruits and some roots , which is responsible for the formation of gels in jam manufacture . Pectin can be isolated from fruits by extraction with hot dilute acids . Non-carbohydrate materials are extracted at the same time but the pectin can be separated from them by adding alcohol , which precipitates it . Pectins from various sources differ considerably in composition but all of them contain methyl pectate , and two other complex polysaccharides called araban and galactan , which do not contribute to the gelforming properties . The methyl pectate is responsible for the gelforming properties of pectin : it consists of a chain of repeating esterified a-D-galacturonic acid units as shown in Fig. 8.6 although not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esterified acid residues may be present in a single molecule of methyl pectate . Concentrated pectin extracts can be bought for use in jam making ( see p. 133 ) . They are made either from citrus fruit residues or from the pulp remaining after the expression of juice from apples . The pectin is extracted by pressure cooking with water or very dilute acid . The extract is filtered , vacuum concentrated , and the pectin precipitated by adding alcohol . Glycogen This is the reserve carbohydrate of man and other animals . Glycogen has a molecular weight of 5 000 000 or greater . It differs from starch in being soluble in water and giving a reddish colour , not blue , with iodine . On hydrolysis the only monosaccharide obtained is glucose . The enzyme // /3-amylase converts glycogen to maltose in about 50 per cent yield and this is reminiscent of amylopectin . The structure of glycogen resembles that of amylopectin closely , but the repeating chains are much shorter and contain only 12 glucose units compared with 20 ? 30 in amylopectin . IMPORTANT CARBOHYDRATE FOODSTUFFS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large quantities of carbohydrate ( expressed as monosaccharide ) : The most important cereals are wheat , oats , barley , rye , rice and maize . All cereals are cultivated grasses and the cereal grain is really the seed of the grass . Contained within the grain is a rich store of nutrients for the grass which should grow from it . Civilized societies in all parts of the world depend upon cereals for nourishment because they produce the maximum yield of food from a given area of ground . The cereal grains are obtained by threshing the harvested grass ' to separate the grain from the chaff , which surrounds each grain , and the stalk which supports the ear . It is clear from Fig. 8.7 that cereals are principally sources of carbohydrate . In addition , however , they contain substantial amounts // of protein ( from about 6 per cent in rice to about 12 per cent in oats and Canadian wheat ) and because large quantities of cereal products are eaten this may constitute quite a large proportion of the total protein intake . Fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent in wheat to about 5 per cent in oats ) . Cereal grains contain substantial amounts of vitamins of the B group though , as will become evident in the sequel , the quantity of these vitamins present in foods manufactured from cereals depends largely upon the degree to which the several parts of the grain have been separated in milling . The amount of moisture in cereal grains is quite small ( from 7 per cent in oats to about 12 per cent in wheat ) and this largely accounts for their good keeping qualities . In the vegetable family the chief sources of carbohydrate are potatoes and the pulses such as peas , beans and lentils which are the seeds of leguminous plants . Wheat Wheat is by far the most important cereal as far as people in Great Britain are concerned . It was first grown in the Middle East but in the course of centuries its cultivation has spread and varieties of wheat suitable for cultivation in zones as climatically different as the tropics and the North European areas bordering on the Arctic Circle are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , are sown in the autumn and harvested in the following August but spring wheat , which is sown and harvested in the same year , is grown in countries such as Canada , where the winters are severe . Winter wheat , such as English wheat , usually contains less than 10 per cent protein and gives a weak dough which bakes into small close-textured loaves . Flour from such wheat is said to be soft . Spring wheat , such as Canadian wheat , on the other hand , is rich in proteins and gives a strong flour from which a strong elastic dough can be made . Strong flours give doughs which produce bold well-risen loaves and they are very suitable for breadmaking . English flour and other similar soft ' flours are more suitable for the manufacture of cakes and biscuits and for household use . Flour used for breadmaking in this country is usually a blend of the two types . Durum wheat , which is used for making macaroni and spaghetti is a particularly hard wheat of high protein content . THE STRUCTURE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one centimetre long and half a centimetre broad . It is egg-shaped with a deep fissure or crease running along one side and a number of small hairs , called the beard , at one end . The grain is enclosed in an outer covering called bran which consists of several distinct layers and // constitutes about 15 per cent of the whole wheat . Bran contains a high proportion of B vitamins and about 50 per cent of the mineral elements present in the grain . Unfortunately bran consists largely of cellulose and hence is indigestible by humans . It is separated from the remainder of the grain during the production of flour ( see below ) and is used mainly for animal foods . The germ , which is situated at the base of the grain , is the actual seed or embryo and constitutes about 20 per cent of the whole grain . It is rich in fats , protein , vitamins of the B group , vitamin E and iron . The combined fatty acids present in the fats are mainly essential fatty acids . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endosperm ; it is exceedingly rich in the vitamin thiamine and contains about 60 per cent of all the thiamine present in the grain . The endosperm is mainly starch and is intended as a reserve of food for the germ . It is by far the largest component and makes up about 80 ? 90 per cent of the wheat grain . The starch granules are embedded in a matrix of protein and the periphery of the endosperm is composed of a single layer of cells called the aleurone layer . This layer contains a higher proportion of proteins than the endosperm as a whole , but un fortunately it is removed with the bran during the milling of the wheat . So many varieties of wheat are grown and climatic and other conditions are so variable that it is not possible to give precise figures for the composition of wheat . The figures given in Fig. 8.8 represent an average value . // FLOUR MILLING . Wheat grains are almost always reduced to flour before being eaten and this operation is known as flour milling . Archaeological evidence shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 400 B.C. and in later times windmills or water mills were used in which the wheat was ground between two circular grooved stones the upper of which revolved while the lower stone remained stationary . The wheat was fed into the centre through a hole in the upper stone and was ground into flour during its passage to the periphery of the stones . In this process all the wheat grain was ground up so that the flour produced , called wholemeal flour , contained the germ , bran and scutellum as well as the powdered endosperm . Wholemeal flour is dark in colour and bread produced from it may be rather coarse , depending upon the extent to which the bran particles have been reduced in size . Modern milling processes differ greatly from the age-old method just described . The milling is carried out using steel rollers in place of revolving flat stones and the germ , bran and scutellum are removed so that the flour produced consists essentially of powdered endosperm . The process is very complex but in essence it consists in separating the endosperm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the endosperm particles by passing them through a series of steel rollers as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 8.9 . Before milling , different varieties of wheat may be blended together so that the flour obtained from the blend is best suited to the purpose for which it is intended . After blending , the wheat is passed through a series of ingenious machines which remove stones , weed seeds and other extraneous materials , and may then be washed and brushed to remove adhering dirt . Imported wheat is often too dry to be milled directly , and it must be conditioned ' or brought to the optimum moisture content for milling . This can be done by storing the wheat in a moist condition for one or more days . The conditioning can be speeded up by passing the moist wheat through a machine known as a conditioner , in which it is heated to a temperature of 40 ? 50 ? C for thirty to ninety minutes . Alternatively the wheat may be exposed to live steam for a minute or so , followed by rapid cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moisture through the grain becomes more uniform , the bran becoming tougher and the endosperm more friable . This makes easier the separation of endosperm and germ from the bran in the milling operations which follow . English wheat often contains more water than is desirable , and when this is so it must be dried before milling . The conversion of grain to flour begins with the operation known as breaking , in which the grain , or grist as it is known , is passed through four or five pairs of rolls known as break rolls . These rolls , which are // made of steel , are corrugated and rotate at different speeds . The corrugations , which are arranged in a spiral fashion , break grain apart at the crease and scrape away the endosperm from the bran . After passing through the first break rolls the wheat is sieved through silk or fine wire gauze and separated into a small quantity of flour , known as first break flour , small particles of endosperm known as middlings ' or semolina ' and coarser particles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endosperm is passed on to the next set of break rolls . Each pair of break rolls is set closer together and has finer corrugations than the one before it and the branny residue from the final sifting is extremely thin with little or no attached endosperm . The middlings produced at each set of break rolls are graded ' or sized by further sieving in machines known as purifiers . These consist of enclosed reciprocating sieves through which a current of air is blown . The blowing removes particles of endosperm which are still attached to the bran , and these are treated in a separate part of the mill where the endosperm is scraped away from the bran by finely corrugated rolls similar to break rolls . The graded semolina and middlings are converted to flour by a series of smooth rolls called reduction rolls . There are usually from ten to fifteen sets of reduction rolls and as with the break rolls , the clearance between the rolls decreases from one set of rolls to the next . The reduction rolls crack the semolina particles and gradually produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the endosperm were simply crushed to a fine powder by being passed through a pair of rolls set very closely together the starch granules would be badly damaged and the resulting flour would be of very poor quality . The product from each set of reduction rolls is sieved to remove the flour , and the residue is divided into two parts ; the finer of these two fractions is sent to one of the succeeding reduction rolls , and the less fine is sent back down the reduction system . The germ is not friable and so it is flattened rather than powdered by the reduction rolls , and is easily separated in the sifting operations . Flour streams ' are obtained at each of the break rolls and reduction rolls and these differ markedly in composition . They may be mixed in various proportions to give flour suitable for special purposes , or they may all be combined to give what is known as a straight-run flour . The milling technique described above can be modified to produce more or less flour from a given amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraction rate of the flour . Wholemeal flour , which contains all the bran , germ and scutellum and endosperm of the wheat grain has an extraction rate of 100 per cent . An extraction rate of // 70 per cent , on the other hand , produces flour which is composed almost exclusively of crushed endosperm . SPECIAL FLOURS . High and low protein flours . The starch particles present in a sample of ordinary flour vary in size from below 5 microns to about 12 microns in diameter ( 1 micron = 10- 6 m ) . The larger particles , of diameter greater than about 35 microns , consist of starch granules embedded in a protein matrix . Particles of size between 17 and 35 microns are , in the main , free starch granules and little protein matrix is present . Below about 17 microns the particles are mainly small starch granules , fragments of free protein and small particles of protein matrix with adherent fragments of starch . If flour is subjected to a further sizereducing process in an impact mill many of the larger particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and more separate starch granules and protein fragments released . By separating the flour produced into three fractions it is possible to obtain two highprotein flours and one low-protein flour as shown in Table 8.1 . Because the sizes of the flour particles are so small it is not possible to separate the fractions by conventional sieving operations , but this can be done by using a piece of equipment known as an air classifier . In the classifier flour particles in air are subjected to powerful centrifugal forces by being made to follow a spiral path at high speeds and at the same time , of course , each particle is experiencing frictional drag . The centrifugal force on each particle is proportional to its weight whereas frictional resistance varies with particle size and not with weight . Because of this difference the coarser particles migrate to the outside of the spiral path and finer particles accumulate in the centre . The fraction of largest particle size is noticeably coarser , because of the absence of fine particles , than normal flour and it has been used for biscuitmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable as a high-ratio cake flour ( see p. 102 ) because of its fine and even particle size . // Enzyme-inactivated Flour . Wheat contains amylases and if the wheat has begun to sprout , as it may do if harvested under damp conditions , the a-amylase content may be relatively high . When a dough made from such flour is kept , considerable starch breakdown occurs and a sticky dough may be produced . In the case of flours for use in gravies , thickening agents , and powdered soups a high a-amylase content may be particularly undesirable because if the gravy or soup is made and kept hot the a-amylase may break down the starch to such an extent that it is no longer able to act as a thickening agent . Enzyme-inactivated flour is now available for special purposes such as this and it is made from wheat which has been steam treated so that its temperature reaches 100 ? C. The wheat is subsequently dried and converted into flour in the usual way . Enzyme-inactivated flour is not suitable for breadmaking because the elastic properties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flour . When ordinary flour is added to water the particles float on the surface and tend to stick together to form lumps which are difficult to disperse . An instant ' flour which is easily wetted by water and can be dispersed in water without difficulty is manufactured by allowing flour to fall through jets of steam . The outer surfaces of the flour particles are wetted and if they are then allowed to fall through cold jets of air the particles stick together or agglomerate . The moisture content of the clusters is adjusted by passing the flour through heated chambers and oversize particles are reduced to a uniform particle size . As well as being easily dispersible in water , agglomerated flour , or instant flour , is free flowing and dust free because it consists of small clusters of flour particles above 100 microns in diameter . When agglomerated flour is added to water the clusters are penetrated by water as a result of capillary action and the wetted particles sink . Agglomerated flour is especially useful in soup and gravy powders or as a thickening agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in convenience foods . FLOUR IMPROVERS . It was formerly the practice to store flour for several weeks after milling before it was used for breadmaking . During this period its breadmaking characteristics improved , as a result of the action of atmospheric oxygen on the proteins which form gluten during doughmaking . The gluten obtained from aged ' flour is stronger and more elastic than that obtained from freshly milled flour . It has been discovered that this ageing period can be dispensed with if the flour is treated with a minute quantity of one of a number of oxidizing agents which are called flour improvers . It is now common practice to treat all // flours with one of these improvers . Some of the compounds employed as flour improvers and the proportions in which they are used are listed in Table 8.2 below . The first four of the improvers listed increase the whiteness of the flour by bleaching the carotene and xanthophyll , which are always present and give the flour a slight yellow tinge . When other improvers are used the miller may also employ a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired change of colour . The way in which improvers perform their functions is not fully understood though many theories have been advanced to explain it . It is possible , however , that the improvers produce some cross-linking between adjacent protein molecules by the formation of disulphide links from neighbouring sulphydryl ( ? SH ) groups as shown in Fig. 8.10 . The // sulphydryl groups belong to the amino acid cysteine which forms part of some protein molecules ( see Chapter 9 and Table 9.1 ) . The increase in molecular weight and molecular complexity produced by such a process of cross-linking would be expected to produce a corresponding increase in the strength and elasticity of the gluten formed on treatment with water . This , of course , is the characteristic effect produced by flour improvers . THE ENZYMES OF FLOUR . Wheat flour contains a- and /3-amylases which are capable of hydrolysing the amylose and amylopectin of starch . The hydrolysis does not occur to any significant extent in dry flour but begins immediately a dough is made . /3-amylase attacks the damaged starch grains inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amylose to maltose . It can also hydrolyse amylopectin and produce maltose by splitting off pairs of glucose units from the ends of the chains . With amylopectin , only the free ' ends of the chains can be attacked and hydrolysis ceases before the glucose unit which connects two chains together is reached . The links between the chains can not be hydrolysed by /3-amylase and a high molecular weight dextrin , which is not susceptible to further attack by /3-amylase , is ultimately obtained . aAmylase , which is present in flour made from sprouting wheat , attacks amylopectin in an entirely different way ; it splits the links between the chains to produce low molecular weight dextrins . These dextrins differ in structure , as well as in size , from those produced by /3-amylase . They consist , like amylose , of strings of connected glucose units whereas the dextrins produced by /3-amylose are branched and three-dimensional like amylopectin . The dextrins produced by a-amylase can be hydrolysed to maltose by /3-amylase . Conversely , a-amylase can attack the dextrins produced by /3-amylase to produce simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , by acting in conjunction , a- and /3-amylase can produce a far greater quantity of maltose than either acting alone . The presence of much a-amylase in flour can have a disastrous effect when it is made into bread : the low molecular weight dextrins present cause marked crumb-stickiness and may lead to collapse of the loaf . a-Amylase is active up to about 60 ? C and so its action may continue for some time after the bread has been put in the oven . Flour also contains peptidases and it is believed that these play a part in the ripening ' of the dough . Peptidases also make available much aand /3-amylase which is combined with protein and would otherwise be unavailable . Lipases and lipoxidases also occur in flour and act upon the fats present . Lipases catalyse the hydrolysis of fats to glycerol and fatty // acids whereas lipoxidases catalyse oxidation . Flour which has been stored for a long period may have a tallowy smell and flavour owing to the presence of oxidation product of fats . Phytase is another important enzyme present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see p. 162 ) and is active during the fermentation and early stages of baking . Breadmaking A type of bread , known as unleavened bread , can be made by mixing flour with water and then baking it . Historically this is the forerunner of modern bread , but the product is hard and unattractive to most palates and the resemblance to bread , as we know it , is slight . Bread is made from flour , water , salt and yeast . It has a honeycomb structure and may be regarded as a solid foam ( see Table 6.3 ) with a multitude of pockets of carbon dioxide distributed uniformly through-out its bulk . Sugars naturally present in flour and the maltose made available by the action of amylases , are hydrolysed to glucose and this is fermented by zymase present in the yeast . Alcohol and carbon dioxide are formed and the latter aerates the dough . The reactions concerned are identical with those discussed on page 60 . They are summarized below : Most of the alcohol formed during fermentation is driven off during baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily from bakeries . In all , about 7 per cent of the nutrients originally present in the dough are lost as a result of the fermentation process . Small amounts of carboxylic acids are produced during the fermen tation period as well as carbon dioxide and alcohol . The acids formed lower the pH of the dough and this affects the colloidal state of the gluten ( see below ) and assists in ripening the dough . The carbon dioxide retained by the dough also lowers the pH and so , in addition to its leavening function , it has a beneficial effect on the gluten structure . Some protein breakdown occurs during the fermentation period owing to the presence of proteolytic enzymes . During this period the yeast cells multiply and the yeast contributes substantially , together with the fermentation products , to the flavour of the loaf . Two of the proteins present in flour ? gliadin and glutenin ? become hydrated and form an elastic complex called gluten when flour is kneaded with water . It is the presence of this elastic gluten which makes the manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contains the carbon dioxide within the loaf and prevents its escape . The gluten is uniformly distributed throughout the dough and // the carbon dioxide becomes trapped as small pockets of gas . As gas production continues the gluten strands are stretched and it is thought that bonds between adjacent protein molecules are broken and reformed to produce an elastic gas-retaining three-dimensional network . A ripe dough , that is one which is ready for baking , is springy and elastic and it can be fairly easily stretched out and shows a capacity to recover its former shape . An under-ripe dough is extensible , i.e. it can be stretched , but lacks elasticity . If fermentation is allowed to continue unhindered the dough becomes over-ripe and , as dough in this condition can not be stretched far without breaking , its power to retain carbon dioxide is lost . The salt used in doughmaking influences the rate at which fermentation takes place and enables the baker to control the development of the dough . In addition , it has a strengthening and toughening action on the gluten , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in the absence of salt , would cause a certain amount of degradation of the gluten . The third and most important function of the salt is to improve the flavour of the bread which , without it , has a flat insipid taste . The weight of salt added is about 2 per cent of the weight of flour used , although this figure varies slightly , more salt being used in the North of England than in the South . The amount of water needed to make a dough varies with the quality of the flour , but it is roughly half the weight of the flour used . Its temperature must be adjusted so that the fermented dough has a temperature of 24-27 ? C. The quantity of yeast needed depends upon the time and temperature of fermentation but is usually about 0.3 - 1.0 per cent of the weight of the flour used . When bread is baked the carbon dioxide expands , the starch gelatinizes , and the gluten coagulates to produce a more or less rigid loaf . The changes which occur during baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fermentation . In the traditional method of breadmaking all the ingredients are mixed together to form a dough which is allowed to ferment for a period . This is referred to as bulk fermentation . Several techniques of doughmaking are employed ; in some cases a sponge ' or very fluid dough made from some of the yeast , salt , water and about a quarter of the flour is allowed to ferment overnight before being added to the main bulk of the ingredients for a further shorter period of fermentation . The straight dough ' technique is probably the most important method of bulk fermentation used in England , however . A typical recipe would be as follows : flour , 127 kg ( i.e. 1 sack ) ; yeast , 1.36 kg ; salt , 2.27 kg ; fat , 0.91 kg ; water , 72.6 kg ( i.e. 72 litres ) . The yeast is suspended in a little of the water and all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed by a mechanical mixer until a homogeneous dough is obtained . // This is covered to prevent the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of one hour or longer depending upon the quantity of yeast used and the temperature of the dough . Yeast functions best in doughmaking at a temperature of about 26 ? C and the dough should preferably be kept at or about this temperature . The dough is then thoroughly kneaded or knocked back ' to expel some of the carbon dioxide and tighten up the dough . This has the effect of bringing yeast cells into contact with a new environment and assists further fermentation . The dough is then covered again and allowed to ferment for a further period usually about two and a half hours but , as before , this depends upon the amount of yeast used and the ambient temperature ? at the end of which it is divided into pieces of the required weight which are shaped into balls . A good deal of carbon dioxide is lost during the dividing and moulding process and the dough is given a further period of fermentation referred to as first proof or intermediate proof to allow more carbon dioxide to be formed . During this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received during dividing and shaping . After the first proving period of 10 ? 15 minutes is over the dough is moulded to its final shape and after placing in baking tins , or on baking sheets , is given a final proof of about fortyfive minutes at a somewhat higher temperature ( usually 32 ? 35 ? C ) during which it becomes fully inflated with carbon dioxide and assumes its final shape . In a modern bakery the mixing , knocking back , dividing and moulding to shape are carried out mechanically and the proving periods are often spent on conveyor belts passing through temperature controlled chambers . Because of the fairly long fermentation period , however , a considerable weight of dough is being dealt with at any one time in a large bakery and this has to be man-handled from place to place and , of course , it occupies considerable space . In modern bread-making methods the fermentation period is replaced by a short period of intensive mixing ( see below ) and this overcomes one of the main drawbacks of the traditional breadmaking process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if freshlymixed dough is subjected to a short period of very intensive mixing the bulk fermentation period may be omitted . During this process of mechanical development ' the mixing machine rapidly stretches the protein fibres of the gluten and this replaces the stretching brought about by gas evolution in the bulk fermentation process . It is thought that bonds between adjacent protein units are ruptured during the mechanical treatment and this is followed by a rapid redisposition of the // protein molecules . At this point mechanical work must cease and a period of re-formation of chemical bonds takes place to give the required network structure . If mixing is continued beyond this point an inferior product results . It has been found by experiment that the optimum amount of development is that produced by the expenditure of about 0.14 kilowatt minutes per kg of dough or , expressing this in electrical units of work , 11 watt hours per kg . This is about five to eight times the amount of energy used in a normal breadmaking process . Yeast is still used in mechanically developed doughmaking although one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres ? is done mechanically . The yeast is still required for producing carbon dioxide , which aerates the bread in the usual way , and for flavouring . There are a number of methods of making mechanically developed dough but one process which has become important is that developed at the British Baking Industries Research Association at Chorleywood which has become known as the Chorleywood bread process . In this method a normal breadmaking recipe can be used except that somewhat more yeast and water than usual are required ( about 2.3 kg of yeast are required per sack of flour compared with about 14 kg for bulk fermentation and about 7 per cent more water ) . Ascorbic acid and fat must also be present . Ascorbic acid is perhaps more familiar as vitamin C but it is used here as an oxidizing agent or improver , and not as a vitamin supplement . It may be worth pointing out that ascorbic acid itself is a reducing agent but in the dough it is enzymically oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid ( see p. 246 ) and it is this which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ascorbic acid are required and this is about 10 g per sack of flour . The inclusion of about 0.9 kg of fat per sack of flour is essential and this should preferably be a high melting point fat . Almost any flour can be used in the Chorleywood process and good bread can be obtained from weak flour . This means that English flour may be used , whereas for the normal bulk fermentation methods the use of a strong flour is necessary . The reason for this is that a certain amount of protein is lost during the bulk fermentation period and this does not occur to any extent with mechanically developed doughs . The fact that there is little or no nutrient loss is important to the baker for economic reasons and it also explains why more water must be used when mixing a mechanically developed dough . The water content of the final product the baked loaf is the same as usual . Control of temperature is less important in the Chorleywood process than in bulk fermentation methods and good results can be obtained throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy expended during develo FOOD SCIENCE ? A CHEMICAL APPROACH ment of the dough its temperature may increase by 11 ? 14 " C during the process . The ingredients for the dough are fed into a powerful mixing machine which is equipped with a meter to indicate how much energy is expanded during the development period . The mixing and development are completed in as short a time as possible usually about five minutes and when the appropriate amount of energy has been expended the machine switches off . The dough is then divided into pieces of the correct weight for the loaves required and these are shaped into balls and given a first proof period of six to ten minutes before being moulded to shape and being placed in baking tins . After a second proving period of about fifty to sixty minutes the bread is ready for baking in the normal way . The advantages of the Chorleywood bread process compared with a normal bulk fermentation process are summarized in Table 8.3 . Changes during Baking . Bread is baked at a temperature of about 232'C for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of bread and the size of the loaf . During baking , the dough first rises rapidly because the pockets of carbon dioxide in the loaf expand as the temperature increases . At first there may also be some slight increase in the activity of the yeast , resulting in increased production of gas , but this diminishes as the temperature increases , until at a temperature of about 54 ? C the yeast is killed and fermentation ceases . As the temperature increases , the water present causes the starch granules to swell and gelatinize , and during this period the starch probably abstracts some water from the gluten . Hot gluten is soft and devoid of its characteristic elasticity , and gelatinized starch now supports the structure of the loaf . The gluten begins to coagulate at about 74 ? C and the coagulation continues slowly to the end of the baking period . The temperature of the interior of the loaf never exceeds the boiling point of water , in spite of the high temperature of the oven . Water and much of the carbon dioxide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dextrin formation occurs at the outside of the loaf as a // result of the action of heat and steam on the starch ; the sugars formed are converted to caramel which imparts an attractive brown colour to the crust . Bread Quality . A loaf of bread has certain characteristics by which its quality is judged . The dough should rise to produce an upstanding loaf , the interior of which should be uniform in porosity and firm and elastic in consistence . The crust should be golden-brown in colour and should be crisp and brittle rather than tough , because this would make it difficult to cut and chew . A dough which has been insufficiently fermented will give a starch gel which is too stiff to permit expansion and a small , dense loaf will result . In a dough which has been overfermented , starch breakdown will have occurred to such an extent that the strength of the starch gel is reduced to a point where it is unable to stand the increased internal gas pressure which occurs during baking . Individual gas cells will coalesce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the loaf from rising properly . In addition , such a loaf will contain larger quantities of dextrins than are found in a properly fermented loaf , and this will cause the interior of the loaf to be darker in colour . It is common knowledge that when bread is kept it becomes stale . The crust becomes soft and leathery and it loses its appealing flavour . This is due largely to the diffusion of water from the interior of the loaf to the crust . Such crust-staling ' occurs more rapidly with wrapped bread than with unwrapped because the moisture is unable to escape . At the same time the interior of the loaf becomes stale and this crumb-staling is associated with loss of water and is characterized by a hardening of the crumb structure and deterioration of flavour . Crumb-staling is not due entirely to loss of moisture and it has been known for over a hundred years that bread stales even when kept in conditions which preclude loss of moisture . Such stale bread which has retained its moisture can be made fresh again by heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This heating process can often be applied with advantage to bread and other flour products which have become stale under ordinary conditions though it is ineffective in producing freshness if the moisture content has fallen below 30 per cent . It is now known that crumb-staling is caused by a change in the nature of the amylopectin in the bread from an amorphous , partly gelatinized , form to a more crystalline modification . During this process the amylopectin molecules become more closely oriented and aggregated as a result of hydrogen bonding . To put this more simply we may say that in fresh bread the amylopectin molecules , and the chains of glucose units // of which they are built up , are arranged in a completely haphazard and random manner in partially swollen starch granules . In stale bread , on the other hand , many amylopectin molecules may be arranged in a cluster and the chains of glucose units lie parallel to each other almost as if they had been combed into position . The presence and absence of order in stale and fresh bread respectively has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gelatinized starch to the more or less crystalline form , water is released and is absorbed by the gluten and crust . Staling can be prevented by drying , because bread containing less than about 16 per cent moisture does not stale . Surprisingly , excess moisture can also prevent staling and wet bread remains fresh for long periods . Neither of these methods is of any practical importance , however . Temperature can play an important part and bread kept under controlled moisture conditions remains fresh above 60 ? C and below  --  10 ? C. At temperatures between these extremes bread becomes stale with a maximum rate of staling at about 0 ? C. This discovery has been put to practical use in the preservation of bread and sponge-cakes ( which normally stale in the same way as bread ) by deep-freezing . It has long been recognized that wrapped bread stays fresh longer than unwrapped , although crust staleness may develop more quickly . This is undoubtedly due to moisture retention which prolongs the period for which the crumb remains soft . Another method of delaying staling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not yet clear how these substances delay the onset of staling . The use of emulsifying agents in bread is controlled by the Bread and Flour Regulations , 1963 , and only stearyl tartrate or partial glycerol esters , such as glyceryl monostearate , may be used for this purpose . Types of Bread . Table 8.4 summarizes those sections of the Bread and Flour Regulations ( 1963 ) which define the main types , of bread offered for sale in Great Britain . The percentages quoted are calculated by weight on the dry matter of the bread . // per cent extraction rate , contains approximately 54 per cent carbohydrate , 8 per cent protein and 1.7 per cent fat . As far as these nutrients are concerned the composition of bread is similar to that of the flour from which it is made if allowance is made for the difference in water content . Like all other foods produced from cereals , bread is eaten primarily as a cheap source of energy , but it also contains valuable // amounts of protein , iron and vitamins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an energy value of about 1070 kg/100 g . A small white loaf will provide 4777 kJ ; this is a considerable fraction of the 12 000 kJ required daily by a moderately active man . A pound loaf also contains over 38 g of protein , which is nearly half the recommended daily allowance for a moderately active man . Because the nutrients in wheat grains are not present in the same proportions in all parts of the grain , a change in the extraction rate produces a change in the composition of the flour obtained . In particular , flour of low extraction rate contains less thiamine and mineral elements than flour of high extraction rate because these nutrients are mainly concentrated in the germ , bran and scutellum , all of which are removed in the production of low extraction-rate flour . This difference is clearly shown in Table 8.5 although it must be stressed that such figures are only of value if they refer to straight-run flour ( p. 149 ) as by appropriate variations in milling technique several flour streams of different composition can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicotinic acid , which are members of the B group of vitamins , are both present in greater concentrations in flour of high // extraction rate than in white ' flour , though the difference is not so marked as with thiamine . From a consideration of these facts it would appear that wholemeal bread is better , from a purely nutritional point of view , than bread produced from flour of lower extraction rate . This is not necessarily so , however , because although the nutrients listed above may be present in larger amounts in wholemeal flour than in flour of lower extraction rate it does not follow that they are also absorbed by the body in larger amounts . Flour of 100 per cent extraction rate may contain as much as 2.6 per cent fibre compared with 0.2 per cent for flour of 70 per cent extraction rate and there is evidence to show that the incorporation of much roughage with foods leads to a decrease in the amount of nutrients absorbed because of the increased peristalsis it produces . Most so-called wholemeal bread sold today , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coarsest bran particles having been removed from the flour . Again , although calcium , iron and phosphorus are present in larger amounts in wholemeal flour than in flour of lower extraction rate they may not be completely absorbed . This is because the phosphorus is present in the form of a complex acid called phytic acid which combines with calcium , and also with iron , to form insoluble salts , called phytates , which are not absorbed by the body . However , phytases present in the flour break down much of the phytic acid during breadmaking and so make it available to the body . In bread made from flour of 70 per cent extraction rate about 85 per cent of the phytic acid is broken down compared with only 30 per cent in bread made from flour of 95 per cent extraction rate . Whether or not the body is able to make full use of all the nutrients in wholemeal bread it remains true that vitamins and minerals are lost from wheat during the milling of flour of low extraction rate . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now obligatory for millers to add certain nutrients to all flour other than wholemeal flour of 100 per cent extraction rate . Sufficient iron , thiamine , nicotinic acid and purified chalk must be added to ensure that 100 g of the flour // will contain not less than 1.65 mg of iron , 0.24 mg of thiamine , 1.60 mg of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide and between 235 mg and 390 mg of calcium carbonate . The iron is added as ferric ammonium nitrate or , rather surprisingly , as metallic iron produced in a finely divided state by reducing ferric oxide with hydrogen . Flour of any extraction rate may be produced provided that the above nutrients are present in the stated amounts . BISCUITS . Biscuits are made from flour with the addition of other ingredients such as salt , fat , sugar and flavouring agents . Baking powder is sometimes added to make them rise a little and some biscuits , such as cream crackers , are leavened with yeast in much the same way as bread . The dough is rolled to a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high temperature . The water content of biscuits is only about 3 per cent compared with about 39 per cent in bread . The energy value of sweet biscuits may be twice as high as that of bread because of their low water content and the extra sugar and fat they contain . SEMOLINA . In addition to being used in flour milling ( see p. 149 ) the name semolina is given to a wheat product obtained wholly from the endosperm of Durum wheat ( which is rich in gluten ) . It is made by milling wheat grains but the particle size is much greater than that of flour . MACARONI , SPAGHETTI AND VERMICELLI . These are all made from semolina of high protein content . The semolina is mixed to a doughy mass with water and is then thoroughly kneaded . The kneaded dough is next transferred to a press where it is extruded through a hole of the desired size and shape , to give tubes or threads which are afterwards dried for a long period . These wheat products are cooked by immersion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as three times their own weight of water . Because of this high water content large quantities of these foods are required to provide a sustaining meal , and they are usually supplemented by other more nutritious foods such as cheese . SHREDDED WHEAT AND PUFFED WHEAT . These are breakfast foods prepared from whole wheat grains . The former is made from shredded , cooked wheat grains and the latter from wheat grains which have been cooked under pressure . At the end of the cooking period , the pressure is released and the grains become inflated or puffed ' by the air and steam within them . // Other Cereals Oats , rye , barley , maize and rice are all important cereals but their contribution to the British diet is much less than that of wheat . OATS . Oats are richer in fats and mineral elements than other cereals and their protein content is also high . Flour made from oats is not suitable for making bread , however , because the proteins it contains do not form an elastic complex like the gluten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human consumption by cleaning them and then drying and storing for a period . This facilitates the removal of the closely adherent husk . The product , known as grows , can be ground to produce oatmeal or rolled into flakes after being partially cooked by steam . The rolling ruptures the cell walls and flattens the grains and this makes subsequent cooking easier . Oatmeal contains roughly 12 per cent protein , 73 per cent carbo-hydrate and 9 per cent fat . Consequently , oatmeal and rolled oats are nutritious foods , oatmeal having an energy value of 1692 kg/100 g . It must be remembered , however , that porridge made with water contains only about one-eighth of its weight of oatmeal . The phosphorus content of oatmeal is relatively high and it is mainly present in the combined form as phytic acid which , as has already been pointed out in connection with wheat , combines with calcium and iron and prevents their absorption by the body . RYE . Rye can be grown in areas where the climate is too severe for wheat . The nutrients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat . It is much less valued that wheat , however , because the proteins it contains do not give a strong gluten during doughmaking and , while large quantities of bread are made from rye flour , the product differs markedly from bread as we know it . Rye flour gives stodgy loaves which are unattractive to those accustomed to wheat bread . However , rye-bread is still a staple article of diet in Northern Europe , especially among the poor classes . Rye-bread may contain substantial proportions of wheat flour and this improves the appearance of the loaves obtained . It is not eaten to a large extent in this country , but crisp rye-biscuits ( e.g. Ryvita ' ) made from crushed whole rye grain are quite popular . BARLEY . Barley is not eaten as a cereal in this country but is grown extensively for the manufacture of malt for brewing and for animal fodder . Bread is never made from barley because its proteins do not form a gluten when mixed with water and an aerated loaf can not be obtained . // MAIZE . Maize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country . In other countries , particularly America and South Africa , it forms an important part of the diet . It can not be used for making bread because its proteins do not form a gluten . As a provider of energy maize is as efficient as the other cereals , but in other respects it is less desirable . The phosphorus in maize is present in combined form as phytic acid this can interfere with the absorption of calcium and iron by the body . The quantity of the vitamin nicotinic acid present is also small , and the deficiency is made more serious by the fact that the essential amino acid tryptophan , which can be converted by the body to nicotinic acid is also present in only small quantities . The deficiency disease pellagra is associated with high consumption of maize , but it should not occur if adequate amounts of other foods are eaten . Corn-on-the-cob , which is becoming popular as a vegetable in this country , is a special variety of maize . The popular breakfast food called cornflakes , and cornflour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maize products . Cornflour consists of little but starch and is made by washing away the protein and fat from maize flour with dilute alkaline solutions . Sago , tapioca and arrowroot are similar food products containing little except starch , but they are not made from cereals . Sago is produced from the pith of the sago palm , tapioca from // the roots of the cassava plant and arrowroot from the underground stem or rhizome of the West Indian maranta . RICE . This is the main cereal of oriental countries though it is not important in British diets . It is the poorest of all cereals in protein , fat and mineral elements and can hardly be called a nutritious food although , like all cereals , it is a valuable source of energy . Rice has an energy value of 1530 kg/100 g and to provide the 12 MJ required daily by a moderately active man almost 900 g of rice would be required . This would weigh nearly 4 kg after cooking because of the large quantities of water absorbed by rice during boiling . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are removed during its preparation as a food for human beings . The grains are then polished to remove a thin skin called silverskin . The layers removed , particularly the silverskin , contain thiamine , and polished rice is completely lacking in this important vitamin . Consumption of polished rice as a main article of diet may produce the disease beriberi , which is caused by a deficiency of thiamine . Potatoes The potato is not a true root like the carrot , but is a swollen underground stem or tuber which contains a store of food for the plant . Potatoes contain about 15 ? 20 per cent starch , the remainder being mainly water with small quantities of proteins , mineral elements and vitamins . Potatoes are primarily a cheap source of energy , their energy value being about 324 kg/100 g . They are not , however , such a rich source of energy as cereal products and bread provides about three times as much energy as an equal weight of potatoes . Potatoes contain about 0.35 per cent nitrogen and of this , about half is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogenous compounds present are amino acids and these are as valuable , from the nutritional point of view , as proteins . In addition to their importance as an energy source potatoes also provide valuable quantities of ascorbic acid . Raw , new potatoes contain about 30 mg/100 g of this vitamin and some 60 per cent of this may remain in peeled boiled potatoes . The concentration of ascorbic acid is lower in the skin of the potato than in the interior , but the tissue immediately beneath the skin , which is usually removed when potatoes are peeled before cooking , contains about 15 per cent of the total ascorbic acid content of the tuber . When potatoes are cooked in their skin the peel removed afterwards is much thinner and less ascorbic acid is lost . // CARBOHYDRATES AS FOODSTUFFS Foodstuffs rich in carbohydrates are of value primarily as sources of energy . Weight for weight , proteins provide roughly the same amount of energy as carbohydrates , and fats provide twice as much . Of the three , however , carbohydrates are by far the cheapest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mentioned that over-indulgence in foods rich in sugar may lead to obesity and to under-consumption of other foods containing essential nutrients . These remarks apply equally to over-consumption of foods containing polysaccharides because these are hydrolysed to monosaccharides before absorption . If more monosaccharide is produced than is required the excess is converted into fat and stored in fat depots until it is required for provision of energy in time of restricted food intake . In the absence of sufficient carbohydrate the energy requirements of the body can be met by protein and fat , and it is possible to live on a diet containing little carbohydrate . Eskimos , for example , live almost exclusively on protein and fat . In Japan , on the other hand , about 80 per cent of the total energy intake is supplied by carbohydrate . A diet which is low in carbohydrate is not recommended for persons in normal health , however , because carbohydrate spares ' protein . The body can make best use of ingested protein if carbohydrate is eaten at the same time . Carbohydrates in the Body During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cellulose ) , are hydrolysed by enzymes to their component monosaccharides . The process starts in the mouth , where saliva , which contains salivary amylase , is intimately mixed with the food and begins to hydrolyse the starch to maltose . The hydrolysis continues in the stomach until the food is acidified by mixture with the gastric juice . The food passes from the stomach to the small intestine , where pancreatic amylase continues the conversion of starch to maltose . Maltase present in the intestinal juices hydrolyses the maltose so formed to glucose . Lactase and sucrase , which are also present , convert lactose and sucrose to glucose , galactose and fructose , as explained in Chapter 7 . The monosaccharides pass from the small intestine into the bloodstream and are carried to the liver ( where fructose and galactose are enzymically converted to glucose ) and the muscles . The liver and muscles are able to convert glucose to glycogen which serves as a reserve of carbohydrate for the body . Glycogen is reconverted to glucose as required to meet the energy requirements of the muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may // contain as much as 250 g of glycogen and up to 100 g , which is sufficien to satisfy his glucose requirements for about six hours , may be present in his liver . When the muscles and liver can accommodate no more glycogen the surplus glucose is converted by the liver into fat which is stored in fat depots as the body 's second line of defence against food shortage . A small amount of glucose circulates in the blood for transport to tissues drawing upon the liver 's carbohydrate stocks or for transport to the liver to be converted to glycogen . After eating a meal the blood may contain up to 0.14 per cent glucose but this figure falls to about 0.08 per cent some three or four hours after eating . This is quite a small amount and is equivalent to only about 5 g of glucose . The Oxidation of Glucose The Body obtains energy by converting fats , proteins and carbo-hydrates to glucose and oxidizing that to simpler molecules and ultimately to carbon dioxide and water . The overall process may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning them in a power station or boiler . Metabolic oxidation is infinitely more subtle and impressive , however , and man 's most sophisticated fuel burning appliances are primitive compared with nature 's delicately balanced and controlled complex of interdependent reactions . The living cell has to function in an aqueous environment at a constant pH and at a comparatively low and essentially constant temperature . It can not use heat energy to do work and bearing in mind the limitations mentioned it may seem surprising that any energy is made available at all . In fact , however , as we shall see below , almost half the energy locked up in the glucose molecule is captured by the body and this is a better conversion rate than that achieved by the most modern fuel-burning power station . When glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by burning in oxygen a large amount of heat is evolved : In many of these reactions the two hydrogen atoms removed are in the ooay , however , oxiaatton goes not taxe place in one step nut ny a complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which releases only a fraction of the energy which would be made available by complete oxidation of the glucose molecule . Many of the oxidative steps in this sequence of reactions do not involve direct reaction with oxygen at all but are simple dehydrogenation reactions which can be represented by a general equation : // transferred to a coenzyme , e.g. Coenzyme 1 , ( NAD , i.e. nicotina-mideadenine dinucleotide ) or Coenzyme 11 ( NADP , i.e. nicotina-mideadenine dinucleotide phosphate ) which act as hydrogen acceptors . The transfer is catalysed by oxidases which are highly specific in the sense that a particular oxidase will only work with one substrate-coenzyme pair . There are two main stages in the oxidation of glucose by the body . In the first stage it is converted by a series of reactions to pyruvic acid : In the second stage the pyruvic acid is oxidized by a further series of reactions to carbon dioxide and water : The first stage is called glycolysis or , since it can take place in the absence of oxygen , anaerobic glycolysis . The amount of energy made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second stage . Energy for violent physical exercise ? such as running to catch a bus is required instantly and as the bloodstream may be unable to supply oxygen sufficiently quickly to permit complete oxidation of glucose , anaerobic glycolysis takes place preferentially . The pyruvic acid produced is reduced to lactic acid and this is carried by the bloodstream to the liver where part of it is oxidized to provide energy for reconversion of the remainder to glycogen and glucose . The cyclic conversion of glucose to pyruvic acid , lactic acid and back to glucose is known as the Cori cycle after its discoverers . Normally , when energy is not required so quickly , it is obtained by complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water via pyruvic acid and about 75 per cent of the cell 's energy requirements are provided by the second stage . Conversion of pyruvic acid to carbon dioxide and water occurs by a cyclic process involving citric acid which is often referred to as the citric acid cycle or , in deference to Sir Hans Krebs , who worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 8.12 summarizes the changes which occur during the digestion absorption and oxidation of carbohydrates by the body . The biochemical oxidation of glucose is a complex and involved process and it took over fifty years to work out exactly how it occurs . All the separate reactions are enzyme-controlled , ten enzymes being required for the conversion to pyruvic acid and another ten for the // second stage of the oxidation to carbon dioxide and water . The whole sequence is of great importance and beauty but many readers will be relieved to learn that we do not intend to give complete details of it here . One aspect of the oxidation process , which is common to both the first and second stages , and is indeed a feature of many other biochemical energy transformations , deserves further attention however . This is the way in which a compound with the intimidating name of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP for short ) can behave as an energy-bank or energy store-house for the body . ATP is built up from one molecule of the purine derivative adenine , one molecule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and three molecules of phos-phoric acid . In the body the phosphate groups may be split off successively from an ATP molecule to yield first adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , then adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) , and finally adenosine itself . The adenosine part of the molecule is unchanged in this series of reactions and if we represent it by A we can represent the series of reactions as follows : // The importance of the series of reactions ( shown on p. 170 ) is the fact that the two terminal phosphate groups are attached by high-energy phosphate bonds ( shown in dark print in the equations ) and conversion of 1 mole of ATP to ADP or one mole of ADP to AMP is accompanied by the release of 33 kJ . Conversion of AMP to adenosine , on the other hand , only yields 12.6 kJ . In the reverse reactions the same amounts of energy are absorbed : The energy-rich phosphate bonds function as energy stockpiles for energy released during oxidation of glucose in the cell . The energy is available for re-use on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the synthesis of some other molecule by the body or for any other purpose . When this occurs ATP is converted to ADP or AMP which are then re-available for conversion to ATP at a time when surplus energy is available . During the complete oxidation of one mole of glucose by the body thirty-six moles of ATP ( or their equivalent in related compounds ) are formed from ADP and the energy absorbed in this process and hence available for further use is 36 x 33 = 1188 kJ . This compares with the 2820 kJ evolved when glucose is burned in oxygen and from this we see that the body is able to capture about 43 per cent of the energy of the glucose molecule . The residue is either used up in making other molecules during the oxidation process or appears as heat . The complicated series of reactions involved in the assimilation and utilization of glucose by the body are controlled by several hormones the best known of which is insulin , which is secreted by the pancreas . In the disease diabetes mellitus insufficient insulin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blood in abnormally large amounts and is not taken up by the liver or muscles for conversion to glycogen or for oxidation . The body is thus unable to utilize carbohydrate foods and has to resort instead to fats and proteins to make up its energy deficiencies . Unfortunately , increased utilization of fat in this way leads to accumulation of certain poisonous products of fat metabolism in the liver and the bloodstream and this can have serious consequences . Diabetes mellitus can be controlled by careful attention to the diet and in more severe cases by regular injections of insulin . Dietary Fibre The term fibre is hard to define ; it is not simply cellulose ( p. 138 ) for it includes other polysaccharides , hemicelluloses and lignin ( p. 266 ) . Some foods , such as lean , stringy beef from old animals and old root vegetables such as carrots contain fibre that is coarse . Other foods , however , such as wholemeal bread and young root and leafy vegetables contain fibre which is much finer . Both the quality and quantity of fibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibre that produces beneficial effects in the body . The term dietary fibre is usually taken to mean the indigestible parts of leaves , stems , roots , seeds and fruit of plants , but excludes the coarse fibres of meat and fish . Until recently the fibre or roughage content of the diet was regarded simply as that part of food which could not be digested and which , apart from its ability to produce soft , bulky stools , passed through the body unchanged . It is now believed , however , that the low fibre content in the diet of Western industrialized communities may contribute to a number // of diseases including diverticulosis of the colon , coronary heart disease and cancer of the bowel . Although fibre is not digested in the body it is not simply an inert material , for it has a number of important effects . The best known of these is the laxative effect of fibre , especially wheat fibre in the form of bran , caused by the water-holding capacity of fibre in the large intestine . Apart from this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , it alters the effect of microbes in the colon and it can absorb some toxic materials . Certain types of fibre e.g. pectin can lower blood cholesterol . During the last hundred years extensive refining of cereals , par ticularly in industrialised countries , has gradually reduced the amount of cereal fibre in the diet . This is now a matter of concern and while much research remains to be done it would seem a prudent precaution to increase the content of fine fibre , particularly cereal fibre , in the diet . Chapter Nine Amino acids and proteins Previous chapters have been concerned with substances containing the elements carbon , hydrogen and oxygen , and it has been shown that these elements combined in the form of fats and carbohydrates are of fundamental importance in food science . In addition to these elements there is a fourth , namely nitrogen , which also plays a vital role in human life and which , when combined in the form of amino acids and proteins , constitutes a third group of compounds which are of basic importance in food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand and the complex proteins required by man on the other . The way in which nitrogen is built up by stages into animal protein and then degraded in further stages back again into nitrogen is summed up in the nitrogen cycle . Elementary nitrogen occurs in almost limitless quantities in the atmosphere , while combined nitrogen is widely distributed in the soil in the form of salts and , in the form of organic compounds , is found in all living matter . Combined nitrogen forms an essential part of the structure of the body , which requires a continuous supply of nitrogen in a suitable form . Unfortunately the body is unable to synthesize its nitrogen compounds starting from elementary nitrogen ; indeed , it is unable to perform such syntheses , even when it is provided with a supply of inorganic nitrogen compounds . This means that man must be supplied with nitrogen which has already been converted into suitable organic form . This produces the paradoxical situation that though nitrogen is abundant in its elementary form , nitrogen compounds which can be utilized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the character of the element , which is noted for its inertness . This lack of reactivity makes it difficult to convert the element into its compounds , a process which is called fixation . Fixation of nitrogen into ammonia and subsequently into soluble ammonium salts is carried out commercially , but the amounts of fixed // nitrogen thus produced are infinitesimal compared with the amounts required by living things . Fortunately , nitrogen fixation carried out with difficulty by chemists is performed with ease in nature , aided by micro-organisms such as Rhizobium , which enable leguminous plants such as peas and beans to synthesize protein from nitrogen . Other green plants synthesize protein from nitrates present in the soil . Synthesis of protein is opposed by destructive processes which break down protein by stages into nitrogen , thus completing the cycle which is summarized in Fig. 9.1 . Amino Acids Amino acids contain an amino group ? NH2 and a carboxyl group ? COOH . The simplest example of such an acid is amino acetic acid , called glycine , in which one of the hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by an amino group . Amino acids of interest in nutrition have the amino group attached to the carbon atom next to the carboxyl group and may be represented by the general formula : The nature of R may vary considerably . In the simplest case of glycine it is a hydrogen atom while in more complex amino acids it may be an aliphatic or aromatic radical . Amino acids can exist in stereoisomeric forms as the carbon atom to which R is attached is asymmetric except in the case of glycine where R is a hydrogen atom . The asymmetric carbon atom has been found to have the same configuration in all the naturally occurring optically active amino acids and this configuration is designated the L-form . CLASSIFICATION OF AMINO ACIDS . More than twenty amino acids have been obtained from food and body proteins . They may be classified as being either neutral , basic or acidic . Neutral amino acids are those , like glycine , which contain one amino and one carboxyl group , basic amino acids contain one carboxyl but more than one basic group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carboxyl groups . Table 9.1 gives the amino acids of most interest in nutrition . Those amino acids marked by the letter E are essential amino acids , a term which is explained on page 190 . PROPERTIES OF AMINO ACIDS . Amino acids are white crystalline substances which are soluble to some extent in water but which are mostly // insoluble in organic solvents . The amino group , as its name suggests , is related to ammonia and like ammonia it has basic characteristics while the carboxyl group is acidic . The combination of an amino group and a carboxyl group in the same molecule results in it being able to act as an acid or a base ; such a substance is said to be amphoteric . The formulae shown in Table 9.1 show the arrangement of covalent bonds in amino acids but they do not show the ionic character which amino acids display in solution . In solution amino acids may be more correctly represented as follows : // This formula shows the ionic character of an amino acid and that it contains both a positive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ionize according to the pH of the system . We can represent this ionization as : Thus if acid is added to a neutral solution of an amino acid a positive ion is formed , whereas if alkali is added a negative ion is formed . Therefore an amino acid may be neutral or positively or negatively charged according to the pH of the system . When an amino acid is neutral , that is when the positive and negative charges are equal , it is said to be at its isoelectric point and it is called a zwitterion or dipolar ion . Such zwitterions are effective buffers because of their capacity to combine with both acids and bases , thus preventing the change of pH that would otherwise occur . The buffering action of amino acids is very important , particularly in living cells where the cell can only function provided that the pH is maintained within a narrow range . The isoelectric points of a number of amino acids are shown in Table 9.1 . The isoelectric point is important because at this pH many properties have either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductivity , solubility and viscosity are all a minimum . The reason why electrical conductivity is a minimum is fairly obvious the net charge on each molecule is zero but the reason why solubility should also be a minimum is rather less obvious . Although at the isoelectric point the over-all charge on amino acid molecules is zero , a dipole exists and this results in strong electrostatic attraction between neighbouring molecules which results in the molecules packing closely together . Other factors , such as hydrogen bonding , may also accentuate the close-packing effect and the resultant close-packing of amino acid molecules reduces the possibility of interaction with solvent molecules and therefore reduces solubility to be a minimum . Although amino acids containing one amino and one carboxyl group are neutral in reaction , yet it will be noted from Table 9.1 that their isoelectric point is not at pH 7 . This is because the dissociation constants of the two groups are not equal . Amino acids containing more amino groups than carboxyl groups are basic and have isoelectric points above pH 7 , while those with more carboxyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Glutamic acid is an example of an amino acid containing two carboxyl // groups and one amino group . It is a white crystalline solid which has an acidic reaction in water and an isoelectric point of pH 3.2 . It is of particular interest in that it is produced in large quantities for conversion into its sodium salt which is used in food preparation as a seasoning agent . The free acid was first isolated in 1866 by hydrolysing wheat gluten which yields 36 per cent glutamic acid . This forms the basis of one modern method of extraction , the hydrolysis being carried out using hydrochloric acid . The resulting products are neutralized , filtered and subjected to fractional crystallization , when glutamic acid crystals are obtained as one of the fractions . MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE . When glutamic acid is dissolved in water and the solution is neutralized with sodium hydroxide , monosodium glutamate is formed and after purification and crystallization it is obtained as a white , odourless solid . Although the pure salt has only a faint flavour of its own , it enhances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For this reason it is now added to a large range of foods , usually in amounts of 0.1 ? 0.3 per cent . It is notably successful in bringing out the natural flavour of meat , fish and vegetable foods and is now added to many canned foods , particularly to fish and meat products but also to some soups , such as mushroom and chicken noodle . It is also used to enhance the flavour of dehydrated vegetable foods and is found in many soup powders . The powdered salt can be used with fresh food , being added before cooking or sprinkled on afterwards as a condiment . Although previously regarded as harmless recent evidence suggests that a small proportion of people may suffer unpleasant effects when relatively large amounts are ingested , as has sometimes happened in Chinese restaurants . Glutamate occurs both in foods and in the body either free or as part of proteins . For example , proteins of foods such as milk , cheese and meat are rich in glutamate while some vegetables , notably mushrooms , tomatoes and peas , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both free and as part of the protein ; about one-fifth of body protein is glutamate . Peptides When two amino acid molecules combine , the acid group in one molecule reacts with the basic group in the other with the elimination of water :
