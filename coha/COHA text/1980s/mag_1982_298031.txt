FIREFOX Directed by Clint Eastwood Screenplay by Alex Lasher and Wendell Wellman <P> There are two movies in Firefox . The first is earthbound , the kind of well-made but not very venturesome adventure picture that almost four decades of cold war have made all too familiar . The second , however , is airborne , an extravagant flight into the realm of special visual effects . For the film 's producer-director-star , Clint Eastwood , it represents an attempt to arrange a shrewd encounter of a new kind , with the young audience that likes things that go whoosh in the night . <P> Eastwood plays Mitchell Gant , a sometime hot pilot in Nam , still plagued by bad dreams and occasionally immobilized by horrific memories of the war . The British-American intelligence team that has picked up disturbing signals from the Soviet Union is less concerned with his mental state than his still keen airman 's skills . They want him to sneak into Russia , filch the futuristic fighter plane that provides the film with its title as well as its best moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , sly street-corner meetings in Moscow , a chase on the subway , murder in the men 's room-the stuff of uncounted spy movies is piled on , albeit with the unassuming efficiency that is the hallmark of Eastwood 's directorial style . If he ca n't make it fresh , he can make it lively . The fact that his character has a tendency to be shocked into passive reveries about his wartime experiences whenever he hears a loud noise adds suspense and humanity to the film . By the time a spy ring of Jewish Russian dissidents are inserting him into the top-secret complex where Firefox has been developed , one is well and truly ensnared in the plot 's web . <P> But all of that is merely prelude . Even his fiery escape in the plane , under the out-of-joint nose of the Communist Party 's First Secretary , first-rate though the sequence is , does not prepare one for the marvels that follow . For Firefox is a magical airplane . It is blur-fast . It is invisible to radar . It has a shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot can direct its weaponry with his brain waves ; you think bad thoughts about the other guy , and blam ! you blow him right out of the sky . It is probably true that possession of such a plane would control the cold war balance of power .
