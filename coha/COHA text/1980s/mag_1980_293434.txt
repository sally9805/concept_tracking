Are neutrinos helping to pull the universe together ? <P> <P> They are the ghosts of particle physics , so tiny and elusive that a billion could pass through a bar of lead without hitting anything en route . Traveling at the speed of light , neutrinos carry no charge and apparently no mass . Even after they were detected in 1956 , they remained curious , spectral bits of energy . As one of the scientists who discovered them , Frederick Reines , explains , they seemed to have " no frills and no complications . " <P> Last week Reines astonished colleagues with word that neutrinos may not be so simple after all . Returning to the same nuclear facility in South Carolina where he had performed his detection feat , he found that the erstwhile ghosts do indeed seem to have substance . Not much even on the nuclear scale , perhaps only one ten-thousandth of the mass of the electron , but big enough to stir the world of physics . If his results are right , they may help explain the sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate . <P> In his initial work , Reines , 62 , a researcher at the University of California in Irvine , had measured the flow of neutrinos , or more precisely anti-neutrinos ( their antimatter twins ) , in the streams of particles coming from a nuclear reactor at the Government 's Savannah River weapons-grade plutonium plant . This time , Reines , joined by Physicists Henry W. Sobel and Elaine Pasierb , faced a more complicated task . By now neutrinos were believed to come in at least three varieties , or " flavors " : one associated with electrons , the two others with larger particles called muons and taus . <P> To catch these particles , the physicists placed a sealed container of deuterium , or heavy water , 11.2 meters ( 37 ft. ) from the reactor . Immersed in the liquid were ten helium-filled tubes wired to an external oscilloscope . The detection apparatus was shielded in lead and cadmium cylinders and a foot-thick " pot " to block everything but neutrinos . As the particles barreled through the heavy water , some scored bull's-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain an extra neutron . These collisions produced other particles , including more neutrons that struck the helium-filled tubes and registered on the oscilloscope . <P> To their surprise , the scientists counted fewer than half the electron neutrinos anticipated . Reines speculates that they had changed flavors , or oscillated , turning into muon or tau neutrinos during their short journey . If such a switch had occurred , the neutrinos must have mass ( since physics dictates that one kind of particle must have mass to turn into another ) . Said Reines : " The simple view of the massless neutrino does not square with experimental facts . " <P> Some physicists greeted Reines ' findings with skepticism . Said Theorist Chris Quigg of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago : " It 's a brute force , heroic effort rather than an elegant experiment with lots of internal checks . " But none denied that if Reines ' case can be confirmed , it will have wide-ranging implications .                  @ @ @
