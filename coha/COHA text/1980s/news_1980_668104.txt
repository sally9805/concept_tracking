The chairman and commissioners of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination ( MCAD ) today shot down as " unbalanced " Boston ' s $26-million Community Development Block Grant ( CDBG ) proposal . Chairman Darrel Outlaw said this morning use of the funds proposed to the Housing and Urban Development Department ( HUD ) by the city , although showing some improvements since the MCAD ' s June 11 recommendations , are still inadequate in several areas . " This proposal is a clear example of institutional racism , " said Comr . Sam Stonefield . " Some people will benefit from it - but it won ' t be the poor or those of color . " As the state ' s only civil rights agency , MCAD makes its recommendations to HUD , which then takes into consideration the measures rejected or approved by the state agency . HUD may send the proposal back to the city for alterations if it thinks MCAD ' s concerns are warranted , said Stonefield . The commissioners said they could not recommend this package for several reasons , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families and because the proposal seems to " fuel displacement in the city . " " Someone has to make the city change before the city gets the money , " Outlaw said . " After we get the money ( for a three-year grant ) it will be too late . " " They have to revise this application to serve the people who should be served - the elderly and the poor , " Stonefield said . He explained that the " major issues - who will live in Boston and who will benefit from the package " - have not been addressed . Stonefield said that as the proposal is now worded the weatherizationfunds " will go to the Hyde Park and West Roxbury homeowners rather than to the poor . " The displacement clause is , according to Comr . Alex Rodriguez , " woefully inadequate " because it only deals with one building in the Fenway project . Outlaw said disorders such as the recent one at the Faneuil housing project in Brighton could have been avoided if funds were used for extra security and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program should address such areas as Charlestown , the South End and Roxbury , Outlaw said . The commissioners also asked that ten percent of the CDBG go directly to the Boston Housing Authority . The measure now calls for approximately $2.2 million for security at various BHA projects , instead of the usual 10 percent . BHA project residents represent 25 percent of all low- and moderate-income persons in the city . Rodriguez did agree , though , that the current figure of $2 million for social services , or about 8 percent of this year ' s CBDG grant instead of the 15 percent of past years , is better than the June 11 application ' s proposal of zero dollars . Another key issue , Outlaw said , is the reduction of funding from $3.5 million to $3.1 million for commercial and industrial development . Rodriguez said the commissioners are still concerned about provisions for minority business participation and affirmative action requirements . The revised application also reduced the amount of funds allocated to capital improvements from $3.7 million to $2.8 million . The commissioners said they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because city representatives have said in the past that certain of these improvements would ordinarily have been financed by other means were it not for the present state of the bond market . As for employment , Stonefield said , " In key departments they simply have not met affirmative action goals ; in fact , in some departments there has actually been a decrease in the hiring of women and minorities . " Stonefield said the MCAD is also concerned about the Mayor ' s Office of Human Rights staff . " We can only account for 16 of the 52 employees reported to be working in the office , " Stonefield said . " We can not account for 70 percent of the employees . Our job is to make sure it ' s not a phony operation . " This proposal just lacks balance ; it is directed disproportionately against the poor , " he said .
