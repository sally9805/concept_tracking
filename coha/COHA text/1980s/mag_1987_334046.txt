From its conception in the late 1960s , the B-1B bomber has been a child of controversy . A breathtakingly beautiful airplane with slim-silhouette wings that meld into a fuselage that breathes speed , the swanlike aircraft is designed to penetrate Soviet air defenses , unleashing nuclear-tipped missiles at targets deep inside the country . But skeptics lampooned the B-1B  --  at $283 million a copy the most expensive plane in aviation history  --  as an unnecessary and probably unworkable interim successor to the aging B-52s , and in 1977 President Jimmy Carter scuttled the project . Newly elected Ronald Reagan revived the B-1B in 1981 , ordering 100 of the bombers , but as production approaches the halfway point , critics in the Pentagon and elsewhere are decrying the plane as something of a turkey , a " flying Edsel . " <P> Pentagon officials insist that is not the case . Says Air Force General Lawrence Skantze : " The B-1B is the best , most capable bomber in the world today . " Claims Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger : " The plane will do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force Secretary Thomas Cooper told Congress , " We have to be aware of the limitations in the B-1B right now and plan accordingly . " The Air Force is also withholding almost $300 million from contractors for poor performance . Last week , tucked away in the Defense Department 's 1988 budget proposal was the Air Force 's most public admission yet of troubles : a request for $600 million to repair problems with the aircraft . <P> In its rush to deploy the B-1B , the Air Force went into production while the aircraft was still undergoing major design modifications . Even before the first bombers became operational last fall at Dyess Air Force Base in Texas , there were portents of trouble . The plane 's fuel tanks , built directly into the wings without rubber bladders , leak jet fuel . Early flight tests revealed problems caused by loading cruise missile launchers and antiradiation pods onto the original airframe design . In gaining an extra 41 tons  --  nearly a 25% increase  --  without additional wing surface , the B-1B had acquired an extraordinary " wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice the weight carried by the commercial Boeing 747 . The added weight means the plane is prone to stall when the pilot attempts complex escape maneuvers . New stall- inhibitor and stabilization mechanisms will ease the problem but will make it more difficult for the B-1B to execute maneuvers vital to survival . Pilots complain that the heavy load makes the aircraft " fly like an elephant . " <P> There are other problems . Pilots bringing the B-1B to treetop level found that the ground-tracking radar , designed to keep the plane from slamming into hills , was inadequate . The system jerked the B-1B up and down , causing considerable internal stress . Fuel consumption turned out to be enormous , particularly when the pilot kicked in the afterburner to accelerate through enemy defenses , raising doubts whether the plane can even reach its targets . So many difficulties emerged in flying the aircraft that some 40% of the training missions have had to be scrubbed .
