Gardner will head Cal <P> Well , Dad , I guess you 're going to be a lameduck in Utah and a sitting duck in California , " quipped Lisa Gardner , 16 , when she heard about her father 's appointment last week . On July 1 , after a decade as the University of Utah 's popular president , David Pierpont Gardner , 49 , takes on what is probably the nation 's most challenging job in education . He will become the 15th president of the nine-campus , 139,176-student University of California , the finest public university system in the U.S. , and one , as Gardner says , " where all the forces blowing through society come to bear . " <P> When he replaces David S. Saxon , who is leaving California to become chairman of the governing board at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Gardner will face some pressing problems : a 2% cut of $23 million in state aid this year , to $1.13 billion ; lagging faculty salaries ( 16.5% below the average at such other prestigious institutions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion during the next decade to modernize the university 's science and technology departments . Gardner will also have to handle pressure to increase the proportion of women on the faculty ( currently 11.6% ) and minorities in the student body ( 5.6% ) . He will have to decide whether to side with liberals on the faculty and in the student body and relinquish university control of the Los Alamos and Livermore atomic-weapons laboratories . <P> Gardner knows full well what he is getting into . Says Michael Heyman , chancellor of the university 's Berkeley campus : " I tend to think of this as someone coming back into the family . " In all , Gardner has spent a dozen years in the California system , first as a student earning his M.A. in political science and doctorate in higher education at Berkeley , then as a skilled , tactful administrator . As Santa Barbara 's vice chancellor during the riot-torn late ' 60s and early ' 70s , he worked effectively as liaison between the university administration , the Governor , the students and local police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Utah . Gardner , who is a Mormon , was able to ease the rivalry between Mormons and non-Mormons over key appointments to the university . He named deans and other officials without any regard to their religions . By 1981 , he had led an expansion drive that raised the budget from $102 million to $264 million , and by 1982 the number of students had increased from 19,000 to 24,365 . Utah 's math and biology departments were rated " the most improved " during the past five years by the Conference Board of Associated Research Councils , composed of a number of learned societies . Barney Clark received his artificial heart at Utah 's medical school . <P> In August 1981 , the White House chose Gardner to head the President 's National Commission on Excellence in Education , an 18-member , blue-ribbon group that is studying ways of bolstering the nation 's educational system . The commission 's final report is due next month . " It will be hard-hitting , " Gardner promises .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
