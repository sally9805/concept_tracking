Even after four years , it comes back in a sweep . All it takes is one glimpse of a hockey shirt with U.S.A. planted on the front , and suddenly the scene re-erupts in the mind : sticks waved like flags , teammates hugging , a crowd in sweet tears . Odd for the summertime nation that a Winter Olympics provided such a memorable moment in sports , so memorable that half of us still swear that we beat the Russians , not the Finns , in the finals . But winter plays tricks with the senses . If we did n't know better , it would appear that 1 those people are actually traveling on their sides in a bobsled at 75 m.p.h. , and sailing off a 90-meter platform on skis , poised in the air like flying hinges , and plunging furiously down a mountain , making erratic Zs among poles stuck in the snow . <P> Within hours of the opening ceremonies , one will be saying such words as " biathlon " again , and talking of Nordic skiing and the luge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense return to the Old World on these occasions , or a dream version of that world , to European movie kingdoms where athletes really do come from Liechtenstein . For 1984 : Sarajevo . ( Henceforth no schoolchild will be stumped on that <P> World War I question . ) Not our neck of the woods exactly . Yet Americans will be neither out of place nor outclassed this year , even if we will not see Eric Heiden wearing his five gold medals like a Titan 's necklace , or pumping his arms in the golden suit that appeared welded to his body . Not that his outfit was wilder than anyone else 's in this ice capade : goggle-eyed skiers in interplanetary helmets , figure skaters sprayed with sequins spinning in electric blues , the brash colors seeming to make a protest against the frozen season . <P> Which may account for a basic appeal of these sports : their headlong assault on the weather . Or maybe it is the controlled craziness of the events . On surfaces difficult enough to walk on upright do these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add an extra unnatural measure of defiance by going airborne . Fanatics . Only a spill proves them mortal . So reckless is their attitude that , watching them , one barely believes in the danger . Then someone 's momentum is shattered , and a kid lies piled up in his skis like a broken bird . Silence replaces wonder . <P> Or then again , it may be the silence that holds us in the first place , and not the speed . Skaters whooshing slightly , skis barely cracking the snow 's <P> shell . Take away the crowds from these Olympics , and there would be very little to hear but your own heart racing . Until the closing ceremonies , when the nations who first entered the stadium as if parading before the galaxy , block by formal block , break ranks , and the competitors , chanting raucously off-key , embrace one another in the most disorderly conduct . Pure mush , of course . Cliches down the line . So why are you smiling ? <P> <P> - By Roger Rosenblatt     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
