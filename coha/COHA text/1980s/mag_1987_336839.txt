Dying of alcoholism normally takes years . But before a final , prolonged bout of uncontrolled drinking caused my physical collapse and led to treatment , there was no doubt I was well on my way . My appearance was shocking . I was about 20 lbs . underweight and malnourished , the result of giving up almost all forms of food except coffee , sugar and , of course , alcohol . I was in the early stages of delirium tremens , the DTs . I sometimes heard faint ringing noises in my ears and suffered unexpected waves of vertigo . I felt near constant pressure in my lower back and sides from the punishment my liver and kidneys were taking . My personality was also seriously diseased . I was nervous , reclusive , by turns extravagantly arrogant and cringingly apologetic . I tried to cover my extremes of mood with brittle cheerfulness , even though I was desperately afraid . If you asked me how I was feeling , I usually lied , " Just fine . " <P> I now see " just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental condition . At the nadir , my addiction to a chemical that was killing me was nearly complete . I knew that something was very wrong with me . I even knew I was an alcoholic , but I had long since come to believe there was nothing I could do about it . I had decided that it was perfectly appropriate  --  just fine  --  that I should die . In fact , I honestly hoped that * I would , sparing further grief for many people I loved . Dying , I thought , was the best thing I could ever do for them . The idea of living without alcohol could not occur to me . I preferred the idea that I was a hopeless case . <P> No one finds alcoholism more mysterious than the suffering alcoholic , and I was no exception . I had no idea why I was an alcoholic at all , though I should have : my father was one . But from his illness I had gained only a morbid fear of the substance , which lasted until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That prolonged abstinence while my adolescent peers experimented with liquor only made what happened to me more mystifying . I thought I could take alcohol or leave it . <P> Why did I ever start to drink at all ? The short answer is that initially it made me feel better . Alcohol numbed my self-awareness , the same trick that it performs for nonalcoholic drinkers at cocktail parties . The difference is that normal drinkers dull their self-consciousness only slightly , the better to socialize . I very quickly tried to send all my thoughts and feelings about myself to oblivion . Psychologically , I was undoubtedly depressed when I began to overcome my well-founded but ill-understood fears about alcohol : my father died when I was a sophomore . For whatever reason , I spent the better part of two decades trying to stay emotionally and physically numb .
