Asher B. Edelman is readying a $23-a-share , or $416. 3 million , offer for the 18. 1 million Datapoint Corp. shares he doesn ' t already own . Mr. Edelman , a New York investor , already owns 2. 1 million shares , or about 10. 8% of the San Antonio , Texas-based maker of computer and office-communications products , which has 20. 2 million shares outstanding . Mr. Edelman plans to communicate the offer to Datapoint ' s investment bankers , Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , either today or Monday , said an investor close to the plans . Mr. Edelman yesterday declined to comment . " A comment is against my interests , " he said . Neither the structure nor the financing plans for the expected bid could be learned yesterday , but an offer by Mr. Edelman has been anticipated for some time . Last month , he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , saying he had acquired an 8% stake in Datapoint . The stock price has run up recently . In early November , Datapoint was trading at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite trading yesterday , Datapoint closed at $20. 375 , down 62. 5 cents , on trading of 121 , 100 shares . The stock was one of the leading percentage gainers on Tuesday . Mr. Edelman ' s expected offer appears overly generous , one Wall Street analyst suggested . " I really don ' t see that Datapoint is worth what he thinks it ' s worth , " said Stephen Smith , a Datapoint analyst at PaineWebber Inc . " The company has fundamental problems that will take a long time to overcome and assets that aren ' t easily broken apart , " Mr. Smith added . In the past , Mr. Edelman has purchased interests in publicly traded companies and orchestrated their restructuring , primarily by selling assets piecemeal . In his filing with the SEC in December , Mr. Edelman said he considers Datapoint a " good candidate for a liquidation , leveraged buyout , sale , merger " or other transaction . Datapoint wouldn ' t immediately comment , other than to say that , as previously reported , the company has engaged Kidder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeover bid . Beset with eroding customer loyalty , delayed product development and an exodus of executives , Datapoint would be most valuable as part of a bigger company , industry officials and analysts said . The company ' s strongest selling point is its " local area network " technology , which permits the linking of several computers and other business machines . One other attractive feature of Datapoint is its heavy cash position , last reported at $107 million . Datapoint has made no announcement to suggest that its efforts to find a " white knight " suitor interested in the local area network technology have been successful over the past three weeks or so . It ' s understood that Datapoint has approached American Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . , Apple Computer Inc . , Sperry Corp. and several other foreign and domestic computer companies about a possible acquisition . " This isn ' t an easy sell , " said one executive familiar with Datapoint ' s assets and business . Datapoint , once thought to have one of the strongest customer bases in the industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make its local area network capable of communicating with International Business Machines Corp. personal computers . Datapoint finally introduced those products in September , even though the local area network technology has been sold since 1977 . And only in November did the company introduce a 32-bit microprocessor for expanding the power and flexibility of the network system . Datapoint ' s image also has been slow to recover from an accounting scandal made public in 1982 , after which the SEC accused the company of overstating its revenue and net income for fiscal 1981 . Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing , the company consented last year to an order barring it from future securities violations . In the fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 27 , Datapoint earned $1. 5 million , or seven cents a share , down sharply from $5. 4 million , or 27 cents a share , a year earlier . Sales fell to $72. 1 million from $78. 1 million . " Our financial results in the near future may continue to be depressed , " the company said in its quarterly report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal
