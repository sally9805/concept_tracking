The dilemma might have stumped even King Solomon : what to do with seven fertilized eggs of a divorcing Tennessee couple that are frozen at an in-vitro fertilization clinic in Knoxville . Mary Sue Davis , 29 , is unable to conceive by natural means and wants custody of her " pre-born children " for future implantation . Junior Davis , 31 , claims he is being " raped of my reproductive rights " by his estranged wife and insists on having a joint say on the future of the embryos . " I do not want a child of mine in a single-parent situation , " he argued . <P> Last week in Maryville , Tennessee Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young announced his decision in the unprecedented case : the embryos are people , not property , and should go to the mother . In an opinion loaded with some of the coded language that often surrounds abortion controversies , Young ruled that " human life begins at conception . " The lawsuit ought to be decided as a question of custody , he concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child or children , in vitro that they be available for implantation . " Questions of final custody , child support and visitation rights will be decided later if there is a birth . Junior Davis immediately announced he would appeal . <P> Many medical and legal experts fear that the ruling , if upheld , could slow in-vitro research and intensify the national abortion debate . " A bad decision , " says Ellen Wright Clayton , a specialist in law and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University . The judge could simply have weighed the respective interests of each spouse , Clayton contends , and decided to award the eggs to Mrs. Davis without going on to say when life begins . <P> Young based his ruling on the testimony of Dr. Jerome Lejeune , a French specialist in human genetics who testified that the seven embryos each have unique characteristics that distinguish them as human beings . Three other experts argued that the embryos possess only the potential for life . Their views echo those of professional groups like the American Fertility Society , whose ethical committee in 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accorded to human tissue but not the respect accorded to actual persons . " <P> Tennessee was not the only site of an embryo dispute . Last week Risa and Steven York of California quietly settled their lawsuit against the Virginia institute holding their frozen embryo . The institute agreed to release the cells to the Yorks for implantation on the West Coast if it would not be held responsible for what happens when it surrenders custody . <P> Such controversies underscore the lack of clear rules to help resolve many of the ambiguities raised by the decade-old , $1 billion in-vitro baby business  --  particularly when the clinics and couples , like the Davises , fail to set out their rights and responsibilities in contracts . " Legislators do n't want to touch this hot potato , " says Boston University Law School professor Frances Miller , " so the courts have to deal with these issues . " With more than 200 conception clinics around the country , and 2 million couples seeking their services , the judges may get a workout.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
