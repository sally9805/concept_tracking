As soon as the era ended , after last October 's Black Monday , I caught the first available flight into Zurich . In the luminous gray fall morning the Paradeplatz was the eye of the financial hurricane . There was only the silent glide of streetcars and the rustle of newsprint . At times of common joy there is jubilation in public squares . At times of horror there is a reading of newspapers . The readers in Zurich had the same look of emergent dread , as if it were dawning upon all simultaneously that the obituaries they found their eyes drawn to were their own , and dated tomorrow . The Paradeplatz is the center of the Swiss banking industry . On its west side sits the limestone powerhouse of the Schweizerischer Bankverein . On the north , undraped maidens support the balconies of the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt . To the northeast is the gabled head office of Bank Leu , founded in 1755 , the oldest bank in Switzerland . A few doors up the Bahnhofstrasse stands the main building of the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs for cover when the sky is falling . The showcases of the Kreditanstalt Craig S. Karpel is a contributing editor of Harper 's Magazine . display the kind of fashions men design for women when stock prices are going to rise forever . If not for a single window before which a speechless crowd stands , gaping at the Reuters monitor as if they were at the scene of an accident , one might think this was not a bank but a department store , and one would be correct . Inside , the tellers ' cages and transaction desks are interspersed with this month 's exhibition turn-of-the-century sports artifacts . Strolling from high-wheeled bicycle to riding habit to fowling piece to challenge cup , one can pause and sell the Standard &; Poor 's index short , or convert dollars to deutsche marks , or discover that one owes more than one has . Like Las Vegas , the environment itself is conducive to parting with one 's money . Yet instead of the clocklessness of Vegas , which would be unthinkable in Switzerland , one is simply surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred by indicating the exact hour in so many cities around the world that one surrenders one 's sense of time in the locality of the moment . And there is the incandescent dazzle of twirling multilingual plexiglass signs along the foreign-exchange counters , the managers as watchful as pit bosses , the cashiers as affectless as croupiers , and preeminently the velvet rope , unhooked for high-rollers only . In the lounge in the southwest corner , one can easily distinguish theforeigners , who have rushed here to batten down their financial hatches , from the residents of the town . The latter know enough to sit , while the former seem to believe that quicker action is more likely if they stand . All are transfixed by an overhead carousel which flashes the prices of global securities . The carousel appears to be slowly turning , but those staring at it know that in actuality it is standing still while the earth revolves around it . Underneath there is a circular kiosk presided over by a sort of bartender of financial data . He knows that the information he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to be particularly consoling . A man in a tan cashmere topcoat approaches . " Can you tell me how much you 're buying Krugerrands for ? " he asks in an Australian accent . There is in his voice the forced calm of a man who must raise cash to meet a margin call . " Well , let 's see now , " says the clerk . He consults a price sheet and tells him . The Australian looks slightly hypoxic , as if he is finding the atmosphere up here in the Northern Hemisphere a trifle thin . " It 's slipped a bit , has n't it ? " he asks . " I would have thought it 'd shoot up . I mean , what with the dollar falling out of bed and all . " " Yes , it 's odd , is n't it , " says the clerk . " Perhaps it 's the Russians . " " The Russians ... " The Australian does n't want to hear about the Russians now . He wants to hear that 72 HARPER 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the plane from Sydney and canceled out his losses . " They could be taking this opportunity , " says the clerk , " to sell into a strong market . " " I 'll be back , " says the Australian . " I do n't have the coins with me . They 're in my hotel room , you see . My wife is there . " " Ah , " nods the clerk . His wife is there . People tell you things and you nod . " Thanks , " says the Australian . schein , " says the clerk . An American steps up . He is in his late sixties and has not shaved today . He has the downtrodden look of a drinking man presented with a situation in which he has no choice but to remain sober . " How 's ICI doing ? " he asks . " It 's down this morning . About ? 10 now , " says the clerk . " I just do n't see how that can be , " says the American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . It 's one of the biggest chemical companies in the world . But then I should n't really care , ' cause I 'm out of it at 11.90 . " " That 's good , " says the clerk . " No , it 's not so good , ' cause when I phoned in my sell order , the guy at the bank told me it was 14.55 . But when 1 called for confirmation , they said 1 got 11.90. 1 had 10,000 shares , so it 's a little matter of ? 26,500 . About $44,000 ! I came all the way from Arizona for this . The only way to straighten out this kind of thing is in person . I 'm going to rake their ass over the coals . " " Your account is with us ? " asks the clerk , stiffening . " Hell no , " says the American . " It 's with one of your competitors . " " Ah , " says the clerk . But Switzerland 's banks do not compete , any more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to bust their nuts , " says the American . " Mm-hm , " muses the clerk , as if he were polishing a cocktail glass with a cloth and holding it up to the light . I accompany the American as he strides unseeingly past the glittering Rolexes of the Bahnhofstrasse to the Ziirichsee , along the quay where the lake steamers are moored . " I ca n't believe it , " he says . " Ten days ago , my stocks were worth more than half a million dollars . Now it 's down to twohundred-and-something . Nothing like this has ever happened to me . Boy , am I ever going to roast their tail . They 're going to find out who they 're dealing with . " I find out who I 'm dealing with . " Retired military . Navy in World War II . Air Force in Korea . Then during the Vietnam War I handled a line of greeting cards . " Where ? " All over . Saigon . Da Nang . Qui Nhon . Nha Trang . Hue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was selling 1,200,000 cards a year there . Had twenty people working for me . Cleared about $120,000 a year on it . That 's how I got involved over here . My commissions were paid into an account at a Swiss bank . I had to come here to collect . " I tell him I did n't know the Vietnamese went in for greeting cards . " Not the Viets . The Americans ! Christmas . Mother 's Day . Girlfriends ' birthdays . ' Thinking of you . ' Toward the end I got into the contemporaries . " Ileave the American and cross the I reach the I3eatengasse without finding anything made in the United States of America . In neither the Globus nor the Jelmoli department stores is there even a thimble from America . On the grassy square where Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi ( 1746-1827 ) stands in a frock coat , educating a bronze ragamuffin , hope for the U.S. trade balance is buoyed by the presence of a busy McDonald 's . By Zurich standards , the prices give a deserved break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six Chicken McNuggets for SFr 4.20 . But I have to question whether any nation can close a $175 billion trade gap by exporting fast-food chains , and I continue my search . Finally , I find what may be the only retail product of an American factory available in Zurich : a flashlight called the Mini-Mag Lite . The Mini-Mag Lite sells for about $13 . I calculate that if every man , woman , and child on earth were to buy only two MiniMag Lites a year , every year until the end of time , our trade deficit would be practically eliminated . With the dollar falling like a rock , it is possible to watch the goods offered for sale on the Bahnhofstrasse appreciate before one 's eyes . In the window of Weinberg 's there is an unpretentious men 's calfskin parka for 6,850 francs , the equivalent of $4,707.90 ? investment clothing in the truest sense of the word . At 2:15 P.M. the franc/dollar rate drops from 1.4550 to 1.4425 . Much has been said of the power of mind over matter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of a leather jacket jumps $40.80 in a single instant , especially when the viewer of this phenomenon can remember a time when it was possible to buy a leather jacket in Switzerland for $40.80 . Meanwhile , next door at Koch Optik , a pair of night-vision goggles , already a bit pricey at 17,775 francs , suddenly goes $105.86 further beyond my scope . With life 's simple pleasures becoming less accessible by the moment , I feel a strong impulse to lock in the dollar cost of drowning my sorrows in bottle number 0611 of Ferte de Fartenay Grand Armagnac , vintage 1906 , at 693 francs or $480.42 at the afternoon exchange rate . But I opt to defer the purchase , in the hope that swift and decisive action on the U.S. budgetary deficit may lower the price of old brandy half a world away . With deathly suddenness , every material relation now seems arbitrary , and every certainty an overvalued doubt ; so I seek out Carl Alfred Meier . A professor emeritus of psychology , Meier holds the chair of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Institute of Technology . Meier lives on a tranquil street near the Kunsthaus museum . The wooden stairs to his flat are covered with oriental rugs secured by brass rods . He receives me in his solarium . The professor is in his seventies and appears to enjoy being old and wise . He smokes with relish , alternating between pipes and cigars . " I must warn you , " he begins , " 1 know nothing about economics . But this event presupposes that something in man 's psyche has broken down . People no longer believe what they always believed ? that the dollar , say , is worth so many Swiss francs . It is almost a religious catastrophe . There must be a tendency within the unconscious that breaks down old beliefs . Indeed , this situation has something of the quality of a religious collapse . You lose your security , you lose your convictions , you lose everything that is important for your existence . " People are calling it a panic . Do you know where the term originated ? It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply the Greek deity of fields and flocks . The name ' Pan ' is similar to the Greek word for ' The All , ' ' The Whole . ' Pan was revered in every village of the Mediterranean world . " At the close of antiquity , the crew of a ship sailing among the Eschinades Islands reported that they had heard a voice proclaim , ' Pan o megalos tetheke . ' Pan the greatest is dead . ' As this news spread , it caused confusion and disorder , In a word , panic . " As I leave Professor Meier 's , I run into the American . He looks five years older than he did the last time l saw him . I ask him how roasting the tail of his banker has gone . " Oh , forget that , " he says . " I 'm the one that got burned . I burned myself . They did n't sell me out at 11.90 . They did n't sell me out at all . " He seems unable to fill his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my head . " When I originally ordered ICI , it came in units of four shares . I bought 2,500 units . When I called the guy last week , I told him to sell 2,500 . So what did he do ? He sold 2,500 shares . I 've still got 7,500 shares ! It 's my fault . I gave him the wrong instructions . And the stock just keeps going down , down , down . You know what I am ? I 'm ruined , totally ruined . " I ask him why he does n't sell the remaining 7,500 and cut his losses . " Oh , I ca n't sell now , " says the American . " It 's much too low . It 's ridiculous . 1C1 is one of the biggest chemical companies in the world ! "
