Winter offensives begin in Washington and El Salvador <P> In El Salvador the new year opened with a bang that resounded in Washington . <P> Just as the White House made ready to battle on Capitol Hill to wrest perhaps as much as $175 million in military funds for the Central American nation , disheartening news came of a daring guerrilla offensive . On two year-end raids , leftist insurgents not only captured and held El Salvador 's fourth-largest military base for some eight hours but blew up the Cuscatlan suspension bridge , a span that had come to symbolize 20th century progress for Salvadorans . <P> U.S. officials insisted that there was nothing particularly ominous about the latest guerrilla successes in El Salvador 's four-year civil war . But U.S. advisers on the scene feel the rebels are improving as soldiers more rapidly than the government forces . During most of 1983 , the guerrillas dominated the fighting . The recent winter offensive proved to be especially ill-timed for the Reagan Administration . <P> If the White House requests $175 million in military aid , well above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stiff opposition when the Senate and House of Representatives reconvene on Jan. 23 . Congressional critics of U.S. policy in El Salvador were angered when the President used a pocket veto during the holiday recess to block a bill extending the requirement that the U.S. certify El Salvador 's progress in human rights and political reform before granting further aid . Last week 33 House Democrats filed suit in federal court charging that the President had acted unconstitutionally . The certification law will undoubtedly be resubmitted once Congress is in session . <P> The final shape of the Reagan Administration 's aid package is also bound to be strongly affected by the recommendations of the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Central America , led by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . The twelve-member panel , which visited all the countries in the troubled region , plans to release its report this week . Though debate within the commission is said to have echoed divisions in Congress and the American public , the group , by most accounts , has now agreed on a general approach for treating Central America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission appears to be unanimous in favoring continued U.S. military assistance and hefty infusions of economic-development funds , which alone could total $5 billion to $7 billion during the next five years . Panel members are said to agree that any aid must be tied to political and economic reforms . Such a linkage principle would exclude Marxist Nicaragua , but whether it would put pressure on El Salvador or Guatemala is not clear . The roles that regional negotiations and the U.S. military must play in bringing about stability are also open questions . But whatever the specific issues that remain to be resolved , the White House will find it difficult to ignore or discredit the Kissinger panel 's conclusions . <P> For the moment , the more immediate concern in Washington seemed to be how to hold the line in El Salvador . Buoyed by the reorganization of the Salvadoran high command last November , U.S. military aides argued that government forces " had turned the corner " in their struggle against the guerrilla armies of the five-member Farabundo Marti National Liberation       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
