Many Americans regard their furnaces and air conditioners in a mythical way as devices that magically blow hot or cold air instead of machines that operate according to logic and technology , a Princeton University anthropologist suggested Sunday . In a report to the American Association for the Advancement of Science , Willett Kempton said that perhaps a majority of Americans who own window air conditioners don ' t use the thermostats as intended by the manufacturers . Kempton ' s report on " Folk Models of Air Conditioning and Heating Systems " is based on interviews with people as well as on information gathered by devices connected to heating and cooling units to monitor how they are being used . What Kempton found is that most people think the thermostat control on their air conditioner works like a valve or a water faucet . Several people also have this idea about their furnaces . When an average American activates an air conditioner , he or she turns the thermostat all the way up , believing it works like opening up a faucet completely to fill a bathtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work like valves or water faucets , however , so having an air conditioner or furnance thermostat in an extreme position doesn ' t cause the unit to blow any more heat or cold than keeping the thermostat in a moderate position , Kempton said . Thermostats are meant to keep room temperature at a steady level and work on a principle of feedback . When a thermostat is set at 72 degrees , for example , it will shut off the heating or cooling unit once that temperature is reached . If the thermostat is turned to 80 degrees for a furnace or 60 degrees for an air conditioner , that just means the unit will keep running until it makes the room uncomfortably hot or cold , Kempton said . Still , most people turn their air conditioners to an extreme setting and then just turn off the unit when the room gets too cold , turning it on again once the room starts to warm up . " This is clearly not the intended operational mode , " Kempton said , " or the manufacturer would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than furnaces do , and Kempton suspects the reason is that very few air conditioner thermostats use that word on their label . One problem is that virtually no air conditioner thermostats are set at temperature readings such as 70 degrees . Instead , they usually have readings from 1 to 10 or Low to High , Kempton said . " Nonrecognition of the air conditioner ' s thermostatic control requires that the occupant expend additional management effort , " Kempton reported . " Some of our interviewees complained about having to get up and turn the unit on and off to keep an even temperature , " Kempton said . " Considering that these devices have been manufactured and sold for a quarter-century in this country , these findings are appalling . " Though people do waste a lot of effort running their air conditioners the wrong way , their misconceptions do have a bright point , Kempton noted , because it does lead to lower electrical bills . " People operating the air conditioner manually have been found to use less energy since they are more likely to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and need cooling for comfort , " he said.
