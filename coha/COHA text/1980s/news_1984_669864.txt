DETROIT  --  Back in the energy-conscious late 1970s , diesel engines looked like a boom waiting to happen . Analysts predicted that by 1985 as much as 25% of the U.S. passenger-car market would be diesel-powered . So Robert F. Humrick expanded his Fresno , Calif. , machine shop that built diesel fuel injectors . He also hired new mechanics and opened a fourth retail outlet . But instead of booming , the diesel sputtered . Sagging diesel sales in a generally weak car market caused about $190 , 000 of losses for Mr. Humrick in the past two years . A lot of other people who bet on the diesel boom have suffered , too . From manufacturers of specialized diesel parts to engine mechanics , thousands of people geared up for the predicted diesel-market explosion , only to see the market implode instead . The shock waves from the diesel engine ' s failure hit especially hard because there had seemed to be so many reasons to think diesels would be popular . Viewed from a 1979 gasoline line , with oil prices soaring and Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future . Backed by the immense spending and savvy marketing expertise of General Motors Corp. , there seemed to be little question that the diesel would enjoy a rosy future . But in the 1980s , gasoline prices fell . In many parts of the country , diesel fuel became more expensive than gasoline , while gasoline-powered cars were becoming more fuel efficient . At the same time , GM suffered a heavy dose of bad publicity about defects in its diesel engines . After peaking at 6. 1% of the new-car market in 1981 , diesels sank to 4. 4% in 1982 , 2. 2% in 1983 and a scant 1. 5% in the first five months of this year . " Diesels , " says David Healy , an auto analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , " are an idea whose time has passed . " The evidence of the diesel engine ' s boom and bust is scattered throughout America . As goes the diesel , so goes the glow-plug , a pocket-sized device that provides the initial heat that helps start diesel-car engines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Walter Genthe , president of three-year-old Hella North America Inc. , a subsidiary of the West German company , Westfaelische Metall Industries KG . Hella obtained a license and invested $500 , 000 in a Flora , Ill. , manufacturing line for glow plugs and other diesel components . Mr. Genthe anticipated supplying a burgeoning diesel-auto market with two million units a year of glow plugs and other parts . Now , he says , business is " miserable "  --  Hella ' s diesel parts sales are " down to a trickle " of under 100 , 000 units a year . " We ' ve tied up $500 , 000 and it just sits there , " he says . Stanadyne Inc . , Windsor , Conn. , projected in its 1980 annual report that more than 40% of all American passenger cars would have diesel engines by 1990 . To supply that booming demand , Stanadyne ' s diesel systems division opened two new plants in North Carolina to produce fuel injection devices for GM ' s diesel cars . The plants still are operating , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1981 , the diesel division ' s sales have plunged 25% , and operating profit sank 35% . " We don ' t design the car , we don ' t design the engine , so we ' re a little bit at the mercy of the consumer and the builder of the car , " says George J. Michel Jr . , Stanadyne ' s vice chairman and chief financial officer . Then there ' s Racor Industries , a Modesto , Calif. , maker of fuel-water separators for diesel engines . Racor ' s automotive sales jumped from zero in 1978 to 10 , 000 units a month in 1980 , the result of GM ' s big push to bring diesels to market . As Mark Richards , president and owner of Racor , puts it : " The GM engine wouldn ' t get out of the garage without one of our units . We just happened to be standing around , the only kid on the block with one . " Racor expanded operations to three work turns from one and hired 150 new workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8 million into a new plant  --  a big investment for a closely held company with annual sales of $15 million to $20 million . But between 1980 and 1983 , Racor ' s automotive sales plummeted to under $1 million from $3. 5 million . The company halved the work force . The retrenchment , along with continued success in the company ' s nonautomotive business , enabled Racor to survive and even expand a little last January . But Mr. Richards says , " It was a tough go there for about a year . " Mr. Humrick , the California businessman who geared up to sell and service more diesels , just finished closing the second of his four stores . In 1981 , he closed the addition to the repair shop , and he sold the extra machines a year later . GM took its lumps , too . Scores of owners of diesel-powered cars are suing the company over the defective engines and , as Mr. Humrick discovered , the value of GM diesel-powered cars on the used-car market has plunged . The $500 million diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making a mere 140 engines daily , about 9% of capacity . Temporary layoffs are frequent . The assembly line moves forward only once every three minutes or so. allowing some workers to take on what at peak production would be three or four separate jobs . " It ' s a good engine and people just aren ' t buying it , " complains Patrick Murphy , a rod hanger , as he idles at his post , waiting for the line to cycle again . But overall , says Mr. Healy , the auto analyst , GM fared better than many other companies that tried to ride the diesel bandwagon . Mr. Healy reasons that as people abandoned GM ' s diesels , they switched to GM ' s big gasoline-powered models , its bread-and-butter money makers . " This is something where ( GM ) cried all the way to the bank , " he says . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
