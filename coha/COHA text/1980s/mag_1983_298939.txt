LA TRAGDIE DE CARMEN Directed by Peter Brook <P> A conversation between Prosper Mrime and Georges Bizet , overheard in the smoking room of the Parnassus Club : <P> Mrime : And so , my friend , what do you think of the job this fellow Peter Brook has done with your Carmen " ! <P> Bizet : Excuse me , but I do not regard it as my Carmen . <P> Mrime : Oh , come . I admit there have been a few changes- <P> Bizet : A four-act work that takes nearly as many hours to perform is chopped to a single act of 82 minutes , the entire cast is reduced to four singers and two speaking parts , the plot and music are twisted around-a few changes indeed ! <P> Mrime : But all done , surely , according to a consistent principle . <P> Bizet : Yes . Vandalism . <P> Mrime : Brook prefers to describe it as a search for the essence , a stripping away of conventional trappings . He has turned the apron of the stage at Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , glaring lights , and on it he has traced the bleak geometry of the characters ' fates quite vividly . <P> Bizet : It is the fate of my other characters and my choral scenes that concerns me . And no offense to the 15-piece ensemble that the music director , Marius Constant , conducts at the rear of the stage and a bit off to the side , but I miss my big orchestra . <P> Mrime : For me , I must confess , the production has some of the concentrated impact of my original tale of Carmen . You know , the qualities that Nietzsche , just the other day , was saying you had drawn from me- " the logic in passion , the shortest line , the harsh necessity . " <P> Bizet : Nietzsche ! I sometimes think I have suffered more from that old bore 's praise than from the censure often others . <P> Mrime : You do n't object to my own Carmen being emphasized ? <P> Bizet : On the contrary . Much of what I can find good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen has become , for instance-still beguiling , but fiercer and more carnal . The deeper degradation of her simple soldier lover , Don Jos , through his murders of his officer and Carmen 's husband , which do not occur in my work . Even the way Don Jos 's rival , the bullfighter Escamillo , comes to grief instead of triumph in the end . <P> Mrime : You see , the immediacy , the reduced scale , the rotation of several young actor-singers in the major roles from night to night-five Carmens , five Don Joss and what have you-are merely Brook 's way of reconceiving your work in contemporary theater terms . <P> Bizet : But he implies that this is the way I would have written it had I been allowed to , or would write it today . <P> Mrime : Is n't it ? <P> Bizet : If Brook and his screenwriter-playwright collaborator , Jean-Claude Carrire , were to present me with this libretto now , yes , I might be intrigued . But I worked within quite different terms , the opra-comique 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental point that Brook has missed . <P> Mrime : Namely ?
