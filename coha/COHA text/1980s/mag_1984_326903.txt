The joys of CompuSex <P> One of the more bizarre aspects of America 's love affair with the personal computer is the growing popularity of CompuSex . This is a new form of erotic entertainment in which consenting computer owners exchange X-rated messages over the telephone lines . Anyone with a home computer can play , but the most active enthusiasts are found among the 110,000 subscribers of CompuServe , the country 's largest computer network . " Eighteen months ago , it was mostly lighthearted flirting , " says Dave Payton , a CompuServe regular from West Virginia . " Now people come out with all sorts of obscene propositions right on-line . " <P> The action begins at 6 p.m. , when CompuServe 's rates drop from $12 an hour to $6 , and is limited to the so-called CB channels , the computer version of Citizens Band radio . Each week thousands tune in to CB to chat with other users , and many of them end up on Channel 1 , the channel designated for adults . Sometimes 40 people will be on-line at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than the eye can read . " I 'm nibbling your earlobe , " begins a typical come-on . Reply : " Not so hard ! " Men , sporting such nicknames as " Conan the Librarian " and " Loverboy , " outnumber women about 4 to 1 , and anyone signing on as " Karen the Nympho " will be besieged with requests to TALK . This is the command that allows two users to exchange intimacies in private . Couples who hit it off have traded phone numbers , photographs and , on at least five occasions , wedding bands . Tiresome swains can be cut off with a keystroke . <P> " It 's a fascinating alternative to the normal courtship routine , " says Andrew Schlein , a psychology Ph.D . who signs on as " Psydoc . " He compares it to the experience of strangers thrown together in the cabin of an airplane , where closeness and anonymity allow an intimacy that might never happen in other circumstances . <P> Many computer buffs find these pleasures habit forming : about 200 CB users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy from reality . One 35-year-old woman grew so addicted to CompuSex that her husband walked out , complaining that she was neglecting him for her machine . She then hooked up with a series of online lovers who were either disappointing or disappointed when she met them in the flesh . Now , complaining that her life is a mess , she is organizing a support group for women having similar difficulties .
