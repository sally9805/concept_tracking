JOHANNESBURG , South Africa  --  " Neither my husband nor I have worked in six months , " a woman said plaintively on a South African radio call-in show recently . A sad chronicle ensued of a 47-year-old man who had lost his job as chief sales manager of a tobacco company when the concern went out of business . Strapped for money , he and his wife sold the family car to buy food for their nine children . " Things are rough all over , " the radio announcer brusquely replied before hurrying on to the next caller . Such tales have become daily grist for radio and newspapers as South Africa ' s economy sinks slowly but inexorably into a deep slump . Inflation is galloping at an 18% annual rate and consumer spending and investment levels are stagnant despite cuts in interest rates . Gross national product figures for the first quarter show the economy is shrinking at a 4. 5% annual pace . Barlow Rand Ltd. , the country ' s largest industrial group , says its subsidiaries are operating at less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in decades , South Africa faces a white unemployment problem . Among blacks , estimates of burgeoning unemployment range from 25% to 50% . The streets of Johannesburg are dotted with black men waving motorists toward empty parking spaces in the hope of receiving a few pennies . One man who received the equivalent of a half dollar for his service fell on his knees to thank the driver . Now white hobos have joined the ranks of men sleeping on the streets . About 600 whites have taken jobs as casual day laborers in the Johannesburg area at the rate of $2 a day , according to city officials . For the first time since the 1930s , whites are digging ditches alongside blacks . Last month the government unveiled a plan to stimulate the economy by pumping half a billion dollars into the hands of taxpayers . The package scattered cash across the economy : $40 million to drought-stricken white farmers , tax concessions to the motor industry , $300 million for low-cost housing and $120 million to individuals and companies to refund a tax surcharge that enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giveaway , business executives and economists doubt the government ' s ability to revive the ailing economy . " Consumers are despondent and aren ' t spending . The basic problem is lack of political confidence , " says Rob Lee , chief economist for South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. , better known as Old Mutual , the country ' s largest insurance and investment house . " There is a limit to what economic policy can do at this stage . " Other economists say that the package only recognizes the government ' s inability to stay within budgeted spending levels . " It makes a virtue out of necessity , " says one banker . The package will increase the government ' s projected deficit to at least $1. 6 billion this year , in part because of increasing defense expenditures and the duplication of bureaucracies for different races . Mr. Lee believes the actual deficit will approach $2. 8 billion . Moreover , the package does little for blacks , for whom the country ' s deep recession has been most severe . The housing portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slow to get off the ground . Most tax benefits will go to white individuals and corporations that pay the most taxes . The government , concerned that economic hardship is fueling unrest in the nation ' s black townships , hopes that benefits will trickle down to blacks through higher levels of economic activity in general . But the level of economic activity remains lackluster . At the end of last year , the government started to congratulate itself on an upturn in economic activity ; in the first quarter of this year , the trend fizzled . It now appears that South Africans rushed to make purchases before prices rose sharply in reaction to the South African currency ' s declining value . " The rise in activity last year was just a hot-air balloon , " says Nico Czypionka , chief economist for Standard Bank of South Africa . Overall business activity is just 78% of 1980 levels . Even if the economy was growing , it couldn ' t keep up with the pace needed to accommodate the increasing numbers of blacks and whites entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy must grow 4% to 5% annually just to keep black unemployment from growing worse . With the lack of investment by both foreigners and South Africans themselves , that sort of growth isn ' t likely . The lack of investor confidence in the economy can be easily measured by the country ' s dual exchange rate . The commercial rand is used for ordinary trade transactions . The financial rand is used for moving capital assets in and out of the country . The financial rand usually trades at a discount from the commercial rand in order to make investment in the country more attractive  --  and disinvestment less so . At the moment the financial rand is selling at a 42% discount from the commercial rand , one of the biggest discounts ever . To cope with economic stagnation , President P.W. Botha ' s Economic Advisory Council is promoting an idea it calls " inward industrialization , " which would tap pension and life insurance funds that have excess cash on hand .

With the rapid capital flight from South Africa , however , the government has little choice but to look inward . A debt-rescheduling agreement reached with major creditors drains about $2 billion from South Africa over 12 months , according to Reserve Bank figures . Bankers estimate that another $2 billion is lost through illegal transfers of foreign currency , ranging from over-invoicing by the foreign parents of South African companies , to private smuggling of Krugerrand gold coins .
