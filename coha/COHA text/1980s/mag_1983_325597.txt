Bill Ledford , editor of the weekly paper in Vidalia , Ga. , popped into the Vidalia Chamber of Commerce the other day with an idea about a porcelain onion . He told Dick Walden , the executive vice president of the Chamber , that he had met an artist in Charleston , S.C. , and that he harbored a notion to commission her to fire him up some onions . " She makes squash , beans , everything , " said Ledford , a little excitement rising in his voice . " She even makes an onion , " he continued , " but it does n't look like our onion . It 's not flat and squatty enough . " <P> Ledford , his eye on a buck , would like to market the artificial onion . The thing was , he explained , he wanted to put the registered trademark of the Vidalia sweet onion , a cartoonish character called the Yumion ( sort of the Pillsbury Doughboy of the onion racket ) , on his product , and for that he needed permission from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the next board meeting , but he suspected Ledford " could bank on it . " The editor bounded out , a happy man . <P> Onion , onion , onion is all the word around here . If one has not yet heard of the Vidalia sweet onion , one will . In the past few years , knowledge of its succulence has table-hopped through gourmet circles all over the land . The Vidalia ( pronounced Vy-dale-yuh ) is status , and with its fame has come its nemesis : imitators . " The imitators are unscrupulous , " says Walden . " I fully expect to hear somebody 's packaging cabbages out there and calling them Vidalia onions . " <P> Jody Powell , writing in the Dallas Times Herald , puts the blame for the rise of onion fraud partly on the Carter Administration : " It started in 1977 when we Georgians descended on Washington and were overheard whispering at embassy receptions , state dinners and Cabinet meetings about suppliers , shipments and prospects for the year 's crop . This attracted the attention of gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelves of the Georgetown Safeway , the supermarket of the elite where you 're embarrassed to shop if you 're not wearing tennis togs or jodhpurs , depending on the season . " <P> Dealers from Alabama , Florida , Texas and other parts of Georgia are marketing their onions as Vidalia onions . The reason is simple : the Vidalia , because it is mild and because it has become enormously popular , fetches as much as three times the price of ordinary onions . The Vidalia is a yellow Granex type F-1 hybrid , a variety grown throughout the country . Grown elsewhere , however , the same onion can bring tears to the eyes . Grown here , it is called sweet-and is . The former presidential press secretary contends it will not make " your nose run , your heart burn , or your sweetheart gag . " ( In fairness , it should be pointed out that other localities , like Walla Walla , Wash. , also produce a sweet onion . Tests have shown that the sugar content in the Vidalia is highest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate and the paucity of sulfur in the sandy soil here. )
