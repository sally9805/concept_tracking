 | somewhere , long-legged coeds blooming out of jeans and sneakers . A songbird mocked him , and he yearned for her . Since she had left , all the world was empty . The phone was ringing when he reached his office door . " Martin Rablon ? " His heart paused because the cool music of her voice could have been Jayna 's . " The computer sci-entist ? " " I teach computer science . " " I 'm Megan Drake . With the Raven Foundation . We need advice on a new direction in computers . " Jayna had never even tried to understand them . " Professor , are you available for a consultation ? " " Sure . " Another new escape , and he felt grateful for it . " After commencement ? " That black , never-ending nightmare chasm . He sank into it , sank forever . Who am I ? Wordless urges ached and burst inside him . What place is this ? All he knew was darkness , stillness , bottomless infinity . That and a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , in his face and his feet . Still he sank  --  or was he really somehow floating ? Searching , he found no sense of motion or support , no clue to time or place , no glint of light , no hint of anything beyond that prickling pressure that was n't quite even a pain . It pressed and pressed , swelling inside him , heavy everywhere , until he thought he could n't endure it . Yet when he tried to struggle , every effort seemed to close it tighter , its gray chill aching always deeper . He found no way to end it . Still he sank or maybe floated through that soundless , stifling dark , touching nothing , all his body frozen  --  if he really had a body  --  without breath or even need for breath . That itself became a haunting riddle . How was he alive ? The blunt throb beat , beat , beat , until he was glad to let it hammer him back into the vacant dark . He sat with a margarita by the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilled his face when the fat man dived , and a sun glint stabbed his eyes . Turning to shield them , he saw the girl striding behind the sleek-haired manager through the mostly empty tables . They were looking for him .  | " Senor Brink ? Mees Drake . " " Megan Drake . " He liked her , even in the dark sunglasses . Vigorous and tall , her hair burnished red under the sun . She smiled to thank the manager , who had lingered as if for a tip . Waiting for him to go , she took off the glasses . Her eyes delighted him , greenish gray and very clear . " You are Don Brink ? " Nodding , waving the manager away , he reached to pull up a chair . With a fleeting glance at his leg , she sat . " The  --  the mercenary soldier ? " " Please ? " He had to frown . " If you 're media , I do n't talk about my work . " " I 'm not media . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be skittish about publicity . I 'm with the Raven Foundation . Down here for a biogenics convention . I happened to hear about you , and I think we have a job ? " " Afraid you 're a little late . " With a wry shrug , he moved the leg . " You 've been wounded ? " Sudden emotion widened her eyes . " We were n't told . " " A mortar splinter . Still lodged in the knee . " Painfully , he grinned . " Dysentery , too , and recurrent malaria . The medics tell me I 've fought my last war . " " Maybe not . " She paused to weigh him . " We were told you command unusual fees because you earn them . " " I tried to . While I could . " " You 'll do . " A quick smile lit her lean , angular face . " If you want the job . " He shook his head . " In the fix I 'm in ? " " No matter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and clean . Like the lilacs he remembered blooming in the untended yard around the parsonage in springs when he was still a child . " Not to us . If you can come to our Albuquerque lab for a consultation ? " She was gone . Again he was awake , at least half awake , still adrift in that boundless dark . Again he strained for sound , for any sense of place or time , but all he could find was inside himself . All he knew was that dull depression throbbing forever in his head and the stinging numbness that gripped him everywhere . When he fought to move himself , new needles of pain stabbed into his deadness.  | But his fingers flexed ! His toes curled . Stiff wrists began to yield , and stiffer elbows bent , Painfully , he tried to reach out into the suffocating dark . His unfeeling fingers found something hard and slick and cold that walled him in , beside and above and even beneath . Something coffin close , A wave of terror chilled him . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no sense of suffocating , was he even alive ? The phone caught him working late at the lab terminal , running Biowand programs to build and test model virus models , searching for one that might have saved his wife and Roger . Too late for them , but others might be cured . Absorbed in the dancing patterns of possible life and annoyed at the call , he let it ring . It kept on till he gave up . " What d' you want ? " " Dr. Tomislav ? " A girl 's voice , soft and clear as Olga 's once had been . " The biologist ? " " Ivan Tomislav , " he muttered . " I do biology . " " Well enough to win the Nobel . " Recalling Olga and the Yiddish lullaby she used to croon when she was nursing Roger , he could n't hang up . " I 'm Megan Drake . With the Raven Foundation . We were warned not to bother you at work , but we 're trying something very new in genetic engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Albuquerque for a consultation ? " Again , the icy , everlasting dark . Still he floated in it , floated nowhere , still shut inside those narrow walls . Stiffly , fighting stabbing agony in every joint , he reached to feel for any opening , any clue , any device that might set him free . All he found was slick and seamless hardness . His tingling hands fell back , and he found his own flesh . His naked hips , his flanks , the flatness of his belly . Himself ? All his body felt cold and slick as that coffin wall , oddly numb to his dull fingers . He groped again , lower . No balls or penis . Nor labia , either . Not even hair . All he found was smooth and strangely hard , more like metal than flesh . What sort of thing had he become ?  | Recoiling from the shock , from the pain of loss and the riddle of it , he strove again for answers . All he could recall was those shattered scraps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had they been more than dream ? Still starkly vivid to him , they had the feel of actual recollection . He clung to Megan 's image . Her fine lean features , her greenish-gray eyes , her vital eagerness . She must be , must have been real . But  --  himself ? Was he  --  could he have been Martin Rablon ? Or Don Brink ? Or Ivan Tomislav ? All of them ? That made no sense . If she had really called them , or any of them , for a consultation at the Raven Foundation , what could that have been about ? Searching , all he found was the baffling dark . His fingers strayed back to his naked crotch . " Dr. Galen Ulver ? " Startled , he looked up from the half-assembled model rocket on the workbench and found her in the open doorway of the garage . " Forgive me for breaking in . " Her voice erased his brief annoyance . " It seems you have no phone . " " Nobody to answer it now . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the little rocket . " Building toys . " He shrugged a little ruefully , grinning at the bench . " They 're better than alcohol or suicide . In fact , I kid myself that they 're really more than toys . The best I can do since NASA scrubbed the fusion engine . To me , they 're designs for starcraft that ought to be built . " He waited to see what she wanted . " Megan Drake . " In casual slacks , without makeup , briskly direct , she looked stunning in spite of herself . He wished he had been forty years younger . " With the Raven Foundation . " " What 's that ? " " We 're privately endowed , " she said . " For a very special project . We 've studied the research reports you used to publish . A shame your funds were cut off , but we 're still interested in fusion propulsion . If you have time to talk about it ? " " Time ? All I have left . "  | She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Her arresting eyes came gravely back to him . " Wonderfully made . " Her tone cheered him . " But I think we can get you a good deal closer to the stars . " The promise took his breath . " If you can come with me to our Albuquerque lab for a consultation ? " He woke to the ache of haunting loss , fingers still against that hairless , sexless slickness . Shuddering , striving to understand , he groped for more of Megan Drake . He recalled no consultation , nor anything else . Why ? Was the memory gone because he had loved her once and could n't love her now , because the pain of his mutilation was too severe to be endured ? He found no way to know . Again he searched his prison . That first tingling numbness had eased a little , and his stiffened limbs moved more freely . Hands braced against those cold , close walls , he turned himself and found a break . A seam , almost too fine for his touch to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his head back toward his feet . Escape ? Eagerly , he ran his fingertips once more along it , back and forth all across it . Nothing else . No knob or catch or lock or hint of any way to open it . He let his hands fall back and found another riddle . A cable , a little thicker than his thumb . It came from somewhere below him , and his turning had twisted it around him . Hard and slick as metal , yet stiffly flexible , it felt oddly like his strange new skin . It was faintly warm , pulsing slowly where he grasped it . His fingers followed it around his hips , on to his belly . It fastened to him there , where his navel should have been . His own umbilical cord ? Was the cell no coffin , but a womb ? An hour out of Kansas City , a stewardess brought the note to him . Captain Wardian , may I speak to you ? At your convenience . About your career as an American astronaut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . A moment of your time will be enough . It was written in a firm but feminine hand on a stiff , buffcolored letterhead expensively embossed in indigo ink :  | RAVEN FOUNDATION . MEGAN DRAKE , DIRECTOR . The address was Albuquerque . It was signed Megan Drake . " You 'll be sorry if you do n't see her , sir . " The stewardess grinned at him , a friendly malice on her sun-freckled face . " The type you like . She 's in first class , by the empty aisle seat . " " Tell her when we 're on the ground . " On the ground in Kansas City , he went back to meet Megan Drake . When she rose to offer her vigorous hand , he was n't sorry . " I think we need you , captain . " He sat down to listen , pleased with the red glint of her clean hair and her lean grace of motion . " A moment will do . We 've checked out your records , but I 'd like you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Masters in astronomy at Cal Tech . A NASA-trained astronaut . " Her clear eyes grew graver . " How come you 're flying now for Delta ? " " I 've had my turn in space . " He shrugged . " One 's all you get since they 've cut the budgets back , and I like this better than a Pentagon desk . " " If you still care about space ? " She paused to survey him again , and he enjoyed the glow of her approval . " I 'm pretty sure we can offer you something better yet . If you 'd like to come out to our Albuquerque lab for a consulta-tion ? " He woke with both hands loosely clasping the cord , as if to climb . It felt warm and alive to his fingers , pulsing as if it pumped something . Blood ? Or did he need blood now ? Blood or something stranger , it was his life . The reason , perhaps , that he felt no need to breathe . But what kind of life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark to find that narrow seam . His touch , he thought , had become more sensitive , that prickling numbness nearly gone . He traced the mark again and found a slight bulge on the surface beside it . Here , the way ! Without quite knowing why , he doubled his fist . He hit the bulge and thought it gave a little to the blow . He felt the seam . Still no wider . Shuddering , dimly alarmed , he struck the bulge again . Harder . Again and yet again . Still no sound , but he felt the fissure widen . Light !  | right points flashed and vanished . Diamond hard . Dimensionless . The slit grew wider , and they slid very slowly across it . He saw they were stars , the sky behind them queerly black . When he could , he pushed himself outside . And fell into stunning wonder . A night sky , black and blazing , with no horizons anywhere . Unwinking stars , in swarms he had never imagined , seeming strangely near . The Milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black dust , rolling all around him . No up or down or sane direction . Head spinning , he wanted the shelter of his dark birthplace , but it was drifting away . He clutched for its walls , but he had no weight , no purchase on anything . It slid out of reach . Dizzy and ill , he had to close his eyes . Panic chilled him . For this was interstellar space . Airless , empty , alien . Any matter here would drop toward the absolute zero . Nothing living could survive , not without support equipment . Yet somehow , somehow not even breathing , he was still alive . Grappling with that stunning riddle , he clutched at his belly and found the cord . Still attached , it trailed him out of that hard-walled womb . Still a little warm , still slowly pulsing . The secret of his life  --  if this was actual life . He let his fingers caress its hard , pliant slickness . His foot struck something , clung . He opened his eyes and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the stars . The rest yellow , gleaming dully where light struck . A thin golden arrow . Maybe five times his own body length , so slender his arms would reach half around it . Its tiny size jolted him . Too small . Too small for space . His own birthcell filled the nose , that vital cord trailing out of the blackness inside its glistening lips . The cord was golden . His own body was , when he looked . His flesh sleek , hairless as the golden hull , shining with the same dull gleam where the light struck . The skin of his forearm felt stiff but elastic , yielding to his testing fingers . Neither warm nor cold . Somehow unharmed by the vacuum or the unshielded radiation he felt burning on him . A different stuff than Than what ? He shuddered , shrinking from the riddles of his being . He felt human . His hairless hand looked like a metal casting when he turned it in the light , but humanly patterned , complete with a strong-nailed thumb and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried it , the pain gone now . Human ? In those broken and confusing dreams in which Megan Drake had always been inviting him to a consultation at the Raven Foundation , he had always been normally human enough to desire her Chilled , he could n't help looking down . The coiling cable shone yellow , but his crotch was in the dark . He turned his body to the light , to see the naked hairless gleam where his genitals should have been . Quickly , ill and trembling with the ache of loss , he looked away . Looked at his feet . Human , five toed , bare to the bitterness of space , they shone like old gold and clung to the skin of the ship . Somehow magnetic . He could walk the narrow hull . Careful with his slender life line , he stepped toward the tapered tail . It ended with a cluster of rocket nozzles on which the gold had tarnished blue . They were dead . He felt no acceleration . Yet the little ship was moving . Flying fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , he looked to find the light . A star , so near it shone brighter than all the rest together . He studied it and found his vision changing . The far white point became a tiny disk . He made out fainter points above and below it , four that formed one straight row . Planets . Planets of the sun ?  | Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune ? Could they be ? He shivered to a thrill of hope . Megan , in those shattered bits of whatever , had been promising not herself but space . Was the strange machine a creation of her Raven Foundation ? A lifecraft , perhaps ? And he  --  had he been a crewman on some lost interstellar expedition , his body somehow transformed to survive in space ? A lone survivor now returning home ? He swung to search for clues . A giddy flicker ; he had to wait for his telescopic vision to shift again before he could see the fainter stars . The galactic clouds of distant fire and dust looked just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist and burning points had to be the Pleiades , but its shape was strangely changed . Working away from it , he found a great red star that surely was Aldebaran but strayed far from where it should have been . He found the twisted Hyades , once so near it , and a ragged Iine of brighter stars  --  could they have been the Ursa Major cluster ? Peering behind , the way the little ship must have come , he searched for home . Again his vision shifted . Remote stars leapt apart , abruptly brighter . Blue stars , red stars , some of them doubles , most too bright or too faint , the yellow too yellow . None looked like the Sun . How long  --  he shivered again . How long had the ship been in space ? He felt afraid to guess . For the stars themselves had crept away from where he had known them . Seen from here , wherever this was , the constellations had reshaped themselves . With the time in flight unknown , even its first direction uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all he could hope to recall  --  if he could hope to recall anything sane . The builders of the ship would be dust by now , their science and purpose long forgotten . The world could have become a paradise , perhaps for evolving supermen . Or mankind could be a million years extinct . He could never even hope to know . They were totally alone , falling into the bright star ahead . Turning slowly toward it , he thought he had begun to understand himself . Whatever the science of his creation ,  | whatever the energies that supported his awareness and his motion now , he was more than passenger or crewman . He was part of the ship , his duty to save and to serve it . Their danger was shocking , now that his altering vision had begun to reveal it . They were shooting straight into that white and tiny-seeming disk , already moving far too fast and still accelerating to its gravity . Without control , the rockets dead , with nothing to be done . Or was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? Had his birth , his awakening , somehow been triggered by the danger ? Perhaps by some sensor that detected the star 's increasing radiation ? Had he been born from that dark metallic womb to save the ship ? Born perhaps with graver defects than his missing genitalia ? And all alone , with none to tell him what he must do ? Very slowly , the hull was tumbling . Gathering the golden cord into loops to keep it from fouling anything , he followed the sunlight around the spinning hull , paying out the cord as he walked , looking for trouble . He found it . A ragged hole punched through the shining skin at the waist of the ship , the metal burned black around it . A hole no larger than the ball of his thumb , but the gold-filmed metal was thinner here than at the nose ; the wound had gone through into a dark cavity . The meteor must have been tiny , perhaps microscopic , vaporized on impact . Stooping , he found a narrow seam that ran close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He turned five recessed bolts that secured the door , but still it would n't open . Welded at the edge , he decided , by that old explosion . He tugged again , failed to lift it . Scowling into nowhere , he somehow saw what to do . Vaguely astonished by his own know-how , he slapped his left hand over the hole to make a ground connection . Drawing power from the ship , he touched the hull with one golden finger and drew it slightly back to strike a cutting arc . Its blaze dazzled him for an instant until his vision compensated . Moving the forefinger , he sliced along the welded edge until he could lift the door . The space below looked black at first . When his eyes had adjusted again to the diffuse star-glow and the reflection from his body , he could see the circuit boards of the main computer , closely stacked to fill the narrow hold . Though  | at first he saw no damage , they must have been struck by fragments from the explosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-packed supercubes looked unharmed at first , until his special senses sharpened . He found a ruined cube then , and another beside it , where hot metal droplets had splashed them . Microprocessors and memory cubes were dead . His missing sex organs  --  they must have been part of the loss . Ignoring the stab of pain where his penis should have been , he groped for what to do and found a program of action emerging in his mind . With it , a dim recollection of spare microprocessors and spares for a few key memory cubes under a hatch in the floor of his birthcell . Almost machinelike , he followed the program , removing cubes , testing and replacing them , until that first board was functional . He replaced it and ran another test . Still the ship was dead . He pulled the second circuit board , the third , a dozen others , discarding ruined cubes until all the spares were gone . Some had been duplicates , but others were not . Thousands of lost kilobytes of memory could never be recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and the one below it . They , too , had been scarred by hot fragments , probably damaged , but he could replace no more . The ship was crippled beyond complete repair , though not yet entirely dead " Egan ? " Megan 's voice . " Where are you ? " He wondered how he had heard her because here there was no air to carry sound . Yet it was her voice , coming from somewhere , sounding small and frightened . " Megan ? " He whispered her name , or thought he did . " Megan ? " " You are n't Egan . " He thought she seemed afraid of him . " Who are you ? " " I do n't know who I am . Or what . I just woke up on a strange starship  --  a very little ship  --  somewhere out in space . I do n't know where . Or when  --  I think a lot of time has passed . But I do n't know  --  I do n't know anything . " Terror touched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He waited , trembling . " Mister ? " At last , she answered , uncertainly and faintly , as if from far away . " I 'm sorry you 're in trouble ,  | but I do n't know you . I never saw a spaceship , and I do n't know who you are . . . " Her frightened voice trailed away . " Megan , where are you ? " " At Uncle Luther 's ranch . To stay till mother gets better . But Uncle Luther is n't here . There 's only Jesus and old Dolores . They sleep in the bunkhouse , too far to hear us . The thunder woke me up , and all the lights are out , and I ca n't find Egan 's room , and I stubbed my toe in the dark ? " He thought he heard her crying . " Megan ? " He tried to call again . " Megan , can you help me talk to anybody ? " He waited , squatting beside the access door . The little ship tumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy and then a golden glow once more . No answer came .  | He was closing the door when another memory woke . M egan Drake met him at the Albuquerque airport . " Dr. Tomislav ! " He heard her voice before he saw her . " I 'm driving you out to the lab . " He picked up his bag and followed her out to a red sports car . She drove it fast but expertly , saying very little to him . Pleased with her , he sat wondering about the Raven Foundation . Near the mountains east of the city , she took a narrow road that twisted south between brown and barren hills until they reached a tall chain-link gate . Grinning warmly at her , a guard there swung it open to let them through . " The foundation . " She nodded at a row of low buildings ahead . " We bought the site from Omega . A hush-hush outfit . They used to contract subassemblies for military nukes till something bigger swallowed them . " " Listen , Miss Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't said what you want to consult me about . If it 's anything military , I 've a rule of my own . Not to do it . Not for anybody . " " No problem . " He liked her easy smile . " We are n't military . " She parked on a gravel drive beside a long building that looked like stuccoed adobe . " Our guests stay here , " she said . " A sort of barracks . Nothing plush , but we have security . Meals next door . Conchita cooks Mexican and American . Her Mexican 's excellent if you care for that . Hope you do . The American ? " She shrugged .  | " I 've got to know what you want , " he said . " Why so much security if you are n't military . " " Nothing sinister . " Her face grew graver . " I like to feel , in fact , that our project could grow into the grand climax of human evolution . At least here on Earth . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it outside the fence . The press would blow it into nonsense , and the backwoods are still full of fanatics who would accuse us of offending their tribal God . " Her greenish eyes narrowed . " You 'll remember not to talk ? " " Sure . " She was moving to leave the car , but he sat still . " When I know what not to talk about . " " Okay . " She settled back beside him . " I imagine you never heard of Luther Raven ? " " Not that I recall . " " My uncle . A financier  --  my brother used to call him an international gambler . Mostly in grain and oil and ships to carry them . Piled up his billions very privately and finally felt guilty about them . Endowed the foundation as a kind of atonement . " To realize Egan 's dream . " Her eyes lifted toward the bare mountains , now turning red at sunset . " Egan was my twin brother . A crazy kid , but I adored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vexed our uncle because he never earned a dime or finished anything he started . Finally killed himself , climbing a difficult alp without a guide . But I loved him ? " He heard sadness in her falling voice . " His dream  --  it can make up for everything . " Still she watched the high summit . " Egan was n't a happy man . I 'm not sure he ever knew why . Went to shrinks and never believed what they told him . Quarreled with a lot of people because he got vehement with his own ideas and too short with skeptics . He met a lot of skeptics because his notions so often upset people . " He used to say the whole human race was a kind of being . With a sort of group mind , existing somehow in the unconscious mind of everybody . He thought it had lived a life of its own since human evolution began . " We 're grown up now , ' he used to say . It 's time for us to seed . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | we had outgrown the Earth . Thought we had a space instinct , driving us to leave it and look for new planets . He 'd come to believe that most of our troubles  --  everything from mental illness to war and terrorism  --  were only symptoms of our racial frustration because we had n't got away . " That 's how his dream began . " Her grave eyes had come back to him . " Mostly he kept it to himself , because so many people laughed , but he always shared everything with me . He used to talk about colonies on the moon or Mars or out in space until he decided they were n't real solutions . " What he saw at last was a way to sow the human seed on a larger field , farther off . On the worlds of other stars ? " She had seen Tomislav 's growing doubt . " Please . " She raised her hand to stop his question . " I know the notion turns people off , because it 's nothing they 've ever thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have considered it too impossible . But Luther bought the notion  --  he was no scientist , either . A surprise to his lawyers and even to me when we found the endowment in his will . With a paragraph to say it was a payment on a debt he owed mankind . " So here we are . " Bent intently toward him , she gestured at the row of drab prefabs and then at the sunset sky . " Refitting the old Omega shops and labs . Designing the seed machines and the vehicles that will lift them into orbit and launch them toward new worlds . " We 're going to scatter our seed across the stars . " He sat blinking at her . " It 's not all that impossible , " she said . " In fact , we 're already writing contract specifications for a lot of the basic components . Though we 've still got big problems ahead . That 's why we need you .

Nearly all will surely be wasted . Most will fall on barren soil , if they reach any soil at all . Maybe none will ever grow ; we ca n't even be certain the right sort of planets exist anywhere . But we must try  --  that was Egan 's vision . If we 're able to replant mankind on only one  | new world " ? her shining eyes were back on the mountain ? " human evolution will not have been in vain . " He held his questions , waiting for her to go on . " Seedships , we call them . " She turned back to him . " Designed to survive flights that can take almost forever , searching the galaxy for habitable planets . The ship will be partly mechanical but also partly organic . A new invention in evolution if we can perfect it . We need genetic engineers to help us get the human genes into computer code and out again ? " The bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wiser , he looked down at the small gold hull . That new invention , half machine and half alive , one of all those hundreds , built back on Earth he could n't even guess how long ago . Dead since the meteor struck its computer brain center but revived  --  at least enough to bear him  --  by its approach to the star ahead . His vision adjusted to let him study its four giant planets . Jupiterlike , they offered no possible haven . Even their moons , if they had moons , would be airless snowballs , with no fit soil for the seed of man . But perhaps , he thought , there might be an Earthlike planet , too small and near the star even for his telescopic eyes . A fallow world waiting for a new humanity . If the ship could land . If the damaged seed would grow . If he could defend it from whatever hazards No longer feeling quite so strange , he walked back to inspect the Ulver engines again . They looked intact . He found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the inspection door just below them . Opening that , he discovered an internal tank with a sealed cap he could reach . But no gauge , no indicator , nothing to tell him whether the little motors might ever burn again . There would be pumps and injectors to feed fuel through the lasers into the jets . After the disaster , and so many ages since , would all that intricate gear still work ? " Ship to Defender . " Speaking again in his mind , the voice was strangely changed . Still somehow faintly Megan 's , it was emotionless , coldly precise . " Propulsion equipment undamaged . "  | " Megan ? " Bewilderment chilled him . " Where are you ? " " Location in space , off unidentified stellar object . Coordinates unknown . " " Megan ? " He tried again . " Are n't you Megan Drake ? " " Term Megan Drake not identified , " it answered . " We are Ship Control Program . " " Then who am I ? " " Term I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden hull , clinging to the warm and throbbing cord that bound him to it , he strove to understand . Ship control must be the computer the meteor had hit , Megan 's voice built into it  --  her voice and that scrap of frightened recollection from her childhood . Alive again since his effort at repair , yet still crippled . Vital memory cubes and circuits lost , perhaps forever . He was the Defender , born of the ship , designed to serve and guard it . That at least seemed clear . His mind had come out of its computer , filled with bits of skill and power recorded to fit him for his mission . His life  --  a mode of life he had never imagined  --  still flowed from it , pulsing through the golden cord . Yet in spite of all such wonders , he had been born defective . Naked , bare and slick and shining , where he should have been a man . And Megan  --  his longing for her was still alive , and he had heard her frightened voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , all he found was numbing desolation . The ship was n't Megan ; she must have died back on Earth , perhaps ten thousand centuries ago . Anyhow , he was no longer designed for sex . He tried to shake that aching sadness off . Those old emotions were only faults in the Defender , chance hazards to his duty now . He tried to gather himself . " Defender to Ship , " he asked in his mind , " can you get us to some planet ? " " Negative . " " But we 've got to find a planet . A friendly world where we can land and plant mankind . There has to be a way . " " Negative . " " Why negative ? " " Drive power lost . " " Then we 've got to restore it . What will that require ? "  | An image of Megan flickered in his mind . Lean features framed in red-glinting hair . Lovely for an instant , though stark with shock , the green-gray eyes fixed in blank bewilderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across exploding darkness . Hearing nothing , he tried again . " How can we operate the engines to reach a planet and land there ? " " Computer malfunction . " Almost Megan 's , the whisper came faintly out of the dark . " Computer malfunction ? " " What is the malfunction ? " " Circuits interrupted . " " Interrupted where ? " Silence again while her troubled face flashed and shattered . " Malfunction located . " A dying breath . " Board E-One . " " Can it be repaired ? " When no answer came , he bent to open the access door . H e hated the cane , but he had to use it , limping off the plane at Albuquerque . He hated the bad knee when he had to let Megan Drake carry his bag out of the terminal to the little red car . Hated himself for getting too old and too slow for the game .  | Megan looked very young and very lovely even in the casual tan slacks , and she handled the bag with athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , he wished bitterly that he could skip back to her generation . " I 'm driving you right out to the lab , " she told him . " We 've living quarters there ? " " Let 's have dinner on the way . " He spoke on impulse . Because he wanted to forget the knee and his age and his own dim future . Because she was so wonderful . Distress swept him when he saw her head begin to shake . " Could n't we try the Penthouse Club ? " he asked quickly . " A posh place , I understand . A client of mine gave me a card that ought to get us in . " Surprised , her eyes weighed him . " A chance for us to talk . " He urged her . " You 've never told me anything about the war you 're hiring me to fight . " In spite of him , the bitterness shadowed his voice . " Or how you can think I 'm fit to fight . " " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't discuss our project outside the lab , but I do need to know you better , Mr. Brink . " " Ca n't you make it Don ? "  | She made it Don , and her impulsive smile warmed him . On the top floor of a downtown building , the Penthouse Club was posh enough but not too posh to let them in . Waiting for a table , they went into the bar . At first , she said she seldom drank , but she seemed to enjoy her margarita when it came . Though he wanted urgently to know her better , their talk began awkwardly . She was slow to talk about herself , and he felt naked when she wanted to know about him . " Mr. Brink ? " She paused , frowned at him oddly . " Don , if you 'd rather  --  I 've never known anybody like you . We talked at Acapulco , and of course we 've checked you out . But I 'd like to know how you got into  --  into your profession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How I got to be a killer ? " He saw her shock . " You like the word ? " " I fight . " He was deliberately blunt , testing her responses . " For pay . I fight men hired to kill me . Killing men gets to be a game . The most exciting and demanding game there is . " Her greenish eyes wide , her face was a study in appalled fascination . When she said nothing , he grinned and con-tinued : " Down at Acapulco , I was feeling pretty bad , thinking I might never be able to play it again . I 'm anxious to know how you imagine I can . " " Later . " Sipping her margarita , she paused to lick the salt . " I rather like it . " When her eyes returned to him , he saw a glint of amusement . " I 'll promise not to get you into the media if you 'll tell me what made you what you are . " Her directness jolted him . " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his drink in his hand and set it back untasted . " Or if I do , it 's something I do n't like to talk about . It hurts . " She sat waiting till he went on . " I was a preacher 's son . " He shook his head , flinching from the memory . " In a little Bible belt town . An only kid , in a tough situation . Because the preacher 's son has to be a model . I took that for granted . Tried hard enough . At least through high school . " Enjoying her close intentness , he wanted her to like him . " Sometimes it really was n't all that bad . Class work was easy . I liked sports . Little League . Later , track and corn- petitive swimming . Chess , too , after I learned to play . I always liked games I could win . " Her face changed a little , and she was n't quite so close . " My senior year , I fell in love . Puppy love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . But agony for me because I knew I did n't have a chance . The girl was named Virgie Ellen . A year older than I was , because I 'd skipped a grade . " Dazzling , to me ? " Eyes on Megan , he saw Virgie Ellen again ; the creamy skin , the tempting swell of her breasts . Felt her in his arms at the senior prom , holding him so tight she took his breath . Felt the magic of her hair against his cheek and inhaled her strong perfume . He found himself silent , Megan still intent . " Not a chance ? " Recollections were rushing back , and he hoped they would n't offend her . " All through high school , Virgie Ellen had gone steady with Walt Montalbert . His father was a deacon in the church and a millionaire banker . The wedding was going to be in my father 's church . " The night before , I was alone in the parsonage . My folks were away overnight , gone to a revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about midnight , tossing pebbles at my bedroom window . When I got it open , she held up her arms for me to help her in . I ? " The surge of old emotion checked him until he saw Megan 's understanding nod . " I did n't know what to think . Too far overwhelmed , in fact , to think at all . I 'd never dared tell Virgie Ellen how I felt about her , though I guess she must have seen it . A few times I 'd found her looking hard at me , with a quirky little smile she had , and wondered what she was thinking . " The room was dark , of course , except for light from the street . I remember that quirky smile and her finger on her lips . I do n't think I had breath to speak , because she was stripping off her clothes . I 'd never seen a naked woman , and I remember how stunning she was . Strutting a little when her bra and panties were off . Turning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisty smile . Turning to a laugh as she spread her naked arms for me ? "  | He paused again , self-conscious and rueful ; again Megan nodded . " My first sex . " Leaning to listen , Megan looked as lovely now as he recalled Virgie Ellen . Wondering what her own life was like and how she could feel such interest in him , he had to fend off a pang of new desire . " My first ? " His voice had slowed . " Maybe the best . A night I might have dreamed if people had n't taught me such dreams were sinful . She ripped off my shorts  --  that 's all I wore to bed . Pushed me back across the blanket and fell on top of me . A sort of rape because I had no notion what to do . But I went crazy about it when she showed me . " In his mind , the experience was all real again . The budding magic of Virgie Ellen . The feel of her hot flesh . The creak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were away . The scent of her hair and her hot breath , of their sweat and his semen . " I never knew why she came to me because she did n't talk . She was n't drunk . Not that I knew about alcohol then . But she was in control . Cool when we began . Laughing at me for all I did n't know . Crazy as I was after we got going . " We were still at it when my folks got home . They 'd had car trouble and never got to the revival . Day just breaking . I 'd seen the dawn and said we 'd better stop , but Virgie Ellen wanted one more time . My mother heard that creaky bed . They opened the door and caught us at it . " And I felt glad " ? wistfully , he grinned at Megan ? " because I thought we 'd have to marry . That was what I wanted . More than anything . Till I found out what a fool I 'd been . Virgie Ellen got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . She walked out the front door and married Walt Montalbert that afternoon . I sat in the back of the church and bit my lip when my father asked if anybody had a reason why it should n't happen . " He drained his margarita and held up two fingers to order again . " After supper , he called me into his study and tried to scold me . I had fornicated . He wanted me to kneel with him and pray for God 's eternal mercy . I lost my temper enough to call him a hypocrite . He said he had counseled  | and prayed with Virgie and Walt and even Mr. Montalbert . Virgie had confessed her sin and cried about it . He said Christ had forgiven her and Walt had . As He would forgive me . I told him they were all stinking hypocrites . " That night , I thought it over . Lying in that creaky bed that still had the smell of Virgie and our lust . I did n't sleep much , but I saw what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I could take and got out of the house . I never went back or even wrote a letter . " Quizzically , he looked at Megan . " If you want to know , I guess that 's what put me on the road to what you call my profession . In the beginning , I got hurt a lot . Because I was still pretty innocent . Got knocked around . Sometimes hungry . But I joined the army when I could and found I liked it . Learned the game and learned I love it . " Even if you want to call me some kind of rogue . " " Rogue ? " Gravely amused , she paused to consider him . " Your own word . " She nodded , and he saw he had n't lost her . " If it means a solitary fighting male , I suppose it might fit you . " Their table was ready . The chef was French . Megan let Don order for her , though she declined the wine . Eating with relish , she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your turn , " he told her . " Maybe so , if I had anything to tell about . But I do n't . Nothing like your career . " " Anyhow , I 'd like to know . " " Why not ? " A wry little smile flashed and faded . " We were twins , Egan and I. Results of a bad love affair . We never knew our father . Mother was always ill , and she died before we were nine . Uncle Luther took us over . Kind enough but absorbed with business . Egan and I  --  we had very little except each other . He grew up unhappy . His analyst told him we 'd been too close . " Maybe we were , but I did better than Egan . Maybe because Uncle Luther always favored me . I stayed in graduate school when Egan quit . Took degrees in science and worked in research till the lawyers read me the will and I went to work with the foundation . " That , she said , had filled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egan had left her with some unconscious trauma , he wished again for a lot he had lost . Women had always been part of the game he played , prizes or opponents or , often , both . The recollection of Virginia Ellen had sharpened his desire for Megan . Watching her , he thought she might be vulnerable . Recoiling from her image of the killer , she had somehow been caught against her will . Yet longing to be liked  --  to be loved for more than that  --  he decided not to push his luck . He wanted her too much to risk offense , and he thought some better time might come . Anyhow , he could n't afford to throw away an unexpected chance to get back into the game . When they left the Penthouse Club , he let her drive him on to his quarters at the lab . She left him there without explaining anything except to say that most of the staff was out at the launch facility . The long dining room was almost empty next morning , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served him peppery huevos rancheros and told him how to find la doctora 's office . Megan met him warmly but still a little warily . She had him wait at a big table in the conference room while she gathered four men for his interview . Her brief introductions left him bewildered . Martin Rablon , computer expert . Ivan Tomislav , Nobel winner who appeared to need one of his own medical miracles . Capt . Mack Wardian , former astronaut and airline pilot . Galen Ulver , a spry little elf who had tried to build fusion rockets . All cordial enough but also sharply watchful . To judge him . For what ? And what were they to Megan ? All four seemed totally at home with her , and she with them . Rablon had longer hair than Brink liked but was nearest her own age , tall and striking , eagerly attentive to her . Tomislav looked haunted , half ill and a good bit older but craggily handsome and clearly fond of her . Wardian and even old Ulver were brilliant minds in leanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers , she had them . Megan brought coffee , and they sat around the table to interrogate him . About his skill with weapons , his experience in military planning and command . He saw Tomislav 's disapproving frown at some of the causes he had served and Megan 's reservations .  | " I fight for hire . " He let his voice lift . " Or I did when I could fight . For leftists or rightists . For legal rulers or rebels against them . Never found one side much better than the other . Or much worse , for all the slants you see in the media . Men do n't fight because they 're evil or because they are n't . They fight because they 're human . " Feeling reckless , he challenged Megan . " So do women when you know them . Because we 're all human . Doing what we 're born for . Animals if you like , after mates and territory . " He turned to Tomislay . " Or tools of our genes , I imagine you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scowling , Tomislav grunted . " I 'm a weapon . " He had begun to enjoy the confrontation . " No more guilty than a gun . Or innocent . Except that I do have rules of my own , which I 'll make clear if I 'm employed . One of them is loyalty . I 've been a useful weapon to a lot of people over too many years because I 've taught myself how to survive . " And I do n't sell out . " Megan thanked him gravely and asked him to wait outside . Almost at once , she called him back . All four men stood up to shake his hand again . Even Tomislav , looking flushed and unsteady . " You 'll do , " she told him . " For what ? " She let the men take turns with the story . They were preparing to sow mankind across the worlds of other stars . Not with vast spacecraft carrying colonists on flight that must take many generations but with manseed . Tomislav 's word when his turn came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , short of breath ? " scattered toward every promising star within the lightyears , the few light-years we can hope for them to cross . Half machines but half alive . Carrying the human genes ? " His wind had run out , and Wardian spoke . " Our genes and our culture . All coded into computer memories and loaded into synthetic seed , designed to find root and restore the race . To plant a new humanity , designed to be a little better than ourselves , on any world where the craft find friendly soil . " Brink shook his head , more than ever bewildered .  | " That sounds insane . " He frowned again at Megan . " Even if it is n't , what use have you for me ? " " Interstellar space wo n't be friendly . " Wardian again , his clipped accent faintly British , his manner one of half-quizzical yet grave detachment . " Any worlds we reach may be hostile . The fragile seeds must be protected in flight and defended when they land until mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defenders  --  special beings designed to deal with emergency or danger . We want to record some of your special skills for those Defenders . " " Nonsense ? " " Please , Don , " Megan begged . " Just listen . " She looked at Rablon . " If you 're listening , Mr. Brink . " Rablon was too loud and too blunt , hard for him to like . " Essentially , we want you to help educate a computer . The master computer , which each seed will carry . It will be programmed to create Defenders when circumstances require them . " S quatting over the access door , he looked for the nearing star . It was gone , carried out of view by the tumbling of the ship , and he had to rise to find it . His vision turned telescopic when he did , to let him see the dimensionless dots of the four giant planets and the star 's own hot white disk .  | Already looming larger ? He could n't be sure , yet now he could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they were still rushing toward it , still at the top velocity of the long flight out from Earth , hundreds of kilometers a second . With drive power lost . If he could restore it , if the ship could be controlled and slowed , perhaps they could yet be saved . Perhaps they still could find a friendly world ahead , smaller and warmer than those gas giants , a fertile field for the human seed . If he failed , if he let them flash into the star 's vast gravitational vortex with no control , they would surely hit something . Planet or comet or another grain of meteor dust , perhaps the star itself . No matter which , almost any impact would kill the ship forever . Even if by chance they struck nothing , they would emerge on a random course toward nowhere , doomed to endless flight through interstellar emptiness . He stooped again at the access door to pull the damaged board and inspect its close rows of cubes . They seemed perfect , so he let his vision go microscopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found  | the broken circuits then , cut by a hairline crack . With no replacement board , he begged for aid . " Defender to Ship . Damage discovered . How can I repair it ? " Megan 's features shimmered and shattered in his mind again , but the far-off voice he heard held a nasal midwestern echo of Martin Rablon . " Weld the breaks . " " Weld them ? " His dismay came back . " Without tools ? " " You are the tool . " A hint of Tomislav 's Slavic accent . " Adequate capacities are engineered into your genes . " " I do n't remember ? " But suddenly he did . The golden nail of his forefinger flexed and stretched into a needle-narrow tip , and the dark fissure swelled again to his shifting vision . He bent closer to the board . Blazing blue , the microscopic arc stabbed and stabbed again , down across the line of breaks . Metal shone and flowed and cooled . He pushed the board home again . " Megan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ship . Can you retest circuit board ? " " The assembler lab , " Megan was telling him . " Where we collect and organize the input file for the master computers . " He followed her out of the hot sun-blaze into the green metal prefab where two black-bearded technicians stood waiting . He hated their hurried abruptness , hated the thin chemical stink of the lab and all the tedious rites of preparation . Stripped , he lay on cold rubber pads , trying not to mind the icy sensors they stuck to his scalp and his face , even over his eyelids . Around his throat , the things were chokingly tight , set to test for words subvocalized . The glaring light went out when they slid his head into the scanner . He had to lie there , motion forbidden . The needle in his neck stung like a desert scorpion , and he felt strange and ill from its radioactive trickle into his brain . " Relax if you can , " Megan said through the headphones , urgently insistent but cool and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just your space know-how . " " Relax yourself , Wardian . " A man 's voice , nasal , demanding , maybe Rablon 's . " All we do  --  all we can do  --  is  | pick up physical data for computer analysis . Nothing telepathic . Dr. Drake will begin questions to guide your responses while we try to record unconscious indices . A less than perfect method because strong emotion interferes . Sometimes we get more than we want , often less ... " Recalling that , he knew more of what he was . A patchwork creation of advanced computer science and engineered organics , his mind put together from recorded bits of Brink and Rablon , of Ulver and Tomislav and Wardian , perhaps of others , too . Scraps half lost in that imperfect pickup process , worn thinner since by unguessable ages in space , tattered again by the impact of the micrometeor . But he was the Defender . Born from a narrow womb in this emergency to serve and guard the ship . That was all he had been made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling and being picked up when the computers read too much . His human emotion , his bleak and bitter loneliness , the pain of his missing manhood  --  all irrelevant relics of lives forever lost , totally meaningless now . Moving like a machine , he closed the access door . Careful with the trailing cord , he walked back to the useless rocket nozzles and stood staring blankly at them . Slowly , the galaxy wheeled around him , dark dust and dust of dazzling suns . He scarcely sensed them . A dull despair had paralyzed him . What was left that he could do ? The scraps of Brink 's battle sense , of Rablon 's craft with computers and Tomislav 's genetics , Ulver 's rocket knowledge and Wardian 's spacemanship  --  how could anything serve the mission of the ship ? Yet he could n't stop . Brink and Rablon and the others had done their part . It was his turn now . He was the Defender , with a function to perform . A function that needed no emotion and would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he let his adapting vision show the four gas giants . " Wardian ? " He spoke in his mind . " We need your knowhow now . " " Wardian data recalled from memory bank . " An emotionless monotone , Wardian 's only remotely . " What does the ship require ? "  | " We 're approaching target star . We require control programs for deceleration and search for target planet . " " Reaction mass exhausted . " Wardian 's troubled features flickered and faded into giddy blankness . " Deceleration impossible . Search maneuvers impossible . Landing impossible . " " Wardian , listen . " They were the Defender ; their functions did not include defeat . " Suppose we could secure reaction mass , could we then control the ship ? " " Supposition contrary to sensed condition of ship ? " " Never mind the problems . " He overrode the gray computer-voice . " Show us a deceleration program . " " Impossible ? " " We require it . " Eyes fixed on the star , he watched its tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily brighter , spreading apart as his vision adjusted . Saw a sudden bright-green line stabbing ahead of the ship into black space . " Indicating computed minimum-energy approach maneuver . " The soundless voice held neither hope nor fear . " Computed for maximal safe deceleration through gravitational and frictional effects of close planetary passes . " Darting ahead , that bright line bent around the nearest planet , whipped around the star , stabbed back at another planet , grazed the third and then the first again , paused and thrust , paused and thrust , passing always nearer , creeping slowly back at last toward the star . " Maneuver impossible , " the voice insisted , " without reaction mass . " " Then we must find reaction mass . " Trying to call Megan 's name , he saw her wispy image , a blankly staring mask . " What sort of matter do the engine 's require ? " " Fluids . " That momentary mask shivered into darkness , and the quick computer voice lost its last hint of her . " Volatile fluids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What other elements ? " " Light elements preferred , in noncorrosive compounds . " " Give me an inventory of all fluids aboard the ship . " An instant of stillness . " Reaction mass : main tanks zero , auxiliary tanks zero . Gas propellants : nitrogen zero , helium zero . Reserve gases : hydrogen zero , oxygen zero . Hydrocarbons : zero . Corn- ment : all available volatiles exhausted in maneuvers to escape meteor swarm . " " Have we no other fluids ? " " None available as reaction mass . " " We have others ? Not rated available ? " " We have feedstocks . " " Why not available ? " " Our feedstocks are an essential reserve required for the establishment of mankind on our target planet . They must be kept intact for that purpose . " " They wo n't be essential if we never get there . Give me a feedstock inventory . " " Hydrocarbons : one point two metric tons . Acids : point one six metric tons . Bases : point one three metric tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metric tons . " " Do they contain deuterium ? " " Computing trace amounts . " A moment of delay . " Hydrocarbons contain trace amounts adequate to support fusion . " " Then we 'll burn the hydrocarbons ? " " Impossible . Design of tanks and pumps and tubing allows no feedstock transfer into laser injection system . " " Then we 'll change the pumps and tubing . " A flash of Megan 's face , ashen with distress , and that dead computer-voice . " Impossible ? " When he called the Ulver data out of memory , the computer gave him a plan of the ship 's internal plumbing . There was no access door to the pumps and tubing from the feedstock tanks , and he had to slice into the hull to reach them . The hydrocarbons were frozen , exploding into vapor under his cutting arc , but there were circuits from the reactor to thaw tanks and pipes and pumps . He cut the hydrocarbon tubes , spliced them to the laser injectors , reset the valves , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the cut-out slab too small to fit squarely , but he patched it back with waste metal from the discarded tubing . The wrong sort of stuff to endure the searing planetary passes , but he thought the refractory nosecone would get the worst of that . Perhaps his patch would hold . Or perhaps It was not his function to dwell upon what he could not  | control . Winding the throbbing cord on his arm , he climbed the bright hull again , back to the narrow door from which he had been born . Inside again , he tapped the smooth bulge that closed it . Relaxing in the dark , he felt the gentle thrust of the rockets . The Defender 's function had been performed . The engines were alive again , bending the ship 's flight path toward that nearest planet , steering them into the deceleration maneuver that might take them safely at least close to the star , into a region they might search for a world fit for planting man He was happy in his dream because tomorrow would be wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the game . He 'd found Mom baking a snow-white coconut cake , the kind he loved best , and discovered the shiny new trike they had hidden in the hall closet . He would be five .  | He could n't reply . The dream still possessed him , the human Megan still alive in his mind . He wanted her again . The proud spirit and the sleeping passion beneath her cool reserve and all the wonder of her that he had only begun to discover . The magic sweetness of her hair and the taste of her mouth . Her joyous devotion to him  --  but that had been only in the dream . The ache of waking was still too sharp for him to bear . In the dream , he had forgotten what he was . Nothing human , but only a gadget . Half machine and half alive , a creation of computer science and genetic engineering , his mind  --  rather , his own controlling program ? patched from bits of skill and know-how the Defender had been expected to require , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Floating weightless in the dark birthcell , he explored himself again . The cold and hairless flesh , pliantly metallic . The throbbing umbilical , only slightly warmer , coiling out of darkness to his belly . Shivering , yet nerved with sudden hope , he reached to feel his crotch . All he found was stiffly yielding metal , slick and cold and hairless . Nothing had grown while he slept . Still he had no reason to dream of any woman " Defender , alert ! " The computer again , icily unfeeling . " Free oxygen detected on target planet . Interpreted as evidence of life . Our Master Control Program forbids planting on advanced planets . If we find native culture evolved to our own level or above , mission must be aborted . You will survey target planet for indications of advanced intelligence . " " Defender to Ship . " Automatic words , spoken by the machine he was . " I will comply . " Fingers a-tingle as feeling returned , he searched the slick metallic wall of his narrow birthpod , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the bulging opener , he hammered with his fist . Floating , waiting , he groped again for the source of that lost dream . For it felt too real to be a dream , and he thought it might lead him to more of himself . A mongrel half thing , he yearned to be whole , hungered for humanity , longed to recover that lost instant of total happiness . All his human fragments came from troubled men , trapped on a troubled planet , all in love with Megan  --  or at  | least itching for her . The project itself had been her only promise he remembered . A share in her eager hope for a new human start , a better human chance , on whatever worlds the seed might reach . He wanted more . He wanted Megan . Had any of them won her ? Waiting for his dark cell to open , shrinking from the Defender 's hard and bitter lot , he tried to follow the clue of the dream . Sifting again through those fragmentary bits of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment of untroubled love , any real recollection of skiing with Megan at Angel Fire . He found another talk with her . The day in the lab had been too long . Used to action , he had been forced to lie too still in the scanner , too cold and sick from the radioactives filtering into his brain , battered too hard by too many demands for all he knew of combat . " It 's all we offered . " A glint of malice in her tone . " A way for you to fight again . " He hated the way , now that he knew what it was . Though , in fact , his bad knee did n't matter here . All the job took was lying passive while they pounded him with questions to get unconscious reactions Rablon 's computers could record . Too many questions , most of them painful . What conflicts had he seen ? How had he planned for them ? How had he trained ? What forces had he commanded ? Who had commanded him ? What weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What engagements had been decisive ? How had they been won ? How defeated ? How much had he been paid ? How little ? With whose funds ? What laws had he broken ? With what consequences ? Had he ever looted ? Killed civilians ? Worked with terrorists ? With the CIA ? With any other such agency ? He had never liked looking back . There had been more blunders than victories , more pain than elation . Perhaps there were secret selves inside him that he did n't want to meet . The moment had always been enough , and the lure of tomorrow  --  so long as he was fit to face it . Why did men kill ? Why had he enjoyed it ? Megan 's questions , most of them , asked with increasing shock and revulsion . She wanted to despise him . Yet , in  | spite of all her idealism , she had been fascinated by his dedication to that oldest and most absorbing human game , played for life or death . And she had fascinated him , not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath her crisp control . Limping back from the shower after that hard session , he found her waiting for him in the lab . " Buy you a drink ? " He grinned wryly at her . " Something smoother than your radio cocktails . " " My turn . " Her quick smile erased the ache in his knee . " With dinner . After all , it 's Friday night . " She drove him to the Aztecan Temple , a shabby-looking little place off Central where the Mexican food was hot and the margaritas smooth enough . They talked . She asked for more about the elephant poachers he had fought in Africa and the Izquierdista rebellion . He relished her unwilling admiration . Nerved with the drinks and her clean loveliness , he begged her to come with him back to Mexico . " I 'll rent a plane  --  the knee 's well enough for that  --  and fly you down to Baja . " He saw her start , eyes almost frightened . " Most of the crew will take the weekend off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning . " " Don ? " Her breath had caught . For a long moment , she looked at him across her salted glass , a flush of tangled feelings on her face . For a moment , she was about to yield , but then he saw her ripe lips tighten , perhaps with pity for him . " Not that I 've a lot left for anybody , " he muttered . " And no harm intended . But  --  if I could love  --  I love you , Megan . " " I 'm sorry , Don . " Her fine head shook sharply , and she leaned across the table , eyes very grave . " Terribly sorry . Because I  --  I like you , Don . " " You forgive the killing ? " " Maybe ? " She flinched as if to a stab of pain . " Maybe that 's why I like you . But ? " Her eyes fell for an instant , then rose to meet his . " I 'm a virgin , Don . Egan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink , but I never did . Seldom ever thought about it since the seedship project started . I 've wondered if it somehow takes the place of sex . " When it 's finished ? " She drew a long breath , and her hand reached for his . " Maybe ? "  | The long slit was widening . He saw the glint of stars outside , swept past by the ship 's slow spin , but still she haunted him . Still he longed to know who  --  which part of him  --  could have been with her at Angel Fire . Not Don Brink . Even if she kept that uncertain promise in time for the event to get into the ship 's computer , Brink could n't have been the skier . Not with the mortar splinter in his knee . Who else ? Shadowy jealousies woke to spur him . If Megan had really been a virgin , all five men wanting her , who had been lucky ? Watching the creeping stars , he sifted again through those scrambled scraps of memory . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest quite so vivid as Brink 's . Martin Rablon ? The computer engineer , maybe hoping for Megan to replace his wife  --  though the glimpses of his faithless Jayna revealed little likeness . No idealist , born poor but bright , she had been plain Jane Brown when he met her . His student in beginning computer science , failing till she began to pay for her grades with what she did best . Torn between his science and his business interests and her witchery , Rablon had no time for sports ; he had probably never learned to ski . Ivan Tomislav , the genetics engineer ? Searching through random scraps of Tomislav , he found skis and poles and boots , but they lay gathering dust in a bedroom closet at the La Jolla bungalow . Tomislav was aging , overweight , and on a diet . The gear had belonged to his dead son A burst of painful memory . Roger dead and Olga dying . Poor dear Olga , once fatter than he , skeletal and bedfast now , begging for the shots he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had driven Roger to suicide when it was diagnosed in him . Olga dying because his genetic science had been too slow with the synthetic virus that might have repaired those fatal genes . For an instant , he was Tomislav , puffing off the plane at Albuquerque , a little troubled by the altitude and more by Olga 's illness . Megan 's voice calling his name and his wistful admiration when he saw her . As straight and strong as Olga had been when they met at Union . If he had only found the right research track ten years before ?  | But genetic clocks did n't turn back , and the happy skier at Angel Fire had not been Tomislay . Wardian , the airline pilot and exastronaut ? More likely . Young enough , well tanned and muscular , as tall as NASA allowed , he had an easy way with women . Angel Fire ? He had known it most of his life . There with his dad when he was a kid . Later with Debbie , teaching her to ski while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge at the lab , drinking canned Coors while they waited for Ivan and his crew to run down a bug in the scanner . " Megan ? " Wardian gave Brink a startled grin . " Not for me . Though she is a stunner . Could be , anyhow , if she ever lets anybody turn her on . " " I ca n't help dreaming . . . " He shook his head and eased the aching knee . " Your lay . " Wardian lifted his beer with a half-ironic flourish . " If she ever lets you make her , which I do n't expect . As for me , I like to look , but I 've got two rules for women . Never let ' em marry you . And never touch a virgin . " If Wardian had kept that second rule , if Galen Ulver had been too old and frail for Angel Fire The slit had widened , and the ship 's slow tumble let a sun-blade slash across him . No clue found , he gave up the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really been a dream . He would probably never know . Not that it could matter now , because all those unlucky men were long gone to dust , their world forever lost . Shivering a little in the cold birthcell , he tried to brush their haunting ghosts away . He was all of them , none of them , more than any of them . Their wispy relics were random defects in the Defender of the ship , hazards to his duty now .  | The opening door looked wide enough at last . Coiling the warm umbilical on his arm to keep it free , he squeezed his way outside . S lack space and blazing metal . He was blind for an instant , until his eyes adjusted to the savage sun . Magnetic feet clinging to the metal , he stood up to orient himself . The ship was still beneath him , alive again , still slowly tumbling , its gold-filmed skin crudely patched where he had tapped into the hydrocarbon feedstocks , his slender yellow life-cord still trailing back through the slit behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted him . Here at last , their long-lost goal ! The new world where the seed of man might put out fresh roots and thrive again  --  if they got it safely planted . Close below and more than half in shadow , the planet was a magnificent crescent , huge even before his eyes went telescopic . Dazzling clouds wound the equator in a snaky line that would be the zone of tropical convergence . Blueblack ocean reached north and south from that to meet white-swirling storms . He saw no land . " Ship to Defender . " The master computer . " Requesting data as you observe it . " " Observation in progress . " Trying to forget Megan 's haunting overtones in the quick synthetic voice , he heard his own soundless reply , itself no more human . " Patterns of cloud reveal systems of air circulation which resemble Earth 's , indicating strong Coriolis effect due to planet 's rotation . Climatic environment should favor human survival if we can land . "  | " We continue to monitor entire radiation spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of life except atmospheric oxygen . You will search for possible touchdown site . " " I am searching . " He watched the planet 's slow rotation as they spun on around it . The bright crescent spread . New storm patterns crept over the limb . Dark sea and shining cloud . He found no solid surface " Nobody knows . " In Megan 's office at the lab , Wardian leaned to frown at the big device he called a stellarium . Just installed , it still had a hot-plastic scent . The stars were tiny lights on thin rods radiating from the brighter central light that stood for the sun . A lucite sheet through the sun marked what he called the galactic plane . Two half hoops swung around it to show galactic longitude and latitude , and the monitor on Megan 's desk displayed data on any star beneath their point of intersection . Never data enough . " Of course , we hope for planets . " Wardian shrugged . Just in from hang gliding off the Manzano slopes , he looked lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too certain of what he could do , a little too ironic about everything else . What did Megan think of him ? " Theory says planets should exist . " Wardian spoke only half to him , fine eyes still fixed on her . " Planets enough like Earth to give the seed a chance , perhaps around every normal star . We do have uncertain evidence of a few gas giants , but our instruments are n't good enough to show the worlds we 're looking for . " " We 're shooting at planets we ca n't even see ? " Brink shook his head at Megan . " What sort of chance ? " " Please , Don . " Chiding him , Megan seemed almost hurt . " We 've got good things going for us . " Pity for her stabbed through his half-unwilling worship . Standing tall beside that glittering gadget , she was framed against the window , her lean vitality in bright contrast to the desert vista beyond . Bold enough to challenge mankind 's mortality . Lovely enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too idealistic . Squandering herself on  | the project , her life a needless sacrifice to a goal most of the world would laugh at . " The odds are terrible . " She nodded soberly . " Against any single seed . But we 're going to scatter them by the hundreds  --  thousands if we can  --  across a whole field of stars . " " If the authorities ever let Galen test his fusion drive . " Wardian grinned wryly at her optimism . " If he can make it work when they do and build the units cheap enough . If we have time to launch the ships before our own world blows up . " " Problems . " She shrugged . " We 'll get them solved . " Her greenish eyes came back to him , turning graver . " You 're another problem , Don . " " You want me to fight for planets if we find them ? " " The problem is that you might do that a little too well . " Wardian looked quizzical . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your genes would turn the children of the ships into interstellar vandals , ravaging the galaxy . Which is n't what we want . " He looked at Megan . " We need you , Don , " she assured him . " Some of you , anyhow . The question is how much . I know how you love your old game of war , but modern weapons have made it suicidal . The new races have to be designed not to kill each other . " " If you make them pacificists , " he said , " they wo n't last long . " " A thorny question . " A needle of fear stabbed through him , fear that he would n't be wanted . " We 're still looking for the answer . " She found him in the lounge at the lab , one morning not much later . Frowning at the program board , he was looking for his name . Again it was n't there . Depressed about it , he turned to meet her . " Through with me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure . " I hope not . " " I 've been waiting three days now . " Waiting for another session in the scanner . He felt baffled and bored . Still too lame for much activity , he had tried to read the tattered magazines on the rack , dry technical journals on computers and astronautics and genetics . Tried to read a paperback novel , a war story written by a  | romantic fool who had never been in combat . Tried to plan what to do next if Megan let him go . " Let 's talk to Ben , " she was saying . " We took the problem to him . " " Ben ? " " Ben Bannerjee . " He heard a special softness in her voice . " You have n't met him because he 's too frail for the scanner . But he 's the brain of Raven Foundation . " He followed her out of the lounge . " Ben knows you , " she said . " From editing your scanner pickups . Converted into audio , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you because you 've done so much that he could only dream about . You 'll admire him , Don , if you 'll give yourself a chance . " He heard the admiration in her own voice . " It 's Benjamin Franklin Bannerjee . " They were crossing the parking lot toward a building where Omega had fabricated weapon components . " A name he picked for himself because he never knew his parents . Born deformed , somewhere in India . He does n't know the place or even his age . Maybe five or six years old when my uncle found him on a Calcutta street . In the hands of a one-eyed Fagin type who had him squatting there in rags and filth , playing chess against anybody . " Winning every game . " My uncle had never married . Or cared much for children , not even Egan and me . But he was taken with Ben from that first glimpse . Bought him from the thug who claimed him . Got him back to New York for medical care  --  nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Don . " She stopped on the walk outside the building . " That 's why I 'm warning you . He does turn people off . His brains , I guess , as much as his looks . But I 've known him since I was seven . And loved him as much as Uncle Luther did . So did Egan . Toward the end , I think he was Egan 's only friend . " Uncle Luther always trusted him . For business advice and finally about the seedship . Egan 's idea , but Uncle Luther never listened to Egan . Ben saw how to make it real . Without him , we would n't be here . " He followed her inside . A white-starched nurse made  | them put on surgical masks and wash their hands at a surgical sink before she let them into a windowless room in which the overheated air had a thin , antiseptic bite . He heard a queer screechy quavering and tried not to recoil when he saw Ben . A child-sized thing in an odd-looking wheelchair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its face narrow and dark and shapeless , a mask of long suffering , twitching strangely . The body too small for the head , grotesquely crumpled . The nurse spoke , and the quavering changed . The powered chair spun toward him . He saw a single fleshless arm , the only useful limb . Dark , pain-haunted eyes peered up at him . Uneasy before them , he looked back at Megan . " Ben ? " Her easy warmth seemed strange in the lab-like room . " Here 's Don . " " Hi , Mr. Brink . " That gnarled mask had tried to smile , and Ben 's single spidery claw scuttled across a computer keypad . Croaking from a speaker on the stark white wall , the words set a shiver in him . " Thanks for coming in . Miss Zorrilla will find you a seat . " The nurse brought a seat , and he sat uneasily before those disconcerting eyes , expecting to be grilled again about his life and his hopes and his ethics . Megan came to stand behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tender smile behind her own white mask . " Mr. Brink , I believe you play chess . " " Not often . " " Neither do I. " The dreadful face seemed to grin . " Too many urgencies interfere . Have you time for a game ? " " Time 's all I have . " Miss Zorrilla brought a board . Ben announced a twominute limit , but that agile claw needed only seconds for a move . Though Brink tried to play a cautious game , in twenty moves he was beaten . " Good game , Don . " Those queerly brilliant eyes stabbed at him again . " I was asked for advice about you . I think we do need you in the Defender . " " Thanks ? " The word came out with more emotion than he wanted . " Thanks ! " " I 'm glad , " Megan whispered .  | " I 've talked to Marty and Ivan . " Ben looked up at her , yellow fingers poised , that tragic mask transformed with love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise . " The fingers were flashing again . " The ships may need defense . The new colonies may till they can care for themselves . But we are n't launching conquistadores . " The haunted eyes came from Megan back to him . " Marty 's writing a new control program for the computers . A triple test , to protect any inhabited worlds the ships may reach . The first is technological , to turn them away from any planet that shows evidence of electronic communication or nuclear energy or space navigation . The second is economic and political , to protect any global social system . The third is cultural . It goes somewhat farther , intended to prevent the murder of any intelligent race or evolving culture . The program will kill the seed , even after landing , if any creatures simply say they do n't want us there . " " You mean we ca n't fight  --  anything ? " " Our decision . " Ben 's skeletal head nodded unsteadily . " If you are challenged by anything intelligent , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That took his breath . " Ca n't you recon-sider ? " " We did reconsider . " The wheelchair was rolling away , and again the overhot room was filled with the audio chirps and squeaks and drones of the scanner recording . That electronic voice rang through it , inhumanly remote . " We 've made the rules , Mr. Brink . The game 's yours to play . We expect you to play it well ? " " But ? " " Thanks , Mr. Brink . Thanks for coming in . " The nurse waved them toward the door . " Better than nothing , I guess . " Unhappily , he followed Megan out . " But still a deadly handicap . If you build a suicide drive into the ships , what sort of chance is left ? " " Chance enough . " She paused to take off the mask , looking back toward Ben with what he thought was wistful sadness . " We are n't setting out to conquer the stars . Just to keep mankind alive . If just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all we need  --  and maybe more than we 've earned , if you look at human history . " " I ca n't guess what enemies we 'll meet ? " " But I 've begun to know you , Don . " She gave him an odd half smile . " I think you can cope with any handicap ? " Land ! A broken coast beneath the belted clouds , creeping over the world 's bright curve . Brighter than the sea and softly tinged with green  --  which must mean chlorophyl or something very like it . Trembling , he watched its slow roll toward him . A bright line shone along the horizon . He watched it climb , widen , become an enormous mountain mass that towered out of the clouds . A dead volcano , dominating the continent  --  in some remote tectonic past , it must have built the continent . His eyes went telescopic to study the icy dazzle of its vast caldera and the glaciers on its snowy slopes . " Defender , " the computer was demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could ask for . A land mass that reaches from the tropics nearly to the northward pole . Somewhere on it , we should find everything we need . If the program allows us to land ? " " Ship to Defender . We report all monitors recording . No negative input received . You will continue scanning for possible touchdown points . " Walking around the tumbling hull to follow the planet , he found the umbilical coiling to snare his knees . He pivoted back to free it . Shuffling again to watch the rolling world below , he found a second continent . Not quite so large , it stretched from the equatorial clouds far toward the other pole . Not quite so high , it carried no visible ice . Drier , a vast waste of red-brown desert below the belt of storms . Older , perhaps , built by an earlier tectonic spasm and now worn low . Scattered between the two continents , he found new patches of broken cloud . Formed , he thought , where trade winds were lifted by island chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his meteorology ? Wardian , maybe . Pilots had to know weather ?  | " Defender , we request data for possible landing . " " The northern continent looked more likely . It should have a wider climatic range . Perhaps richer resources . But we 'll need a long study of it before we can select any touchdown ? " " Defender ! " Still emotionless , the computer voice had changed . It spoke faster , with stronger hints of Megan . He caught another fleeting image of her face , turned rigid now and wan , eyes fixed and empty . " Monitors detect radiation . We are under scan by widespectrum beams . " " Where ? " He turned from the planet to search the space around them . The hot sun-disk , a little smaller and a little bluer , he thought , than the lost sun of Earth . Two of the sun 's huge gas planets , darting into view as his vision adapted . Nothing else . Not even a moon . " Source not identified ? " The computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Alien spacecraft following on our own orbit , close behind and closing . " Still he saw nothing . " Can we signal ? " " We are transmitting initial contact code on every frequency available . Our signals are ignored . " " If we 're attacked , can we fight ? " " Negative . We are unarmed . Control program forbids armed combat with anybody . " " Then we 'd better dodge ? " " Defender , attention ! We detect missile approaching . " " Take evasive action ? " " Evasion impossible . Our rockets lack adequate ac-celeration ? " Something hit him . Struck his chest and knocked him off the hull . Whirling into space , fumbling for anything , he found it anchored to his flesh . A heavy metal disk that felt slightly warm . He clawed to tear it off , but still it clung fast . The ship spun away from him , a bright golden toy , still linked by his trailing umbilical . The alien craft went by . A flash of bright metal and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable , per- haps , to the disk on his chest ? Groping , he found no cable . Spinning , helpless , he felt the umbilical tighten . " Ship ! " He tried to call . " Defender to Ship ? " Agony dazed him , and his voice was dead . The hot sun dimmed . He lost the alien craft . Feebly , he slapped at his belly . The umbilical was gone , torn away , his life itself cut off . " Ship ! " He tried again . " Calling Ship ? " Megan 's white ghost-face flickered in his mind , fixed and stricken . Spinning into space , he got one glimpse of the tiny golden seedcraft . Dull now , as his vision went out . Already tiny with distance and gone in an instant . " Ship to Defender . " The voice was almost Megan 's , burdened with a bleak despair no computer could express , swiftly fading . " We report end of mission . In response to display of advanced technology , our master control program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give up " Ship to Defender . " A soundless murmur , dying . " We must obey . You will not attempt to damage alien craft or its masters ? " " But  --  somehow  --  ca n't we ? " His own voice had failed . Pain throbbed under the clutching hand on his belly , slowly easing . Dully searching , he failed to find the alien machine . The sun went out , and he slid into darkness .  | Still groggy from shock and the pain in his belly , he fought for awareness and found the thing against the stars ahead . A space toy at first , flying farther ahead as the missile hauled him toward it . In a moment , his perceptions shifted , to let it loom awesome and enormous . Spacecraft or station , it made the seedship an inconsequential gnat . Never meant for atmospheric flight , its fantastic masses were not streamlined anywhere . Half black shadow , they burned where the sun struck , darkly rustred . Groping dimly to know what it was , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow down the middle of it . Brighter , perhaps , because its walls had been a shield against radiation damage . Inky shadow filled two others that lay parallel . All were trimly tapered , as if to fit streamlined machines . One of them his attacker ? Probably not ; in his fleeting glimpse of that , it had seemed far smaller . No matter . The thing 's very presense in orbit was enough to forbid the planet to them . With no fuel left to lift them toward another target , everything was over . Ben Bannerjee 's decision , and he knew he must accept it . After all , most of the seedcraft had been expected to die . A single cog in one machine , he should n't be upset about it . He had been engineered to obey the Master Program , not to feel emotion .  | But In spite of himself , in spite of the program and his own gray despair , he found both golden hands grasping and wrenching at the missile on his chest . A thick metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him toward that monstrous starcraft . Numb and clumsy , his fingers slipped off the clinging thing . He tried again , weaker still , and found awareness washing out . A little energy , he thought , had somehow come from the sunlight , but too little to replace the umbilical . His feeble struggle had drained too much . Cursing silently , in a bitter fit of unengineered and useless human rage , he felt darkness strike . A dazing blow . Dimly , he knew he must have been hauled into the shadow of that great space-thing , but all he knew was the pain from his belly He ran to hide in the closet . They would n't find him there because Sharon would want to look outside , in the shed or maybe behind the hedge . If anybody found him , he hoped it would be Penny . She had a nice smell , and she would scream and be glad . He liked Penny . It was dark in the closet when he pulled the door shut . Something silky hung against his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothballs and old perfume . His heart was thumping hard . He leaned against the door , listening . Nothing . He waited . The house stayed very quiet , and he knew they were looking outside . The silky thing tickled his face . When he tried to push it away , it fell down over his head . The old perfume was too strong in it , and he could n't breathe . Gasping , he fought it off . He heard them coming , their feet light and quick in the hall , which had no carpet . The door rattled . He heard Penny whisper , but she did n't open the door and scream . Something clicked , and they went away . He waited , but they never came back . He hated the dark . The silky thing came down in his face again . The closet was too hot , and he could n't stand the mothball smell . It was time to come out . He pushed at the door . It would n't open . He knew then that Penny had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pounded on it with both fists and yelled for Sharon to let him out , but nobody  | came . It was n't fair . They were cruel , but he could n't fight them . Not even after he got out . Because they were girls . His tummy felt bad , and still the door would n't open . He yelled till he could n't breathe , but nobody came . Nobody was fair . He lay on the Floor . It rocked under him , and the dust made him sneeze He woke in the dark , still on the floor . Something heavy had fallen on his chest , and he felt too weak to throw it off . Still he could n't breathe , and the silent dark was suffocating . He tried to yell again . He could n't yell because he had no voice . He could n't see any walls , but he knew the place was bigger than the closet . A lot bigger . He was n't breathing , but now he did n't need to breathe . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idiotic command and that strange space machine . Dimly , he wondered if he had been hauled somewhere inside it , but his belly still ached , and his brain would n't work . Without the umbilical or even the feeble energy he had somehow drawn from sunlight , he was powerless , dying . And something  --  something was coming . It crept at him silently out of the dark . At first , only a dark shadow-mass , but then he began to make out its shape . Something not much larger than he was , crawling on its belly . It moved like a cockroach , crawling and stopping , darting and stopping to watch him again . It had no legs . No eyes that he could see . No jaws or insect antennae or anything else that he knew . It was low and wide and flat , with no projections anywhere , though it carried something on its back . Something disk shaped , flat as it was . The disk was shining . Dim at first , it grew abruptly brighter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The floor was circular and huge , a good hundred meters across . The ceiling was nearly too high to see , but he found a bundle of thick cylinders like the trunks of close-spaced trees climbing toward it from the center of the floor . Everything was metal , dark as if with time , and he knew he must be inside that immense space machine . The moving thing was metal , too , but gold colored , like the gold-filmed seedship and his own body . Darting and  | stopping , darting and stopping , it approached from the direction of the clustered tubes . His head hurt when he tried to understand it , but he knew it meant nothing good for him . He wanted to fight the thing , but when he began groping for any weapon or possible strategy , he saw a wispy ghost of Megan 's stricken face and heard a faint and soundless whisper . Radio , from the seedship ? Or the voice of his own internal computer ? Wondering , he knew no way to tell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input reveals positive evidence of high technology on target planet . Control commands therefore forbid attempt to seed it . Repeat . Master Program to Defender . Mission is canceled . Beings of target planet are not to be attacked , on the surface or in space . " Despair crushed him , cruel as the weight on his chest . The rule was foolish . Even his name was if the program did n't allow him to defend the ship . Evolution had ordained the only real law , that every living thing must fight for the survival of itself and its kind . But he was not alive , not really , and Bannerjee 's crazy edict was built into him . It had to be obeyed . Yet he did n't want to die . Perhaps the rule had limits . He was n't forbidden to escape from danger  --  if he could . Spurred by a surge of human desperation , he fought again at the thing on his chest . Again he found too little strength to remove it . The flat yellow bug-shape had darted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thing it carried tipped on edge and swung one round face toward him , beaming brighter . Gratefully , he drank the radiation in . More than merely light , it warmed him , woke him wider , made him stronger . Again he tugged and thrust . Still the disk held him flat , but not with gravity . His head and his struggling limbs had no weight . They were still in orbit , and the force was something strange to him  --  not magnetic , certainly , because he had a sense for magnetism . He felt the disk-thing scanning him . A whole spectrum of probing radiation . Infrared , furnace-hot . Ultraviolet . Radar . Even gamma rays . Never meant to help him but still what he was starving for . Alive again with that new energy , he braced himself to cope .  | What could the bug want from him ? If it was a defender of the planet , stationed here in orbit to challenge space invaders , it must have taken the seedship for an enemy . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he could somehow explain the ship , perhaps it could yet be saved . Those two great continents had looked empty enough , even to his telescopic vision . No visible cities , no patterns of roadways or farmland , no industrial smog , no hint of high technology . Somewhere , if only on an island , there might be room for the human seed to grow . After all , his captors had clearly wanted him alive . If he could begin some intellectual contact , they might be persuaded to tolerate a small colony . The best of Earth 's life and mind had come stored in the ship 's computers . In due time , if the seed found root , such treasures might be bartered for added living space . Even , perhaps , for new science and culture . He twisted himself to wave one hand , wondering if the bug would understand any gesture . As if in answer , the disk tipped farther toward him , its radiation changing to a quick-shifting pulse . He felt it throbbing out the seedship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship had sent it . Intelligence ! Quivering with elation , he listened to the soundless signal . A beep and a pause . Four beeps and a pause . Nine , sixteen , twenty-five , until his count of squares was 256 . Then an empty box , sixteen pixels to the side . Simple patterns flashed inside it : triangle , square , trapezoid , a ragged circle . A bigger box , flickering with new detail . The signal came faster , faster , till he could make the pictures move . The star , a brighter dot against the strange constellations he had seen . Its whole planetary system swelling away . The four gas giants with all their moons in orbit . This inner planet , moonless , tiny at first but growing to fill the frame . The ship 's outline . His own picture , complete with the linking umbilical . Perhaps Tomislav lay naked again with his head in the scanner , enduring the cold sensors on his eyes and his throat , feeling faint from the stuff in his brain and trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickups , but so did sweat ; Rablon said they had to keep him cold . Waiting for Megan 's voice in the headphones , he could n't help a pang of guilt about his lust for her or escape a secret shame being so jealous about the way she smiled at Wardian and Rablon and even poor old Brink . He had been celibate too long . While Olga died . Back in La Jolla , yearning for him , grieving for all they had lost . Creaking feebly every morning when he called in that dreadful mockery of the singing voice he had loved so long , bravely saying she could wait for him to finish if he was really shaping seed to spread mankind across the stars . He knew how much she needed him . He had promised to be there when she died . But he had promised his mind to Megan , promised all that Bannerjee required . He hated the chill and the stink and the sting of the needle and lying still so long , but the project did mean more than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeded with a better human breed The headphones began to click and squeak and howl , but not with any human voice . Images flickered in his head . Nothing he knew , they were stranger than Chinese ideograms or the structure of an unknown gene . Flashing , fading , they ran faster , faster , until he began to see pictures mingled with them . Symbols from math and chemistry , genetic structures that he knew , scrambled words . English . Greek and Latin roots , scientific German . The squeaks and howls became a clanging jangle , at last a voice . " Attack Command to Unidentified . " Loud and slow , cold as sledges on an anvil .

For the encounter had been no meeting of civilized minds , but rather a trial for his life on charges never stated .

He had failed to identify himself as a creation of the Master Builders , whatever they were . Attack Command had not invited him , and it did n't want him here . Backing abruptly toward the clustered columns from which it must have come , the bug stopped again . The disk tipped to focus all its radiation on him . Savagely , it blazed .

Relaxing , eyes staring blankly , he felt the bug coming nearer , felt a final radiation burst . When that ceased , he snatched at the heavy metal oval that held him down . It clung fast . With both hands , he twisted , thrust , strained again . He felt vibration , felt the object heat and crack , saw smoke exploding .  | And it was dead . Free , he surged upright . Once more magnetic , his feet gripped the deck . Clutching the hot metal mass for a weapon of his own , he swung to hurl it at the bug . Something froze him . " Master Program to Defender . " The computer voice , faintly and forlornly also Megan 's . " Repeat , mission canceled . Advanced inhabitants are not to be attacked . " The bug lay motionless , the disk now dim , but he sensed an alert hostility . Scanning his brain  --  or his own internal computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still it meant to kill him . Knowing now that he was immune to radiation , it would look for something deadlier . Trembling , he swung his missile higher . Why should he obey that insane injunction not to fight ? With the ship and the mission in danger , he was the Defender . Trapped here , the umbilical broken , he was on his own . Surely , he would be allowed to defend himself " Master Program to Defender . " A fleeting image of Megan 's saddened face . " Repeat . Control command forbids approach to planet or hostile action against its beings . " The silent voice must be his own internal computer speaking ; the ship 's radio could n't reach him here inside these metal walls . " You will not attack . " He flinched from the mocking hints of Megan because he knew they were only accidental artifacts picked up by that imperfect scanner so long ago , on an Earth forever lost . Chance malfunctions now , hazards to his duty . Defeated , he tossed his useless weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the craft had ever held an atmosphere , that must have leaked away long ago . Rebounding silently , the thing sailed weightlessly away . The bug darted farther back from him . The disk shone brighter for a moment , tipping to trace the thing he had thrown , then went out . Blind in the sudden dark , he sprang aside and stood crouched and wary , waiting for the bug . Surely , his computer would let him guard himself . His feet caught a faint vibration , perhaps when the dead missile struck the wall , but there was no attack . Slowly , his eyes adjusted to the gloom . He saw his own limbs glowing , deeply and eerily red , saw light on a tiny  | patch of floor around him . Puzzled for an instant , he knew it must be infrared . Still hot from that blazing assault , his body was radiating energy his adapting vision could now detect . When it cooled , he would be blind again . Disabled , too , when his chance recharge was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't find the bug . Had it fled , perhaps to find a better weapon ? Or was it lurking somewhere near , watching , waiting till he ran down again ? He had no way to know . He felt driven to action , to use his dwindling store of strength and time  --  but what was there to do ? Standing trapped in the overwhelming dark around his narrow crimson cave , he was ignorant , unarmed , forbidden to fight Trembling , he knotted his fists . " Defender to Master Program . " Defiantly , he addressed his own computer . " At least I can move . I can try to learn where I am and what has captured me . So long as I do n't try to harm anything . " " Master Program to Defender . " He hated that quick inflexible voice , even knowing it came from somewhere in himself . Hated the meaningless echo of Megan . " Repeating control command . You will not attack . You will not resist . You will not interfere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptyhanded , watching for the bug , he struck out to find those clustered pillars . They loomed suddenly into his dim glow , not a dozen meters ahead . Most of them featureless pillars of some dull metal , but he found an oval door in the thickest , a vertical shaft inside . Wide enough for the bug , it yawned black . He clutched the rim and thrust himself through to light it . A circular pit , not two meters across . Darkness filled it , above and below his faint glow . He hung there a moment , wary of the bug , but he saw no movement , felt no vibration . Kicking off , he launched himself upward . Smooth metal walls flowed down around him . Another dark doorway . He caught the rim , pulled himself through . All he found was another vast and empty floor , stretching into soundless dark . Back in the pit , he pushed farther on . A circle of pale light grew ahead until at last he came out into a cavernous space that extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shone dimly blue .  | Immense machines , all half transparent . Visible not with his faint glow but somehow with their dim shine . In a moment , he understood . What he saw was gamma rays . The shapes were nuclear reactors , shining from old contamination . And lofty racks of fuel for them , burning dimly through massive shielding with the faint blaze of atomic decay . Black shadows beyond were enormous tanks that must have held mass for ionic engines . He clung there , dazed . He had known the thing had to be an orbital spacecraft . Fission engines , these were still enough like the seedship 's fusion engines to let him guess their function . And to tell him that the craft had been built for interstellar flight . To other stars ? Or had space invaders flown it here ? From the unknown world of the Master Builders ? Under Attack Command ? Could it have been a bigger sort of seedship ? Sent to plant its makers here ? Shivering , he tried to imagine what kind of creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing except the dancing atoms , and even their radiance was faint . These mighty engines had been cooling for ages he could only guess , certainly many thousand years . The invaders  --  if the great craft had really brought invasion  --  could be rulers of the planet now . He dropped back into the pit , and his orientation spun . The engine room became the bottom of it . Giddy from the shift , he kicked off into the dark . Already his body-glow was fading , the darkness closing in , and he caromed clumsily off the dim wall . His mind was dimming , too . A dark doorway slid into view , strange until he remembered that empty space and the one above it where he had first found himself . Cargo holds , he told himself , if this was a ship . Groggily , he wondered what they had carried . Weapons , perhaps , for the conquest of the planet ? Colonists to claim it ? Tools to terraform it ? Machines , supplies , libraries  --  everything to plant some alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to plant humanity ? Perhaps . He saw no way to tell . His imagination began piling up nightmare things crouching beyond his dying body-glow . Shivering , he shrank back into the shaft and climbed until he saw light again .  | Light stronger than his own . He gripped the rim of the door through which it came and lurched out of the shaft into another immense compartment , dimly lit from six high openings spaced around it . The central tube , with its cluster of surrounding columns , towered behind him into the dark . Swaying unsteadily , the pull of his feet growing weaker , he stumbled across another vast floor and into the brightest opening . A metal tunnel , many meters long , it brought him into increasing light and at last outside the craft , to a dazzling view of open space and the sun . He clung to the lip , drinking in hot energy . The tunnel opened into the bottom of a long metal canyon  --  one of the hollows he had seen from space . Berths for smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Landing craft , perhaps , brought to take the invaders down to the planet ? The canyon walls had once been bright , he thought , but they were scarred and stained red from long exposure to micrometeors and the solar wind . Above him and below were massive fittings that must have secured the landers . If that was what they had been . Looking for some more-certain evidence , he pulled himself back into the tunnel . The strong sunlight was food he hungered for , but he had no time now to let it feed him . Not until he could learn more and feel safer from the bug . One by one , he followed the other tunnels . The next brought him back into life-renewing sunlight . Two opened on inky midnight and the Milky Way . The last let him see the planet 's blazing crescent . Too sad to move , he let his eyes linger on it . His vision adapted to let him see wreathing spirals of cloud and a greenish hint of land . With better luck , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man had come too late . If their little ship had not been hit by that micrometeor , if they had arrived ahead of the invasion He pulled himself away , sick with defeat and his own predicament . The Defender had not been engineered for vain despair , but not for fighting , either . Even if they had landed first , he might still have been forbidden to battle the  | invaders . Certainly , the new human colony would have been ill prepared to meet attack from space . Hating that bleak mood , he tried to shake it off . The Defender had been designed for action ; emotion only got in the way . Even with any helpful action banned , he felt driven to move on . Clumsily reeling , he stumbled back into the central shaft , kicked himself upward . Dull metal slid by him , and two black doorways . Another circle of light appeared and grew ahead . He emerged at last on another deck . Immense and circular , it reached beyond the range of his dim body-glow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the shaft , he thought , should be the control room . Looking for evidence of that , for astrogation gear or traces of the vanished crew , he found scores of dark metal masses standing motionless in rows along six narrow avenues running back into the gloom from a small clear space around the pit . Odd-shaped objects taller than he was . Machines , perhaps , eternal as the seedship , designed maybe by the Master Builders on whatever far-off world they had ruled ? designed to operate the craft for Attack Command ? Carefully , making the most of his dwindling energy , he shuffled to inspect them . Light flashed behind him . Spinning to face it , he met the bug .  | ost of those looming , boxlike masses were timetarnished metal , nearly black , but one was warm enough to glow like Defender 's own body , dully infrared . Taller than the rest , it stood far off , at the end of a shadowy alley . If the others were a robot crew , shut down now , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . The bug had come from somewhere behind it . Gliding silently and fast , the thing stopped in the middle of that gloomy avenue , twenty meters away . His own heat-energy had cooled too long . Swinging groggily to meet the bug , he found himself floating off the deck and had to make a desperate stab with one magnetic toe to get back . Unarmed and bewildered , too far gone even to plan any action , he could only hang there , waiting . The bug lay still , the disk on its golden carapace turning slowly bright enough to show the wall of a thick-ribbed dome that curved up beyond the red-glowing block . The great craft 's nose arched high above him . Scanning it for any weapon the Master Program might let him use , for any hopeful chance , he found only ancient metal . He saw the disk tipping toward him . The light of it focused to fix him with an unsteady beam . He yearned for another burst of its restoring radiation , but the swift-pulsed flicker stayed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A soundless howl . A harsh , inhuman voice . " Attack Command to Unidentified . " " Guest ? " he tried to say . " Guest to Attack ? " " Attention , Unidentified . You establish no authority for  | existence here . Attack Command requires your removal ? " " Removal not required ! " Trying to shout , he saw no hint that the bug received anything . It lay inert , looking as lifeless as a metal ingot . The flickering signal had ceased , but the gray-glowing face of the disk was still fixed upon him like a solitary eye , alertly hostile . " Guest to Attack Command . " He tried again . " We do not resist . Our own commands protect you . All we seek is to survive ? " He saw the second bug . Darting from somewhere about that red-glowing tower , it stopped close behind the first . They looked almost identical , featureless , flat masses , but the second carried something else on its sleek yellow shell . Something cylindrical , pointing at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fading senses to study it . A dark hollow tube . A missile launcher  --  with a dark projectile already emerging ! Desperately , he accelerated . Swaying aside , he reached fast enough but very gingerly to grasp it , let the momentum of its heavy little mass spin his body until its direction was reversed . " Master Program to Defender ! " The warning rang in his dimming mind , edged again with that mocking trace of Megan . " Advanced beings are not to be attacked ? " Obediently , as the missile left his fingers , he turned it slightly upward to let it miss the bugs . Before his vision went out , he saw that it would strike that red-glowing sentinel . " Defender ! You will not injure any being ? " The computer voice was fading , but its commands no longer mattered . All awareness dying , he was floating off the deck The blast had thrown him off the truck . He lay in foul mud , blood in his mouth , cold rain drumming on his back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought for breath , fought to drag himself farther , slid back into the muck . A second soft explosion . A gentle roaring , louder than the rain . He heard the driver 's strangled prayer to the mother of God , heard Prieto screaming . Poor devils , but nothing he can do . Howls and hoarse curses . Three quick  | shots . Then only the roar of the fire till the wet weeds on the bank above him began to hiss and crackle . Heat increasing . The rank stink of the charred weeds and a bitter whiff of burning hair and flesh . Cold rain trickling . Salt sweat biting where the hide had been scraped off his hands and cheek . He needed to lie there longer , to get his breath and clear his throbbing head . But the ammo Got to get further while I can . Head up and never mind the giddiness . Fight the muck and breathe the stink . Grab that bush . Claw up the bank . Slide back and try again A hard concussion . The ammo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee ? Damn thing numb and then the crunching pain . No good for anything . Down in the mud again on hands and the other knee , dragging the leg , scrambling for cover in the jungle . One royal hell of a fix for an old pro at the game , but I 'm not done for . Yet . Not if I can make it back to the wreck of the chopper and work the radio He was floating Somewhere in the dark . In the hospital tent , he thought at first . Under ether , maybe ; he felt no pain , not even in his knee . Butch and Mascarenas must have come back with the other chopper to pick him up . But where were all the jungle croaks and chirps and shrieks ? Where was anybody ? Trying to turn in the bed to see where he was , he found no bed . Only empty darkness all around him . He was actually floating , his body turning slowly in the air  --  but here , of course , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs drifting above him under the blackribbed vault . Killed ? Watching their slow tumble , he saw no hint of life or action . Two odd-shaped slabs of dull-gold metal , they had no visible limbs or organs of sense , no wheels or tracks or anything else projecting . Even the shining disk and the missile launcher were gone . Helpless , disabled , and adrift in that frigid gloom , he clung to his dulled awareness and waited for some new attack . None came , and he wondered dimly why . If the great spacecraft had been left in orbit to defend the planet , why had it fought him so feebly ? Perhaps , he thought ,  | those missing Landers had carried the crew away , leaving only the robots aboard . And , after thousands of years , perhaps they were running down . His own run-down body kept very slowly spinning , like a tiny world in space . The two dead bugs went by again , like companion planets . The black vault climbed again above him , an ominous sky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk . Floating near him , it was turning to light the deck beneath . When his own rotation let him see it , he found the shaft through which he had come , the radiating alleys of identical block-shapes around it , the taller thing the deflected missile had hit now no longer glowing . Dead ! " Master Program to Defender . " That cold internal reprimand shattered his momentary triumph . " You are defective . You have malfunctioned . You have killed advanced inhabitants ? " " The missile was their own . " Stubbornly , he defended his rebel self . " They fired it themselves , inside their own craft . They should have known it had to hit something . " " The being it struck was killed . " The sternly brittle voice still held a hint of Megan , Megan sounding hurt . " A being of advanced intelligence . " " If it was a being ? " The nearer bug was swimming back into view . Not quite floating , it was falling , as he himself was , drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw that it would pass close enough for his foot to reach it . Nerved with a sudden hope , he twisted to find the drifting disk . It at least was still somehow alive , still luminous with energy he needed . Eagerly , he measured mass and distance and velocity . When the bug was near enough , he nudged it with one weak toe . A feeble nudge , but enough to send him gently toward the disk . If not exactly toward it , maybe close enough . He waited , judged its motion , reached again . His fingers touched it , turned feebly magnetic , drew it to him . Basking in its power , he wished it had been stronger ? and wondered if his touch had turned it brighter . As that dead block-shape came closer , he swung the disk to find the spot where the missile had struck . A jagged hole blown in the dark metal case . Coiling  | cables beneath and thin shelves crowded with close-spaced rows of glittering crystals . Oddly shaped and strange enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves must be circuit boards . " Defender to Ship ! " Triumph surging high , he forgot that he was talking to himself . " The thing the missile hit was no live being . It 's a computer . On all the craft , I 've found no sign of life . No atmosphere , no quarters or stores for any living crew . " Which means we could try a landing ? " " Master Program to Defender . " Megan 's sad image quivered and vanished in his mind , a ghost he would never escape . " Repeat : mission canceled . Encounter with advanced orbital craft is itself adequate evidence of highly evolved technology here . " " But it did n't evolve here . The nuclear drives  --  everything about the craft says it 's interstellar . It brought invaders here from another star . Sent out by something its computers called the Master Builders , operating under what they called Attack Command . " " Master Program to Defender . " He hated its merciless insistence . " You found empty housings where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the planet . If high technology exists there now , from whatever origin , it is forbidden to us . " " We 've scanned the planet , " he protested . " We got no data indicating any sort of technology there . Nothing electronic . No visible signs of advanced intelligence . Perhaps the things that tried to land were robots , too . Maybe run down by now . Which means we are n't stopped yet " If I can get back where I belong ! " Hugged against his belly , the disk gave him a little life . He surveyed the deck as he fell closer , measured his way to the dark central pit . The shattered shell of the dead robot commander rose to meet him , and he thrust it aside with one bare foot . Deflected , he fell back into the shaft . Its dark walls drifted slowly up until a gray gleam struck through an oval door and he pulled himself out into the cold twilight that filtered through the tunnels from those empty berths . Carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the brightest tunnel mouth . Here , near the center of mass , his body flew true . He came out at last  | into the bottom of the hollow where a long landing craft had lain . Into healing sunlight . Anchored to the meteor-scarred metal at the tunnel 's lip , he drank it in . Slowly , the great craft rolled . The sun was gone too soon beyond the rim of the cavity , but it would be back . He watched the marching stars until the planet rose above the other rim . Splendid and immense , now near the full , it looked close enough to touch . He traced the snaky rain-dazzle of windcovergence around the equator , searched the blue-black zones of tropical ocean , found the cloud-piled archipelago and then the two great continents . Red flecks of desert . White glints of ice . Wider green reaches half veiled with cloud . Senses keener now , vision turning telescopic , he swept the visible land again and still found no hint of intelligent engineering . Searching the energy spectrum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storms . No evidence , he thought , that any invaders had ever landed . " Defender to Ship , " he called into space . " Hostile action ended . No evidence of advanced life now existing here in orbit or on the planet . Mission can continue ? " " Ship to Defender . " The answer came instantly , bright with Megan 's gladness . Her smile flashed across his mind , so lovely that old agonies awoke to throb again . " Homing on your signal . " He clung where he was , waiting for the ship and its haunting ghost of the woman he had loved  --  that they had loved , all those ghosts that haunted him . The good sun returned . Drinking in its golden wine , he pushed those poignant pains aside . Chance wisps of a world dead forever in the black abyss behind them , they would never really matter . Why should he care whether Don Brink had ever gone to war again or who had won Megan Drake ? He was the Defender , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could tell , waiting for him to plant and tend the human seed .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Tomislav was overweight , breathing hard because he had never become used to the mile of altitude , but still he walked too fast . " The tough part will be the back translation , out of computer language back into live human genes . And processing those into the minds and ways of our new race . The whole endowment of science and art and ethics and everything else it will take to make them really human . Out of the ship 's master computer , back into a civilization . " He wanted a drink , but alcohol would only make his reaction worse . His head was already stuffy , and the sunblaze hurt his eyes . He must be getting allergic to something in the radioactive mix . " There wo n't be labs . " Puffing , the big biologist turned at the curb to let him catch up . " Not on any planet where we can let a seedship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny ships themselves , down in environments sure to be strange , most of them hostile . " " With odds like that ? " He shook his uneasy head . " Do we really have a chance ? " " Perhaps the only one mankind will ever have . So Ben Bannerjee says , and I think he 's right . We 've got to make the most of it . " Tomislav himself looked worn with work and strain , sad eyes red and blue pouches under them . On his way now to phone his dying wife . " That why  --  why I 'm here . " Wearily , he wiped a sweaty shirt sleeve across his pale wet face . " When I ought to be back with Olga in La Jolla . I know the odds against any single seedship , but Megan hopes to launch a thousand . If they seem small for all they must accomplish , so do mustard seeds . " Still astonished at the thing he had become , he explored himself again and his dark birthcell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet yielding slightly to his searching fingers . The throbbing umbilical that linked him to the ship and powered him from its compact reactor . His own half-metallic flesh , colder than the cord . And his empty crotch Touching that , he tried not to let it hurt . Tried to accept himself as only a Defender , engineered not for any life of  | his own , but just to serve the ship . That ought to be , would have to be enough . The cell was tipped , so that he lay leaning on the wall . Searching , he found and struck the bulging opener . The wall cracked under him . Sliding through the thin-lipped slit , careful with the umbilical , he descended into symphonies of sensation . Something softly brittle , crackling to his weight . Hot sunlight , white and blinding . Whispering windsongs . Medlies of unfamiliar odor  --  vividly perceived through all his golden skin even though he did n't breathe . Briefly overwhelmed , he closed his eyes , dimmed all his senses , until he could adjust himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human seed . Megan herself had named it a million years ago , but the rest of it was mystery , altogether new , its treasures and its hazards not yet known . Maybe still damaged , the ship 's computer had at least got them here . If he could find feedstocks now Adjusting to the storm of new sensation , he opened his eyes on man 's new world . Green and black . Sun-fire blazing . He found his bare feet ankle deep in a lush carpet of vividly green fibrous stuff , a little like grass or moss . The little ship stood beside him , gold film blazing against the sun , his golden cord coiling up into his birthcell . Rockets and tail fins buried deep , it leaned precariously . He thought the landing must have been rough . " Ship to Defender . " Its synthetic voice wounded him again with that accidental trace of Megan 's . " We confirm difficult landing due to clogged laser injector . Fusion engines damaged on impact , now inoperable and beyond repair . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood . " He turned to look for that . A lake of breeze-ruffled green , the land lay level for several kilometers . Hills rose all around them , steep black slopes climbing to red-stained limestone palisades . He found no flowing water . " Flood ? " " Ship can not take off again to search for safer site . We compute indicated high probability of rain water trapped here in coming monsoon season , rising many meters deep .  | Ship can not survive immersion . Feedstocks must be replaced without delay . " " That may be difficult . What sort of stuff will do ? " It catalogued what they must have to build the new humanity . " Volatile hydrocarbons or other carbon-rich liquids . Our supply tanks still contain the other essentials : phosphoric acid , compounds of sodium and potassium , solutions of trace elements . We can process nitrogen from the atmosphere , hydrogen and oxygen from water , calcium from stone . What we lack is carbon in usable form for the assembler . The chemistry is not critical . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivatives . " " I 'll search . " And he added , " If we do find anything , we can probably salvage empty tanks and pumps and tubing from the propulsion system . To build processing equip-ment ? " Looking for hints of anything that might be processed , he turned to scan that wide green glade . Bright plumes were scattered across it : taller tufts of colored blades , orange , crimson , indigo . Flowers ? Their colors evolved to draw insects  --  or evolutionary analogues of insects  --  to carry pollen ? Wondering , he saw nothing crawling , nothing flying , nothing moving . The silence struck him . Except for a whisper of wind against the ship , he had heard no sound on Mansphere . A dim alarm chilled him . Searching from space , scanning the energy spectrum , they had found no hint of intelligence . No evidence , in fact , of any life higher than plants . He recalled those robots in orbit and the riddle of their mighty craft . An interstellar starship , its nuclear rockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years , the six landers gone from their berths . If the Master Builders had shuttled themselves down to the planet , where were they now ? Why had the ship observed nothing alive ? Nothing higher than these strange plants . Was something here deadly ? Deadly even to such sophisticated beings as the robot builders must have been and waiting now to kill the seedship and its human fruit . He scanned the green plain again , and the high hills around it . The growth on the nearer slopes looked jungle  | thick and strangely black . Above , the dark-red iron stains in the limestone cliffs had the color of long-dried blood . Turning uneasily back toward the ship , he shivered in spite of himself . It looked far too puny for its ambitious destiny . Half its gold skin had burned black in the heat of their descent , and a black wound yawned where his crudely welded patch had been torn away . Mankind 's best chance to live again , it looked achingly forlorn . " Ship to Defender . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely . Green eyes wide and dark and empty , sick with foreboding . She was staring at him , shaking her head , as the image shivered and vanished . " Report possible feedstock sources observed . " " Defender ? " Dejection checked his answer , but he tried to shake it off . In spite of such chance hints and glimpses , the ship was n't Megan . Like all his own longings and alarms , the bits of her in the computer were only accidental errors in the scanner pickup . " Defender to Ship . " He tried again . " No possible feedstock source observed within range of power cord . " Shivering with dread , he picked up a golden coil of the umbilical in both golden hands . Nearly as thick as his thumb , stiffly pliant , hot now from the sun and pulsing with the energies that were his life . " Then you must search farther . " " Before I can leave the ship , I must improvise another power source . " A moment of delay , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , without the use of feedstocks , to fabricate any alternative power source . " " Without power ? " " You can use sunlight . " " That is inadequate ? "  | A flash of searing pain . The golden cord dropped off his belly , whipped away across the green , vanished back into that dark slit from which he had been born . His vision dimmed . Mansphere faded like a dream . Its burning sun and pungent scents and breath-soft wind gone in an instant . Blackness crushed him down . Sirens screeching faintly , somewhere far away . The ambulance gently swaying . Megan beside him , holding his hand , tender as his mother long ago . Cradled in her care , he did n't have to worry over the drugs in his brain or the seedship project or anything at all Somebody moaning and hard heels clicking . The thin , chemical hospital odors . Bright light glaring . His own sweat , clammily cold . His head still drumming but now clear again . He lay on a hard , narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulver ? " Megan 's voice , and he saw her by the bed . " Okay now ? " Too damn much respect , but he did n't say so . " Okay . " His throat felt dry and sore . " Where am I ? " " The Lovelace clinic . You passed out in the scanner . " " Sorry ? " " We 're the ones to be sorry . " She was leaning nearer . He liked her wry smile and her lean-hewn features and the hint of scent she wore . " Seems you have an allergy to something in Tomislav 's brain transfusion . Sent you into shock . " " Can he try something else ? " " Better not . The specialists here say the next reaction could hit you harder . " " If he can  --  if he wants to try a different mix  --  I 'm willing . " " Galen ? " She made him happy , breathing his name . " Galen , I ca n't let you risk your life . " Her hand caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind  --  mind the risk . " His voice was weak , and  | he tried to clear his scratchy throat . " Let me  --  let me tell you why . " " Just rest . I 'll be back , but now you 'll need to sleep . " " Please ! " He clung to her hand . " I need to keep on trying . If you 'll let me tell you why ? " " If you must ? " Her fingers returned the pressure of his own . " If you 're strong enough ? " Gulping at the dryness , he tried to gather himself . " I was a sickly kid . " His voice came too faint , but she was bending closer , nodding . " Born on a Blue Ridge farm where things were pretty primitive . Polio before I was five . On crutches for years . A burden on my parents  --  for more than just the polio . Too much , I guess , for my father . He went north to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Mother worked to keep me . Sewing , painting china , typing reports for my uncle  --  he was an engineer , a sort of maverick freelance engineer . She did anything ? " He had to pause for breath and strength . " Too much , I guess . Kept me too close . Taught me at home till high school . She used to read aloud , and I learned to live in books . Never many friends  --  for a lot of reasons . None very close , though my uncle was exciting to me when he came with something new to type . I learned about science from him . Science and space . " Space  --  that got to be all I lived for . I built model rockets and my own telescope . Went through Georgia Tech . That with a lift from my uncle after mother died . Somehow got to be a specialist in nuclear propulsion . Early enough to work on Orion with Taylor and Dyson . A wonderful time . We were almost off to Mars  --  or thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile at Megan . " But of course ? " He was husky from the oxygen , and she raised his head to let him sip a little water . " Of course the funding stopped . The world got paranoid about anything atomic . Most of the others went back to something else , but I kept on . Dreaming about a new angle on fusion propulsion I could n't sell to anybody else . Doing math and drawing plans and making models when I could n't get support . " My life . " He sighed , not entirely sad about it . " The only life I 'd ever learned to live . Or ever really wanted , though sometimes I wished I 'd been closer to more people .  | I never married or even came near . Even now , I guess I 'm still a loner . " But ? " He could n't even try to say what he felt for her . The only woman he had ever known who really shared the dream of a fusion engine . Not that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too old for her or anything except this last alluring hope she had rekindled in him . " That 's the reason why , " he whispered . " Why I love ? love the project . My chance at space , when I thought the last chance was gone . So please tell Tomislav I want him to try another mix for the brain infusion . No matter if there is a risk . That is , if you need me ? " " We do . " Her green eyes and smile were medicine he needed . " Of course we do , if the doctors agree you 're really able . Nobody else really understands your ideas for the fusion engine or even thinks it could work . " She leaned quickly closer , and he felt her cool lips touch his forehead Waking unwillingly to the burning at his belly and the hard duties of the Defender , he knew Tomislav must have tried another mix . Otherwise , that moment with Megan could n't have reached the computer . He lay sprawled face down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his skin was drinking up its energy . Not so much as the umbilical had fed him but at least enough to let him move . He swayed to his feet . " Ship to Defender . " He hated the brittle voice , with its mocking trace of Megan . " Report your plans for securing vital feedstocks . " Plodding back toward the ship , he reviewed all he knew about Mansphere . Surveying it from orbit . Deciding to try the north continent because it seemed to offer the best resources . Selecting this humid southeastern peneplain , here just above the delta of a mighty river that sprang from the glaciers on the great central massif . With an unknown world to search , he had no plan . " Need is most urgent . Utmost haste imperative . Report possible sources . " Haste ? The word was a savage jab . On only sun power , he could n't move fast or bring feedstocks back even if he found them . Unless Could he use the disk ? Wondering , wondering even what  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Searchlight ? Weapon ? Power battery ? He neither understood nor trusted it . After it fell into his hands on the orbital starcraft , it had served him well enough . But before that , still controlled by the alien robot , it had tried hard to kill him . " Ship to Defender . You will take the disk . " He knelt to open the access door . The alien device lay where he had stowed it . A bit more than a quarter meter across , not half that thick . One face was black when he opened the door , the rest dull gold . As if in response to his touch , the black face lit . The disk was magnetic . When he slid it to his naked back , his own magnetic grasp could hold it there . In a moment , he felt the radiation from its glowing face against him . Far less than the umbilical had fed him , yet stronger than the sunlight . Perhaps it would serve again . " Defender to Ship . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll look for seeping petroleum or any sort of vegetable stuff we can ferment into alcohol  --  if yeasts exist here , or analogues of yeast , to ferment anything . Lacking data for any firm plan , I mean to work inland , keeping near the river . If I find feedstocks , I may need to float them back ? " " You 've got to find them , Don . " The voice suddenly almost Megan 's , tremulous with her emotion , calling him by Don Brink 's name . " Soon ! " When he reached the jungle , it was dead . A wall of cruel black thorns , tens of meters tall . Its leaves had fallen . A thick black mat , spongy now with rot , they stank with a strange reek he hated . His whole body sensed something deadly in them . - Quivering with revulsion , he stopped to study one lone unfallen leaf that clung among the thorns . Thick and tough and leathery , ribbed with dark-red veins , rimmed with fishhook spikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the live growth behind him . He found no fruit , nothing that looked fermentable . Something in the spiny leaf stung like poison . Flinging it aside , he pushed into the brittle tangle . The driving sun , combined with the disk-thing 's radiation , had fed him strength enough for his tramp out of the level swale , but the going grew harder now .  | Even though few leaves were left , the close-woven bayonets and barbs cut off too much of the sun , and they dragged too hard against his ebbing strength . The slope had grown too steep , and the slimy leaves slid treacherously underfoot . The pain in his navel grew sharper again , a craving for the power he had lost . Mansphere spun faster than old Earth , and night caught him still battling the tricky slope and the dead , unending jungle . The planet had no moon , and total darkness fell . Mind and senses slowed , he had to stop until his eyes adjusted to infrared . That lit an eerie blood-red glow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the rotting leaves . Guided by it , he toiled on until he came to the cliffs themselves . They halted him again , their ruddy glow too dim to help him climb them , and he had to wait for sunlight . Waiting , sunk into a groggy half sleep , he groped again for those stray shards of the men he had been : Tomislav and Rablon , Ulver and Wardian and Brink . Genetic engineer , computer designer , rocket builder , astronaut , mercenary soldier . All gathered by Megan for expertise to be recorded in the seedships ' computers , all held by what they felt for her . His fingers had strayed toward the ache in his empty crotch . He snatched them away , trying to recall what he was . A yearning half thing made of those mismatched bits , he hungered for wholeness . Most of all , he longed for Megan  --  hungered for her with the yearning of all those men inside him . They all had wanted for her , and she had given them all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless Ben Bannerjee ! Recalling how long she had known him , the tone of her voice when she spoke of Ben , the look in her eyes when she saw him , the tenderness of her touch on that twisted , child-sized shoulder , he wondered if Ben had been her real love . Not that it could matter now . She and all her men were a million years behind , only random accidental echoes in his brain . The sun rose . Life rekindled and senses sharpened , he found a water-carved slash where he could climb the cliffs .  | On a high ledge , he stopped to look back for the seedship . Far below him now , shrunk with distance , the level swale was a shining emerald set in black . He could n't see the ship . " Defender calling . " " Ship to Defender . " The answer came instantly . " Awaiting report . " Guided now by the signal , his telescopic vision picked up the ship . Absurdly small and futile , leaning crazily . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hope to grow . After a moment , he shrugged and spoke again . " Reporting no success . No indications of seeping petroleum or other geological organics . Nothing discovered fit for fermentation . No clues for farther search . " " Ship to Defender . " The merest trace of Megan . " Search must continue . " The Defender had not been meant to despair . He went on . Beyond the high rim , he found another dry black tangle floored with malodorous rotting leaves . It was eerily still , dead as the one behind , showing no more promise of any feedstock source . Too brittle for him to climb , the jungle blocked his view of everything ahead and cut off half his energy . The human snippets in him might have turned back or simply stopped , but he was more machine than human . The machine plowed on . Crashing through the jungle when it could , turning to try another way when it was blocked , stopping when it must to store power from the shadowed sun or the disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sank again . Dusk was closing in before he stumbled into a long , oddly rectangular clearing . Decaying leaves and broken stone piled the floor , but he came to a narrow strip where running water had washed it bare . Stone , oddly smooth and white and flat . Bending , he found seams in it , oddly narrow , oddly straight . An ancient pavement ! He explored it . The broken stones were fallen masonry , he found , when he brushed aside the rotting leaves to inspect them . Five tall white pillars towered above the jungle at one end of it . Remnant of a shattered wall rose at the other , a graceful arch surviving , and parts of a high curve that must have framed a vast oval window . Mansphere had been alive , with mind and art and high technology , before the black thorns grew . His vigor fading with the daylight , he staggered through that shattered arch into an infrared shadowland . Crimson javelins stabbed from the clotting dark , and he blundered into mountains of broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppled fragments puzzled him with their hints of tragic history . Bright as stained glass , so long as the waning light could show him any color , they were mostly white but sometimes black or sapphire blue or marble veined , shaped of something hard and dense as diamond . Many still showed clean curves and planes , tantalizing clues to what the ruins must once have been , but some had flowed into shapeless glassiness , perhaps from fire . His magnetic sense grown sharper in the dark , he felt metal beneath the rubble and the reeking leaves . Masses of crumbling rust that must have been machines , flattened blobs that had flowed to savage heat . This had been a city , a magnificent metropolis , murdered long ago . Stumbling on through ever-denser dusk , he came upon a huge unbroken dome swelling out of the debris . It was the pedestal for a tapered column topped with a dismembered statue that was eerily aglow with its own ruby incandescence . Shivering , he stopped to stare at the mutilated figure . Though head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost human . Almost a woman 's , but a little too thin for its soaring height , the whole anatomy deli- cately refined . She had been beautiful ; her tall perfection pierced him like a blade . Her humanity perplexed him . " What sort of thing will I be fighting ? " A stray moment of a million years ago , abruptly alive in his mind . A planning session in Megan 's office . They sat beside the glittering plastic-spiked stellarium , whose points of flashing lights were stars they hoped to seed . " Not you , Don . " Her fine eyes seemed quizzically ironic . " Remember , we 're picking up only a small part of you . " " Whatever  --  whatever you have to fight ? " Tomislav was flushed and wheezy , Albuquerque too high for his emphysema , and he had to pause for breath . " It wo n't be anything human . " " Or civilized , " Megan said . " We wo n't invade civilized worlds . Since we talked to Ben , Rablon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try that . " He loved her even when she scolded him . " Whatever you meet ? " Tomislav annoyed him , always lecturing at him as if he were a dim-witted freshman football star . " Civilized or savage , the odds are enormous that no creature you meet will resemble us . In our evolution , we 've made too many crazy turns for anything else to follow them all . " I doubt you 'll encounter anything as ferocious as you are . " He shrugged and grinned at Megan . An inspired creator , in love with all life , Tomislav would never forgive his own delight in the old game of mortal combat or even admit that the seedships might fall where they would need Brink 's fighting know-how . Her feelings for him were kinder and more complex Recalling that long-lost instant , the Defender grinned again , wondering wryly how the mostly silent bits of Tomislav still alive in him would feel about this murdered human or semihuman world . Was it proof that evolution here had retraced the human track ? Terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created predators more ferocious than mankind Another notion startled him . Could this dead race have been as fully human as the  | glowing statue seemed ? Sprung from another one of Megan 's seedships , planted here a geologic age ago , while their own was still disabled and adrift in space ? The statue 's seeming strangeness due perhaps to genetic alterations Tomislav had engineered into the seed or to long evolution since or simply to the divergent conventions of a different art ? The shattered figure could n't say . Wondering what sort of ferocity had come to kill the city  --  maybe all of Mansphere  --  he shivered to a chill of human dread . Was the killer still alive , waiting to blight whatever fruit their new seed might bear ? Heavy with weariness and shock , dull for want of power , he sat down on a red-burning stone  --  a tapered cylinder thicker than his body , perhaps one of the missing arms . Groggily , he wondered what that lethal agency could have been ? Something sudden , he imagined , overwhelming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomislav had taken such pains not to create ? An asteroid falling ? War without a winner Attack Command ? The robot watchers he had fought and stopped out in orbit darted back again to haunt him . The six landers missing from those empty housings on the starship  --  had alien raiders descended in them to devastate the unwarned planet ? Likely enough , that left haunting questions . Where were the invaders now ? Long centuries must have passed since the city died , maybe millennia . The starship 's nuclear rocket had been cooling for many thousand years . Were the invaders also dead ? Wiped out , perhaps , by some last desperate strike from doomed Defenders ? What sort of thing could have been so ferocious ? His locker stank when he opened the door to get the A papers he was taking home to show his mother . Everything was off the hook and the little shelf , all piled together in the bottom . His sweater had a cold , clammy feel when he picked it up . It was dripping wet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weak and awful , but he did n't throw up . He shut the door and stood with his back to it , cold and shaking , watching the other kids running past him  | down the hall . Most of them did n't look at him , but three big boys stopped for a minute , snickering and grinning at him . When they were gone , he went back to his home room . Miss Konick was still there , writing something in her grade book . Her bag was on the desk , and he knew she did n't like to be delayed , but she shut the book to see what he wanted . He could n't say the word to her , but he told her somebody had wet on the things in his locker . " I 'm sorry , Marty . " He wondered if she really was . " Do you know who did it ? " He did n't know who , and he did n't know why . He decided not to tell her about the boys that snickered because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll report the incident to Mr. Clough , but I do n't know what he can do . " He knew she was impatient to go wherever she went , but she sat looking hard at him so long he began to wish he had n't bothered her . " Listen , Marty . " Her bony face twitched at last into a worried scowl . " I 'm afraid there 's a reason things like this keep happening to you . " " Please ? " It was hard to breathe . " I have n't done ? done anything ? " " Not exactly . " Her lips set harder , and her stern eyes kept sweeping him till he was almost afraid to look at her . " But still there 's something somebody should tell you . I know these tricks are cruel , but in a way you do ask for them . " Choked up , trying not to cry , he could only shake his head . " You 're smart , Marty . You read a lot and know a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to realize that the other kids do n't like that because they think you 're putting them down . I know you 're upset now , but think about it , Marty . You might be smarter not to act so smart . " He could n't stop the stinging tears . " You may go . " She reached for the grade book . " But think about it . " The long hall was empty now . He dumped everything out of his locker into the waste basket and scrubbed it out with paper towels from the boys ' room and washed his hands with soap . The lock was broken , and he left the door open . Walking home , shivering without his sweater , he tried to think about it .  | How was he to blame ? He sobbed and shook his head , hating Miss Konick because she said he was . Hating Mr. Clough and those three boys and everybody at Jefferson Central because nobody really liked him . If he could n't even answer questions when the teachers asked Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groggily back to Mansphere . The planet 's murder had been a crueler thing . Its people could not have been to blame . Not unless they had made their world so rich and fine and beautiful that some alien creatures envied them . Anyhow , it was time to call the ship . " Defender reporting . " He paused to listen . " Defender to Ship . " Nothing . " Defender ! " He used all the power he could gather from the disk till the effort left him drained . " Defender calling to report discovery of extinct native culture , perhaps a human culture . No possible feedstock source so far found . No indication of useful feedstocks existing anywhere . " Nothing , still . " Answer ! " Human panic had begun to edge his voice . " Answer if you can ? " All energy spent , he sank back against the shattered arm . There would never be an answer , it struck him , not until he was closer to the ship , because it was below the cliffs he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been designed to cope with every predictable problem , but this wasted world could not have been predicted . The ship 's hull was not an efficient antenna ; neither was his body . He was all alone " Support Unit Alpha Ten . " The near voice jolted him . The swift , inhuman rhythm of the disk , when the robots had used it out in orbit to answer his initial contact signal . " To Unit Defender . Reporting information . Volatile hydrocarbons do exist here . " Dazed , he tried to gather himself . " Where ? Where are any hydrocarbons ? " " Volatile liquid hydrocarbons exist at Attack Base Alpha Prime . " " What ? " He was trembling with emotion the Defender did n't need . " What is Attack Base Alpha Prime ? "  | " Information . Attack Base Alpha Prime is command complex established by Attack Command as main support center for operations here ? " Static clattered in his head . " Here on planet designated Mansphere in your incomplete vocabulary . " " Is anything  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Command is not alive . " " What killed it ? " " Information : Attack Command includes no living personnel . " " So it was manned by robots ? Like those I met on the starship ? " " Affirmative . " " Is it still operational ? " " Negative . Operations suspended when local resistance ceased . " " When ? " " Attack Command suspended operations here ? " His head buzzed again . " Date in Mansphere time : nine thousand seven hundred eighty-nine orbital periods past . Data lacking for conversion to Terran time . " He had data for that . Farther out than Earth had been , farther from a hotter star , Mansphere had a longer year . Converted , the time since the planet 's death would be just over three hundred Terran centuries . Hardly a heartbeat , perhaps , against all the ages since Megan launched the seedships but still an enormity of time that woke him to an eerie instant of human emotion . The unchanging deathly stillness . The red-blazing spears and daggers all around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ruin behind him , still defiant of fate and fire and time . The mighty arm on which he sat . The tragic beauty of that mutilated nude towering through the thorns . Frozen in that moment of awe and terror , he shrugged to break himself free . Human emotion could only hamper his service to the ship . " The hydrocarbon feedstocks at Base Alpha Prime ? Are they available to us ? " No response , until he began to wonder why . " Hydrocarbons of type designated feedstocks exist at Base Alpha Prime . " The disk spoke at last . From out of sight behind him , out of reach , from beyond any human  | understanding . Its swift stacatto revealed no feeling . Of course not , he told his troubled human selves . Merely another machine , even less alive than he was , it had no feeling to be revealed . " Availability undetermined . " " Where is the base ? " " Information . Support Unit Alpha Ten to Unit Defender . Location of Attack Base Alpha Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's translation program turning data into words he knew . " Distance : one thousand seven hundred sixty kilometers . Direction : north , seven point one three degrees west of local meridian . Altitude : two thousand four hundred eighty-one meters ? " " Can you guide me there ? " " We can update distance and direction . " " Show me the way . " He swayed to his feet . " We 're going to determine that availability . "  | That night , he did n't get far . As the jungle cooled , the red fog thickened so that he could n't see the rubble barriers until he blundered against them . Every time he asked the disk , it told him very promptly whether he was facing Base Alpha Prime but very little else . When he wanted more facts about the base or Attack Command or the Master Builders , it reported data restriction or translation failure or , more often , made no response at all . To the human in him , the dimming crimson gloom became a shadow of hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,700 kilometers would be a thousand miles and more . The trek to reach it would take him too long . Without the umbilical , he lacked strength to carry enough feedstocks back to the ship even if he found them . Evading so many questions , the disk had come to seem a very doubtful ally . Yet the machine part of him kept running on to the limit of its power . Reviving when the sun rose , he climbed a rubble mound and tried again to call the ship . Again he got no answer . Pushing on alone , he came into a wide avenue paved so well the thorns had failed to conquer it entirely . He followed it north , tramping all day through amazing ruins he had no time to study . Night stopped him in the boulder-fields around a raggedly circular lake . A crater , he thought , where a missile from space must have fallen . Two days out of that haunted necropolis , the land began to lift . The dead jungle thinned enough to make climbing easier . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , at the rim of a high , seemingly endless parklike plain , still alive and softly green . Strangely enough , its growth looked more like the lichens and low shrubs of summer on the arctic tundra than the lusher stuff in the swale where the ship had come down , and its vacant expanse woke a stray recollection of the Kenya highlands , beyond the Great Rift Valley . A momentary bit of Don Brink , who had been sent there by agents of a man he never saw to kill a gang of elephant poachers and bring back the ivory in their camp . Meaningless to the machine in him , that fleeting memory left his human side wrenched and aching . The green vastness needed grazing things , impala or buffalo or cattle . But it was dead . No game trails or wheeling wings or voice of anything at all . Feeling wearily forlorn , he wondered whether the ship could ever really return it to life . A world without elephants would be a sad place . One without impala and cheetahs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mice  --  Don Brink had despised cats , but Rablon had loved them and women who resembled them , and cats would want mice . Perhaps , with all the genetic-engineering know-how Tomislav had programmed into the master computer , animals might be recreated . If the disk did not betray him , if he could actually find enough of the right feedstocks at the base , if he could get them to the ship with time enough before the monsoon floods drowned everything If  --  too much hung upon it . The axis of Mansphere was tipped nearly forty degrees . Enough to make its seasonal changes extreme . Every day stretched longer as they progressed farther north . The going easier , the Defender was many kilometers closer to his goal every time he asked the distance . Even at night , driven only by the disk , he was able to plod a few kilometers more . Every day the land climbed higher . The tundralike cover thinned and changed at last to desert : bare red rock cut with dry arroyos and only sparsely tufted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall . A noon came when he cast no shadow . A long day that let him make many kilometers , yet its very length alarmed him . Time had run too fast . The monsoon storms must already be marching off the ocean across the continent  | behind him . The flood waters would rise too soon around the ship , and the sun would too soon retreat south again , leaving him to the disk 's uncertain mercy . One cool dawn , he discovered a new shape above the fading infrared of the north horizon . An enormous moon rising , he thought for a moment  --  but Mansphere had no moon . " You observe Base Alpha Prime , " the disk informed him . " Distance one hundred nineteen kilometers . " Its shining wonder chilled him with dismay . A huge silver dome looming high enough to catch the sun while the desert lay still dark around him . The alien citadel , built thirty thousand years ago by the killers of the planet . Had they all been robots ? When he asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him only that no data were available . All the endless day , he watched that immense bright shape swell slowly as it climbed from the shimmer of heat on tufted scrub and naked stone until by sunset he could see dark ribs arching up across its mirror-brilliant fabric . A structure many hundred meters tall , city sized . The human in him tried to imagine what he might find inside . The secret of the planet 's death , perhaps the awful weapons used to kill it ? The feedstocks he needed  --  or ancient traps still set for anything alive ? Eyes lifted to its riddles , he failed to see the brink . Other perceptions checked him : a sense of the sudden decrease of surface density ahead and a muffled thunder from far away and far below , felt with all his skin . An unexpected chasm , so vast it struck him giddy . Shaken , he dropped to hands and knees to peer across the jagged edge . Bare stone fell sheer for thousands of meters to rocky shelves and broken pinnacles and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to find the river that had cut it , a narrow-seeming silver ribbon . That far-off roaring was water falling into clouds of shining spray . He recalled the gorge from space and this mighty river . Born of the glaciers around . the great caldera that had built the continent , it sliced down across this plateau to the southeastern ocean where the monsoon was rising . He saw no way across . " Defender to Unit Ten . " He collected himself to chal- lenge the disk . " Why did n't you warn about this barrier ? " " Data not requested . " " How can we get across it to the base ? " " Data restricted . " " We 've got to get into that dome . " Unexpectedly , something had turned it talkative . " Information : admission to Base Alpha Prime forbidden except to Master Builders . " " The things that built the robots ? " " Affirmative . " " Are they here ? " " Negative . Attack Command was launched to prepare the planet for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . " " You 've been waiting for thirty thousand years ? " " Information : computed by the revolutions of this planet , the delay is less than twenty thousand years . " " You still expect them ? " " Attack Command will wait until they come . " " Then I 've got a surprise for you . " Even to him , the words were startling . Don Brink 's more than the Defender 's . " Things change as ages pass . Living things evolve , even the Master Builders . That is why you did not recognize me . I am a Master Builder . I have come with new orders that now control Attack Command . " The disk dimmed its radiation . Without its power , he swayed to his knees . " If you command Attack Command ? " Its swift rhythm became hesitant and faint . " You will repeat recognition signal . " " Recognition signal is restricted . It is reserved for direct communication to Attack Command alone . " " Information : Attack Command now inactive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will ? " It cut him off . He fell through red gloom , almost into the pit . Palm Springs in scorching July . Up at dawn , he had found his own breakfast and hiked out beyond Tramway Road , explaining to skeptical city cops and private guards along the way that he was a house guest of Victor Vane . The whole sky was burning before  | he got back , but he had learned to love desert heat , and the air-conditioned house felt clammily cold when Vane 's silently efficient Filipino let him in . " Hullo , Brink . " Puffy eyed and rusty voiced , Vane beckoned him into the kitchen . " Our chance to talk , with the women still in bed . " Wearing a dirty bathrobe , Vane looked sallow and broken , years too old to fit his movie image . " We played poker last week , and I 've heard how good you are at your special calling . I 'm hiring you to win a poker pot . " " Listen , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just to kill time while I 'm waiting for the right sort of job at the right sort of pay ? " " I 'll pay . " Vane was mixing himself a Bloody Mary . His hands shook . " And if it 's danger you need to make the job feel right ? " " I do n't cheat , if that 's what you mean . " " Your opponents will do the cheating . If you 're sharp enough to catch them at it , you 'll see . " Vane shuffled to sit at the bar . " I 'll outline the job ? " " First , I want a drink . " Vane was offering the bottles , but he wanted cold water . He got it at the sink . " Call me an idiot , " Vane was muttering . " But I 've been robbed . Playing poker for stakes I could n't afford on a yacht out of Long Beach . With a con man , it turns out . A slick bastard who claims to be a Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart enough to hire a private agency to find out what he really is . " " So ? Why do you need me ? " " Listen , Don . I ? " He stopped to gulp the rest of his drink . The glass clattered when he set it on the bar . He sat for a moment merely staring , ravaged face twitching , a mute appeal in his bloodshot eyes . " Sorry . " With a pained grimace , he jerked himself straighter . " Things have gone bad , Don . I was on the ragged edge before I met that thug . Fool enough to think I might win enough to pull me out . Now ? " He sloshed vodka into his glass and tossed it off straight . " The last chance I 've got  --  if you 'll help me grab it . " Vane shivered as if he felt the clammy cold . " A scam of  | my own . " His bleary eyes turned anxious . " If you 'll lend your able hand ? " " Scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Here 's the scheme . I 'll introduce you as a playboy banker out from my own home town . Your dear old dad has just passed away . You 've come into the money , and you want action . I 've got together eighty thousand dollars  --  not mine , Don , and about the last I can borrow . Twenty for your advance , if that 's enough , and sixty to show . They do n't know how totally broke I am , and we let on you 're into millions . " The crook will likely have a couple of honest suckers at the table , along with his shills , conning you all along  --  with my money . I 've watched you , Don . You can beat the rat , and you 're sharp enough to catch him if he tries to cheat . Play it right and you can take his gang for a million-dollar pot . " " If he 's what you say ? " " He will cheat . Or try to if he 's losing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you might need to fight . " " I do n't like that sort of fight ? " " You can beat him , Don . At the cards or however . I 'm betting  --  betting everything . " Vane looked at the vodka bottle as if he needed it . " I know the odds look a little grim , but from what people say , it 's the sort of sting you can carry off . " " People talk too much . " " Quick money , Don . " His voice fell , hoarsely pleading . " Whatever you win  --  and get away with  --  we split between us . Even . Could be half a million apiece . Maybe more if we 're lucky . " His lax lips twitched . " They took that much from me . " " How do we get off the yacht ? " " I 've got a speedboat . Luis will be out in that , waiting to dart in and pick us up when we flash a signal . " Trembling , he leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like it , Vic . " He squinted into Vane 's disappointed eyes . " Too much like the script for one of the B films you used to make when I was a kid . I 've got a code , and I 'm not crazy . No matter what you hear people say . " But ? " He had good uses for a sure twenty thousand . Even for his share of that speculative pot . Besides , that sagging ,  | wasted face kept stabbing him with ironic recollections of the clean-featured screen hero Victor Vane once had been . The magnificent image he had taken for his boyhood guide . " You 'll go ? " " A chancy thing . " A little sadly , he scowled at Vane . " But perhaps it might be done . With air-tight planning . If we can trust Luis ? " Half awake in the still-crimson dawn , he groped for recollection of the game on the yacht . Nothing came except the drowsy certainty that Don Brink had lived to play his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , he tried to stand and sprawled again beside that red abyss . The disk was gone . Too weak to move without the disk , he lay drinking up the first cold sunlight and groping for ploys against Attack Command . A grimmer opponent , he thought , than Don Brink had ever hired himself to fight . The stakes were big enough : mankind 's rebirth . His opponents , alien robots . The rules unknown . Were bluffs allowed ? Probably not ; the disk had not seemed naive . Its disappearance left him wondering why it had ever aided him . Simply to use him for a vehicle to bring it to the robot base ? And left him now because he could carry it no farther ? He saw no certain answers .  | When he could , he rose to look across the brink . The mirrored dome stared back , a blind , enormous metal eye , mocking him with secrets too remote for him to guess , with the promise of all he wanted and power to kill the human dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Yet its very nearness tantalized him  --  the intervening gulf slashed four kilometers deep , its giddy walls too steep to climb , the white water roaring down the inner gorge still another barrier . Alive with the climbing sun , he plodded north along the rim , west and north again , searching for a crossing . Higher toward the main massif , as he recalled from orbit , the great river had n't cut so deep . Perhaps , somewhere up above the falls  | Perhaps He tried not to dwell upon all the hazardous uncertainties around him here or the monsoon floods already creeping from the coast to drown the seedship . He had nearer tasks enough , to pick his minimum-energy path across the rock-ribbed desert , to avoid the stone that might turn or the brush that might trip him , to drink all he could of the sun . That giant eye followed even when the twists of the rim made him turn his back upon it , bright and blind , never farther , never nearer . Once , yielding to hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien gaze . Never even winking , it stared him down . Machine again , he toiled on . The sun itself turned foeman . Nearing the zenith , it bathed too little of his absorptive skin . Reeling groggily through the blazing noon , he almost went over another unexpected precipice . The lip of a branching gorge , slicing south across the desert as far as he could see . Too small to show up from space , it looked appalling now . He was swaying on the rim , scanning its sudden cliffs and tricky talus slopes , looking for any possible path , when he saw the flyer . A high , dark mote with a thin red tail , it came from toward that glaring silver eye . His own eyes turning telescopic , he watched it drop to wheel a kilometer above him . Its design puzzled him . A trimly tapered shape the color of weathered aluminum , with stubby airfoils that looked too small to control it . The crimson tail was heat from a pulsing jet that seemed inadequate to lift it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less hope than sheer desperation , he hailed it . " If you receive me , please acknowledge . " It did not acknowledge . " Master Builder to aircraft . Message to Base Alpha Prime . Top priority , instant transmission required . We have arrived to complete our ancient plan for this planet . We require full control of the invasion base and all other facilities on the planet or in orbit , effective now . To that end , we hereby demand immediate identification of all existing units of Attack Command . " Aircraft will now transmit recognition signal . "  | Circling very slowly in the brassy sky , it transmitted no signal . " Master Builder to Attack Command . We require two metric tons of volatile liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks supplied at once to the rocket vehicle in which we landed . We have information that such feedstocks are available at Base Alpha Prime . You will indicate plans for instant compliance . " It indicated nothing . " Master Builder to aircraft . Information for emergency transmission to Attack Command . Subject : consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attack Command will be disabled , as we disabled orbital starship . " Still no sign . He shook his fist and staggered south . His human hopes began to lift as the westing sun added a little to his energy . Again and again , he stopped to search the gorge until at last he found a chimney that with luck might take him down to a sloping ledge that looked like a path to the faraway floor . The other wall still frowned forbiddingly , but the machine in him was not dismayed . He scrambled over the rim and into the chimney . It proved difficult , its weathered walls crumbling unexpectedly . He was too feeble and too clumsy . Deadly shadow crept into the lower gorge and climbed too fast to meet him . A wisp of cloud drifted into the narrowed sky . Perhaps a finger of the far monsoon . Sudden , paralyzing dark Somebody banging at the door . Men shouting at his mother . Cops with guns rushing at him  --  then backing away , crouching to look for somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected . " You 're Martin Rablon ? How old are you ? " " Fourteen , sir . " " If you 're really Rablon ? " The cop stopped to scowl at him and his computer . " I 'm Lieutenant Karst . We have a search warrant for these premises . A warrant for the arrest of one Martin Rablon . You have a right not to talk till you see your lawyer ? " He could hear his mother , still downstairs , asking quavery questions . " Sir ? " He was getting up , but the cop waved him back  | into his chair . " Please , would you tell me what you think I 've done ? " " If you 're actually Rablon , you 'll soon be telling the judge . " The other cops were all over his room . Pawing through the tools and parts on his work table . Dumping his computer magazines off the homemade shelves . Dragging everything out of his closet . Even rolling up the bed to look under the mattress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? " Karst pointed the gun at his desk . " That 's a computer ? " " Yes , sir . " Still frightened , he was proud of the computer . " I guess it does look like junk . Mostly built out of salvage parts , still on breadboards . But I 've got it work-ing ? " " What 's it for ? " " Games mostly . Mom lets me hook it to the TV . " " Games ? " Karst bent to squint at the flickery little CRT . " That 's a game ? " " Part of one , sir . A subroutine in a program I 'm doing for a new space adventure ? " " By God , Harry ! " The other cops had dumped his wastebasket on the floor , and one was waving a handful of fanfold paper . " Here 's where he hid it . " Karst snatched the crumpled paper and scowled at him again and rushed downstairs to use the phone . He heard his mother , shrill with fear . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was telling her . " But now I think the bank may want to modify some of them . We 'll go there first . " Security guards at the bank marched him into a glittery office with Mr. Preston 's name on the long , clean desk . There were chairs , but nobody offered them . Three bankers came to sit scowling across the desk . He knew Mr. Preston 's fat bulldog face and little rimless glasses from the TV commercials . " Mrs. Rablon . " Mr. Preston waved the fanfold sheets and growled at his mother . " Do you know what these are ? " White and trembling , she shook her head . " These are bank records . " He was loud and angry . " Our most confidential records . The names and account numbers and current balances of our largest depositors . Corn- plete with all their secret computer passwords . Information that enables the thief  --  the holder , to transfer any amount of money to his own accounts anywhere in the world and then tell the computers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was only a freak of luck  --  a malfunction , in fact , in one of our computers  --  that led to our detection of the culprit . " Red jowls quivering , he stopped to glare . " How did your son obtain them ? She looked at him . " I just phoned , " he told Mr. Preston . " With my computer hooked to the phone . " " Phoned ? " Mr. Preston was turning redder . " You expect us to think you got free access to God knows how many millions  --  actually billions ? Just by telephone ? " " Yes , sir . " " Who 've you got with you , working this scam ? " " No  --  nobody , sir . " " Martin ? " The youngest banker was quieter , suddenly almost friendly . " Would you tell us how you did it ? " " With my computer , sir . " " And aid , I imagine , from confederates in the bank ? " " No , sir . All I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . I used the numbers on my mother 's cash and credit cards , and the punched cards about the penalties , when she was overdrawn . " " You wanted to get the penalties back ? " " No , sir . That would n't be honest . " " You did n't take anything ? " The younger man had begun to look relieved . " Anything at all ? " " No sir . Just to test the program , I did tell it to take one cent from each of the twenty biggest odd-numbered accounts and credit one cent to each of the biggest evennumbered accounts . But I did n't take a cent . The next day , I had the program put the pennies back where they had belonged . " " You ? " Mr. Preston was a mad bulldog trying to bark and strangle on a bone . " You ? " " I  --  I 'm sorry , sir , if that made trouble . Just twenty pennies , out of all those billions , and the totals still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You  --  you whelp ?

Now I think I see what you 've been doing . Will you tell us why ? " Shrinking from the red fury trembling on that bulldog face , he had to gulp before he could speak , even to the friendly man . " Sir , I saw Preston on TV . Promising everybody that your new electronic banking system was absolutely safe because your security codes could n't be broken . I wanted to see if what he said was true . " " The impudent ? " Mr. Preston shook and wheezed and sputtered . " Impudent ? " The other banker stopped him , pulling at his sleeve and murmuring at his ear . He growled and glared and finally stalked out of the room . The friendly man came around the desk to where they stood . " Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . I guess they 'll be surprised when they hear what you 've done . " Wanting to smile , he grew serious again . " A serious violation of the law , but I 'm pretty sure Mr. Preston will agree for the bank to drop our charges . That is , if you 'll promise not to meddle again . " " I  --  I promise , sir . " " Mrs. Rablon , you have an unusual son . Are you sending him to college ? " " I 've always hoped to . " " I believe the bank can arrange a scholarship if he 'll do some work for us . " His smile had broken through . " Martin , I imagine our computer people will be setting up a new security system . I think we 'll want you to help us tell how safe it is ? " Waking slowly to a dull crimson glare , he thought at first that he was still fourteen , living with his mother in the shabby old house in Winnetka . Wondering if Mr. Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call his mother , but he had no voice , not even strength enough to lift his throbbing head . But his eyes were open . He saw the tall cliffs , glowing faintly infrared , and knew then that he still lay sprawled where he had fallen , on a steep gravel slope below that crumbling chimney . He was n't Martin Rablon any longer , but stranger memories haunted him . Machine-shapes dancing , too quick and too queer for him to see them sharply . Computer machine-language rat- Cling in his head , too fast for him to understand . Mr. Preston 's security codes and secret account numbers and computer passwords , mixed up somehow with identification signals and control programs set up by the Master Builders to direct Attack Command . His head ached . He could n't remember anything . Not clearly . Yet somehow he felt a lot better about everything . Because now he would n't have to get across the canyon and steal feedstocks and try to get them back to the ship before the monsoons came . Relaxed , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strength enough to stand . Somehow not surprised , he found the flyer waiting on the ledge beside him . The same trim jet-powered craft that had come out of the base to follow him . Somehow he knew enough to fly it now , though most of its mechanism was still as enigmatic as the disk itself . The mass inverter that loaded ordinary water into a reversed gravity well to make a gravitic mirror  --  that did n't fit the physics he knew , though he thought it might explain the motion of the disk . Other items he understood . The laser injectors that drove the fusion power unit , the airfoils and the flight control system , the tiny jet engines that burned hydrocarbon fuel  --  old Galen Ulver , working with the craftsmen of some other world , might have been the design engineer . He was n't certain whether the disk had actually been bluffed , yet he saw no other reason for it to leave him the flyer and its fuel . Five metric tons of volatile liquid hydrocarbons , more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight precisely compensated by five tons of lift from that perplexing mirror effect . All he had to do was spill enough of the uninverted water ballast to match his own weight and the flyer would be afloat . With the monsoon rains only just begun , he could be back in time . Score one more , he thought , for Rablon and Brink and all Megan 's team , even little Ben Bannerjee , in their desperate game to keep mankind alive . Shivering a little , remembering the scanner 's chill when you had to lie naked in it and the giddy sickness you always got from Tomislav 's isotopic mix trickling out of the needle into your brain , he climbed into the cockpit.  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | The range , no doubt , was still too great , his feeble signals too completely muffled by the airframe around him . Gliding down now toward the sun-gilded towers of monsoon cumulus , he imaged the landing site . The cliff-rimmed cup , the scowling scarps of black thorn jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright cloud-wall into gloomy chaos . Convection battered him , too savage for his little skill . Sun power cut off , his golden frame sagged against the controls like an unplugged machine . Awareness flickered and with it all his eager human shards of memory and feeling , dimmed like candles in the wind . He lost the ship 's location . Yet he clung to himself , striving to make the most of his diminished energy . Adjusting , limiting every motion , he fought though a wild updraft and dived again , down out of the dense cloud-roof that lay upon the cliffs . In clear air , he searched the rain-hazed hollow . Already flooding . A mud-red torrent foamed down from the canyon above it , and a broad yellow lake was rising from below . Rising fast , toward where he had left the ship , its dead rockets buried in the swamp , the battered hull leaning crazily . He could n't find it . The human seed He reeled with human panic , but the machine in him was still efficient . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon he found the toy-sized craft . It had fallen over since he left , and it lay too near that sudden yellow sea . " Defender to Ship . " Overwhelmed by the absurd futility of all their toil and pain , he felt a shock at his own computer 's crisp , unfeeling precision . " Aboard aircraft coming in to land . " " Which Defender ? " Too long delayed , that brittle crackle held no hint of Megan , and the question dazed the human shards inside him . " There is only one Defender . " Another endless instant , then the same swift , inhuman twang . " Correction : you are Defender One . Information : when you failed to report or return from search for replacement feedstocks , we programed the production of two additional  | service units . That effort has overloaded all facilities , depleting emergency feedstocks carried for Defender reproduction , but Defender Two has been safely born . Successful birth of Defender Three not yet certain ? " " I did n't  --  did n't know this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human emotion than he could handle . " Where is Defender Two ? " " Two has flown to the south coast to obtain replacement carbon-rich feedstocks for the retranslators .

" The metallic jangle cut him off . " Defender Two has reported analysis of oils now in stock or transit . They answer all requirements , and we are already adapting assembler programs to utilize them . " " Have we time ? " Stunned , he had almost forgotten the flyer . Caught in a sudden squall , it pitched and veered , swept toward the cliffs that rimmed the upper canyon . He fought to save it , feeling too feeble and slow at the controls . " Flood problem resolved . " The toneless staccato came from far away . " Defender Two has lightened seedship by removal of useless fusion engines and other equipment now unneeded , sealing hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a secure location above high water , where translator supplies are being stored . " In command again , the machine in him wheeled the little craft safely away from the mist-hidden cliffs and glided down through gray skirts of rain . Dropping the intake hose to suck up ballast water , he landed near the ship . Back safe  --  but his human elation had been shattered . Clambering heavily out of the cockpit , he stood swaying giddily , ankle deep in weeds and mud . His skin tingled to the manifold odors of Mansphere : the rankness of the drowning weeds , the swamp 's dank reek , a faint foul taint of the dead thorn jungle , washed down on the floods . Mixed with stranger scents , hints of ominous enigma . His dimmed perceptions were overloaded . " Defender  --  Defender One to Ship . " Even his own computer signal had become uncertain .

" Defenders Two and Three will be more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We compute no present need for service from Defender One . " " I exist ?

" " But , please ? " " Ship to Defender One . Production of Unit Three requires all available capacities . Communication terminated . " Drained of everything , he stumbled to the seedship and fell across his birthcell in its narrow nose . The slit was closed . Scrabbling along the narrow seam , he found the bulge of the opener , hammered on it with a feeble fist . " Ship to Defender One . " The quick synthetic voice rang cold as the driving rain . " Information : production chamber is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ready to emerge . Umbilical unavailable to you . " He slid down into the mud He saw Crowler walking ahead of him off the plane and hailed him inside the terminal . " Judge ! " Once a county judge , Crowler still enjoyed the title . " Wait up ! I did n't see you . " " Marty ! " Crowler came grinning back to meet him and gripped his hand too hard . " I got on at Atlanta . First class , of course . " " A coincidence . " He had never really liked Crowler , but he tried to smile . " I 've been on a consultation trip to work with your engineers up in New Hampshire , but I was n't expecting to see you back here . " " You whiz kids ! " Crowler 's grin widened , more tolerant than deferential . " I 'm just a country lawyer . Your gene synthesizer ? " He shrugged its wonder away . " Just a black box to me . " " A steady-flow multistage process . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the baggage claim area . " Completely automated . We meter the purified feedstocks through computer-regulated jets into a controlled flow of biocatalytic silicones .

We can install any natural gene we have in computer memory , or any new one you care to invent ? " " My own genes will do me . " Crowler had n't really listened . A football quarterback , still athletic , he was half contemptuous of anything academic . " The legal end is all I want to know about . I 've come down to meet with the university regents . Just to make sure they do n't intend to claim an interest in your patents . " " No problem . You wrote the waiver clauses into my employment contract . " " We do n't take chances . I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too genially , Crowler clapped his shoulder . " Never worry , Marty . GEECO 's going to make a fortune for you . " " Jayna would love that . " " I imagine she would . " Crowler 's overhearty voice had fallen oddly . " I 'm renting a car , by the way , if you want a ride to the campus . " " Thanks , but Jayna 's driving out to meet me . " He found himself adding , almost against his will , " She 'd love to see you . Maybe we can meet for dinner ? " She liked Crowler . The big lawyer had been here at Kingsmill half a dozen times this semester , first persuading him that it would n't be unethical to divert his computer science into commercial genetic engineering , then negotiating all the contracts . A cofounder of GEECO , rich with Texas oil , Crowler had taken them both to a game at the Astrodome and a weekend party at his Houston mansion , a rather wild affair that she had enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Wish we could . But I 've got to make an early-evening flight . To join friends for a South Sea cruise . " Crowler 's luggage came off first . Expensive new-smelling leather in brown canvas covers . It was sitting outside a phone booth when he carried his own battered bag to the  | exit ramp to look for Jayna 's maroon convertible . She was n't there . He waited ten minutes and decided to call the house . The leather luggage was still outside Crowler 's booth when Marty dialed from the next one . The line was busy . Still busy , half a dozen times . He was outside the terminal , waiting for a taxi , when Crowler overtook him . " Stood you up ? " Crowler looked amused . " Let me drive you home . " He accepted . Crowler drove silently , preoccupied . Marty sat thinking uneasily of Jayna . Caught between academic demands and the press of his work for GEECO , he had been neglecting her , but now he could make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes she wanted . Time for travel after commencement . To Japan , maybe , with a chance for him to meet the top computer people there . He found her standing in the bedroom , staring at a goldframed portrait . Their wedding picture  --  his heart paused when he saw what it was . Just out of the shower , she was rosily glowing and fragrant in a filmy robe . A tide of lust swept him toward her . " Hold it , Marty . We 're all through . " Gliding aside to evade his hungry arms , she sailed the picture at the wall . Glass jangled . She gestured at the bed , and he saw her cosmetic case and travel bag still open where she had packed them . He stood blinking at her , suddenly too weak and sick to speak . " I did n't expect you to take it so hard . " She shrugged , inspecting him with an air of almost casual detachment . " Bob 's picking me up after his session with the regents . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Texas friends . " Animation warmed her well-kept , smoothtanned features . " They 've got a yacht . " " Jay  --  Jayna ? " His voice broke hoarsely . " Why ? " " I suppose you do n't know why . " She paused to nod , frowning at him more critically . " Because you 've never understood me , Marty . Or anybody , really . Except your damned computers . I guess you think I ought to be sorry for you because you think you 're hurt . But honestly , I 'm not . " Her flash of hard resentment shocked him . " I know you like to screw me . That 's what you 'll mostly  | miss . Why you look so sorry for yourself . But the fact is , you never knew or cared for what you had .

He still loved her as he always had , more than he had ever loved anyone , in the only way he could He came painfully awake , lying face down in matted weeds and icy muck with rain drumming on his back . Martin Rablon no longer , he thought for a moment he was Don Brink again , sprawled in the muddy ditch where he had fallen beside the burning ammo truck in that Colombian jungle . He thought he had to get farther away before the mortar shells began exploding , but he felt too weak to move . Able at last to lift his head , he found the seedship 's patched and battered hull beside him in the mud . It looked too forlorn for its great mission  --  not that he had to care . The new Defenders would be assuming all his duties , and it did n't matter who he was . e found no heart to speak to the ship , and it did n't speak to him . Feeble in the monsoon gloom even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claw at the worn hull to pull himself erect . Beyond it , he saw a little pile of rusting metal . The ruined Ulver engines Defender Two had discarded , with their laser gear and pumps and pipes and cables . Junk .  | Swaying weakly in the rain , he shook his head and turned away . For that was what he was . Standby status , duration indefinite . Because the ship no longer needed him . The machine in him dead , the human side still sick with Rablon 's dazed desolation . But he found the flyer when he turned . Still his to use unless the ship required it . Its lean gray lines revived human hope , human wonder and imagination . If he was n't wanted here , it could carry him to explore more of Mansphere , to grapple again with the planet 's unsolved riddles . In time , perhaps , what he found might earn him active status . For Defenders could be needed even after the new Adam and the new Eve came naked from the machine . Mansphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cursed ground outside , gone to thorns and thistles . Literal thorns in the jungle . The curse just as real , and deadlier . The robots he had met Satanic enough , conquerors of the planet once and waiting now for the coming of their builders and masters . He had bluffed the robot once . Or had he ? Leaving the  | flyer for him , with fuel enough to serve as the feedstock he had been demanding , they had stopped far short of recognizing him as one of their Master Builders . What now ? Would they allow the new human colony to live ? Or act to wipe it out as ruthlessly as they must have exterminated the race whose relics he had found ? What if the actual Master Builders really did arrive , thirty thousand years delayed ? Any answers he could discover might still benefit the mission . At that thought , the machine inside him moved again , and his battered human spirit lifted . Alive once more , he had to think of energy . His eyes returned to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so thick as his lost umbilical but maybe thick enough . Splashing through the muck , he gathered the scraps he could find . Perhaps thirty meters altogether . He stumbled with them back into the cockpit , out of the rain . Slow and clumsy in the gloom , he spliced and welded them into a single cord and shaped a terminal to fit the scar that was his navel . Recalling things he had n't known he knew , learned perhaps while he had lain in unconscious contact with the alien disk-thing , he opened a hatch in the deck to wire himself to the flyer 's generator . The shock knocked him out . For a moment , he was Don Brink . A green kid again , his first time in the ring , billed as the Mystery Mauler in that stinking little Tijuana arena . Set up for a knockout before he ever learned how to fight , he saw Bitterman 's shills making bets they would never pay on him to win , setting up the suckers to be taken . Half blind with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage rounds before he got the killer punch In another moment , or what seemed like one , his bodymachine had adjusted itself to the unfamiliar current . He hauled himself off the deck , feeling good again . When he looked out of the cockpit , even the sky seemed brighter . In fact , it was . The rain had stopped while he was out . He saw blue sky and a shaft of golden sun . " Defender calling ! " Megan 's voice , more human than he had ever hoped to hear it . " Defender Two to Ship . Returning with oil nuts from  | the south coast . Will drop them at the upriver production site . " If the ship replied , he did n't hear . Looking in the direction of the signal , he found a bright diamond flake flying down that shaft of sunlight . His eyes went telescopic , and he saw her . Megan , winged ! Flowerlike , the first gorgeous bloom of the manseed here . Nude and beautiful , her perfect body brightly metallic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long and trimly tapered , golden veined , shimmering in the sunlight with a flow of flashing color , their mechanism not entirely clear , though he could see that her own hands and feet controlled them , fitting into grips and stirrups . The oil nuts were slick brown egg-shapes the size of coconuts , carried in a net on her back . Though they must have made a heavy load , she was gliding easily , the rainbow wings hardly moving . He followed her up the flooding river , lost her behind a jutting cliff . He sat watching , dazed by all he had n't known and wounded with an unwilling envy , until he saw her soaring back out of that cloud-shadowed canyon into dazzling sun . Gliding low above the yellow foam of the rapids , she tipped the brilliant wings to pause and hover for an instant over the ship before she lit on its tapered nose . Megan ! Transformed into a golden goddess , crystal winged . Not thirty meters from him . Quivering , only half believing , he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roll themselves into a trim double backpack . She stood looking at his flyer with a bewitching frown of wonder . Overwhelmed with feeling , he could only stare back at her , tangled scraps of memory whirling through his mind . Broken moments of eagerness and aching pain , when Brink and Rablon and the rest had loved or lusted for her a million years ago . None of them had ever seen her naked , not that he knew , or so utterly lovely . This gilded vision showed him all of Megan as she must have been , full breasted and complete . The lean , high-cheeked features and all her flowing grace . Even the golden eyes held a glint of Megan 's green .  | They found him . " Don ! " Megan 's voice , grown even more musical , startled and delighted , calling him by Don Brink 's name . " A dream I never hoped to see ? " She jumped toward him off the ship . Scrambling out of the flyer , he splashed through the muck to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more alive than he was . Bare , hot and passionate against him , her searching mouth to his . " I 've been so lonely , Don . So terribly alone ? " Luminous with joy , she drew back to look at him . " Guess now who holds thee ? ' " Softly quoting the lines , she shivered . " Not Death , but Love . ' " Thirstily , desperately , she crushed him back against her , but then she must have sensed his agony . " Don ? " Her rapture sank into a sea of terror . " What 's wrong , Don ? " Cold and quivering , he pushed her back to let her see his naked crotch . " Oh  --  Oh , no ! " Her body grew rigid against him . " I 'm so sorry for you , Don . So terribly sorry . " He felt her shaking as if with human sobs . " What  --  What happened to you ? " " Nothing ? " His own voice broke . " Except  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the mission . Not for sex . " " So  --  so am I ? " Her trembling whisper sank , but she shook her head in hot denial . " But I remember when I was Megan  --  a lot of her got into the computer , the same way so much of Don got into you . Her love for you  --  and all the terror and the pain she was trying to escape with the seedship project . " Oh , Don ? " She clung hard against him , velvet and agony , till he moved to ease the clumsy coil of his power cord between them . " A horrible joke . " A bitter little laugh . " Fate has played such dreadful jokes on both of us . When I woke up here in Eden , remembering how we loved each other  --  how emptily  --  how we died without each other a million years ago , I thought of Emily Dickinson . " Her voice fell again , whispering : " Because I could not stop for Death , He kindly stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immortality ? ' "  | She shivered in his arms . Aching for her , for both of them , he wanted to console her . " We 're still Defenders . " His own voice seemed unsteady . " With our work  --  our work still to do . That 's what we were made for . The way we feel  --  feel about each other  --  it 's all an accident . " " A dreadful , dreadful accident . " A lead-colored cloud-roof had rolled back across the cliffs . In a sudden gust , cold raindrops pelted them . He nodded at the flyer . Wordless , she climbed ahead of him into the cockpit . At last , with less emotion , they talked again . " There must be guests in Eden  --  all the rooms are full . ' " Her tawny-green eyes resting sadly on him , she seemed to be remembering . " Egan loved poetry  --  I guess I never told you . We used to read it aloud . Sad , romantic stuff about love and death . We wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some of his were wonderful . I wanted him to publish them , but he said they were just for me . " Her eyes caressed his face . " How do I love thee ? ' " she murmured . " Let me count the ways . ' " She reached as if to touch him , but her hand fell back lifeless against her shining thigh . " I never forgot you , Don , " she whispered wistfully . " The way you were the day I found you in Acapulco . Your knobby thornwood cane . Your knee still in that awful cast . You looked old . Old as Uncle Luther when he died . Sick as poor little Ben . And you were so terribly down  --  I could tell by the look in your eyes and the shave you needed . " But I loved you , Don . I 've always loved you , from that very day . " Her hand caught his . Golden , warmer and stronger , maybe tapered a little more gracefully than he remembered Megan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't quite know why . Because I knew what you were ? " " A professional killer . " He grinned at her wryly . " Once you called me that . " " Soldier . " Her hair was fine golden wire , very short , worn in Megan 's way . Gently reproving , she shook her head in a way it wrenched him to recall . " I hated killing ? or thought I did . Hated most of the causes you said you 'd  | fought for . But I could n't help admiring you when I got to know you . The cool way you looked at everything , ready to battle anybody . And  --  and all you are . Somehow you woke feelings I did n't know I had ? " " You woke a lot of feelings in me . " Ruefully , he squeezed her hand . " Not that I could put them into poetry . Or that you ever let me do much about them . " " I know . " Somberly , she smiled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that dreadful scowl turned to a grin . You looked brave again and twenty years younger . I knew what you wanted before you ever hinted . Because I wanted it , too . " " You always put me off . " " You thought I was a fool . " Her face tight with pain , she glanced down at his sexless nakedness and very quickly away . " Now I know I was . But then ? " Her fingers gripped harder . " I could n't help what I was  --  the part of me that did n't get into the computer . " " The part  --  the part that put us here . " He tried to smooth his voice . " So I guess we ought to be grateful . Wardian used to say it was your misdirected or maybe redirected sex drive that kept driving you to get the seedships engineered and built and launched . " He added , " We all talked about it , because I think we all wanted you . " Frowning thoughtfully , she nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew ? and I suffered for you , Don . Suffered for myself . For all I could n't help . " Her arm slid gently around him , and she seemed to sigh . " I 'd grown up  --  grown up wounded . Egan went to shrinks and wanted me to . He said we 'd been too close just because we had nobody else . I do n't know . I did miss him dreadfully when he was killed . Until I found the project and the six ? " " Six ? " " The men with me . " She leaned to scan his face . " With me in you . " The gold-green eyes turned sad . " And poor , poor Ben . Ben Bannerjee . Gone because we could n't pick him up . Never well enough for the scanner , but he ? " He felt her tremble . " He 's alive in us still . If we gave the mind , Ben gave the soul . " She was silent for a time , staring through the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I loved him , Don . And all the rest of you . Even Marty  | Rablon . An egotist . Brilliant with computers but never able to show how much he cared for anybody . Marty needed me . " A wistful smile touched her face . " And Galen . Poor old Galen Ulver . Could have been my grandfather . Dying , really , when I found him because his dream of space was dead . He loved me  --  most of all for reviving the dream . Enough to keep him enduring those scanner isotopes in his brain . " The smile gone , she frowned into the rain . " Ivan was harder to reach because he cared more for the project than for any of us . Obsessed , of course , with guilt for his wife and staying with us as a sort of atonement . Creating life for this new world because he could n't save it there . " Hard to love , but my heart ached for him . " He waited for her to go on , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . " So there was a Deluge , ' " she murmured , " and swept the World away . ' " " That 's most of us , " he prompted her . " But what about Wardian ? " " Captain Mack ? " Her eyes widened , startled . " I do n't see Captain Mack in you . " " I do n't recall much of him . " " I might  --  might have loved Mack Wardian . " She looked off into the storm . " A lot of women did . Because he was the image of any girl 's hero . Lean and handsome in that yellow jumpsuit , born with wit and social grace Marty never learned . He shared what I felt for Emily , at least enough to quote her once . I taste a liquor never brewed From tankards scooped in pearl . Not all the Frankfort berries Yield such an alcohol . " Her voice turned wistful . " Yet he never let me close . I never quite knew why because he was always charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as anybody to get us into space . " A moody pause .  | " Not that any of it matters now . " Her voice seemed forlorn and far away . " Not with all of them  --  all of us ? dead so terribly long ago . Just thinking of them now ? " She shivered . " It makes me so dreadfully sad . Sadder than I ever was , even back with Egan . " Not very cheering . " He moved a little from her on the seat , easing the awkward pull of his umbilical and trying to break himself out of her gloom . " But they were all troubled people trapped on an unhappy world , spending their lives  --  the best of their lives  --  to give mankind this new chance . We 're here to finish what they started . With help , I hope , from another Defender when it 's born ? " " Defender Three is n't an it . " Cheered more than he expected , she was smiling at the rust-washed seedship . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown , and mostly Captain Mack . "  | egan 's office in the Albuquerque lab . " We 've established the technology . " Rablon , as usual , too masterful . " Automatic gene transcription into computer code . Automatic retranslation , out of that and back into new human beings , on planets where the seeds take root . What we need from you is know-how to help us get them sowed . " Marty Rablon . Tall and lean and sallow skinned , with black-rimmed glasses and too much black hair . A genius , no doubt , but unduly arrogant about it and generally hard for him to take . " A fabulous project if you can pull it off . " He turned to Megan . She was easier to look at and the reason he was here . Fresh and young and lovely , as intense as Rablon about the project but fetchingly modest about her own brains and beauty , maybe unaware of how desperately she tempted him . Probably a virgin and off limits to him . " We 've come a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , he wondered for a moment if she might lead him to break the code . " But now we need you terribly . " " There are other astronauts . " " We 've checked them out , and we always come back to you . " He frowned uneasily at Rablon . " You want to transcribe my mind ? " " Impossible , " Rablon rapped , as if that had been an idiot question . " All we want is a computer transcription of  | your space skills . For all those wild press reports , we ca n't read minds . The scanner works indirectly , through computer analysis of the input from half a hundred channels ? everything from brain waves and unconscious muscle tensions to isotopic radiation modified by synaptic biochemistry . " Wardian looked again at Megan . " How long does all this take ? " " Too long . " Rablon spoke for her too promptly . " Several weeks to get the computer pickups tuned to the individual brain . Sometimes longer , because the process is n't perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filter out what we do n't . " Resting on Megan , his owlish eyes seemed possessive . " Dr. Drake was our first victim ; she has spent a day or so of every week in the scanner for nearly two years . " " A long ordeal . " She looked both apologetic and enchanting . " Minds are tricky to transcribe , and the scanner is n't altogether automatic . We 'll need you here at least a few months . " " I 'm sorry . " Seeing the hurt on her revealing face , he hated to say it . " But I simply do n't have that kind of time . " " If it 's money , Raven Foundation has it . " " It is n't . " To ease her disappointment , he had to say more . " I 'm an astronomer-astronaut . Half my life , I lived for space . NASA gave me just one mission . One wonderful month in the orbital observatory . No funds in sight for anything more . I resigned to fly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a better chance . " " Better ? " Rablon seemed indignant . " Think about it , Wardian . What we offer you is a kind of immortality . Time enough for you  --  a selected part of you  --  to reach the stars . " " The thing I mean to do will more likely kill me . " With a shrug for Rablon , he turned back to Megan . " You 've heard of the Solar Sail ? We hope to sail it out to Mars . Nothing official yet , but we 're setting up an informal group . People from Nasa and the European Space Agency and even the Japanese . A six-year flight , out and there and back . The whole thing chancy , with long odds we never do get back . A ten-person crew , with landing craft and equipment for a surface station . I 'm in line to be the senior  | scientist  --  if I quit Delta now and work full time with our planning group . " With that coming up , the best I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captain . " Her urgency touched him . " At least tonight . We 'll put you up here at the lab . Dr. Tomislav 's flying in this afternoon . Talk to him and let Marty show you how the scanner works . " He agreed . Only partly because the concept of the seedship had taken hold of his imagination . Her own unconscious allure was stronger . The scanner looked like a ten-million-dollar torture chamber when he saw it , and Rablon 's brags about it turned him further off , but he did want to meet Tomislav , a Nobel prize winner for his epochal advances in genetic engineering . An aging man , overweight and haggard , breathless when he got to the lab . Megan took them all to a Mexican restaurant for dinner . The chile rellenos were too hot for his taste , and Rablon lectured too long on the software interfaces between DNA and his micromolecular memory cubes . He was glad when Tomislav said he had to phone his wife and get some sleep . Back at the lab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She talked about her twin brother , who had conceived the project , she said , to redeem his brief and tragic life . About the crippled Indian genius and her own Uncle Luther , who had been captured by the dream and passed it on to her . Her light lilac scent seemed stronger in the car , and he felt half drunk with her unsuspected physical allure . Yet he did n't try to touch her . His code forgotten , he found his first respect for her mind and her ideals merging into something he had never felt for any woman . A passion so close to worship that he felt unworthy of her . Lying a long time awake in the bare guest room , he reconsidered the style and the aim of his life and his plans for that possible Martian adventure . Set against the daring grandeur of the seedship project and his new adoration for her , that uncertain chance to die on Mars began to matter no more than his flying or his hang gliding or the casual sex the code had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready for the scanner .  | She wanted to know where he had been . " The ship said you left to look for feedstocks . Right after it landed . You never came back . That 's why Three and I had to be programed . " Out in the rain , he had n't noticed her odor , but now it filled the flyer 's narrow cockpit . A fragrance new to him , though he thought it held a hint of Megan 's lilac scent . Its exotic hothouse power was suddenly overwhelming . His whole body tingling to it , he felt a blaze of hopeless lust . Sick and quivering with the agony of that , shrinking from her excruciating loveliness , he collected himself to tell what he had found on that long trek north . The ruined city seemed to astonish her . " A human city ? " Her green-gold eyes went wide . " How can that be ? " " Perhaps our seedship is the second one to get here . " " If so ? " Even her frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Attack Command , the robot disk-thing told me . " " Robots ? Here on Mansphere ? " " As I piece things together , they exterminated everything alive on the planet . They 've been waiting all the ages since for whatever sent them . " The ship had told her about their encounter with the great orbital starcraft and its robot crew , but she seemed dazed by what he said . " I 've flown thousands of kilometers . " She shook her head , reluctant to believe him . " Up the river . Down it to the coast . To the offshore islands where I found the oil nuts . I have n't seen any ruins . Or met any robots . " " You would n't expect many relics left . Geologic change must have buried nearly everything . The ruins I found , and the statue , were of some diamondlike synthetic stuff . Even it was mostly shattered , maybe by missiles from space . I found the crater . " Silent for a moment , she seemed convinced . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing even like insects . " She bent toward him , shivering . " Do you think the robots killed everything ? " " I wish I knew . " " That will be our next duty now . " She sat straighter , her voice grown firmer . " To find out if the robots are still a danger . To defend the ship against them if they are . We  | must learn what they did . What weapons they used  --  no missiles I can imagine would kill a whole planet and leave it habitable . " " I was thinking that . " He shook his head , deadened again by bleak depression . " But the ship does n't need me now , not since it programed new defenders to replace me . " " It will , " she promised him . " When we report the situation . But it ca n't talk now . It 's too busy with Three . " " I hope  --  hope it finds some duty for me . " His voice quivered . " Though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fought them on the starship , and I played a sort of game against the disk . To what I guess is a draw . But still I do n't understand them . " " How 'd you get the aircraft ? " " I claimed to be a Master Builder . One of the creatures the robots have been waiting for . " " And it believed you ? " " You never know . It never told me much . I think it tried to drain my brain while I was out , but it was gone when I woke . It did leave the flyer for me to find . Maybe just buying time to study us . Even if they do believe ? " He tried to look aside , to break the ache of her loveliness . " They must still be watching us . Maybe from their orbital craft if they 've been able to repair it . More likely using other agencies we do n't know about . They 'll learn too soon that I was lying . Whatever we decide to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it now . " " Not now . " He could n't look away . " Not till we have Three . " Eagerness alight in her gold-green eyes , she peered through the rain-haze to the lake and the tiny machine that had been their womb . " He 'll be here soon . Unless ? " Frowning , she turned again to him . For a moment , she was wholly Megan , with the same frown lines he recalled from times of trouble with the project . " We 're never quite  --  quite what we were programed to be . " Even her tremulous whisper was Megan 's . " Because of all the genetic malfunctions caused when that micrometer hit the master computer . The ship is afraid of a difficult birth . " omething startled her . Silent , listening , she shivered in distress and turned from him to climb out of the flyer . " Megan ? Is something wrong ? " When she did n't answer , he knew the ship must have called her on their private channel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nose . Perching there , her back to the driving rain , she spread her crystal wings to shield the birthcell . The narrow hull lay flat , rust-red now where the gold was gone . Yellow waves were already breaking around it , and the cliffs above them echoed the roar of falling water . The water was rising fast .  | Watching her , he felt heart-wrenching pity . In spite of her gold-filmed body , her vivid wings , and her computergenerated brain , she was still terribly human , nakedly vulnerable . " Megan ? Can I help ? " She ignored him . Her circuits were all busy , he supposed , with the problems of the ship and the dangers to Defender Three . He ached to aid her , but Defender One was no longer required . Sitting helpless in the cockpit , he could only watch her battle with the beating rain . The day dragged forever , with no word from her . He saw her wings sagging , saw their rainbow colors darkening into drab brown and gray . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings absorbed . Open wide to the  | sun , they worked superbly , but in the battering wind she could n't spread them far . He called twice again , offering to let her have his own power cable , but she gave no sign that she received him . Dusk fell , and the moonless dark . Seen by infrared , she became a crimson ghost huddled under the monsoon squalls . Dim crimson glints danced on the black waves around her . Her wings were lifeless now , plastered flat against the hull , and still the new Defender remained unborn . Another night of endless waiting . He sat by Olga 's bed or stood beside her or sometimes paced the hospital room . The night before , he had injected her with his synthetic virus . He meant it to be benign ; he had engineered it to repair her rare genetic defect . A secret , desperate medical experiment , made without informing her doctors because there had been no time for any normal testing and because she herself had begged him to try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schrad and Brickman back from their homes to bring her through the crisis . He felt certain from their faces that they knew what he had done , but they made no accusations . Restrained , he supposed , by their respect for him and by helpless sympathy . They knew she was terminal . Her condition , late that second night , had finally stabilized . Reeling with fatigue , he stayed on with her , though Schrad wanted to put him to bed under sedation . Watching her , hoping for some delayed positive effect , he remembered how vibrantly alive she once had been . Once Miss Schenectady . They met at Union in freshman biology . Half smitten himself , the instructor introduced her to the class . Tall and straight , radiantly alive . She stood up , smiling and winking at some friend in the class but then blushing shyly , and he adored her instantly . Hopelessly . Conscious of his accent and his ethnic origins and his lack of social aptitude , he could only envy the dapper instructor who somehow knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were assigned to work together in the lab , dissecting a cat . It made her sick . He could n't help laughing when she upchucked into the sink . Furious and beautiful , she slapped at his face and grabbed her books and ran out of  | the lab . Afterward , amazingly , she forgave him . He did the dissecting , she kept the notes , and they lived together after the second semester of their senior year . Now  --  when he saw the terrible flatness under the blanket , heard the slow , raw rasp of her unconscious breathing , saw her balding skeletal head with the oxygen tubes in the nostrils and the fixed rictus of pain on her shriveled , unconscious face The recollections were unendurable . He stalked the empty corridors and came back to look at her again and yet again . No change . Never any change . He knew at last there never would be . Because the genetic damage already done could not be reversed . Even at the best , his virus could only prolong her agony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olga , anyhow The infrared was fading into gray daylight before Defender Three was born . The rain had stopped , but the rapids still boomed down the canyon behind him , and the ship was half afloat in the muddy lake . Megan crept back from its nose , dragging her lifeless wings , and he saw the birth-slit gaping partly open , still crimson with the vital warmth she had been protecting . The new Defender was a strange helpless-seeming thing at first , pale wings crushed close around its twitching limbs . He saw golden hands thrusting , grasping , parting the thin wing-tissues . Saw the golden head lifting Wardian ! Blinking into the light , cocking his head to listen to the thunder of the rapids , raising a wavering hand to shade his eyes , peering out across the lake to the black thorn jungle , finding the flyer on the shore and waving cheerily at him . She had told him Three would be mostly Mack Wardian , yet he shivered at the likeness . All gold toned , but the arrogant nose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing smile when he found Megan . The eyes , even , were flecked with Wardian 's blue . The sun rose clear . Feebly at first , clumsily wavering , the wings spread to drink its light . They stiffened swiftly , opened wider . Life began to flush them . Pale pastels brightened into patterned panes of sapphire and emerald and ruby framed between the darker ribs .  | Aching with an unwilling envy , he watched the new Defender step from the birthcell to stand on the rusting hull . A golden god , diamond winged . The wings shifted , giving him a frontal view . Anguish stabbed him . Three was fully male , as magnificently male as the original human Wardian must have been . Megan 's wings had brightened , too , their drabness become rainbow wonder . She raised them high , shook the water off , tipped them to the sun . Perched now on the tail of the ship , she was a splendid human bird , golden glowing , luminous with joy . She must have spoken to Wardian on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find her . Shivering with electric delight , the two came very slowly together on the waist of the ship . He watched them kiss , hesitantly , gently , then lock hard together . He saw the umbilical come away from Wardian 's belly and retract into the birthcell . The dark slit closed . And still they clung together , fused with a desperate fervor the programers could never have planned . Clung forever , moving only to follow the sun with highswept wings . Watching from the cockpit , he tried not to hate them , tried to remind himself that all their feelings , even his own savage bitterness as much as their burning passion , were only accidental hazards to their duty as Defenders . But the machine in him had been turned off , discarded . Wholly human , he felt wholly hopeless , abandoned and alone . He tried to tell himself that he ought to share their joy . Though they might never know , he had made them what they were . If he had not replaced those damaged memory cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as sexless as he was . Maybe Megan , too . The irony of that was a blade twisting in him , because he could not repair himself . Could the ship reprogram him ? Hopeful for an instant , he shook his head at the notion . If he asked , the ship 's computer would merely remind him that sex was not included in the duties of a Defender . It would probably add that the making of Two and Three had used up those special feedstocks brought all the way from ancient Earth . The new Defenders took a long time recharging , but at last they slipped apart to soar one by one off the ship and  | drop near him on the shore . The shimmering wings folded , rolled against their backs . Hand in hand , they walked toward the flyer . Relieved , he slid out to meet them . " Hullo , Brink . " The golden man stepped ahead , speaking with Wardian 's pleasantly precise and faintly British accent , smiling with Wardian 's casual confidence . " Megan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement feedstocks . " Trying to seem happier than he was , he gripped the powerful half-metallic hand . " You captured this machine ? " Wardian swung with a grin of admiration to inspect it . " A novel sort of lift ? I 'm keen to look it over . You know , old boy , we Defenders have got a gorgeous mission here . " " I did n't know ? " Flinching a little from Wardian 's fleeting glance at his patched-together umbilical and his naked loins , he could n't help recalling his own standby status . " I did n't know  --  did n't know about you and Megan . " " I believe the oil nuts she found will meet our needs . " Wardian reached back to catch her hand and draw her to his side . " Though our best congratulations are certainly due you . Considering ? " Wardian caught himself but went on at once , his fluid tones grown too hearty . " You did it , Don ! A remarkable victory . Considering all your handicaps , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things undone . " " At least ? " Seeking escape from Megan 's quivering pity , he turned to the lake and the half-drowned hull . " At least we have the feedstocks now . The mission can go on . " " In time . " Wardian nodded . " Though actual production will have to wait . Megan has the ship sealed and trimmed to float . As soon as the flood crests , we can tow it up the canyon . Megan tells me she has cached a good supply of oil nuts there , on a bench where we can haul the ship above high water . " " Can I ? " Urgency wrung him . " Will I be needed ? " " I hope you are . " He felt Megan 's anxiety for him . " I 'll try to find a place for you . " Do n't sweat it , Don . " Wardian dismissed his concern  | almost casually . " We 'll do whatever we can . But we 've got more urgent problems calling for us now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that we blame you for giving up what was impossible for you . " He swayed where he stood , feeling faintly ill but trying not to show it . " Our first priority has to be learning what killed the planet . No point in producing people if they ca n't survive here . " He had to nod . " Beyond that , we 've got to check out your reports on those alien robots . We need to know a lot more about their origins and their history and the military base you say you saw . Specifically , we 've got to verify that they actually accept us as their creators . " " They left the flyer for me , " he said . " That 's all I know . " " We 'll soon learn more . " Wardian smiled into the clearing sky . " Time to take off . For a look at the city you found and a search for whatever killed it . We hope to get back before the ship 's afloat . You 'll be standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected . " Megan came on to him after Wardian turned away . Her golden arms gathered him against her nude , unendurable splendor , and the hint of lilac in her scent was tearing agony . " I 'm sorry , Don . " He knew the words were just for him . " So dreadfully sorry , because you know how terribly  --  terribly I loved you . Weaned from life and torn away in the morning of your day . ' " She kissed him , pulled away , and drew him back again , quivering against him . " But you see ? " She turned in his arms , looking after Wardian . Bright head high , facing the lake , he had spread splendid wings . A forward leap and he lifted off the muddy beach . " Chin up , old boy ! " he shouted as he climbed . " Defenders do n't despair ! " Clinging to Megan for one last bitter instant , he had to let her go . Her green-gold eyes were fixed on Wardian , as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of all the souls that stand create , I have selected one . ' " adly , fixed in unwilling wonder , he followed them into the sky . Wardian seemed uncertain at first , and Megan hovered near , but soon they both were climbing strongly . Beyond the black-rimmed lake , where the wind struck the high red cliffs , they caught an updraft that let them soar into the sun . They dwindled until his eyes went telescopic . He could see their eager faces then and sense their rapture . High and free , they danced together . Spinning , diving , darting close enough to kiss , whirling through games of pursuit and escape until she let Wardian capture her . Dead inside , he looked away when they mated .  | His father was a mining engineer , orginally British but a naturalized American . They lived in Montana the winter he was fourteen because his father was making a new survey for Canadians who wanted to reopen the old Silver Belle . Miss Krimkin was his teacher in the three-room Bell Butte school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Today was an icy February Friday , with a bitter north wind gusting down the canyon past the empty town , and he was afraid he would never see her again . His father had finished the survey , and they were leaving for Denver tomorrow . He missed the bus on purpose after school and hiked three miles in the snow , down to Mercer 's Mercantile . He  | had eleven dollars , with the ten from selling his skis , and he spent it all for a Valentine chocolate box . The numbing dusk was thick before he got back . He was afraid Miss Krimkin would be gone , but her Chevy was still parked against the snowdrift outside the building . He saw Mr. Wranker 's pickup over by the gym ; he was the principal and the coach , and he liked to work out after school . Everybody else was gone . Trembling and breathless , his heart pounding hard , he slipped into the old brick building . In spite of the cold , his hands were sweaty on the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to tell her how he felt . He stopped in the hall outside her room , afraid of what she would think . But tomorrow  --  tomorrow would be too late . He pushed inside . The air seemed oven hot , sharp with the sulphur smell of coal in the red-hot stove and rich with her exciting perfume . Two Coke bottles and a whiskey flask stood on her desk with the grade books and her bag , but her chair was empty . He heard her make a sort of gasping cry before he found her . She was lying on the floor by the upset coal scuttle , with Mr. Wranker half on top of her . Staggered , he shrank back into the hall . He had always liked Mr. Wranker , who had given him his old skis when the first snows came and taught him how to use them , but now he felt numb , stunned by what he saw . He wondered for a moment if Mr. Wranker had raped her , though he did n't know much about rape . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , he felt too weak and queasy to move or even think . At first , he could n't understand . Then , looking back at the bottles on the desk , he remembered something his father told him when he wanted to know about his mother . " Never trust a woman . " His father 's pale eyes had an odd , far-off look , and his voice seemed sad . " I guess you 'll have to love ' em . They 'll all make suckers of us , every bloody one , till they 've got us where it hurts the most , and then they crucify us . " Suddenly , now , he felt terribly sorry for his father . Now he understood the way they lived , with no real home , and he knew this was a lesson he would not forget . When he heard Miss Krimkin shriek with ecstasy , he pulled the door  | very carefully shut behind him and tiptoed back down the hall . Outside , he threw the chocolates into the snow . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were gone beyond the cliffs . Gone on to learn how Mansphere had been murdered  --  and no doubt to make skyborne love again . He watched all day , but they did not return . Before sunset , the monsoon clouds rolled in again , and blustery squalls swept back across the lake . " Defender One . Defender One to Ship . " He hardly dared expect an answer because he had been thrown away , but he was afraid for the ship . The muddy waves were higher now , washing against the hull , now and then breaking over it . He wondered if it would really float . He received no answer . " Defender One to Ship . " Desperate , he tried again . " Do you have contact with Two and Three ? " " Ship to Defender One . " Its brittle , synthetic voice spoke at last , now without that haunting trace of Megan . " Contact with Defenders Two and Three lost when they flew beyond radio range . We are standing by on all channels . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I serve ? At least till they return ? " " You remain on standby status . No service now required . " The gray dusk faded into infrared . All night the rain drummed on the flyer and raked the dark lake . The ship lay deep in it now , flickering dimly crimson through the waves that broke across it . All night he watched it from the flyer , listening to the unending thunder of water in the canyon , longing for something he could do . " Defender One to Ship . " He called again at dawn . " Do you have contact ? " " No contact . " " I 'm taking off , " he said . " To attempt radio contact with Two and Three . Climbing out of the valley into line-ofsight range of a wide area . My signal should reach far beyond the ruins they planned to explore . " " Ship to One . Confirming reassignment to active status . Contact with lost Defenders rated urgent . You will attempt to reach them . " Active status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skyrocket exploding inside him , but his mechanical half had no time for joy . Already busy , it was moving to dump ballast for the flight . He took off across the flood water , which now spread south and east in a vast brown sheet until it spilled through a gap in an oddly straight , far-off hill . The hill , it struck him , must once have been a dam , built to hold a great artificial lake now filled by long millennia of silt . Wheeling away from a squall , he turned back into the canyon . Just inside its cliffs , he found the shelving bench where Megan had planned to take the ship . A broad ledge , still half a dozen meters above the lake level , sparsely overgrown with something green . Searching with his telescopic vision , he found her preparations unexpectedly complete , with tons of oil nuts neatly stacked against the cliff . A small machine stood beside them : a simple press , neatly built , ready to extract oil for the ship . Stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back in time to rescue the ship and finish its ancient mission . He soared over yellow foam and booming chaos , climbing into the clouds and out again at last , into the sun 's hot dazzle . East and south as far as his vision reached , the floor of cloud lay luminous and level . North and west , all along the rim of the high plateau , the cumulus towers were blue ice and white fire , with that shattered city lost somewhere beneath them and the dead thorn jungle and all the riddles of Mansphere . " Defender One calling ! " Though the flyer 's frame interfered , he tried to beam his signal toward those hidden ruins . " Calling Two and Three . Urgent . Please acknowledge . " Listening , he , heard nothing . " Don Brink . " The human cry escaped his computer controls . " Calling Megan ! Calling Captain Mack ! Answer if you can ! " Again he tried , still again , until he feared there would never be an answer . " Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The faint robotic voice cut him off . " You will return at once . Ship afloat and in danger . Defender service now required . " Service now required !  | He could n't help a thrill of human satisfaction , though it came with a pang of human guilt , and it left him still anxious for the new Defenders . They were lost , their fate unguessable , and he felt unworthy to replace them . Lacking their wings , their special adaptations , he was ill prepared for anything . Yet  --  and in spite of himself he shivered with elation  --  he was no longer junk ; the mission was again his to defend . The ship was gone when he reached the lakeshore , but he was able to follow its signal to where it drifted like a sodden log , already half a kilometer closer to that narrow spillway . Hovering gingerly over the ship , he nudged it with the flyers ' landing skids , rotating it to find the rusted fittings where the auxiliary drive-mass droptanks had been attached to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were jettisoned . He reeled out the ballast hose and took on water enough to settle the flyer very gently on the unstable hull . Scrambling down , he used loops of his umbilical to lash the seedship 's fittings to the aircraft 's skids . When the rain paused , he drew power through the umbilical to weld them fast . Back in the cockpit , he towed the ship out of the current , toward the head of the lake . Gray rain was sweeping in by then , but he did n't really care . The machine in him was running again , with a programed function to perform , and he was not unhappy . Hauling the ship out of the water would have to wait until the flood had crested , but good feedstocks were ready for the translators now and there would be time enough to process them into mankind for Mansphere . Almost happy now , he remembered a fiesta . Blazing sun and blaring bands and the overpowering cologne of the general who had hired him . Adrift in a golden haze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine with the reeking general and half a dozen tipsily giggling senoritas , following a captured Izquierdista tank from the captured presidential palace to the cathedral , where a captured Marxist bishop was waiting to bless the counterrevolution . Crowds were cheering El Bolivar Nuevo , who was the general , and el commandante Breenki A million years ago .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | mind was nearly overwhelmed . Swaying on the little platform , clutching the rail , he leaned to look again into the newborn man 's wet , bewildered face . In the green-flecked eyes , he saw a hint of Megan that wrenched him again with aches of love and loss he thought he had forgotten . The stubborn chin was a haunting riddle until the hoarse rasp of that once-familiar voice recalled it from Don Brink 's mirror . " Who are you ? " " The Defender . " Engineered for human smiles , for contact by sound as well as radio , he tried to ease the man 's half-hostile puzzlement . " Defender One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , the man emerged . Naked but burdened with a heavy backpack that looked like pliant brown leather . Blood from his navel was clotted and drying on his black-haired belly . Still gripping the birthcell 's lip , he frowned around him warily . At the soaring cliffs and the great waterfall roaring over them . At the wet red silt the flood had left on all the slopes toward the mud-yellow lake that still filled the lower canyon . At the little gravitic flyer sitting anchored to a higher ledge . His nose wrinkled at the reeking drift the flood had left , rotting stuff washed down from the thorn jungle upriver . " Where ? " The man 's troubled eyes came back to him . " What is this place ? " " You can speak , " he said . " Do n't you remember ? " " Remember ? " The man frowned and shook his head . His hair fell long , black and wet and glistening . " Remember what ? " " What we are . " " Words  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring off into the mist that billowed from below the waterfall . " A voice  --  a woman 's voice  --  saying I would wake up in Eden . " He goggled at the Defender . " Is this place Eden ? " " Not yet , " he said . " It can be a garden . Or whatever you make it . We 're on a planet named Mansphere . It will be your home . Your children 's home . A new home for mankind . " " I  --  I have no children . " " I hope you will have . "  | " How I ? " The man squinted again into the dark birthcell and swung back to challenge him . " I do n't remember much . Nothing I can understand . I want to know what you are and how we got here . " " That 's the seedship . " He gestured at the scarred hull behind them . " Launched from old Earth , when men were in trouble there . Carrying human genes and human culture in computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might reach . Damaged by a micrometeor in space and adrift a million years . But down safe at last , the retranslators working . " " Manseed ? " the man whispered . " I was  --  told about it . " He turned to frown at the flyer . " But that  --  what 's that thing ? " " An aircraft . Jet propelled , with lift from a gravity mirror . " " Gravity mirror ? " A blank headshake . " What 's that ? " " An effect created by using fusion power to invert the mass of common water . I do n't quite know how . " " Where ? " The man blinked . " It is not from old Earth . " " Something unexpected . We found robots here . They conquered the planet thirty thousand Terran years ago . Waiting since at their base for the creatures that built them . I got the machine from them . When I told them I was one of their builders . " " So they are friends ? " " Robots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a mystery . " " Then we 're in danger ? " " Could be . " He shrugged . " They know where we landed , but that site has been flooded . I moved us with the flier . If they come looking for us , they may decide we drowned . Perhaps they 'll never look . " " So ? " The man squinted over the high red cliffs into the empty sky . " What can we do ? " " Keep under cover . Carry on the plan to colonize Mansphere . All we can do . " He shrugged again . " The plan begins with you . The first man here . " Grinning , groping for the elation the occasion seemed to call for , he reached to clap the man 's muscular shoulder . " If this were Eden , you would be Adam . " " My name is Egan . " The man shrank from his reaching  | hand , eyes slitted to the sun and watchfully mistrustful . " I think you were first . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under that coldly searching stare , he spread his golden hands , dropped them to touch the clumsy cable he had rigged to his navel . " I 'm an  --  an artifact . " The word was hard to say . " More machine than human . Born of the ship the way you were but still really part of it . Call me its crew . Designed to maintain it and defend its mission . " " Defender ? Defender ? " Muttering that , the man scowled at his golden form , with a stabbing glance at the empty bareness where genitals might have been . " I begin to remember what the woman said you Defenders would be . " The curly black beard was still shining wet , strong with the reek of birth . Beneath it , the broad pink face turned grimmer . " Better than I am . Taller and stronger . Live statues of shining gold . Some of you winged . With senses and powers no man ever had . You never need to sleep or rest or even eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trying to disarm the man , he spoke about his nature and his limits . " I 'm running now on electric power . It comes through this . " He touched the umbilical . " From this battery pack I borrowed out of the flyer . Without it , I 'd stop . " " You might stop . " A sardonic accusation . " I 'd starve . " " You can grow food ? " " Or die . " The man 's fists knotted . " Unless I sweat to grow food out of the mud . The woman 's voice told me that . " " Surprised ? " Mildly , he appealed to reason . " Human beings have to ' eat . They always had to eat . From all I recall , you 'll enjoy it . You 'll find seed in your pack and food to last till you get your first harvest . Later , the ship can make other things you 'll need . The pack itself should come apart to make garments for you now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deluge had left . " Stinking mud . " " Soil . Rich enough  --  we 've analyzed it . The seed you have has been edited to thrive in it . Later , after your fellow human beings have all been born , the translators can be  | reprogramed to produce other types of Terran life . Cattle for milk and meat . Horses you can ride or harness ? " " Muck ! " The angry outburst cut him off . " I was made to sweat in the muck . You were made a god . Why ? Tell me why was n't I ? " Old Town in Albuquerque . They were eating that night at El Comanchero , down on San Filipe . Proposing the excursion , he had hoped to be alone with Megan , but Rablon somehow got himself and Wardian included . She was hard to get alone . " She exerts a force-field to hold us . " Wardian was wryly philosophical about her . " Like electrons around a nucleus . Or planets around a star . A bit rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for the project . It 's the tension that keeps us united and drives us ahead . " All except Rablon had margaritas . He ordered Scotch on the rocks  --  a prime antidote , he declared , to scanner sickness . One was not enough . The third let his ego show . " Gods ! We 're creating gods . " " Please , Marty . " Wardian touched his arm to warn him . " We are n't going public yet . " " They will be gods . " Rablon 's owlish scowl swept the tables around them as if to challenge any listener to doubt his miracles . " They have to be if we expect them to safeguard the seedships and create the seedling races . If we did n't make them supermen , they would n't have a chance . " He was Don Brink , still the new recruit , dazzled by Megan herself and the audacity of her dream but not yet at home with Rablon 's computer jargon and Ulver 's fusion physics and Tomislav 's promised wonders of genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to grope for the phrase . " I guess you would call them the children of the seedship ? " " Not so , Brink . " Rablon frowned as if offended by his ignorance . " The children of the seed will be human as I am . Born into a strange and maybe unfriendly environment , they 'll need help to get established . We 're engineering the Defenders to provide that help . " " Thanks . " Uncomfortably , he shrugged . " I did n't know . " " The Defenders are designed to be superiour because they have to be superior . " He wondered if Rablon saw  | himself that way . " They 'll require no food or air , and they 'll be immune to nearly everything . Sensitive to a wide radiation spectrum and able to operate on nearly any source of energy . Electric power , sunlight , even gamma radiation . Winged , if they need wings . We 're loading alternative programs to let the master computer adapt them to cope with whatever hazards they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do all that ? " He looked hard at Rablon , resenting his long black hair and his reedy stridence and his intellectual arrogance . " What are you doing for the human beings they 'll be defending ? " " All we can . They 'll be better men than you are . " Better than Rablon ? Wanting to ask , he swallowed the question . Megan was too clearly fond of him , too willing to forgive him everything . If he sometimes drank too much , that was because his wife had lately left him . If his talk sometimes got obnoxious , his genius was still essential to the project . " Better than homo sap . Not just clones , because we can pick and modify the best genes there are . Filter out the defects , at least those we can isolate . Improve intelligence and vigor and longevity . Limit animal aggressiveness , though we ca n't eliminate it . Not altogether . Even Tomislav admits we 'll have to keep enough for self-defense . " Rablon sat silent for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's afraid of you , Brink . Afraid we 'll have too many of our future people following in your peculiar footsteps . " Though Rablon probably did n't care , Tomislav had never forgiven Brink his career as a fighter for hire or even quite forgiven Megan for insisting that the Defenders might require a bit of his ability . When Brink looked at her now , her quick smile heartened him . Intense yet aloof , she seemed aware of all of them , fond of each one , but her devotion to the project always came first . Trying hard to tolerate Rablon because of all he felt for her , Brink could n't help another challenge . " Have you imagined how they 'll feel ? The children of the ship , when they meet the Defenders ? When they find they 're only human , knowing we could have made them godlike . " " But we ca n't . " Rablon was always too elaborately pa- tient about such points . " For a number of quite sufficient reasons . First of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see why . If you know how to grow them ? " " Inside the seedship . " The careful tone and the cold little smile put him down , as if he had been a backward child . " By retranslation from computer code into half-organic units . They 'll emerge full grown from the production chamber  --  as the first humans will . The humans will be complete ; we can record existing genes for the human reproductive system , pretty much as we find them . But , given the state of our technology and the risk of damage to the seed in space , it 's impractical as well as unnecessary to risk attempting to design functional reproductive systems for the Defenders . " " Eunuch gods ? " Watching Megan and watching them , Wardian had seemed discreetly amused at their clash , and he was trying to moderate it now . " Do you suppose they 'll be happy ? " " Happy ? " Rablon shrugged . " We 're engineering them as special service units . Programed to perform emergency functions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to offer another round of drinks . Wardian shook his head to check her , with a sharp glance at Rablon , and turned understandingly to him . " Don , there 're other reasons , too , why the people we plant will have to be human . Making Defenders will take special elements  --  the ship can carry feedstocks enough for only two or three . Human beings are made of more abundant stuff . Elements we ought to find anywhere . " And we hope the race will keep on evolving , adapting to each new environment , which means we must provide the best gene pool we can . The retranslators will be programed for at least forty individuals . Coming one by one off a production line inside the ship , a few weeks apart . " As I understand our plans ? " Urbanely modest , the tall astronaut looked at Rablon to wait for confirmation . " Twenty couples . " Rablon nodded , staring after the waitress as if he wanted to call her back . " With a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The owlish scowl returned to him . " Get it , Brink ? The Defenders could n't evolve . Even if  | we could somehow make them fertile , they 'd find themselves trapped in a genetic dead end . Their gene pool too small and too highly specialized . " " I ca n't argue with any of that . " He found a wry relief in Megan 's sympathetic glance . " But still , if I were one of those new humans , waking up on some new world to find that I might have been a sort of god " I would n't be terribly happy about it . " e wanted to help the man make tools . " You 've done your thing . " Without much grace , the man waved him away . " I 'll do my own , beginning now . " Born with knowledge and skills , the man searched for flints and flaked them into blades . Hewing driftwood , he made a wooden hoe and dug furrows for his seed . To irrigate his garden , he cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterfall . Though the monsoon season had ended , easterly winds still brought afternoon rain . When the first shower came , the man ignored it , working stolidly at the ditch until the Defender ran down to offer shelter in the flyer cockpit . " Thanks , Defender . " Stubborn faced , the man waved him back . " But the rules are what you made them a million years ago . The games 's mine to play . "  | He stooped again to his hoe . At last , however , with the icy drops pelting harder , he left his work and scrambled up the cliff into a shallow cave the river had cut in some past age . After the rain , with his ditch overflowing , he leveled the cave 's clay floor and carried rocks to begin a mudplastered wall . Pink at first , blistered and peeling , the man grew brown . Grew lean , eking out the scant rations from his backpack . Grew visibly harder , toiling through long days to keep his garden weeded , to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through those first few hard days , working with wary eyes on the sky , he repeatedly asked the Defender for more  | information about the robots . About the great dead starship that had brought them . About the disk-shaped thing ? weapon , power source , signal device , itself robotic  --  that had guided the Defender so near the robots ' ancient surface base , only to abandon him before he could enter . " Where is this base ? " " North , " he said . " Two thousand kilometers across a desert plateau . Then on beyond a canyon I could n't cross . " " A long way off . " A thoughtful scowl . " If they found us , what would they do ? " " Nothing , maybe . The disk-thing never told us much . We brought it with us off their starship . Knows a lot about us . Knows may be the wrong word  --  the thing 's a computer , loaded with control codes we 've never broken . " The robots did give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for feedstock . That 's all . Really all we know . I guess it 's possible they caught or maybe even killed our other Defenders . But we have n't detected any search for us . " " You think we 're safe ? " " I try to hope so , but they 're still a riddle . If they did n't accept me for one of their makers when I said I was , why did they give me the flyer ? If they did accept me , why do n't they give us more ? " In his own turn , the Defender stared past the rustcolored cliffs and out across the draining lake , toward the alien base . " No way to know . " Baffled , he shook his head . " If they 've been waiting thirty thousand years , I guess they 're willing to wait forever . " He nodded at the birthcell . " We 're waiting , too , for your first companion . " " A woman ? " The man grinned with the most emotion he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the plan . If the two of you agree . " He shrugged to cover a pang of envy . " If you do n't there 'll be others . The ship is to bear forty of you . Thirty days apart . " " I 'll be ready . " The man frowned at the ship , calculating . " Call me when her birth is near . " Getting ready , the man cut armloads of the grasslike stuff that grew higher on the bench , to make a bed . He brought the first food from his young garden : succulent lemon-colored stalks that he tried with evident relish and a few early tomato-red fruits . He gathered driftwood for fuel  | and sweated over a flint-carved fire-drill till blue smoke rose . The Defender built a fire of his own , to burn limestone for calcium the processors required for human bone . He pressed more oil from the nuts Defender Two had gathered before she was lost , hydrocarbon feedstock for retranslation into human tissue . All the last night , he waited on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him nothing , a glowing spot of infrared showed the kindling life within . Slight vibrations revealed its movement . Still he waited , till the night 's dim crimson faded slowly into dawn . " Defender ? " Coming down from the cave , the man paused to hail him . " Is it time ? " " Today . Later today . " " Call me . I want to be there . " Whistling , hoe on his shoulder , the man strode on . The mood was happy , the notes clear and true , a medley of tunes Wardian and Tomislav and the others had known and loved on the vanished Earth . A cheering sign , the Defender thought ; the children of the ship would soon be more than Stone Age savages . The lips of the birthcell were something other than ordinary metal , perhaps half organic , their gold film worn and scarred but free of rust . He felt their increasing warmth . Heard the thumps inside . A black crack split them , and he shouted for the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship but stopped on the way to fill both hands with red-ripe fruit . The slit widened faster than before . The birthscents poured out , powerful and strange  --  though the Defender caught a haunting trace of Megan 's lilac . The woman 's hand came out , and her pink wet arm , grasping blindly . He caught the hand , warm and small and strong . It closed on his . The pliant lips spread wider . Clinging to steady herself , she came out into his arms . Megan , bare . Except for the brown backpack For a single giddy instant , he was Don Brink again . Beside that motel pool , with the slick-haired manager escorting Megan to the table where he sat , bad leg propped up and aching from the guerrilla metal in his knee . Megan , his first dazzling glimpse .  | Recollections wrenched him . Her easy-striding vigor and the pleasant way she filled her trim business suit . Her dark hair glinting red in the sun . Her quick hand clasp when the manager introduced them . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming with the eager interest in him dawning in her eyes . The heady breath of lilac His instant lust came back . His burning perception of her ripely tempting readiness and his instant sense of latent passion in her , kindling his own hot urge to wake it . Lust and instant pain . Because he was too old for her , wounded and malarial , his life used up " Megan ? " Trembling , he whispered her name . " Megan ? " Because this newborn beauty was Megan Drake , here on Mansphere , alive again . The leanly vivid features , the redgold gleam of her dark dripping hair , and the bright-green glint of her eyes , now impishly daring . Yet he saw her quick headshake . " I was meant to be Megan . " The richly vibrant voice that he recalled , another wounding echo . " But if this place is Eden , my name will be Eve . " With summer ending , the dawn had been chill . He saw her shiver , shrinking from the wind . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth . Nude and breathless and odorous with lilac and all the overwhelming scents of her birth . He felt her nipples hardening , felt the sticky blood oozing hot from her navel . " Eve  --  please ! " He pushed at her wet flesh , too feebly . " We are n't for each other . If you are Eve , you must wait for your Adam ? " Her parted lips had found his mouth . " You 'll be my Adam . Because you 're Don . Dear Don Brink ! " Still clinging , she drew back a little to smile into his face . " Even golden , I still know you . Even here in Eden . God in Eden ! " Eyes closing , she pulled him passionately back . " I always loved you , Don . " She trembled , straining against him . " Loved you terribly . From when I first saw  | you at the place in Mexico . Though I know the old Megan never could tell you ? " " Defender ? " He felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathless accusation rasping at his ear . " You  --  you were to call me ! " The man had dropped the fruit he had brought for her . Bursting on the platform , it spattered blood-red juice . Muddy handed , the man was pale and breathing hard . His narrowed eyes swept them both , glazing with fury . " I did n't  --  did n't expect her so soon . " The Defender pulled her clinging arms away and swung her toward the man . " This is Egan , " he told her . " Egan Drake . " His voice quivered with emotion a Defender should n't feel , but he tried to grin at her . " If you are Eve , he 's to be your Adam . " Green eyes wide , she recoiled from the man . " He is n't Egan . " She shook her head , cringing . " Egan was my brother . " She swayed back against the Defender . " I do n't like him , Don . " Her voice quavered higher . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder into the man 's savage anger . " I  --  I 'm sorry . " His voice broke awkwardly . " But I did call when birth began . I never meant this ? " " Do n't lie ! I believe what I see . " She twisted her head to glare at the man . " You  --  you get away ! " Her lips had curled , and her tight voice lashed through half-shut teeth . " Stay away . Better stay away , because I  --  I hate you . I always will . Stinking animal ! Slobbering to rape me . Panting to drag me into your stinking cave . To make me your slave , grubbing in your stinking mud . I wo n't do it . " Sobs began to shake her . " I never  --  never will . " Without meaning to , the Defender found himself stroking her goose-pimpled flesh . " Bad luck . " He shook his head at the man , trying to seem more sympathetic than he felt . " We 'd planned for things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . But I hope you can forgive her ? " " Her ? Or you ? " " Both , I guess , " he muttered . " Though I never meant ? " " I can see what you meant . "  | " Remember  --  remember what we are . " He saw the man 's fists knotting . " Remember why we 're here  --  to replant the human race . If Eve is not for you , or you for her , others will be born ? " Not listening , the man plunged at them , fists wildly flailing . Stepping aside , the Defender swung the woman out of danger . A muddy foot slipped in the spattered fruit . The driftwood railing splintered . The man toppled off the platform . " Do n't ? " the woman sobbed . " Do n't let him have me . " He slid out of her arms and ran down the stair . The man had fallen half a dozen meters . Clutching at the posts beneath the stair , he was dragging himself painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched again , he glared up at the woman . " Stay safe ! " his harsh jeer rasped . " With your precious tin god . At least you know he 'll never rape you . " Spitting mud at the Defender , he blundered blindly toward his cave . t , gan , wait ! " he shouted after the man . " Listen to reason . We ca n't wreck the plan . Not after so many have given so much . Remember , other women will be born ? " The man stalked on . " Let him go . " With a helpless shrug , he turned back to Eve . She had followed him down the stair , and he felt her shivering arms slide around him .  | " I 'm sorry , Don , " she was whispering at his ear . " Terribly , terribly sorry ! Because I know what we were meant to be . Parents of the new mankind . I know I was meant for him  --  but I just ca n't ! Because I love you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient name came out in spite of him , and he turned to her sadly , shaking his head . " You ca n't love me ? " " But I do ? " " You ca n't love a  --  a thing . " His voice quivered and caught . " That 's all I am . A unit of the ship , though I do have bits of people in me . But if you think I 'm human ? " He pulled a little back and turned himself to let her see the umbilical cable and his naked sexlessness . " You see what I am . Why I ca n't love anybody . " " Don ? " A gasp of pain , but she did not recoil . " I 'm sorry for you . So awfully , awfully sorry ! For you but not for me . I do n't care . You 're still the one I love . " Trembling , she clung tighter . " I 'm sorry , too , for him . " She stared after the man .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates me now . Hates us both . I 'll never , never go to him . " Looking after the stalking man , he could only shrug again . " Don , I 'm so cold . " Her teeth chattered . " So terribly cold . " " You can stay on the flyer . And you have clothing in your pack . " They climbed into the cockpit and opened her backpack . A survival kit , produced by a separate assemblor system higher in the nose of the ship , its contents had been adapted to outfit her for Mansphere . A two-piece jumpsuit of soft leathery stuff . Light but sturdy-looking gloves and boots . A waterproof cloak , wide enough to be a blanket . Helping her dress , he ached inside because the trim tan suit made her more than ever Megan . One greenish eye closed slightly , in a way of Megan 's , as she frowned at a bag of little varicolored bricks . " Food , " he said . " Mostly concentrated proteins , to keep you alive till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed . " Another parcel , smaller . " Different kinds than Egan had . Engineered to suit the changing season  --  cooler weather , and dryer , with winter coming soon . Some of them for fiber you can make into warmer clothing . " The frown had bitten deeper , and he saw her troubled headshake . " You 'll need it , " he said . " Mansphere has a longer year than Earth . With its axis tipped forty degrees , the winter will be hard ? " " Oh , Don ! " He saw her tears . " I wish  --  I wish I were like you . So I could stay alive and we could be together . Together always ! Without such terrific problems . " Her desperate fingers caught his hand and clung . " We could be so wonderfully happy ? " " But you  --  you 're human . " His voice quivered . " I 'm not . We ca n't change what we are . " He drew her gently to him . " You 'll be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever be . Because you are human ? " " I do n't want to be . " " But you are . " Pulling away , he tried to be firm . " You must make some sort of peace with Egan ? " " I  --  I ca n't ! Because he has my brother 's name . Because I  | hate him . And I 'm afraid . I wo n't let him drag me into his cave . " " Maybe you should sleep here in the flyer , " he agreed . " But you and he will need each other . For winter , he 'll need seeds from your pack . Need your help to cultivate them and store food for winter . You 'll be hungry unless he shares what he 's growing now . " We must talk to him . " When she agreed , they left the flyer together . Another Megan Drake , slim and quick in the trim jumpsuit , pink skinned and tempting to him , her lilac scent still faintly clinging . Seeming younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked silently , gripping his fingers , trembling with dread . " I 'm starving ! " she decided suddenly , perhaps to delay the encounter . " Thirsty , too . " " Egan would n't like us raiding his garden . But here 's water enough . " They had come to the ditch . She frowned at him and then at the flowing water but dropped at last to drink . " So you think it 's so wonderful , being human ? " With a grimace of indignation , she brushed crumbs of soil off her hands . " Having to crawl in the mud like some animal just to stay alive ? " " I wish I were human . " Sadly , he glanced down at himself and back at her . " If I could change places with Egan ? " They crossed the ditch and climbed to the cave . The man 's birthscent lingered around it , staled now to a thin , sour reek . They stopped outside the crude rock wall , Megan huddled uneasily against him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No response . She was tugging at his arm , silently imploring him to leave , before the man stumbled from his cave . Still smeared with mud and blood from his fall off the platform , he looked shrunken , sick . " Get out . " His voice was raspy . " I 've had too much ? too much of both of you . " " Listen  --  however you feel , you and Eve need each other . She can sleep in the flyer , but to stay alive you 'll have to share . Seed . Work . Food ? " " I 'll make out . " He stooped for a rock . " As for the bitch  --  keep her out of my garden ! "  | The rock flew at Eve . The Defender stepped before her to catch it harmlessly . " Egan , please ! " He tossed the stone aside . " Remember what the project is . A million-year effort . Maybe the last chance mankind will ever have . Anywhere . We ca n't just waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late for that . " The man grinned bleakly through his red-clotted mask . " It was wasted back on Earth , when the scanner picked up too much of what mankind used to be . Or maybe out in space , when the micrometeor hit the ship 's computer and garbled all the programs . Too many malfunctions . We 're none of us what we should have been . Not even you . " A sardonic snort . " And you call yourself Defender ! " Reeling from the impact of that , he had to nod . " True , " he muttered . " True . I know we are n't perfect . Neither were our makers . They meant for us to build a better world than theirs . And still we can try  --  try to be what we should have been . To do what we were made for ? " " Defend her if you can ! " The ironic rasp cut him off . " But you are n't conning me . Any fool can see you were put together wrong  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her . I do n't need her or you . " " The ship does , " the Defender said . " Remember , there are others coming . " " They 'll need better robots . " The man squinted shrewdly through his matted beard . " Those others ca n't be as crazy ? as malfunctional as you are . I wonder if I could n't get in touch ? " " Do n't ! Do n't try that ? " " Take your bitch ! " The man scrabbled for more stones to throw . " Get away ! " " Let 's go ! " Eve tugged at his arm . " He 's the malfunctioning one . " She shrank behind him . " Sleep on it , " he begged the man . " Think things over . " " Here 's what I think . " They retreated from a volley of hard-thrown stones . The ship was calling before they reached it . It had closed the birthcell , and now it required more feedstocks . " We are n't stopped yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pinched , despairing face . " The ship 's still alive . Thirty days from now , another man should be born . I hope ? " His voice caught . " I hope he 'll be saner . " " Oh , Don ? " She blinked forlornly at him . " Do n't you see ? " Sobbing , shaking her head , she ran ahead of him toward the flyer . His kiln had cooled , so he opened it to refill the ship 's lime bin . He pressed oil nuts and filtered more oil into the hydrocarbon tanks . When he looked again for Eve , he found her on the muddy slope below the ditch the man had dug , bent over a driftwood stick she was using for a hoe , scraping out another garden . She straightened to wave at him with one muddy hand , two fingers spread in a V that sent a tiny shudder of recollection through him . Dusk fell , daylight fading into crimson infrared . He saw Eve limping back to the flyer , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lime enough and oil enough , he borrowed the flyer 's ballast hose , running it from the intake pumps down to the ditch . The retranslators and assemblers going again , he made a blade for Eve 's wooden hoe from a scrap of metal that had been the inspection plate over the limestone bin . For most of the night , he worked to prepare and plant the garden Eve had begun . Before dawn , his strength ran out , his battery charge exhausted . Plodding heavily back to the flyer , he slid off the backpack , set it to recharging , and hooked himself to the longer umbilical he had run to the flyer 's generator . Eve was uneasily asleep when he climbed into the cockpit . Megan still , younger and sadder than the Megan he recalled , hands blistered from the rough driftwood stick , dusty hair trailing across her childlike , tear-stained face . He heard her sob  --  and his power went off . Blacked out , he crumped to the deck . " Don ? " Her frightened gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " He could n't speak , could n't move , but he felt the flyer tilt . A red shadow in his fading vision , she floated above him and on to the cockpit door . It swung open . As the flyer tipped farther , he saw the dim-glowing ground , dropping fast beneath them . Heard water splashing and a shout of savage elation . He found the man , warmer and brighter  | than the ground , standing where the flyer had been , staring after them . One hand still clutching a loose anchor cable , the other clenched into a muddy fist . Chilled , the Defender understood . While he was at work , while Eve slept , the man had crept up to loosen the anchor cables , waited in hiding to unhook his power cord and drain the ballast tanks . In the grasp of the gravity mirror , they were falling into the sky . For a moment , he was n't much alarmed . The flyer had been engineered for safety . He saw the emergency lever flashing red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restore their balance . He tried to point , tried to shout . His numb hand refused to move . He found no voice . Yet somehow Eve understood . He saw her hauling at the lever , but still they floated upward . He knew then that the man had somehow disabled the emergency system . They were already many meters high , flying off the planet . He would probably survive . In space , the sun would soon revive him enough to let him recouple his umbilical to the generator . He could repair the controls , vent massinverted water to balance the lost ballast , restart the rocket engines , probably find his way back . But Eve Rising from the planet 's night side , they would be above the atmosphere before they met the sun . Sick with helpless pity , he saw her faint red shape in motion again . She pulled him to the tilted door . Clinging desperately , she jumped with him . They spun down toward the canyon floor . A blood-red glow , it had sunk too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy . The doll-sized man staring up at them , shaking a furious fist . He ached inside . They were too high . Too high for her ? A fine fall Friday  --  and Megan alone ! The lab was shut down for the weekend , with Rablon away to read a paper at some computer symposium , Wardian and Ulver in conference with the Solar Sail engineers who still hoped to launch their flight to Mars , and Tomislav back in La Jolla at his wife 's bedside . He bought cold cuts and French bread and two bottles of a mild Chablis he thought she would like . She filled the picnic basket and drove them out through Tijeras Canyon and north off the interstate toward the Sandia summit . The cedar-scented air grew cooler . Happy with her , he liked her slight lilac scent and her skill at the wheel and just being with her .  | Still ambivalent about his profession , she wanted to know about Kenya and the animals he had n't even wanted to hunt and the poachers he had been hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish eyes flashed keenly at him . " Killing men to defend the elephants ? " " A game  --  the game I love . " He nodded . " The poachers had been warned to quit . Got their own message back , for us to go to hell . Armed like commandos and trying hard to get us first . " In spite of himself , he grinned at her uneasy fascination . " The elephants ca n't hold out forever , but at least I gave a few of them a breather . " With a wry half smile , she drove on silently . " Egan , " he prompted her at last . " Your twin . You 've never told me much about him . " " I 've never told anybody . Not even Ben Bannerjee . " Her  | voice had fallen oddly , and she kept her eyes on the road . " But if you really  --  really like me , I suppose you ought to know . " " Like ? " he whispered . " The word is love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed broodingly unhappy when she glanced at him . " It may change when you know . " She had turned off the crest highway into a narrower , less-used road that climbed through taller timber toward the crest . Turning again , she stopped outside a wide gate of welded iron pipe , secured with a chain and a rusty padlock . She gave him a key . He had left his cane behind . Trying to seem younger than he was and not to show the twinges in his knee , he hurried to open the creaking gate and wave her through . The forest road beyond was overgrown with brush . It climbed again , until suddenly they were on the mile-high rim , with cliffs falling sheer to the smoggy city and the endless strip of river-watered green winding down the arid valley and the brown mesas rolling off beyond it toward remote blue ranges that bit into the bluer , unpolluted sky . " Big ! " he whispered . " Big as the Kenya highlands . " She stopped a dozen meters from the brink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat for a time in the car . Except for the wind , he heard no sound . Here above everything , sharing a feeling that all human concerns were overwhelmed by that awesome natural immensity , he felt nearer her than he had ever been . Turning at last to face her , he waited to learn why they were here . " You asked about Egan . " Solemn eyed , she paused to study him before she went on . " This land was his . He wanted to build a telescope here . Really ! " She had seen his astonishment . " I think I told you he had big ideas  --  most of them a little crazy . We were barely twenty-one the year he bought it with his share of our mother 's estate . He 'd been a brilliant student in several fields before Ben steered him into astronomy  --  Ben worried about him as much as I did . He was eager about it at first because he had this idea for a new sort of telescope . " An obsession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would probably never work . A multiple instrument . Two dozen scopes , in fact , spaced along a Y like the radio dishes in the Very Large Array down out of Socorro.  | Each one only moderately large but all of them focused on electronic image intensifiers , feeding into a computer that would combine them . He hoped to get the definition of a mirror three kilometers across . Able to see the planets of stars hundreds of light-years off . " " Why would n't it work ? " " Perhaps it would . " Her voice seemed sadly wistful . " Though Ben was seldom wrong . Egan never got far enough to run any tests . Actually , this was n't a good location . Maybe high enough but too much night glare from Albuquerque . There were financial problems and scientific problems . All too much for him . " She sighed . " He always got some new enthusiasm before he finished what he started . That fall , it was the wife of a tenor at the Santa Fe opera . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She  --  and finally her attorneys  --  got what was left of his legacy . So he had no funds for the telescope . " He saw the pinch of old pain on her face . " It was two years later he died , climbing another mountain he 'd been warned about . The seedship project was his last big idea . The biggest . Everybody but Ben thought it was the craziest . " A painful little smile touched her face and vanished . " Egan left the land to me . With a letter in his bank box saying how much he loved me and begging me to forget ? " Her voice caught , and he waited for her to go on . " I never sold the land because it 's all I have of Egan . " She turned to look back into the tall evergreens . " We saw it first the year we were sixteen , long before he owned it . He was still into anthropology then , and we were dividing the summer between Uncle Luther 's ranch and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wind and the sun . The long hot days in the pit , sifting dust . Even the sweat and the bugs , because I 'd got caught up in the mystery and the tragedy of the Anasazi . Egan worked beside me . Never saying much , but I knew he was terribly unhappy . He had been sad for years , though he would n't tell my why . " She was staring away again , at the remote horizon and the empty sky , as if only half aware of him . " We 'd grown up too close  --  maybe I told you . "
