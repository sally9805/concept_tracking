While much of the world is starving , most Americans are eating too much : Obesity is the American brand of malnutrition . And would you believe  --  despite our compulsive fixation on dieting and exercising to lose weight the average weight of American adults has continued to increase ? In 1980 , the typical American was 10 to 20 pounds above the " ideal " weight . This amount of excess weight is more of a social problem than a medical disease . Though anything beyond 25 percent above the " ideal " is likely to be harmful , most of us who are 10 to 20 pounds overweight are not endangering our health  --  from the weight itself . If the excess weight is accompanied by high blood cholesterol , hypertension or diabetes , then it is a problem . However , by itself , a little bit of excess weight is not harmful . To keep matters straight , let 's use these definitions : Overweight is anything from 1 percent to 19 percent more than the desirable weight ; obesity is more than 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deciding what is the normal weight , the best indicator of body weight is the " body-mass index " ( BMI ) , which is derived by dividing the weight by the square of the height . Place a ruler across your weight and height ( using either the metric or avoirdupois measures ) and determine your BMI . If you are above 25 , you are overweight ; about 30 and you 're obese . We will mainly consider those who are truly obese , because they make up a sizable number of people , and they are at increased risk of heart disease . " Morbid " Obesity When obesity becomes severe  --  or , as it is aptly termed , " morbid " ? death and debilitating diseases such as coronary artery disease , hypertension and diabetes occur at very high rates . This degree of obesity is usually defined as more than 50 percent above average weight . In one study of 200 such morbidly obese men in Los Angeles , Dr. E.J. Drenick and his coworkers observed that the death rate was 12 times above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times above average for 45- to 54-year-old men . Their deaths were mostly from cardiovascular disease . Since they died at such an early age , fewer lived long enough to develop cancer . There are about one million of these morbidly obese people in the United States . Their very high risk for serious trouble has led to such drastic treatments as intestinal bypass operations and prolonged periods of total starvation . " Moderate " Obesity At least three of the clearly defined risk factors for preventable heart disease frequently accompany moderate obesity ( 20 percent to 40 percent overweight ) ? elevated blood cholesterol , hypertension and diabetes . Among the obese people in one study , not only did the total cholesterol levels tend to be high , but there were lower levels of the " good " type of cholesterol , the high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) form , which is believed to protect against atherosclerosis . Fortunately , when these people lose weight , the levels of HDL cholesterol usually rise , which is probably responsible for some of the lowering of cardiovascular risk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common among people who are 20 percent or more above normal weight . Hypertension does n't develop in every obese person , but there is a general relation : The greater the weight gain , the higher the blood pressure . How this happens is unknown , though there appears to be a retention of extra sodium , possibly related to some of the hormonal abnormalities that accompany weight gain . Sodium retention may be the primary disturbance behind most hypertension , so the connection between weight gain and blood pressure is a logical one . Those who are fat will usually have a fall in blood pressure if they lose weight , and this should be the first treatment attempted for hypertension . More important , the prevention of obesity may prevent the development of hypertension . In a study of high school students in Pittsburgh , those teen-age boys who gained the most weight tended to have the highest blood pressures . The last of the three probable mechanisms for the greater risk of cardiovascular disease is the frequent association of obesity and diabetes , which almost always accelerates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obese people have other disturbances in the way they handle sugar  --  abnormal glucose tolerance ? which may provoke cardiovascu- 20 lar trouble . " Minimal " Obesity We 've seen that obesity is frequently accompanied by major risk factors for heart disease and that the relief of obesity may help relieve these risks . But do the " minimally " obese ( body weight 10 percent to 20 percent above normal ) have increased risk even if they do n't have accompanying high cholesterol , hypertension or diabetes ? The answer that most would likely give is yes . Statements such as " obesity is the number-one health problem today " continue to appear in medical journals and are probably responsible for part of our national obsession with obesity . But recent evidence has tended to deny that the excess 10 to 20 , or even 30 , pounds many of us are carrying is detrimental to our physical health . As clearly delineated by one of the leading authorities about the risks of obesity , Dr. Ancel Keys , we have been misled into thinking that minimal obesity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first source of confusion relates to what we have been using as our standard for " normal " or " ideal " or " desirable " weight : The Metropolitan Life Insurance Table of Desirable Weights for Men and Women . According to the findings incorporated in this table , the top " desirable " weight for a 6-foot man of medium frame is 170 pounds . According to the body-mass index , that weight is well below the 30 figure that is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease . The discrepancy results from the basis for the widely used Metropolitan Table : The weights are based on a group of applicants for life insurance who were in their mid-20s . These applicants obviously were not representative of the entire normal population and certainly should n't be used as the standard for people in // their 40s , 50s and 60s . Another source of confusion has been attacked by Dr. Keys : the division into " small , " " medium " and " large " frames . He points out that these presumed frame sizes were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range in weights seen among healthy people in their mid-20s . In fact , the average height of American men aged 40 to 59 years is about 15 percent above the " desirable " weight figure for men of " average frame . " The question then arises  --  are the majority of us at an increased risk ? According to Dr. Keys , " The idea has been greatly oversold that the risk of dying prematurely or of having a heart attack is directly related to the relative body weight . For middle-aged men , the best prospect for avoiding death in 10 or 15 years is to be about average , or a bit over , in relative weight . The risk rises somewhat with departure in either direction from the happy middle April ' 83 ground , but risk increases substantially only at the extremes of under-and overweight . " The information now available is n't adequate to say much about younger men or women , though they seem to be much like the middle-aged men , with no evidence of any increased risk for the majority whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be emphasized : There are also greater risks for those who are 15 to 20 percent below average weight . Though it used to be said that " one could never be too rich or too thin , " the truth is that too thin is harmful . In one study , death rates were definitely higher in men and women whose relative weight was 10 percent or more below the average . Thus , the curve for weight as it relates to death rates is not a straight line that goes progressively up with increasing weight . Rather , it is a gently sloping U-curve , with increasing trouble for those who are too thin ( more than 10 percent below average ) and those who are too fat ( more than 20 percent above average ) . Even if they do not have physical dysfunction or greater mortality , those who are minimally overweight do carry a handicap . As stated by Dr. Faith T. Fitzgerald , " It is clear from reading magazines or watching television that public derision and condemnation of fat people is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against any group based solely on appearance . Personality profiles of obese adolescent girls show that they respond very like oppressed minorities in their acceptance of dominant values in the culture and their passive withdrawal . It has been documented that all of us  --  the general public , social workers , employers , graduate-schools admissions officers , nurses and physicians  --  feel negatively have a ponderostat or appestat , a device that regulates appetite like a thermostat , causing us to eat until a certain amount of body fat is present and then shutting off the appetite . A few people become fat after brain damage that affects an area , the hypothalamus , where appetite seems to be controlled . But for most who are obese , there is no evidence of such an abnormality . It is true that most of us cut down on our food intake if we are given a high-calorie snack immediately before a meal , while some fat people go ahead and eat just as much . Similarly , when lean men were purposely stuffed for long periods , their weights rose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights fell back to initial levels . There may , however , be a time when overfeeding leads to permanent obesity . This was first demonstrated in experiments on rodents by Drs . Jules Hirsch , Jerome Knittle and coworkers at Rockefeller University . They took groups of newborn rats who were littermates and placed half of these in groups of four to a nursing mother , the otherhalf of them in groups of 22 to one mother . Those in the overfed first group not only gained more weight while being nursed , but continued to become fatter after weaning as well . When the experimenters counted the number of fat cells in the two groups of rats , they found three times more fat cells in those overfed as infants , despite the fact that they must have started life with the same number as their underfed brothers and sisters . After this report , studies on humans showed the same phenomenon : Children or adults with lifelong obesity have increased numbers of fat cells . Those who become obese in adult life tend only to have larger fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for developing increased numbers of fat cells by overfeeding seem to be the first year of life and then again around age 10 . Presumably , once these fat cells appear , they never disappear , so the person is more likely to gain weight and to have trouble in losing it . Not all fat babies turn into fat adults and most fat adults were not fat babies . But keeping babies from getting fat seems eminently sensible : It may prevent some of our lifelong troubles . Fat parents could have fat babies because they overfeed them from infancy on . But another possibility is that fat parents also may be passing on genes which cause their children to become obese . Other than for a few very rare diseases , there really is no evidence for a genetic inheritance . A shared environment is the most likely cause of similar weight patterns seen among family members . A number of fascinating studies have investigated what turns appetite off and on in nonobese and obese people . As an example , a few people in each category were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , and as much as they wanted , by sucking a liquid concoction out of a container . The nonobese subjects , despite the situation , continued to consume about the same number of calories . But the obese people , despite having started at a higher level of caloric intake , immediately cut their consumption . When the circumstances were unattractive , they reduced their caloric intake markedly . This study , along with a number of others , suggests that obese people often eat in response to external circumstances rather than from internal stimuli . When the surroundings are attractive , they eat even if not driven by some hunger sensation . When the external cues  --  a cozy place , friends and family around , the TV set on  --  are gone , they reduce their eating . Too Few Calories Going Out Although those who are markedly overweight almost certainly overeat , the cause of much of our middle-age spread is a decreased expenditure of calories . As we grow older , we slow down in various ways  --  less dancing , less walking , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding the pavement as a salesman . Such subtle differences in physical activity may be responsible for more obesity than we assume . The amount of walking done in a week 's time by groups of obese women was compared to thatdone by a group of normal-weight women whose life situations were similar . In one week 's time , the normal-weight women walked 34 miles . In the same time , while doing apparently the same amount of housework , shopping and other tasks , the obese women walked an average of 20 miles . If a mile of walking is worth 100 calories , the obese women would have burned 1,400 fewer calories , enough for almost one-half pound of fat . That 's almost 25 pounds in a year , far more than most gain even under the worst circumstances . It is certainly possible that these obese people were less physically active because they were obese  --  it takes more energy to move when you 're carrying an extra 50 pounds . It may be that those of us who are more efficient , who waste fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become obese . The obese may not just be outwardly more efficient ; they may also have more efficient metabolic machinery within their bodies , burning fewer calories to keep warm , to exercise and to runthe body processes . There are some bits of evidence suggesting various differences in the metabolic efficiency of the obese , but taken together , they are rather unconvincing . One obvious difference may be involved : Many calories are burned to make heat to keep our body temperature at 98 ? F. when the environment is 72 ? F. or colder . Fat is a great insulator , and as more fat is deposited , we need to burn fewer calories to keep our temperatures higher than the outside . The Treatment of Obesity For most persons wanting to lose weight , the problems of both calorie intake and calorie expenditure must be attacked . The verb attacked came to me quite naturally . But an " attack " upon your obesity is not what we 're really after . That connotes a massive force that is used to achieve a goal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what most of us have been doing  --  be it Atkins , Stillman , grapefruit , Mayo or Beverly Hills . Guidelines for Successful Weight Loss I. Set sensible short-term goals for yourself . If you 're 75 pounds overweight , the idea of shedding all of that in a short period of time is so overwhelming that most people give up in desperation . Go after 5 or 10 pounds at a time and feel good when you 've managed that . 2 . Recognize that the tendency to be overweight is an incurable but controllable condition , in many ways like hypertension . You 've got to establish a new set of eating habits . 3 . Go slow and be thankful for small blessings . It does n't seem you 're accomplishing much if you lose 1 pound a week , but remember , that 's 52 pounds in a year ! Since it took you 5 or maybe 10 years to gain that much , try to accept a gradual but steady weight loss as a reasonable goal . 4 . Weigh in only once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . If you accomplish your short-term goal , reward yourself with a nonfattening treat . You may want to go on a " maintenance " diet for a few weeks before taking on another 5 to 10 pounds , or you may be so flushed by victory as to want to go right on . 5 . Use various techniques to modify your eating behavior : Prepare only enough food for the meal ; put the food on the plate ( a small one ) without having extra portions at the table ; eat without distractions , never in front of the TV set ; eat slowly ; realize that it is not a sin to leave food on your plate  --  the starving Armenians will not find out . 6 . If your willpower fails and you give in to temptation , try to be satisfied with the first few bites of " forbidden " foods . And when you do give in , recognize that you 're only human . Falling off the wagon temporarily need n't mean that you have to lose the whole wagon and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and always have low-calorie snacks available . You never know when the urge will strike , and you must be ready with carrots , cauliflower or other ammunition . 8 . Do n't look for magic from pills or spas . They may provide temporary help , but it still gets down to cutting calories  --  roughly 500 a day less than what you burn in order to lose a pound a week , since there are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat . 9 . Exercise as much as you can , starting slowly and gradually building up your capacity . Be sensible about the form of exercise you perform . Few people will stick with jogging a mile every day . But everyone can walk an extra mile a day , particularly if it 's six blocks to the office or shopping center . Make this part of your regular routine and not a time-consuming extra effort that quickly becomes such a burden that you quit . A mile of brisk walking a day burns about 90 calories , enough to shed 7 pounds in a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several calories each . Lower-calorie beer and wine are available . Nevertheless , a six-pack of lite beer is still almost 600 calories . You need to reduce your caloric intake below your caloric expenditure by 500 calories per day to lose 3,500 calories or one pound of fat a week . To lose two pounds of weight per week , a daily deficit of 1,000 calories is needed . That should be accomplished by a combination of decreased intake by a diet and , to a lesser degree , increased expenditure by exercise . There are many sources of complete diet programs , but you really may not need to do much more than cut out some high-calorie sweets , desserts , breads and dressings and substitute lower-calorie foods for very caloric ones . Obesity is common , and we 've not been very successful up to this point in overcoming it . Despite spending more than $10 billion a year on weight-losing methods and ideas , millions of Americans continue on their seemingly hopeless quest for a size-six figure or a 34-inch waist . Much more likely to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be altered to provide adequate nutrition without increasing the child 's risk for later obesity or hypertensions . The renewed interest in breast-feeding is a good sign . In Stanford , California , children in the fourth and fifth grades of school were given an effective instructional program and altered their own eating behavior , increased their level of physical activity and influenced their family 's eating patterns as well . If we can reach parents and children early enough , healthy eating habits should be easy to adopt and easier to maintain .
