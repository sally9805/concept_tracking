To judge from Mrs. Lambert ' s essay in the catalogue for the show , personal and corporate vanity has played a negligible part in the acquisition of art . Still , she insists , a collection , whatever its contents , must " have a purpose , a point of view defined by the scientist , scholar , historian or curator responsible for forming it . " As inferred from its permanent and temporary installations , Seagram ' s purpose , like those of many corporate collectors , is that its employees learn while they earn , and that the public also partake of its cultural riches , although in the case of its gallery , only on working days between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. // The point of view , presumably , varies according to the work under consideration which , in the case of this show , a two-part event , is of ideas for Conceptual and Minimal sculpture dating from the 1960 ' s to the 1980 ' s . Seagram ' s curatorial consultant , David Bellman , says in his catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning by detaching itself from allusion and illusion . " That definition , while as sleek and as enigmatic as the work it introduces , is nonetheless arguable . Can art ever do more than aspire to such detachment and , if it can , what meaning would it have that would be communicable ? No matter , the audience is not supposed to reason why , even though art is hellbent on its enlightenment. // Not intended as finished works , the drawings are supposed to give insight into the making of the sculpture , thus , the show ' s press release says , bringing " immediacy to the creative process . " Well , some do , if accompanied by a photograph of the completed project , but most do not . Nancy Holt ' s " Study for Sun Tunnels " falls into the the installation and its foundation , situated in Utah ' s Great Basin Desert and including compass points and three lines of vision . A captioned photograph explains that the tunnels are four concrete cylinders , each 18 feet long and 8 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast and southwest , and they are aligned with the angles of the sun as it sets and rises at the winter and summer solstices and are pierced with holes corresponding to certain astronomical constellations . The sun shines through the holes , creating varying patterns of circles and ellipses. // Less intelligible are Robert Grosvenor ' s two right angles defined by masking tape and steel tape on white paper . Titled " Study for 2 Broken Off at Ground Level , " the idea was evidently never realized as an environmental piece . Similarly uncommunicative is the bold pencil outline of a fan shape , even though its touch is immediately recognizable as Ellsworth Kelly ' s and it comes with a photograph of the standing Corten sculpture it denotes. // Several drawings , though no less cryptic , are relatively picturesque items in their own right . For example , there is Robert Smithson ' s " Study for a Project for an Open Pit With Lake , " which depicts a circle with four arcing spokes and is laid on a ground briskly hatched with pencil strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite playful pen-and-ink notation about circles in a square . It is the preliminary to a horizontal sheet of latex bearing several small balls of the same material with slits in them . Geometric but decorative are Brenda Miller ' s schemes in pencil and colored pencil for , respectively , " Collapsed Grid " and " Half-Rectangular Unsolid . " So is Mel Bochner ' s " Study for Principles of Detachment . " This is composed of two triangular sections of a grid numbered in red chalk and marked at its intersections with blobs of black. // But for the most part , the show is less esthetically interesting than a diagram of , say , a computer ' s innards . Still , this is to be expected , considering that the Conceptual and Minimal movements were in their own way rebellions against art , even if their members , often wearing the hats of engineers , architects or scientists , retained the right to creative arbitrariness . Now that it has been thoroughly museumized , such work seems to presuppose an audience ill at ease with spontaneity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Feb. 10 , except for Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 . Part II opens Feb. 20. ) // // // Also of interest this week : <> <> Jorge Tacla ( Haime , 1000 Madison Avenue at 78th Street ) : The young Chilean painter Jorge Tacla is , like many other South American artists , fascinated by the human potential for cruelty . Most of his drawings , done in pencil line and patches of color , are of small male figures experiencing pain ( a knife through the skull , for instance ) or metamorphosis ( a nose turning into a long snout ) . // Less sadistic but more obscure are canvases such as " Sunset With Acid , " in which a hermaphroditic elephant with two human faces painted on its belly - one with tusks - is poised in the air between two trees . It refers to an African rite for disemboweling elephants . The huge head of a cocaine dealer , schematically painted in pink on black , indicates that Tacla can be topical as well as anthropological . But immersed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to go before reaching high ground as a painter . ( Through tomorrow , then Jan. 7 through 12. ) // // <> <> Rufino Tamayo ( Mary-Anne Martin Fine Art , 213 East 49th Street ) : Small though it is , this exhibition sheds light on the development of Rufino Tamayo . In his own way , the artist is as much the personification of Mexico as Diego Rivera , Jose Orozco and David Siqueiros , yet he has been overshadowed by them - some say for political reasons. // Tamayo was born in 1899 , three years after Siqueiros , the youngest of the " big three , " and his art has been to a great extent a reaction against their Social Realism . Pre-Columbian art , a collection of which he presented to Mexico a decade ago , has been a major inspiration to him , but not to the exclusion of European Modernism , especially not in his mature work . In fact , it is visible here as early as 1937 in a painting , replete with Braqueian mannerisms , of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in a later scene of an ice cream parlor with two figures. // After producing a head of a man smoking , a quite beautiful work bearing the imprint of African sculpture , Tamayo falls under the spell of Picasso in his Surrealist phase . First , there are compositions in murky tones of grotesque figures and animals , then , in clearer colors of a higher key comes the even more Picassoid " Man on the Telephone , " of 1956 . The sandy , fussed-over surfaces of the artist ' s mature phase begin here with " Tauro " of 1962 , and become progressively more mannered as the color grows sweeter and the inavriably figural subject matter more obscure . Of course , deference to the school of Paris doesn ' t in itself place Tamayo below the creative salt - his Social Realist confr eres drank at the Modernist fountain , too - but the way in which he has used its ideas marks him as an artist more concerned with appearances than either form or content . ( Jan. 2 through 31. ) // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison Avenue at 70th Street ) : There is frequently an ominous tone to Michael Mazur ' s landscapes , - very marked in the large charcoal drawing of a grove of trees and in the painting of a vine that has slipped its moorings in a tree - less so in the other oils and the pastels . A skillful pastelist , the artist defines houses and the trees around them with black lines , fleshing in their forms with fluffy masses of glowing color . But as a painter who is partly Realist , partly Expressionist , he is less effective , being inclined to use too many colors . " Painting at Wakeby , " however , arrests the eye with a visual pun : It seems to be a view of a lake divided - as if with intent to Cubism - into three sections , but is in fact a Magrittean trick . The center section , occupied mainly by the lake , is a painting of a painting on an easel . ( Through Jan. 19 ; closed Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. ) // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene Street ) : Russ Warren has created what must be called , for want of a less hackneyed term , " a world of his own . " Expressed in tight , crisscross brush strokes , the world ' s landscape and vegetation seem made of a machined substance , likewise its inhabitants , even though they are engaged in human activities . An example of the latter is " Hurricane , " where two nude swimmers are about to be engulfed by a huge blue wave that has as many teeth as " Jaws . " A note of social comment is struck in " Politician , " a scene of two men. who are barefoot but otherwise dressed as frontier characters , are about to shake hands over two other , apparently dead figures . Painted in red and yellow , respectively , the same corpses are being trampled by a pink horseman in " The Defeated South . " There is a worrisome sense of mass production in Warren ' s work that is heightened by lurid color and a consistent oiliness of surface . Yet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as they are called , make a strong and lasting impact . ( Through Jan. 9 , except Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. ) // //
