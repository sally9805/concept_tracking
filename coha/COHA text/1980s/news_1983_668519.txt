The battle over condominium conversions resumes in the state Senate this week , with tenants and the real estate industry still at loggerheads over how best to regulate development . After languishing in the upper chamber for three months , a bill supported by developers and denounced by tenants is expected to emerge for debate tomorrow . The confrontation will test Gov . Michael S. Dukakis ' skills as a lobbyist as well as those of the competing interests . Dukakis objects to the pending bill because it establishes a statewide standard for conversion rather than allowing the state ' s 351 cities and towns to adopt controls tailored to local circumstances . " I don ' t think there is any question Mike wants to see a home rule provision in the bill that reaches his desk , " said Richard E. Kendall , the governor ' s legislative director . " If he ' ll only sign a home rule bill , that ' s off the wall , " replied Sen. Joseph F. Timilty ( D-Canton ) , cochairman of the joint Committee on Housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to spur action on the bill before the Legislature recesses for the summer , the governor has invited Timilty to his office today to discuss their differences . Attempts by Timilty , Secretary of Communities and Development Amy S. Anthony and others to find a compromise collapsed in mid-June when the Massachusetts Tenants Organization decided the real estate industry was , in the words of organization director John McDonough , " trying to run the clock out on us . " Before those talks broke down , however , the industry agreed to several changes in the bill , which Timilty said he will offer this week as amendmentsfrom the floor . The pending bill would require landlords to offer tenants the firstpurchase option on their apartments , to provide one year ' s notice before conversion - two years if the tenant is elderly or handicapped - plus relocation benefits and assistance in finding a new apartment . Failure to find comparably priced housing in the same community could delay conversion for low and moderate income tenants , the elderly and the handicapped for as long as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not exceed 10 percent . In repsonse to the Massachusetts Tenants Organization ' s objections , Timilty said , the real estate industry has agreed to exempt Boston , Cambridge , Somerville , Brookline and Acton . Those communities now have ordinances regulating condominium conversions that set a tougher standard than that spelled out in the legislation . In addition , the bill ' s proponents agreed to delete a provision exempting housing built after 1969 and to include a section setting penalties for violators . What the sponsors refused to insert were provisions to limit rent increases imposed during the period between purchase of an apartment building and declaration of intent to convert and to establish a permit system that would allow municipalities to control the pace of conversions . " Timilty would like people to believe those changes make the bill more acceptable but they don ' t , " said Sen. George Bachrach ( D- Watertown ) , who will try tomorrow to convince his colleagues to substitute a home rule bill for the pending legislation . Ironically , just such a home rule bill won overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hours of the session by former governor Edward J. King . With a more receptive governor in the corner office , that support is waffling . " One of the reasons it passed so easily last year was that everyone knew what King would do with it at the last minute . It was a no-risk vote , " said McDonough . " The real estate industry is smart . This year they knew they couldn ' t fight us with nothing so they came up with a bill that is supposed to be a compromise and convince legislators we ' re radicals . " The immediate fate of condominium regulation could be decided , according to Bachrach , by political manueuvering rather than parliamentary debate . " This is going to be a mess , " he said . " Either susbstitution will prevail or the industry bill will be on calendar every day through the fall . There will amendment after amendment . It ' s going to be an extended debate .
