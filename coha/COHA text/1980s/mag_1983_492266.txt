The telegram from Aunt Rose in Chicago was simple and direct : Uncle Steve had died . On the plane from New York to attend the funeral , I kept thinking of Uncle Steve with a deep sense of sadness . By the world 's standards , he was a failure , someone to be pitied or scorned . And I found myself wondering what the real significance of his life was  --  if there was any at all . One thing was certain : He had been an important part of my life when I was a young boy . He was one of the 16 brothers and sisters who were born to Grandfather Donohue , a fierce , bearded farmer from County Cork , Ireland , and Bridget Scanlon , a meek country girl who came to America and set up housekeeping amid the cabbage patches , flower gardens and saloons in the Back-of-the-Yards section of Chicago 's South Side . The boys of the family were high-spirited , independent , argumentative , popular , wild and unruly . The girls were the same but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think all of her family were born in the wrong century . None of them had any luck driving automobiles , using telephonzs or even opening packages according to printed instructions . Cans of food were often as not opened upside down , and cereal boxes , imprinted with phrases like " Cut along dotted line " or " Open here , " were instead opened as if by the paw of a grizzly bear  --  and an angry one at that . Even the ringing of a doorbell could throw the Donohues into a panic . Instead of answering the door calmly , in a civilized way , the members of the family would start up like a flock of startled quail , some running into bedrooms , others hiding behind cur- " tains and peeking out of windows to see what enemy was invading their privacy . Mother 's own adventures began as an aerial acrobat with the old Barnum and Bailey troupe . Within a few years she was a chorus girl and eventually a comedienne , working for many years with a succession of vaudeville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , married her and fathered me . But he died when I was a baby , and from that time I was surrounded almost exclusively by women . I say almost , because there was one man in the house : Uncle Steve . Uncle Steve Donohue . Steve was what you would call a confirmed bachelor . Big and manly , he looked like a stevedore or a truck driver . He always wore secondhand dark blue suits and a rough-looking gray cap . He hardly ever wore a tic , and his shirts were the sort worn by railroad men . He drank hard and July/Aug. ' 83 got into fistfights at the drop of a hat . When he was young I presume he fought because he was almost certain to win , but as he got older he used to come home obviously the loser of these saloon altercations , his shirts sometimes encrusted with blood and his face and lips cut and swollen . He did n't have enough sense to stop picking fights with other , younger men . Steve was virile , fearless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was unsophisticated , old-fashioned , out of context with his time . Perhaps these traits were a result of his social environment , because the South Side of Chicago in the early years of the twentieth century was a rough , brawling place to grow up in , with plenty of saloons and pool halls , but no playgrounds , libraries or young people 's dances . But then , millions of others grew up in that same environment , and they did n't all turn out to be hard-drinking saloon fighters . Like a lot of the Irish who grew up in the Back-of-the-Yards , Uncle Steve had never had an opportunity to be trained in any particular trade . He used to talk a lot about railroads ; he worked at odd times for different lines . When he traveled , it was always on freight trains . I think he fancied himself a railroad man , although probably he had not worked long at any particular railroad job . But he used to dress like a railroad man and roll his own cigarettes with Bull Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep marbles in ) . In his back pocket he always carried a large , dark blue handkerchief with white dots on it . Aunt Mag said he looked like Gary Cooper when he was younger . I never thought that , but he had the same tall , lean open-airness about him . He used to talk not only of railroads but of the Far West and of farms and mountains and army life and the oil fields . Sometimes he would go away , usually to a soldiers ' home . Sometimes , too , he would just go awayperiod  --  and neither my mother nor any of her sisters would have the slightest idea where he was . " I 'm worried sick , " mother would say . " We have n't heard from Stevie in eight weeks . " They called him Stevie although he was a strapping six-footer . " Oh , do n't worry , Bella , " her sister Mag would say . " He 'll turn up . If anything had happened to him you 'd have heard about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 'd take turns cheering each other up . Both of them were confirmed pessimists , but never at the same time . Whichever one picked up the pessimism first evidently had a claim on it . The other would automatically assume the role of optimist , although always with a certain lack of real conviction . Sure enough , Uncle Steve would turn up eventually , or else they 'd get a brief letter from him . It was always just one page long , and went something like this : shoulders , breathe deeply , drink lots of milk and get plenty of exercise . In later years I had the idea that my television success did not seem nearly as important to him as the fact that I eventually grew to be six feet three inches tall and to weigh 190 pounds . But no matter how drunk he got , no matter how angry his hidden resentments made him at the rest of the world , he would always be gentle with me . And he had reason , sometimes , to be angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven and we lived on Cottage Grove Avenue . Our apartment had a long , narrow , dark hallway that ? ran from the living room , past a bedroom and bath and back to the dining room . I used to be afraid of the dark and never liked to walk through this endless hallway . One day when I was hurrying along its dismal length , Uncle Steve made a sudden movement behind a drapery and said , " Boo ! " Although he was just playing , I did n't understand that at the time . Overcome by instant fear , shock and sudden rage , 1 kicked him as hard as I could . The point of my shoe caught his leg squarely on the shinbone , and he gasped in pain . But he did n't get angry . He just held me at arm 's length for a moment till l calmed Dear Sister , Just thought I would drop you a line to tell you that I have been here at the soldiers ' home for the past couple of months- . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weather here is good and I am off the drink and feeling fine . I hope you are all well . Take care of yourselves . Your loving brother 1 never did know why Uncle Steve kept going away and coming back , although his departures usually followed a siege of heavy drinking and a big fight . He would be on the straight-and-narrow for several weeks , and then all of a sudden he would n't show up at all for maybe two or three days . When he was sober and in good spirits , Uncle Steve would take me to the Lincoln Park Zoo or to the circus or just for long walks in the park . He was a solid , masculine influence in the sometimes cloyingly feminine world in which I lived . At every street we crossed he would lecture me about looking both ways for traffic . As we walked along in the cool morning air , he 'd tell me to take deep breaths and to keep my back straight like a soldier 's . I had been sickly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed being pampered and fussed over , I suppose I had become a little delicate in personality as well as in body . I think this worried Steve , because he was always telling me about people like Teddy Roosevelt and Jack Dempsey and forever advising me to throw back my down , and then he laughed a little and apologized . He carried the scar on his shin for many years . That must have been one of the times when he would go off and sit by himself somewhere in the house and read and whistle . When his mind was on something else he either whistled or quietly sang an old song called " Sunbonnet Sue . " " Sunbonnet Sue . . . Sunbonnet Sue , " he would whisper softly , " sunshine and roses run second to you . I kissed you twice . . . it was so nice . . . under your bonnet of blue . " Now that whistle was forever stilled . The stewardess ' voice over the loudspeaker brought me back to reality , and I put on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windy and gray as I walked along Halsted Street toward the funeral parlor in the neighborhood where I had lived and played as a young boy . Wearing dark glasses , with my hat pulled down , I was not recognized as I recalled almost-forgotten buildings , sidewalks and stores . At the corner of 54th Street , a gruff , husky , middle-aged policeman rudely commanded traffic , apparently unmindful that some of the people strolling past him were on their way to look at a dead man . The funeral parlor was small and hushed , and I spent the next few minutes shaking hands with various people who wore the peculiar shy , faint , wet-eyed smile I had seen at so many wakes and funerals as a child . Aunt Rose and her husband Charlie met me at the door of the chapel in which Steve lay . Rose had been crying and Charlie 's eyes , too , were moist . Steve had lived with them on and off for many years . I suppose he had been an intolerable intrusion on their privacy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps the most important thing of all , because he was a problem , something to worry about , something to lie awake at night and wonder about . For the Flynns were childless . Now at last this burden , this constant worry , had been lifted from their lives . They felt a sense of loss , July/Aug. ' 83 but no relief . For he had given their lives purpose , something they very probably did not have anymore , now that he was gone . Now they could n't take care of him , send him clothing or bring him hot soup . He had been a thorn in their hearts for more than 25 years , but now that he was gone they felt no numbing pain , only a puzzled emptiness that was written on their blank , distraught faces . I stepped forward to look at Steve 's body . Alive , he had always looked as if he might have recently eased himself off a freight train . But now , in the satin-lined coffin , with the embalmer 's make-up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow , he looked at least 20 years younger than he had when I had seen him a couple of years earlier . He was wearing a brand-new light gray flannel suit , a white shirt , and a good-looking dark blue tie . The effect was fantastically strange , almost as if he had been dressed in a space suit or in priest 's garments or in a football uniform . He looked not at all like the rough , lost lumber-camp male that he had been , but rather like a well-to-do executive . Never was it brought more clearly to my mind that clothes do make the man . Here at last was the man that Uncle Steve might have been , and it had taken death to bring him to this state . Somehow the effect was doubly saddening , more so than if they had buried him in a plain blue workingman 's shirt and a second-hand dark blue suit . He was a better-looking man than I , but there was a strong resemblance between us that 1 had never been aware of before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asking God to welcome him home and to help him . Then I stood and spoke to the others gathered around . A few of the people were flustered at talking to a television entertainer and quite forgot to mention Steve at all , but I understood their nervousness . For the most part , though , those present seemed to be actively , personally saddened by Steve 's death . To one side of the room stood a middle-aged man in the uniform of the Chicago fire department . He was weeping openly . It was good to know that Steve had had friends who cared enough about him to cry at his funeral . A small , jaunty-seedy Irishman introduced himself to me , saying that he played the piano at a nearby saloon . " There were three songs poor Steve used to ask for all the time , " he said , " ' Alice Blue Gown , ' ' The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi , ' and ' Sunbonnet Sue . ' " After a while I was surprised to see the gruff policeman I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , hat in hand , before the casket , quietly , sadly , sweetly , his gentle demeanor contrasting strangely with his earlier attitude . When he shook hands with us , he said , " Steve was a fine man . We 'll all miss him . " On the way to the church Charlie reminisced , speaking softly , his chin trembling . " He was doing fine there for a while , " he said . " He had that job as a night watchman , and we used to bring him hot coffee in a thermos at the school where he worked . " " It was so cold there , " Rose said . " That 's right , it was , " Charlie said . " And he loved that sheepskin vest you sent him , Steve . He wore it all the time . " " He had it on in the room when I went in and found him , " Aunt Rose said . " He was so sick . He looked like he was dead already . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TB , but I never did know exactly what it was that took him . In all probability it was a general physical breakdown brought about by the years of abuse he had given his body through drinking , fighting , sleeping on cold floors and eating unwisely . The priest who said the Mass for the dead looked slightly like James Cagney and preached what I presume was a standard requiem sermon , the theme of which was : What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul ? Inasmuch as Steve had gained very little of the world indeed , I was n't quite sure as to how this thought applied to his case . But since the priest had not known Steve intimately , there was naturally not a continued on page 112 Uncle Steve continued from page 23 great deal else he could say . We did know that Steve had made his peace with God in his final hours , and on the ride to Mount Olivet Cemetery Aunt Rose revealed that his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can one read into that brief phrase ? It seems only the cry of a defeated child . " He never had a chance , " muttered Charlie . The September sky was gray over Mount Olivet as we gathered around the grave , and dead leaves hustled across the ground as the wind whipped about us . Later , when they were taking me to the airport , Charlie said : " He 'd spend his paycheck buying drinks for everyone in the house and then borrow more money . " He shook his head and again murmured , " He never had a chance . " In the end , all the comments made about Steve were similarly sad . They spoke of waste and blindness , of a life that meant nothing at all . Some used the phrase " He was not all there , " as if emotionally , or in some strange way , he had been shortchanged by nature from birth . Some trick of the genes , some cosmic raw deal had been played on him . We had said our goodbyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared into the overcast sky , wondering about my old friend , my mentor . I kept thinking about the significance of his life . There are millions of Uncle Steves in this world . Almost every large family has one . You see them in all the big cities , sometimes on skid row . Alcohol , of course , is the means of their downfall , but it is not really the cause of it . There was something else , something that came before the drink that did the harm , that doomed them to be blown along the lonely streets of life as aimlessly as leaves before the wind . Doomed and aimless . . . but was my Uncle Steve 's life a complete failure ? The gray mist scudded past my porthole , and I thought about an earlier sunny day with big Stevewalking beside me . " Now get your shoulders up , boy , look like a soldier . Be a man like Teddy Roosevelt and Jack Dempsey . " Now it was n't the mist that blurred my vision . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice was excellent , his example deplorable . And yet by listening to him I learned what to do , and by watching him I learned what not to do . How would God judge Uncle Steve ? Would Jesus have judged him for not accumulating this world 's goods , or would he have judged him rather for helping a young boy grow up to manhood , teaching him something about humor and forgiveness ? Would He have judged him for his weaknesses , or for the many friends who mourned him ? Would He have judged him for his despair , or for his excess and perhaps misplaced generosity ? Our plane had broken out of the overcast , and the sun 's reflection was blinding from the white clouds below . Therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much ; but he who is forgiven little , loves little . I seemed to hear a soft whistling : " Sunbonnet Sue . . . Sunbonnet Sue .. . sunshine and roses run second to you . "
