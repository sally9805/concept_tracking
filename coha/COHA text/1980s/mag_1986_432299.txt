 | In the Iran-Iraq War , both sides rumble into battle these days aboard Brazilian-made armored cars that are a match for anything major powers can produce . And in Zimbabwe , the stubby portable rocket launchers hauled by troops bear North Korea 's stamp . Isolated instances of Third World enterprise at work ? Far from it . These are just two examples of a trend that has begun to revolutionize the global arms trade and reshape world politics in ways that are troubling to Washington . Such developing nations as Brazil and India ? and even tiny Singapore ? have elbowed their way into what had been the exclusive domain of the Soviet Union , the U.S. and Western European and Eastern-bloc powers . In the process , experts say , the world has become less dependent on the superpowers for the means to settle conflicts on the battlefield and thus less responsive to their wishes . " The days are long gone , " laments a senior State Department official , " when we could control the flow of weapons . " Washington and Moscow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see arms sales as a prime tool for expanding influence around the globe . But " if both we and the Soviets agreed to restraint , " commented one U.S. official , " it would only mean that the way would be clear for the newcomers to grab an even bigger slice of the pie . " When neither the Americans nor the Soviets are inclined to provide arms , a ready alternative is at hand . Brazil , for instance , has become the fifth-largest arms seller , with annual sales estimated by some at over $2.5 billion and growing fast . One of its newest clients : Libya 's Muammar Qadhafi , now wrapping up a $1 billion deal to buy Brazilian arms . Led by Brazil , North and South Korea and China , some 20 nations today have home-grown arms industries . With few exceptions , their products are dependable , durable and , most important to Third World combatants , cheap . Says arms merchant Sam Cummings of Interarms : " You get more bang for the buck . " In the twilight world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their exports . The figures in the box on this page reflect only official estimates . Most private experts agree that the totals are in reality much higher . For supplier nations , the forging of an arms industry has been viewed as a logical step toward widening an industrial base , essential for any emerging economy . And although the high price of imported-weapons technology has  | made start-up costs high , profits have been quick in coming . The arms trade by developing nations already is generating annual sales of $5.5 billion . While that is only a 15 percent share of the worldwide market , it is an impressive figure considering the relative youth of the industry . By far the most stunning commercial success is Brazil , which now counts clients in more than 40 countries and whose arms exports outstrip coffee as an income producer . While most customers are in the Mideast and Latin America , America 's partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization also have started buying Brazilian . Britain 's Royal Air Force bought 130 Tucano aircraft last year , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first such sale to a NATO member . The future for Brazilians looks even rosier . If their new battle tank passes testing now under way in the sands of Saudi Arabia , as now appears probable , a $1.3 billion sale to the Saudis is expected to follow . Brazil 's best-selling Cascavel armored car and Urutu armored personnel carrier are considered such hot properties that Engesa , the Brazilian firm that makes them , has signed an agreement allowing the FMC Corporation to produce them in the U.S. Even the Pentagon is considering them as an addition to the Rapid Deployment Force . As is true with most Third World producers , Brazil 's industry has become an important source of jobs . It employs 100,000 workers in about 350 firms . But Brazil 's success story also has caused strains both inside the country and with friends and neighbors . The country 's Roman Catholic clergy calls it " shameful " for Brazil to become a major weapons exporter and supplier of arms that often are used by the poor to kill the poor . The Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Africa , Cuba and Iran but otherwise sells to all corners with no strings attached . The policy has brought widespread criticism from abroad . Brazil , unlike the United States , does not insist that the arms it sells to one country not be resold or given to another . Thus , in one instance , weapons sold to Libya wound up in Iranian hands . A secret 1983 sale of Brazilian planes to Honduras drew Latin complaints that Brazil was undermining the Central American peace process . Brazil 's success follows that of Israel , first of the smaller nations to compete head to head with major powers . Unlike Brazil , Israel developed its industry for self-defense and only later began exploiting its commercial potential . Today , Israeli employment depends heavily on an arms industry that became a major exporter in the mid-1960s . America provided the seed money for the Israeli industry , and the support continues today . Most recently , Washington has given Israel more than $300 million in credits to help develop the new Lavi fighter plane , a weapon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of Israel 's customers are nations with image problems , among them Taiwan and South Africa . Among its best-selling items are the ubiquitous Uzi submachine gun , Galil assault rifle , Gabriel sea-skimmer missile and Kfir fighter jet . The Uzi , favored for its dependability and compactness , is standard issue to many of the world 's secret services . Though Israel keeps most arms-sales details secret , it is generally known that the country earns about $1 billion a year from the sale of weapons to about three dozen countries . Although Israel , for obvious reasons , can not sell to its Arab neighbors , it does a big business in Latin America . The country has sold large stores of arms to right-wing dictatorships that were denied U.S. arms on human-rights grounds during the 1970s , including Chile , Guatemala and Argentina . Among its African customers are Zaire , Kenya and Nigeria . More recently , Israel quietly has begun to sell armaments to Communist China , although both deny it . For many Third World arms makers , boom times arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China and North Korea are among those that have cashed in on the bloody conflict . Egypt has sold some $2 billion worth of arms to Iraq . China and North Korea boosted their export totals to $1.6 billion and $300 million , respectively , by selling weapons to both Iran and Iraq . Both Communist states have developed full- fledged arms industries by applying technology obtained from the Soviet Union . China , for example , sells a homemade version of a Soviet MiG21 ? which it calls the F-7 ? at a bargain-basement price of about $2 million . One notable exception to the export trend is India , a major proponent of world disarmament whose own sales have dwindled to a few million dollars ' worth of ammunition . Yet India , too , has built a sophisticated arms industry to equip its own forces , the world 's fourth largest , using Indian , Western and Soviet technology . Only rarely has Washington been able to curb arms sales that it sees as harmful to U.S. interests . With most countries , it simply lacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea into line when that country sought to export replicas of such U.S. military staples as the M-16 rifle and Ml tank . Once entirely dependent on American arms , South Korea now has a booming industry of its own and is adept at reproducing U.S. weapons . Equal in quality to U.S. products , Korean versions are much less expensive . The Koreans , for example , could sell the K-2 , their version of the U.S.-made M-16 rifle , for $100 less than the U.S. model . And although South Korea promised not to export this and certain other weapons , it has still been able to peddle $1.3 billion in arms to foreign customers in recent years . For most nations , the arms trade is simply that ? a trade like any other , but one in which political or moral values are all but irrelevant . In the words of a State Department analyst : " It 's Saturday-night-special time worldwide . "
