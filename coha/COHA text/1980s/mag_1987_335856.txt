It is difficult to understand how the Reagan Administration , which is so suspicious of everything the U.S.S.R. says and does , could allow the Soviets to provide both the labor and materials to build our multimillion-dollar Moscow embassy . And then when it is finished , we are surprised to find it riddled with bugs ( ( NATION , June 29 ) ) . Now Americans are asked to spend millions of dollars more to correct it . I find that amazing , incomprehensible and stupid . <P> Vincent A. Maggio <P> Houston
