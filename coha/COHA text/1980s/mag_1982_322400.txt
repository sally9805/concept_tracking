Swiss commandos lift the bizarre siege of a Polish embassy <P> When it finally came , the commando-style operation unfolded in typically Swiss fashion : it was a combination of precise timing and meticulous efficiency . At 10:42 a.m. last Thursday , a young , casually dressed , plainclothes policeman placed an aluminum container on the front doorstep of a three-story , white stucco mansion that houses the Polish embassy in the leafy Kirchenfeld neighborhood of Bern . Then the policeman climbed back into his beige Volkswagen and slowly drove away . Seconds later , the parcel exploded . The front door of the residence dissolved in smoke and flame , and some 20 members of an elite Bern police squad burst into the building . About eight explosions were heard as tear gas and percussion grenades detonated . Within twelve minutes , the gray-uniformed , red-helmeted troopers had captured and handcuffed four Polish terrorists and were speeding them down the city 's normally placid Elfenstrasse . <P> So ended a bizarre siege in which members of a selfstyled , inchoate Polish " Independent Home Army " imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy . The terrorists ' demands during the siege were hopelessly quixotic : curtailment of martial law in Poland , the release of all political prisoners held in that beleaguered country , and " an end to repression of the Polish " people " by the military regime run by General Wojciech Jaruzelski . <P> The assault marked the first time that Communist Poland 's martial-law troubles have spilled over into violent protest in the West . It gave Poland 's government an opportunity to vilify the suspended Solidarity trade union , only a week after a harsh crackdown on tens of thousands of Polish demonstrators took to the streets to commemorate the second anniversary of Solidarity 's founding . Said Warsaw 's Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu : " Solidarity extremists are now switching , as proved by numerous facts , to terrorist activities . " But the terrorist action was energetically denounced by spokesmen for Solidarity , who disclaimed any connection with the gunmen who had taken over the Bern embassy . Said a union representative : " This is a provocation . Someone is out to discredit us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men carrying suitcases walked calmly into the Polish embassy . Once inside the building , they suddenly pulled out submachine guns that were hidden in their luggage . Trapping a total of 14 people inside the embassy , the militants declared that they were carrying 55 lbs . of dynamite , which they threatened to explode within 48 hours unless their demands were met . Vowed the leader of the band , who identified himself as Colonel Wysocki ( after a 19th century Polish national hero ) : " We are prepared to die . "
