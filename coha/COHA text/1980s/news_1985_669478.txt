Towns and cities in the United States are caught in an insurance crunch . ' ' It ' s a national problem , ' ' says Natalie Wasserman of Public Risk Insurance Management Association in Washington . ' ' It ' s a hard market . . . . It ' s more severe than the last ( downturn ) in the mid- ' 70s. ' ' // // The insurance industry , coming off its worst year ever ( See story right ) , is trying to recover by raising its rates , canceling policies , and refusing to cover certain professions or businesses . While the crunch has hit municipalities before , this time it is squeezing a host of others who want liability insurance - lawyers , commercial fishermen , bar owners , obstetricians , and day-care providers. // People who work in these fields report that their premiums have at least doubled in the past year . For some , premiums have increased tenfold. // Worse , many of those who want liability insurance can not obtain it at any price . The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company to take over its policy , which expired in July . Ms. Marceau decided to keep her position as a selectman after learning Montague had a separate policy to protect town officials , but she says she ' s not sure if that policy will be renewed when it expires in a year or so. // ' ' Town officials are essentially volunteers , ' ' she says . ' ' Not many are going to be willing to put everything on the line . There just won ' t be town officials anymore ( if the liability-insurance problem is not resolved ) . ' ' // Groups caught in the crunch - including the insurance industry itself - agree permanent solutions to the problem are complex . Some experts , citing an increasing readiness of Americans to sue , say reform of the tort system is needed to discourage frivolous lawsuits and control the size of awards . Others want the federal government to become more involved in the reinsurance market to help stabilize the highly cyclical insurance industry . All agree such solutions will take time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases are struggling to find ways to cope. // Day care . The day-care industry has asked the brokerage firm Marsh &; McLennan to work with insurance companies to negotiate a national group policy for day-care providers , says James Strickland , executive director of Child Inc. , in Austin , Texas. // Mr. Strickland , who is ' ' extremely optimistic , but cautious ' ' that a deal will be worked out soon , says affordable liability insurance is a matter of survival for many day-care providers. // ' ' We get 10 or 12 calls a day from people who say they ' re going out of business or are about to go out of business , ' ' says Strickland , who is also a member of Child Care Action Campaign , a nonprofit group that monitors day-care issues nationwide . Although he is not sure how many day-care facilities have folded because of rising insurance costs , Strickland says the small businesses - run by people who take no more than half a dozen children into their homes - are being hit hardest. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry with headlines about child molestation in day-care facilities , then you have what I ' d call a crisis , ' ' he says. // Groups like Child Care Action Campaign have been working to ' ' gain control of the situation ' ' by providing better information about day care to insurance companies , he says . Only 12 percent of all day-care centers ever have a need to use their liability-insurance policies , he adds . For those that do , the average claim is $1 , 200. // Obstetrics . Medical malpractice suits - and medical malpractice insurance - have been on the rise for all physicians since the mid-1970s . Obstetricians , however , paid more for professional liability insurance in 1984 than did doctors in any other specialty , according to a report by the American Medical Association. // The result ? ' ' A significant percentage of our members ' ' have decided to quit delivering babies , says Ken Heland , head of the professional liability department for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . A survey in 1983 showed 9. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstetrics . A new survey is due out next month , and Mr. Heland expects the number to be much higher . ' ' We believe access to health care may be threatened by this , ' ' he says. // Heland cites a number of reasons for spiraling insurance premiums : the number of lawsuits is rising , settlements are higher than ever before , and obstetricians handle some of the most difficult medical cases. // Municipalities . From California to Kentucky , from Massachusetts to Florida , cities and towns either can not afford to renew their liability insurance or can not find an insurance company that will write a policy . As a result , many are searching for new ways to protect themselves against lawsuits. // While some communities are uninsured , others have set up programs to insure themselves . One plan , now becoming more popular , is for towns to band together to create their own insurance association , says Stanley Corcoran of the Massachusetts Municipal Association . Each town pays into the association , which invests the money and pays out losses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the member towns. // Mr. Corcoran warns there must be a cap on liability , however , to protect the association from going bankrupt . Although Massachusetts has a $100 , 000 limit on tort claims , many other states have no such cap , he says . Cities and towns can no longer rely on the common-law doctrine of governmental immunity , which has been steadily eroded in the courts , he adds. // Many municipalities are also working to reduce the risk that they will be sued . Plainfield , Mass. , decided to close its beaches because it couldn ' t afford lifeguards , Corcoran says . Efforts by other cities to reduce risk include reexamining procedures for hiring and firing and removing hazards in the workplace. // //
