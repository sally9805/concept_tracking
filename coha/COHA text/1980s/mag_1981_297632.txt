Richard V. Allen may suffer from a poor memory , a self-admitted lack of good judgment and a reluctance to break off relations with old business associates despite the sensitivity of his position in the White House . But at least the President 's embattled National Security Adviser can not be accused of giving up without a fight . After his surprise announcement that he was taking an " administrative leave " ( with pay ) , the hitherto reticent Allen faced any and all questions of reporters in an extraordinary media blitz ( see PRESS ) . <P> Amid this saturation campaign , Allen got a helpful boost from the Justice Department , which declared that no federal crime had been committed when he intercepted and failed to report a $1,000 honorarium that the Japanese magazine Shufu-no-Tomo had tried to give Nancy Reagan . As a result , Attorney General William French Smith officially closed the Justice Department 's inquiry into the $1,000 gift and declared that a special prosecutor would not be appointed to dig further . <P> Allen was still the focus of two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wristwatches , valued at about $270 , from the same Japanese friends who had asked his help in setting up the magazine 's brief interview with the First Lady . The second involved the question of whether Allen had violated any laws when he first claimed in a financial disclosure form that he had sold his former business , an international consulting firm , in 1978 . Allen later corrected the date to Jan. 19,1981 , the day before he took office . <P> Based on interviews with 36 people in Japan and the U.S. , the FBI probe of the $1,000 honorarium showed that " there is no evidence that the money was intended for Allen or was kept by Allen for a corrupt purpose . " According to the Justice Department 's summary of the investigation , Chizuko Takase , wife of a longtime business associate of Allen 's , asked his help on the magazine interview with Mrs. Reagan . Allen passed on the request to the Reagan transition officials in charge of scheduling , recommending that the interview be granted if the First Lady 's time permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Reagan if she agreed to an interview , Mrs. Takase and two women working for the Japanese magazine flew to Washington . The three drew $10,000 from the magazine 's funds to cover their trip expenses as well as the honorarium . That explains a $10,000 notation found on the envelope that Allen had received . The interview , which lasted for ten minutes at most , took place in the White House on Jan. 21 . One of the Japanese women gave Mrs. Reagan a lacquer box ( valued at $75 ) , which she turned over to White House officials . Allen stepped forward when another of the women tried to give Mrs. Reagan an envelope and some newsclippings . When asked by one of the women to sign a receipt for the envelope , Allen declined . He did not return the envelope , says the report , " because he thought it would offend " the Japanese .
