Those $99 ticket prices , a boon to travelers , are a bane to the airlines <P> <P> Delighted air travelers have been crowding ticket counters and tying up telephone reservation lines during the latest round of fare wars . For just $99 a seat one way they have been flying merrily between cities like New York and Los Angeles-a trip that can cost four times as much at full price . But the fares that have been so pleasant for passengers have been torture for the troubled airline industry . Some executives privately refer to the deep discounts as going-out-of-business sales . Says Monte Lazarus , senior vice president of United Airlines , the largest U.S. carrier : " The fares are suicidal , fratricidal and genocidal . " <P> The ruinous price wars are just one sign of the chaos that has overtaken the industry since the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 gave rise to wider competition . U.S. carriers lost an estimated $550 million in 1982 , the third consecutive year of record deficits . Experts now fear that some weaker airlines may follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among those considered at risk : Pan American , which had $327 million in operating losses last year , the most for any airline ; and Air Florida , a onetime highflyer that encountered turbulence after expanding too fast . The test for some carriers could come quickly , since the late winter months are normally slack ones for air travel . <P> Astonishingly enough , however , such gloom has not prevented a number of airlines from raising cash on Wall Street , which is not notably kind to losers . Although TWA dropped $101.3 million in 1982 , for example , it announced plans last week for an offering of 5 million shares of common stock , designed to bring in up to $85 million . Moneymen treated that news with interest rather than as a sign of financial chutzpah . U.A.L. , the parent of United , which lost $66.7 million last year , said it would offer 3 million shares . <P> The biggest shocker came Wednesday when investors snapped up a $135 million issue of Pan Am notes . Those went so fast that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securities as well . To be sure , the notes have plenty of enticements : they pay 15% interest , are secured by airplanes worth an estimated $215 million , and can be converted into Pan Am common stock at $5.50 a share . That last feature alone could provide a handsome return , since Pan Am stock could take off if the airline became profitable again . Pan Am shares closed at 4% last week . <P> Investors are willing to risk money on this ailing industry because they suspect that it may be about to return to health . Airline stocks have risen by an average of 66% since August , a run-up that ranks among the best of any industry . Says Robert Joedicke , an airline analyst at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb : " Airline profitability is entering a recovery period that should gain momentum during 1983 and continue for several years . " A report from the investment banking firm of Morgan Stanley puts it in plainer English : " Every portfolio should have an airline stock . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
