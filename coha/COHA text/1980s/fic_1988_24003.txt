S T OR Y UNTIME OF THE IMAM By Salman Rushdie Gibreel Farishta , for fifteen years the biggest star in the history of the Indian movies , had spent the greater part of his unique career incarnating , with absolute conviction , the countless deities of the subcontinent in the popular genre films known as theologicals . Then , during a near-fatal illness , he used every conscious minute to call upon God , without success ; until he lost his faith . On the day he was discharged from the hospital , he told the driver to take him to the Taj hotel , where in the great dining room he devoured a loaded plateful of the forbidden flesh of the swine ; rashers of bacon , pork sausages , hams . And after he ate the pigs the retribution began , a nocturnal retribution , a punishment of dreams . In these visions he was always present , not as himself but as his namesake , the archangel Gibreel , large as life . And every time he went to sleep the dreams started up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were serial visions , inexorable , impossible to escape . Gibreel , fleeing his old life and arriving in London , brought the visions with him . ? This , for instance , has started coming : a mansion block built in the Dutch style in a part of London , which he will subsequently identify as Kensington , to which the dream flies him at Salman Rushdie is the author of Midnight 's Children and Shame . His new novel , The Satanic Verses , will be published in February by Viking . high speed past Barkers department store and the small gray house with double bay windows where Thackeray wrote Vanity Fair and the square with the convent where the little girls in uniform are always going in , but never come out , and the house where Talleyrand lived in his old age when after a thousand and one chameleon changes of allegiance and principle he took on the outward form of the French ambassador to London , and there it is , a seven-story corner block with green wrought-iron balconies up to the fourth , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and on the fourth floor it pushes aside the heavy curtains at the living-room window and finally there he sits , unsleeping as usual , eyes wide in the dim yellow light , staring into the future , the bearded and turbaned Imam . Who is he ? An exile . Which must not be confused with , allowed to run into , all the other words that people throw around : ? migr ? , expatriate , refugee , immigrant , silence , cunning . Exile is a dream of glorious return . Exile is a vision of revolution : Elba , not St. Helena . It is an endless paradox : looking forward by always looking back . The exile is a ball hurled high into the air . He hangs there , frozen in time , translated into a photograph ; denied motion , suspended impossibly above his native earth , he awaits the inevitable moment at which the photograph must begin to move , and the earth reclaim its own . These are the things the Imam thinks . His home is a rented flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The thick wallpaper , olive stripes on a cream ground , has faded a little , enough to emphasize the brighter rectangles and ovals that indicate where pictures used to hang . The Imam is the enemy of images . When he moved in , the pictures slid noiselessly from the walls and slunk from the room , removing themselves from the rage of his unspoken disapproval . Some representations , however , are permitted to remain , On the mantelpiece he keeps a small group of postcards bearing conventional images of his homeland , which he calls simply Desh : a mountain looming over a city ; a picturesque village scene beneath a mighty tree ; a mosque . But in his bedroom , on the wall facing the hard cot where he lies , there hangs a more potent icon , the portrait of a woman of exceptional force , famous for her profile of a Grecian statue and the black hair that is as long as she is high . A powerful woman , his enemy , his other : he keeps her close . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will be clutching his portrait beneath her royal cloak or hiding it in a locket at her throat . She is the Empress , and her name is -- what else ? ? Ayesha . On this island , the exiled Imam , and at home in Desh , She . They plot each other 's deaths . The curtains , thick golden velvet , are kept shut all day , because otherwise the evil thing might creep into the apartment : foreignness , Abroad , the alien nation . The harsh fact that he is here and not There , upon which all his thoughts are fixed . On those rare occasions when the Imam goes out to take the Kensing-ton air , at the center of a square formed by eight young men in sunglasses and bulging suits , he folds his hands before him and fixes his gaze upon them , so that no element or particle of this hated city  --  this sink of iniquities which humiliates him by giv-ing him sanctuary , so that he must be behold-en to it in spite of the lustfulness , greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a dust speck , in his eyes . When he leaves this loathed exile to return in triumph to that other city beneath the post-card mountain , it will be a point of pride to be able to say that he re-mained in complete ig-norance of the Sodom in which he had been obliged to wait ; igno-rant , and therefore un-sullied , unaltered , pure . And another reason for the drawn curtains is that of course there are eyes and ears around him , not all of them friendly . The orange build-ings are not neutral , Somewhere across the street there will be zoom lenses , video equip-ment , jumbo mikes ; and always the risk of snip-ers . Above and below and beside the Imam are Illustrations by David Johnson vorites , the American convert , formerly a successful singer , now known as Bilal X. in a certain nightclub to which the Imam is in the habit of sending his lieutenants to listen in to certain other persons belonging to certain opposed factions , Bilal met a young man from Desh , also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It turned out that this Mahmood was scared within an inch of his life . He had recently shacked up with a gcn-i , a long red woman with a big figure , and then it turned out that the previous lover of his beloved Renata was the exiled boss of the SAVAK torture organization of the Shah of Iran . The number one Grand Panjandrum himself , not some minor sadist with a talent for extracting toenails or setting fire to eyelids , but the grear hararnzada in person . The day after Mahmood and Renata moved into their new apartment a letter arrived for Mahmood . Okay , shit-eater , you 're fucking my woman , I just wanted to say hello . The next day a second letter arrived . By the way , prick , I forgot to mention , here is your new telephone number . At that point Mahmood and Renata had asked for a new ex-directory listing but had not as yet been given their number by the telephone company . When it came through two days later and was exactly the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all at once . When he saw it lying on the pillow he joined his hands together in front of Renata and begged , " Baby , I love you , but you 're too hot for me , please go somewhere , far far . " When the Imam was told this story he shook his head and said , that whore , who will touch her now , in spite of her lust-creating body ? She put a stain on herself worse than leprosy ; thus human beings do mutilate themselves . But the true moral of the fahle was the need for external vigilance . London was a city in which the ex-boss of SAVAK had great connections in the telephone company and the Shah 's ex-chef ran a thriving restaurant in Hounslow . Such a welcoming city , such a refuge , they take all types . Keep the curtains drawn . loors three to five of this block of mansion flats are , for the moment , all the homeland that Imam possesses . Here there are rifles and shortwave radios and rooms in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into several telephones . There is no alcohol here , nor are playing cards or dice anywhere in evidence , and the only woman is the one hanging on the old man 's bedroom wall . In this surrogate homeland , which the insomniac saint thinks of as his waiting room or transit lounge , the central heating is at full blast night and day , and the windows are tightly shut . The exile can not forget , and must therefore simulate , the dry heat of Desh , the once and future land where even the moon is hot and dripping like a fresh , buttered chapati. 0 that longed-for part of the world where the sun and moon are male but their hot sweet light is named with female names . At night the exile parts his curtains and the alien moonlight sidles into the room , its coldness striking his eyeballs like a nail . He winces , narrows his eyes . Loose-robed , frowning , ominous , awake ; this is the Imam . Exile is a soulless country . In exile , the furniture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same store and in too much of a hurry : shiny silver sofas with fins like old Buicks DeSoros Oldsmobiles , glass-fronted bookcases containing not books but clippings files . In exile the shower goes scalding hot whenever anybody turns on a kitchen tap , so that when the Imam goes to bathe , his entire retinue must remember not to fill a kettle or rinse a dirty plate , and when the Imam goes to the toilet his disciples leap scalded from the shower . In exile no food is ever cooked ; the dark-spectacled bodyguards go out for takeaway . In exile all attempts to put down roots look like treason : they are admissions of defeat . The Imam is the center of a wheel . Movement radiates from him , around the clock . His son , Khalid , enters his sanctum bearing a glass of water , holding it in his right hand with his left palm under the glass . The Imam drinks water constantly , one glass every five minutes , to keep himself clean ; the water itself is cleansed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . All the young men surrounding him are well aware of his famous monograph on water , whose purity , the Imam believes , communicates itself to the drinker , its thinness and simplicity , the ascetic pleasures of its taste . " The Empress , " he points out , " drinks wine . " Burgundies , clarets , hocks mingle their intoxicating corruptions within that body both fair and foul . The sin is enough to condemn her for all time without hope of redemption . The picture on his bedroom wall shows the Empress Ayesha holding , in both hands , a human skull filled with a dark red fluid . The Empress drinks blood , but the Imam is a water man . " Not for nothing do the peoples of our hot lands offer it reverence , " the monograph proclaims . " Water , preserver of life . No civilized individual can refuse it to another . A grandmother , be her limbs ever so arthritically is son , water-carrying Khalid , bows before his father like a pilgrim at a shrine , informs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salman Farsi . Bilal is at the radio transmitter , broadcasting the day 's message , on the agreed frequency , to Desh . The Imam is a massive stillness , an immobility . He is living stone . His great gnarled hands , granite-gray , rest heavily on the wings of his high-backed chair . His head , looking too large for the body beneath , lolls ponderously on the surprisingly scrawny neck that can be glimpsed through the gray-black wisps of beard . The Imam 's eyes are clouded ; his lips do not move . He is pure force , an elemental being ; he moves without motion , acts without doing , speaks without uttering a sound . He is the conjurer and history is his trick . No , not history : something stranger . The explanation of this conundrum is to be heard , at this very moment , on certain surreptitious radio waves , on which the voice of the American convert Bilal is singing the Imam 's holy song . Bilal the muezzin : his voice enters a ham radio in Kensington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Imam himself . Beginning with ritual abuse of the Empress , with lists of her crimes , murders , bribes , sexual relations with lizards , and so on , he proceeds eventually to issue in ringing tones the Imam 's nightly call to his people to rise up against the evil of her state . " We will make a revolution , " the imam proclaims through him , " that is a revolt not only against a tyrant but against history . " For there is an enemy beyond Ayesha , and it is History herself . History is the blood-wine that must no longer be drunk . History , the intoxicant , the creation and possession of the Devil , of the great Shaitan , the greatest of the lies  --  progress , science , rights  --  against which the Imam has set his face . History is a deviation from the Path , knowledge is a delusion , because the sum of knowledge was complete on the day Al-Lah finished his revelation to Mahound . " We will unmake the veil of history , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unraveled , we will see Paradise standing there , in all its glory and light . " The Imam chose Bilal for this task on account of the beauty of his voice , which in its previous incarnation succeeded in climbing the Everest of the hit parade , not once but a dozen times , to the very top . The voice is rich and authoritative , a voice in the habit of being listened to ; well nourished , highly trained , the voice of American confidence , a weapon of the West turned against its makers , whose might upholds the Empress and her tyranny . In the early days Bilal X protested at such a description of his voice . He , too , belonged to an oppressed people , he insisted , so that it was uniust to equate him with the Yankee imperialists . The Imam answered , not without gentleness : Bilal , your suffering is ours as well . But to be raised in the house of power is to learn its ways , to soak them up , through that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of power , its timbre , its posture , its way of being with others . It is a disease , Bilal , infecting all who come too near it . If the powerful trample over you , you are infected by the soles of their feet . Bilal continues to address the darkness . " Death to the tyranny of the Empress . Ayesha , of calendars , of America , of time ! We seek the eternity , the timelessness , of God , His still waters , not her flowing wines . " Burn the books and trust the Book ; shred the papers and hear the Word , as it was explicated by your interpreter and Imam . " Ameen , " Bilal said , concluding the night 's proceedings . While , in his sanctum , the Imam sends a message of his own : and summons , conjures up , the archangel , Gibreel . Gibreel sees himself in the dream : no angel should know , are gone . " The Imam closes his eyes , sighs . The carpet extrudes long hairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . " You do n't need me , " Gibreel emphasizes . The revelation is complete . Let me go . " The other shakes his head , and speaks , except that his bps do not move , and it is Bilal 's voice that fills Gibreel 's ears , even though the broadcaster is nowhere to be seen , tonight ' . s the night , the voice says , and you must fly me to Jerusalem . Then the apartment dissolves and they are standing on the roof beside the water tank , because the Imam , when he wishes to move , can remain still and move the world around him . His beard is blowing in the wind . It is longer now ; if it were not for the wind that catches at it as if it were a flowing chiffon scarf , it would touch the ground by his feet ; he has red eyes , and his voice hangs around him in the sky . T gleP me . Gibreel argues : Seems you can do it easily by yourself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slings his beard over his shoulder , hoists up his skirts to reveal two spindly legs with an almost monstrous covering of hair , and leaps high into the night air , twirls himself about , and settles on Gibreel 's shoulders , clutching onto him with fingernails that have grown into long , curved claws . Gibreel feels himself rising into the sky , bearing the old man of the sea , the Imam with hair that grows longer by the minute , streaming in every direction , his eyebrows like pennants in the wind . Jerusalem , he wonders , which way is that ? ? And then , it 's a slippery word , Jerusalem , it can be an idea as well as a place : a goal , an exaltation . Where is the Imam 's Jerusalem ? " The fall of the harlot , " the disembodied voice resounds in his ears . " Her crash , the Babylonian whore . " They zoom through the night . The moon is heating up , beginning to bubble like cheese under a grill ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , moon-drips that hiss and bubble on the sizzling griddle of the sky . Land appears below them . The heat grows intense . It is an immense landscape , reddish , with flat-topped trees . They fly over mountains that are also flat-topped ; even the stones , here , are flattened by the heat . Then they come to a high mountain of almost perfectly conical dimensions , a mountain that also sits postcarded on a mantelpiece far away ; and in the shadow of the mountain , a city , sprawling at its feet like a supplicant , and on the mountain 's lower slopes , a palace , the palace , her place : the Empress , whom radio messages have unmade . This is a revolution of radio hams . Gibreel , with the Imam riding him like a carpet , swoops lower , and in the steaming night itlooks as if the streets are alive , they seem to he writhing , like snakes ; while in front of the palace of the Empress 's defeat a new hill seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on here ? The Imam 's voice hangs in the sky : " Come down . I will show you Love . " They are at rooftop level when Gibreel realizes that the streets are swarming with people . Human beings , packed so densely into those snaking paths that they have blended into a larger composite entity , relentless , serpentine . The people move slowly , at an even pace , down alleys into lanes , down lanes into side streets , down side streets into highways , all of them converging upon the grand avenue , twelve lanes wide and lined with giant eucalyptus trees , that leads to the palace gates . The avenue is packed with humanity ; it is the central organ of the new , many-headed being . Seventy abreast , the people walk gravely toward the Empress 's gates . In front of which her household guards are waiting in three ranks , lying , kneeling , and standing , with machine guns at the ready . The people are walking up the slope toward the guns ; seventy at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they die , and then the next seventy climb over the bodies of the dead , the guns giggle once again , and the hill of the dead grows higher . Those behind it commence , in their turn , to climb . In the dark doorways of the city there are mothers with covered heads , pushing their beloved sons into the parade , go , be a martyr , do the needful , die . " You see how they love me , " says the disembodied voice . " No tyranny on earth can withstand the power of this slow , walking love . " " This is n't love , " Gibreel , weeping , replies . " It 's hate . She has driven them into your arms . " The explanation sounds thin , superficial . " They love me , " the Imam 's voice says , " because I am water . I am fertility and she is decay . They love me for my habit of smashing clocks . Human beings who turn away from God lose love and certainty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present , and future ; the timeless time , that has no need to move . We long for the eternal , and I am eternity . She is nothing : a tick or took . She looks in her mirror every day and is terrorized by the idea of age , of time passing . Thus she is the prisoner of her own nature ; she , too , is in the chains of Time . After the revolution there will he no clocks ; we 'll smash the lot . The word clock will be expunged from our dictionaries . After the revolution there will be no birthdays . We shall all be born again , all of us the same unchanging age in the eye of Almighty God . " He falls silent now because below the great moment has come : the people have reached the guns . Which are silenced in their turn , as the endless serpent of the people , the gigantic python of the risen masses , embraces the guards , suffocating them , strangling , and silences the lethal chuckling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The lights of the palace are extinguished as the people walk toward it , at the same measured pace as before . Then , from within the darkened palace , there rises a hideous sound , beginning as a high , thin , piercing wail , then deepening into a howl , an ululation loud enough to fill every cranny of the city with its rage . Then the golden dome of the palace bursts open like an egg , and rising from it , glowing with blackness , is a mythological apparition with vast black wings , her hair streaming loose , as long and black as the Imam 's is long and white : Al-Lat , Gibreel understands , bursting out of Ayesha 's shell . " Kill her , " the Imam commands . Gibreel sets him down on the palace 's ceremonial balcony , his arms outstretched to encompass the joy of the people , a sound that drowns even the howls of the goddess and rises up like a song . And then he is being propelled into the air , having no option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , seeing him coming , turns , crouches in air , and , moaning dreadfully , comes at him with all her might . Gibreel understands that the Imam , fighting by proxy as usual , will sacrifice him as readily as he did the hill of corpses at the palace gate , that he is a suicide soldier in the service of the cleric 's cause . I am weak , he thinks , I am no match for her , but she , too has been weakened by her defeat . The Imam 's strength moves Gibreel , places thunderbolts in his hands , and the battle is joined ; he hurls lightning spears into her feet and she plunges comets into his groin , we are killing each other , he thinks , we will die and there will he two new constellations in space : Al-Lat and Gibreel . Like exhausted warriors on a corpse-littered field , they totter and slash . Both are failing fast . She falls . Down she tumbles , Al-Lat queen of the night ; crashes upside down to earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headless black angel with her wings ripped off , by a little wicket gate in the palace gardens , all in a crumpled heap . And Gibreel , looking away from her in horror , sees the Imam grown monstrous , lying in the palace forecourt with his mouth yawning open at the gate ; as the people march through the gates he swallows them whole . The body of Al-Lat has shriveled on the grass , leaving behind only a dark stain ; and now every clock in the capital city of Desh begins to chime , and goes on unceasingly , beyond twelve , beyond twenty-four , beyond one thousand and one , announcing the end of Time , the hour that is beyond measuring , the hour of the exile 's return , of the victory of water over wine , of the commencement of the Untime of the Imam . ?
