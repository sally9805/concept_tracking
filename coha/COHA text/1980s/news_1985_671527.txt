The problem for most runners is that as soon as they cross the finish line - with solo gestures of thrusting arms in the air or blowing kisses or even turning a handstand - most runners dissolve into a cast of thousands , wrapped in plastic cloaks. // This plastic army assembled in the woods of Central Park yesterday in the finest sporting day of the year in New York . Other events come and go , Billy Martin comes and goes ( and comes and goes some more ) , and only the names of his successors and predecessors change , but the New York City Marathon is a delightful constant. // On Marathon Day , Central Park becomes a civic tailgate picnic , with cheery volunteers offering food and drink and medical care and rubdowns and calls of " good race. " // The runners reach the finish line in varied conditions , ranging from lurching semiconsciousness to sprinting exultation . One runner , Rolf Gilstein , the cellist with the Laurentian String Quartet in Bronxville , N.Y. , even had enough energy left to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock that read 3 : 16. 54. // But right after the sunlight of the finish line comes the shadows of the chute area , where runners turn in their numbers and merge in a sea of rustling plastic . Then reality intrudes , as the runners try to find their friends and relatives , and begin to pay back the debts to their bodies. // There is a bit of the compulsive gambler in long-distance runners , who make certain promises to their bodies : " Just stick with me this once , trust me , and I ' ll pay you back , I promise. " // The runners are channeled into a Family Area , split into English-Speaking ( divided into sections for last initials ) and Foreign ( divided by flags ) . There , many runners mill about , some with " thousand-mile stares " the late James Jones described in soldiers ' eyes , others merely searching for their rooting sections. // Steve Ludiker of Tulsa , Okla. , had that faraway look in his eye . He was standing under the " L " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him there. // " It ' s my first marathon , " he said . " I ' ve been training up toward it , and I promised myself that if I could get in , I ' d run it . I wanted to finish and I wanted to feel good at the end , and I did both , in 3 : 42. " // Suddenly his face brightened , as he spotted his friend , who had worked her way through the mob . They kissed , and then he talked about their plans for the evening : // " I guess we ' ll go out to eat somewhere , " Ludiker said , holding a package of fruit and bagel distributed at the finish line . " Chinatown maybe . This whole thing looks good to me. " // Another immediate concern was treating the layers of skin and muscle and bone that had taken him 26 miles and 385 yards across five boroughs . " I ' d love a hot tub , " he said , " or just a bath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicky Simpson reminded him . " We asked for a better room , but they didn ' t give us one. " // Ludiker groaned and said , " Maybe we can pay the maids something and use the bathtub in another room . For $10 , we might be able to do that . " Over in the " G " section , hot running water was also in the minds of Al and Siv Goldstein , husband and wife from River Edge , N.J. , who had completed the course in 3 : 17 and 3 : 34. 32 , respectively. // " I ' m going home and bring the telephone in the bathroom , so everybody can call me while I ' m in the tub , " Mrs. Goldstein said . " My husband can join me . We ' ll have a couple of beers and watch the World Series. " // Nothing so sedentary was planned by Pieter Hoets of the Netherlands , a banker who resides in New York . He was holding his T-shirt , caked with salt from his labors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city. // " We ' re going to a disco , Area , " he announced , making a stiff-thighed parody of a disco maneuver . " Got to get your legs moving. " // The Gallacher family of Coram , L.I. , was holding a joyous reunion , following some brief eye contact on First Avenue , more than an hour earlier , when Chris Gallacher had spotted the " Go For It , Dad " sign held by his three children , Michael , Jason and Allison . His mother , Dorothy , and his wife , Sue , were also in attendance. // " This year I truly enjoyed myself , " he said . " I stayed within myself and just enjoyed the crowd scene . I loved the ethnic sections in Brooklyn and particularly the run up First Avenue and hearing lots of screams for Daddy. " // John Dilkes walked through the crowd by himself , looking for no welcoming signs , listening for no cheers , because the people who cared that he had done 3 : 56 were all back in Leicester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel , have a couple of beers and a bath and then head for the airport , " he said . " I ' m on the 8 : 15 Air India flight tonight . " A stranger groaned at the thought of flying in a cramped airplane seat , perhaps wedged in by other bodies , on an overnight flight across the ocean , but Dilkes had one consoling thought : " At least I ' ll sleep well. " // The mobs of runners continued to pour toward the finish line as shadows fell across Central Park , and anxious families still kept vigil for their five-hour and six-hour heroes and heroines. // For Fred Lebow , the impresario who is always too busy to run in his own marathon , there was a personal finish line. // " This was the toughest one yet , " he said amid the cacophony at the finish line at Tavern on the Green . " I realized it was going to be too hot at 9 A.M. today . Usually I ' m cold while we ' re at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried about the air quality because of the emissions in New Jersey , but I guess it turned out all right . I ' ll wait until almost everybody has finished , and then I ' ll go to the awards ceremony , but this year for the first time I think I ' ll skip the disco party. " // Was Lebow going home to crash after hectic weeks and months of planning the marathon ? // " I ' ll go for a little run first , " he said. //
