The President made it sound routine . " We 're conducting exercises such as we 've conducted before , " he said .

The U.S. naval display will be accompanied by U.S. and Honduras army maneuvers near Nicaragua 's border . " The idea is to intimidate , " a Pentagon official said in reference to Nicaragua , " and see if we can have a real effect on the flow of arms " to insurgents in El Salvador . <P> The exercises at sea look like old-fashioned gunboat diplomacy on a far grander scale .

No actual interdiction of ships carrying arms to Nicaragua or El Salvador is planned , although suspect vessels will be watched and photographed .
