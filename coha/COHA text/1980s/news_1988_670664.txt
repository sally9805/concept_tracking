Such action would mark the first time the agency had applied restrictions to a drug it had already approved for marketing. // The committee also suggested that patients and doctors be more strongly warned about the dangers the drug poses to fetuses . Accutane , which was approved for marketing in 1982 , can cause severe and often lethal birth defects . Despite an extensive educational campaign by the drug ' s manufacturer , Roche Laboratories , a division of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , and the drug agency , women have taken Accutane while pregnant. // The agency has received official reports of 62 babies who were born with severe defects after their mothers took the drug . But a study by members of the agency ' s staff , which Roche has challenged as flawed , estimated that 900 to 1 , 300 babies were born with severe defects because of the drug from 1982 to 1986 . <> <> Uncertainty on Restrictions // The advisory committee left unclear exactly how the drug ' s distribution should be restricted , but it heard testimony from dermatologists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available to women only from a limited number of specialists or by prescriptions signed by both a dermatologist and a gynecologist who had instructed the women on birth control. // But the Commissioner of Food and Drugs , Dr. Frank E. Young , said it was not clear that such restrictions could be applied . Normally , once a drug is licensed , doctors can prescribe it at will . Dr. Young said the F.D.A. ' s lawyers were determining whether the agency could restrict access to the drug without changes in Federal laws . If not , the Government ' s only recourse would be to ask Roche Laboratories to voluntarily restrict its sale. // While the advisory committee ' s recommendation is not binding , it carries a great deal of weight. // The drug , whose generic name is isotretinoin , was approved by the agency in 1982 for the " treatment of severe , recalcitrant , cystic acne unresponsive to conventional therapy , " including systemic antibiotics . Such acne is characterized by deep , inflammatory cysts that can leave substantial scars. // A recent F.D.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less severe cases and that some women did not realize its dangers or took it without knowing they were pregnant . But Hoffmann-La Roche challenged the data in the memorandum , calling them " essentially meaningless . " And the American Academy of Dermatology , while recognizing the danger of birth defects , issued a statement saying that " no other form of therapy is as effective " against severe acne . <> <> Officials Express Alarm // At today ' s committee hearing , officials of the agency argued that substantial numbers of fetuses are exposed to Accutane . They also said they were alarmed by the results described in the memorandum and uncertain about how accurately they reflected use of the drug nationwide. // " We struggled , and I mean struggled , over the interpretation of these data , " said Dr. David Graham , who is group leader of the agency ' s epidemiology branch . " For myself , the acceptable number of exposed pregnancies is zero . " The data in the memorandum came from a study of Medicaid patients in Michigan. // Accutane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the babies exposed to it before birth , according to Dr. Godfrey Oakley , director of the division of birth defects and developmental disabilities at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . These defects include facial malformations , typically missing or misplaced ears , severe mental retardation and serious heart defects. // Several experts at the F.D.A. and the Centers for Disease Control who spoke today said in their testimony and in interviews that Accutane should be removed from the market altogether because it would be impossible to prevent its use by pregnant women . But they said they doubted there would be much support for such a drastic step. // The drug can cause birth defects very early in pregnancy , before women know they are pregnant . It can also cause birth defects in very small doses . One woman took just three tablets and had a deformed child. // Because the birth defects are so severe , said Dr. Graham of the F.D.A. , " the benefit of the drug to the mother never outweighs the risk to the fetus. " // But dermatologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug is urgently needed for the treatment of severe acne. // Dr. Alan Shalita , a dermatologist at Downstate Medical Center in New York who is a consultant to Roche , asked : , " Are there any alternatives ? I wish I could say there were . " Dr. Shalita and Roche experts added that if Accutane were not sold by prescription , desperate patients would obtain it on the black market. // Dr. Graham said his group ' s analysis of the Medicaid data led him to extrapolate that more than 1 , 300 babies were born with severe birth defects in the past six years. // Dr. Graham added that his group recently looked at more data from a health maintenance organizaton in Puget Sound , Wash. , which had as clients middle-class , mostly white women . These women had fewer pregnancies than the Michigan Medicaid patients , but still had fetuses exposed to Accutane. // From the Washington data , Dr. Graham projected that there were 250 babies born with severe birth defects because their mothers took Accutane . He concluded that a mid-range estimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about 600 malformed babies have been born in the United States as a result of Accutane . <> <> Company Assails Estimates // Representatives from Roche vigorously contested these estimates and argued that the true number of Accutane babies is probably closer to the 62 that were actually reported. // But many at the meeting grew impatient with these arguments over how many babies were affected . Dr. Edward Lammer of the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program said , " I think it is unacceptable to make public policy by counting bodies. " // Dr. Lammer said the only things comparable to Accutane in causing birth defects are thalidomide and the German measles virus . If this country were to treat Accutane the way it treated the sedative thalidomide , it would have to impose extremely severe restrictions on its distribution , he said. // Thalidomide caused thousands of birth defects in Europe in the 1960 ' s . It was never licensed for sale in the United States and licensing in other countries was revoked after the drug ' s dangers became clear . However , its use against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who need the drug must take it in a specified hospital under careful monitoring . None have taken it while pregnant. // Expensive mandatory vaccination programs are aimed at eliminating the risk of birth defects from German measles. // Dr. J. David Erickson of the Centers for Disease Control said that Accutane was not regulated in accordance with its danger to fetuses . " We ' ve watched this situation develop with ever-increasing concern , " he said. //
