For this reason the department of design in the Museum of Modern Art has a discreet , not to say clandestine , quality . One of the last bastions of unreconstructed modernism , it has always championed purity and simplicity of style . Although it may not go quite as far as Adolf Loos , the Austrian architect and designer , who said that ornament was a crime , a dictionary of 20th-century ornament as it appears in the museum ' s design collections would be a slim volume. // Yet the visitor who races on , looking neither to left nor to right , toward the museum ' s galleries of painting , sculpture , drawings and prints may be passing up something important . Design is history . It is social history . ( Think of the corset , and of the French couturier Paul Poiret , who got rid of it . ) It is esthetic history . ( Think how we can date almost to the day the visual impact of the portable typewriter , the chair that stacked and the long-superseded soda siphon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological history . ( Think of the swept-wing aircraft and the Japanese bullet-train. ) . // Last season ' s " Machine Age " exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum showed just how absorbing design could be , even to those who had never thought about it . And in a much smaller but nonetheless challenging way the exhibition called " Mario Bellini : Designer " at the Museum of Modern Art has a comparable claim upon us . Though not large , it includes objects of universal applicability , like tables and chairs and sofas . ( The visitor is encouraged to sit on the sofas , within the limits of propriety . ) There are also marvels of advanced technology that Mario Bellini has endowed with a deadpan playfulness not usually encountered in adding machines , television sets or automobile dashboards . He has , in fact , got the second machine age to relax , with no loss of efficiency. // As a designer , he has led a charmed life . Born in Milan in 1935 , he came of age , in professional terms , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know-how and aggressive marketing . After graduating as an architect in 1959 , he went into design , full-time , and in 1963 , at the age of only 28 , he was appointed chief industrial design consultant to Olivetti. // This critic well remembers a visit around that same time to the Olivetti headquarters in Ivrea , a dumpy little company town not far from the Val d ' Aosta . Olivetti has always owed a large part of its success to the prescient hiring of intellectuals and idea-men who were sent to Ivrea on a collegiate basis and kept there on a very loose rein . Sometimes it worked . Sometimes it didn ' t . ( Ivrea is a very long way from anywhere amusing . Boredom , once felt there , sets like cement . ) But , on the whole , Olivetti has always known how to move and how to grow , and never more so than when it hired Mario Bellini. // He arrived there at a crucial moment in 20th-century technology . Miniaturization , on the one hand , and electronics on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in daily use would have to be redesigned . Where designers had been putting a sleek and hopefully stylish shell on machines that were heavy and cumbrous , they suddenly found themselves dealing with machines that were almost laughably small in relation to the tasks that they could perform. // These were circumstances in which , as between product and consumer , a whole new mode of courtship had to be devised . Bellini had two very good ideas as to how this should be done . He had looked at contemporary sculpture , and he knew that its precise and often evocative forms corresponded to something in the climate of the times . Those forms had had to come along , in art . Why shouldn ' t they come along in design , as well ? The cube as maneuvered by Tony Smith , the phallic artillery as evolved by Alexander Liberman , the strange rearing shapes utilized by Anthony Caro in his table sculptures - all of these could be adjusted and adapted , together with fancies that were Bellini ' s own. // In itself , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial architecture after World War II , but many were the designers who took from him in the years that followed . Mondrian ' s images have been pirated by designers since the day they left his studio . Where Bellini went a stage further was in his ability to give something of human personality to his dashboards , calculators and office chairs. // Everyone had tried his hand at making a good office chair , but it was Bellini who realized that the chair could be just as prettily dressed as the young woman who would have to sit on it . His " Figura " office chair of 1979-84 came with upholstery that simulated a red shirt , a black belt and a red skirt . To look at it was to realize that office life need not be a penance. // As will be clear from this example , Bellini believes that an age of high technology need not necessarily be impersonal , let alone anesthetized to human feeling . Just as Minimal art - contrary to what is often supposed - is rich in sensuous experience of an unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellini ' s hands the aspect of an extended forum for touching , pressing and stroking . How this may affect the people concerned is not for the critic to say , but it is beyond question that in producing the world ' s first lascivious adding machine Mario Bellini took the boredom out of mathematics once and for all. // In case this might seem to be an isolated reaction , I must quote from the catalogue of the show , which was written by Cara McCarty , its curator . Speaking of the Divisumma 18 Electronic Printing Calculator of 1972 , she says that " because the calculator is portable and intended to be hand-held , Bellini personalized it through an inventive use of form and materials . What is especially intriguing is the continuous , flexible , rubber-skin keyboard . The skin , which protects the machine from dust , is anthropomorphically suggestive . Articulated pushbuttons , covered with the soft rubber skin , are like nipples . The emphasis is not on calculating and power , but on stimulating a sense of pleasure . Emotive responses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an irresistible artifact . One can not help but want to hold it , touch it , play with it. " // Visitors will also take Ms. McCarty ' s point when she tells them that the " Cab " side-chair of 1976 is " ' dressed ' entirely in leather , zipped together at the legs like boots . " It is almost a relief , to judge from the catalogue , that neither the Thermos of 1963 nor the " Robot " rotating antenna of 1980 has any overt erotic implication . We need to rest up from time to time . Besides , what stays with us longest is not so much the emotive element , arresting as that is , as the originality and the wit with which even the most familiar objects have been rethought and redesigned . Who else but Bellini would have designed an armchair that reminds us of the lightweight frame of a pair of eyeglasses ? This visitor cherishes , likewise , the notion of the " Temptation " armchair , designed for Cassina in 1973 , in which Bellini works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring . " If this is contemporary design , long may it continue . ( Through Sept. 15 at the Museum of Modern Art. ) //
