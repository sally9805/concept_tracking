It appears that , if we manage to avoid blowing each other off the face of the earth , Americans are headed for a even longer and older age . Last week , the National Center for Health Statistics added yet another year to theaverage life span . Those born in this country in 1982 , can expect to live 74 1/2 years . This is not exactly a news flash . We ' ve known for some time that the country is getting older . Even the number of people over 85 is expected to double in the next 20 years to some four million . Yet , it seems to me that our life span is expanding far more rapidly than our understanding of how to live it . We don ' t quite know how to be or become old . At times we seem stuck between images . We have a favorite fantasy of the perfect ending . Like Emerson ' s famous one-horse shay , we would live to a ripe old age with our faculties intact - though perhaps we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then mercifully and gracefully die in our sleep . We also have a nightmare of poverty , illness and loneliness . A portrait of this nightmare appeared in the Globe just this morning in a United Way plea , captioned : " When you ' re older you ' ll know what it ' s like . The countless hours alone . The phone that never rings . The children who are so busy with their own lives . " It ' s no wonder that we get so trapped between fears and fantasies that we are unable to deal rationally with aging . We either deny it or surrender to it . For that reason , I am grateful that B.F. Skinner has gotten old before I have . I am grateful that the behavioral psychologist who created the Skinner Box for children has come out of the closet of the aged . " I ' m an old man , " says the 79-year-old man , " I am old , old , old . " What Skinner has done with his old-old-old-ness is to write a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from its large print to its main points , is as direct as the title : " Enjoy Old Age , A Program of Self- Management . " He doesn ' t rage against his years , nor does he extoll their wonders . He quite simply suggests that we " attack old age as a problem to be solved . " Skinner names the problems as only an old person writing to his contemporaries can do comfortably . Old people ( he dislikes such phrases as " older " and " elderly " because they are evasive ) are likely to have trouble seeing , hearing , tasting , moving and remembering as well as they used to . Skinner himself relates the time he ate an entire hard-boiled egg , shell and all , believing it was an exotic Chinese appetizer . He retains in his old age , blessedly , a sense of humor . But as a good behaviorist , a man who believes in the power of the environment to shape people , he and his co-author set about solving the problems by changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not enjoying your life , something must be wrong with you . More often , something is wrong with the world in which you live . " The book is , as the authors admit , " not a scientific treatise . It is more like friendly advice . " The friendly advice runs from hints on remembering names , to admonitions against turning into a bore or a backseat driver . But the overall point is vintage Skinner : " You must find or create a world in which you can act in a sensible way . " Some of the parcels of advice will sound familiar or even mundane . There are sentences that turn into aphorisms : " The more reason we have to pay attention to life , the less we have to pay attention to death . . . . The nothing-to-do of boredom is nothing- you-want-to-do . . . . Make allowances for the allowances that are being made for you as an old person . " The authors talk little about the real problems of illness , poverty , loneliness , little about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act in a sensible way . " But for a people who waver between rank pessimism and fairy-tale fantasies about old age , this is a wonderfully refreshing treatment . Despite , or perhaps because of , the frankness about the potential problems of age , it is fundamentally optimistic about the human condition . In a deceptively simply way , Skinner insists that the majority of us can learn to manage our environment to make life better . If we can adjust to old age , we can adjust our everyday worlds to age and enjoy more of it . That ' s not a bad thought to remember for a lifespan of 74 1/2 years .
