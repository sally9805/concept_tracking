 | Dreamgirls is such an outwardly sensational Broadway musical that it 's possible to miss the power , irony and complexity of its inner meanings . As he did in " A Chorus Line , " director-choreographer Michael Bennett has put such orchestrated exultation , such sensuous force , such rocketing energy onstage that some people will think there 's nothing going on underneath all that fabulous jazz . But there is . " Dreamgirls " is a stunning and stirring show . What stuns you is the staging ? thunderously the best that the American theater can muster at this moment . What stirs you is the impassioned intelligence , compounded by Bennett from Tom Eyen 's shrewd book and lyrics , Henry Krieger 's varied and vivid score , Robin Wagner 's metamorphic set design , Tharon Musser 's wizardly lighting , Theoni V. Aldredge 's luscious and witty costumes , and the acting , singing and dancing of a knockout cast largely made up of new or littleknown names . Bennett and his gifted team have taken the story of a black singing group ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sharp sense of the contradictions , as well as the sheer excitement , of this American success story . The show wastes not a second in coming right at you . There 's no overture ; the curtain goes up and we 're backstage at Harlem 's famous Apollo Theater in the early ' 60s . It 's the weekly talent contest , and the stage seethes and swarms with people , including most of the main characters whom we 'll follow for a decade . This first scene is breath-taking in the headlong rush and absolute clarity of its action , as Robin Wagner 's metallic light towers and bridges glide and pivot across the stage , inflecting the space with instant and infinite variety : at one moment we 're watching an act onstage at the Apollo , at the next we 're backstage , at the next we 're at a Degas-like angle so that we can see what 's going on in both places at once . The technique is dazzling in itself , but it also serves a deeper purpose , suggesting the shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " A Chorus Line , " is both life and a metaphor for Life . The Dreamettes , three young , innocent , eager girls from a Chicago ghetto , collide with other dreams and other dreamers . Most important is Curtis , a hustler and hanger-on who senses the moment has come for black talent to " cross over " into the white popular culture . Just as Berry Gordy did with his Motown records and singers like the Supremes , Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye , Curtis latches on to the Dreamettes , renames them the Dreams and creates a new sound , style and look for them , diluting their blackness to appeal to the white market . Conflicts : This dilution is brilliantly conveyed by every element in the show ? from the music to the succession of wigs the girls wear , starting with the tacky perukes they don at the Apollo and climaxed by the Babylonian creations they sport when they model fashions for Vogue magazine . But there 's more than wigs , dresses and even musical style involved . " Dreamgirls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dreams become a glamorous ambiguity , irrevocably black and mimetically white , a point symbolized when they appear in blazingly white gowns with white flowers in their hair that suggest the flowers worn by Billie Holiday , the great and tragic black singer who never crossed the cultural color line . Bennett dramatizes the conflicts and ambiguities of black ambition and compromise  | in a white culture through a driving pulse of pure entertainment . " Cadillac Car " is a sardonic anthem in which Curtis portrays the luxury car as a status symbol for Americans from " the pure . unstained Wasps " to Jews to blacks . In the title song . the Dreams embrace both their own dream of superstar success and the romantic and erotic dreams of their listeners . In a stunning , show-stopping number . " Steppin ' to the Bad Side , " Curtis and his cohorts sing and dance the necessity of chiseling tactics like payola ; Bennett here captures not only the whiff of corruption but the perverse exhilaration of corruption . These songs , and others like the torchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatricalized shapings of the classic Motown sound , the crossover conflation of rhythm and blues and pop . But there 's more to the musical texture of " Dreamgirls " than the songs . As the dramatic texture deepens in the first act , the show shifts into a musical overdrive : the spoken dialogue becomes powerfully sung recitative . The climax of this operatic mode comes when Curtis forces Effie , the Dreams ' lead singer , out of the group and out of his life ( just as Berry Gordy forced Florence Ballard out of the Supremes ) . As Effie , 21-year-old Jennifer Holliday sings " And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going , " a long , tortured supplication to her heartless lover , in which Holliday 's voice and body enact every nuance of anguish and determination . Maria Callas herself would have admired this devastating . fusion of singing and acting . Manipulations : Holliday is extraordinary , but so is the entire youthful cast . Cleavant Derricks gives perhaps the best all-around performance as James ( Thunder ) Early , the James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulations . ( Derricks is also responsible for the.superb vocal arrangements . ) Ben Harney is sleek and satanic as Curtis . Obba Babatunde as Effie 's song-writing brother and Vondie Curtis-Hall as Early 's frozenout manager are full of vibrant sincerity . Sheryl Lee Ralph is gorgeous and affecting as Deena , the Diana Ross-like figure who becomes the Dreams ' superstar ; Loretta Devine is just as gorgeous and affecting as the innocent Lorrell , who grows up fast , and Deborah Burrell adds more beauty and style as Michelle , the final Dream who resists being a variation on a theme . " Dreamgirls " is n't perfect . As tough and knowing as it is , it ca n't resist forcing a reconciliation between the Dreams and Effie rather than evoking the harsh reality that saw Florence Ballard descend through penury and defeat to death at 32 . But then reconciliation , between black and white , success and authenticity , is where we must head if we 're going to survive . To call Dreamgirls " the best musical of the season is a weasely yap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent contribution to our musical theater . NEWSWEEK/JANUARY 4 , 1982
