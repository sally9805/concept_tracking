The snicker factor hurts . The idea of Nancy Reagan adorned with a turban hurts . By writing his kick-and-tell book , Don Regan resembles a Greek god who personifies one raw human emotion with absolute purity and unmistakable clarity . His is pure spite . Don Regan not only gives kiss-and-tell books a bad name . He gives the Reagan presidency a bad name . And he helps discredit the ideas that made it work . For nothing constructive . For pure spite . Oscar Wilde said every great man has at least 12 disciples , but it is usually Judas who writes the memoirs . Reagan has loads of disciples and more than 12 Judases , beginning with Alexander Haig and David Stockman . Just as AIDS turned the national focus off herpes , so Regan ended the national chatter over Larry Speakes ' book . The more America snickers at the Reagans , the easier Reaganism is to dismiss . The larger the " Bozo factor " becomes-with the menagerie of astrologers , Michael Deaver , Regan and other wonders-the harder it is to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here again . Take any measure-unemployment , inflation , direction in foreign policy-and we have loads for which to thank Nancy ' s lucky stars . Whatever unique management style Reagan practices , so be it . It ' s worked . We ' ve had eight years of peace and liberty . Our values of freedom and free enterprise are no longer on the run-they ' re on the march . Not a bad turnaround in one presidency . Yet Regan seeks to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory . He ' s out to deprive his one-time boss of history ' s glitter . It ' s infuriating that he does so , and it ' s infuriating how he does so-in the most vindictive way possible . After dismissing Deaver as " a born chamberlain , " for instance , Regan quotes Deaver as sloughing off the stars bit : " At least this astrologer is not as kooky as the last one . " Consoling words in the First Lady ' s defense . Regan ' s book is chock-a-block with such nasty morsels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to have manners . He writes in the book ' s foreward : " Out of deference to the office and the man , I have not enclosed language attributed to the President in quotation marks " except where it ' s already been in print . How gracious can a fellow be ? Regan was anything but gracious in the White House . Who else could have released-as the only photo doled out then-that classic pose of him leaning over the couch to counsel Reagan and Gorbachev during the first summit ? Regan ' s book editor said , " Don Regan ' s reputation is not that of a lightweight or gossip . " Well , now it is . His scorched-earth policy toward Nancy blots out any constructive purpose a decent memoir could have served . And a decent memoir could have served one . It ' s a precious commodity . Dean Acheson set the standard with " Present at the Creation . " Published nearly 20 years after he and the president he served left office , it was high on substance , low on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boss . The quintessence of the Eastern Establishment could not have been kinder to the cussing haberdasher from Missouri , Harry Truman . Had Regan followed Acheson ' s model , he could have told how the President managed to set the agenda of the 1980s . How ideas have consequences . How conservatives must put forward their ideas unabashedly if they are to govern for long . How their ideas can never be defeated in battle ; they can only lose by forsaking battle . Now it ' s up to others to assume Don Regan ' s description of his task as White House chief of staff : " Some of us are like a shovel brigade that follows a parade down Main Street cleaning up . . . . " Historians now must clean up after Don Regan and tell what a fine presidency Reagan ' s really was for Main Street , America .
