" Reporters , " former Senator Eugene McCarthy once remarked , " are like blackbirds on a telephone wire . One flies off , they all fly off . One flies back , they all fly back . " That view of journalism , however unfair , is widely held even among journalists . It has become commonplace self-criticism that news organizations tend to converge on a social trend , stir up alarm , then lose interest in unison and move on to some other concern . Last week a debate heated up about whether the media have collectively hyped the nation 's drug problem , especially the threat posed by crack , a potent form of cocaine . At the forefront was an unlikely critic of media warnings about illegal narcotics : the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration . <P> Crack has dominated media attention during the recent surge in drug coverage . A CBS report televised in early September , 48 Hours on Crack Street , drew the highest viewership of any network documentary in six years . NBC has aired more than 400 reports on drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago highlighted drugs on all its news programs . Cocaine and crack have been front-page news in dailies ranging from city tabloids to the Wall Street Journal , which last week reported abuse was " rife " in rural Oklahoma . Crack has repeatedly reached Page One of the New York Times and Washington Post , and the drug crisis rated two cover stories within three months at Newsweek . The magazine 's editor in chief , Richard Smith , wrote in the June 16 issue : " An epidemic is abroad in America , as pervasive and dangerous in its way as the plagues of medieval times . " TIME has given cover attention to drug use in the workplace and the antidrug crusade led by President and Mrs. Reagan . But the DEA , after a city-by-city survey of crack 's availability , asserted in a report that the result of media attention " has been a distortion of the public perception of the extent of crack use . " <P> The DEA said the drug " generally is not available " in some major cities , * including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely available in many other metropolitan areas . In addition , contrary to some news reports , the DEA found little evidence that crack use had spread from inner cities to many suburbs . The study concluded , " Crack presently appears to be a secondary rather than primary problem in most areas . " Ironically , the DEA report received little coverage : it did not make the CBS or the ABC network newscasts that night , was passed up by the New York Times and ran on page 18 in the Washington Post the next day . <P> While the DEA was focusing on crack , some news organizations were questioning whether the entire drug-abuse story has been receiving too much attention . The New Republic ran a cover story billed " Confessions of a Drug- Hype Junkie , " written by Adam Paul Weisman , a researcher at U.S. News &; World Report who worked on that magazine 's July 28 cover story about drug abuse . Weisman charged other publications with " blatant sensationalism " for having ignored statistics indicating there is no boom in drug experimentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he noted , has been oscillating between 16% and 17% since 1981.
