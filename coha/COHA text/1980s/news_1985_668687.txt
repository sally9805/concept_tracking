Beatrice Companies Inc. made it official Thursday : It accepted a sweetened offer by the investment firm of Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Co. to buy the Chicago-based company for more than $5 billion . The biggest leveraged buyout in history is expected to be completed Feb. 28 . Sources close to Beatrice said details of lucrative guarantees for top Beatrice executives had been worked out , but details were withheld . Beatrice granted the new Kohlberg Kravis Corp. an option , exercisable under certain circumstances , to buy either the company ' s grocery group and Tropicana units for $2. 391 billion or the Tropicana , meat , soft-drink and bottled-water businesses for $2. 412 billion . That lock-up provision is intended to dissuade any other potential suitor from coming in with an alternative bid for Beatrice , because New York-based Kohlberg Kravis would be guaranteed some of the plums of Beatrice . Kohlberg Kravis has commitments from three major New York banks to form a bank syndicate to provide a portion of the financing for the transaction and has been advised by Drexel Burnham Lambert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of the required debt financing . William W. Granger Jr . , Beatrice chairman and chief executive , called the deal " an excellent transaction for our shareholders " and said that Kohlberg Kravis intends to keep the company as a " major and growing enterprise headquartered in Chicago , which will continue to provide our employees with challenging and rewarding careers . " Henry Kravis , partner in the firm , said : " Beatrice is a strong company with excellent management and a fine record . We look forward to working with Beatrice and helping make it an even stronger enterprise . " The Beatrice board spurned an 11th-hour bid by Dart Group Corp. , a diversified Bethesda , Md. - based company that owns Crown Books , and its investment adviser , E.F. Hutton &; Co . The group reportedly had offered to buy Beatrice for $48 a share in cash . Daniel Good , Hutton ' s mergers chief , confirmed that Dart had discussions with Beatrice , but he wouldn ' t disclose any details . Kohlberg Kravis ' revised bid is for $43 in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kohlberg Kravis reportedly raised its bid after meeting Tuesday with Beatrice management . In mid-October , Kohlberg Kravis offered $40 in cash and preferred stock with a market value of $5 to buy Beatrice . Two weeks later , after its unsolicited leveraged buyout offer was rejected as " inadequate " by Beatrice , Kohlberg Kravis bumped up its offer to $40 in cash and securities with a market value of $7 . Kohlberg Kravis is no stranger to major leveraged buyouts . A leveraged buyout usually consists of a management team acquiring a company with financing largely provided by borrowing . Ultimately , the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired firm ' s operations or sale of its assets . Donald Kelly , Kohlberg Kravis ' choice as Beatrice ' s chief executive , is intimately familiar with Beatrice , because he ran Esmark Inc. before Beatrice acquired it two years ago . As one drama ended , another began , based on speculation as to what would happen to Beatrice under Kelly . Sources believe he will tap Frederick Rentschler , former Esmark executive who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head Beatrice ' s U.S. Foods division . Joel Smilow , former president of Playtex International , will return to his old post , sources said . Roger Briggs , Kelly ' s partner at both Esmark and the firm they founded , Kelly Briggs &; Associates Inc. , is expected to be the chief financial officer . Lucrative " golden parachutes " were believed to have been worked out for members of Beatrice ' s top management , including executive vice presidents David Lipson , chief financial officer , and Richard Pigott , chief administrative officer , who failed in their own leveraged buyout attempt last month . While Kohlberg Kravis had said it would keep Beatrice intact , Wall Street sources have widely agreed that the new firm would sell off many of Beatrice ' s nonfood units to help pay off its debt . Beatrice ' s Avis Inc. has already been put on the block , along with three lesser subsidiaries . The turmoil at Beatrice can be traced to the agreement it reached with Esmark in June , 1984 , under then-Chairman James L. Dutt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped down . Through the next 15 months , Dutt presided over a firm that was marked by a steady exit of top management through firings , resignations and retirements . After Dutt ' s dismissal in August , Kohlberg Kravis surfaced as a suitor . Kelly was chosen to head the firm and reportedly was kicking in $25 million . During the turmoil and speculation , Beatrice stock steadily rose , from $33 a share in late August to a high of $47 . Recently the stock has slipped , but late Thursday , it was trading at $46. 12 , up 62 cents from Wednesday ' s close
