Seatrain Lines goes bankrupt <P> Seatrain Lines , a troubled cargo-ship operator , would have foundered years ago without the aid of a friendly and very wealthy benefactor : the U.S. Government . While an emotional national debate erupted over $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees for Chrysler , Seatrain has quietly received nearly $450 million in Government financial assistance since 1972 . Despite the federal largesse , however , Seatrain last week finally ran on the rocks . Three Italian companies who together were owed more than $1 million by Seatrain pushed it into bankruptcy proceedings . <P> Seatrain 's problems began in 1969 , when it started constructing large oil tankers at New York 's old Brooklyn Navy Yard . Although the company had no shipbuilding experience , the U.S. Maritime Administration provided $100 million in construction subsidies for the shipbuilding , as well as loan guarantees for most of the remaining costs . <P> The shipbuilding effort very quickly became a disaster . The inexperienced workers pushed up labor costs at exactly the same time that the market for oil supertankers was dying , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for crude , and thus for crude carriers . Seatrain was forced to sell two of its vessels in 1973 at sacrifice prices . The remaining two sat idle or were chartered for less profitable short hauls for three years before they were eventually used to carry crude from Alaska 's North Slope . <P> In 1975 Seatrain decided to close the shipyard , but then another Government agency , the Economic Development Administration , stepped in with $50 million in loans to keep it operating . <P> Meanwhile , Seatrain 's container freight operation was falling apart in a whirl of scandals and bad business . The firm had to pay the Government nearly $1 million in penalties for making kickbacks to shippers and about $500,000 for unpaid import duties . <P> During the fourth quarter of last year , Seatrain 's losses totaled more than $150 million . When bankruptcy papers were filed in a New York court last week , the company , which had shrunk to just 550 employees , owed an estimated $200 million to some 3,500 creditors around the world , including $150 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with another approximately $335 million in outstanding loans and loan guarantees , may be the Federal Government .
