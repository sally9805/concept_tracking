The harvest falls short again <P> Food shortages are an irksome hallmark of daily life in the Soviet Union . <P> But this year the problems have come earlier and will last longer . Even in Moscow , the best supplied city in the country , shops are feeling the pinch , and many meat and vegetable counters are empty . In his economic report to the Party Central Committee last week , Leonid Brezhnev warned that the situation may get even worse . Although this year 's wheat harvest was big enough to ensure the production of the 46 million tons of grain needed for Soviet citizens ' annual consumption of bread , there may be precious little meat to go with it . Reason : the total grain harvest will fall far short of the 235-million-ton target , thereby causing severe shortages of livestock feed . This year 's harvest is expected to yield only 181 million tons , just 2 million tons more than last year 's total and well below the record 237 million tons produced in 1978 . Soviet officials had said earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons . <P> The U.S.S.R. once again will have to go shopping for grain on the international market . If Washington continues its embargo , Moscow will be able to buy only 8 million tons from the U.S. , under a bilateral grain agreement that remains in force until next September . Though the Soviets may be able to import as much grain as they did last year , when they made big purchases from Argentina and Canada , the experts believe that Moscow will still suffer a severe shortfall . <P> Even as Brezhnev was delivering his gloomy report , the U.S. and China were signing a four-year agreement that calls for the U.S. to supply the Chinese with between 6 million and 9 million tons of wheat and corn annually . The Chinese thus became a $1-billion-to $1.5-billion-a-year grain customer at a time when American farmers were complaining about the losses caused by the embargo to the Soviets-as Candidate Jimmy Carter was well aware . <P> In his report to the Central Committee , Brezhnev candidly discussed the " difficulties " of the Soviets ' cumbersome distribution system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for increasing the production of goods and services for the population . " One sign that the leadership takes the consumer seriously : the swift elevation of Mikhail Gorbachev , agriculture czar since 1978 , to full membership in the Politburo last week . At 49 , Gorbachev becomes its youngest member . Some experts believe that the Kremlin is digesting the lesson of Poland and wants to damp down potential discontent . Soviet citizens consume only 70% as much meat as the Poles , who went on strike over their own shortage .
