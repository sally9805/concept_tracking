ABC 's Viewpoint puts correspondents on the firing line <P> Network television offers disgruntled audiences no outlet as effective as a newspaper 's Op-Ed page , or even a correction box . Yet the need for access of dissenting views may be greater in TV news than in print journalism . The time for nightly network coverage is minimal , the emotional impact often maximal . Inevitably , many stories are excluded and others oversimplified . <P> All three networks have tried to open their programs to angry advocates and ordinary citizens . NBC has quoted viewer letters on NBC Magazine and Meet the Press . CBS has aired letters too , and last year had its 60 Minutes reporters examine on air their own reporting techniques .

The subject : coverage of foreign affairs . Correspondent John Laurence opened on a skeptical note , calling network correspondents " jet-age ambulance chasers . " Koppel closed with a warning that globe-girdling TV technology has given Americans " the illusion that we are familiar with distant places and cultures . " <P> In the segments between , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts in a report on alleged Israeli mistreatment of Palestinians living in the West Bank , Correspondent Tom Jarriel failed to answer specific charges ; rather , he aggressively interrupted his questioner , Howard Squadron of the American-Jewish Committee , until Koppel rebuked him . Said Koppel : " I think it 'll be most useful to everyone if Mr. Squadron is given an opportunity to make his points , Tom . " London-based Anchor Peter Jennings answered a question about the Falkland Islands dispute with a lame joke that the unmentioned " pawns " in the situation were the Falklanders ' sheep .
