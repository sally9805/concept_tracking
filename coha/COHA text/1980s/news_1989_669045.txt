New World New Mind Moving Toward Conscious Evolution By Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich Doubleday , 302 pages , $18. 95 To most laymen the subject of human evolution has long been a complex , disturbing affair frequently causing disbelief-or worse , indifference . In " New World New Mind , " Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich set out to make our biological and cultural origins a fundamental part of knowing ourselves . This in itself would be ambitious , but the book has an even wider purpose : not only to realize the limits of our perceptions , but to begin consciously to develop new ones as a way of securing the future . The future they see is increasingly threatened by such time bombs as overpopulation , AIDS , the depletion of natural resources and environmental stress . These threats are made more difficult to solve by the fact that " our reactions to the modern world are often inappropriate because of the nature of our minds and the training we give them . " What does all this have to do with evolution ? Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less unchanged in the last hundred thousand , developed strategies to deal with the relatively stable environment of our ancient ancestors , which demanded fast and adaptive response to sudden change , and because of this hair-trigger timing of our nervous systems , it ' s difficult for us to perceive gradual but more significant threats . This leaves us afflicted by the " boiled frog syndrome " : A frog put in a container of water that is being heated slowly can not sense the lethal change-it will sit there till it dies . While it may not be flattering to think of ourselves as being cooked in our own technologies , this is what is happening . " Human inventiveness has created problems because human judgment and humanity ' s ability to deal with the consequences of its creations lags behind its ability to create . " Ornstein and Ehrlich insist that this mismatch between our biological and cultural development is at the heart of our most serious problems , and they spend a great deal of time describing the ways the world has slipped from our grasp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost at random . Why , for instance , do we need a disaster like the recent Alaskan oil spill to begin to consider the safety of oil tankers ? There are hundreds of oil spills every year that never reach public awareness because they ' re not " dramatic " enough . The authors create a strong sense of urgency without ever becoming shrill . Whether discussing the environment , AIDS , or our daily spiritual and psychological blunders , the book never wanders far from its roots in our evolutionary past . At the same time it continues to look deeply into the future with a remarkable combination of common sense and vision . As for solutions , Ornstein and Ehrlich recommend " conscious evolution " : Familiarizing ourselves with the knowledge built up in the sciences over the last 50 years about how we judge and misjudge the world . They call for new educational curricula to give us the flexibility to think and learn beyond our present limitations . To be well-informed , on its most basic level , means to be well-informed about oneself , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another and to the planet . Until we attain this level of consciousness , the world will continue to be out of our control.
