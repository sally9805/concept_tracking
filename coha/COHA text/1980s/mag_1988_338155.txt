The pairing seems about as likely as a business lunch between Author Germaine Greer and Pop Singer Tiffany : Ms. , the feminist bible born of the political turmoil of the 1960s , and Sassy , the impudent primer for the latest generation of boy-crazy teenage girls . But Sassy Founder Sandra Yates and Ms. Editor Anne Summers are betting that the two magazines will be the foundation of a new media empire . Last week the two transplanted Australians signed a deal to buy Ms. and Sassy from their former employer , Australia 's John Fairfax Ltd . <P> Fairfax 's decision to sell the two magazines represents an abrupt about- face . It was only a year ago that the company , which is Australia 's second largest publishing concern , dispatched Yates to the U.S. to create Sassy , an American version of Fairfax 's fabulously successful Australian teen magazine Dolly . Last September , upon hearing that Ms. Founders Gloria Steinem and Patricia Carbine were looking for a new source of funding , Yates persuaded her Australian bosses to buy the magazine for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminist historian and former chief of Fairfax 's New York bureau , as editor . <P> But just as Sassy and the new Ms. were hitting the newsstands , Warwick Fairfax , the company 's 27-year-old chief , decided to sell his fledgling American subdivision . At that point , Yates exercised an option to buy the two magazines . Yates and Summers are reluctant to disclose details of the purchase , but they insist that their backers , which include the State Bank of New South Wales and a major U.S. bank , have provided their new company , Matilda Publishing , with enough cash to get through the start-up period . <P> They will need it . Although a trailblazer when it was founded in 1972 , Ms. ( circ. 485,000 ) has never been a financial success . Advertisers have always been cool to the magazine , and " the editorial voice failed to move with the times , " says Yates . In an effort " to reflect the pragmatism of women as they move into the 1990s , " Yates and Summers embarked on an expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less cluttered design . <P> Freed from editorial restrictions placed on it when it was published by a tax-exempt foundation , Ms. now features political coverage and a revamped news section . Current articles stress solid reporting and are deliberately less doctrinaire . " Ms. approaches the world with ' feminist ' assumptions , but it does n't mean we use the word in every sentence , " says Summers . Despite these changes , the new Ms. is still in transition . " We are neither a workingwoman 's magazine nor a traditional woman 's magazine , nor a fashion magazine , " declares Summers , unwittingly leaving the impression that she is far more certain about what Ms. is not than what it is.
