Year after year the American Grayhound Derby at the Taunton Dog Track attracts some of the best greyhounds throughout the US . Many say that dogmen respond to the American Deby as a favor to Taunton ' s Chairman of the Board , Joseph M. Linsey , one of the founding fathers of the greyhound industry in the US and a man whom many feel they owe a debt of gratitude for all his efforts on behalf of dog racing . This year is no exception . The 32d running of the $35,000 headliner , scheduled for Sunday night , Oct. 25 , has drawn every top- route racer in the country . " It ' s without doubt the most impressive field of greyhounds ever assembled at the track for one race , " said Taunton ' s exective vice president Alfred Ross . " We have 41 outside dogs coming for the race out of the 64 that will begin qualifying races tomorrow afternoon and night and we even had 10 more entries than we could accommodate . Those 10 dogs have been put on standby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64 starters have to be withdrawn . " Keith Dillon ' s 1980 champion , Position , will be back to defend his title in an attempt to give the Olathe , Kan. , native his third American Derby winner . Dillon ' s Abella won the 1974 edition . Nicholas Labit ' s Labit ' s Frederic , winner of the $50,000 Rhode Island Derby and a finalist in the Wonderland Derby won by Francis Fulginiti ' s Minstrel Kid , will also start .

( Happy ) Stutz Kennel in Taunton ' s most prestigious race . " I see no way that Unruly won ' t be named Greyhound of the Year , " said Taunton ' s Ross as he reeled off the names of the six major stakes races around the country in which Unruly has been a finalist this year . " When you consider the number of qualifying races that are required to make the final of some big races , his reaching the final six times in itself is a miracle . " Unruly , who won the $100,000 Hollywoodian Stakes in Florida earlier this year , finished second to Labit ' s Frederick in the Rhode Island Derby and fourth in the Wonderland Derby after meeting trouble throughout . He ran second by a nose in last week ' s$100,000 Biscayne Derby after getting roughed up badly on the turn .
