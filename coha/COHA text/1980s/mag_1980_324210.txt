The Young County jail in Graham , Texas , is remarkably unconfining . In the past two years 16 inmates have escaped . The record-at least for two-man escapes - is held by Jeffrey Lamb , 18 , and David Bowman , 20 , who were arrested last August on charges of burglary , attempted murder and car theft . <P> In October they escaped by scuttling under a fence in the exercise yard . Recaptured , they squirmed to freedom in December through air-conditioning vents . They were caught again but broke out this month through a supposedly shatterproof glass window . <P> They were captured a third time and sent to the more secure Dallas County jail . Says Young County District Attorney Boyd Richie of his lockup : " The only way to fix it is to bulldoze it . "
