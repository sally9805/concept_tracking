Scene 1 . A waiting room in a rural bus station . A block of lockers up left . An open door up right with a view of an open field and a starry night . The silver MAN stands in the shadows with only his legs visible . A GIRL with green hair enters with two immense suit-cases . She stops , lowers them to the floor , and pauses . She unwraps a stick of gum and slips it in her mouth . For a long time she is expressionless . It is as if she senses the presence of the MAN , but is unsure of what to do . A big grin appears on her face . She whistles a snatch of a song . She stops and we hear the night wind in the trees outside . GIRL I dreamed I had a wicked sister Pause.She was a girl Hun . She rode her pony , up there in the sky . She rode across the vast empty spaces the sky is filled with . Across millions of miles of empty sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom it . A whole horde of girl Huns rode with her , harrying all the meek ones of the outer worlds . They wore only rags ; bows and arrows were their weapons . They obeyed no laws and had no rules . For nourishment , they dug up disgusting roots and ate them raw . They laid strips of raw meat on their ponies ' back , under the saddle as they rode . Slap , slap , slap . This makes the meat soft . My sister , she was the leader of the girl Huns . In the horde all are equal . Except the Shanyu , my sister , who was a little more equal . The Shanyu interpreted the will of Tengri , god of the girl Huns . Slap , slap , slap , as they rode . Their eyes shine bright as balefire in the dark , in the empty reaches of outer space . Their flag is a bent stick with nine foxtails nailed to it . Tengri is the only god , and my wicked sister is the Shanyu . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ride !

GIRL Right Long pause . The MAN FROM THE BUS COMPANY enters and delivers his monologue . BUS MAN Ladies and gentlemen , the Amalgamated Odd Fellows Bus Company of Grayways , Iowa , is sorry to report we have canceled the 1:00 A.M. for Grayways and points west . Ladies and gents , we are most sad to inform you the bus in question has done blowed up and is no more . Furthermore , folks , we are plumb wore out and would like to call it a day , but owing to the problem with the , ah , aforementioned bus , mysteriously , spontaneously combusted out by the dump near Milwacky , we are stuck , like you , in this dustbowl shithole till Lord knows when . Christ , it 's enough to push a sane man to drink , and a drinking man plumb over the edge into the purlieus of outright insobidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence no man has returned , but in the shackles of the mad , screaming bloody murder , gibbering fit to kill , in Lower Malarkey , or Glossolalia , language of the doomed . And , further , there ai n't no bus to Crow , Port Tobacco , Loyalsock , Baraboo , Washington , Salem , Cheecago , Webster , Troy , Utica , Carthage , Beanbag , Thorpe , Hog Eye , Noodle , Oblong , Santa Claus , Rabbit Hash , Bumblebee , Wink , Zigzag , Jackass Gulch , Gouge , Hang Town , Bug , Humbug Flat , Defeated , Raccoon , Okay , Custard , Brindle , Dead Man , Horsetail , nor to Puppytown , by ways of Centipede , Paint Pot , One-Eye , Puke , and Rattrap , nor through Chucklehead , Shinbone , Dead Mule , Ground Hog 's Glory and Poverty Hill , where nothing do n't grow no more owning to a radioactive constitution of stroobontium seepage down there , deep in the ground-water thing ' Cause , like I say , the bus done blowed up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no more . Pause.However , you can take your ticket to Grayways and apply for a refund but , just between you and me , I would n't bother , ' cause it 's a waste of time , aside from which how you gon na get there in the first place without you got no wheels , and me , I tell you , the first thing I do on payday is cash my check quick because it 's like the Good Book says : do n't count your chickens before saving up for a rainy day , and seeing as how today is payday , I 'm henceforth outta here Goo'night , ladies , goo'night , gents . If by chance another bus do come by , tell ' em Fred is dead , and watch out for that fatal , itchiferous , insidious insobidy and praise the Lord . Pause.Now there just might be a bus show up for Elmer . Elmer , or Waltraut , Sphinx , Erika , Argentina , Thule , 1940 W-L , Hay , Kutuzov , Murakami , Ahti , Ops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teucer , Vanderlinden , Goethe , Alex , Khufu , Bus , Hus , Kosmodemyanskaya , Galahad , Smithers , Beer , Shao , Lick , 1931 PH , Ethiopia , Thais , Galatea , Hedwerthia , Tyche , Isis , Amphitrite , Metus , Vala , or Hohensteina . Just imagine taking the bus to Bus You think on that , kind gentlefolk , but I would n't count on it . Why ? you ask . Them places are not on no map neither , them places are up in the night sky . Least how it 's rumored they are Strange , a bus to Bus ! Goo'night , sweet prince , goo'night , ladies . Starts to go out , stops , and looks at them sternly.You two look funny . Weird . Strange . Foreign . Not from here . People like you , people not from here , people who do n't belong here , that 's for sure . They take their life in their own hand , and they have a fool for a doctor . Exits through the open door upstage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collapses under the starry sky . p. 10 GIRL Are you sure you do n't want to know who I am ? Pause.Shit . I asked you . I demeaned myself . Fuck . MAN Surfaces are obscure . GIRL You 're not really human , are you ! ? Wowee ! Great ! Splendid . You 're wonderful ! What are you ? Are you a machine ? A robot ? Are you going to kill me ? Let me see you do something weird . Please . Just one little piece of weirdness . Turn me into whatever you are . You 're a machine , I just know it ! The GIRL 's SISTER enters . SISTER Here you are , Michelle . Well , what have you got to say for yourself ? GIRL Go away , Jennifer . SISTER I have absolutely nothing to say to you , Michelle . MAN Blackout ! p. 11 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene two . The same . SISTER lectures GIRL . SISTER Michelle , Michelle . This is madness . Pause.I have absolutely nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . Have you ever considered , Michelle , the sheer amount of garbage , every day ? How long it took Grandfather to become rich ? Really . Do you imagine you are the only one ? With problems . Michelle . Can you imagine what I might be going through ? * Have you considered the past and future ? Have you given thought to sheer human stupidity ? The sky . The earth . The sea . Have you thought about the sea , and about what lies at the bottom of the sea ? Shipwrecks , Michelle . Ghostly , bloated , dead , the drowned . Thousands of them , with staring eyes , with starfish in the eye sockets , and coral in their waving hair , emerald hair . Green hair , like yours , Michelle . But they have at least earned their green hair by going down with the ship . They at least have fought the good fight , and the sea will never , never yield up their secret tragedy . You , on the other hand , are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body politic . You do not go to church , you do not send aid to the contras , you do not join the family in our choral readings of the New Republic . You are apathetic , you do not follow current events except from this insane perspective of radicalism , this insane PLO terrorist line you repeat to shock us , your father and mother , the cat and dog , all shocked but not surprised , Michelle . For you are bad seed , Michelle , the black sheep , pariah , outcast , the family failure , the disgrace , the wicked child , the ne'er-do-well , the satanic changeling I have always known this , but I tried to protect you from your evil nature , which is sick and vile and vicious ; and yes , I had my secret motives , too , for Mom and Dad would be crushed to know what a monster they had begotten and brought into this world and reared and nurtured with all their love , all unknowing . But I knew , even , yes , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not . Your associations among the dark underclass . Scandalous . The dead beats . Drug addicts . Perverts . Social undesirables and rejects . Losers , Michelle . Have you thought about the stock market ? Real estate ? The need to accumulate , heap up , hoard , and conserve ? Have you considered the feelings of your betrothed , North Mainwaring , who I warned against your aberrant , sick nature , though he would have none of it , being under the spell of your wiles , yes , I warned him it would come to this , while he could have had me , who understood his sensitive nature , and need to be alone , in the wilderness , for long periods of time , with ducks , and decoys , and guns . Have you thought about Smith College , about Bergdorf Goodman , have you considered our holidays at Key West , Lake Tahoe , the rough anfractious rocks off the coast of Maine , have you considered reputation , the bottom line , public morality , risk of AIDS through normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a horde of unsuitable partners , have you considered the fragility of credit , belief , trust , social glue ? God help us , Michelle , have you thought about money , hard-cash money ? Pause.You rotten-minded , little good-for-nothing slut . p. 12 GIRL ( Begins to overlap SISTER at* . ) This is my good sister , Jennifer . Jennifer , meet Xuphus . Xuphus , meet Jennifer . Jennifer is a normal American cunt . She ca n't stand the idea someone might not want to be like her . She hates anybody who is different , or looks different , or aspires to strange gods . She thinks the Arabs should unilaterally accept UN Resolution 242 . She thinks South Africa is America 's best friend in Africa . She believes in God , Somoza , Swaggart , and Margaret Thatcher . Look at her , Xuphus , she 's a closet religious maniac who wants to be reborn so badly she 'd blow the world up gladly . Pleasure is lost on her , simple fun means nothing to her . Human life horrifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her how much America is not doing SISTER 's tirade continues . GIRL puts up with it for a time , then:Drop dead , Jennifer . SISTERdrops dead . Pause . MAN Your mother , she is dropped dead as you commanded . GIRL She 's not my mother , she 's my sister . Wow ! MAN She talks to you like she is your mother . You often do this command to drop dead ? GIRL I was struck by lightning when I was a kid . Maybe I 'm special . p. 13 MAN Kids struck by lightning often have strange powers . GIRL She ca n't be dead . She was hardly alive . MAN A sensitive nature perhaps . GIRL She 's too shallow and materialistic to be dead . Pokes her SISTER with her foot . Pause.She sure looks dead . MAN I can feel the body cooling . GIRL Now what do I do ? Shit . Why did she have to follow me ? MAN I suggest we dispose of the body in one of the lockers . GIRL Good idea . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand ? MAN With pleasure . They stuff the body into one of the lockers , but are unable to secure the door . So SISTER 's feet protrude.Your mother is massive for such a slight frame . GIRL All the right-wing periodicals she used to read . Turns the brain to lead . MAN Such a happy people . Perhaps now you will teach me the secret of your happiness . GIRL You 're crazy . Go away and leave me alone . I 'm a murderer . Yikes . Now what am I going to do ? p. 14 MAN Persist . Then go out in silence . Like the rest of living things who must croak . Even the dung beetle persist . GIRL I do n't want to go out quietly . I want to make a loud noise . Pause.Are you really from outer space ? MAN From the sand world of Plinth , which was blown up in an accidental blast at the central fusion station , as I said . Then , like all my kind , I am in a perpetual pilgrimage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the asteroid belt . I travel much , frequent-flyer advantage . Bad joke . From Elmer to Roswitha , from Roswitha to Pia , from Pia to Wolfiana , from Wolfiana to Erda , from Erda to Helio , from Helio to 1935X , from 1935X to McCuskey , from McCuskey to Wild , from Wild to Whipple , from Whipple to Zu Chong-Zhi , from Zu Chong-Zhi to Zulu , from Zulu to CrAO , from CrAO to Sy , from Sy to Toro , from Toro to Kacheuvskaya , and from Kacheuvskaya back to you know where GIRL I have no idea . MAN Back to Elmer . And so on . Very tedious , but necessary to avoid what we call the madness of small worlds . Even so , it is hard . GIRL Are you for real ? MAN We want to learn why people are so happy on Terra. p. 15 GIRL YOU CALL THIS HAPPY ! ? MAN On our world , Elmer , remnant of Plinth , we are very doleful , dour , sad . GIRL I have an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sex is sad , as I have explained . GIRL Boy , does she ever look dead . Pause.Jennifer , oh Jennifer . Pause.Do you have a cigarette ? MAN I am not smoking . Pause.It is forbidden on Elmer . As on Fanny , Voloshina , Wirt , Bistro , Scobee , Durer , and Vondel . It is , however , permitted on Niepce , Redddish , Karin , Kron , Goto , Tuulikki , 2009P-L , and Sawyer Hogg . But it is not , however , permitted on Elmer , which is where my basic behavioral grid was installed . Sorry . MAN gets up . GIRL Where are you going ? MAN I am going back . GIRL Take me with you . MAN It would make you , like us , sad . GIRL It would make me very happy . MAN Space in the vehicle is confined and not many . p. 16 GIRL I do n't mind . MAN I have to think on this . Pause . GIRL Well ? MAN I think you have become , like me , sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . I am a murderer . MAN ( Standing tall . ) Indeed . Further , you want to join the girl Huns , who are a great menace out there . You are your wicked sister . Your good sister is the one you have murdered . GIRL All I did was say " drop dead . " MAN In all religions of this world , to think a bad thought , or say a bad thing , is to make accomplishment a fact . Bad thought , bad mouth , bad act . Thing thought , thing said , thing done . As for instance : Bad ( happy ) thought , " drop dead , " good sister are killed , crash , thump , bounce , bounce , bounce , dead . What a happiness for you ! Pause.Religion makes you feel good feeling about the world . As though it were not truly there . GIRL Where ? MAN Here . GIRL What ? MAN The world . p. 17 GIRL Shit . I 'm fucked . MAN Step on neighbor 's face . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate it . What 's done is done . MAN Not necessarily . GIRL What 's that supposed to mean ? MAN You can undo certain events , as , for instance , happy murder of good sister . You can change good , happy events till they become sad , too . As on Elmer , or even more loathsome worlds of Gorgo , Yrsa . Thusnelda . Pause . MAN sits down.Like the lamentable bad sex of Elmer . GIRL All I want to do is get off this dump . MAN I can undo the murder , but it will make you sad . Pause . GIRL I do n't believe a word you 've said . You 're a fake . MAN I am a weird . After word comes weird . It is an old proverb . GIRL begins packing up the silver . GIRL You are one of them , a Fascist cur . I 'm getting out of here . I am going where no one 's ever been before . I am going where people do n't creep low all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out of this cheesy , rancid banana republic . The biggest banana , and the cheesiest , the lowest , the creepiest , the most conniving . The whole damn political climate makes me gag . And you 're a fake , a fucking bad joke . p. 18 MAN As you wish . Man snaps his fingers . As before , the SISTER enters @x Scene one . The same . SISTER Michelle , Michelle . This is madness . Pause.I have absolutely nothing to say to you , Michelle . Do you know how foolish you are , how retrograde ? Have you considered the sky , Michelle , all the pretty things that float and bob in the wind ? Have you considered nomenclature ? Have you thought of all the ages , heaped one upon the other like Ossa upon Pelion ? Have you considered the torturous ascent of the species , of mankind , through all the eons , from a one-celled bacterium , through all the viscous , sticky stages , through the finny and four-footed curtain raiser , amidst the Permian bogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cretaceous . She roars.Then wee , little , rat-faced humanoids stealing reptilian eggs , gleeful little entrepreneurs She nearly swoons.Surely you have not considered all this , Michelle . Therefore you are damned in the face of God , and thrown out of the family hearth , as though a leper , a pariah , yes , an outcast , one despised and hated , from whom no good is expected . Become a bag lady , Michelle . Become a street person and share your needles with the underclass , the wretched of the earth . Pause.Become one of those whose name is not spoken . Become one of those whose bones are crushed beneath the armored heel of divine virtue . Become an insect , or a horde of insects , as in your wild , obscene fantasy of being a girl Hun , with which you terrorized your Uncle Jack , now fresh in the grave , whose only wish on his deathbed was that you be restored to sanity . But no , no , you have become unclean , one of the enemies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you given thought to the Judeo-Christian tradition ? Weeps.You will creep low , Michelle , among the foul and slimy things that dwell in darkness . Your dreams will be fog and noxious gases from the unholy pismire of eternity . Divine wrath and retribution will haunt you , Michelle , and snap at your heels and harry you all your days till , exhausted and feeble , you roll into a cold , wet ditch and die . Screaming.All this , Michelle , all this p. 20 GIRL Drop dead , Jennifer . SISTER drops dead again . Pause.My God , I do n't believe it . I did it again . MAN Much as before , she is dead . You have killed her twice . GIRL I just ca n't stand Jennifer when she gets in a snit . MAN Now you are more happy than before . GIRL Did you do that ? It was you . It was your fault . You brought her back . MAN The surface of things are obscure . GIRL Give me a hand . MAN and GIRL haul the SISTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are four feet protruding.There . It 's done . MAN You did not believe I could undo the twisted skein of fate . GIRL I feel awful . All I wanted was to run away from home , and here I 've gone and murdered my sister , twice . MAN Many people would envy you . I am made happy watching your natural human excess . GIRL I feel rotten . Now I 'm really doomed . MAN Do not worry . All religion is , as you say , baloney. p. 21 GIRL How the hell do you know ? MAN I know . I know much . I am a weird . We know these things . All is hocus-pocus . The truth is inenerrable . Religion is baloney . GIRL What is " inenerrable " ? MAN It means " unable to be narrated . " Pause.The feet are intriguing as they stick out from the metal boxes . GIRL Now you 've got to take me with you . MAN You would have to comb your hair our way . You would have to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress our way . It would not suit you . It would make you sad . GIRL I feel a total repulsion for everything human . All I want is to get away . We 're all yahoos . MAN You have not convinced me by your reasoning . There is a virus of humanity that resonates amidst the jangle of your voicing . It is what I like . But perhaps I should stay here and become like one of you , a killer , a bigot , a secular humanist , or some combination of these , with my special powers I could become a member of the thought police , a TV evangelist even . GIRL You 're starting to talk like a Fascist again . MAN The universe is inherently Fascistic . Pause . p. 22 GIRL I do n't believe that . The universe is n't inherently anything . That is a cynical , reductive position . And one typical of a person unwilling to examine the political implications of his own discourse . Alas , you are all too human , and a reactionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Xuphus . MAN You would not be happy on Elmer . GIRL I doubt it , if everyone there thinks like you . MAN We do not " think . " We reflect light along various vectors of force . GIRL That 's a cop-out . I 'm getting out of here . You 're a fake . MAN snaps his fingers . SISTER enters once more.Oh , for Pete 's sake . You do n't mean we have to go through this again . SISTER Michelle , Michelle . I ca n't believe it . GIRL Make her go away , Xuphus. ** Make her go away or I 'll do it again . MAN A language virus has infected her . As a consequence we are no longer on the same modality . Sorry . SISTER ( Starts to overlap GIRL at ** . ) Michelle , I have absolutely nothing to say to you , you little pinko rat fart . You treacherous little whorelet ! How dare you try to escape ? America needs airheads like you , America needs cheese , America needs corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape you commit presence in the name of absence , you waffle , you devolve , you infect the gene pool with alien mumbo jumbo , you tarnish the national flatware , you appoint yourself an unindicted co-conspirator , you become a garbage truck chasing a Good Humor truck , ** you become the perfidious Chinese general Pang Chao , who chopped off the heads of the Hsiung-Nu , the first Huns , and that , Michelle , that ai n't beanbag ! Pause.What do you have to say for yourself ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . The earth , have you considered the shape and the weight of its elephantine folds , twisting and writhing beneath your wicked feet ? Have you paid the slightest attention to the doings of the damned who labor forever , without recompense , in the ovens of hell ? Have you considered the doings of the Devil , your consort , for I can see with my own eyes that this strange man you refuse to introduce , is the Adversary himself and no other  --  p. 23 MAN I am Xuthus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have sold your soul to him to pay off your vast gambling debts , and the cost of your recent abortion , and that through his agency you plan to enter law school , even though your GREs were truly mediocre . Yes , Michelle , and you sold your soul to him , that 's how you came to be nominated for homecoming queen , even when you professed to have no such interest in such things , when I would have died for the honor Pause . GIRL ( Starts to overlap SISTER at ** . ) Jennifer , you had better stop shouting at me because I am not your ordinary little sister , Jennifer , no I am more than you ever bargained for and if you think my patience is not limited then you are quite mistaken , Jennifer , a heavy price indeed so you 'd better watch out . I mean , like , CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE ? TO BE EATEN ALIVE BY FIERCE , WILD ANIMALS , YES , TO BE SEIZED AND HELD DOWN BY SHARP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE GROUND , FLAILING AND SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE , HELD IN THAT ANIMALISTIC GRASP , THEN CARRIED ON THE RUN , OVERLAND , THROUGH BUSHES , BRIARS , POISON IVY , DEEP INTO THE FOREST , WHERE THE LAIR OF THE CREATURE IS , THEN DROPPED DOWN , MAIMED AND BROKEN , BLEEDING AND SUFFERING FROM INDESCRIBABLE WOUNDS , HORROR , AND AGONY . THEN , PIECE BY PIECE , TO BE TORN APART , DISEMBOWELED , AND DEVOURED ON THE SPOT . WELL , THAT IS YOUR FATE IF YOU PERSIST , for I am of the Tribe of the Beast , of all the underclasses , of all the disinherited of the world , and I want nothing from you but to watch the look on your face when you come to realize that George Bush is the author , yes , the sole author of the Iran-contra mess , and that under the administration of his unmentionable predecessor all the many political denials of this contemptible banana republic reached critical mass , and we all , yes all , but you in particular , became political has-beens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relics of a great dream gone sour . JENNIFER , YOU 'VE LOST IT TOTALLY , AND YOU 'D BETTER SHUT UP . p. 24 SISTER ( Subdued ; starting to overlap GIRL at* . ) No , Michelle , I think you are a totally worthless person and that you will surely come to a bad end . And that 's that . I have no more to say . I 'm done . I have spoken . It is finished . I 'm going . The die is cast . Done . Nothing , Michelle , I have nothing to say . MAN Truly wonderful . GIRL Jennifer , you asked for it . And now you 're going to get it . Jennifer , * drop dead SISTER ( Overlapping GIRL at* . ) No , you drop dead , Michelle . The GIRL looks stunned , then drops dead . The MAN and the SISTER look at each other for a moment in silence , then drag the body and deposit it in yet another locker . There are six feet now in view . Pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we have defeated her . SISTER Fucking barbarian , she got just what she deserved . MAN The girl Huns may have more agents on this world , I fear . I hear their invisible ponies at night , pawing and whinnying in the distance , hidden . SISTER Well , this one is finished . p. 25 MAN It is good she was low on ammunition . We would be busy all night with your clones . SISTER You must prepare the ship , while I file a report . Our orders require we be airborne by three . Hop to it , Xuthus . Yes , Excellency . Pause . MAN But , is n't it right for us to take a little moment to savor our victory ? SISTER Yes , perhaps you 're right . She relaxes.This ridiculous Terran getup , these idiotic baggages . These frightful shoes . MAN I have champagne hidden in the woods out there . Would you like ? SISTER Why not ? It 's about the only thing on this hideous cheese bucket worth the effort . Bring on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Off . ) I have left it in a cool spot , beneath a cold stone in a burbling brook . Pause.Back on Elmer I will rest . SISTER I 'm up for a promotion . Then it 's off to the beaches of Valeska . Valeska 's one of the least expensive of the bright worlds . MAN ( Off . ) I have not heard of this Valeska . For my holiday I visit family on Hamburga , the dark side . It possesses an excellent system of underground grottoes , hot waters with health-making minerals . But then I am low-class , a mere weird . p. 26 SISTER The Huns have not ventured that far into the Trailing Trojans , I surmise . MAN ( Off . ) No , they regard it as low priority , owing to the clouds of soot . But we are used to soot . It is strange , I am having trouble locating this magnum of Dom Perignon . Perhaps over here SISTER I am weary of small worlds , Xuthus , so I shall move to Vesta once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hun . I 'm an ace . MAN ( Off . ) Lucky for you . He reenters.My name is still on the proscribed list , hence I am not permitted beyond the Tilting Line from Marlu to Winchester , nor beyond Jole , Brunsia , Manto , Monachia , Hippo , Geraldina , Alekto , Chaika , ITA , Skip , 1969 QP , Onnie , Bronslawa , Stroobontia , China , Seki , Harris , Amber , and Linda Susan . Nor am I ever invited to elegant parties . It is because my skin color is offensive to the High Lords of Vainu Bappu . If I was not made stupid by centuries of servility and were not a slave to my wicked cravings I would turn traitor and join the girl Huns against you . He goes out into the night again . SISTER Such thoughts are treasonous , Xuthus , watch what you say . p. 27 MAN ( Off . ) I am your trusted servant , madam , you would not betray me . Pause.Where did I put that bottle of champagne ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRL wakes up and wiggles out of the locker . She looks stunned but then recognizes her SISTER , both GIRL HUNS . They smile . SISTER Sometime you must tell me the whole chronicle of the madness of small worlds , Xuthus . MAN ( Off . ) The old stories are pointless , madam . All you needs to know is that the surface of things are obscure . Aha , I think I have rediscovered the champagne , it is closer to where I have buried the vehicle , amongst the prickle thorn and poison ivy . The SISTERS don their Hun hats , which were in the other suitcase . The other feet belong to more GIRL HUNS , who join their comrades . SISTER I would in particular like to hear the whole tale of the seven worlds . We hear a cork pop . MAN ( Off . ) Ah , that is a sad , sad tale . Even for the sad people of the Caldiera that story must not be told , ever . GIRL HUNS deploy with bows and arrows . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your lips . MAN enters , dressed as a waiter , with champagne and glasses . MAN Whoops . SISTER Yes , Xuthus . We are taking your spacecraft . MAN You think you have fooled me , but you have not fooled me . You may have defeated me , but you have not fooled me . I have seen this approaching all along , all the way from Agnes to Jubilatrix , all the way from Jubilatrix to Ara , all the way from Ara to Frostia , all the way from Frostia to Pittsburghia , all the way from Pittsburghia to Sara , all the way from Sara to Stereoskopia , and all the way from Stereoskopia to Dudu . It was clear to me , even then , even on Dudu , that I would encounter you , then , at the appropriate time , you Points to the GIRL.her sister in crime would appear , and then together , you would betray me and then destroy me Pause.but not yet , please , as I am getting around to my point , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expatiation , not to mention a certain mood of serenity in the teller , not to mention a certain intellectual curiosity on the part of the hearer , you two , girl Huns , unused to a learned discourse on the higher subjects , by one such as me , a weird . For I may be a mere weird , but we weirds have our sense of honor , and this honor forbids much . Pause . They point at him.God curse those who do what is forbidden . And chief among the things which are forbidden are the combing of hair not our way , the eating of food not to our taste , the enactment of dramatic scenes not to our liking , and the rubbing out of our very being , when we have merely been engaged in the working out of our destiny , as described in the Big Book of Tlooth , who you may not reckon as amounting to a pot of piss compared with your god Tengri , but I assure you it is not so , because Tlooth was before Tengri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learned how to swagger so He demonstrates.not by mimicking the wild creatures of the steppes , the wildernesses , and the Outer Dark , bears and tigers and rhinodraconopeds even , but by imitating our god Tlooth , who is called Tlooth for good reason . For Tlooth is truth made manifest and angelic and eternal . And the truth is eternal , that is why it is called the truth . Truth , Tlooth , the same . The curse of Tlooth is to be feared because Tlooth sees far and possesses a big stick . Think of it before you crush me under your heel like an insect Pause . They point at him.Think of the big stick of Tlooth , and how it will fall upon you like fate , for he will avenge me . Pause.For even if he will not avenge me , it is in questionable taste to abuse one of us , the weirding ones , because we injure no one and are meek , and we possess beautiful shoes , and hurt no one except when we give in to our wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but if the truth be told , as Tlooth would have it , they are also wonderful , and if we have on occasion given in to them , you surely did not complain , never on Mildred , Tea , not on Yangel , Shimazu , Oongaq , 1951 RJ , Bonsdorffia , Shane , or Shaposhnikov . Nor on the wastes of Gondola . Nor among the painted screens of Fulvia , where golden hummingbirds witnessed all we did , wicked as it was . Wicked as it was , you never said no , though you despised me for it , and refused to discuss it because you were above such things , or so you said , when you were sated and had had your fill . And when we tried it your way it was not so good , because it was far better our way , because we are not so proud as you , and not so stuck-up and bent on conquest for its own sake , and as for your wicked sister with the greenish hair , all I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her physical aspect is almost sufficient to cause me to make an unpleasant remark . Nor did you fool me for a moment neither . p. 29 GIRL HUNS ( A choral curse . ) DROP DEAD ! MAN drops dead .
