Yet when Young Sek Yuk , a Chinese immigrant , commutes from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn to her job in mid-Manhattan , she reports to a sewing table , as generations of workers have done before her. // A floor above her , Giovanni Gismundi , an immigrant from Bari , Italy , who now lives in Corona , Queens , cuts skirt patterns . And Carlos Figueroa of Woodside , Queens , picks off racks the skirts that Mrs. Young and Mr. Gismundi have worked on and packs them off to such customers as J. C. Penney and Bamberger ' s. // Despite decades of industry decline , severe job losses and unrelenting pressure from imports , these employees of Lloyd Sportswear Inc. on West 35th Street , as well as 40 , 000 other manufacturing workers , still earn livings in the 32 square blocks of the garment center that make up one of the city ' s most fabled , insular and obstinately idiosyncratic sections. // // Encouraging High-Rise Development // // Garment manufacturing has been a traditional steppingstone for millions of immigrants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The future of the garment center has been continually , and often emotionally , debated throughout the nearly 40 years in which employment in garment manufacturing in the city has fallen from 360 , 000 jobs to somewhere around 150 , 000. // That debate now has woven itself into the arguments over the $1. 6 billion plan proposed by the city and the State Urban Development Corporation to transform the garment center ' s northern neighbor , Times Square . The plan calls for building a hub of four enormous office buildings , nine rehabilitated legitimate theaters and a huge wholesale merchandise mart that might include 500 , 000 or more square feet of garment showrooms. // A key aim of the plan is to encourage in the relatively untouched western midtown area the sort of high-rise development that has already transformed the East Side . The city is supporting the plan with what may amount to well over $350 million in tax abatements over 15 years. // The project , according to its 880-page draft environmental impact statement , will bolster garment wholesale operations , which employ 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under in creasing pressure from modern regional merchandise marts in such other cities as Dallas , Atlanta , Chicago and Los Angeles. // Although it concedes that increased pressure on rents and showroom activity in the proposed mart may result in a drop in manufacturing in the garment center , the statement asserts that the effects on blue-collar work are likely to be minimal. // Over five years it projects a possible loss because of the merchandise mart of at most 36 to 47 manufacturing concerns , or 1. 2 percent of those in Manhattan , with between 400 to 540 jobs . But it said the garment center could be either helped or hurt by fluctuations in the midtown real-estate market. // However , many proponents of the plan , as well as industry leaders who are concerned and sometimes fatalistic about it , believe the effects will be much greater . They fear it will effect not only the city ' s largest manufacturing business , the hub of the nation ' s apparel business , but the quirky life style that provides much of its underpinning - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an often desperate scrambling take precedence over the cool market research and corporate planning of Manhattan ' s white-collar office towers. // " I see the elephants dancing among the chickens , " Jay Mazur , the general secretary-treasurer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , said gloomily during an interview . He called the impact statement " shoddy and incomplete. " // " I see here the possibility , if not the beginning , of economic gentrification , " he said . " There ' s a momentum in this city for gentrification under the name of improving the city , and we have to ask at what price . Here , it threatens the jobs of the city ' s own third world - its mostly minority , working-class community . " <> <> Fears of Real-Estate Pressures // // City officials attribute much of the concern to a basic fear of change and believe that in the end the garment district , if anything , will be bolstered by the Times Square plan . Industry leaders are wary , however , that the project will strengthen real-estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what small manufacturers can afford. // According to a recent survey by the New York Interface Development Project , a nonprofit research group , base rents for garment-center manufacturers average a relatively modest $5. 68 a square foot - a third to a sixth the rents for nearby office space. // Dr. George Sternlieb - director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University and a former coat , suit , fur and raincoat buyer for Bloomingdale ' s - sees the new pressures in a different way than many in the garment center. // " What you ' re dealing with in the garment district is not modern-daycapitalism , " he said . " It ' s folk capitalism - these are my folks and I know them very well . They ' ve been raised in the shelter of those old loft buildings . They understand those buildings . It ' s home . Suddenly , youre going to drag them into the light of day. // " It ' s good for them , " Dr. Sternlieb said . " It ' s necessary . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <> <> Offices vs . Manufacturing // // Behind these reflections are the contrary paths of Manhattan ' s flourishing office economy and its traditional , and mostly ailing , manufacturing industries , which have lost more than half the million jobs they boasted in 1950. // Manhattan ' s office growth is marked by top-level and creative jobs being clustered in the borough ' s high-rent districts , while production work takes place in cheaper quarters anywhere in the world . But garment concerns still strive for " integrated production , " in which , as much as possible , everybody from delivery people to designers works under one roof. // The advantages to this , many manufacturers say , are life-sustaining . Because most of the concerns are small , with perhaps 15 or 25 employees , manufacturers can easily keep rein on their entire operation . And because they are near suppliers and competitors , they are constantly able to monitor the rapidly changing fashion market. // It is a pattern that Roger Waldinger , an assistant professor of sociology at City College who has studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This has allowed some sections of the industry , such as production of women ' s outerwear , to stabilize in New York after years of decline . <> <> Some Work Subcontracted // // While sewing work these days is often shipped to contractors in Chinatown or other boroughs and many showrooms have relocated from factories to buildings on Broadway and Seventh Avenue , other patterns have remained rigid. // The most exclusive coat and dressmakers - such as Ralph Lauren , Bill Blass and Abe Schrader - occupy the district ' s venerable blue-chip addresses , 530 and 550 Seventh Avenue , on the western corner of 39th Street . Slightly-less-expensive coat makers can be found at 512 Seventh Avenue . Sportswear and bathing-suit concerns are centered at 1407 and 1411 Broadway and , as many a newlywed knows , 1385 Broadway is given over to bridal wear. // On the side streets , 37th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues is the coat-manufacturing center , 39th is the center of expensive dress manufacturing and 35th is the center for moderate-price dress production. // Even dining is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 38th Street ; salesmen and buyers , the Big Apple Coffee Shop on Seventh Avenue near 38th Street ; manufacturers go to Radishes , Lou G. Siegal ' s and Morgen ' s Restaurants and the private clubs atop 500 Seventh Avenue and 1407 Broadway , and Italian sample makers and pattern makers eat at Paolo ' s on 38th Street off Seventh . In Dubrow ' s , the last of the great garment-center cafeterias , according to an ancient pattern sewing-machine operators gravitate toward the main floor off Seventh Avenue while cutters frequent an upper part near the 38th Street exit . <> <> Market Research on the Street // // Despite staggered lunch hours and a 30 percent drop in the number of workers since the mid-60 ' s , midday can still be hectic . When navigated by a veteran , like Max Drier , whose Career Originals makes coats that he describes as " the Rolls-Royce of fake furs , " the center ' s streets can be more informative than a market-research team. // Mr. Drier no sooner reached the lobby of his building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago than he spotted Barry Shapiro , one of the owners of the Diane Button Company , at 225 West 37th Street , which manufactures buttons for many cloakmakers. // " Hey , Barry , " he called . " How ' s business ? " // Mr. Shapiro , a younger , informally dressed man , smiled , then waved his hand in comme ci , comme , ca fashion. // After they talked , Mr. Drier headed to a listening post on the curb outside his building to gather more scuttlebutt . " If people were active , he ' d be the first one to know , " he said of Mr. Shapiro. // In an atmosphere as insular as Seventh Avenue ' s , the going wage for a sewing-machine operator in Sri Lanka - 12 cents an hour compared with about $6 an hour in New York - can be better known than plans for 42d Street . <> <> Business Limits at 41st Street // As he sipped a morning coffee with two other " outside men " in Dubrow ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expressed the universal despair about imports . But he said he did not know much about plans for Times Square . " We don ' t have much business past 40th Street , " he said . " Maybe 41st Street. " // Many industry leaders , however , like Eli Elias , the head of the 116- member New York Skirt and Sportswear Manufacturers Association , see the pressure on rents and the advent of the merchandise mart as eating away at the structure that people like Mr. Gluck and Mr. Drier thrive in. // Despite projected rent of $40 a square foot , the mart , they fear , will lure importers and major tenants from many key garment-center showroom buildings . This , according to Mr. Elias , will leave smaller tenants , who are unable to afford the mart rents , high and dry in buildings no longer visited by out-of-town buyers and will force other marginal companies to pay two rents - one for a factory and the other for a showroom. // In an oft-repeated phrase , Mr. Elias argues , " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to production to sales - " and turn it into a mart " - which would be nothing more than a front office and sales center . <> <> Views of Apparel Wholesaling // // This assessment is disputed by many , including city officials and those who are planning the mart . They emphasize that the amount of space reserved for selling apparel has already been drastically reduced in the mart and that apparel wholesaling is an important and growing industry that spins off money off from out-of-town buyers into hotels , restaurants and theaters. // " A human organism tends to reject a foreign body - it ' s almost the natural order of things , " said Herbert J. Sturz , chairman of the City Planning Commission , and the main city official shepherding development of the Times Square plan . " This is something that by the end could be a good thing for the industry. " // However , some supporters of the plan see it as helping to accomplish exactly what garment-center officials are most concerned about - the breakup of their special community. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I certainly think the garment center is typical of that , " said Larry Silverstein , chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York . " Manufacturers want single- story buildings today . They don ' t want material movement into heavily traveled streets . They no longer can afford to utilize facilities that are inefficient . I would think it ' s an anachronism. " // Showrooms and offices will stay in midtown , he said , but manufacturing will find its way to the South Bronx or other boroughs . <> <> Planning for Any Transition // // Should such a transition take place , it must be planned for carefully , according to such observers as Dr. Waldinger and researchers from the Interface Project . There are some garment functions that must remain in Manhattan to be successful , they say , and others that probably do not. // They have called for such assistance as tighter restrictions on the conversion of manufacturing space to offices , and greater assistance in helping manufacturers buy or co-op their buildings or relocate to other boroughs. // Mr. Sturz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manhattan was important , said the city was considering several initiatives along these lines. // For people like Young Sek Yuk and her fellow employees at Lloyd Sportswear , the garment center is important in a way that is traditional in New York - as a ladder for upward mobility . Mrs. Young ' s son graduated from New York University this spring. // Mr. Gismundi , the pattern maker , who is 30 years old , has gradually been handed more and more responsibility at the company . And Mr. Figueroa , who works in the shipping department , has a son who is a captain in the Army and a daughter who is a teacher. // The garment center , for all its woes , works for Max Drier , too. // Last week , it was not the Times Square plan that consumed his interest , but an internal memo from a large department-store chain . Three of his fake-fur coats were sold in just seven days this month at a store in Chino , Calif. , the memo reported. // Much of Manhattan may be moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go a long way to convince Mr. Drier that the beat was off in the garment center. // While his coats were selling , after all , the temperature in Chino , Calif. , reached 110 degrees. //
