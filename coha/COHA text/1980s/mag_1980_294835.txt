JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN by Henrik Ibsen <P> This play may carry a jinx . Each the infrequent attempts to stage it in the U.S. in the past quarter-century has proved monumentally inert , and the present production at Broadway 's Circle in the Square is no exception . Borkman is a wintry drama , a sort of autopsy blanched ruined lives . <P> The hero , played by E.G. Marshall , was once the head of a great bank . He embezzled funds in a desperate move to protect his depositors , was caught out and spent five years in prison . For the past eight years he has paced an upper room in his bleak house , unspoken to by his wife Gunhild ( Rosemary Murphy ) as he broods over past wounds and dreams an illusory comeback . <P> The bank is not all that John Gabriel has destroyed . He jilted the only woman he loved , Gunhild 's twin sister Ella Rentheim ( Irene Worth ) in order to climb the ladder of success . Dying of an unnamed malady , Ella returns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she had reared during Borkman 's disgrace . Gunhild wants him to redress the family honor . In a bitter confrontation scene , the two sisters drink from the cup oof the past as if it were vitriol on ice . <P> Erhart has a more intoxicating idea , like eloping with a pert divorcee ( Patricia Cray Lloyd ) . The desolate John Gabriel wanders out into the snow to die , and the sisters clasp hands of reconciliation over his body . Marshall , Murphy and Worth do the best that able professionals can with their roles but this production rarely gives them much scope . <P> <P> - - T.E.K.
