The leader of the Coalition for Better Television is an unprepossessing man . Slight and balding , the Rev. Donald Wildmon , 43 , was born in Dumas , Miss. , was ordained a Methodist minister and for 20 years preached to congregations in his home state . Wildmon has been a doer all along : he is the author of inspirational tracts ( Treasured Thoughts , Graduation Gold , and 15 other books ) . He and his wife run a side business : leading tourist junkets to the Holy Land . <P> Nearly five years ago , Wildmon experienced a prime-time epiphany : one viewing night he could find nothing but sexual innuendo , profanity and violence on television . He was shocked into starting the National Federation for Decency , which in February became a member organization of the Coalition for Better Television . In 1977 he gave up his ministry in a suburban Memphis congregation to work full time for untainted television . He operates out of a dog eared three-room office in an unprosperous quarter of midtown Tupelo , Miss. , assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV set , with a video tape recorder attached . <P> Despite his hardball attitude toward sponsors of offensive TV shows , Wildmon coats his censoriousness in down-home congeniality . " People say I do n't like sex , " Wildmon joshed to TIME Correspondent Robert Wurmstedt last week . " But look , I got four kids . You do n't get four kids by picking blackberries . " Wildmon was less amiable when asked whether he was simply a puppet of the Moral Majority . " I 'm not a member of Moral Majority , " he insisted . " I 'm not going to get into personalities or politics . All I 'm talking about is television . " <P> " I believe certain things would be best for society , " Wildmon says of his social evangelism . " Television should be morereflective of real life . The values you see on TV are Hollywood values . That does not represent the values of middle America . " <P> Wildmon , a fan of the old Columbo show , asserts that he is tolerant of a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I agree to leaving some of it on . Some of it is real life and has been on since the 1960s . I 'm not saying other values should not exist or that I want to try to beat them to death with a club . Life is never going to be cleansed . " <P> Wildmon says he would welcome strange bedfellows . " If the A.C.L.U. wanted to cooperate with us in this television area , " he says , " I 'd be tickled to death . " His rationale for the sponsor boycott is simple : " The clearest expression of the First Amendment is the right of a person to spend his money where he so desires . The networks can show what they want . Sponsors can sponsor what they want . It 's the marketplace taking care of itself . "
