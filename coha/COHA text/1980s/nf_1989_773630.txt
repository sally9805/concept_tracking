txt // they are recognized , thus losing their chance to participate in the contest . Absentee bidding is a service provided by all auction houses and galleries , though usually not rural auctions where speed and closure within the day are desirable . Bidding by the absentee method means that anyone interested in one or several lots , but not in sitting through the sale of the 650 miscellaneous items which may compose a single auction , can leave a written bid which will be executed by the house against others on the floor . Usually this service is free , as are telephone bids , though sometimes there is a nominal charge of a dollar or two . If a potential buyer wants an Art Nouveau porcelain vase and is willing to pay $250 for it , a written bid is left for that amount . If , during the actual sale , bidding on the floor goes no higher than $180 , then the absentee bidder wins the lot for the next higher increment , or $190 ( if $10 raises are being used ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest bid to be received is the winner . Absentee bids are used for several purposes . Both dealers and collectors who wish to keep the knowledge of their successful bids private will use this system . In some cases , the successful bidder , appearing uninterested , may actually be in the room during the sale but , wishing to remain anonymous , has the house do the bidding . Others use the absentee method as a way of guarding themselves against the entrapment of passionate overbidding , which may occur in any auction . Many absentee bids are left by people too busy or too impatient to sit through hundreds of uninteresting lots for the chance to bid on the one they want . To prevent overbidding , it is well for the collector to take a lesson from the dealers who buy at auction . Knowing almost precisely what they will be able to get for the item in their shop , they set for themselves a very firm price beyond which they will not bid . Collectors need to set their own limits before a sale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting which looks like it might be a Hudson River School piece is on the block , it is easy enough to set a limit for oneself of $650 , given the oil 's condition and the uncertainty of its authorship . But as the bidding goes to $750 , it is equally simple to suddenly reassess the value of the picture ( which , after all , you were clever enough to recognize the quality of in the first place ) because of the surprising interest it is generating on the floor . With incremental rises of $50 , it does n't take long for a picture first thought to be firmly worth $650 to magically increase a hundred or two in the mind of the bidder embroiled in the process as the competition gets stiffer . A typical general-line auction house will very simply catalog the lots with no lengthy descriptions .

Occasionally in an auction , a lot consisting of several or many related items is sold at the bid times the number of articles in the lot . This is clearly stated in the catalog as ( x 2 ) or ( x 12 ) . A set of 60 pieces of sterling flatware in the Grand Baroque pattern , for example , might be sold for $15 to $20 apiece x 60 . When pairs of items are sold ? vases , tables , candlesticks ? they are also offered at the bidding price times two . Even if announced by the auctioneer , bidders are sometimes unaware of this arrangement , and they may be surprised that they have just paid double for what they thought was the price of both .

Keeping the customers interested , giving them variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting a bargain are all effective measures to insure their attention . The intensity of pace and the direct participation of the audience are both important factors in making this marketing scheme work . Equally important is the sequence with which merchandise is offered . The auctioneer , or cataloguer of the lots , must be skilled at creating a pace for the sale by the sequencing of lots for maximum effect . The first dozen or so warm-up lots will usually be lesser items . As the auction proceeds , lots will be arranged to create strong interest , action , and high prices intermittently throughout the sale . If a large collection of mantle clocks , music boxes , or Christmas plates are being sold , for example , they are best spread out in groups of four or five over several hours , thereby forcing those interested only in those specialties to stay for the entire auction . Encouraging steady attendance throughout a sale allows more potential bidders ; there is little more disappointing to an auctioneer or to a consignor than a nearly empty house created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the // good lots have been sold . For a collector or dealer , the tail end of a sale with few competitors left in the audience may be just the opportunity to make profitable purchases . In the selling of the greatest objects of art and decorative arts , and the disposal of renowned estates ? house and land included ? the auction is chosen as the preferred method of sale . The reasons are several . The relative speed with which such a transaction can be accomplished makes it a natural choice . More important , public auction is generally considered to be the fairest method for realizing the true market value of any property . If one assumes the auction floor is populated with knowledgeable and interested customers , this concept holds true . At auction , however , like any other place where antiques are sold , a single object has no single price . Its value is dependent on its audience and , in an auction , upon who is present , interested , and doing the bidding . Auctioneers know only too well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an identical piece , sold at the same auction house several weeks later , might bring only $300 . It is equally disturbing that in the same auction where a dealer or collector may be both buying and selling , the prices others are paying seem so small , whereas the ones they have to pay appear inflated . If anyone in the antique business has an objective and realistic perception of the market value of antiques , it is the auctioneer or the regular auction goer who , week after week , year after year , sees prices hammered down to the person willing to pay the most for them .

Self-conscious early Americans were consumed with a desire to be up to date with European fashion and were frustrated by the dearth of fine domestic goods available to them . Before the Revolution , and certainly afterward , many of the finest furnishings in American homes came from European and other sources . Bolts of silk and cotton yardage for draperies and upholstery , fancy glass and mirrors , and thousands of crates of Chinese porcelain came by shipload to the new nation . Ordered sight unseen by mail , the arrival of new shipments was always the cause of much interest and celebration . By the late eighteenth century , Westerners were having an influence on what the Chinese actually produced .

Americans were also sending drawn or engraved coats of arms to Chinese potters who obligingly copied them onto the glazed porcelain which they ordered . The expansion of the population and the westward growth of American cities prompted a great dependence on ordering by mail . By the mid-nineteenth century , every manner of goods were available in quantity in the east . Sears and Roebuck 's mail-order business , whose first catalog of 200 pages was issued in 1893 and advertised products of every sort to the hinterlands , became an American institution . By 1908 their catalog contained 1,184 pages of fabulous products and was a veritable " wish book " for city and country dwellers alike . Each new issue was a delight , and each old copy went " out back " to fulfill an even more necessary function . Today , ordering anything by mail is big business , and ordering antiques in this way is a flourishing trade . Every antique periodical and trade journal contains advertisements which encourage mail ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Antique Trader , Collector 's News , and Antiques and Collecting Hobbies are specifically for the purpose of putting collectors or dealers in touch with other dealers who have what they want . At least theoretically , running an antique business by mail is the best of all worlds . It can be done from one 's home with minimum overhead , and most of one 's capital can be spent on developing an attractive inventory and on advertising . Following the ads of mail-order dealers for more than a year or two , however , will alert the collector to the fact that many , even most , who enter the business will fall by the wayside within a year . Antique collectors are well advised to peruse the periodicals in which antiques are advertised , to see which dealers are constant participants , and even if they have no intention of buying by mail , it is a good // way to keep up with collecting and price trends which may not be the same as the more familiar local ones .

Because of the modest profits realized by such goods , quantities of general-line antiques priced under $25 are not likely to be found by collectors through the mail . Ordinary household collectibles are better ( and more cheaply ) bought closer to home . The merchandise which mail-order dealers stock is perhaps most similar to what might be found in specialty antique shops . They will handle better-quality porcelain , glass , and silver , as well as items which are familiar to buyers , such as advertising art or pattern glass . For instance , many highly successful flatware- and china-matching services operate exclusively by mail . Most mail-order dealers will handle only things that are in good condition , and will also offer a ten-day return policy if merchandise does not meet a buyer 's expectations .

For those collectors looking for items to fill in a specialized collection , mail order might well provide an avenue of success . Estate Sales A living man who suddenly parts with his collection is inevitably under suspicion ; are the things fakes ? Or is he perhaps just speculating ? With a dead man 's goods , no such question arises ; they smell right . They are the portion of the quarry which is thrown to the hounds at the end of the hunt .

For it is here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a family 's // life . In a properly conducted estate sale , the contents of the home are presented without substantial editing , and without the intercession of a dealer 's taste or preselection . The term " estate sale " is applied quite broadly in contemporary usage , broadly enough , in fact , that many customers are disappointed when entering such a sale to discover that it does not meet their expectations of what they believe a true estate sale to be . Webster 's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary defines " estate " as " ... the degree , quality , nature and extent of one 's interest in land or other property , " and in further definition as " ... the assets and liabilities left by a person at death ! " Thus an estate is quite simply all the property of an individual whether that person is living or dead . Interestingly , in Denmark , the word used for " estate " is dodsbo , which literally means " house of the dead . " In this country , the popular usage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sale because it has a mystery and romance connected with it which makes the event more marketable than another name . Usually " estate sale " implies that the house will contain the entirety of someone 's possessions whether that person is dead or has been moved to a nursing home . The term " moving sale , " on the other hand , more generally implies that the contents are fewer , and are principally those less desirable items that a family has found not good enough , too inconvenient , or too costly to move to their new home . In a typical moving sale one would expect to find bulky items such as upholstered furniture , excess bedroom sets , yard equipment , tools , sporting goods , and other items discarded for a simpler living style or a change of family status .

How Estate Sales Are Conducted When a family or a legal agent such as an attorney or banker wishes to have an estate sale conducted it is usually for the purpose of disposing of the entire personal property of its former owner with neatness and dispatch . While the preliminary negotiations and set-up time may entail some weeks or even months , the event itself is usually over in a couple of days . The relative speed of this procedure is of considerable benefit to the efficient settling of the terms of a trust or will , or in generating financial liquidity for a family needing cash for hospitalization or nursing home care , for example . Estate sales are generally conducted in one of two ways . Either they are accomplished by the family of the owner of the goods , or by a professional in the business who is called in to manage the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country and they are virtually unknown in Europe , where estates are almostly always settled through the auctioning of goods . With some exceptions , they tend to be most prevalent in larger metropolitan areas . In the several largest American cities , as in most of western Europe , entire estates are most often liquidated at auction . In these instances , the auctioneer will move the goods to his showrooms and sell it on the block . These sales , interestingly , are still referred to as " estate sales " by the auction house . Who Does Them Families who attempt to run an estate sale themselves are often surprised by the amount of both physical and mental labor which such an enterprise entails . Because they are relatives , they frequently lack the objectivity which is required in the successful marketing of used goods . On the one hand , sentiment toward a favorite object may cause them to set an unrealistically high price . Ignorance of true market value , on the other hand , may let a treasure slip by for a pittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family-run sales both frustrating and rewarding . Often families involved in such an enterprise are encouraged by someone among their ranks to " save money " by hiring not a professional but someone who may have a passing familiarity with the process of garage and house sales . The buyer lookWhere // ing for paper goods , advertising brochures , postcards , or old magazines may easily walk away with an armful of bargains priced by a relative who has viewed them as trash . Many hardened estate sale goers begin their search of the estate by looking behind the garage where the " unsaleable " trash , discarded before the sale , is waiting for the garbage collector . A less lucky buyer may be overwhelmed by the exaggerated evaluation of an item which the family knew was an antique , such as a brass bed , oriental rug , or mantle clock on which they expected to make a killing .

Nearly all professionals will have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages loyal customers to return to buy and recruits new estate sales as well . Professionally conducted estate sales are run either by people whose sole business is the management of such affairs , or by antique dealers who are otherwise proprietors of shops and have house sales as a supplement to their store-front enterprises . For the latter , it is an effective way to generate considerable cash flow in their bank accounts , keeping their own bankers mindful of their business health and " traffic " potential . Occasionally professional appraisers who are not antique dealers will accept a sale . For the exclusive estate sale conductor , the dealer who does it part time , or the appraiser , the process of finding , organizing , and doing sales is essentially the same . Choosing the right person to conduct an estate sale is a very serious business . It must be based entirely on a mutual trust for both their expertise and their honesty . They will have keys to the house and access to everything in it . A client must know that their integrity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit pocket or a forgotten diamond in a dresser drawer , it will be recognized and dealt with responsibly . Ignorance on the part of a conductor can be as devastating to a client as dishonesty . A string of genuine pearls incorrectly identified and sold as costume jewelry steals from the trusting client as surely as if it had been a cash robbery . The buyer at an estate sale , however , only lives in the hope of this actually happening . At this stage of the enterprise , no one worries about honesty . Dealers with shops are in a natural position to hear about potential estate business . Drop-in traffic will often lead to a sale , word-ofmouth commentary in neighborhoods where they have conducted other sales to more . Families who see their advertisement in the Yellow Pages or in the local paper will call them for assistance .

Ultimately the best guarantee for further business is the reputation the conductor has earned by setting up consistently clean , attractive , well-priced , and interesting sales . Loyal followers attend all these sales because they can depend on a certain level of quality goods and fair pricing . Reviewing the Goods In a typical scenario , the estate sale professional will be called in to take a look at the contents of a house . At this time the conditions and terms of the sale are established by mutual agreement of both parties . If relatives are allowed to go through and pick favorite objects , that is determined in advance . This can often be the critical stage in which the dealer will decide whether or not to take the sale . If the contents of the home are too few or undistinguished , it may not be worth the time . If so-called " leader " items of antiques and other desirables are skimmed off first by family , the same conclusion may be reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and merchandise waiting to be sold ) may contract to do a smaller sale with the agreement that his or her own shop merchandise might be added in to the estate to round out missing furnishings . This is called planting or seeding a sale , and is frowned on by customers and the purists in the business who will neither add nor subtract from the original contents of the household . Within minutes of viewing the interior , an experienced estate sale specialist can determine the gross amount which the contents of the home are likely to bring . This is accomplished by quickly adding up low estimates of significant items in the house . The sale price of major furniture , newer major appliances , good rugs , pictures , important collectibles , and antiquities will be totalled . The sophisticated conductor will display a low-key interest in whatever the house holds . Many an amateur , in showing wild enthusiasm for a Tiffany lamp or eighteenthcentury highboy has inadvertently given an appraisal to a greedy relative while carelessly mentioning what price they might bring in the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes the attic are seldom considered in this rough total . This working sum , once established , is generally not shared with the seller of the goods . On the basis of this estimate and by judging the time the sale will take to set up , a simple contract will be signed which sets the terms and date of the sale and the percentage of dealer 's profit , and allows for a separate billing for the cost of advertising in local papers which is borne by the owner of the goods . The conductor will guarantee a empty house , // swept clean , at the end of the sale period . The services of managing an estate sale by a professional generally cost the owners of the goods or their agents between 25% and 35% of the total amount taken in from the sale . Occasionally where extensive handling of the merchandise by staff is significant or much preparatory cleaning of the premises is required , a higher percentage may be quoted , even as much as 50% in homes where people have lived like swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller percentage than 25% , unless the merchandise is of such quality or reputation that a smaller cut of a much larger gross would provide a satisfactory profit for the conductor . Few dealers want to run a sale with low-end merchandise and even fewer relish the idea of spending a week cleaning out debris and washing every piece of glassware and every toaster before it can be respectably offered for sale . Dealers make their profit from a sale in one of two ways : either because the merchandise is good , expensive , and desirable , in which case the percentage of their take is based on a higher gross amount ; or given a small sale with useful though less spectacular merchandise , the contents of the house are clean and organized and require relatively little multiple handling on the part of the set-up staff . Estates which contain hundreds or even thousands of small items , each of which needs separate pricing , cost the dealer considerable hourly wages paid to the crew doing the work . It takes far less time , for example , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will bring a fine profit to the dealer and the owner , than to price a bedroom full of miscellaneous linens , shoe stretchers , and bundles of coat hangers , which will bring relatively little . In this business time is definitely money . Setting Up a Sale Setting up an estate sale is a labor-intensive task , an effort which to many observers of the finished product is all but invisible . The average two- or three-bedroom bungalow typically generating $4,000 to $5,000 in gross sales will usually take two or three people the better part of a work week to set up . If the dealer receives $1,000 to $1,250 for doing the work , the staff must obviously be paid a minimum wage . Setting up , nevertheless , involves the work of a knowledgeable if underpaid staff , each member of which is able to contribute some specialty . They review the goods and organize them in a manner which brings the greatest clarity to the buyer , and shows the merchandise in the most flattering setting . All saleable items are removed from inaccessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers , and other storage areas ; the contents of all furniture are emptied . Unless there is enough potentially profitable merchandise in the garage to warrant paying a salesperson two days ' wages to watch the stuff during the public sale , these items are frequently condensed into the basement goods . In good weather bulky items such as yard equipment , hammocks , tents , and lawn furniture are displayed outside . Inside , tables are set up everywhere to display glassware , china , and collectibles . Linens are placed on beds , better quilts and tablecloths are shown on coat hangers . Similar and related goods are grouped together for ease of viewing . Any customer having attended more than a handful of sales will know that he or she can always expect to find the most important things in the living and dining room , tools and garden equipment in the basement . A good estate sale conductor will also clean up debris , hide anything that is not for sale , and not offer to the public any personal items which might compromise the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands that virtually no time is spent arranging merchandise that will bring no profit but nevertheless must be sold . Washing perfect sets of cut glass goblets is a reasonable investment of labor , whereas sorting National Geographics by date is not , since , except in rare instances , their only real value is to the junk man who is paid to haul them away for pulp . Odd glassware , electrical parts , paperback books , and rusty screwdrivers are usually grouped together unpriced , and offered as " Your Choice , 25 cents . " Pricing the contents of the estate is traditionally done the last day of the set-up , when order has been accomplished and the family has vacated the premises . Pricing done too early attracts the attention of owners still scurrying about anxious to know what their family 's possessions are worth . Should this happen , they are invariably amazed at how high the prices are , or equally shocked by how little some things bring . Keeping owners and other interested outsiders away from the property during the organization of the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herculean task which requires the persistence of a used-car salesman and the tact of a funeral director . The pricing found in an estate sale is generally less than that found in an antique shop and frequently low enough that antique dealers performing a 100% markup can still find stock for their business . The fairest pricing is achieved when two pricers work together acting as a check against one another . Experienced pricers know precisely what the market will bear for most ordinary household goods . Used food mixers , snow shovels , Ping-Pong tables , canning kettles , portable closets , and wheelchairs all have fairly standard values in an // estate sale , considerably below new market prices . For good antiques , however , prices may vary with the condition and rarity of the artifact and the quality of the sale in general . A good address in a stylish neighborhood , with many antiques , will produce higher asking prices than similar merchandise in a lesser sale in a bad part of town because it will bring a more knowledgeable crowd . Since no pricer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise of an outside appraiser who may come in to evaluate just the oriental rugs , the paintings , or the silver . Estates which contain such specialized items as the tools of a watch repairer or ham radio operator also require knowledgeable advisors in these areas . Most estate sale professionals have a list of experts they can regularly call upon for such services . These specialists , who usually charge a flat fee , will make calls to their own regular customers and inform them of the availability of these items in the sale ; occasionally they may also get a finder 's fee if their customer is successful in buying the item at the time of the sale . Some outside pricers will deliberately give low evaluations to items they are interested in , and will have a stooge waiting first in line the day of the sale to snatch them up cheaply . Estate sale conductors know and trust their outside appraisers . Once priced , the costs of items in an estate sale are firm until new rules are made , generally the second ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is always problematic to leave any items unpriced . Even if done inadvertently , these overlooked items are invariably the ones picked up by the first customers in the door . Establishing a price at the cashier 's , once the item has been identified by the customer who thinks a bargain is in hand , is a process which the buyer will always view with a certain degree of suspicion . It is particularly important that the cashier be someone who knows the merchandise and its prices well . The switching of price tags by would-be customers is not unknown in estate sales , where the heat of battle distracts the frenzied staff , and the preoccupation of other customers with their own hunting acts as no defense from competing shoppers who may be dishonest . Most estate sales run two days , often Saturday and Sunday , and occasionally Friday ; this ensures the largest audience as collectors have the most free time . The public is informed through ads listed under " estate sales ; ' " house sales ; ' or " household goods " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer a three- or four-line ad simply stating when and where the sale is to be held , most conductors prefer a fairly lengthy ad describing the important pieces and categories of goods offered to the public . After listing furniture , rugs , major collectibles , large appliances , and other big-ticket items , the ad will frequently // conclude with " many more items too numerous to mention . " This inspires and assures the scrounger that items not listed can be found in quantity , and probably just the ones they are looking for . The Public Sale A considerable amount of adrenaline is generated by the hours of anxiety just prior to the sale , on the part of the buyers waiting with boxes in hand to gather up bargains , or by the professional staff wondering if everything is priced and if those prices are correct . The antici- // pation of archaeologists Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon could hardly have been more acute as they waited for the first view of King Tutankhamen 's tomb than that of estate sale regulars who view each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excavation of buried treasure . As a crowd-control measure , most conductors of estate sales will limit the number of persons in the house at any one time . This contributes to the security and safety of their client 's property as well as providing good visibility of the merchandise and a relatively comfortable setting for the buyer . A certain amount of crowding is generally considered desirable and is thought to enhance sales as the frenzy of competition ( similar to that in an auction ) leads collectors to make hasty decisions . Some dealers , hours before the sale , will pass out numbers to those waiting in line . This means that some customers may show up for // a 10:00 sale at 7:00 , pick up a number as they would at a bakery , and be assured of their early place at the door when the sale opens . Meanwhile they can go for breakfast or sit in their warm car . Small camping vehicles , sleeping bags , lawn chairs , and thermoses of coffee are not unknown props for the competitive buyer anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that envied position in the first wave that enters the house . The dispensing of numbers at the door of an estate sale is not without its occasional problems which vex all participants . Like ticket scalpers at a Rose Bowl game , some entrepreneurs will arrive at 5:00 a.m. , get number one , and then sell it to the latecomer who does n't mind a $20 price tag for not standing in line . Antique dealers who regularly buy at estate sales often hire someone to do this in advance . Counterfeit numbers are also produced occasionally and the hapless sale conductor is called in to be the referee . In the mythology of antique collecting , it is often believed that the first body of customers who enter the estate sale will get the best buys . This is true certainly for those items which are fairly priced and are desirable . It is also true for grand and rare antiques whose prices , while as high as those expected in a shop , are so desirable to specialized collectors that they are anxious to have them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers , number one and number two at the door , might enter the sale abreast and simultaneously say to a sales person , " I 'll take this , " seemingly without inspecting it or even checking the price tag . On the other hand , later entrants into the house , particularly those who come at the end of the first day of the sale , might have the best opportunity to strike a bargain with the sale conductor . By the end of the first day of a two-day estate sale , the conductor has usually sold what will generate far better than 50% of the expected gross . But it is not always the best merchandise ? or even the bulk of it ? which has sold . In fact , the first customers to the cash register may well be carrying nothing more spectacular than a lawn mower , a stack of paperbacks , or a bottle of fabric softener . Antique dealers and others who run estate sales are anxious to get top dollar for their client ( and consequently for themselves ) for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put a good price on the best merchandise . Sometimes these prices scare off early bargain hunters and remain unsold at the end of the day . Minutes before closing on the first day is the earliest appropriate time to strike a bargain with the conductor , whose prices until then are firm . Since prices on the second day are generally reduced , this lastminute negotiation on the first day is advantageous to the buyers who may not find the desired item there if they wait to return the next day . The conductor will want as much merchandise gone from the house as possible to give a successful look to the sale when it opens the second // day ; thus bargaining at this point should be welcomed . Since the first strong interest expressed for an item may also be the last , it is well for the seller to consider a reasonable offer at this stage of the sale should the opportunity present itself . Whether buying old or new merchandise , no customer wants to make purchases in a setting which looks picked over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condensing the merchandise throughout the sale , and as major items are sold , rooms are cleared out and closed off .

The only setting which discourages business faster than a sparsely arranged house is one too populated with underworked clerks hanging about the house like vultures with their sales books , desperately waiting for customers . On the second day of the sale , prices are usually reduced to increase the chances of cleaning out the household . While the percentage of reduction may vary from one sale to another , it will often be something like 50% off on items under $25 , and 25% off on items over that amount . Obviously , as the sale progresses to its conclusion , these percentages are more likely to become negotiable , sometimes quite dramatically .

Leaving Bids Most estate sales provide the opportunity for the customer to leave a written bid for merchandise which they wish to purchase at a reduced price . The bid slips can be completed at any time during the sale . Second-day bids , however , are best offered verbally to a sales person who is in a position to give an immediate answer . At the end of the first sale day , the conductor reviews bid slips on unsold merchandise and calls the interested parties who have left the highest bids . These bids may be only 60% of the original asking price , but nevertheless acceptable to the seller . Since hundreds of customers have already seen the item in question , including antique dealers , second-hand dealers , and junkers , and no one has been willing to pay the tag price , it probably indicates to any but the most stubborn of sellers that the tendered offer is indeed the fair market value of the item . In the case of tie bids , the earliest bid , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The Cleanup There are few estate sales in which the entire contents of the household are completely sold out , down to the last boxes of canning jars , rusty-spring daybeds , and even a few collectibles . Since the conductor of the sale has contracted to leave a clean house for the client , and two days of selling have not found a buyer for every item , even at reduced price , there is still a need to get rid of the residue . This is accomplished in one of several ways . The conductor who is also the owner of an antique shop may skim off any decent remaining merchandise at a substantially reduced cost and let it sit in the shop until it sells . If higher-priced items remain unsold , that same dealer may take them on consignment , again waiting for a customer willing to pay a good price for it . In this case the owner also waits for money due , and may not be interested in a delay in settling the estate . Some professional conductors without shops will retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is never a wise procedure , unless the material is of the kind likely to be found in almost any household . Very individual items and those identified with an earlier sale are easily spotted by regular estate-sale goers , who have memories like steel traps and are generally perturbed by antics which create stale sales of leftover household goods which they have seen before . Most professionals faced with the task of cleaning out a house will call in a " clean-up man " who will take the good with the bad and give the conductor a set price for the remains . Clean-up people are at the lowest level of the evolutionary scale of the bizarre cast of characters selling antiques and used merchandise . They are those hapless souls who , like gleaners in the field , by virtue of their position , are forced to be content with the chaff , the leftovers which constitute the worst merchandise in the trade . They typically come into a picked-over sale , cast a disgruntled eye , complain that there is nothing of consequence left , complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred or two for everything . Just as often they may offer nothing and generously agree to take away the residue without charge . The experienced conductor knows that , in order to encourage the cleaners to take on the assignment and get anything in return , a few items of some quality must be left to sweeten the bait ? a wicker chair , a cute telephone stand , or a few pieces of not-so-chipped cut glass . A good cleanup man , or even a willing one , is worth knowing . Settling the Accounts When the sale is over and the house is empty , the conductor settles the accounts . The staff members are then paid , often in cash , // though sometimes in remaining merchandise . For bookkeeping simplicity , these staff members are considered " independent agents , " responsible for their own Social Security and tax records . Sales receipts , written out for each item , are totalled to determine the gross intake . The sales slips may or may not be given to the client along with their check representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The disadvantage of having the client informed of the sum of each sale means that there is room for argument and complaint if they are disappointed in what their things brought . The estate sale client is most happy for a fat check with only a vague notion of what everything brought . Rarely will estate sale conductors do a complete inventory of all objects in the house and give it to the client with the actual prices at which those items were sold . Neither the contents of the average house sale nor the inefficiency of this method would justify this as a regular practice . Garage Sales , Yard Sales , Tag Sales It was the day of her yard sale and everything she did not care to keep was being carried into the yard . . . . An assortment of dinette tables and chairs were scattered all over the front lawn . There were boxes and boxes of fruit jars , flashlights and radios that did not work , dozens of mixing bowls in all colors , cups and saucers from Oatmeal boxes , casserole dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union accompanied by ashtrays from their capital cities . There were nine plastic wastepaper baskets , one with an oil painting of flamingos . . . and twelve T.V. trays with foldup legs that would surely be purchased the first thing ... . Edward Swift Splendora The most familiar and numerous of the transient sales , run by amateurs , are known in various parts of the country as garage , yard , or tag sales . In the last decade , the family-run sale of household miscellany has increased to startling proportions . It is not unusual for local newspaper ads to feature through the better part of the year several pages listing such sales , by neighborhood , throughout the city . In some municipalities , it has become such big business that its operation is regulated by laws which require the purchase of a temporary license to do business , // and limits are placed on the number of sales per year which any individual may hold . The increased sensitivity of nearly everyone in recent years to the cash value of their unwanted goods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected the flow of better merchandise into the charity agencies who run second-hand shops nationwide . Charity shops these days are filled almost entirely with used clothing and pots and pans , books , and broken household electrics . In the 1950s and ' 60s such retail establishments still showed good furniture of the Victorian and golden-oak periods . One would be lucky these days to find a high-style chrome dinette set . // A successful family-run sale is accomplished with the same kind , though not the same degree , of planning and organization which a larger estate sale requires . In order to be worth doing at all , the items included for sale must be worth buying . If a family is ridding itself of a burned-out toaster or a broken stereo , it is unlikely that any other family will want it either . Buyers at garage sales , regardless of how poor they may be , nevertheless want things which are clean , complete , and working . Normal wear and tear is expected , but one ski pole , a cut-glass sugar bowl with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress is of little value to anyone . In recent years the multi-family sale has become popular . Sometimes these are called block sales and the entire neighborhood participates , each neighbor being responsible for marking and selling his or her own property . The advantage to this system is that there is much more merchandise , and of greater variety , to attract customers . The costs and labor of promotion in local papers and neighborhood signage ( if it is permitted by local ordinance ) may be equitably shared . There are essentially three rules for running a garage , yard , or tag sale : ( 1 ) everything for sale should be useful to someone and should be clean , ( 2 ) everything should be priced , and ( 3 ) the price should be negotiable . Fair prices at these sales should start at 1/3 to 1/2 of what was originally paid for it . For the serious collector of antiques , family-run sales are probably not worth the time they take to survey . Driving from one end of town to the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , plus the cost of the gas and patience to do it , may be more investment than all but the most eager salers will want to make . Collectibles enthusiasts , however , will probably spend the majority of their time at such sales as well as at flea markets rather than in established shops . Families having children leaving home , who go into retirement , or do their spring cleaning are likely to bring baseball cards , old comics , used sports equipment , old tools , wedding gifts , and home furnishings from the ' 50s into the open . The growing interest in ephemera ? relatively recent cultural material not classifiable as antique ? as well as in the " fabulous ' 40s and ' 50s " has given the garage sale , yard sale , or tag sale an enthusiastic new clientele . // BUSINESS Dealing with Dealers We dealers are pretty slick . Some are all right , but some are not . We 're good and bad , mixed . There are grafters , crooks , conners , lifters , zangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of bloke on the make . . . . Cleverer than any artists , better than any actor . wit , nerve , and cunning does not mean that it is without its rules . Nor does it mean that neither morality nor etiquette is connected with its practices . Those who are most familiar with the broader antique market realize that it is nevertheless a small world filled with people who gossip and who know each other and each other 's inventories . It is only prudent , then , for a collector to participate as little as possible in loose talk , and , in general , to respect the people with whom one is dealing . In a big department store , clerks may not care at all about what customers say regarding the merchandise , since the former have no personal stake in its quality , price , or selection ; they may , in fact , sympathize with the customer who finds that nothing fits , everything is too expensive , and things are made poorly . The average antique dealers , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own them . Additionally , they have a very personal interest in what the customer thinks and says about their merchandise , since the assembled goods represent a combination of their taste , intelligence , and choice . The very act of walking into an antique shop means that the customer has entered the private space of the vendor , and should act as thoughtfully as if in someone 's home . A simple , friendly " Hello " to the dealer should be enough to start out on the right foot . Customers perceived by the dealer to be thoughtless are not likely to be given the time of day let alone any deferential Just because the buying of antiques is highly competitive and requires 90 // treatment when it comes time for price negotiations or any other special acts of assistance . Thus , the customer does well to remember some general rules of etiquette . Many antique shops are small and most are crowded with breakables of all sorts , so it is to everyone 's advantage to protect the goods from damage . Bulky coats , dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise with the exception of small children and large dogs . Dealers will be happy to hold customers ' packages behind the counter or store their wraps while they shop in comfort . An enthusiastic overreaching for a pretty vase on a high shelf , or for a fragile figurine across a deep counter , is commonly done in the heat of the hunt for antiques , and can easily lead to disaster . The ubiquitous " You Break It , You Bought It " signs in antique shops should be ample reminders of the embarrassment caused to both parties when accidents do occur . Having to pay for something which one has just damaged or destroyed , and probably did n't want at all , is very painful indeed . On the unhappy chance that a customer does inadvertently cause damage , it is not uncommon that the dealer will be gracious enough to reduce the tag price on the broken item and ask for compensation only to cover the cost of investment . No one in this situation , however , ought to expect such an act of mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Sensible dealers , of course , do not display negative and threatening signs about breakage , but rather prevent accidents by anticipating them , making certain that especially breakable items are put in appropriate cases and inventory is displayed in such a way that it can not be kicked , bumped , or tripped over . Neither smoking nor eating by customers in antique shops is appropriate even if the dealer is so engaged . If dealers damage their own merchandise by the carelessness associated with these acts , it is far better than the customer doing so . Antique dealers who are sensitive to their customers are aware that pleasant conversation often increases buyer interest , frequently followed by a purchase . Productive dialogue with dealers can provide the interested customer with considerable information about antiques , and the best dealers are eager to tell what they know to customers who show enthusiasm for learning . Dealers are aware that uninformed and ignorant people are not likely to buy anything , and that the customers who spend the most on antiques are the ones who know the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of the vendor to provide opportunities for this kind of informal instruction so likely to take place between seller and buyer ; it is simply good business . Serious collectors never go in groups when they are looking for antiques . The rush into a shop of four or five friends , killing a few hours // by bumming for collectibles , is not likely to engender much sympathy from dealers who must act as host or hostess to such cattle . These are often the same people who would happily pay $5 or $10 to see merchandise at an overpriced antique show , but come to a shop and see similar goods for free , complain about the prices , and expect the same degree of entertainment . Dealers realize that most visitors are " just looking , " but customers who ask specifically for certain items which the dealer might be helpful in locating for them are likely to be regarded more seriously when they appear to be knowledgeable about some area of collecting . Conversation between dealers and customers , unless they know each other very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to antiques . Even within this arena , there are discussions best left unsaid . Talking about other dealers and what they have is of little interest , and possibly a source of irritation , to dealers trying to sell their own wares . No dealer is interested in what some prospective customer just bought in the shop next door , or in all the fabulous things they have at home that they bought for next to nothing . Neither are dealers interested in what anyone 's grandmother had or in conversation which includes descriptions of their own family heirlooms such as , " We had one just like this , except ours was better " or , " We threw ours out years ago ; never thought it was worth this much : ' There are plenty of antique collectors who think it is fair game to walk into a shop and proceed to downgrade the premises , the merchandise , the prices , the dirt , the smell , or the disarray . Yielding to this temptation is best done privately and away from the shop , other customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shop , and even their prices , is a perfectly appropriate thing to do . Seeing remarkable , interesting , and even familiar antiques quite naturally generates comment among customers and with the dealer . However , a certain discretion should be exercised in guiding the conversation . For example , visitors to antique shops should never seem shocked by prices . If they express their horror at high price tags , they are conveying the message to the vendor that they are unsophisticated , unappreciative , or just plain cheap . If a customer says , " I just saw one identical to this in a shop last week , and it was only half this price , it might just be that the dealer bought it from that shop last week , thinking a profit could be made from it in his own establishment . Prices of antiques , in any case , are based upon what the dealer paid for them , and two identical items for which differing amounts were paid may rightly bear different price tags . Without thinking how their query sounds , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get this ? " upon finding a remarkable item in his or her shop . Despite the innocence of the question , and // the fact that the customer is probably only making an observation on the rarity of the object , it sounds to the dealer either like an accusation that the item was gotten illegally , or that they are being asked to reveal their source of inventory . Customers whose curiosity is so keen might better phrase the question in some less accusatory manner : " I 'm surprised you can even find such a wonderful item ; did you get it locally ? " Unlike ordinary retail stores where prices are fixed by unseen management , the prices found in antique stores are determined by the buyer who is also the seller . Because of the direct contact between the customer and the dealer , antique buyers regularly assume that prices are negotiable , and most dealers expect that they will be asked for discounts . A seasoned shopper eventually knows which shops and which dealers have firm prices from which they will not waver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found it , hauled it , cleaned it , repaired it , researched it , priced it , paid the rent , insurance and advertising , and YOU want me to take LESS for it ? Shops like this , fortunately , are in the minority , and most dealers are not offended by being asked about price . Regularly dealers give discounts of 10% or more to other dealers as a professional courtesy , and usually they will give as much to any other interested buyer , particularly on days when the rent is due . How dealers are asked makes a big difference in the way they respond to questions about pricing . A customer should never offer a dealer a price such as , " I 'll give you $85 for it . " Rather , it is the prerogative of the dealer to set the price , which is then agreed to or not by the customer . There are perfectly acceptable ways to ask that a lower price be considered . The flaws in merchandise or their high prices should be of absolutely no concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece . Pointing out every chip , crack , or missing part is not the way to make a dealer lower a price . If a piece is flawed enough to warrant a lower price , no respectable collector should want it anyway . The least offensive ways of asking for a price reduction include such phrases as , " Are your prices firm ? " " Can you do better on this ? " or " Is this your lowest price ? " Almost always a dealer will make some concession to the customer , enough , at least , to compensate for the sales tax . If not , the dealer may even explain that he or she can not lower the price , since " That 's almost what I have in it . " Occasionally , and sometimes frequently , customers know more than dealers about the goods they are selling . No matter how helpful it // may seem at the time , it is unwise to let them know that their prices are foolishly low or high , or that their attributions of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these complaints are specifically related to items being purchased , they are of no concern to the customer . In any event , most dealers are not likely to thank a customer for pointing out flaws in their merchandise or errors in their judgment . Leaving an antique store , like entering one , is an appropriate time for some pleasant remark . Even if the customer has made a purchase , though especially if not , the proprietor should be thanked for time and attention taken . A positive remark or two about the shop is always appreciated , even if it can be nothing more flattering than praising the ample parking . Pickers , Runners , and Divvies Scouts ? We call them barkers , in the trade . An antique dealer has scouts , people who will pass information his way . Tinker Dill was one of mine . I have three of four , depending on how rich I 'm feeling at the time , paid on commission . Jonathan Gash The Judas Pair A picker is a dealer in antiques who acts as an independent buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of whom are other dealers . Since they seldom deal directly with the public , pickers are largely invisible to most collectors . A picker does not have a shop , and usually has no inventory other than what he or she has found in the last few days . It is the picker 's self-appointed job to know what every dealer has and wants , to be everywhere at once , and make the transactions quickly to the profit of all parties . The work which pickers perform can best be described as the wholesaling of antiques . In England , those who do the job of picking are appropriately referred to as runners and divvies . Runners also act independently by running artifacts from one dealer to another with a relatively small markup in the bargain . Divvies ( from the word " divine ; " meaning to discover intuitively ) work on commission or by-the-job payment and are often attached to one or several dealers specifically seeking out requested items or even just information about the location of desired antiquities . Like antique dealers , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplement to a primary income . Since their enterprise has no // permanent location ( other than that indicated by their home phone number ) , no easily identifiable business expenses or provable profits ( their transactions are often in cash ) , many pickers operate just outside the parameters of legitimate business and not infrequently avoid the constraints of licenses , sales , and income tax . Antique dealers who regularly bear considerable overhead , and who take their business and civic responsibilities seriously , often have a natural antipathy for pickers who appear , in many ways , to have the best of both worlds ; they have a high-activity level of trading , and no burdens of rent , insurance , and regular hours . But like the birds who live on the backs of hippopotami eating pesky insects , the relationship of dealer and picker is a symbiotic one . The average picker , if there is such a person , is an " action junkie " whose need for constant antique dealing probably exceeds that of the most avid private collectors . Pickers are intimately familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity . They also know what kind of merchandise any given proprietor prefers to deal in and what they are willing to pay for it . While they will occasionally have specific orders to find particular antiques for dealers , most pickers buy what they can cheaply , and then seek the right customers for them . Watching a picker in action is like seeing a rat in a maze . They nervously nose about in likely and unlikely places ? auctions , flea markets , garage and estate sales ? as well as buying directly from private owners . Sometimes they are the foot-in-the-door characters who prowl ordinary neighborhoods to knock on doors and ask the inhabitants if they have any antiques , giving the trusting owners pennies on the dollar of their actual worth . They live , talk , and dream antiques , and their favorite topic of conversation seldom drifts even to the weather . Since pickers are wholesalers , they must buy at a below wholesale cost , especially if they are selling to dealers who , in turn , must also make a profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the area of antiquing that allows for the least margin of error , and the keenest sense for the realistic assessment of market prices . Pickers look for sleepers , for merchandise of quality which is underpriced in shops or elsewhere . Their profit markup may vary with each transaction , but it is often below the usual 100% expected by the shop dealers . The skill of being a picker requires a talent for the rapid turnover of merchandise , very often the same day it is purchased . For this reason , the picker who has just bought a silver service , oriental rug , or a notable painting may be willing to immediately sell to a dealer at a quick 25% commission . Naturally the picker will try to extract as much as possible , but is always guided by the knowledge that those to whom he // sells must also profit from its resale . The private world of trading inhabited by the picker is based on an eye for quality and the previously unnoticed , upon volume dealing , and upon holding no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts ? The phrase " consult an expert " leads nowhere . Where is the expert ? If he is a dealer , he is selling his own goods . If he is not a dealer the question is embarrassing , because , unless he takes time to make certain regarding the antiquity of the piece , he is likely to be running into serious trouble for the future . There is no professional appraiser of antique furniture , though some persons act in that capacity on occasion . Wallace Nutting Furniture Treasury Many amateurs , and some even more experienced in antique collecting , hold the notion that somewhere there are people who are the final authorities on antiques ; they are the ones who know everything ; they are the leading authorities ; they are the experts . One needs to understand relatively little about science , law , or the military to realize that so-called experts in those fields are challenged daily regarding their relative knowledge of their respective disciplines . Even more so in the areas of art and antiques , where criteria of quality and authenticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially difficult to assign the title of expert . The question of who then are the experts is one which is open to considerable discussion . Wallace Nutting , while himself considered by many to be the most authoritative figure in the field of early American furniture , even decades after his death , held a very definite opinion on the subject and strongly denied that such a thing as an expert actually existed . The expert is often the person who happens to be correct at the time asked for an opinion . An expert might be the representative for an auction house whose estimates are realized at sale , or the New York City antique dealer who senses that a highboy is fake , or the museum curator who buys an important Etruscan bronze with someone else 's money , or the art historian with a Ph.D . who " discovers " an artist , then makes him famous . When the sale price at auction more than doubles its estimate , however , when the dealer ignores intuition and buys a dud , // when new scholarship casts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian pans a recent monograph , then the " experts " responsible for decisions which initially made them glow with brilliance are no longer authorities in the minds of the public . Experts , it is probably safe to say , are those who appear to be correct in their judgments much more frequently than they are wrong . The field of antiques is , in one sense , no different than that of law or religion . Any established standards or rules ( of which there are many ) are open to interpretation , and any agreement by two experts in the value of a single antique is what makes prices soar at auction , an inflation which halts only when one opinion deems the price too high . No matter how knowledgeable , no one is always correct in judgment , nor do similarly qualified experts necessarily always agree . A case in point is the Rembrandt Commission , established in 1969 to celebrate the tricentenary of the painter 's death . Its purpose was to examine and review all known paintings of Rembrandt and compile a report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which establishing authenticity of the pictures was a primary goal , consisted of the most distinguished scholars in the field of seventeenth-century Netherlandish art . For many pictures , after personal examination of the art , there was general consensus that they were genuine ; on others there was considerable disagreement . For one picture , Man with the Golden Helmet , the treasured and much publicized masterpiece of the State Museum in East Berlin , there was general agreement by the experts who concluded that it was genuine . Years later , in 1984 , the same picture came under considerable scrutiny , and was declared by a new generation of authorities not to be by Rembrandt at all . Who is actually correct on this matter still remains to be seen . Experts in the field of antique collecting , whatever qualifications such a title might entail , are generally called upon for two different , though related , kinds of advice . Either they are expected to authenticate an antique by commenting on its age , authorship , and condition , or they are asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks may be done by a single person , sometimes not . Authenticators tend to be those experts outside the fields of buying and selling , who may not even quote dollar evaluations in their work . Naturally , objective individuals , who have no personal stake in the antique being judged , are the least likely to be suspect when they give their opinion regarding its quality . Evaluators are , essentially , appraisers , and are more thoroughly discussed later in the following section . Museum personnel , because of their training and daily familiarity with objects of quality , are frequently asked to be authenticators when there are questions about items of major consequence . Museum per98 ANTIQUE COLLECTING sonnel , and curators in particular , have earned an unfortunate reputation in the past for their aloofness and their general inaccessibility to the public . In the last few years , fortunately , this has begun to change as museums , fighting for survival in a world of few arts dollars , are willing to do almost anything to make themselves relevant to segments of the population less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly hold expertise clinics in which anyone off the street with a curious object can use the knowledge assembled there and ascertain the identity of his or her objects . Museums , by virtue of their responsibility as educational institutions , and because of established policy , are disallowed from quoting monetary evaluations when examining items brought in by the public . Scholars , usually art historians or archaeologists connected with universities , and who publish in areas such as classical sculpture , romanesque bronzes , mannerist painting , or WPA murals , for example , are another likely source for the expertise required to authenticate such material objects that might be in question . Like curators , scholars study museum collections as well as private collections , and have field experience of considerable depth . Scholars are also familiar with related literature and archival sources and tend to know their own areas with an intimacy which often borders on monomania . They are often flattered when contacted about their specialty , and predictably generate useful responses to intelligent inquiries . The act of becoming an expert has traditionally been accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are considered antique experts outside museums and colleges have learned their craft through the school of hard knocks and daily practice rather than by formal training specifically intended to educate practitioners in the antique field . There are , in fact , relatively few places nationally which teach the kinds of subjects that would educate one toward becoming an antique expert per se . The distinguished course of study at Winterthur , Delaware , is a major exception . In conjunction with the University of Delaware art history and American studies programs , it is one of the few which exclusively deals with decorative arts and the material culture in its relationship to history . This graduate curriculum leads to a master 's degree , and produces highly trained candidates for museum and historical-society work . Most other museology programs throughout the United States concentrate on museum management and practice , rather than on expertise and connoisseurship of objects as stressed in the Winterthur program . The older and larger historical installations regularly host workshops and seminars on antiquities . The New York Historical Association // in Cooperstown offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum in February ; and Greenfield Village in Detroit and Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts hold regular antique forums available to anyone who pays the tuition . Academics , however , are more likely to avail themselves of such enlightenment than are antique dealers and appraisers who might well need such information in their businesses . Other specialists , frequently self-styled and self-taught , are those who write books and articles about collecting , many of which are superb , others not . The best of these writers assimilate enormous amounts of information on a particular subject such as collecting old photographs , Hull Pottery , Gaudy Welsh , antique doorknobs , Susie Cooper pottery , transportation postcards , railroad memorabilia , and other areas of focus . The best of these sources gives an account of the history of the production of such items and sets the specialty within the context of its time . It may outline the business aspects of the company that made the objects , naming owners , designers , artists , promoters , and dates whenever appropriate . Pattern names and dates , original costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all topics of interest to collectors , which are often included in such texts . Usually books of this sort are heavily illustrated with examples which may be very useful for collectors attempting to identify their own particular pieces . Occasionally these books consist largely of examples from the personal collection of the writer who may or may not have any substantive reason for its writing aside from showing off his or her own accumulation . Many collectors , unfortunately , are primarily concerned with what their own things are worth , and the inclusion of price lists ( which are soon out of date ) is often what sells the book . Real experts on various antique subjects can also certainly be found among those regularly encountered in the buying and selling of antiques . These are the dealers , auctioneers , pickers , and other collectors who , by virtue of their handling quantities of antiques , are bound to know a great deal about a number of subject areas . Their knowledge is often not consistently even in all areas , nor very orderly in its application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who inhabit the world of antiques ; they have learned from the experience of both failure and success and their counsel is usually worth heeding . Particularly on an informal basis , the clever listener can gain volumes of information and collecting tips from these people who generally love talking about what they know best . Gaining from the experience of others is the least painful kind of learning in a field where one 's own mistakes may cost dearly . // Appraisers He stared at the jeweled egg resting in the palm of his hand . After a moment he looked at Duffy , then back at the egg . Ben 's calculations collided with one another as he tried converting Miss Natalie 's estate into something of value , jewels into dollars , history into net worth . Nan and Ivan Lyons Sold ! Appraisers are yet another kind of expert within the antique trade . It is the job of the appraiser to evaluate in actual dollars and cents the value of objects of art and antiques . For good reason , appraisers may be some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation of goods requires not only a familiarity with current pricing , but they must simultaneously be able to assess the inherent worth of objects by judging their authenticity , condition , and age . Those who appraise for insurance , inheritance , or tax purposes are also bound by law to provide upon request documentation for the evaluations which they have made . Appraisers are likely to come out of a background of antique selling . Some have discovered that good money can be made just from what they know as much as from what they might sell from a shop . The best of these make their living exclusively by evaluating antiques , others do it on a part-time basis as a regular part of their shop business or in conducting estate sales . Many fewer of them have taken workshops and participated in studies programs given throughout the country . Certificate programs on appraising are offered , for example , at such places as Yeshiva University in New York , which enable appraisers to take short sessions in such subjects as appraising art and decorative arts ; identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry , American , English and Continental furniture , collectibles , and Americana . These courses are intensive and are taught by those in the appraisal and allied fields . They are truly workshops , focusing on specifics , and are not lengthy , extensive courses with the kind of historical or analytical approach to material culture which baccalaureate or graduate degree programs in universities provide . The 6,000-member American Society of Appraisers does sponsor a degree program in Valuation Sciences offered at several colleges throughout the country . Appraisers are obliged to keep abreast of current trends and evaluations in the antique market . In part , this is accomplished by subscribThe // ing to innumerable periodicals , including collecting magazines , price guides , trade journals , and auction catalogs . Memberships in such groups as The American Society of Appraisers , or in the smaller Appraisers Association of America , may provide the members with newsletters , trade journals , bulletins , and continuing education opportunities . The mere fact that dealers or appraisers are members of any such organization does not necessarily mean that they are experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accurate or honest appraisal than anyone else similarly familiar with the business . Ironically , a full membership in the ASA requires two years of fulltime experience in appraisals ( presumably while not yet qualified as a professional ) , and the passing of a written examination , as well as an interview with the examiners . It may also require sponsorship of the candidate by an already established appraisal practitioner . Membership qualifications in the AAA , according to their own application form , are somewhat looser and are " . . . open to all qualified individuals in the antique , art and collectible field for at least three years , on approval of the Board of Directors ! ' These and other dealers ' associations usually espouse a code of ethics which involves the maintenance of high standards and professional behavior . Those appraisers who join such groups do it primarily for the benefit of increased public trust ; the public expects professionals to belong to professional organizations . The field of appraising , however , can not be rightly considered a profession in the way medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it does not enforce standardized educational procedures and qualifications . The actual licensing of appraisers has not yet become a reality , but it is reasonable to assume that as greater responsibility falls upon its practitioners , there is the likelihood of its becoming regulated by this method . As with the practice of many other arts ( rather than sciences ) , skilled appraising depends heavily upon experience . Like dealers , appraisers typically have seen , handled , and analyzed thousands upon thousands of antiques . They generally have minds which are encyclopedic in this area , and can remember an object , a price , or an entire collection with the greatest precision and detail . Their memory for visual images and prices of related objects in the market gives them the basis for comparison of the antiquities which they are called upon to appraise . Some appraisers specialize and become well known in a particular area such as silver , costumes and textiles , jewelry and watches , fine art , or period furniture . In the evaluation of a large estate , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise , may he called upon to give their opinions regarding the stamp collection , the Oceanic sculpture , the religious vestments , or the Piranesi folios . // The accurate value of an antique is usually needed for one of several reasons ; it is used for insurance , tax , or resale purposes . Since the evaluation figure quoted by the appraiser in each of these cases might be different for the same object , collectors who need appraisals should make it clear from the beginning as to the purpose of the evaluation they seek . Usually the professional appraiser will ask ( or already knows ) what the intended purpose of the appraisal is , and will act accordingly . Appraisers who are evaluating a single piece or an entire collection for insurance purposes are likely to choose a high figure which reasonably reflects actual replacement cost in the current ( and appreciating ) market . Highest appraisals , at demonstrated market values , are also given to property of potential donors , which is being given to public institutions for the tax advantages . In both instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appraisal . Low market evaluations tend to be made on property which is part of an estate . Subsequent inheritors of the property from the estate desire appraisals as low as is reasonable to minimize their own tax responsibilities . Appraising , unfortunately , is not limited exclusively to those who do it as a full-time job . Almost everyone at every level of the antique trade , at some time or another , gives appraisals . The free informal verbal appraisals given by these people are best used as general guidelines by the recipients and are , for all intents and purposes , as worthy as their cost . One seeking an appraisal should be reminded that vendors of antiques , while often knowledgeable about their subject , are not the most objective source for advice . For example , if a choice antique , such as a ruby , pressed-glass kerosene lamp in the Lincoln Drape pattern , is brought to a vendor for evaluation , it is unlikely that that dealer , anxious to have such a plum in stock , would give it a fair price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , might sell it directly to the dealer . In the business of appraisals , there is , apparently , no one system whereby fees are charged for the services . While some appraisers will charge a percentage of the value of the property for their fees , ( somewhere around 5% ) , such persons are usually to be avoided for the obvious reason that they may tend to over-evaluate the objects in order to increase their own salary . More frequently , appraisers will charge a flat rate for single items , and will determine their charges for a number of items , or a whole house full , by an hourly fee . Time and knowledge are what an appraiser is selling , and travel and research time are considerable in larger jobs . It is not unusual for appraisers to charge between $50 and $100 per hour or more for their advice . Few reliable appraisers will give an immediate on-the-spot evaluThe // ation , but will do their homework before assigning a dollar figure to the client 's property . Finding comparable items in auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each appraised item is listed separately , described in enough detail to be accurate and useful for the insurance company , bank , or Internal Revenue Service using the information . In the listing , style , age , material , maker , condition , size , and color are usually described , along with an assigned dollar amount included for each item . // It is strange to think that this precious British Guiana one-cent magenta once belonged to me . Sixty-one years ago I unearthed it and sold it for six shillings , Now it is shown in a glass case all by itself when on exhibition , with a bodyguard of detectives to look after it . L. Vernon Vaughan , in a letter to the London Daily Mail , 1934 Assessing the value of an antique and pricing it appropriately is probably the most mysterious aspect of the entire business to both vendor and buyer . In one sense , antiques are no different than any other goods which are sold ; they are worth whatever anyone is willing to pay for them . Like new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their cost , and like things which are new , they can be bought wholesale or retail , or at any of the stages in between . Antiques may be purchased from those desperate for cash , from those indifferent to a sale , or even from people reluctant to part with their property . Sellers of antiques may be completely ignorant of their value , or may be extremely knowledgeable as to their intrinsic or monetary worth ; all these factors have a direct bearing on what they will charge for them . No antique has an absolute right price . Even the authors of the numerous useful price guides which fill the market are the first to admit that the prices which they quote in their books are meant to be a general guide to dealers so they will not " give anything away " and to collectors so they will not " get stung " on overpriced merchandise . The price of an antique and its value are really two different , though related , topics for the knowledgeable buyer to consider . Value in an antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in its history . These may be a combination of any of the following factors : rarity , condition , beauty , historical importance , or even who owned it . Value , which is a much more elusive quality , is determined by the overall integrity of the object in relationship to its environment . The price of an antique , of course , is also based upon all those factors 104 // which affect its value , but also equally upon the external conditions of its sale such as time , place , and economy . The same Tiffany lamp , for instance , sold new in 1902 might have cost the buyer $250 , whereas in 1940 when it was hopelessly out of fashion it might have brought $50 , and in 1960 the lucky owner may have sold it for $1,800 . Today the same lamp could easily realize a retail price of $2,800 . Which price was the correct one ? The answer , of course , is that they all were . The time ( date ) when an antique is sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects its selling price . The place where an antique is sold ? an auction , estate sale , specialty shop ? as well as the geography ? Birmingham , Duluth , Houston , New York , San Francisco ? are factors which can not be overlooked in discussing the price of antiques . What the vendor paid for the antique is a critical consideration in its pricing . Three identical objects found in three different shops in the same city might easily have three different prices . This is simply because the dealers who have them probably paid three different prices for them , and their asking price reflects the doubling of those figures . The following section will detail those features which influence the value and price of an antique . What Affects the Price of an Antique ? Design Design is the overwhelmingly important factor in determining the value of an antique . It is design quality which has made what are now antiques desirable in any period , and it is what distinguishes them from the vast quantities of ordinary goods produced in any age . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dealers who work the local flea markets , the relative superiority of an object 's appearance strongly affects its desirability in the market , and therefore its price . The preeminence of design as a decisive element in determining an antique 's value can be easily illustrated . Two eighteenth-century chests of drawers , for example , might have been made in the same period , the same city , even the same workshop ; they may be of the same wood , the same size , in the same state of preservation , and have come from the same original owner , yet their market prices may differ dramatically . The disparity in their prices is due neither to age , provenance , nor physical condition ; it relies rather on the specific features of their respective designs . A further comparison of the two pieces in question may show that the better piece has a nicely shaped apron more integral to its overall design ; the brasses may be more carefully selected and placed ; the drawers are // graduated in size , not identical ; the drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly matched to create a rhythmic pattern . Major antique houses who offer furniture of quality to the public regularly describe the subtlety of design features as the focus of their advertisements . The wording of such ads is often as skillful as the execution of the objects themselves . Several Chippendale pieces have been described in the following way : " The execution of the piecrust edge of the single board top , squashed ball , and acanthus carved legs are exceptional " " The boldly conceived and skillfully executed cymascalloped marble top has a generous overhang and finely molded edge ; ' // and " Orderly perfection ... the piece displays a superior sense of design with its bonnet top cresting the case ! " The narrative accompanying a pilgrim piece may draw attention to a single exceptional detail of design such as " superlative vase and ring turnings : ' In an additional comparison of two other objects , design quality is still fundamental to their worth . Two early Rookwood vases , for example ( both made in 1894 , turned by the same potter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize a different price in an auction or in a shop . Once again , a comparison of design elements is critical in determining both value and cost . In any piece of decorated ceramics , it is the perfection of the shape and its relationship to the decoration which insures its success as a unified design . One pot , for example , might have a stiffly painted single blossom placed uncomfortably on an unflattering background , whereas another vase might reveal sensitively articulated floral forms which seem to grow from the field on which they are painted ; they wrap graciously around the vessel and become an integral part of its overall artistic statement . Two " flow-blue " decorated transferware Staffordshire platters from the same factory will be priced according to their quality if one has a generic English landscape on it and the other depicts the more interesting narrative scene of the Landing of Lafayette . In the design analysis of antiques , the principle of proportion can not be overemphasized ; this is perhaps particularly true in the case of furniture . Essentially a mathematical concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the relationship of parts to the whole . Proportion also has to do with the size of a piece in relation to its surroundings . Any auctioneer or dealer knows that a small , sensitively scaled sideboard or rocking chair will sell better than one which is oversized and clunky . While nevertheless magnificent , the sheer bulk of a nine-foot-high Renaissance revival Victorian bed may limit the number of potential owners because its size alone precludes its utility in many smaller living quarters . Again , it is the sophisticated dealers who call attention to this quality in their advertisements . Such ads which reveal a sensitivity to proportion may read as follows : " . . . sophisticated clock . . . the graceful proportions set off by figured crossbanding ? " . . . well-proportioned drawers r or " A fine small Baltimore sideboard with delicate fan inlay ! " Good proportion is one feature of antiquities which is either present or not ; it is integral and can not be " added on . " All the details of embellishment , fineness of finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provenance can not compensate for what is an initially clumsy piece . In any antique , the sum of the parts is always greater than any individual component no matter how magnificently wrought each may // be . It is ultimately the beauty and style of a piece , in both its particulars and in its whole , which give an antique its identity and provide its owners with lasting pleasure . The style of a piece of glass or furniture , carpet , stained glass window , or piece of silver plate is , essentially , its outward appearance . Style is composed of individual elements in a vocabulary of design motifs and features which give any designed object its character . It is style which ultimately sets objects apart from one another and gives them the identity of their respective historical periods , their geographical origins , or even their makers . The combined unity of separate , describable features makes something look Gothic , baroque , rococo , or Art Deco . It is style which makes twenty-year-old cars , five-year-old computers , or last year 's dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafts ) are easily distinguished from one another because of their contrasting styles . Their respective uses of design elements of line , form , and color are as dramatically different as is their adherence to various interpretations of the design principles of balance , proportion , emphasis , and rhythm . Attention to style and other design features in the manufacture of an object of any age is what makes it " look right " to observers . It is the familiarity with what genuine , period antiques should look like which allows an experienced collector to declare upon examining an item in question that it does or does not " feel right . " Seeing twenty pieces of eighteenth-century Wedgwood in a museum should give someone who spots the twenty-first piece in a garage sale some notion of whether or not it too is correct . While style happens deliberately , it also happens inadvertently . A " Chippendale " highboy made in the Victorian period , no matter how carefully it was copied from the eighteenth-century original , almost always has a look about it which betrays its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copier makes unknowingly . The technically accomplished , though deliberately faked , paintings in the style of Johannes Vermeer ( 1632 ? 1675 ) , so cleverly done by Han van Meegeren ( 1889 ? 1947 ) before the Second World War fooled many experts including historians , museum personnel , and private collectors . To more recent eyes , however , his " seventeenth-century " portraits have a rather twentieth-century look that went unnoticed by those living closer to the period in which the deception was accomplished . No age , it seems , can fail to impart something of its own taste and character onto the past which it admires . Developing a sensitivity to design quality and style in antiques is a skill which happens so slowly and subtly than many are willing to call it an innate talent or intuition , or believe it to be something quite magiThe Pricing of Antiques 1 1 1 cal . Curiously , after a lifetime of handling objects , some dealers and collectors are no more equipped with this attribute than are some beginners . Nevertheless , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade ? in either a buying or selling capacity . But it is a skill also achievable through a combined exposure to objects at all levels of quality ? seeing and handling a multitude of artifacts ? along with a deliberate attempt to repeatedly draw comparisons between similar examples and make judgments regarding their relative merits , or the superiority of one over the other . A thorough knowledge of what constitutes quality in antiques acquired through reading and visiting museums and other public collections , and a good memory for what one has seen , will increase a collector 's ability to make sound judgments through comparisons . Perhaps no person in the history of American antique collecting has been more renowned for possessing this sensitivity than Wallace Nutting , who , in his Furniture Treasury ( 1924 ) , underlined the importance of this sometimes elusive quality : " In collecting one must either have some feeling for style or , merely desiring to be in fashion , must have the advice of one who does have that feeling . " Condition If design quality and style are primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an antique , then the condition of that object follows closely as an important consideration in establishing its worth . Regardless of its cost , no antique or collectible is worth having if it is in poor condition . A hairline crack in a spongeware pitcher , a chip on a Galle vase , or a stain on the cover of a piece of sheet music , will never go away ; it will always directly affect the optimum value of the piece . Even a repair well done affects the character and the price of an antique adversely . Not infrequently a pair of antique objects , identical but for their condition , have been auctioned sequentially . The perfect Mettlach stein , for example , may bring $225 , while its mate , with a missing cover or cracked bottom , will sell for a fraction of that price . The auctioneer presiding at this event might , quite appropriately , remark that the imperfect piece has " a hundred-dollar crack " ; this is a lesson worth remembering . People collect for all kinds of reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For those people who regularly buy damaged shelf pieces , whose flaws , however gross , do not show when they are displayed in their crowded vitrines and on overflowing tables and shelves , any education in matters of condition is wasted . However , the sophisticated collector will always regard the good condition of an object as an essential part of its integrity and its value , and will seek it // first along with design quality and style . Condition means many things to the wary collector , but it seldom implies that an antique should " look like new . " The simple fact that an object has survived generations of use means that any expectation of a pristine condition must be tempered with a realistic view of what the vicissitudes of time and normal usage have done to its appearance . The older an object is , the greater likelihood that it has suffered greater alteration of its original state . But only the collectors of the earliest pieces such as Coptic textiles of the seventh century A.D. or of certain historic relics would be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create modern furniture based on old styles , and then proceed to " stress " their surfaces by beating them with chains , shooting them with buckshot , or drilling them to create " worm holes , " do a disservice even to these insensitive consumers by reinforcing the erroneous notion that " antique " somehow implies that a piece is in a state of decrepitude . No one buys genuine antiques because they are damaged by time ; even less so should anyone buying new items fall for this ploy . The buyer of antiques should always aspire to finding objects in as fine a condition as possible , whether their collecting specialty is tobacco tins , Art Deco atomizers , rose medallion porcelain , or tractor seats . One of the virtues of antiques over new goods of most kinds is that antiques will not only hold their value , but will usually appreciate with time . If a piece is damaged from the onset , this increase in worth will never happen . Major alterations of original condition affect the beauty of the piece as well . Advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the state of preservation with such phrases as " ... retaining its original golden color and surface " " A pair of blanket chests with original graining , hardware and cabinetwork ; ' or " . . . outstanding condition and color ! ' The surfaces of old furniture , glass , ceramics , and metals , along with all other antiquities , possess a character usually referred to as patina . All objects reveal usage by the way in which their color , texture , or shape is altered with time . A copper roof or a bronze coin develops a familiar greenish hue from exposure to weather conditions or handling . A colonial silver teaspoon will be covered with minute scratches which alter its reflective qualities ; its bowl may be worn flat on its left side from repeated scooping by generations of right-handed owners . The mahogany of a Sheraton chest of drawers will have a rich depth to its surface , particularly on its front and top , because of the successive layers of oil built up from the hands of those who used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . These normal alThe // terations are expected ( and sometimes desired ) by collectors ; they give important clues to a piece 's authenticity . Perhaps no subject relative to antique care is more controversial than that of refinishing . It is sufficient for the reader to know that natural patination is destroyed with the refinishing of a piece of furniture , and that equally destructive is the harsh and insensitive cleaning of old silver , bronze , pewter , and marble . The urge of collectors and dealers to want old things to look respectably clean and usable has taken its toll in the tens of thousands of pieces of furniture which have been " dipped and stripped " and the pewter which has been shined to look like stainless steel . On the other hand it is no pleasure to behold badly stained , scratched , and dented wood ; the rubbing of wood with pumice or cleaning it with appropriate materials is preferable to stripping , sanding , and polyurethaning to make the old look new . Beyond the patination of surface there are other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent value as well as the market value of an antique . Among these are the completeness of an object and the originality of its parts . Does an object have all of the parts original to it ? An attractive , decorative Gouda pottery inkwell , otherwise perfect , may be missing its insert to hold the ink , or the original ceramic one has been replaced by one of glass . A Queen Anne highboy base , separated years earlier from its upper case of drawers , might be wedded with the top from another piece which has lost its bottom . This , appropriately , is called a marriage ? a term which , in the trade , refers to the act of making a complete object from parts of several others . " Marriages " of other kinds are sometimes honestly described in dealer and auction catalog jargon as assembled . The phrase , " Chinese export assembled tea and coffee service , circa 18107 means that the various pieces of porcelain were not originally made to compose a single set , but rather pieces from various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by someone wishing to have a complete collection . There is no good reason why collectors with sensitivity can not perform their own assembling . Many a separated Art Nouveau glass lampshade has made its way to an appropriate bronze base through the intervention of a dealer or collector who knew what was originally supposed to go with what . Plenty of orphan glass inserts for Victorian caster sets have been matched up and fitted into silver stands which had lost their originals . In the larger sense , of course , all collecting is the reassembling of the past ? historic restoration projects being the most visible , large-scale production of the sort . The general shortage of good , early antiques for all those who // desire to own them causes not only the assembling of matching sets to accommodate these markets , but also finds a considerable percentage of antiques on the market to be altered from their original state . This is particularly true of furniture , which is more easily repaired than glass , porcelain , or metal . The normal use of furniture , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original condition . Like a lost button on a coat , the loss of a handle on a chest of drawers may require the replacement of all the hardware rather than trying to find a match for the original . Replaced hardware is easily detected by examination of the patination ( discoloration ) around the handles on the front , and on the interior of the drawers by looking for signs of position change in the hardware ( evidenced by new , or additional , holes and tampered wood surfaces ) . The Pricing of Antiques 1 15 How much alteration from the original condition of a piece is acceptable to a collector or a dealer is largely a matter of personal taste . The upper-crust establishments who are the vendors of the greatest antiquities tolerate very little . " Minor repairs to the drawer edge " " Some interior repair ' or even " a rich old finish " ( which means not the original finish ) are the usual caveats in their promotion of their inventory . Other dealers and collectors , less particular about total originality , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental rugs with rewoven ? or even missing ? edges , a new drawer bottom on a pembroke table , or a 1910 wedding dress without the accompanying veil . Only a fool would dismiss the value of a Hepplewhite chest-on-chest because several backboards , or a leg , had been replaced . Change in the original integrity of any antique causes a lessening of its price . But because repair is a relative matter , every buyer needs to consider how much change is acceptable personally . Curiously , dealers in some European countries , where a greater number of very early pieces are available , hold to unwritten , though broadly accepted , standards of what percentage of repairs and replacements are appropriate on a piece of antique furniture . In Holland , an antique needs to be only 40% original to pass as legitimate . In Denmark a figure closer to 60% is acceptable . Dealers who sell objects as antique when they do not meet these standards are , in fact , subject to legal action . Unscrupulous dealers have been known to make deliberate alterations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of increasing their market value . This is called embellishment or enhancement of a piece . It is well known that a mahogany and satinwood Federal chest is more desirable if its apron contains an inlaid shell or fan motif , rather than being plain . An extra banded inlay along the top of a sewing table makes it more attractive . The plain , turned maple legs of a Sheraton table can be made to look like more desirable curly maple by spiralling a kerosene-soaked rope around them and briefly letting it burn to discolor the wood in a striped pattern . Curly maple also may be convincingly " created " by brushing diluted India ink in stripes across the grain of ordinary maple before it is varnished . All of these embellishments are easily accomplished relative to the increase in selling price which might be realized from the more elaborate piece . There are certainly known cases of obliging older ladies who have innocently painted copper tea leaves onto easily found plain white nineteenth-century English stoneware on order from dealers who had a demand for the decorated tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy as painting tea leaves is the embellishment of plain salt-glazed stoneware crocks with cobalt decoration . The presence of a // beautifully painted number , flower , bird , or , best of all , an American flag or an eagle , on an ordinary crock can boost its market price by hundreds of dollars . If a kiln is available , this task is simplicity itself , and well worth the trouble for those without conscience . Not a few bored dealers with nothing better to do have hand-colored early engravings with their box of watercolors , to accommodate contemporary tastes ? even in full view of their confused customers . Lamp repair shops have been known to remove the wired-on or soldered-on labels from a Tiffany or Handel lamp left by a customer , and place it on an unsigned lamp of their own to enhance its market appeal . Old paintings in the marketplace not only have had signatures added to increase their importance , but have had other pictorial features painted in to make an otherwise ordinary landscape , for example , more interesting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many observers , uniqueness and rarity are synonymous with antiquity , though this is not supported in fact . Regardless of how precious they may seem to their owners , Wedgwood jasperware , Mason 's ironstone , Currier and Ives prints , Haviland china , and pressed pattern glass were manufactured by the thousands or even millions of pieces when they were new . At the time of their creation , they were neither unique ( the only one ever made ) nor were they rare ( unplentiful ) . Today most of these pieces are still quite common , and their relatively modest market prices reflect their plentiful supply . Some of these pieces have become less common through the damage and loss to others of their kind in the intervening years ? but few are rare ; none , probably , are unique . Uniqueness in the antique market is always problematic . Because the value and to some extent the significance of a work of art or an antique is usually based upon its comparative relationship with other similar examples , an object of singular character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poses problems for both seller and buyer in establishing its " correct price . " In the improbable event that the magnificent ( and unique ) gold salt cellar once owned by Francis I ? the only extant and documented work by Renaissance goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini ? were suddenly to appear on the market , it would be virtually impossible to assign a price to it . Likewise , settling on a figure that adequately reflected the value of Michelangelo 's only signed work , the Pieta , a piece of furniture proven to be from the hand of Thomas Chippendale himself ( none are yet certain to be by him ) , or the Dead Sea Scrolls , would be a challenging task indeed . The Pricing of Antiques 11 7 In circles outside the marketplace , one frequently hears the phrase " priceless antiques , " a meaningless term if there ever was one . No object , even unique like Cellini 's masterpiece , is without a price which someone would be willing to pay for it , and the price for great and rare objects is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public auction . Observing the appreciating value of unique objects is a fascinating , if largely academic , pursuit . The 1856 British Guiana one-cent stamp , printed because of an emergency shortage , and in the wrong color , is universally regarded as the world 's rarest postage stamp . It is , for all intents and purposes , unique , as no others of its kind have ever been identified . The stamp , originally worth only a penny , was sold in 1872 to a local dealer in Georgetown , British Guiana , for six shillings . After the First World War , the stamp was sold for $32,500 , and again in 1970 for $284,000 . Ten years later its sale brought over $1 million . Rarity alone will not guarantee a high value to any given object . Some artifacts which might accurately be described as unique still have little monetary value because they lack the more important qualities of innate beauty , historical significance , or desirability . The only quilt ever made by one 's own great-grandmother , or a singular hand-carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would probably not realize an enormous auction price because it has a limited market appeal . For most collectors , the potential for discovering an object which can truly be called " unique " is slim . Even if such an object were to be found , the chance of recognizing its significance without a basis for comparison would be equally remote . Rarity , rather than uniqueness , might more properly be a concern for an experienced collector . While uniqueness refers to one , rarity may be used to describe the supply of several or even many similar objects . A case in point would be a Gutenberg Bible . In the fifteenth century the German printer Johannes Gutenberg developed moveable type and an edition of 185 Bibles , believed to have been printed at least in part by him , was produced . To date 48 copies are known to exist . The discovery of additional copies , or the appearance of a copy on the market , always generates considerable interest and speculation as to what it might bring . In 1975 the 48th copy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German pastor . At the time , it was appraised at $3.2 million and donated to a museum . Subsequent sales of known copies have brought even more , such as the one sold in 1987 for $5.39 million . Other fifteenth-century religious books , printed in even fewer numbers , may never achieve this price . Gutenberg Bibles in general are valuable because they are rare and historically significant ( because they were the first books printed with the newly discovered 1 18 ANTIQUE COLLECTING moveable type ) . The most recently sold copy was specifically valuable because , unlike many of the other surviving versions , it was in pristine condition , its pages clean and fresh , and in its original Mainz binding . Pilgrim furniture , almost by virtue of its definition , is rare , because so little of it was made for the then meager population of America . Trestle tables , chair tables , press cupboards , and Brewster chairs made before 1700 are so few that most are in museums , and , in the rare instances when they are offered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny before very high prices are paid for them . Furniture from the hand , or even from the workshop , of an identifiable eighteenth-century cabinetmaker is nearly always considered to be rare . Over several generations , one of the great firms , Townsend and Goddard of Newport , Rhode Island , produced superlative pieces of distinctively designed and crafted furniture . While several hundred pieces made by the firm are still extant , almost any one of them will bring a fine price . In 1985 the highest price ever paid at auction for a piece of American furniture was a Townsend and Goddard kneehole block-front desk which brought $375,000 . Of these desks there are only a handful , and most are owned by public museums . Rarity , of course , considers not only how many objects were originally made which yet remain , but also how many are available on the market . There are , for example , several hundred Rembrandt paintings in museums ( thus they are not rare in the sense of numbers ) , but more appropriately affecting their market value is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since museums owning Rembrandts are unlikely to sell them , the only ones of consequence to the potential buyer ( which will probably be another museum ) are those few still in private hands , which , someday , may be sold . Pre-Reformation English silver , Renaissance costumes , or classical sculpture also fall into similar categories of lack of availability , and thus command high prices . On the few occasions when it is applicable , dealers in fine furniture refer to the rarity of pieces they have for sale . An ad may read , " One of three known blanket chests of this type from Schwaben Creek Valley , Pennsylvania , " " ... rare William and Mary maple and ash round-top tavern table ' or even " A rare and possibly unique Hepplewhite grain-painted maple and pine console table . " In the various descriptions of items the rarity may refer to that of provenance , shape , or decoration , as in the three preceding examples . Certain quite common objects become valuable if they are variations or aberrations from the majority of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups from the period 1880 ? 1910 ( as well as many hundreds of collectors of them ) , a very small percentage of these cups are left-handed ones . Even the // circumstance of being left handed in the past century was considered by many to be a social and moral stigma , and mustache cups deliberately crafted for left-handed customers are a distinct rarity . Even rarer are silver mustache spoons . Violins by Italian masters Antonio Stradivari or Joseph Guarneri have brought record-breaking prices , over $200,000 in some instances . No matter how productive , violin makers , like furniture makers , produce only so many works in a lifetime , and the relatively few masterpieces among them bring the highest prices to buyers who can discriminate between the ordinary and the superlative . // Provenance Numberless are the estate sales and auctions to which novices flock because the worldly goods or excess baggage ( sometimes quite literally ) of some political luminary , underworld figure , or movie star are being sold to the public . In the minds of these people , ordinary objects such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a pipe are transformed into relics of special significance because they were owned by Bing Crosby . A tea set owned by Adolf Hitler , adorned with eagles , swastikas , and the initials " A.H. , " draws crowds at an auction . Likewise , General Douglas MacArthur 's 1942 Packard was sold in 1979 for $150,000 . Other golf balls , silver services , and Packards not owned by celebrities do not enjoy these inflated prices , and their sales regularly go unnoticed . In 1976 a monogrammed pair of drawers , and another in 1977 , once owned by Queen Victoria were sold for $107 and $280 respectively . On a higher plane , when the much-awaited public auction of the Duchess of Windsor 's legendary jewelry collection finally took place in 1987 , even the distinguished auction house doing the sale was astounded by the prices which individual pieces brought . Of considerable interest to observers of this event was the fact that , almost without exception , the great jewels realized figures very close to their estimates , whereas less important pieces with engraved sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic merit , for that matter . Ownership of a personal token which was a gift of King Edward VIII to the woman he loved , is , apparently , worth more than its weight in gold . Provenance refers to the origin or source of an object . In broader definition , it is the history of the ownership of an object . Who owned an object can be an appropriate and legitimate reason for an increase in its market value , though it is almost always linked with some other factor affecting worth , such as beauty or historic importance . In perusing the best auction catalogs , one frequently finds reference to former owners in the description of single lots or entire collections ; indeed , auction houses seem to prefer offering for sale items which have belonged in the collections of the great . " From the collection of Mrs. Francis P . Garvan , Jr. , " ... the collection of Colonel Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbish , New York ; ' and " ... the property of the Duke of Devonshire " are typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regularity . If anonymity is requested by the vendor , or if the seller does not have an easily recognized name , the descriptive line simply may state " The property of a Lady " or " The property of a Gentleman // A rare Queen Anne highboy , sold by John Walton Inc. in 1987 , was advertised in the following way : " Written on a fragment of a revolutionary War Military Pass glued inside a drawer are the names Jesse Birchard and Norwich : ' The Birchard family was one of the original settlers of Norwich , Connecticut . In addition to the highboy itself , representing the highest form of Connecticut cabinetmaking , this provenance enriches its connections with history . Likewise , a pair of Queen Anne chairs sold by a Massachusetts firm , described as the Gov . Gideon Wanton Chairs , were characterized as follows : " These chairs were part of the furnishings of the Nichols-Wanton-Hunter House and descended directly through the family until recently purchased by us . " The establishment of provenance for some objects is exceedingly important ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . The best provenance for a painting , for example , is to be able to trace it directly to the artist 's studio in which it was created . The legendary and mysterious portrait popularly referred to as Mona Lisa is one of the few paintings by the artist known to have been in the possession of Leonardo da Vinci at the time of his death . For some buyers , there is a certain assurance in knowing that the antiquity being sold belonged to someone renowned for having a collection of quality ; it is an immediate pedigree . For other buyers , a famous name alone connected with a piece , regardless of its quality , is enough to give it distinction and desirability . In 1980 , within five minutes after the bidding opened at $36,000 , a mahogany bed decorated with bronze ormolu mounts of Venus and Cupid and a Napoleonic eagle was sold at auction in Berne , Switzerland , for $126,000 . The piece was reputed to have been a " Wedding Bed " made for Napoleon Bonaparte . With a provenace equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pails made for Marie Antoinette was sold in 1978 for a record Sevres price of $102,600 . To assuage her ennui , it seems , the bored queen dressed in a peasant costume and gamboled about the lawn pretending to be a milkmaid . In 1982 a pair of pistols of supreme quality was found in the New York City police property warehouse along with other illegal weapons . Their quality , and the initials inlaid in gold , indicated that they had been made by the eighteenth-century imperial gunmaker Johan Adolph Grecke for his empress , Catherine the Great . Upon being given to the Metropolitan Museum , they were estimated to be worth $200,000 . Described as " true works of art , " clearly their quality , as well as the distinction of their ownership , was important in establishing their high value . A home movie , distinguished from all others because it was taken for fun by the Beatles while they were making a professional film , brought thousands of dollars beyond its estimate in a 1987 auction . // 1988 proved to be another year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the final day of a four-day auction of the partial contents of Liberace 's various plush domiciles , the entertainer 's driver 's license , forecast to garner no more than $200 , went for $4,150 . Similarly the estate of pop artist Andy Warhol was auctioned amid a frenzy of interest from the art world as well as popular culture devotees . The hype surrounding the auction made national television news and a Newsweek cover entitled " Art for Money 's Sake . " The illustrated sixvolume catalog of the Warhol auction , itself now a collector 's item , was available for $95 . Of all the unexpectedly high prices realized at the sale , perhaps the most memorable was that achieved by the artist 's rather random collection of 1950s cookie jars . Lot number 838 , listed as four American cookie jars , estimated to sell for $100-200 , was actually sold for $11,550 . Another lot of miscellaneous cookie jars , some incomplete , brought $12,100 , exactly $12,000 more than the low estimate established by the auction house . It should be stressed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased in antique shops and flea markets across the country for $27.50 apiece . It is unlikely that the enthusiastic buyer of this lot could turn around and sell the same collection at any time in the future for a figure even remotely approaching the one he or she paid . Historical Significance In the case of famous owners , it is difficult to separate the person who owned an object from its historical significance . Clearly anything which was owned by Louis XIV , including his chamberpot , would have some historical importance by virtue of the fact that he was king of France . It is also difficult to determine what part ownership and quality each plays in the evaluation of the fine property of a powerful figure . A Louis XIV chamberpot , like a pair of pistols of the Tsarina , is likely to have been made better , and more distinctively , because it was specifically intended for a person of importance ; thus its price is affected . The items listed in the previous section , owned by famous people , take on additional significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come . Few objects , or even written descriptions of the period , for example , could reveal as poignantly the corrupted state of the French aristocracy in the last days of the monarchy as the hand-painted porcelain milk pails of Marie Antoinette . In the fall of 1988 , a pair of ruby slippers believed to have been worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz , and also known to collectors of Hollywood memorabilia as the " witch 's shoes , " was privately sold by Christie 's for $165,000 . The cult followers of Judy Garland and // Or artificially created this unrealistic price unrelated to the actual value of the shoes . Some objects are valuable solely because they have historical significance , and not because of any intrinsic qualities of beauty or worth which they might possess . Most documents on paper which testify to the interactions of people and nations fall into this category . The several versions of Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address or of the Magna Carta , the original manuscript for Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures under Ground , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spontaneous home movie of Abraham Zapruder , who happened to have his camera operating in Dallas on November 22 , 1963 , when John F. Kennedy 's motorcade passed by , is entirely due to its historical and documentary nature and not to its artistry . George Washington 's several sets of false teeth , now enjoying museum settings , are similarly significant because of their place in history . Objects of this kind , however , can not be categorized strictly as " antiques " in the sense in which the term is used throughout this book . If it were not so important a feature of Great Britain 's history , the chair upon which all the kings and queens of England have been crowned since 1296 would be worth no more than any other piece of Gothic furniture if its value were based entirely upon its physical features . The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot at Ford 's Theater is no different from hundreds of other Victorian chairs which are regularly sold for a few hundred dollars , except for its unfortunate role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country are the repositories for ordinary objects which have been given more than ordinary attention because of their presence in some memorable event . " The first softball , " " Part of the rigging of the Mayflower " or " Glasses worn by an early Methodist ; ' are typical labels found in museums to justify the presence of otherwise common things behind glass . For decades , the Hennepin County Historical Society in Minneapolis displayed a caned rocker of a usual late Victorian sort with the sinister label , " A Murderer Sat In This Chair : ' Handsome Harry Hayward , who had paid to have his female creditor murdered in 1895 , apparently spent a few anxious moments in this chair while waiting to be hanged . The object was seized by witnesses and preserved ( along with the handcuffs which manacled him and a piece of the rope which hanged him ) as valuable because of its connection with the grim event . The link with history is a consideration in buying an antique which is not without its pitfalls . The collector needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are not associated with world-changing , unusual , or even curious events . Regrettably , most objects have become dissociated from their stories through the passage of // time . For this very reason , many collectors have lamented the fact that their antiques could not " talk " to reveal their stories . The danger for collectors in ascribing undue importance to the historical value of an object is to miss the most important reason for its ownership ? its inherent worth and the beauty of the object itself and what it tells of society in a broader sense . Auctioneers , dealers , and those who sell privately delight in conveying specific historical legends about the objects they are vending to increase their appeal to the buyer . They are regularly armed with phrases such as , " I bought it from a very wealthy banker in Atlanta , " " It came out of a seventeenth-century house in Salem , or " This bugle was played at the dedication of the Washington Monument : ' The tiny Mayflower could never have accommodated all the objects attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose later ancestors have claimed their passage on the same . The worth of an antique must be judged first by what it is and not upon who owned it or where it was used . Historical information enriches the appreciation of objects , but can not compensate for other qualities which are missing . Pairs and Complete Sets Objects made in multiples , intended from their origins to be pairs or sets , whose companion pieces still exist , are more valuable than equal numbers of comparable individual examples . Candlesticks , dueling pistols , flatware , dining chairs , salt casters , and garniture , almost without exception , were made this way . In addition , many vases , figurines , and pieces of bedroom and dining-room furniture were originally made to be in pairs or en suite . An eighteenth-century pair of Chelsea figures of a shepherd and shepherdess commands a price more than double that of either separate piece . The intact nature of pairs or sets is directly related to condition in antique collecting . Recognizing this fact , many insurance companies allow full compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of items is lost . Naturally , they also have the right of possession of the remaining piece after the monetary settlement . The desirability of complete sets mentioned earlier is such that many collectors attempt to re-create them from components found here and there . While this kind of assembled collection is a legitimate pursuit , the desire for creating " sets " sometimes goes beyond the bounds of good taste , reason , or legality . One such illustration should suffice in alerting the antique collector to be cautious when buying sets . A set of four American Queen Anne side chairs , for example , would be a delight for even the most discriminating collector to own . But a set of six would be infinitely better , and a set of eight , nearly divine . A dishonest vendor , possessing some skill and nerve , could create a set of six chairs // from four by reassembling their parts and replacing some of each original chair with enough new , faked pieces to create two additional chairs with some genuine parts . The task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully accomplished , the effort would be well rewarded in the difference of cash realized between four and six // matching eighteenth-century chairs . More commonly found in the trade than fraudulently re-created sets are sets of chairs which are assembled by gathering together very similar , though not absolutely matched , ex amples . A very careful inspection of finish , proportion , and profile will reveal this fact . Sets of chairs , incidentally , are frequently numbered under their slip seats with a Roman numeral . If someone is selling a " set " of chairs which have nonconsecutive numbers , it is a certainty that the set originally contained more pieces which are now missing . Signatures and Dates There is little disagreement that the presence of a signature or date on a work of art or an antique does have some bearing on its evaluation . Whether it should or not is probably open to some discussion . If we did n't know who wrote , composed , or painted anything , we might be better able to appreciate every artistic work more rightly for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For collectors cat eighteenth-century objects the hero might be Gainsborough , Herold , or Wedgwood ; for the nineteenth century , Landseer , William Morris , or Louis Comfort Tiffany ; to collectors of the twentieth century , the names of Picasso , Frank Lloyd Wright , and Charles Eames are synonymous with greatness in the objects they created . It is only natural , then , that many sellers of antiques wish to link their objects with the perceived glory of these heroic figures . In this feeble pursuit , many a naive dealer has shown an even more gullible buyer a picture from a book on fine antiques , which bore only the vaguest relationship to the piece they were selling , and claimed it to be " just like it . " When antiques and works of art not only resemble accepted great examples , but possess signatures and dates , their credentials seem complete ? they have a pedigree , a specific identity . Much to the chagrin of collectors and dealers , most antiques are neither signed nor dated . Objects made in their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived in them by later admirers , were not considered important enough to document with a name , place , or date connected with their manufacture . Those who specialize in collecting artist-decorated Rookwood pottery , English silver , or certain American coverlets are fortunate that both signatures and dates are nearly always present ? imbedded in the object ; other collectors are not so lucky . Authorship , age , and other matters regarding the origin of most antiques must be deduced from the objects themselves ? from their style and condition . Some kinds of antiques are more likely to be signed than others . Potters seem to sign their work more frequently than some other craftsmen ? perhaps because it is so easy to // match into the damp clay or brush on with the glaze . The appearance a signed piece of furniture on the market is such a rarity that it almost always causes dealers to make specific reference to it in their advertising . A tall-case clock might be described as " ... bearing its original paper label " ; a chest of drawers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Renaissance revival sofa frame , " Signed in chalk on the seat rail , jelliff ' " An inordinate dependence upon signatures to confirm quality in ( antiques or works of art may lead a collector to overlook more important features , or , indeed , to ignore the possibility that the signature is a forgery . Ordinary unsigned late eighteenth-century American silver spoons have occasionally later been stamped with the name " REVERE " make them saleable for a price hundreds of dollars more than they might otherwise have commanded . In the days when skilled labor was cheaper , the entire center of a damaged silver tray ( with family crest on one side and hallmarks on the other ) , or the bottom of an irreparable sterling teapot stamped with good hallmarks , were removed and cleverly joined to similar vessels which had less distinguished marks . To the unwary buyer , they would appear to be worth much more because of their better hallmarks . Apparently the market contained enough novice buyers , who depended on the markings rather than the total integrity of a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were easily placed in their hands . Falsified signatures on paintings are found in museums as well as In private collections with some regularity . Many pictures of the seventeenth century , including some genuine Rembrandts , bear false Rembrandt signatures because someone at one time thought it would give the object ? even the real one ? greater credibility . All other factors being equal ( which they seldom are ) , a genuine signature on a genuine painting is a good thing to have , but it probably affects price relatively little . Many of the greatest paintings and sculptures of the world are unsigned . Mediocre works of art are not worth having , regardless of whose signature they possess . The authenticity of paintings is established by their comparison with other documented works and their stylistic and thematic consistency with other known works . And like the value of any other antiquity , true value is inherent in its design and the competence of its execution ? not in who did or did not sign it . Sometimes the presence of a signature or date on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique collecting one occasionally comes across an object of genuine antiquity which bears embellishment ? decoration , date , or name ? added sometime after the piece itself was made . Typical instances in which this is likely to occur might be on a Norwegian immigrant trunk , an eighteenth-century Ger128 ANTIQUE COLLECTING man glass beaker , or a silver teapot . A Scandinavian trunk might easily have been made in the late eighteenth century ; and , when a family member decided to emigrate to America in the 1870s , the piece was then painted with the traveler 's name , point of destination , and date . Likewise , a certain percentage of such items as a Germanic handblown Waldglasbecker ( or beaker ) , many of which were intended to remain plain , were decorated a century later , when they were more appreciated , with colored enamel flowers , armorial themes , or dates , by someone who realized their greater market appeal . Other old glass , and certainly many pieces of silver , have had perfectly legitimate inscriptions engraved on them later for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engraved silver , after it leaves the possession of the unfamiliar family or organization for whom it was personalized , actually becomes less valuable on the market . There would be few interested buyers , for example , for even a fine Victorian silver teapot if it bore the inscription " To the Reverend Cecil Clark on the Occasion cat the Fortieth Anniversary of his Pastorate at St. Stephen 's " Thus , many an engraved sentiment has been removed from the face of a piece of silver by hammering and polishing until it is no more . The removal , however , is seldom entirely invisible , and a clever silver buyer by fogging the surface with breath should be able to reveal momentarily the ghost of any engraving which remains almost imperceptible . Antiques which once bore signatures may no longer hold them because of later circumstances . Many a legitimate signature on a painting has disappeared when the picture was vigorously overcleaned . Paper labels which once identified the manufacturer of art glass and art pottery have dried out and fallen off by the thousands . Both Handel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the felt padding of their bases and have come unglued . Signatures and dates may easily come and go from antiques or fakes , and the wary collector should base the decision to purchase a piece first on its quality and condition , and last on whether or not it is signed . Popularity There are few greater pleasures for the antique collector than being able to buy something at a good price because no one else recognizes , understands , or appreciates it for its true value . The reason that this happens less often than one would hope is , in part , because the history of antique collecting , along with the marketing of any other commodity , is heavily affected by the popularity of the items being vended ; most people collect popular , mainstream artifacts and most collectors follow , rather than set , trends . Many people imagine that // antiques , the very symbols of continuity , stability , and conservatism , are exempt from the caprices of public taste and the whims of popularity . However , merely sitting quite regularly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collector to the fact that antiques Iso enjoy periods of popular approval , as well as ones of public coolness or even scorn . The interest in some antiques and collectibles is almost seasonal . he same wicker furniture which prompts frantic bidding in the spring nd early summer may be met by a winter crowd with considerable ndifference . Old stained-glass windows and brass beds were so popular in the 1960s and ' 70s that no dealer could keep enough of them in stock . Such was the frenzy for decorative windows that many a dealer at the time was offered stolen ones , ripped from their original settings to supply a market so demanding that even thieves were aware of it . Since the growing affection for both stained glass and brass beds , prompted in part by eclectic decorating trends shown in popular magazines , could not meet the available supply of genuine ones , even new reproductions moved in to fill the gap . Today neither stained glass nor brass beds are nearly as popular as they once were . Like golden oak furniture , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and some dealers , entering the market too late , got stuck having paid top dollar for invento ? ry once popular , which they could not sell to an audience with waning interest . Observing the importance of popularity of certain kinds of antiques in the market over many years and even decades is even more Instructive than seeing the short run . In March , 1980 , the New York Times published a chart which tracked the favorites in American furniture over every decade of the twentieth century . Ratings of popularity were described in five stages : peaking , popular , gaining , emerging , and unwanted . The study , based on the tracking of auction prices for single or related pieces , indicated that at the turn of the century , pilgrim furniture was at its height . In 1920 , furniture from the William and Mary period enjoyed its greatest appreciation to date , and Federal furniture first peaked then . The appeal of Queen Anne and Chippendale has either gradually risen or leveled off in the last eighty years , without major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture made by the utopian Shaker communities , first appearing on the national market about 1930 , had its highest peak of popularity in the 1960s when the nation saw peace rallies , the return to the earth movement , and an increased interest in ecology and natural foods . Large sections of the country , it seems , were exhibiting a temperament with spiritual ties to Shaker beliefs of simplicity and concord ( though not the less popular celibacy ) . The Times study shows the late entrance into the market of // the more recent styles of the golden oak era ( 1945 ) , arts and crafts ( 1956 ) , and Art Deco ( 1972 ) . If the price and availability of American period furniture , now a constant feature of the inventory of the greatest dealers , can have been affected by popularity , then it is safe to assume that lesser items are even more vulnerable to the uncertainties of fad or fashion . On an entirely different level , the interest in collecting baseball cards has seen an enormous growth of popularity among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States which more or less exclusively limited their business to the selling of such cards . By 1987 this figure had multiplied to over 1,000 shops . Certainly the increased interest in professional sports teams , and the continuing production and availability of cards which featured emerging sports superstars , is in large part responsible for such market reaction to something which might be viewed as an investment vehicle . The international picture trade , which deals in paintings , drawings , and prints , is affected not only by the popularity of the work of certain artists , but curiously by the popularity of the subjects they have depicted . The art historian who views pictures does so with an eye for the quality of the art itself , for its style , beauty , and competence of execution . The possible obscurity , or even the disagreeable nature of the subject is largely irrelevant . For scholars , themes such as The Blessed Transportation of the House of Levi , lad and Sisera , or The Flaying of Marsyius , have little bearing on a picture 's intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest because of the arcane subject . Dealers , however , view things differently . Antique dealers appropriately handle pictures which the public likes ; they seek art with popular themes and agreeable subjects which are not disturbing to viewers . They want landscapes , flower paintings , and portraits of attractive people , preferably young and well-dressed . This is a tendency not usually found in sales galleries which deal exclusively in fine art . But it is nearly endemic among antique dealers , who , almost universally , are confused when confronting original art and are incapable of discerning its value beyond the clues provided by signature or subject matter . Most antique dealers know that religious images represented in pictures , sculpture , figurines , or in other artifacts , do not sell well , and that pictures of obscure saints or martyrdoms make even religious people nervous . They also know that , even if equal in quality , pictures of horses sell better than pictures of cows ; that male nudes , because they are rarer , often bring more money from certain buyers , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed , however , portraits of women sell better because of their more interesting costume // matures . Among studio paintings , pictures of flowers have more buyers than still lifes with dead rabbits . For the connoisseur of pictures , capable of determining quality and authenticity , the buying of paintings , drawings , and prints can bring both aesthetic and monetary rewards . few are the antique dealers who really understand pictures , and many overlook their true merit . Thus the practice of specializing for the col1e tor , once again , gives an advantage to the painting or print connoisseur over the vendor . The popularity of certain kinds of antiques is often subject to regional as well as global variations . Collectors who are familiar with the international picture know that objects are often most appreciated in the country of their origin . Collectibles related to the British royal family , for example , are most dearly prized ( and priced ) in England , while these same items have many fewer interested buyers in the United States . Naturally , the plentiful supply makes antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , which has a lengthier history , Federal furniture is collected with great regularity because it is both familiar and available . But in the midwest , or even west , where early furniture is scarce , oak furniture originally distributed by the catalog houses from 1900 to 1920 is much more recognized , has many devotees , and brings high prices . What causes antiques to be popular is a subject which should be of considerable interest to the collector . Popularity seems to be generally unaffected by the actual potential supply of the item itself . For generations , art historians have known that art prices increase dramatically with new scholarship written to give new focus to a particular artist or school . Articles in scholarly journals , and even complete monographs , have brought artists of sometimes well-deserved obscurity into the light of day , and consequently their sale prices are affected positively . Clever historians have been known to quietly assemble private caches of works by " their man " and then publish the definitive essay on him , happily sitting back to watch their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their intuition . The rising prices in recent years of the works of Mannerist painters , or of the Pre-Raphaelites , or even of certain commercial illustrators of the last century are instances of appreciation attributed directly to new scholarship and the accompanying reappraisal of their significance in the art world . The rest of the antique market is similarly affected , and the importance of publications in transmitting enthusiasm for an area of collecting can not be overstated . New books , continually being published , define yet some new specialty that can be collected . Sometimes these sources will identify a particular designer or design firm ( Chase Art Deco metal work , Gouda
