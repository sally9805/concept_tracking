The ingredients for violence were similar : angry crowds of young people , edgy police officers determined to enforce the law , sensitive social issues with no easy answers . In both Britain and West Germany last week , those volatile components ignited into bloody street rioting . The violence revealed an appetite for lawlessness among young people convinced they live in societies unresponsive to their problems . <P> In both countries , high unemployment among youth was cited as a contributing factor . In Britain , angry crowds of blacks gave vent to feelings of injustice . In West Germany , where thousands of youths rampaged in 16 cities , the instigators seemed to be experienced rabble-rousers in search of an arena for their violence . They found it in Frankfurt , where a branch of the right-wing National Democratic Party had scheduled a weekend meeting . Because the N.D.P. is regarded by many as a haven for neo-Nazis , its gatherings inevitably bring protests . After demonstrators held a peaceful rally , several hundred hooligans , mostly young , some wearing hoods and black leather jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police brought out a water-cannon truck . As it sped to the scene , the vehicle ran over a protester , killing him . <P> Chanting " Police murderers ! " and " Fascists ! " the crowd smashed windows , looted shops and burned cars . Similar outbreaks occurred in Stuttgart , West Berlin , Munich , Hamburg and other major cities . After five days of violence , dozens of people had been injured and about 500 detained . Police believe many of the rioters were left-wing provocateurs affiliated with terrorist groups . Frankfurt 's police spokesman called the troublemakers in his city " professional rowdies who enjoy destruction under some pretext of political motivation . " <P> The violence in Britain began in Brixton , a south London district with a predominantly black West Indian population . In two nights of arson and looting , 74 people were injured and more than 200 arrested . Brixton was especially hard hit by race riots in 1981 , and the wounds they left had only just begun to heal . <P> ! The trigger for the violence was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a teenager who was suspected of possessing a sawed-off shotgun . The youth 's mother confronted the police after they had battered down her front door . Apparently fearing that the armed youth was inside , a police inspector fired a .38-cal. pistol . The shot struck the woman , leaving her paralyzed from the waist down . As word of the shooting spread , crowds gathered outside the Brixton Road police station and began throwing gasoline bombs and bricks . Rampaging youths , some as young as 13 , looted businesses , set fire to cars and poured oil on roadways . Reporters who arrived to cover the rioting were beaten . Two white women were raped . Later in the week , rioting broke out in the port city of Liverpool 's Toxteth district , also the scene of racial disturbances in 1981 . <P> British authorities refused to blame blacks as a group for causing the riots . Police Commander Alex Marnoch , whose district includes Brixton , charged that " the criminal and hooligan element took advantage of the situation for their own ends . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless violence in both countries .
