Even diligent readers of the financial pages may be feeling bewildered by the goings-on in the banking industry . One day the headlines are proclaiming good times and rising profits for most financial institutions . Next day they are telling of bank failures and bailouts . <P> Despite five years of expansion by the U.S. economy as a whole , many banks and savings and loan associations are racked by troubles in the farm belt , depressed conditions in the oil patch and unwise real estate ventures all over the country . While the large majority are solidly in the black , the weakest institutions are in such bad shape that they threaten to exhaust the multibillion-dollar Government insurance funds that protect depositors . If that happens , taxpayers will have to come to the rescue . Federal regulators are confident they can clean up the mess before it overwhelms the financial system , but if the U.S. falls into a recession in the next year or two , the problems in banking will grow much worse . <P> The staggering cost of correcting the situation came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank Board , which regulates thrift institutions , announced a two-part bailout of 20 Texas S and Ls that could ultimately cost the Government $6.8 billion . First , the Bank Board conducted a fire sale of twelve failing Texas institutions , including Richardson Savings ( assets : $707.8 million ) and Mercury Savings ( $332.9 million ) . The S and Ls will be merged and turned over to an investment group led by William Gibson , an executive vice president at Chicago 's Continental Illinois bank , for a token $48 million . To attract the investors and revive the S and Ls , the Bank Board agreed to provide financial aid that may run as high as $1.3 billion over the next decade . <P> . The real shocker came a day later , when the Bank Board announced the largest rescue in its history . It plans to merge eight nearly moribund Texas S and Ls  --  including Dallas ' Sunbelt Savings , which lost $1.2 billion in the first three months of 1988 alone  --  into one financial organization with assets of $6.9 billion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as $5.5 billion over the next ten years . Although the Bank Board had several offers to buy all eight S and Ls , it determined they were in such bad financial and legal shape that it would ultimately prove less expensive for the Government to run them . <P> The Bank Board 's moves are part of its so-called Southwest Plan for consolidating 109 ailing Texas S and Ls by the end of next May . The thinking behind the mergers is that the firms will save money by combining and streamlining operations and thus stand a better chance of survival . But the rescue plans will put a severe strain on the already cash-starved Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ( FSLIC ) , the industry insurance fund that provides the money for the bailouts . <P> Last week 's big S and L deals followed by less than a month the Government 's rescue of Dallas-based First RepublicBank , the second largest bank bailout in history . NCNB , a thriving Charlotte , N.C. , banking company , has agreed to take over management of First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will have to provide $4 billion  --  an amount topped only by the $4.5 billion bailout of Chicago 's Continental Illinois in 1984.
