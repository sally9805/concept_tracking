At the age of 18 months , he was pronounced a genius . By the time he was 10 , he had written a critique of Nietzsche ' s " Thus Spake Zarathustra " and was delivering lectures on the history of art . By 17 , he had made his professional debut as a actor , with the Gate Theater in Dublin . At 23 , he astonished - and scared - the country with his realistic radio broadcast of " The War of the Worlds . " And at 26 , he created one of the enduring masterworks of American cinema , " Citizen Kane. " // From there , the brilliant trajectory began to reverse itself . One film after another got caught up in arguments with the studios over editing and distribution ; others were left uncompleted largely because of problems of money and ego . The director spent much of his later life struggling to put together financing for his projects , and he would end up as a regular on television , appearing in commercials and on talk shows. // Actor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage - Orson Welles was all these things . He was also , as Frank Brady ' s workmanlike biography suggests , a Falstaffian figure - a world-class raconteur and con artist adept at self-promotion and self-invention . In the end , a magician who believed , as he once put it , that " everything in this world was phony , worked with mirrors . " At his worst , a magician who seemed all theatrics and greasepaint ; at his best , a magician able to create modernist miracles on film - elliptical illusions of light and shadow that made us not only reconsider the technical possibilities of cinema but also rethink the very act of perception. // Given Welles ' s achievements and the histrionic quality of his life , it ' s not surprising that he has been the subject of dozens of books . In comparison with the last two biographies of Welles to appear , Mr. Brady ' s study takes a mild-mannered middle road : it evinces neither the dewy-eyed affection of Barbara Leaming ' s recent book ( which included long interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higham ' s melodramatic volume ( which described Welles as a megalomaniac who suffered from fear of failure ) . Instead , Mr. Brady , who teaches cinema at St. John ' s University , trudges dutifully through the Sturm und Drang of Welles ' s life , according equal weight to his failures and his successes. // There are glimpses of many different Welleses : Welles the precocious student looking for " some bizarre way to disturb people " ; Welles the earnest radio actor studying photographs of real people " to see if the facial expression or bone structure could possibly suggest the probable quality of the voice " ; Welles the theater Wunderkind working around the clock with John Houseman to oversee Mercury Theater productions ; Welles the eager film apprentice screening John Ford ' s " Stagecoach " 40 times to learn cinematic technique ; Welles the peripatetic actor traveling the world to take roles in second-rate movies , and Welles the aging bon vivant holding court at restaurants in Los Angeles. // Unfortunately , these disparate portraits of Welles never come together - as the jigsaw-puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form anything larger . Though there are fascinating tidbits of information about Welles ' s idiosyncrasies ( his fondness for false noses , his insistence on naming his first daughter Christopher because he liked the sound of the name , his violent dislike of the character Harry Lime in " The Third Man " ) , we never get any real sense of this man ' s inner life , the psychological elements that helped shape the arc of his career , the concerns that molded his artistic vision. // As for Welles ' s work , Mr. Brady proves an earnest but somewhat uneven guide . He does a solid job of showing how the director ' s work on stage and his work on screen fed each other : how cinematic techniques turned up in stage productions like " Five Kings " as early as 1939 and how certain cinematic innovations ( like the deep-focus photography in " Citizen Kane " ) reflected the director ' s appreciation of theatrical conventions. // Yet unlike Andre Bazin ' s famous book or James Naremore ' s more recent study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assess Welles ' s directorial achievement . There is no sustained examination of thematic or stylistic preoccupations in his movies as a whole ; and while his directorial work in such films as " The Stranger " and " The Magnificent Ambersons " is skimmed over lightly , considerable space is devoted to analyzing his performances on screen - an odd choice , given the rather hammy quality of so much of his acting. // The two chapters about " Citizen Kane " succinctly rehash much material that will already be familiar to readers of Robert L. Carringer ' s fine study " The Making of Citizen Kane " ( 1985 ) . In addition to examining the contributions of John Houseman , the writer Herman J. Mankiewicz and the cinematographer Gregg Toland , Mr. Brady looks closely at the genesis of the idea for the film. // He notes that Welles wanted his first Hollywood project to be about " real people , men who could be said to be ' larger than life , ' such as Leonardo da Vinci , Niccolo Machiavelli , or Alexandre Dumas " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Aldous Huxley ' s book " After Many a Summer Dies the Swan " ( a novel supposedly based on William Randolph Hearst ' s life ) ; that his ex-wife Virginia ' s membership in Hearst ' s social circle made him particularly aware of the newspaper magnate ' s power . He also quotes Welles to the effect that Hearst was a friend of his father and that he got the idea of telling the story from different points of view from " the Bible , from the appearances of witnesses who come to testify about a man ' s character. " // Sharply rebutting Pauline Kael ' s argument in " The Citizen Kane Book " that Mankiewicz was the principal screenwriter on the film , Mr. Brady argues that " the facts make it clear that Welles was the injured party. " //
