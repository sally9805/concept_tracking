 | Oncee , in the mists of time , Zeus and Hermes came to earth as mortals . Dressed shabbily , they were denied food and rest by everyone except Philemon and Baucis , a humble couple who gave them the hospitality of their cottage . For their kindness , the gods granted the loving pair one wish ? that they be allowed to die in the same instant , so that neither would have to grieve for the other . As a further boon from the gods , Philemon and Baucis were transformed into two trees at their death , an oak and a linden standing branch by bough through the ages . The myth of Philemon and Baucis is one of the warmest stories of marital devotion in all of literature , and one of the few . A realistic modern version might have the conjugal pair coming back , after a life of bickering , as cactus plants . The most notable fact about marriage in the past several decades has been the rising statistics of its demise . By the mid-1970s one out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure is heading for 50 per cent . Yet the almost forgotten corollary of those numbers is that , for better or worse , most marriages do survive . Frequently it is for worse : many marriages last from sheer inertia , for lack of any other option or " for the sake of the children " ? and settle into a stoic , joyless longevity . Some partners remain bound in awful wedlock by a kind of symbiosis in which mutual dependency may go hand in hand with mutual loathing , like the pathological union in Edward Albee 's " Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " But often enough , marriages ripen into deeper understanding and affection as the couples themselves mature and learn to negotiate their differences . " It 's a process , not a product , " says Barbara DeFrank-Lynch , a professor of family counseling at Southern Connecticut State College . " People have to be willing to work through the fights and crises , without which a marriage can not grow . " Phenomenon ' : Considering its low repute in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people than ever are marrying : an estimated 92 per cent of Americans will try it at least once in their lives . More are also remarrying after divorce , and hoping to make a go of it the second or third time around . " Long marriage is a larger phenomenon than we think , " says Harvard sociologist Mary Jo Bane , who coauthored ( with George Masnick ) " The Nation 's Families : 1960-1990 , " a study of marriage and family trends . The latest statistics seem to bear her out . They show that 58 per cent of all first marriages last more than fifteen years , 52 per cent more than twenty years , 47 per cent more than 25 years ? and a charmed 16 per cent make it past the golden-wedding anniversary . To judge by the increased patient load at counseling and therapy clinics , couples are also working harder at hanging on . One Boston couple who have " bumbled together " through 29 years of up-and-down marriage undertook transactional analysis three years ago to sort out some of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hush-hush business about counseling has gone out the window , " says the wife , who believes that therapy is helping . " People are more enlightened about their needs . " Professionals themselves are taking a closer look at the dynamics of the marital relationship . A new field of clinical research on " couple development " has sprung up in the past five years or so , and several published studies have explored developmental " stages " in marriage . Such studies generally agree in finding four basic stages . In the first , spouses are typically self-centered , looking only at how the relationship can serve them . At the next level they negotiate quid pro quos ? a service for a service , a concession for a concession . During the third stage they begin to appreciate each other 's individuality and make accommodations for the good of the marriage and each other . By the fourth stage they have evolved a set of " rules of the relationship " by which they can avoid or deal with problems . " Unfortunately , many marriages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Boston University professor and family therapist . " The husband and wife never get beyond saying , I 'll wash your back if you wash mine ' . " Stuck marriages often break up ? or worse , do n't . Many go on to become what Dr. William B. Phillips , an Atlanta family counselor , calls " The American Gold Watch Marriage " ? short on excitement and fulfillment but long on security . Others become " Gruesome Twosomes , " described by psychiatrist Don D. Jackson and author William Lederer in their 1968 book , " Mirages of Marriage , " as partners who present the aspect of a loving , devoted couSnyder ple while never acknowledging their deep disappointment in each other . But with some " lifers , " the unhappiness is manifest . One study of couples married 45 years or longer found that 60 per cent were so wretched in their constancy that they could be judged clinically disturbed . Says California State University psychologist Judy Todd , who conducted the four-year study with associate Ariela Friedman : " They reported such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betrayed : Older couples uttered their vows of fidelity when marital values were more traditional and sex roles more restrictive . Husbands spoke patronizingly of " my better half " while arguably enjoying the better deal . But both partners , notes Barbara DeFrank-Lynch , may have been betrayed by cultural myths that showed marriage as sublimation , a surrendering of part of oneself for the wholeness of union . " I think they paid a tremendous price , " she says . Often they became locked into destructively complementary patterns , what DeFrank-Lynch calls " the bitch and the nice guy , mother and son , daddy and doll , master and slave . " Experts believe that the best marriages are mutually supportive and leave room for both individuals to grow . Given that , plus open lines of communication for resolving conflicts @#  | and a strong sense of commitment to weather the storms , marriage has a fair chance of not only enduring but prospering . " If you stick it out long enough , you get more mature , " says Francine Klagsbrun , a Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were a lot more immature in our early fights , and perhaps if we had lived in different times , it would 've been easy for us to split up then . " They almost did . Sam Klagsbrun had been working toward a doctorate in clinical psychology when he met Fran , but at about the time they were married he decided to become a psychiatrist . That meant an eightyear siege of training and study that put huge strains on the marriage . At the end , Sam seemed to want total freedom . " He thought he was n't in love with me and wanted to leave , " Fran recalls . When Sam went off on a week 's vacation alone , she first debated with herself , then wrote a letter saying how she felt about him . Sam , walking a beach in Florida , debated too . " I thought about what really matters , about my feelings for Fran and my basic sense of an integrated life , " he says , " and after a while I recognized that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive servitude . " At any such point of crisis , Sam has since concluded , a couple remakes the original decision to marry . " The fantasy of making a commitment once and forever is nonsense , " he says . " As we change , we have to renegotiate periodically . " The Klagsbruns renegotiate in the occasional battles that still flare up between them ? often a useful and necessary way of communicating in marriage . Says Sam : " We end up blurting things out that we 've stored up and saying : Stop . Look what 's happening . Here 's what I need . ' It 's a matter of adapting to our separate changes @#  | over the years , kind of catching up with the fact that things have changed . We 're not actually married to the same people we were married to years ago . " Not the least virtue of lasting marriages is that they make both partners a little less selfish . Best-selling author Irving Wallace and his novelist wife , Sylvia , ran into their first problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that his wife give up her journalism career to play mother . Sylvia , who had been working since she was 12 , complied ? and " had a nervous breakdown , " she says . Irving refused to yield on the issue , but finally the Wallaces began seeing an analyst who specialized in parental problems . " I worked it out , " says Irving . " You see how you 're trapped in traditional ways , and I learned more about my role in raising children . " Ultimately , it was Sylvia who supported him through the lean years and made it possible for him to write his first blockbuster book , " The Chapman Report . " Married 40 years now , the Wallaces almost ritually air their problems each night . " I found out everything went smoother if I did n't keep anything to myself , " Irving explains . It is , they say , a totally shared marriage . They attend parties , take walks , travel and plan together , and both have offices next to their Beverly Hills home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Intimacy : Many couples prefer to keep something of themselves in reserve for their own interests and private thoughts , but that does n't preclude intimacy . Atlantans Marvin and Temi Silver , married 26 years , have separate friends and hobbies , but sometimes what Temi enjoys best is being silently alone together . " I just love that quiet time , " she says . " I do n't care if he 's reading the paper or watching television . It 's a feeling that 's built with time , layer upon layer of shared experience . " Or , as Sam Klagsbrun puts it : " It comes from having been through the war together . " In truth , relatively few couples attain that state of quiet intimacy . In her research on long-term marriages , Judy Todd found that " intimacy and power " were the two factors in predicting marital success or failure . The majority of couples she interviewed had shared few of their feelings and avoided the confrontations by which most spouses settle their contest for power . Experts view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the leadership role in the marriage and who has the greater status . In the modern ideal , couples move beyond that struggle to a system of shared power . " The fellow travelers ? that 's the rainbow , " says DeFrank-Lynch . Songwriter Paul Parnes and his wife , Sylvia , a nurse , battled out one crucial issue in the kitchen . Both were working but Sylvia was doing most of the chores . " I just said to him one day , There 's no place on my birth certificate that says I always have to do the dishes . ' That does n't mean he did n't help me before , but he was always doing me the favor . " Married 30 years now , Paul has learned to clean ? and cook ? quite efficiently . In their own study of how couples resolve conflict , Dr. David H. Olson of the University of Minnesota and Robert Ryder of the University of Connecticut discovered that although 80 per cent of the couples interviewed said that they shared leadership in their marriages , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The longer the couple is together , the more rigid the style becomes . That is what 's hard for therapists . " Even couples who grow and change for the better may have to work at renewing their marriages periodically , if only to beat back the boredom that invariably sets in . David and Alice McGhee of Dubuque , Iowa , who will celebrate their nineteenth anniversary in August , still manage to set aside time for romantic interludes when their children are away . " We really do enjoy one another 's company , " David says , " and we are n't beyond opening a bottle of champagne and sitting around the fireplace together . " But with growing children and , frequently , both spouses working , marriages can 76 become workaday affairs . Donna and Gerald Selby admit that after seventeen years the romance has cooled . Their day-to-day concerns tend to revolve around their jobs , their Atlanta home , their 16-year-old son ? rarely each other . " We do n't do enough dumb things together , " says Gerald . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day off and enjoy . " Ironically , it is Gerald 's frequent travels as marketing manager for a computer company that stimulate the marriage . That gives the Selbys needed time away from each other and fresh enthusiasm when they reunite . " I do n't sleep well when he 's out of town , " says Donna , " and I 'm glad when he comes home . I may not get those butterflies like I did when I was 16 , but it 's a feeling of comfort , of sureness . And I know I 'll have someone to put my feet against at night . " Best Friends : Comfort and companionship may be the ultimate reward of marriages that thrive . Successful couples are often each other 's best friends , if no longer infatuated lovers . It is probably advisable , in any case , not to enter wedlock with expectations of unquenchable romance . In life , as in literature , such bliss may be mythological . Francine Klagsbrun speculates that her own marriage will convey that message , in a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seen us fight and make up , " says Francine , who is writing a book about lasting marriage . " She 's seen the tensions and the anger , and she 's seen us live with that . I would point out that there are rewards beyond that and that it 's more rewarding to work through things that may be difficult if you really care about someone . The given in marriage is that it 's more important to stick it out ? to see the end of the story , as it were . " @#
