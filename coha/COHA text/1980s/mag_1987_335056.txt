It started as a mistake , by all signs an honest one , but it grew into a Wall Street disaster . A 36-year-old senior bond trader at Merrill Lynch apparently lost his cool last month when rising interest rates started rapidly eroding the value of his $900 million portfolio . Instead of liquidating the securities and taking the loss , as most of his colleagues on Wall Street were doing , the Merrill Lynch trader seemingly gambled on a go-for-broke strategy . Without his employer 's permission , he plunged in deeper , buying up $800 million more of the securities in the hope that an interest-rate turnaround would bring enough profits to bail out all his losses . His wager failed spectacularly . When Merrill Lynch announced the episode last week , the firm estimated its losses at $250 million , possibly the largest single trading deficit in Wall Street history . <P> The financial community was stunned at not only the immensity of the loss but also the identity of the trader : Howard Rubin , the head of Merrill Lynch 's trading desk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not charged with any criminal wrongdoing , was a respected trader and is a Harvard Business School graduate . Said Stephen Joseph , a senior trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert : " It 's really strange . He has a great reputation . " <P> But Rubin was apparently dealing in one of the tricky , relatively untested new types of securities . The bonds that tripped up Merrill Lynch are **28;9050;TOOLONG securities , known as IOPOs . Investment houses create them by buying mortgage-backed bonds  --  typically those issued by the Government National Mortgage Association , or Ginnie Mae  --  and then splitting the securities into two parts , one that pays interest and another whose price rises or falls with the resale value of the bond . Rubin was selling the interest-paying bonds and hanging on to the principal securities , which lost value rapidly as interest rates rose . <P> The incident prompted questions about Merrill Lynch 's internal supervision . The firm claimed it had put a closer watch on Rubin at least a year earlier , after assessing him as talented but riskprone . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader , who had allegedly failed to disclose investments and lost $10 million . Meanwhile , colleagues began looking for hints in Rubin 's background about why he took such a plunge . According to one account , the trader had been a devoted blackjack player before his business-school days .
