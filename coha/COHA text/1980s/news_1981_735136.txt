txt Not so long ago , some directors of Bering Straits Native Corp . were caustically suggesting a name change to " dire straits . " The firm had frittered away its $44 million capital and gone $39 million into debt , and it faced 150 lawsuits from creditors . Bering Straits still has serious problems . But it survives . And that seems typical of the 13 unusual corporations set up by Congress in the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Act to compensate some 78,000 Eskimos , Indians and Aleuts . It was considered the most generous settlement with native Americans in U.S. history . The native corporatiOns got 44 million acres rich in natural resources and about $1 billion tax-free paid in installments . This year , the federal government completed the last cash payment . Hereafter , the native corporations will carry on or founder on the basis of their own business acumen . The informed betting is that they will stay in operation , sustained chiefly by the mineral riches on their land . No Bankruptcy Candidate At Bering Straits , for instance , chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slapped with an involuntary bankruptcy action on his first day on the job , in 1978 . The firm 's debt still is huge , and it has no substantive operations . However , it has settled all but one creditor suit , is selling real estate to raise cash , and is lining up exploration contracts on some 2.2 million potentially mineral-rich acres it owns on Seward Peninsula . " You could n't bankrupt Bering Straits if you beat it with a stick , because they have so much land with valuable mineral resources , " says a native leader . The 1971 act ( which cleared the way for the Alaska oil pipeline right of way ) set up 12 regional corporations within Alaska and an additional firm , Seattle-based 13th Regional Corp. , for natives living outside Alaska . The act also established smaller corporations in the 200 or so rural villages where most Alaska natives carve out a subsistence livelihood . Culture Clash Imposing the corporate structures on the natives understandably created problems . Most shareholders were more familiar with gill-netting fish and trapping animals than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors selected to run the companies were equally unsophisticated . " With the act , you were asking a culture  --  a whole people  --  to move away from a subsistence life style of several thousand years and in 20 years move in , take over and successfully manage ** regional corporations , " says Douglas , a director of Ahtna Regional Corp . " That 's something the nonnative has had 2,000 years to learn . " Several native corporations , eager to make an immediate mark , started high-risk ventures only to find that they lacked the management savvy to keep them afloat . Others fell victim to outsiders peddling dubious investment schemes . " When you have that kind of money , everybody approaches you with their ideas and you end up buying a lot of lemons , " says George Kriste , executive vice president at Cook Inlet Region Inc. , the corporation representing natives in the Anchorage area . Calista Corp . lost millions when it built a resort near Willow , once expected to be the state 's new capital only to have voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirted with disaster by investing heavily in fishing when that industry was going into a slump . Bering Straits ' troubles followed an acquisition spree that began in late 1974 . " When you think that 10 years ago none of us were able to balance a checkbook , let alone understand the mechanics of a corporate institution , I think we 've done remarkably well , " says the chairman of a native corporation . " They got caught up in the euphoria of the pipeline . " says Mr. Davis . The company got into a dozen or so fields including construction , trucking , banking and mobile-home sales . By the end of 1980 , nearly all the Bering Straits subsidiaries were broke . " They paid too much and the debts they incurred were disastrous , " Mr. Davis comments . Making matters worse , Bering Straits agreed to guarantee the investments of various business partners , leading to the tangle of litigation with creditors . After fending off the lawsuits , Bering Straits went on a legal offensive last year , charging its bank , Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with malfeasance . Bank officials were charged with using Bering Straits money in " speculative and financially unsound " oustness ventures . The charges have been denied by the bank 's officers , including Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski , who was bank president at the time of the investments . The Big League Other slow-starting native corporations also are rebounding , with the help of professional managers who are formulating longrange plans based primarily oil the exploitation of natural resources . At least one has made it into the big leagues : Juneau-based Sealaska Corp . ranked as No. 951 this year on the Fortune magazine list of the 1,000 largest U.S. industrial firms . It earned $5.9 million last year , mostly from timber sales and the operations of Ocean Beauty Seafood Inc. , a processing firm bought in 1970 . Sealaska also owns a share of several promising oil and gas leases in the Beaufort Sea , and it recently entered into a joint venture to build oil-drilling rigs with two other regional firms . " When you think that 10 years ago none of us were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporate institution , I think we 've done remarkably well . " says Byron Mallott , the company 's 38-year-old chairman . Another growing firm is Cook Inlet Region , which earned $5.7 million last year and is projecting $13 million in profits for 1981 . It has interests in offshore oil leases , and it has formed a limited partnership with Parker Drilling Co . Some native corporations operate unconventionally . Nana Regional Corp . operates a number of money-losing businesses , including a hotel , a jade factory and a construction firm , around its home area of Kotzebue , because they promote jobs for the locality . To compensate for the losses . Nana aggressively pursues profitable ventures in such fields as oil-rig production elsewhere in Alaska . The Best Approach " Most corporations like to make a profit before they make contributions to their community , " says John Schaeffer , Nana president . " In our case , we took the opposite view and said it was more important than profits. - We felt it was the best approach and so far it has worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been able yet to contribute much to their shareholders . " For the average shareholder , the promise of the act is still to be realized , " says Sealaska 's Mr. Mallott . " Our dividends are still small , and our ability to generate employment for shareholders is limited . All we can tell them is that things will be better in the future . " For many natives , though , the wait may be over in 1991 . That is when a 20-year prohibition on sales of native corporation stock is lifted . Big companies then may start viewing the resource-rich Alaska firms as takeover targets . And that could mean big paydays for natives willing to part with their shares in regional and village corporations . Several native leaders , concerned that stock sales might strip natives of their land , already are mounting a campaign to persuade shareholders to retain their stock . " Our whole native heritage is based on use of the land ; if we lose our land , we lose our culture , " says Nana 's Mr. Schaeffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell . " The decision will be tough and totally individual , " says Larry Dineen , executive vice president of Arctic Slope Regional Corp. , a firm whose region includes some of Alaska 's most promising oil lands . " We 're not talking about just dangling a few hundred bucks in front of somebody . It 's calculated that each stockholder in Arctic Slope is sitting on stock that will be worth $50,000 . And , frankly , I think that 's conservative . "
