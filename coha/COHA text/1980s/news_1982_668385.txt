The itinerary for Anne Audain included stopovers in Brisbane , Sydney , Auckland , Nandi , Honolulu , Los Angeles and Denver . And , by Friday , when she arrived in Boston , she ' d just about been around the world in five days . From the Commonwealth Games to the Bonne Bell . Completing her odyssey , that included a victory in the Commonwealth Games 3000 in Brisbane , Audain said " Goodbye " to the lead group in the 6th Bonne Bell 10-kilometer road race today and ran to a course-record 31:42 , second fastest on the world road list . " My plan was to stay with the leaders to see what the pace was , " said Audain . " I had a pace in mind . If someone was with me , I ' d have to contend with it . I wanted to win . I felt the jet lag . I was coming off a little excitement at home ( Auckland ) and I had a 45- hour trip . " Sweden ' s Midde Hamrin , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 32:21 . Francie Larrieu-Smith , who has moved up from the 1500/mile league to the longer road/track distances , was third ( 33:06 ) and Canadian Nancy Rooks ( 33:19 ) and Boston College women ' s cross-country coach Judi St. Hillaire ( 33:20 ) completed the top five . Audain , who won the Freedom Trail eight-miler in her only previous Boston race last October , went out with the lead pack as the field of 7700 started out from Charles Street between the Public Garden and The Common and stayed with a group of five through the first mile . Just after they went over the Longfellow Bridge into Cambridge and turned Westbound on Memorial Drive , Audain made her move about one mile and a quarter into the race . They went through the first mile in 5:05 and Audain was alone through two miles in 10:02 . " I expected her to run extremely well , " said Larrieu-Smith . " She ran wire- to-wire in Brisbane . She was definitely the one to beat . I was not going to let anyone get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she made that surge , that it was over . Annie ' s just in awesome shape . " Audain , 27 , has been on an awesome tear the past two years . She was last beaten in a race at any distance - on the roads or the track - by countrywoman Allison Roe in Atlanta ' s Peachtree 10- kilometer on July 4 , 1981 . She won the Commonwealth Games 3000 in 8:45.53 . She broke Jan Merrill ' s course-record ( 32:24 ) set last year and her time was second to the world-record 30:59 set by Sweden ' s Grete Waits in the 1980 L ' Eggs race in New York ' s Central Park . Audain ' s personal best had been a 31:45 in Clevaland ' s Revco race in May . " The 3000 was a good race to come off of , " said husband Steve . " We thought a 31:00 was possible here , but , with all the turns on the course , it wasn ' t possible . She felt she was only 80 percent but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d come here and turn on . " The Audains live eight months of the year in the Boulder , Colo. , suburb of Littleton and the other four months on the island of Waiheke in Auckland . " We ' re the only runners on the island , " said Steve , " and we can go for 20- mile runs and not see a soul . It ' s good for Annie . She gets away from all this hype . It ' s a very simple lifestyle . . . and that ' s Annie . " This was the largest women ' s athletic event in the world , with the 7700 entrants experiencing a delightful race on a crisp , breezy and sunny afternoon . As Audain turned and headed Eastbound on Memorial Drive , she passed many of the runners in her wake . They applauded and shouted to her , an appropriate tribute to the world ' s best . From Brisbane to Boston .                   @ @
