When she turned 21 last month , she already had claims to fame as a model , fashion designer and royal . So what next on the wish list for the world 's most thoroughly modern celebrity princess ? Well , gosh , why not try to cut a record ? Sounds like a giggle , but no joke , Monaco 's Princess Stephanie now has a modest hit record in Europe . Stephanie reports that her latest career turn " came about completely by accident " when a friend at a recording studio casually suggested that she try a voice test . It went so well that she agreed to make a single with one side in English called Irresistible and the other in French called Ouragan ( that means Hurricane , but it is actually the same song ) . The record , which will soon be released in the U.S. , has been out for five weeks and has sold 100,000 copies in France alone . Her lark as a thrush might lead next to making an album , says Stephanie , if that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why the need to keep so busy ? " I 'm growing old , " she laughs . " At my age , one likes to be on the move . " And move to whatever one likes .
