With his hunched , narrow shoulders , his chin tucked resolutely into his chest , and his slinky , slouched walk , Bernhard Hugo Goetz looks rather like a human question mark . The inner man bears the same punctuation : Victim or victimizer ? Hero or malefactor ? Loner or leader ? He is gentle , but demonstrably violent . Personable , but introverted . Idealistic , but cynical . He desires privacy , but has courted publicity . He is humble , but strangely messianic . He lives in New York City , but claims to loathe it . He is not indicted for attempted murder ; he is indicted for attempted murder . In his public statements and interviews he has often said what he is not  --  " I am not a hero " ; " I am not a public figure "  --  but never what he is . <P> The original , eerily accurate police drawing of Goetz showed the face of the " before " figure in comic-book ads for body-building devices , the pale visage of the scrawny , bespectacled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face by a burly bully . When the news first flashed that a wispy-haired man in a windbreaker had shot four teenagers who threatened him on the subway , that 98-lb. weakling became overnight a quixotic urban American hero . Because nothing much was known about him , the 37-year-old electrical engineer became a tabula rasa on which Americans etched their uneasiness and projected their fantasies of retaliation . Goetz was also a media-made man , composed of scraps of headlines and bits of film topped off with a pundit 's knowing gloss . He seemed to symbolize the spirited underdog , the man who bellows out of his apartment window , " I 'm mad as hell and I 'm not going to take it anymore ! " <P> But it was not so simple . Bernhard Goetz was far more complex than the mythic black and white of banner headlines . As details of his life became known , he took shape as a frightened , brooding , obsessive man somehow transformed , as he put it , into a " monster . " <P> The youngest of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dairy country of upstate New York . His father , a German immigrant to the U.S. , ran his own bookbinding business and a 300-acre dairy farm . When Bernhard was twelve , his father was accused and convicted on charges of molesting two 15- year-old boys . The elder Goetz appealed the verdict and later pleaded guilty on a reduced charge of disorderly conduct . To cushion Bernhard and his sister Bernice from the trauma , he sent them to a boarding school in a cathedral town in Switzerland , where Goetz spent his high school years . <P> By the time he entered New York University in 1965 , the family had moved to Orlando , Fla. , where his father further prospered developing medium-priced tract housing . It was to the family 's spacious home overlooking a lake that Goetz returned after graduating from N.Y.U. with a B.S. degree in electrical and nuclear engineering . In order to avoid military duty in Viet Nam , he feigned mental illness . Goetz joined his father 's development company and entered into a brief , unhappy marriage .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
