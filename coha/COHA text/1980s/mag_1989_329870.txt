Once a month this fall , natural disasters have devastated widely scattered parts of the U.S. In September Hurricane Hugo slammed into the Carolina coast ; October brought the San Francisco Bay earthquake . Last week the furies returned in a burst of tornadoes . Frigid air howled out of the Arctic to collide with record balmy weather pushing northward from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico . The unseasonable clash generated a hopscotching barrage of twisters through 14 states from Arkansas to New York that killed at least 30 people . Though the storms were briefer than Hugo , the whirling winds were stronger than the hurricane 's ( up to 250 m.p.h. ) , and the U.S. death toll was higher . <P> The most poignant single tragedy befell the small ( pop . about 1,200 ) community of East Coldenham , N.Y. , 40 miles northwest of New York City . More than 120 children were eating lunch in the two-story cafeteria of an elementary school when a blast of wind estimated at 100 m.p.h. struck the yellow-brick-and-glass building . A massive section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered glass , concrete and falling bricks . Some pupils who had been standing to watch the storm were tossed about like rag dolls . " I heard a whistling sound , " said Mike Miller , 7 . " Tables were flying . Bricks were flying . There was breaking glass . People were crying . " <P> Teachers ran into the cafeteria rubble , clawing at debris to reach fallen children . Fire fighters sobbed as they freed trapped children , many of whom they knew . When the frantic rescue ended , seven youngsters were dead and 18 hospitalized , three with critical injuries . <P> The death toll was even higher in Huntsville , Ala . There too a school was struck by a tornado . Yet , although it was leveled , the timing  --  about 4:30 p.m.  --  was fortunate , since most of the children had left . But the twister that roared through the city killed 18 , ranging in age from 2 to 67 , and demolished 119 houses . " It just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeweler Robert Husman , buried under debris in his demolished store , squirmed to the surface . " I came up looking at the taillights of a Toyota station wagon , " he recalled . The wind had swept the car atop the fallen roof of the building . <P> The city 's Westbury Mall was reduced to a heap of wreckage up to 14 ft. deep . The adjacent Waterford Square apartment complex was flattened . Most of the fatalities occurred at those two sites , as shoppers and residents had no time to flee the storm 's assault . Terri-Lynn Frasher , 16 , had been taking a shower in her apartment ; she was pinned under a sink and vanity when her walls collapsed . Gashed by a broken mirror , she was pulled naked from the building . " I ca n't even say I lost everything but the clothes on my back , " she said wryly from her hospital bed . Isolated motorists died as their cars were lifted and hurled off roads . <P> In almost mocking contrast to the weather 's carnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun shone on San Francisco and Oakland as 11,000 people strolled onto the Bay Bridge in an advance celebration of its weekend reopening . The 50-ft. section of the upper deck that collapsed during the quake had been repaired well ahead of schedule in a round-the-clock $2.5 million construction feat . California Governor George Deukmejian cheerily declared , " We 're back , and we 're in business again . "
