txt AFTER SNUBBING mortgages where the interest rate adjusts periodically to prevailing rates , home buyers finally are succumbing to the savings these mortgages offer . Often , adjustable-rate mortgages , or ARMs as they 're called , are making the difference in whether a buyer can afford a loan . most recent figures snow that ARMS account for nail of all conventional mortgages being made . That 's a far cry from a couple of years ago when buyers shied from them in favor of fixed-rate mortgages . Consumers were so leery of ARMs and the risk that interest rates , and hence their house payments , would shoot up overnight that jokes evolved about them . ( One story tells of a lender offering an " ARM and LEG " loan . LEG stands for " lenders ' equity growing . " ) Recently , home buyers have come to appreciate the savings that ARMs offer . According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , ARMs made up 25% of single-family conventional loans in July , 33% in August , 45% in September and 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricing . Emigrant Savings Bank in New York has advertised an ARM that carries a 9.4% rate for the first year ( plus an origination fee of 3.5 points , or 3.5% of the loan amount ) . Dime Savings Bank in New York is offering a 9.36% , one-year ARM , plus four points . MOST LENDERS are n't discounting the first year of their ARMs so steeply . Just the same , the price advantage is significant . For instance , on a $60,000 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 13.5%. the monthly principal and interest payment comes to about $687 . But a $60,000 ARM that carries an 11.5% rate the first year has a monthly payment of $594 , a difference of $93 . For a mortgage of this size , lenders would expect a family to have an annual income of at least $43,000 to qualify for the 13.5% loan . However , a family with a $38,700 income could afford the same house with an adjustable-rate , 11.5% mortgage . Another factor is playing a role in the rise of ARMs : Interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring , have lost much of the volatility that unnerved so many people . So the rates on ARMs should n't leap sharply . What 's more , many lenders limit the amount the rate can be increased at any one time . One lender that has made extensive use of ARMs is City Federal Savings &; Loan Association of Piscataway , N.J. In October , City Federal closed $210 million in conventional loans in 17 states , 75 ' 2 of which were ARMs . James , senior vice president for mortgages , says , " It 's our premier product . " Jefferson Savings &; Loan Association in Brentwood , Mo. , only offers ARMs . Lloyd Doerflinger Jr. , a vice president , says , " People are interested in a lower rate even though it 's for a shorter period of time . " Jefferson recently priced its one-year ARMs at 10.75% , plus two points , well below a competitor 's 13.25% for a fixed-rate loan . Still , some resistance lingers . William Long , president of Talman Home Mortgage Corp . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still grudging resistance to ARMs . Our experience has been disappointing . " Lenders Fear Massachusetts Waste Law Massachusetts ' new hazardous-waste law is having a toxic effect on the Bay State 's real estate market . The 1983 law has a provision for a " priority super lien " to enable the state to come up with the money for cleaning up a waste site if necessary . That means the state has first claim on the value of any property held by a waste-site owner . The claim takes precedence over any mortgage and applies to everything from beach houses to factories . The super lien and the extra risk it creates have mortgage lenders scared . For example , Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , or Freddie Mac as it 's known , is refusing to purchase mortgages on multifamily projects in Massachusetts and has indicated that , unless the law is changed , it will stop buying mortgages on single-family residences as of Dec 15 . So far , Freddie Mac 's actions are believed to have stalled construction on about a dozen multifamily projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , says there are serious constitutional questions about the super lien . But meantime , he says , " This can hold up the sale of properties and put a cloud over billions of dollars in loans . " Freddie Mac and other agents act as intermediaries between local lenders and the capital markets and serve to funnel mortgage funds into an area , often at a lower cost than would otherwise be possible . And the prospect of higher mortgage rates on homes worries politicians to the point where they 're willing to change the law . Under one proposed solution , the state 's lien would n't take precedence over a mortgage loan on a residential property . A similar exclusion for other kinds of property is n't likely soon because of stiff opposition from environmentalists . And though insurance companies , pension funds and commercial banks are likely to think twice about Massachusetts loans until the law is revised , problems It has posed so far for office buildings , shopping centers and factories have n't had enough political impact . Nevertheless , warns Sen. Jack Brennan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until we do resolve this , future economic development of the commonwealth has a serious problem . "
