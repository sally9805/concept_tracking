Recently , my wife and I took a one-week cruise on the Holland America Line ' s SS Volendam . It was our first trip to Bermuda , but it took only this one visit to understand why so many return time and time again . All in all , we spent about 3 1/2 days at sea and about the same amount of time in Bermuda . Thus we were able to enjoy shipboard life yet had ample time in port to explore the island. // On many other resort islands , once you leave the grounds of the tourist hotels and venture into town , you ' re apt to find things a bit rundown . Not so in BermudA . Hamilton is a sparkling clean , prosperous looking city of attractive , pastel-colored buildings and homes . You ' ll find that same just-washed look in St. George , Somerset , and the other towns on the island. // If you ' re a beach person , you ' ll be in your glory here . There are miles of lovely beaches , with sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Getting from your floating hotel to the beaches , or anywhere else in Bermuda , is easy . We found no need to join any of the shore excursions available to the ship ' s passengers at extra cost . You can get around the island by cab , bus , moped , or bicycle . Rental cars are not available . Mopeds seem to be the favorite form of transportation . They can be rented for about $7 a day , even less if you take one for three days . However , unless you ' re familiar with these motorized bikes , it ' s best to consider some other means of moving about . The roads sometimes seem alive with them. // We chose the buses , and it proved to be an excellent choice . They ' re frequent , inexpensive , and leave for just about every place from a main terminal just a short walk from the ships at Front Street . Invariably , the drivers were pleasant and helpful . One-way fares range from 55 cents to a maximum of 85 cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s OK . US and Canadian money is accepted , but exact change is expected. // We arrived in Bermuda on a Tuesday morning at 7 , having left New York the Sunday before at 4 p. m . Since the Volendam is the only New York-to-Bermuda cruise ship with a Sunday departure , it has a reputation of being a great favorite with honeymooners . My wife and I , a long way from newlyweds , had some misgivings . But we found there were only 84 honeymoon couples among nearly 700 passengers , so we did not feel as though we were attending a long wedding reception. // On the first day in port we wandered around Hamilton doing a bit of window shopping . We returned to the ship for lunch and a swim in the pool . Later , relaxed , refreshed , and well fed , we set out again on a leisurely , unplanned walking tour of the town . Strolling along Front Street , we admired the ships from a dockside park ; visited the Anglican cathedral ; took photographs of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shops . By now it was time to start getting ready for dinner , always a festive occasion on board . Time to dress up , to enjoy elegant surroundings , attentive service , and most of all the parade of good things that emerges from the kitchen. // After dinner those passengers in search of night life have an extra option . They can go ashore to sample the local variety , found for the most part in the hotels , or stay aboard for the show , dancing , movies , or other activities which continue while the liner is in port. // Our second day in Bermuda began with an early breakfast , then we set out by bus with another couple to visit the beach many consider the island ' s loveliest . All too often highly touted places turn out to be a disappointment . This was not the case with Horseshoe Bay , a curving expanse of the type of beach you usually encounter only in travel folders . Sand that is clean , soft , kind to the feet , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the right temperature . We explored and discovered several small coves , miniature beaches hidden from sight by huge boulders at both ends of the main beach . We selected a stretch of sand shaded by tall pine trees and spent a thoroughly delightful day . It was a slightly sunburned group that assembled that evening for dinner. // On Wednesday of each month , from April until July , the Bermuda Regiment and Pipe Band stage something called the Beating of Retreat , a tradition that was started by the British a couple of hundred years ago . It takes place on Front Street at 9 p. m . Joining the crowd of enthusiastic onlookers ,  --  tourists and natives alike  --  we were captivated by the sight of high stepping members of the regiment , smartly dressed in bright red and gold uniforms , performing a series of intricate marching maneuvers . We returned to our ship , ready to dig into the midnight buffet , since we had only had five meals that day. // I found Bermuda to be one of the world ' s most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island as pink beaches , pastel houses , and bougainvillea . People seem to go out of their way to be nice . An example : I saw a shirt I liked in a shop window . When I entered the store and asked the saleslady about it , they did not have that shirt in my size . Now this was hardly a major purchase ; as I recall it was about $15 . Yet , she phoned two other shops , one of which had the right color in the proper size . She volunteered to pick it up on her way to work the following morning . I could stop by and get it later , which I did. // Friday afternoon at three found us lining the deck as we prepared to get under way . There was no other large ship to bid us farewell . But , before the tugs took leave of us , they gave the customary salute . We answered and began to move out of the harbor . While passing the Hamilton Princess Hotel , a bugler appeared on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spine tingling sound of our foghorn . Then the hotel lowered both the British and American flags to half- mast . They really know how to say goodbye . The only jarring note came from several members of the ship ' s orchestra who were on deck playing " Hello Dolly . " " Auld Lang Syne " or " Auf Wiedersehen " might have been more appropriate . On the other hand , whatever feelings of sadness we experienced were soon dispelled by the realization that although our stay in Bermuda was over  --  our trip wasn ' t . We still had more than a day and a half to look forward to before arriving back in New York. // //
