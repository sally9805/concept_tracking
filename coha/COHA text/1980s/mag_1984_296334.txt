ORGANIZED CRIMES by Nicholas von Hoffman Harper &; Row ; 274pages ; $14.95 <P> Nearly every journalist believes he has a novel in him . But if he manages to produce the work , it often bears a disquieting resemblance to journalism . Nicholas von Hoffman 's first novel , Organized Crimes , is a happy exception . This is no self-absorbed memoir of How I Broke the Big Story or of backstairs city-room intrigues ; indeed , its only journalist of consequence is in the pay of mobsters and is introduced to the narrative at the moment he is shot dead . <P> The book 's setting is Chicago in the 1930s , an era of celebrity gangsters , ruined financiers , penniless immigrants , left-leaning intellectuals and psychotic anarchists , all of them interconnected in Von Hoffman 's ruefully comic invention . The period is as rich and varied as the turn-of-the-century New York City of E.L . Doctorow 's Ragtime , and the range of real-life characters is even greater : Hoodlums Al Capone and Frank Nitti and Machine Gun Jack McGurn , Mayors Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundelein , Utilities Tycoon Samuel Insull and Assassin Giuseppe Zangara , who struck down Cermak in Miami while trying to kill Franklin D. Roosevelt . <P> Thrust among them is a fictional couple , both , fittingly enough , students of social anthropology . Allan Archibald , a moneyed North Shore Wasp , witnesses the murder of the reporter and on a bet undertakes to write a scholarly paper about the Chicago underworld . Irena Giron , a brilliant but unworldly girl from the Polish ghetto " back of the yards , " catastrophically encourages Allan to learn more about the style and ferocity of the syndicate . Organized Crimes is part political satire , part informal history , part rumination on the Depression , part love story between the rich boy poor in spirit and the poor girl rich in perception . Von Hoffman 's elemental themes are deftly woven into the episodic narrative : among men of power , there may be differences of method but not of motive ; between brains and privilege , choose brains , because money and position may prove fleeting , while intelligence endures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now defunct Chicago Daily News and for the Washington Post , writes with occasional Second City vulgarity and feistiness . But he can also display an elegiac grace about a world in which everything , everywhere , has suddenly gone wrong : " Heading along the street to where he had parked his car , he looked up and saw a dark red , liver-colored sky , full of ores and oxides and particulates . The droughts of last summer had been followed by the winds of November . Although Allan did not know it , he was seeing the State of Oklahoma blowing past Chicago , traveling east . The Dust Bowl had begun . " <P> Von Hoffman 's large cast and its machinations remain credible and , even in the comic passages , are never overdrawn . But the author is more than an adroit tale spinner ; it is character , not accident or circumstance , that brings his central figures to grief . In the process , he merges Chicago myth , legend and history with poignant private truth . This journalist , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <P> - By William A. Henry III
