" We know it is disruptive , but to get your whole constitutional structure and land areas properly constructed , it is necessary to move people. " // The speaker is J. L. Serfontein , an official of the South African government ' s Department of Cooperation and Development . He is one of the foot soldiers of apartheid , the white government ' s officials masterminding the separation of the races in this southern African country. // These officials are engaged in a radical redrawing of the South African map in an effort to carve 10 separate , ethnically based ministates out of the white-ruled republic . On this day , three of the officials are gathered in a government office building here in Pretoria to explain why and how they go about the process. // There is little in the appearance of the three men , all of them Afrikaners , to distinguish them from the thousands of bureaucrats who populate this tree-shaded capital city . One has the look of a portly , white-haired grandfather ; another of a middle-aged bookkeeper ; the third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Yet , among them , they routinely approve actions that drastically affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of black people. // The officials are unemotional in detailing their government ' s policy for sorting out conflicting black and white claims to this southern African country by , in effect , chopping it to pieces . They often slip into the peculiar argot  --  some critics liken it to Orwellian doublespeak  --  of the South African racial bureaucracy , in which tribal reserves are dubbed " national states " and apartheid , never mentioned by name , is obliquely referred to as " the policy. " // There is a certain wariness , even a halfheartedness , about their discourse , however . Perhaps it is because they have repeated the words so often . Or perhaps they harbor a deep suspicion that , despite their best efforts , few people reading their words will appreciate the essential rightness of their stand. // For many government officials here complain that the outside world simply does not comprehend the magnitude of their problems  --  or the strategy they have chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that South Africa does not , in fact , constitute a single nation . Instead , government theorists argue that it is really a conglomeration of 11 nations , each with its own unique language , culture , and customs. // Ten of these nations are made up of various ethnic groups , such a Zulus , Xhosas , and Tswanas . The remaining nation is defined only as " white " , even though its constituent groups do not necessarily share the same ethnic lineage or mother tongue. // White officials argue that governing South Africa by majority rule in a unitary state is simply out of the question . Whites would be swamped , they warn , by a black majority with markedly different standards and totally alien values. // Moreover , white officials claim , black groups would be unable to agree among themselves on just which one should govern . South Africa would be torn by factional squabbling or , worse , tribal welfare , they predict. // Consequently , the white government has settled on a policy of " separate governments for each national group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over clearly delineated geographical areas , he continues , containing as many black people as possible. // " After all , " he elaborates , " you can ' t have a state without people. " // And the Department of Cooperation and Development is charged with grouping black people into their respective " national states. " // " If you want to have a government ruling its own people , " Serfontein explains , " you must have a consolidation of these particular areas. " // And to have consolidation , he adds , " You must move some people. " // The South African government has done precisely that  --  uprooting between 2 and 3 million black people over the past three decades. // There are myriad philosophical , political , and moral objections to this policy of mass removals . Chief among them is the fact that whites , who make up only about 17 percent of the population here , claim for themselves 86 percent of the land. // But there are other , perhaps even more fundamental , questions about the South African government ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those policies as the methods of carrying them out. // Specifically , once the government sets about creating " separate governments for each national group , " how does it populate the resultant ethnic enclaves carved out of " white " South Africa ? How does it get black people to board the white flatbed trucks it uses to transport them to relocation areas , or camps , as they are sometimes called ? And what do black people find at the end of the ride ? // To begin with , the South African government claims that it does not start removals of black people " unless the people concerned have been thoroughly consulted. " // At a church gathering last year , Lutheran Bishop S. E. Serote recounted some unusual instances of " consultation " prior to the removal of black people from the northern Transvaal Province. // " A 12-year-old child was carried away with the household goods , in the absence of the parents . A mother was carried away in the absence of her husband . Heads of families who were definitely against moving were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by police dogs. " // There are , as we shall see , indications that the government is now relying less on such blatantly strong-arm tactics and more on indirect forms of coercion . For example , at present is trying to force several thousand black people out of St. Wendolin ' s , a township near Durban . Instead of merely bringing in bulldozers to level the dwellings  --  as it has done many times in the past in other locales  --  the government is ordering the black residents to demolish their houses themselves. // The South African government also claims it consults with black people in choosing the areas to which they will be moved. // But Percy Hlope , a resident of Matiwane ' s Kop  --  a black settlement of some 12 , 000 people slated for obliteration because it is in a " white " farming area  --  says he has no firm idea of where government officials are planning to move him and his fellow villagers. // " It is somewhere over there , " he says , gesturing vaguely to the southeast. // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto buses for an advance inspection of the areas to which they are being moved . In a few instances , vociferous complaining has resulted in a change of site for the relocation camp. // The government calls this " negotiation . " But such negotiation has its limits ; staying in their present location is not among the options open to black people under threat of removal , except in rare instances where international publicity has thwarted the government ' s plans. // A government position paper claims that blacks who are removed get " compensatory land of equal pastoral or agricultural value. " // There are important qualifications to that statement , however . Only blacks who own more than 20 morgen of land  --  about 40 acres  --  are entitled to land in the relocation areas . And they are not given the new plots  --  they must purchase them. // The majority of black people removed from white areas have no land , since for the past half-century it has been illegal for them to purchase land outside the tribal reserves. // And there is disagreement over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Mhloleni Mthiyane , whose peoplea are being moved off their acreage on the Indian Ocean coast , says the land they now have grows a wide variety of crops , including tropical fruits . The government is planning to move his people to a stony , drought-prone inland area suitable only for cattle farming , he says . Removal would mean " a total change in the lives of the people , " the chief concludes. // The government claims it adequately compensates black people for the homes they leave behind. // " Compensation is paid for all improvements to the land , " says Mr. Serfontein. // A government position paper claims that " compensation , exceeding 1 , 000 rand $1 , 200 in some cases , is abundant. " // However , the average compensation made in 1979 for families removed from the northern Transvaal Province was only 53 rand ( $63 ) , and many of the families left behind well-maintained homes. // Alfred Mngadi , who was forced to move when a black settlement called Roosboom was demolished , scoffs at the notion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fence enclosing a half-acre plot was valued at only 5 rand ( $6 ) . // Mr. Mngadi contested the government claims , and the valuation was eventually increased threefold . But most black people , he says , simply don ' t know how to take the complicated legal steps required to challenge the government  --  and many are too frightened to do so. // Mngadi also says he was forced to sell his cattle and other livestock when he was moved , and incurred a substantial loss . Other black people voice similar complaints. // The government also claims it provides certain minimum facilities in the relocation camps  --  facilities that , it is claimed , are often lacking at the former sites. // " It is laid-down policy , " says Serfontein , " that we provide water and sanitation at the new site. " // But there are neither water taps nor toilets at some sites in KwaNdebele , the newest tribal reserve now rising from the dusty farmlands of the central Transvaal Province. // And for many other relocation camps , such as Onverwacht  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities amount to nothing more than bucket toilets at the back of each plot . In some camps , only crude pit latrines are provided. // There are apparently no firm standards for water supplies in the relocation camps. // M. G. Lotter , chief director of administration for the Department of Cooperation and Development , says only that " the policy of the department is that the water must be provided within easy reach. " // For the dwellers of the Nondweni relocation camp in northern KwaZulu , " easy reach " often means from a stagnant pool that catches the runoff from cattle pastures . Here , as in other relocation camps , residents complain that the taps installed by the government are inadequate and often run dry. // During periodic droughts , water has to be trucked in to some relocation camps , particularly those in the KwaZulu and Ciskei reserves. // Still , even a part-time water supply would have been welcomed by the people of Qhudeni , a relocation area in desolate mountain terrain north of the town of Kranskop in Natal Province . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency concerned with black removals , no water at all was supplied to the settlement by the government . After five years , a private contractor built a dam for Qhudeni , according to an AFRA worker . But , she adds , some tests indicate the water is severely polluted. // Mr. Serfontein claims that the government also provides clinics and schools in the new locations. // " And a shopping center , " adds Mr. Lotter , helpfully. // That will come as news to the people of Compensation relocation camp , west of the city of Pietermaritzburg . AFRA found that " despite government assurances that nobody is moved before schools , shops , and clinics are available , this basic infrastructure has still not been provided . . . . There are no shops , clinics , churches , community centers , or by arguing that these are the responsibility of the respective " homeland government " in which each camp is relocated. // " Decisions for the removals are taken in full consultation with the homeland governments , " an official government document claims. // Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KwaZulu government . It is " neither consulted nor informed about such removals , " he says. // Moreover , he adds , " The central government has powers which override ours , and we have no option but to countenance the resettlement. " // Well , then , what about the government claim  --  made in an official position paper  --  that " the majority of people are happy to move " ? // There are , no doubt , some people who are happy . One resident of the Rooiston resettlement area , in the northern Transvaal Province , termed his new home area " a good place. " // " The government gave me land free and I can grow tomatoes and mealies corn , " he said. // But if he had a choice of staying in Rooiston or moving back to the white area from which he was evicted , which would he choose ? // " The white area , " was his unhesitating reply. // " Why ? " // " Because the white areas are always better. " // But the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not want to come here , " says Mr. Mngadi , who led resistance to the demolition of Roosboom . " But if you refused , the government would just steamroll your house. " // Some observers hoped that such strong-arm tactics would be abandoned in July 1980 , when Dr. Pieter Koornhof , the minister of cooperation and development , promised an end to forced removals. // But the next month , according to AFRA documents , several carloads of government officials and police converged on Umbulwane , a black residential area in the " white " city of Ladysmith . The officials reportedly told the black people to leave , and bulldozed a number of dwellings. // The officials returned later in the year and , according to residents , knocked down a few more homes . Indeed , a number of partly demolished structures can still be found in Umbulwane at this writing. // Moreover , residents of Umbulwane say they have no other place to go if they are kicked out of their houses  --  despite government assurances that alternative sites are provided as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts say they do detect a new government approach to removals. // But it is not a softening , says Sheena Duncan , an official of the Black Sash women ' s organization . " All that has changed , " she says , " is that the government has gotten a lot more skilled in persuading people to move . " And she gestures to indicate that the word " persuading " should be placed in quotation marks. // This new skill was first applied in Jan Kemp Dorp , a small farming town in the northern Cape Province . Government officials have for years tried to remove some 3 , 000 blacks from a black township called Valspan , on the outskirts of the town. // Because the township was slated for removal , the government steadfastly refused to make improvements . Today Valspan is , in truth , nothing more than a squalid slum , a motley collection of tin and mud shanties with communal toilets and water taps. // But the government has constructed a new township , called Pampierstad , some 15 miles away . Pampierstad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neat four-room dwellings , wide avenues , and new schools and clinics . Each house has indoor water taps and a backyard toilet. // The South African government claims that no one is forced to move to Pampierstad ( although one community leader , M. R. Cwaile , says that some residents are threattened with eviction ) . But the government has also made it clear that no improvements will be made at Valspan. // On the face of it , residents have two fairly straightforward options : stay in an aging , deteriorating township or move to a modern , well-planned new one. // Not surprisingly , the community has split on the issue , with some residents staying on in Valspan and others moving to Pampierstad . For those who move , the decision quickly becomes irrevocable : As soon as they clear out , the government bulldozes their dwellings. // Certainly , each township has its own advantages  --  and its problems . Valspan , despite its squalor , is an easy walk from Jan Kemp Dorp ' s pleasant downtown shopping district . Pampierstad , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland , and an expensive bus ride away from town. // But there is another , altogether more important distinction between the two locales . Valspan is indisputably within the Republic of South Africa , while Pampierstad is in Bophuthatswana , a tribal reserve that has been declared " independent " of South Africa. // Of course , not a single other nation except South Africa has recognized the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana . In fact , there is not so much as a sign marking the imaginary boundary between the two " countries " . Yet the white South African government disclaims responsibility for the black people living beyond the line , insisting they are subjects of Bophuthatswana. // Consequently , the black people of Valspan actually face something of a Hobson ' s choice  --  or , as some critics view it , a Mephistophelean dilemna : They can stay in squalor , or move and forfeit any claim to political rights in the country of their birth. // Black people in other parts of South Africa face similar problems , as the ultimate objective of apartheid  --  denationalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization. // For example , hundreds of thousands of black people have been grouped into Bophuthatswana  --  an ethnic enclave for Tswana-speaking people  --  even though they are not Tswanas . Many complain of harassment and discrimination at the hands of Bophuthatswana authorities . Some non-Tswanas protest that they can not enroll their children in school , receive medical care at state-run clinics or hospitals , or gain access to farmland unless they take out Bophuthatswana " citizenship . " That , of course , would mean forfeiture of South African citizenship. // Consequently , many of these people have fled Bophuthatswana . And often the only place open to them is a relocation camp in some other tribal reserve. // Tens of thousands of Sotho people , for example , have flocked to the Onverwacht resettlement area rather than submit to the Bophuthatswana authorities . And an estimated 100 , 000 Ndebele people have moved out of Bophuthatswana after repeated clashes with authorities there. // They are being placed in a new reserve , called KwaNdebele , northeast of Pretoria . The area is a sprawling mass of tin shanties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking water. // Nevertheless , white South African officials proudly cite this " voluntary " mass movement of people as an example of the " national reawakening of the Ndebele people. " // The white government is already making plans to declare KwaNdebele " independent " of South Africa , with the assent of only a relative handful of tribal officials . And already the Holiday Inn hotel chain is reported to be scouting the area for a site for a gambling casino ( a move that would add another imprimatur of legitimacy on KwaNdebele ' s " independence , " since casino gambling is illegal in " white " South Africa ) . // Meanwhile , many of the women in the area are selling off their heirlooms  --  such as the distinctive beaded aprons that mark their progression through adolescence and marriage. // " The people in KwaNdebele are desperate , " says an official of the South African Institute of Race Relations , in explaining an act analogous to American women parting with engagement and wedding rings. // Nevertheless , Mr. Serfontein says the creation of KwaNdebele is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government policy  --  " separate governments for each national group. " // But , to one relief worker in the area , it is something quite different , indeed. // " Generally , I would say a farmer treats his cattle better than these people are treated , " he says. // " Because a farmer , before he herds his cattle onto a piece of ground , at least makes sure they have food and water . These people have nothing . They ' re just left  --  on empty ground. " // Tomorrow : What the futute might hold for South Africa ' s uprooted peoples. // //
