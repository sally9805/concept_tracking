Followers of the frequently entertaining Independent Players may have noticed that the Elgin theater group has been rather quiet of late . However , they ' re back with a new show this month , their first since last August , and they have announced a full 1985 calendar of six productions . The Players are winding up a three-week run of the hit musical comedy " They ' re Playing Our Song " at 8 p. m . Friday and Saturday in the lower level playhouse of the Hemmens Auditorium in downtown Elgin . Opening weekend was distinguished by large audiences of the group ' s faithful , providing new hope that the Players can put its past season , when it accumulated nettlesome budget deficits , behind it . " We ended 1984 with some financial shortages , and so we ' re reorganizing our board of directors by adding new members with solid business experience , " explains Donald Haefliger , a teacher at Elgin ' s St. Edward High School who also is the executive director of the Players in his spare time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of our shows , but we didn ' t . " The group staged five plays last year , including a very fine original music revue titled " Easy Street . " But the new Hemmens space , with a capacity of 200 , cost $1 , 500 per show , about triple the rent at the group ' s former home in the Elgin Elks Club . Audiences averaged roughly half of capacity  --  not enough to pay all the bills . To cut costs this year , the Players will do just three plays at Hemmens , with " Arsenic and Old Lace " due next in July . To fill in the gaps , for the first time the group will produce three semi-staged workshop productions at local libraries and schools . The plays will be more daring than the company ' s main fare : Sam Shepard ' s " True West " tentatively is scheduled for March . " They ' re Playing Our Song " will be directed by Charles Golliher , who oversaw an ambitious " Who ' s Afraid of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars will be two newcomers , Jeff Jones of St. Charles and Debbie Grennan of Crystal Lake . Jones is the former director of Percheron Productions , while Grennan is a regular performer at the Woodstock Opera House . In keeping with its budget-balancing ambitions , the Players have raised ticket prices to $7 this season ( they were $6 last year ) . For information , phone 931-5125 . In Chicago Heights , the Drama Group also is seeking to rebound from financial disappointment . The company ' s expensive mounting of the musical comedy " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum " last November barely broke even . Such musical blockbusters usually are solid moneymakers for the group , but this time empty seats abounded . Early ticket sales are more encouraging for this weekend ' s production of the old Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur comedy , " The Front Page . " It will be performed at 8 p. m . Friday and Saturday and 7 p. m . Sunday in the Bloom High School Auditorium , 10th Street and Dixie Highway in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a large membership of 200 and a big stage at Bloom , so we thought ' Front Page ' would be just right for us , " says Denise Chilcote , a spokeswoman for the group . Auditions for the Drama Group ' s " Annie , " scheduled to run on Memorial Day weekend , are Feb. 27 to March 2 at the Studio Building , 330 W. 202nd St. in Chicago Heights . Chilcote will lead a small company of actors to Springfield on March 8 to perform in the Illinois Community Theatre Association ' s annual festival competition . They will perform excerpts from Christopher Durang ' s 1981 comedy , " Beyond Therapy. "
