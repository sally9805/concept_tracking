I can not tell you how many young ladies write to me and say , Miss Piggy , if only I could find an interesting , rewarding career like yours  --  one with excitement , travel and glamour . Goodness knows , I sympathize with their predicament . I moiself spent many years engaged in assorted occupations , which were frankly unworthy of a person of my many gifts , before I stumbled on this one basic secret of success : If you 're properly attired , you 're hired . And if you 're not , I do n't care how " qualified " you may be  --  it will be a case of " clothes , but no cigar ! ' Dressed to Skill Look around you . Do you ever see a brain surgeon in a tutu or a high-priced attorney in gingham ? Of course not . Persons working in the more challenging fields know that it is expected of them to dress appropriately . And what is true of the impression you make on the public is even more true when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wish to pursue a career in the interesting construction field , you certainly do not want to show up for an interview in an outfit that features a stylish beret , a beaded bag , an understated suit and stiletto heels . A clipboard , a nice little lunchbox and a hat a brick will bounce off of are far more effective in demonstrating your basic grasp of your chosen vocation . All very well , I can hear you protesting , but , Miss Piggy , what good is it if I can dress like a chemist ( demure white coat , a fairly simple hairstyle , a few really good pens in your pocket ) or a psychiatrist ( conservative skirt  --  light plaid or tweed  --  plain white or solid-color pastel blouse , a simple necklace and a pretty notepad with a nice cover ) when I do n't know the difference between a Bunsen burner and some nutbar with fritzophrenia ? Well , the simple fact is that everyone in just about every occupation picked up everything he needed to know " on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don'task him him to tell me what he knows about the Edict of Aunts or why Charlemagne Bonaparte lost the Battle of Honeydew to the Melons . And just like everybody else in his profession , for the first few weeks he spent his time wandering around asking what all the different nasty little tools were for and where the button was that fills the paper cup with pink mouthwash and how to get all those old magazines . Of course , no matter what profession you choose to enter , you are going to have to pick up a few bits of jargon , like " I hereby issue a writ of hocus-pocus " or " Redemnify this convertible debenture and put white sidewalls on it and shine its coupons " or " Give me full power in the flaps and vents , and lower the tassels . " And you will have some catching up to do , because in some professions , like law , many people have been to schools where they were taught useful phrases , how much to charge and  --  most important  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must have the gift of gab , but it is the gift of garb that will provide you with that vital first break . Choosing a Fashionable Future When you are trying to decide on a career , do n't get sidetracked early on by minor considerations like prestige , starting salary and various benefits . Here is a handy checklist for evaluating how well your career will " wear " in years to come : 1 . Does the career of your choice involve a strict style of dress that you will still have to be happy with five years from now ? Ten ? 2 . Does your chosen career offer an opportunity for genuine fashion growth ? 3 . Does your career choice provide for a proper lunch hour ? I just can not emphasize this aspect of prospective employment too strongly . Some otherwise very desirable occupations have absurdly short periods set aside for luncheon  --  in some cases , as little as one hour or even less ! It is worth considering that in an average 35-year career , you should expect to spend no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever ? " lunch " is quite properly a very loose term ) . 4 . Does the career you have selected make possible imaginative and elegant office decor ? Try to get a look at the offices of the leaders of your profession . Are they cramped , sparse little dungeons , cluttered with messy papers , bulky office machinery and depressing metal cabinets , or are they cozy , comfortable living rooms with soft chairs , pretty pictures and plush carpets ? Moi Cuisine Speaking of success , I just adore cooking , whether it is a little meal for moiself , a romantic supper for Kermit or a dinner for a few dear friends . Unfortunately , I have so little time in my busy career that I must limit myself to just two basic kinds of cooking : very simple things that can be prepared with an absolute minimum of time and fuss or much more elaborate recipes that can be cooked and served entirely by others and eaten in their homes . In this article I have listed just a few of my most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with delightful , delectable , despeedy and decheap meals of your own . A Culinary " Flight of Fancy " There is absolutely no reason why everyone ca n't enjoy airline cooking at home . It is not only a very convenient way to dine  --  for one thing , your kitchen does n't have that awful " cooked-in " look when you 're finished  --  but it also lends a welcome touch of adventure to even the most ordinary occasion . And since everything is designed to be served cold , it can be prepared days , even weeks , ahead of time . Everything should be shiny and wrapped up in teensy packages , boxes or cups and served with plastic knives and forks and glasses on a foil tray . Little cheese and cracker packs , spreads that come in tubes , bags full of miniature candy bars , cups of coleslaw and potato salad from the deli and jelly in those tiny plastic tubs are ideal plane food . Just to add to the festive mood , before dinner I show everyone where all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to use as seat belts . When dinner is served , I turn on a vacuum cleaner in the bedroom for a little realistic engine noise , and every now and then I give the table a jolt with my knee and remark , " Do n't worry , it is just light turbulence  --  we will be through it in a moment . " I also point out things in the room that guests sitting in various seats can see . " You folks on the right side of the table can get a nice view of the plants in the corner and my sofa , " I might say , " and if you look down , you can see my new carpet . " When they get up to leave , I ask them to make sure they have all their personal belongings and give each one a complimentary plastic fork as a souvenir . Dinner de Take-Out fi la Belle Telephone Smart chefs realize that the easiest cookbook to use is the Yellow Pages and the handiest appliance in the kitchen is the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than with your oven , your broiler , your blender and all your pots and pans combined . It 's a pleasure to use  --  it is just about impossible to burn yourself on it or cut yourself with it  --  and best of all , when you 're finished with it , it does n't need to be washed . Moi , I prefer the pushbutton models , but the old-fashioned dial types , though a teensy bit slower and a trifle hard on the fingers , work just as well . Here 's a sample recipe : Chinese Banquet 1 . Dial 555-6780 2 . Give order 3 . No MSG , please ! 4 . Ask for extra fortune cookies 5 . Give name and address 6 . Get purse out Note : The noodle dishes are terrible ; no deliveries after 10 p.m . Of course , Chinese food is not the only cuisine you can " cook " with your telephone . And in fact , if I have guests over , I like to call several different places and put together a " Snacks de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the order they arrive . It adds a nice bit of suspense to an already festive occasion as everyone tries to guess what 's going to come through the door next ! It is often said that cooking is an art , but I have had very few meals that I would hang on my wall . The truth is , food is awfully drab-looking most of the time . And thefew foods that really are pretty , like turnips and beets and wax beans , taste as if you ate your purse by mistake . But with a little bit of food coloring , , you can transform even the most lackluster entr  --  e into a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach . Scrambled eggs are so much more appealing when they are purple , and a commonplace spaghetti dinner becomes rare and exciting if you cook it in three different batches  --  say , orange , green and pink  --  and then mix them all together . And just imagine the cries of pleasure and surprise you will hear when you serve your guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milkshake ! ( A word of warning : Gray or black food'makes people nervous . ) How to Make Food French One of the easiest ways to spice up a simple meal is to make it French . All you need is a pair of pinking shears , lots of those little ruffled paper hats they put on lamb chops and a serving plate with a big round cover that has a handle on it . Use the shears to cut around the outside of anything fairly thin and hard , like slices of cucumber or cheese or bread , to give them that nice serrated edge . When you serve your guests , take everything to the table in the big dish , then lift off the cover with a dramatic flourish and say , for example , " Sandwich de Butter de Peanut avec Jellee sur bed of Potatoes Chippee , and , on la side , les Pickles avec Little Hats on Them . " Instantly , your dining companions are magically transported to a Parisian cafe , and even the most familiar fare is given a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles of soft drinks wrapped in napkins in a bucket full of ice . Pour a little into your own glass , slosh it around , take a taste and say , " Hmmm , a very nice grapefruit soda , with plenty of body and a good bouquet  --  it will develop a little more roundness if left in the refrigerator for another day or two , but frankly I think it 's ready to drink right now , " then fill your guests ' glasses . Bon appetit ! Dear Miss Piggy , All of my plants , which were once so nice and green , have turned brown and died . What should I do ? Bereft Dear Bereft , That is truly sad . And green is such a pretty color . ... But cheer up . Plants are just like lamps . You plug them in and they turn right on .
