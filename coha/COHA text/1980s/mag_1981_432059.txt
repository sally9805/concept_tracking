 | THE WHOLE OPERATION went off like clockwork , with Kannan serving as the mainspring . P. Kannan , an agent of India 's Directorate of Wildlife Preservation , wages a constant war against dealers in illegal reptile skins . A large , well-proportioned , benignlooking man , carrying a briefcase and tending toward open-necked sport shirts , he appears more an accountant than a detective . His shoes make an unstealthy scritch scritch sound , one that must haunt the dreams of more than 20 Bombay merchants he has subpoenaed since early 1979 . The careful planning of the Indian law officer was evident when I stood in a Bombay shop bargaining for a legal jacket of cowhide . A man with a turban as black as his neatly trimmed beard walked in the door and bought a lizard-skin wallet ; after pocketing the receipt , he showed the identification of a wildlife inspector .  | " You have sold goods that violate the Wildlife Protection Act , " he told the startled clerk . " The agent in charge will arrive soon to begin proceedings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kannan 's shoes , an ominous sound like the creak of a slowly opening door in a horror movie , promising soon-to-bedisclosed details , probably unpleasant . Unpleasantness for those trading illegally in wild animals and their products is escalating around the world . Within the past decade government after government has passed laws to restrict or prohibit the sale of wildlife seriously depleted by hunting and habitat destruction . With legal channels pinched , animal dealers have resorted to nefarious schemes to continue the flow . Wildlife is big business . Exoticbird collectors will pay $10,000 for a hyacinth macaw . At Saks Fifth Avenue in New York I tried on a pair of trendy western boots trimmed in lizard skin . The price ? " Two hundred thirty-five , " the clerk said , with an archness suggesting that most of his customers did n't bother to ask . At Harrods department store in London I peered into a display case at wallets of crocodile hide selling for more than ? 250 apiece ( about $600 ) . In Paris , Christian Dior 's channels sorted to flow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d , with an is custom- director of fur design , Frederic Castet , let me fondle a downy coat made from the belly fur of 17 lynx and priced at $100,000 . " We make only two a year because of restrictions on lynx trade , " he explained . " But we could sell many more . " These items are being sold legally . But somewhere in the dim beginnings of their trail through commerce , they may have been acquired illegally . The hyacinth macaw , for example , is found principally in Brazil , which bans its export . Most shipments to the United States come from Paraguay and Bolivia , which have very few . Ornithologists familiar with @#  | the area say that most of these macaw shipments were smuggled across the border from Brazil . The lizard boots , the crocodile wallets , and a host of other wild animals or their products may have the same questionable legal history . According to the latest figures from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) , some 422,000 live birds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in 1979 . Raw wildlife hides and skins totaled 11.8 million . Of individual items made from wild animals , 129.6 million were imported that same year . This fascination with wildlife within the affluent nations of the world adds to the disappearance of animals in the less developed countries . In between stand the illegal traders , willing to circumvent wildlifeprotection laws to satisfy the demand and their own pocketbooks . FWS estimates that for every ten shipments of wild animals or their products that enter the United States by proper channels , at least one and perhaps as many as four shipments enter illegally , at a large profit to the smuggler . The recent trial of a Philadelphia animal dealer revealed that Fiji Islands lizards , purchased illegally in the Far East or $20 a pair , were sold in this country for $550 . The U. S. Department of Justice estimates the total value of such entries as anywhere from 50 to 100 million dollars a year . Wildlife smuggling is costing the U. S. millions of dollars to control and is denying income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty from legal imports . It has spread diseases that would have @#  | been detected in legal quarantine periods . An outbreak of Newcastle disease ? carried by exotic birds and fatal to domestic poultry ? in California in 1971 cost 56 million dollars to control . U. S. Department of Agriculture officials say an outbreak of major proportions could cost a quarter of a billion dollars to eradicate . An irreversible effect of illegal trade could be the extinction of animal species that are finding fewer and fewer places to hide . Of an estimated 13,200 species of mammals and birds known in the 17th century , more than 130 are gone forever and another 240 are considered endangered , together with many reptiles , amphibians , fishes , and invertebrates . Most losses and near losses can be traced to man 's activities , either from hunting or habitat destruction . " No imaginable consumption can threaten animals if they have sufficient habitat into which they can retreat , " I was told by William Conway , director of the New York Zoological Society . " But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 acres every minute ? excessive trade can contribute to the downfall of some . " The worst thing about the wildlife trade is that it provides things for people who do not need them . No one really needs a leopard coat . And certainly not a toucan . " WILDLIFE TRADE is probably as old as currency , and illegal wildlife trade must date to the first conservation laws . In the U. S. , the Lacey Act of 1935 prohibited importation into this country of any wildlife acquired illegally in another country . The U. S. Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1969 banned U. S. import of any animals on the Endangered Species List . Other governments passed laws too , but enforcement was rare . " Until recently , few of us knew one species from another , " a U. S. customs officer told me candidly . " You just sort of glanced at the shipping papers that came with them and waved them on through . " The first serious effort to control all wildlife sales and plug the smuggling leaks took place in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met to draft the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) . The @# complex mechanism that evolved has been called the most remarkable trade pact ever devised . " It 's like issuing passports for animals ? dead or alive ? that pass from one country to another , " a Hong Kong customs official told me . CITES divided wildlife into three categories , or appendixes : Appendix I ? dangerously threatened with extinction and therefore banned from any commercial trade , such as the rhinoceros and seven of the eight races of tigers . Appendix II ? potentially threatened , but  | commerce can take place if shipments are accompanied by authorizing documents from the country of export . The American alligator is listed on Appendix IT , for example , and can be traded , while the U. S. crocodile is on Appendix I and can not . Appendix III ? not considered endangered by the world at large , but listed by some countries where they originate , out of concern for their existence there . The scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bans its export because it is rare in that country . Any nation that ratifies the treaty is expected to honor the three categories . " It puts the burden of detection on the importing countries , " said a convention delegate . " If an item does n't have the proper papers , do n't let it in . " Drafted in 1973 , put into effect in 1975 , CITES underwent a sluggish start . In March 1979 the delegates met in San Jose , Costa Rica , and the embers of trade control were fanned into flame . Two years after San Jose , more than 60 nations have signed and ratified the treaty . Enforcement worldwide has toughened , and smugglers and illegal traders are getting a taste of what it 's like to be hunted . An organization called TRAFFIC ( Trade Records Analysis of Fauna and Flora in Commerce ) , supported mostly by the World Wildlife Fund , now monitors the movement of animal products around the world . The information is supplied upon request to government , CITES officials , and conservationists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nairobi ; others are planned for Frankfurt and Tokyo . " Before TRAFFIC there was no single reliable source of data about the amounts of animals and animal products being moved around the world , " said Nicole Duplaix , director of the Washington office and one of the founders of the organization . " If the enforcement agencies around the world have been the arm of the law to stop smuggling , we have been the arm of documentation . With war declared on animal smugglers . photographer Steve Raymer and I made an assessment of the battlegrounds . We visited areas where wildlife is captured , cities where it is collected by animal merchants for dispersal abroad , and the affluent countries where it is purchased . To those concerned about wildlife trade . the good news is that stricter enforcement has curbed the activities of smugglers , perhaps cut them drastically . Some who once operated openly were driven underground by CITES , sometimes so deeply that we had to go there to assure ourselves that illega. trade existed . The bad news : We were able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park warden Phil Snyder 's whispered warning seemed to chase a swarm of butterflies up my back . Five of us on an antipoaching patrol peered around a clump of foliage into a clearing in central Kenya 's Aberdare National Park . Less than 100 yards away . a black rhinoceros stood broadside to us. stamping his three-toed feet angrily , swinging his head quickly in one direction , then another . He sensed the presence of intruders but , with his poor eyesight and upwind position , could not locate us . I had always thought the two horns growing out of a rhino 's nose to be blunt . This fellow 's scimitarlike weaponry , typical of the wild black rhino , looked capable of skewering a man like a barbecue spit . That unique protection is also becoming the animals downfall . Wealthy North Yemenis will pay $6,000 for a jarbiyya , the traditional dagger , when the handle is made of rhino horn ( page 301 ) . Many Easterners believe powdered rhino horn holds medicinal powers . Demand for it has reduced the black rhino ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant populations totaling perhaps 15,000 to 25,000 . More than 15,000 existed in Kenya 296 National Geographic , March 19 , i , :  | alone in 1969 , according to a study by zoologistA . K. K. " Kes " Hillman . Ten years later Kenya 's total stood around 1,500 and was still falling . Elsewhere , the Sumatran , Javan , and great Indian rhinos together probably number fewer than 2,000 , and the white rhino , found mostly in South Africa , survives under close supervision . The trend suggests that this nearsighted thick-skinned juggernaut may be the next large mammal to disappear from the earth . In Kenya the American-born warden Phil Snyder and his patrol were hunting the poachers who hunt the rhinos . We found none that day , and the rhino , not finding us , lost interest and trotted away . " Without these patrols there would be r.o rhinos here within three weeks , " said Snyder 's assistant , Kamaw Hugangin . Months later and thousands of miles away I was offered rhino horn in a pharmacy on Macao , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young clerks , grinning broadly , produced a whittled chunk c bonelike gray , at a price of $450 an ounce Many Eastern men consider rhino horn an aphrodisiac , although there exists no evidence to support the belief .

Scientifically , men with waning sexual powers could obtain the same results by eating hair trimmings am chewing their fingernails .  | I WANDERED THROUGH alleys in crowded Bangkok until I heard a cacophony of bird sounds behind a high wall . Five dogs rushed the iron gate as I knocked , but polite attendants quieted them and let me in . Inside I found an ark of animals from the shrinking Thai rain forest ? tree shrews , pythons thick as my thigh , a tumuIt of birds , terrified civet cats that spat from dark corners of their cages , slowmoving lorises with round eyes like goblins . I asked the owner , a well-dressed woman in her 30s , if it would be possible for someone to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . ( Both animals are banned from international commerce under the CITES Appendix I rating . ) She looked at me carefully , then looked away . " It would be difficult , " she said .

" HE LOOKED every inch the successful Singapore businessman ? flashy finger rings , gold digital watch , clothes made by the best Oriental tailors . " I 've made a great deal of money in the animal trade , " he said . " But I 'm getting out of the business . It 's getting too difficult , too many regulations . " But he knew exactly how the illegal trading was done , especially with exotic birds from Australia , which bans their export . In p 300 a Singapore hotel , he sketched maps tracing the feather trail through the Far East . " A fishing boat is chartered and sailed to Bali , then to the east coast of Australia , outside the Great Barrier Reef , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dash to shore and pick up perhaps 2,000 birds ? roseate cockatoos , sulfur-crested cockatoos. and parakeets . " The smugglers return to Indonesia and buy papers saying that that 's where the birds are from . Then the birds are taken ashore under cover in Singapore and sold , mostly to European dealers . After expenses , such a trip can clear a million dollars . " So much for so few birds ? " Bird collectors in Europe and the United States will pay $12,000 for a pair of goldenshouldered parakeets , " he said . " Brown parakeets and Naretha bluebonnet parakeets go for $8,000 to $10,000 . " Of course , there is the chance that the trip may make nothing . Each cage has a rope tied to it with a rock at the end . If a patrol boat chases them , the smugglers can dump the birds overboard .

" Some of the people doing it have political connections , " he said . The culprits are not always big operators . On Grand Cayman in the Caribbean , the saleswoman in a gift shop encouraged me to buy jewelry made from the shell of a green sea turtle . Even though this species is grown for market in a shore turtle farm here , all sea turtle products are banned from United States import . " It 's very small , easy to hide in your suitcase , " the saleswoman said , with a nonchalance that suggested long practice and past success . Bird-loving Belgians flock each week to the Sunday market in Brussels ' Grand ' Place to ogle exotic species from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a distinguished-looking gray-haired gentleman there , who added that he keeps a backyard aviary of some 50 birds . " Most of these birds are common waxbills and finches , but it is possible to buy others that are very rare , nearly extinct . " " How does one do that ? " " I know , " he said with a smile and a wink , " but I can not tell you . " PERHAPS no single product is more synonymous with the illegal wildlife trade than elephant ivory . It touches all the major aspects of the problem ? poaching , bribery , high profits , worldwide distribution , and an animal that finds it almost impossible to hide . One of the world 's precious commodities since biblical times , ivory sold for about $10 a kilogram ( 2.2 lbs. ) during the first half of this century . The price shot to $100 a kilo in the mid- ' 70s before settling back to the present $74 .

Many people around the world are buying raw 302 tusks and hoarding them because they believe the elephant will become extinct and the price will soar . Most African countries have limitations on their ivory exports , but official-looking documents can often be bought . After they are sold and resold in international markets , their origin becomes increasingly vague , until no one can say whether a carved figurine for sale in a Hong Kong ivory shop came @#  | from an elephant that was legally harvested , poached with a poisoned arrow , or one ied of natural causes . Joseph Kioko lives on the front lines of the poaching problem . The 35-year-old Kenyan is warden for the eastern portion of Kenya 's Tsavo National Park . To protect the elephants and rhinos , he supervises 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of Connecticut . " We 've found groups of as many as ten elephants , fallen close together , " he told me  | one morning as he made the day 's patrol assignments at park headquarters . " You could tell they were just mowed down by poachers with automatic weapons . " The body count is not always in animals . Two park rangers and 20 poachers ? most of them drought-poor Somalis from Kenya 's neighbor to the east ? have been killed in shootouts . " It 's like a war , " said Joe , who has been fired at while flying surveillance of his park in a light plane . The problems encountered by Joe Kioko are universal . In 1979 two game wardens were killed and five seriously wounded in Thailand , where diminishing rain forests have long been a reservoir of birds , reptiles , and primates for research . " We have 24 wildlife sanctuaries , but only 215 guards , " I was told by Pramote Saiwichian of the Wildlife Conservation Division . " We hope to hire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . " The actual killing or capturing of the animals is usually the work of villagers , who then sell them to dealers . " You have to remember that many locals have always made their living by selling wildlife , " said Angel Paucar , head of Ecuador 's wildlife section . " For them , it is an economic necessity . " His solution : " We have declared large areas of our Amazon Basin as national parks . The Indians there will undergo training and become salaried as park guards . Instead of killing the animals , they will be paid @# to protect them . . . if we can get money to finance the project . " " There is a reluctance on the part of governments to spend money on wildlife , because they do not see the immediate economic return , " a wildlife official in India told me . " They prefer to spend money on development schemes that bring in big cash . " Kenya banned all hunting in 1974 in hopes of rebuilding the game stocks that draw tourists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars for the project . But a hunting ban does not necessarily amount to a trade ban . Ivory , rhino horn , and catskins have continued to leak out of Kenya , sometimes with the help of public officials . Kenya 's harshest critics concede , though , that corruption there is decreasing . PROPOSED NEW U. S. legislation would tighten the restrictions on ivory coming into the country . A 1980 bill for elephant protection would allow imports only from those nations that can prove they are practicing strict measures of elephant management . The bill passed the House of Representatives , where it originated , but died in the Senate . It is almost certain to be reintroduced , and possibly broadened to cover all endangered species . Strict though the measures may be for the African tusks , the United States has another problem to resolve with ivory produced @# 305  | within its own borders ? the tusks of Alaskan walruses . Most of the U. S. ivory-carving industry originated from scrimshaw ? the etching of pictures on the teeth of sperm whales by early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Hawaiian Islands shifted to walrus tusks , then to elephant ivory when walrus kills were regulated . With interstate commerce in sperm whale teeth now banned in the U. S. and elephant-ivory imports reduced , traffic in walrus ivory has escalated . Although the walrus population has been creeping upward , so has the number of walrus kills ? to more than 5,000 annually . Under the U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act , walrus hunting in Alaska is strictly limited . Walrus tusks may be sold only by native peoples who have worked them into " authentic handicrafts . " In the seaside town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui , I entered shop after shop displaying walrus ivory etched with seafaring scenes , for sale to tourists . Sailors in striped T-shirts hauled in a mainsail on one tusk . A clipper ship sailed across another piece , which sold for $775 . The names of the artists did not sound native Alaskan . I telephoned the artist who signed the clipper-ship tusk . Is the fresh ivory " worked as an authentic native handicraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes it just has the Eskimo 's initials carved at one end , " he admitted . " I 've even gotten them with ball-point pen scribblings on them . " Wildlife laws are only as good as the officials who inspect shipments in and out of countries . In the United States , customs officers are attending seminars taught by animal experts , and visiting zoos and museums to see and identify exotic species . Tourists as well as big-time smugglers are feeling the new emphasis . I visited an " evidence room " in Honolulu , where hundreds of items seized from individual travelers were piled to the ceiling . They included leopardskin coats , carved whales ' teeth , and some 800 hawksbill and green sea turtle shells ? all illegal according to CITES and the U. S. Endangered Species Act . " Please , tell people to check regulations before they buy things abroad , " pleaded agent James Bartee 308 of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service . " We do n't like to take these things from them . " Customs and FWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of Agriculture may be called in to provide positive identification of the animals being shipped . If any question arises , the agencies refer shipments to outside experts . I watched customs inspectors Randy Karavanich and Maryanne Noonan at Los Angeles International one day as they checked crates of monkeys imported for research Everything seemed in order ? clean cages . healthy animals , shipping documents . " The papers say they came from Guatemala , " said Randy . " But I 've never seen a Guatemala permit before , so I would n't know if this one is false . We 'd better have Roy take a look at it . " Roy Simpson , the Fish and Wildlife inspector on duty , is a quiet , bookish man . with an eye for detail . He peered at the monkeys and pored over a manual explaining trade requirements . " One man 's name , and no other , should be on any shipment from Guatemala , " he said . " It 's missing from these papers . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby holding station while the case was being investigated . If the final decision went against the importers , the ammals might later be given to a zoo . Randy slapped seizure stickers on the cages , at the same time telling the occupants in mock seriousness , " All right , you guys are being seized . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you chatter may be used against you . " ADVISING MONKEYS of their rights is a laughing matter , but convicted smugglers are finding little humor in penalties they now receive in the United States . The emphasis changed in August 1979 with a presidential directive calling for more attention to illegal animal trade . A special wildife section committed to stricter enforcement was created within the Department of Justice . The new section 's eight attorneys , headed by lawyer and wildlife expert Kenneth Berlin , aid U. S. attorneys in prosecuting cases at the designated ports  | where wildlife shipments may enter ? New York , Miami , New Orleans , Chicago , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , special task forces are being set up around the nation to combine the efforts of Justice , Fish and Wildlife , Customs , National Marine Fisheries , and the Department of Agriculture . " We 're committing the expertise of all these agencies to individual wildlife cases , instead of having each one conduct its own investigations , " Berlin told me in Los Angeles . It 's working . A case investigated and prosecuted by the task force in that city resulted in a $10,000 fine for the company importing the wildlife , an 18-month jail sentence for the principal defendant , and shorter terms for two associates . The most celebrated wildlife case so far took place in Philadelphia in 1979 , where animal dealer Henry Molt was convicted for illegally importing reptiles into the United States from Fiji and Papua New Guinea . He was sentenced to 14 months in prison and prohibited from importing any reptiles for a three-year probation period . Molt is appealing the verdict . There is action on the international front as well . " The battle against illegal wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation they did n't have before , " said Dr. Gerard Bertrand , who has traveled worldwide for FWS , exporting American conservation techniques . " And there 's no question about what started it all ? CITES . " This " most remarkable trade pact " has its weaknesses , admits Peter Sand , the highenergy Bavarian lawyer who heads the CITES Secretariat . " The treaty allows member nations to take exception ' to some trade restrictions , " he told me at CITES headquarters in Gland , Switzerland . " France , Italy , West Germany , Japan , and Switzerland all take exception to the ban on saltwater crocodiles , for example , because they process the skins into leather goods . And since they make most of the world 's handbags , shoes , belts , and other crocodile-skin products , their exceptions undermine the CITES attempt to protect the species . " Regulation alone probably can not stop wildlife trade . " You ca n't cut off trade completely when demand exists for the product , " a French tanner of crocodile hides told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only answer to saving endangered species is to farm them . " MANAGING WILDLIFE to meet the demand for their products is inevitable , I heard from conservationists , animal dealers , tanners , bureaucrats , and illegal traders . Management may include as large an operation as the great South African game reserves , where elephants , lions , and other trophy animals are carefully protected and regularly culled to prevent overcrowding . Such a controlled harvest can reap national income from hunting fees and tourism . In Papua New Guinea , crocodile ranching has become a national goal . " The idea is to encourage villagers to capture the small wild crocs that suffer high mortality anyway and raise them to selling size , " said Melvin Bolton , the United Nations ' project manager . The U.N . has provided funds and technical assistance for the project . " It 's not easy . These are people with traditions of hunting , not day-to-day ranching responsibilities . " Villagers at Mamber , a collection of stiltlegged huts along the broad Sepik River in the northwest , are accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them to four croc pens enclosed by vertical log walls . Several sets of periscopic eyes peered from muddy pools . It takes two years for a captured yearling croc fed on netted fish to attain a belly width of 15 inches , proper selling size . Mamber hoped to sell the first crop of 14 for about $150 apiece within a year . " Eventually we 'll sell 20 a year , " said villager Moses Gawi . " We 'll use the money for improvements to the village , such as a pump to bring a better water supply . " Two large ranching operations , both owned by Papuans and managed by Australians , are under way at Lae and Port Moresby . Both fatten their charges on offal from their own chicken-processing plants , which operate simultaneously . Croc-skin sales for gild Cargo : the Business of Smuggling Animals 309  | these large-scale operations could number in the thousands annually . An exception to the CITES ban on saltwater croc sales has been granted Papua New Guinea . The project is seen as a possible pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tigers , or cheetahs ? The problem is one of identification . Who can tell whether a saltwater crocodile skin was raised or poached ? Conservationists argue that farming an endangered species creates a market for it and encourages poaching of the animals still running wild . Dealers claim the demand will always be there and might as well be accommodated legally . The world 's first green sea turtle farm brought the argument to the courts . CITES lists the green sea turtle as Appendix I but allows trade if it is born and raised in captivity . Cayman Turtle Farm on Grand Cayman in the Caribbean meets those requirements , said its manager , William Johnson , as we walked past concrete tanks filled flipper to flipper with turtles . Fed high-protein pellets , they reach growth of about 80 pounds within three years before being butchered . The farm markets the shells as jewelry and wall hangings , the oil for cosmetics . meat for steaks , fatty calipee for soup , and flipper skin for leather goods . In the farm 's early days , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches said to be doomed to erosior . Now , he says , the entire stock comes from the breeding females . Oval submarines with shells four fee ? across , they glide through the clear water c : the large breeding pool with a smooth flipper motion that resembles flying . The largest weighs about 600 pounds . A sand beach lines one side of the pool , so the females can  | lumber ashore to lay their eggs , which are gathered and artificially incubated . In 1978 the U. S. Departments of the Interior and Commerce banned import of all sea turtle products into the United States regardless of origin . The agencies argued that sale of the products created a market that encouraged the poaching of turtles in the wild . They added that success of the Cayman farm might encourage the establishment of similar companies , whose start-up operations might also require collection of eggs from the wild . The farm filed suit against the U. S. agencies to stop the embargo on their products , arguing that their operation met the requirements of the CITES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that hatching thousands of eggs annually adds to the sea turtle population . The U. S. argument was upheld ; the farm is appealing the decision . ADEQUATE SPACE exists for both people and wildlife , in the opinion of most biologists , with the establishment of properly enforced game preserves . But no preserve is safe as long as there exists a demand for the creatures and their products , thus encouraging illicit traffic . As human population pressures continue , many nondefenders of wildlife argue , " Who deserves the space more , people or animals ? " Nalni D. Jayal , an Indian government conservationist , does not consider it a matter of choice . He sees wild animals as an important measuring stick for the state of the world . " The earth has developed a successful ecosystem , and the presence of all creatures in it is a sign that it is still healthy , " he told me in New Delhi . " When we destroy any part of it , we destroy a bit of ourselves . " In his country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monitor lizard and the hooded cobra are popular tourist bargains .

Twenty percent of the annual food production is eaten by rats and mice , none of which are eaten by handbags . OVER MONTHS of searching for illegal trade , I found the prey progressively more elusive . Traders and dealers told me they were going out of business or shifting their emphasis to legitimate animals . Time after time I traveled to locations where , I had been told , the trade was particularly heavy and blatant . Time after time it was gone , or forced deep into hiding when I arrived . At best , the funnel of illegal wildlife became a sieve , in which the holes are slowly being plugged . A drip can empty a vessel , but the slower flow at least buys time for earth 's endangered animals . Can they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sacrificed to doomsday choices such as whether people or animals deserve to live on the earth ? After I had heard the " people or animals " question posed a third time on as many continents , I decided to submit the idea to cold logic . I imagined a cosmic jury considering the evidence . On the one hand , the case is argued for the animals , whose ancestors preceded man 's on earth , and who for the most part maintained a system of checks and balances on their numbers . On the other hand , the case of man is brought forth . A relatively helpless creature save for a marvelous brain , this comparatively recent addition brought the ability to articulate an appreciation of the world and developed the potential to ease pain and hardship for all its inhabitants . But man also brought killing for fun and for decoration ? killing that began to upset nature 's delicate balance . The evidence is in .
