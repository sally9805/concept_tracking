For Daisy , Kat and Jojo , there just may be life after " Mystic Pizza. " // That ' s because Samuel Goldwyn Jr. , the head of the Samuel Goldwyn Company and the executive producer of the new film " Mystic Pizza , " is fascinated by the idea of doing for his fictional heroines what Michael Apted did for the real-life subjects of his widely acclaimed documentaries " 7 Up , " " 14 Up " and " 28 Up " - looking in on them again a few years later as they face new turning points along the road of life. // " I ' ve always been fascinated by the subject of women coming of age and various crisis periods of their lives and dying to do a film about it , " said Mr. Goldwyn as he sketched the origins of " Mystic Pizza . " " I was looking for this subject . And I got hold of a script which Amy Jones had written. " // But unlike the current movie , it focused on four girls . " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Goldwyn said . " It was flawed . It was difficult to understand how the rich girl came to relate to these other girls . Each of the girls is struggling with what ' s going to become of her . " Jojo ( Lili Taylor ) can ' t bring herself to commit to marriage . Kat ( Annabeth Gish ) , who ' s about to fall in love for the first time - with a married man - is outward bound from Mystic for an education at Yale ; and her sexy sister Daisy ( Julia Roberts ) is a source of worry after she falls for a wealthy preppy . " I got the notion of turning the spoiled rich girl into a spoiled rich boy , " Mr. Goldwyn said. // " I ' m intrigued with the idea of picking up the girls and their lives five years from now , " Mr. Goldwyn said . He noted that in 1966 " The Group , " directed by Sidney Lumet and based on the Mary McCarthy novel of the same title , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a single movie . " I feel there ' s too much story to try to do that with these people , " he said. // Next time out , as Mr. Goldwyn sees it , Jojo would be five years into marriage . Kat would have finished college and be in graduate school . And , he said , " Daisy has probably left Mystic and had a little bit of life in the fast lane. " // At this point , he said , the writer Sarah Prejean has been working on the story of the next installment for a couple of months , but Mr. Goldwyn doesn ' t expect to know the details of the heroines ' adventures for four or five weeks. // As for the cast ' s reaction to resuming the story , he said : " They seem very interested in it . They feel as I do that they ' d like to see the script . It all starts with the script . " And , he added , if there is to be a second installment , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is make these films stand totally alone so you don ' t necessarily have to have seen the first one. " // If all goes well , he said , plans call for Donald Petrie to direct once again . Filming would begin next summer , with delivery of the next " Pizza " sometime afterward . <> <> Britons and Oscars // As samples go , try a list that includes such actors as George Arliss , Ronald Colman , Sir Alec Guinness , Rex Harrison , Lord Olivier and Paul Scofield . And such actresses as Julie Andrews , Julie Christie , Glenda Jackson , Vivien Leigh , Maggie Smith and Elizabeth Taylor . Not to mention such colleagues as Michael Caine , Sir John Gielgud , John Mills , Peggy Ashcroft , Dame Wendy Hiller and Vanessa Redgrave. // Oh , and such directors as Sir Richard Attenborough , David Lean , Carol Reed and John Schlesinger. // What they all have in common is that they are counted as British Oscar winners , and those among them who are living ( 149 in all ) have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Henry VIII at Hampton Court Palace , outside London . That night , the British Academy of Film and Television Arts is planning a dinner in recognition of the 60th anniversary of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ; and invitations have gone out , too , to Richard Kahn , the organization ' s president , and to other officers. // Peter Ustinov , a winner in the supporting-actor category for " Spartacus " ( 1960 ) and " Topkapi " ( 1964 ) , will serve as host , and the festivites will be the subject of of " The British and the Oscars , " a Granada television program to be broadcast on Britain ' s ITV network on Dec. 29 . Judy Tarlo , a spokeswoman for the British Academy , said that although there were no current arrangements , broadcast in the United States would be " inevitable . " <> <> The World of Dance // When it comes to busy people , any international roster should carry the name of Charles Dance , the British actor who has starred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island " and " White Mischief , " and since then in the television romance " Out of the Shadows " and in a two-part BBC dramatization of a book called " First Born , " in which he plays a genetic engineer who produces a hybrid human-gorilla. // Mr. Dance whose credits also include the motion picture " Plenty " and an acclaimed television series , " The Jewel in the Crown , " says that when it comes to a choice among movies , theater and television , he ranks television last . " Because it demands very little from its audience , " he said . " It sits there in a corner . It ' s a sort of entertainment machine . Occasionally , when I get a project like ' The Jewel in the Crown , ' it compels an audience to watch and it enlightens them at the same time as entertaining them , where so often television is used by the audience and by the makers of television as a means of relieving boredom. " // " Most films , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises . What one strives for is something that combines the two , which is something that ' s terribly difficult. " // When it comes to choosing his projects , what Mr. Dance looks for is " first and foremost a good script - and they ' re few and far between , " he declared as he contemplated a pile of what he said were bad ones . " I ' m looking for characters that are written three dimensionally and not two dimensionally . I look for characters that have flaws in them , because all of us have flaws , and I think it ' s a mistake to put unflawed characters on the screen or on the stage , because they just don ' t exist.
