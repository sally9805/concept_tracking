 | beings he did not believe in , that at most were no more than half believed in even by the people of the farthest and most isolated colonies . He had a sense of last night 's bad dream intruding into reality . At the moment the alarms came on , Domingo was standing with his daughter at one end of the long aisle that passed diametrically under the center of the domed assembly hall . Maymyo 's hand first tightened on her father 's arm , then slipped away , as if she were determined to leave him as free as possible of personal distraction . Domingo turned to look into his daughter 's dark-brown eyes , at her lovely face framed in the pure white of unfamiliar ceremonial lace . She was gazing back at him trustfully . Her expression said that her father was still her first source of guidance on any problem , on how to deal with a wedding or an attack alarm . Or , as now , both at the same time . At least the flashing lights around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm of the shrieking kind that would have proclaimed the imminence of a berserker attack upon the colony of Shubra . Instead the signal was the comparatively less terrible one of a simple orange alert ; still , there was no choice about responding to it , and no option for even the smallest delay in doing so . No option . Yet , for a long moment in the huge room , no one had moved . Domingo and his daughter were standing together in the rear of the biggest indoor space available for human gatherings on the colonized planetoid called Shubra , satellite of a sun that had never been seen from Earth . Thirty meters away from where father and daughter stood , at the front end of the long aisle , the clergy and the witnesses were waiting . And of course the groom was up there too , Gujar Sidoruk looking even bigger and bulkier than ever in his formal citizen 's robes . Gujar was gazing back at his bride-to-be and at her father as if he , independent young man that he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . That first moment of the alarm seemed to be protracted  | endlessly . It was as if the warning had already sounded for a long time , but these people , having committed themselves to a wedding , could not quite make up their minds to respond to it . Before the long moment was over , most of the roomful of people were looking at Niles Domingo , too . Nine tenths of the population of the colonized planetoid , some two hundred people , were assembled in this hall today . With them were twenty or thirty visiting neighbors , people from other small inhabited rocks within the Milkpail Nebula . A handful of the neighbors lived virtually next door , on Shubra 's unnamed moon , but the others had traveled up to a full day to get here , astrogating their way half a billion kilometers through nebular space . Occupying almost as much floor space in the huge room as the people did was a small forest of plant life , some of the forest 's individual components towering over the humans ' heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and elsewhere , had been augmented for today 's occasion by extra greenery and a million flowers joyously freighted in from another colony , Yirrkala . On Shubra , as on most of the other small colonized rocks that revolved around certain suns within the Milkpail Nebula , outdoor ceremonies were rarely practical . The great domed room brought the assembly as close to the out-of-doors as was feasible . Overhead a clear hemisphere of force and crystal held back the whiteness and the sunset clouds of the long winter night , really astronomically distant folds of the nebula that here made up the entirety of sky and space . In only a standard year and a half it would be spring on this portion of the slow-orbiting planetoid 's surface . The night outside was one of atmospheric snow as well as nebular display ; the artificial gravity imposed by the colonists upon their rock attracted  --  among other things  --  gasses enough to form an atmosphere from this peculiar sky . Last night a terrible vision , concerning things from the sky , had come to Domingo during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous father 's dream . A natural phenomenon  | and , he supposed , common enough , especially on the eve of a daughter 's wedding . But this was real . " Alert stations , everyone ! " Domingo called out in a firm loud voice , as the audio warning paused . It had to pause , or voice communication would have been impossible . The alarm had killed all other sounds ; in the sudden tomblike silence of the huge room the mayor 's order sounded like a shout . The pause brought on by momentary shock was over . The illusion that there had been any real hesitation about responding to the alarm dissolved . Even before the last word of the mayor 's order had sounded through the room , most of the adults present were scrambling for the exits . People went running in every direction , to reach their variously scattered alert stations . The score and more of guests who had come to the wedding from nearby colonies were as accustomed to alerts as were the citizens of Shubra . The visitors knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had brought them here . When the sound of the alarm came back , it was at a more moderate level ; people once alerted had to be allowed to think and talk . Giving his daughter 's hand one last squeeze , Domingo dropped it and set off at a loping run . He knew  --  as firmly as a man could know anything  --  that he would be speaking to Maymyo again within moments , as soon as he had discovered the reason for this damned alarm . Certainly he ought to have at least one more chance to speak to her again before he had to launch a ship . Running through the familiar corridors of his own small world , first aboveground and then below , Domingo pulled off the formal citizen 's robe that custom had required him to put on over his ordinary garments at his daughter 's wedding , and bundled it under his arm . He would stuff the garment away somewhere in his ship when he got there , but for the moment it had already been forgotten . He intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause .  | In the small confines of the settlement , neither he nor anyone else had far to go to reach their posts . The tunnel flashed by him with the speed of his pounding legs . His eyes were fixed ahead , in the direction of the operations deck of the spaceport . He allowed only one thought that was in any sense a distraction to intrude itself upon him as he ran : The gods help someone , whoever did it , if this turns out to be a joke . . . such a thing , he supposed , was remotely possible . Rough humor was still popular out here on the frontier , especially in connection with weddings . Or it could be a simple false alarm , some flaw in human guardian or in equipment , though both types of trouble were uncommon . It was certainly not an ordinary practice drill ; no one would or could have called one at this time , at the instant the mayor 's daughter 's wedding was about to start . The cause of the alarm would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no one , no colonist anywhere in the Milkpail Nebula , ever failed to take such an alarm seriously or delayed in reacting to it . Everyone who lived in the Milkpail knew , with more than intellectual awareness , what berserkers were . Still moving at a run , among other men and women still running with him , Domingo entered the great rocky cave of the space harbor . Here too were the orange lights , the pulsating throb of the alarm . In a few moments more the mayor had reached the interior dock where the Sirian Pearl was drifting gently , waiting for him . His new ship was a smooth volume of metal , more a flattened ovoid than a sphere , its overall size a trifle greater than that of the huge crystal room he had just left . Still , the ship was small inside the enormous carved-out cave chamber of the port . Like some of the other more advanced craft nearby , his new ship had reacted automatically to the alarm by altering its own gravitic balance enough to rise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pearl , pearlcolored in the brilliant lights around it , its silent spacewarping engines barely energized , was keeping station now  | about a meter above the deck . Domingo knew that his ship 's computer would already be counting itself down through the preliminary prelaunch checklist . It would wait for human orders before it went beyond the prelaunch phase . The mayor was not a large man , but he was strong and active . He swung himself up and into his ship through the waiting hatchway . Moments later he was throwing himself into his command chair in the center of the ship . The command chair was centered in a small hollow space whose inner surface was all pads , displays , controls . The space was physically isolated from the other crew stations , as they were from one another . In it there might have been room for two people to stand beside the single chair . The cushioned , built-in command seat closed its panels and pads around him as he sat down , making a snug fit . The manual controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in odd emergencies . He reached for a brown circlet of what looked like cloth that was attached to his seat by a slender cord . By pulling the band caplike onto his head , he fitted himself to his headlink , through which he interacted with the ship . The ship was now attuned to certain components of the electrical activity of his brain . Now , essentially by ordered thought , almost as if by telepathy , Domingo could exert direct control over all shipboard systems . He began immediately , turning on , without physical motion , several of the viewing devices in front of him . One of these presented him with the holographic image of the head and shoulders of a middle-aged man named Strozzi . Strozzi , the colony 's current duty officer , was now standing somewhere in the Defense Center , deep underground with a wall of deep gray rock showing behind him . " Report ! " Domingo snapped . Strozzi quickly gave assurances to the mayor  --  and to the hundred or so other people who by now were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer hastened to add that  | the danger to Shubra did not appear to be immediate ; he would have called a red alert for that . " What , then ? " " A robot courier arrived here about five minutes ago from Liaoning . " That was another colonized planetoid of the same sun , some twelve hours away at the current orbital positions of both bodies . " The message is that they 're under berserker attack there , and they want immediate assistance . " " Attackers ' strength ? " " One unit only . But they say it 's overwhelming their defenses . " Domingo swore again , once more blaspheming the names of ancient and almost forgotten gods and demigods . " Let me guess . " The duty officer relaxed from the formal posture he had been holding , as if managing any prolonged dialogue that way were too much of a strain . " Guess if you want . They think that it 's Leviathan . " When the name was spoken , others among the people listening swore . Domingo scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make plans . Strozzi went on methodically with his report . He already had the Shubran ground defense system 's radio receivers scanning the communications spectrum for more word from Liaoning , but there was nothing coming in . That was not necessarily significant . Between worlds such a distance apart in nebular space , it was usually more surprising when radio communications were open than when they failed . Hence the reliance by everyone in the Milkpail on swift , small robotic courier ships for quick , dependable communication across all but the smallest interplanetary gulfs . Strozzi also reported that he had already dispatched a Shubran robot courier to the Space Force at Base Four Twentyfive . The duty officer had programmed it to pass on word of the reported attack and had added the information that Shubra planned to respond to the call for help . Their response would probably be taken for granted anyway .  | " Very good , " Domingo said and began to issue orders . " Put our ground defenses on red alert , Strozzi . But cancel the extra alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , sir . " The duty officer looked away , his hands doing something offstage . " Red alert is now in effect . " Domingo looked at another display inside his armored nest . " All Shubran defense ships prepare to launch , and report to me as soon as you 're ready . We 're going to relieve Liaoning . Visitor ships , check in with me . " Now the mayor-commander divided his own personal communications display . In one sector before him the faces of visitors appeared , beginning to report as ordered from their own ships . There was Spence Benkovic , organizer of a tiny private colony on a moon of Shubra . There was Elena Mossuril , the leader of the delegation from da Gama , a large planetoid of a different sun . Here came the Mounana people . Someone else , and someone else again , from different planetoids and moons , from very minor and comparatively major colonies , all of them within a day 's space travel from Shubra . The visitors could have elected to remain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to add the firepower of their ships to the relief expedition to Liaoning . But , as Domingo had expected , all of them chose to depart , to carry warning to their own homes . He , in their place , would have done the same thing . All were quickly cleared for launching . " My own crew , check in . " The lifelike images of their familiar faces appeared one by one on the holographic stage in front of the captain . The stage was again split , leaving room for the simultaneous display of other information , in particular the checklist display showing how far each one of the Shubran ships was from readiness to launch . Even as Domingo 's own crew members reported in , they were already wearing their headlinks , busy running the Sirian Pearl 's various systems up to speed . " Chakuchin here . " The stage showed optimistic features  | framed in blond hair and beard , the face of a large and solidly built young man . " Poinsot aboard . " Henric Poinsot was a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time more crisp and businesslike . " I 'm here , Niles . " That was Apollina Suslova , a compactly built , attractive young woman , wide-eyed as usual , her wild-tossed hair giving an erroneous impression of disorganization . Like most of the other crew members she had on a mixture of wedding-guest finery and hastily added shipboard gear and clothing . " Iskander in . " This was an old friend of Domingo 's , deep-voiced , calm and almost leisurely ; his black hair and brows were bold-looking to match the rest of his angular face . Iskander Baza was reclining in his acceleration couch with his broad shoulders turned at an angle . As usual at the beginning of action , he gave the impression that he was not taking any of these matters of routine preparation too seriously , but he was ready to enjoy what was going to follow . " Wilma checking in . I was aboard before you were , Niles . " Then the pretty red-haired wife of Simeon Chakuchin corrected herself in this formal situation . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ship was ready . And the other crews and ships that made up the rest of his little squadron were ready too , or nearly so . And still the final warning of imminent attack had not been sounded . Neither Strozzi , Maymyo , nor any of the many other people assigned to Ground Defense , probing with their subtle instruments , had yet been able to discover any information indicating that there was any direct berserker threat to Shubra . Nor was there any further word on what might be happening or had already happened at Liaoning . The powerful detector fields of Ground Defense were ranging out as far as they could into white nebula . But there were no berserkers in sight as yet on the immediate approaches to Shubra . Beyond a few hundred thousand kilometers it was  | impossible to see ; the nebula as always offered cover for potential attacker and victim alike . One ship after another of the mayor 's irregular squadron reported ready to launch , but Domingo held back from ordering a launch . He wanted to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before departure , to talk once more to his daughter . He got through to her defensive post , which was one of the riskier , isolated positions near the surface . Again Maymyo 's image appeared before him ; this time Domingo had a moment to consider what she looked like . His conclusion was that she looked very businesslike , in spite of everything . Though she was still in her wedding gown , the lace that minutes ago had crowned her dark hair had been replaced by a headlink band . Her father could see the white collar of the dress inside the space armor that regulations prescribed for defenders near the surface . And behind his daughter he could see part of the interior of the little dugout of hardened rock and metal , and some of the panels and readouts there much like those in his ship . He said to her , softly and quickly : " This will still be your day , sweetheart . Or tomorrow will . We 'll get things organized again . " " I 'm not worried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best that could be expected under the circumstances . They exchanged smiles . Domingo added : " Your mother would have been ... " Maymyo smiled . " What , Dad ? " " Nothing . " What had he been about to say ? Proud of you ? Isabel would have been terrified , and had been , close to the point of helplessness , on several occasions . Not really made for this kind of life . But Maymyo was tougher . " She would have been all right . You will , too . " His daughter nodded bravely . A moment later , with all available ships reporting readiness to launch , Domingo gave the order that took them all in rapid succession , in silent , unspectacular , efficient move- ment , out of their docks and harbor and up into low defensive orbit . The small ships , with their crews cushioned from acceleration by interior fields , needed only a very few seconds to do that ; the outside gravitational gradient , strongly augmented as it was by buried generators , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , below , looked small  --  as indeed it was , no more than about two hundred kilometers in diameter . It also looked very white , swathed in a snowy rag of atmosphere accumulated over the years of artificial gravity . On the side of the long Shubran day , surface collector grids and harvester machines were working , gathering and sorting through the steady infall of primitive nebular life forms . The crop would be sifted for the desired exotic chemicals , some of which would be processed for shipment to distant worlds . Some . of the largest collecting and harvesting machines were barely visible at this altitude . No other planetary bodies , no suns or stars , were directly visible anywhere . The white , giant sun of Shubra that indirectly , through reradiation in the nebula , nourished several colonies was perceptible by a general whitening and brightening , in one direction only , of the eternal pale pastels of the interplanetary mist . In this whitespace region  --  another name for the interior of the nebula  --  it was common for small planets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one day or one year to the next . Large planets had no time to develop life of their own , or even favorable conditions for it , and tended to be uninhabitable for Earth-descended people . Within the Milkpail such worlds existed only very briefly , in terms of astronomical or evolutionary time . The planetary bodies here , like many outside the nebula , were produced from the occasional exploding suns . In the thicker parts of the nebula , as around Shubra , light pressure from most types of suns was inadequate to produce a stable clear space in which planetary orbits could be stable and long-lasting . Relatively thick nebular material encroaching on a solar system , as it did here , tended to wear out the plane- tary orbits rapidly , particularly those of larger bodies . Those were broken apart by tidal forces when the friction of the medium through which they traveled had sufficiently constricted their orbits . Worlds as big as Earth , or even Venus , lasted no more than a few million years at most from the time when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering so drastically with orbital mechanics , it was not unheard of for a small planet within the Milkpail to switch suns , effecting a sudden change in allegiance after a few hundred thousand standard years of orbital loyalty . The portion of the Milkpail Nebula immediately surrounding Shubra offered good screening for a sneak attacker and thus contributed to the danger ; but in another way the nebula was an aid to the defenders . An attacking force had a hard time trying to scout out the defenses of a world , just as the defenders found it difficult to observe an enemy 's approach . Now , via tight-beam communications , a discussion began among the captains of the orbiting ships as to how the situation might have developed since the courier was sent from Liaoning . There was some debate among crews and spacecraft commanders as to how best to respond to the cry for rescue , whether to approach Liaoning from two sides or in one small squadron . People voiced their views openly , the mayor making no effort as yet to squelch dissent . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least was their right . When they had finished talking , he would tell them : We stay in one squadron . He was in charge , and everyone knew it , but still he could expect nothing like the discipline of a Space Force fleet . There were moments  --  no more than that  --  when he would have been glad to have it . Poinsot suggested : " We could split up , come in from different directions at slightly different times . They said there was only one unit attacking . " Domingo spoke sharply . " They said maybe it was Old Blue . We stay together . " " What 's all this Old Blue ? I thought someone said Levia- than , whatever that is . I did n't get that , either . " The speaker this time was Chakuchin , a comparative newcomer to the Milkpail . " It 's a particular berserker , " said Domingo , and fell silent , sighing faintly . Chakuchin , who had fought berserkers before , outside the Milkpail , paused , trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? And I thought they could n't get any of their really big units into the nebula . " That was not strictly true ; a machine or ship of any size could be brought in among the tenuous clouds of interstellar matter and eventually manage to make its way around and through them . But any vessel or machine above a certain size , perhaps twice the cross-section of the Sirian Pearl , would be unable to move through those clouds at a speed great enough to allow for effective action . Iskander took a try at explaining . " Leviathan is a special berserker . It has three or four names , actually . Some call it Old Blue , some something else . " " Why special ? " " Partly because it 's a damned tough one . Weapons from one end to the other . And it has a way of coming up with something new . " " Huh . " " And partly because it behaves erratically . Even for a berserker . It 's been around the Sector for generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . " Iskander 's sardonic voice made it sound as if he might be making up grim jokes . Simeon , sounding not all that much enlightened or impressed , muttered something vague . Domingo , listening in on the conversation , could hardly blame him . Few people , thank all the gods and godlings , had Domingo 's own experience or anything like it . You had to at least have lived here for a few years , on one or more of the colonies , to understand . . . His own thoughts returned to more current problems . He could not rid his mind of the people he was leaving behind , the abandoned ceremony . And Maymyo in particular , spend- ing her wedding day at her battle station , virtually alone . But there was a job to be done , and quickly . Once more he issued orders . Now the little squadron led by the Sirian Pearl moved into a higher orbit . And now it quickly left the small globe of Shubra behind , hurrying to a neighbor 's aid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what type , would be on the way to Liaoning from the other colonies . Probably Liaoning had tried to dispatch couriers to some of them , too , but he could not assume that those messengers had ever reached their destinations or that more help would be forthcoming . If it was coming , it might of course arrive too late . But whether it was much or little , in time or too late , his own duty and that of his fellow citizens was clear . Leviathan . He put down  --  tried to put down  --  old personal memories and feelings . He had to look at this as a military strategist , a logical commander . It would be something , it would really be an achievement , if they could surround the damned thing in space with this many fighters and settle a lot of old scores for a lot of colonies and ships . " Maybe we 'll get out of the milk a little way , have a chance to see a few real stars . " That again was from Chakuchin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Domingo had been here in the Milkpail for twenty years , with only occasional peeks outside . By now he 'd almost forgotten what stars out in clear space looked like . The little ships had built up speed . The folded whiteness of the Milkpail was passing over and under and around them continually , almost like atmospheric clouds flowing under and around a speeding aircraft , gatherings of whiteness and subtle color flickering with the velocity of their passage . Lungs trying to breathe this stuff would labor vainly , on what to Earthly life was no more than a good vacuum . But when  | the brightness was seen millions of kilometers deep , it looked thick and practically opaque . " Something out there to our right , Captain . " " I have it . Thank you . " Even as the crew watched on their individual viewing devices , the three-o'clock detectors confirmed that something moved out there to starboard , something that was independent of the inanimate currents and surges that worked perpetually within the nebula itself . Life of a kind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shoal perhaps of microscopic bodies , half matter and half force . Life throve here in the nebula , in themes that were unknown anywhere else in the modest portion of the Galaxy that had been visited by Earth-descended folk . It flourished , unbreathing life in wide variety growing in the light gravity , mild pressure and plentiful energy that obtained here . Something out there absorbed energy , ingested material food  --  that same gas , far too thin to sustain a human breath or insect 's wing  --  metabolized , and lived . It might be one of the more or less familiar nebular life forms , the types that were harvested on and near the surface of Shubra and the other active colonies . It might be something not yet encountered by the colonists ; right now it was too far off for Domingo to be able to tell , and he had no time to stop and look . " Damn , but this is a peculiar place ! " Chakuchin said it with admiration , with the pride of a new but authentic resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sirian Pearl could be driven by the agile thought of one skilled pilot working alone . But the ship served its human masters most precisely and reliably when it was operated by a crew of six , who could divide its several functions efficiently among them . The five crew stations other than the pilot 's , all separated in different parts of the ship , were now filled with Domingo 's friends and fellow colonists . He congratulated himself , as the voyage of the relief force got under way , that days ago , even with wedding preparations and mayoral duties competing for his attention , he had made himself take time over the final selection of the crew for his new ship and for a couple of test-and-training flights . Domingo himself now held the helm . He was sitting in his armored chamber near the center of the ship , still wearing some of the good clothes he had put on for his daughter 's wedding . On his forehead rested the spacecraft commander 's  | mindlink control band ; it was a physically light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heavy as any crown . Without moving a finger or even blinking an eyelid , the captain personally held the Pearl on what he considered her best course for Liaoning  --  close to , but not identical with , the best course as simultaneously calculated by the ship 's computer . He still considered the human brain , particularly his own , superior to hardware at the most difficult parts of the incredibly complex task . There was some feedback from the equipment to the optic centers of the brain , making the control a partly visual process , trickily akin to imagination ? inexperienced pilots often got into trouble imagining that there was no difference . The autopilot , teamed with the ship 's computer , might have managed to conduct the flight just as well  --  or almost as well  --  as he could , but right now the captain preferred to drive his new ship himself . The Pearl boasted new engines and improved protective fields  --  at this speed inside the nebula you needed protection against collisions with mere molecules , there were so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five other ships in his small squadron , but he did not . Urgent as was the need for speed , he calculated that it was a still more urgent need that his force stay together in the face of a certainly formidable and possibly superior enemy . Leviathan . The captain had a personal score to settle with that particular legendary foe  --  whether or not it made sense to feel a personal enmity toward a machine . But he could n't be certain that he was going to encounter Leviathan this time . All he could really be sure of was that he was leading his people against berserkers . The berserkers were robotic relics of some interstellar war that had been fought long before the beginning of written history on Earth . They were , in their prime form , vast inanimate spacegoing fortresses , moving lifelessly across the Galaxy in obedience to their fundamental programming command that all the life they could find must be destroyed . In all the  | centuries of expansion of Earth-descended humanity among the stars , berserkers were by far the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically , Domingo could have called up on any of several screens or stages the image of whitespace whipping by outside . But after making the checklist test of that function shortly after launching , he forebore to use it . Instead , during the first hour of the flight , Domingo called up human faces , those of his fellow colonists aboard the other ships , coming and going on his screens and stages . In this way he held conversation fairly steadily with the other units of the relief squadron . There were five other ships in all , including the craft commanded by Gujar Sidoruk , and Niles Domingo , as commander of the relief force , wanted to make sure that when the combat zone was reached they would all continue to follow his orders . That willingness established to his satisfaction , as well as it could be before the fact , he ordered intership conversation to be broken off and imposed complete radio silence . Desultory intercom conversation continued aboard the Sirian Pearl . There was no reason why it should not . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people they knew on Liaoning , and speculated on the strength of the berserker force attacking there . It was possible that the report of only one berserker was outdated , that more attackers had come in later , after the courier was sent . If the enemy force at the scene proved to be overwhelming , the relief squadron would have to turn and run for home again  --  if it was still able to do even that much . Everyone understood that , but no one mentioned it . Domingo took little part in the rambling intercom chatter , but he listened to it with more than half an ear even while his mind went its own way , watching the instruments before him and trying to make plans . As it was with the captains of the other ships , so it was even with his own crew : He knew some of them better than he knew others . The population of Shubra was small , but it was far from stable . People moved on- and  | Affworld frequently . Some of the present population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterans and some were not . Domingo , who certainly had earned that status . wanted to monitor the nerve , and assess the probable behavior under pressure , of those who had not . It would have been an excellent thing , of course , to have the Pearl manned by an all-veteran , picked crew ; but in this militia organization , rank had no such privilege . The available pool of experience had to be shared out among all the crews . The veterans on the Pearl , besides Domingo himself , included Iskander Baza , Wilma Chanar and Henric Poinsot . That left two rookies on the team . Apollina Suslova had not been many months on Shubra and was really still a citizen of Yirrkala . On being assigned to Domingo 's crew  --  every capable adult had an alert station ramrewhere  --  she had told him that she had been briefly under bombardment at least once , on yet another colony , but she had never known the strain of helping to control a ship in battle . Domingo suspected she was becoming attracted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it should turn out that way , though , he 'd have to get her off his combat crew . In his experience the two kinds of relationship did n't mix . A married couple aboard ought to be different . He hoped so , at least . Not that he himself had any intention of getting married again . Simeon Chakuchin , unlike his wife Wilma Chanar , was a comparatively new settler , but all indications were that he was psychologically strong and capable . Not everybody who reached the frontier colonies fit those criteria , though you 'd think they might . The captain 's meditations were interrupted by the voice of Iskander Baza on intercom : " I 've got Liaoning on the detectors , Cap . Still at extreme range . " The captain switched one of his own display stages to take the forward detectors ' signal . Even to his trained perception ,  | the solid-looking image was no more than a vague mottled blur . The planetoid that was the destination of the relief force was in an orbit not greatly different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow orbits around the same almosthidden sun , a giant of a radiation source . Its fierceness , dulled by intervening clouds , still turned the atmospheres of its inhabited planetoids , as well as much of nearby space , into a white veil of sometimes glaring brightness . The nebula not only made interplanetary observation difficult , but it rendered the faster modes of space travel totally unattainable within itself . There was no possibility that human ship or berserker machine could ever achieve effective faster-than-light velocity through these vast , attenuated clouds dl'i of matter . Therefore all of the colonized planetoids were separated by long hours or days of travel time , as if they had been light-years apart in more ordinary space . Now , to Domingo and the others watching their own progress as charted by their onboard computers on holographic models of the intervening nebula , their best attainable motion was a painful crawl . But eventually , long hours after the relief mission had begun and minutes after Baza 's first claimed sighting of their goal , the computer-enhanced image of Liaoning ahead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The image was becoming just a little clearer , something marginally better than a blur . Domingo ordered : " Cut the chatter , everyone . To stations . We 're getting near . " III With all six ships on full alert , the small relief squadron at last prowled within clear instrument range of its goal . The nearly spherical ball of Liaoning , slightly prolate , showed ! I more and more clearly against the ubiquitous milky background . Still the instruments revealed no sign of the attacking enemy . " Tight beam , Wilma . Tell them we 're here . " The message went out on radio , aimed precisely at the  | planetoid ahead ; no receiver anywhere else should be able to ick it up . The seconds passed that should have brought an answer , ut they did not . And then at last the Pearl was close nough to see the settlements on Liaoning 's surface . To see , rather , the places on the surface where those ttlements had been . Domingo 's crew , and those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a scene of total devastation . Not a building had been left standing , not a settlement was still recognizable . They hurtled closer . Questioning radio beams probed the scorched-looking land below . Still there was no response of any kind . No sign that any berserker still lurked in the area or that the death machines might have been inefficient enough to leave anything still alive behind them when they departed . The marks of the terrible enemy weapons became plainer and plainer on the surface below , as the Pearl drew nearer and nearer to the planetoid . There appeared to be no survivors . Hours ago , Domingo had silently made plans for what ought to be done in this worst case . He implemented those plans now , issuing terse orders . There was a small spacegoing launch aboard the Pearl , and he selected three of his crew members to go down to the surface of Liaoning in the launch and directly investigate the death and ruin at close range . The captain himself remained where he was , at the helm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member detailed to go down . Polly Suslova , who the captain thought could use the experience , was second . Henric Poinsot , steady and reliable , was the third of the crew to be chosen . When the launch ejected itself from his ship , Domingo could feel nothing through the Pearl 's metal frame or through the field of artificial gravity maintained within the ship , a field usually set , like that of their home planetoid , at Earth normal strength . But he could see , on the stages and  | screens in front of him , how the long , narrow shape of the smaller vessel dwindled rapidly away toward the scorched surface of the planetoid . Minutes passed , minutes that brought an almost continuous stream of progress reports from the swiftly receding launch below . The relayed observations added little but detail to the honor already known . So far there was no sign of any survivor out of the hundreds of colonists who had lived here . Now , with Domingo 's permission , other ships in the relief squadron sent down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blasted surface . The launches landed , one after another , at separated sites . The first reports direct from the surface confirmed the catastrophe . One crew reported finding a small wrecked berserker unit , an automated lander  --  ground defense here had not been totally ineffective . At last one of the searchers picked up a faint tone from a survival radio . In less than an hour the launch crews were able to uncover first one human survivor and then another from isolated hideouts . Briefly the rescuers ' hopes rose . But that was all . No more people were found alive . The two survivors were brought up into space and taken aboard one of the other ships of the relief squadron . Then Domingo , while his own crew and others listened in , questioned them on tightbeam communications . He spoke with special gentleness to one of the two , a young girl . In his mind he kept seeing Maymyo in her place . Both of the people who had been recovered alive were injured , and both of them had tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated , in deep separate shelters . They were numbed and shaken by what they had been through . They murmured disjointedly of incredible dangers , of being stalked and bombarded by death , and of miraculous escape . Domingo asked : " How many of them were there ? How many berserkers ? I do n't mean landers . How many of the big machines in space ? "  | One of the survivors had no idea . The other had heard a report that there had been but a single enemy . " Leviathan ? Old Blue ? " " I do n't know . Somebody said that it was . . . that one . People always say it 's that , when there 's only one . . . I do n't know . " A medical person who was on the ship with the survivors and trying to treat them now intervened . The captain ought to cut his questioning as short as possible . The patients were both in a bad way , with shock and other problems . " 1 ' 11 keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy go from here ? Have you any clue as to that ? " But the survivors , not surprisingly , were able to offer their rescuers no clue . Neither of the stunned humans had seen the enemy approaching their world or attacking it , even on instruments , much less observed its departure . The captain let them go . How had the defenses of Liaoning been overwhelmed so quickly ? The two numbed , quivering humans had been able to give him no information on that point . The recording devices that were supposed to register combat action might tell the story , but the indications were that none of the ground stations containing those recording devices had survived . Domingo now ordered his own shipboard instruments turned away from the planetoid , and with them his crew diligently scanned the thin surrounding clouds of white emission and reflection nebula . In the clouds the instruments could find disturbances that told of the recent passage of sizable objects moving at high sublight velocity , as fast as was prudent and maybe a little faster for something that big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nebular fog that was thin enough to count as a fair vacuum . Had there really been only one of the enemy , or more ? The disturbances were too fragmentary to tell . And the scanners and computers could find no dependable indication of which way the tracks were leading . A clamor began to reach the commander from people on the other five ships . Each colonist in the rescue squadron had  | begun to fear that his or her own family and home on Shubra was now in greater danger than before , perhaps at this very moment already under attack . " We better get home , Chief . " " We will . We 're going home right away , do n't panic . " Then Domingo reminded them calmly  --  and some of them began reminding each other  --  that the automated defenses of Shubra were strong , stronger than those of Liaoning had been , and that they ought to hold , even without their squadron 's support , for several days , especially against attack by only a single enemy . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Liaoning had probably felt confident in their automated defenses too . Had those people been given time to get any of their own ships into space ? It was impossible to determine the answer to that one conclusively ; what had been the Liaoning space harbor , an underground facility much like Shubra 's , was now an inferno of nuclear fire . If any ships had been launched , they were nowhere to be seen . Still , the known power of the Shubran planetary home defense systems gave the people from Shubra a positive thought to cling to , something with which to reassure themselves during the return trip to their own world . That trip now began without further delay . Domingo saw to it that the two people his squadron had rescued from Liaoning were kept aboard a ship other than his own . There was one ship whose crew included a couple of people that one of the survivors knew , and the two were placed on that . He hoped it might make things a little easier for them . The captain-mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close as possible to perfect readiness for combat . Having refugees aboard would not contribute to that end and might detract from it . His new ship was the best fighter in the squadron , he was sure , even if it was still untested in battle . If the trip out from Shubra had seemed long , the journey  | hack again was endless , filled with largely silent horror and impatience . Domingo still held the squadron together , for the same reason he had done so on the journey out . When a berserker had achieved one such successful attack , another one soon , somewhere , was very likely . No one on his ship wanted to voice the common fear of what they might find on their arrival home , but neither could anyone stop thinking about it . All logic said it was unlikely . There was no reason to believe the berserker had gone from Liaoning to their world rather than somewhere else . But .. . Polly Suslova , at least , thought that she could sense a faint , silent accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His tactical gamble had failed . It was an unfair accusation , of course . There was nothing else the Shubran ships could have done , under any commander , but respond as they had responded to the urgent distress message from their neighbor colony . But the response had failed . Instead of intercepting the berserkers , saving Liaoning and putting a stop to the menace for the time being , all that had been accomplished was to save two shattered people and to weaken the defenses of their own home for more than a day . It would be bad luck indeed if the enemy were to mount a heavy attack on Shubra within that time . But the absence of bad luck could never be relied upon . And at last the trip home was almost over . " I 've got an image of home on the detectors now , Captain . Maximum range . " Good , thought Domingo . Now within thirty seconds or a minute I will get a further detector report , observation of some surface features , some activity , the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably not be any open radio transmissions to pick up . A red alert , which meant radio silence , had been in effect here since the squadron 's departure . Those conditions could soon be relaxed somewhat . There was a wedding to carry on with , however Maymyo and Gujar wanted to do it . Any celebration today or tomor- row would have to be severely restricted . It was going to be a while at best before the alert could be canceled completely . Until communications were exchanged with the Base . Until .. . The thirty seconds had passed , and then thirty more , and the silence on all the instruments was beginning to grow ominous . The visuals were getting clear enough to see now , to allow recognition of something of the familiar surface , anyway . . . but still only ambiguous spots were coming through . There was so much surface cloud , ice crystals blowing ... Two seconds later he . had to admit it to himself . The surface of Shubra ought not to look like that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , could not be , totally silent at this close range . They could not be , unless the unthinkable should intrude here and now into the actual . And that could not be happening . No , not that . Unless .. . There was no single moment in which the terror became reality . Rather there were minutes in which the members of the relief expedition slowly found their worst fears realized . There was now ruin on Shubra , almost the equal of that they had left behind them on Liaoning . There were spontaneous outcries from the people aboard the Pearl , and then stunned silence . The silence did not last long ; there followed frantic efforts to communicate with someone , anyone , below . The attempts were as futile as they were desperate . Still there might be , might be , survivors . The rush to investigate was frenzied . This time Domingo landed the ship , crudely and clumsily ; he put the Sirian Pearl down directly on the surface , because here , just as on Liaoning , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping wound whose jagged mouth resembled that of a volcano . The deep center of Defense Control had to be gone , too ; it could not have survived that cavitation . As Domingo landed his ship , the other ships of his squad- ron were coming down as well , landing on the surface close around the Pearl . The crews all disembarked and then milled around beside their ships , looking for some kind of hope , some indication of human survival . But it was a strange and unfamiliar world on which they stood . protected by their suits and helmets of space armor . The rocks of it still roared and shuddered underfoot . Every building had been wiped away . The atmosphere was poisoned . Fresh snow and black smoke blew together across a cratered , shattered , alien landscape . The artificial gravity was weakening already . The deeply buried generators that created it had doubtless been damaged , and soon the smoke and the snow would be gone , along with all the air .. . Domingo was commander still , and still mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first minutes giving orders , trying to prevent the disintegration of his crew and the other crews , instead of running in a frenzy to see what had happened to his daughter . An organized search for survivors was begun . It was only minutes after the search started when the personal news reached him : The bride-to-be , his daughter , along with all her comrades in Defense , was dead . Duty forgotten , Domingo commandeered the only ground vehicle available  --  it had come down aboard one of his squadron 's ships  --  and rushed to the scene . Maymyo 's small defense position had been as well protected as any of the other posts near the surface . The only access to the position from the surface was through a bankvault door set under the overhanging brow of a hardrock cliff . But her nest , like all the others , had been scorched and blasted open . The massive door hung ajar , half torn from its great hinge , the inner and outer surfaces of it alike sagging where they had begun to melt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor , ran in through the unprotected doorway . Enough light came in through it , into the small chamber of steel and hardened rock , for him to see .  | The poisoned snow was drifting in before him , with him , after him . Her body was almost completely destroyed . At least the pitiful thing , scorched flesh and bone with snow already drifting on it , was assumed to be her body , because here it was at her post ; but whoever it was was not wearing space armor , had not been wearing it at death . Chunks of the armor lay nearby , more durable than almost anything else amid the ruin . When Domingo had jumped into the groundcar and roared away without waiting for Gujar , the younger man had climbed back into his own landed ship and taken off , only to land again almost immediately here by Maymyo 's cave . Now , screaming and ranting , his duty and his crew forgotten , he came running into the gutted dugout , past Domingo , to throw himself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incoherent grief with the man who was to have been his father-in-law . Then Gujar gathered up what appeared to be the shreds of wedding gown and , moving at a staggering run , took them back into his ship . On his suit radio Domingo could hear him , muttering half coherently about some kind of positive identification test . The stricken father remained kneeling in front of the ruin of what had been a human being . All he could think was : Why no space armor ? Maymyo would not have taken her armor off in combat . So the blasted body before him was not hers after all . Anyway it was impossible that it should be hers . Another report was brought to Domingo , who somehow was still numbly functioning . On Shubra , unlike Liaoning , one of the military combat recorders , deeply embedded in the surface of the planetoid , had survived . Enough information had already been extracted from the recorder to confirm the fact of a single attacker . It had been Old Blue , Leviathan , rearmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons employed by Ground Defense .  | Leviathan . Standing now in the doorway of the ruined cave , Domingo looked up into the howling sky . Overhead another ship , a small one , was approaching the surface , coming down to a gentle landing beside the six that had already landed , following their squadron commander . Presently the newcomer 's markings could be identified . It carried one of the wedding guests returning . The small ship landed quietly only fifty or sixty meters away from the cave , and its owner got out of it , alone , and approached the little crowd now gathered around Domingo . The new arrival was Spence Benkovic , who had his own small colony on the only moon of Shubra . Benkovic was a lean , dark-bearded , youngish man . He had a handsome face and large , expressive eyes . Staring without comment at the small shattered shelter , the covered body , he gave what news he could to the stunned people standing around him . " When the alarm went off , I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numbed voice . " All I 've got is that little one-seat battler : Not real good for a real fight ? hut I thought I 'd see what I could see . " A couple of hours later , he reported , he had been patrolling out at maximum t detector range , several hundred thousand kilometers from Shubra , hoping to be able to observe any approaching berserkers in time to give warning to the world of the enemy 's approach . " I should have let you know what I was doing , I guess ... " No one commented ; there was no reason to think it would have made any difference . " Then I thought I saw something , moving in the nebula . Too fast to be just a shoal of life . But it was n't a berserker , either . " " What , then ? " someone was curious enough to ask . " A drift , maybe . " After shoals , drifts were the most common kind of formation in which the local primitive life forms tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " But  --  so fast . And then I thought  | that on the detectors it looked like some kind of spacecraft ? one ship , or two close together . I do n't know whose ship it would have been . But it was n't berserkers , either , not then , because whatever it was did n't come on to attack . " " Berserkers just scouting ? Small units . " " Maybe . " Benkovic did n't sound convinced . " Then ? Leviathan must have come in on Shubra from one direction while I was off scouting in the other . Did n't take it any time at all to take out the ground stations ; it could n't have taken any time , because in a matter of minutes I was back , close enough to see what was happening . Then . . . I could see it dropping small units right here . . . in this area of the surface . " Domingo raised his head . It was as if he were really seeing Benkovic for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Yeah . I saw 01 ' Blue once before , a long time ago . I 've been in a fight or two . . . . It put its little units ; i down , right here , directly on the surface , or hovering over it so close as makes no difference . . . there was nothing I could do . I did n't stay close enough to watch . My little battler , hell , there was nothing . . . I went back to my moon , 11 to try to get my own people out . But it had already been there , too . " MIiii After a little pause , someone asked : " Who was up there on the moon besides you ? I never heard , exactly . " " Three people . Three women . Only one 's still alive . Then I tried to broadcast a warning , but the whole area , the planet and moon and everything , was under some kind of jamming . " Then when I took off and looked around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me somehow , coming and going . And there was  --  this . " Benkovic made an expressive , sweeping gesture encompassing the dead landscape around them . Domingo turned away from him , looking in another direction . Gujar , still moving like a sleepwalker , was coming back from his own ship . There were still scraps of white material I , in his hands . In an alien-sounding voice the bridegroom said that he had made a final identification of the wedding gown fragment as Maymyo 's . There could be no mistake . There  | had been exotic fibers woven into it , plant material from his own mother 's distant homeworld . Benkovic looked sick . Domingo was suddenly sitting down , on a snow-drifted rock , staring at nothing . His face inside the clear plate of his helmet was ghastly . Polly Suslova caught him as he fell .  | Polly had been married once , but her husband had moved Ilj on , leaving the two children with her . She and Karl had for the most part enjoyed each other 's company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had the feeling that she had unintentionally and in some nonphysical sense worn him out . klr , dil , ; . The only close relatives Polly now possessed in the universe , besides her two children , were a sister and brother-inlaw who were caring for those children now . At present they j  --  z ? were all four elsewhere in the Milkpail , riding another colonized rock called Yirrkala , the planetoid from which the flowers for Maymyo 's wedding had been imported . As the magnitude of the Shubran disaster became plain , as the reality of the destruction of her friends ' families and homes established itself , Polly 's thoughts were increasingly occupied not with the ruin before her eyes , but with her two children , whom she had not seen for several months . It was not so much anxiety she felt , or overt fear that Yirrkala was  | also going to be attacked . Rather she felt a vague satisfaction that she had planned the disposition of her children properly , had done a good job of seeing to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was difficult being separated from them , but Polly 's job had required her to move to Shubra for half a standard year . She was a specialist in a field that was sometimes less and sometimes more esoteric than it sounded , the relationships of machines with the environments in which they worked . The job also kept her unpredictably busy . Whenever she had thought about it rationally , even before disaster struck , there had been no doubt in her mind that the kids were currently better off with her relatives on Yirrkala . Polly had been getting along well enough with the Shubran colonists as she lived among them , but she had made no deep personal attachments on Shubra . Except , as she now had to admit to herself , for one . The destruction of the Shubran colony , devastating though it was , was the second such shock of mass tragedy to hit her in a little more than one day . It found her already somewhat numb . Empathic feelings for the grieving survivors did not strike her with overwhelming personal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing near enough to the captain , and watching him closely enough , to try to catch the inert mass of his suited body when he started to fall . In the failing artificial gravity  --  fields dying with the blasted generators under the ground  --  she was successful . Inside his faceplate Domingo looked more dead than alive ; pure shock , Polly supposed . She had got the impression that much of his life was wrapped up in his daughter . She eased him to the ground and sent someone else running to the Pearl 's landed launch for a first-aid kit . When the kit arrived , she administered a treatment for shock through one of the inlet valves thoughtfully provided in suits of space armor for such emergencies . She watched the victim 's reaction as under the chemical stimulus he began to recover . In the busy minutes immediately following , minutes largely taken up by an intense and  | futile search for more survivors , Polly stayed with Domingo as much as possible , wanting to keep him in contact with humanity if nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time she was worried for his life . The captain spoke to no one for almost an hour following his collapse . For the first few minutes he was deeply stunned , almost paralyzed . His crew gave him what modest medical care they could . After that he showed signs of awareness but remained for a considerable time in his state of silent shock . He sat on the ground speechless and essentially alone except for Polly , while around him his few surviving fellow citizens , in the intervals between their futile efforts to find other survivors , acted out their own grief and outrage in various ways . The next stage of Domingo 's recovery , when it came , was rapid . And as it progressed , it became  --  to Polly at least ? frightening . It began when he broke his hour-long silence . He at last said something . A short statement ; none of those near him could quite make out what it was . Two or three minutes after speaking those incoherent words , Domingo was on his feet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and issuing harsh orders . He came out of shock , seemingly without transition , into grim , purposeful rage , driving her and the others of his crew to get the Pearl back into space . If there were any survivors here on the planetoid , he told his people brutally , they would have been found by now . Already they had checked out all of the defensive posts , the deep refuges that would have offered the only real chance of survival . Another ship 's captain , tears running down his own cheeks , approached Domingo on the ground , stressing the hopelessness , the pointlessness , of any immediate effort to lift their ships . It was too late to retaliate . Amid the shrieking wind , the driving , poisoned snow , the other captain 's voice came over the personal communication channel . " Do n't you un- derstand , Domingo ? It 's all over . . . the berserkers have got away . They 're gone . " Domingo glared like a madman at him . " Leviathan has n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships up ! " His voice was hoarse , almost unrecognizable . And Domingo 's own crew , who a moment ago had been trying to nurse him back to some first stage of recovery , now felt the lash of his words and had to get themselves aboard the Pearl and get ready to lift off . Polly at first had the feeling that what he was doing to his crew and the others was wrong and useless , but she did not dare to try to stop him . Demanding data , Domingo bullied everyone . He got them moving back to their duty stations , their shipboard instruments . He made them provide him with fresh observations , reports of ionization trails and other recent disturbances in the nebula nearby . These reports indicated that the destroyer machine  --  the readings confirmed that there had probably been only one berserker  --  was not long gone , probably no more than a very few hours . Domingo raged at them all . The burden of his ranting seemed to be that so much time had been wasted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shock , Captain . You were ? " " You were n't in shock . " He glared at the questioner . " Were you ? " They gaped at him . " If you could move and I could n't , you should have dragged me back on board . " They were all back on board now , and working . It was almost as if the still-smoldering pyres and gutted caverns of their homes below had already been forgotten . There was a quotation in Polly 's mind from somewhere , something about letting the dead bury the dead . That was all right , a healthy attitude , but to carry it to this extreme . . . she continued to observe Niles Domingo worriedly . When he first got to his  | Fred Saberhagen feet again , she felt relieved that he was recovering from the shock , rebounding from the initial blow more completely if not faster than the others who had suffered tragic losses . But Domingo 's energy had returned to him too suddenly , his grief had been transformed too rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a false recovery . But so far it was sustained . And it was pulling the others along with him . They were all bereaved to one degree or another , and almost as shocked as Domingo was . They actually benefitted from being dragooned aboard ship again , shouted at about their duty , hooked by the alpha rhythms of their brains into their crew stations and coerced into giving him reports . The necessity of routine , of following orders , formed a kind of support for them in their own shock ; at some level they all understood this , and so far they had submitted to it willingly . Such was the compulsion he exerted on the other people of his squadron that all six ships , with all their crew members aboard , had launched obediently within a few minutes of his order . The six ships rendezvoused in orbit . From this altitude , their homeworld looked not much different than it had before life was expunged from it . There was a radio silence . This time silence had not been imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment could find anything to say . Then Polly had an exchange of intercom dialogue with the captain . She asked him : " Where are we going ? " The features of Domingo 's face , viewed individually , looked the same as they had before fate in the form of a berserker had struck him down . Yet his face had altered , she thought , all the same . It was as if someone had got in under the flesh with a chisel and had done some carving on the bones . He answered her : " Where do you think we 're going ? We 're going after that damned thing . " Like his face , his voice had altered . The chisel had worked angles in it , too . Someone else broke in : " We ca n't ... "  | The protest was never finished . Nor was it answered . The captain left it hanging in the air , and told them to get busy . And no one else had yet dared to take up the banner of rebellion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inperson look at the captain 's countenance . She could call up his intercom image before her whenever she liked , but it was not the same . The radio silence was broken again . Some voices of dissension , mingled with pure lamentations , were calling in from other ships , questioning this hopeless pursuit . Domingo paid little heed to the dissenting voices or to the lamentations , either . He was again busy driving his ship . The few words he spoke to the captains of the other ships conveyed essentially the message : Follow me or not , just as you like . Where else are you going to go ? He drove the Pearl out into nebular space again , looking for the berserker 's trail . The five other ships came along . None of their captains  --  so far  --  was persuaded that it would be better to give up and turn away . Covertly Polly continued to watch his face on intercom whenever she was not fully occupied with her own job . She had given up hope , for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on inside his head . Continued shock , of course , and grief . But  --  what form was it taking ? What were his thoughts ? In fact , at the moment the captain 's only conscious thought was simply that his ship ran well . Better than that , it ran superbly . For the time being , for the moment , he was able to lose himself in the beautiful running of his new ship . He was momentarily content , even cheerful . There was no need for him to consider  --  to consider anything else at all . Outside , whitespace flowed by , smooth and at the same time intricate , like ruffling wedding lace . I have been so proud of this ship , Domingo thought , serenely watching instruments . Ever since I got it  --  not long ago , I admit  --  it 's been everything I ever hoped for in a ship .  | For ten years I 've wanted a new ship , because " Did you say something , Captain ? " That was Polly 's voice on intercom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " Nothing , " Domingo said . Then he ceased for a time to think at all . He only calculated how to get more speed . When he had the problem of speed settled , for the time being , he could think again . He was going to catch up with the berserker , the one that ten years ago . . . and now again ... he was going to catch up with Old Blue . Yes . And then .. . But soon it was obvious that the ionization trail was becoming painfully difficult to follow . He was as experienced at trailing as anyone  --  it was a valuable peacetime skill in the nebula , one ship trailing another just to keep from getting lost , or simply as a game  --  and he knew that the trails in the nebula sometimes faded , suddenly and inexplicably . He heard again from some of his own crew . They were watching the trail too , and his increasingly labored efforts to follow it . Henric and Simeon were now wondering pointedly if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The captain pointedly ignored their wondering . Some of the people on the other ships were less impressed with him than his own crew was . More of those other people were speaking up now , talking reasonably to him and to each other , forming the nucleus for a gentle and sad revolt . The berserker was gone , was the gist of what they said . This was n't really a trail any longer . Perhaps some day the damned thing could be hunted successfully and destroyed . But right now they , the survivors , had to take time to come to terms with themselves , with their own grief and loss . The reasonable , nonviolent view nearly prevailed . The other ships of Domingo 's squadron were all turning away now , the people aboard them voting that it was time to go to the Space Force for help . The Pearl moved on , along the fading trail  --  some of her  | crew arguing that the trail had already been lost  --  with Domingo still piloting . " Captain . Where are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . The same question had already been asked aboard the Pearl , but now it had a new context and was posed in a practical tone that deserved an answer , if anything practical was going to get done . Domingo 's reply was only slightly delayed , as if he were being thoughtful about it . And when it came it sounded perfectly rational . " All right . Set a course for the base , then . For Four Twenty-five . Iskander , you take the helm for a while . " Polly breathed a faint sigh of relief . That made sense . Base Four Twenty-five would have help to offer . As much of any kind of help as anyone in the Pearl 's squadron was going to get anywhere right now , as much as the universe could possibly have available for people who had lost all that they had lost . And if the hunt was still to be pursued , the base undoubtedly offered the best chance of obtaining information about where the berserker  --  Leviathan  --  had gone now . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain her condolences on his daughter 's death . Right now she was afraid to try . Domingo 's crew , still suffering from shock , were largely silent as their journey to Base Four Twenty-five began . But as the flight proceeded they began slowly to talk among themselves again . They had all been friends and neighbors once , just yesterday when they had lived in a community together . And they were certainly more than neighbors now . They were survivors together . Polly was n't sure that Niles Domingo was still a friend and neighbor of the others . All those others were perhaps too involved right now with their own grief and shock to notice the transformation . But Polly doubted that he was even listening to them any longer , that he was even living in the same world with the other people aboard his ship or in his  | squadron . Some of those people had certainly lost children too , some had lost whole families . But none of them had collapsed the way Domingo had  --  not yet anyway  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hideous , private world he was livingexisting  --  now , she could n't guess , much less try to share the experience with him . But she swore to herself that she would be ready when the chance came to help . Base Four Twenty-five was fairly near though in a different system from Shubra , on a planetoid that had remained otherwise uncolonized , and had no commonly used name of its own apart from the base . It was a barren rock , considerably smaller than Shubra , that supported a Space Force installation of modest size and virtually nothing else . Base Four Twenty-five was about a day away . It was going to be a long day for them all . The Pearl glided slowly into one of the row of berths built into the section of the shielded underground docks that was reserved for civilian visitors to the base . Other ships of the ill-fated orphan squadron were coming in behind the Pearl . None of the other ships had been quite as fast as Domingo 's Pearl in getting here , but he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already catching up . As the other craft arrived , they entered nearby berths . The crews of all six vessels disembarked , almost together . All of them were moving slowly , a reluctant step at a time ; it was as if the act of leaving their ships now might take them yet farther from everything that they had lost . The people of the Pearl , first to arrive , were also first to step out . Several Space Force people known to Domingo and to most of his crew had already come into view , standing on the dock , waiting to greet the arrivals sympathetically . The squadron had radioed its grim news ahead . At the head of the welcoming committee was the base commander , a man named Gennadius , tall and hollow-cheeked , looking chronically worn down as if by his job . Polly had  | seen him only once before , at some function a couple of years ago , and she knew that in the past he had fought at Domingo 's side against berserkers . It was obvious now from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Gennadius said " Niles " as the other approached , and followed with a one-word question : " Maymyo ? " Domingo looked at the tall man in front of him as if he had trouble comprehending the question . " She 's dead , " the captain said at last . It was as if he were talking about someone he had barely known . The base commander winced , with a more than social reaction . Polly made a mental note to herself that as soon as she had the chance she would ask this man for advice and assistance in helping the captain . Gennadius asked him : " How about you ? Come and rest . I want to have the medics look you over . " With a gesture Domingo brushed the notion aside . " They can look over some of my people if they want to be looked over . I 'm all right . What I want is to get to your operations room and see your current plot . " When one of the base medical people tried to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flourish that seemed to threaten violence . " Let me see the plot ! " Gennadius , with a much more modest gesture , called the doctor off . Then he led his old friend Domingo toward the operations room . Polly and a few others followed . Others of the bereaved crews sat down exhausted where they were , milled around lamenting afresh or accepted medical examination . The operations room , on the next level above the docks , was a large ovoid chamber , perfectly lighted , big enough for forty or fifty people to gather inside it at one time . In the approximate center of this chamber there was a computer model , itself the size of a small room , illustrating the explored portions of the Milkpail . A color key for the model was displayed nearby . After Polly had studied it for a few moments , she understood the  | essentials of the presentation . This was evidently what Domingo had called the current plot , indicating where within the Milkpail Nebula berserker attacks had recently been reported , and which additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . The model also showed the locations to which the battlecraft at Gennadius 's disposal , about twenty of them in all , had been dispatched , in an effort , Polly supposed , to try to intercept the enemy 's next attack . She could n't interpret all the symbols on the plot ; for one thing , she was unable to tell just how many ships of which kind were supposed to be where . One wall screen in the operations room showed the scene down in the visitors ' dock , where it appeared that three or four additional ships were now arriving , more or less together . Polly did not recognize them . Someone standing near her in operations said that they came from Liaoning . Having arrived home to find that their world had been destroyed , they had turned here to the base as the Shubrans had . Domingo handed over to Gennadius the recording on which Old Blue could be identified as the attacker . Then he demanded that the base commander tell him his plans for hunting down the berserker that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a good look at this first , " Gennadius said wearily , juggling the recording in his hand . " There might be some useful information , even if it does n't help us immediately . We 'll do an analysis . " " Piss on your analysis . " That expression was , by local custom , a much uglier way of swearing than to profane the names of half-forgotten deities and demigods . Polly had never before , in the months she had known the captain , heard him use this kind of language . It disturbed her to hear it now , more than she could logically explain . Again he demanded of the commander : " I want to know what you 're going to do about Leviathan . " Gennadius stood solidly , with folded arms . " I 'm going to  | run my command . To give as much protection as I can to the people in this district . I appreciate how you feel , Domingo ? " " Do you ? " " Yes . But my prime function is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berserker around , you know . " Domingo was silent . The base commander ( Polly got the definite impression that he was making allowances for his bereaved friend ) went on in a tired , methodical , soothing voice , explaining his current plans . From what Polly , who was no military expert , could understand of it , his basic strategy seemed to be more defensive than offensive . He wanted to detail the Pearl , with other ships from Shubra and Liaoning , as soon as they and their crews were ready to go out again , to guard duty over other colonies . There were perhaps twenty more Milkpail colonies still out there , potential targets for the berserker enemy . Gennadius intended to get as many armed ships as possible , including those of the bereaved colonists , out there to protect them . Domingo said , in his new hoarse voice : " At least you think those other colonies are still there . Still in existence . You do n't really know . " " That 's right . " Gennadius , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was still trying . " As far as I know , they 're still alive . Will you help them stay that way ? " Domingo spoke in the same voice as before , with no more or less expression . " Say there are twenty places to be guarded . If I take the Pearl to do patrol duty at one of them , I have one chance in twenty of encountering Leviathan at the next attack . That 's not good enough . " " Not good enough . " Gennadius repeated the words , as if trying to understand what they might mean . " Not good enough for what ? What are you proposing instead ? " " My ship goes along with your fleet , when you set out to hunt Leviathan . " " It 's not going to work that way , Domingo . " " Then I hunt the damned thing alone . "  | " That would not be wise . " Domingo 's monotonous voice pointed out that the Sirian Pearl was undoubtedly his ship , his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not going to have his ship assigned to guard duty anywhere . Speaking slowly and calmly , as if explaining to an idiot , he said that he intended to take the Pearl in pursuit of Leviathan , by himself if necessary . He felt confident , with a little preparation , of being able to follow and find the berserker anywhere in the nebula . Some of his own crew looked doubtful when they heard that announcement . The base commander meanwhile gazed off into the distance , as if trying to calculate something , or maybe to invoke some exotic technique of self-control . Polly tried to remember the version of interplanetary law obtaining in this sector . She thought it was technically true that even now , in this state of emergency with colonies being crushed like anthills under an iron heel , the military had no right , or had only a very doubtful right , to give orders to a civilian captain or to the mayor of a colony . But anyone as grown up as Domingo ought to know that being technically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know that , if he were in his right mind now . Gujar now joined the group in the operations room . The huge , bulky man looked totally exhausted . The bereaved bridegroom was completely on Domingo 's side in the argument ; Gujar wanted to press on with the chase , too . But the ship he had been piloting was not his own , and the woman who owned it was going to use it to get out of the Milkpail right away ; she was giving up . Gujar was unhorsed . Gennadius had returned to the argument with Domingo : " All right , maybe technically I ca n't give any of you orders right now . But I tell you I need help . And I would strongly suggest that you and anyone else who 's looking for a fight should take the Pearl and whatever other ships you have ,  | and provide some cover for people out there who need it badly . Leave the hunting to us . " " You 've just told us that the Space Force does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing of the kind . Let us do it in our own way . " But Domingo would n't listen . When one of the officers in the background thought aloud that the Pearl would have no chance alone against Leviathan , he turned on the woman and argued , without anyone being able to prove him wrong , that the Pearl was the equal in nebular combat of anything the Space Force had locally available ; and in fact superior to many of their ships . He argued too that his own ship was probably superior to any of theirs in this one task , hunting down and destroying a rogue berserker like Leviathan . Domingo had designed the Sirian Pearl himself , and at enormous expense had had her built  --  at the Austeel yards  --  primarily for that very purpose . " Really ? " asked someone who did n't know him , and therefore did n't believe it . " For ten years I 've wanted a ship that ? " He broke off that sentence and plunged into technical detail . The Sirian Pearl also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events of ten years ago , Domingo had been planning and working to equip himself with a ship that would not have to run from anything it might encounter in the Milkpail . Someone grumbled in a low voice that in the Milkpail , at least , it was still insane to go out with only one ship , whatever she was like , against any berserker , let alone that one . Iskander Baza put in : " Leviathan may have taken a lot of damage in those raids ; it must have taken some . " Domingo argued also that his ship had speed ; it had beaten all of the other ships here to the base , although most of them had started for it sooner . And it had , in himself , a veteran commander . And , he told the military people again , he was  | not convinced that they intended ever to hunt this enemy seriously , hunt it to the death . The response from Gennadius was stony silence . Domingo and his crew left the operations room . Polly stayed close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor outside . He looked around at her and at the four other people of his own crew . " We 're not lifting in the next ten minutes . But I am going after Leviathan as soon as I can get a hint of where to look for it . Those of you who do n't like that idea had better drop off the crew right now . " Iskander stood beside his captain , looking at the others , as if such a suggestion could not possibly apply to himself . There was no question that he was on the crew , no matter what . " I 'm staying on , " said Polly , and wondered at herself , though not as much as she would wonder later . Simeon and Wilma looked at each other , then both tentatively signed assent . Right now there were not a whole lot of choices about what else to do , where else to go . There was a pause , then Poinsot sighed . " I 'm dropping out , Domingo . You have to play it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still see some kind of future life for myself . I 've still got people , my sister and her kids , who are going to need me . " Polly recalled that Henric 's brother had been on Shubra too , in Ground Defense , but the brother 's family had been visiting elsewhere . " Drop out , then , " said the captain . Henric walked away . Gujar Sidoruk came out of the operations room , swearing at Gennadius , at the commander 's refusal to order a general hunt for Leviathan immediately . In a minute Gujar had officially signed on the crew as Poinsot 's replacement .  | Four days after the attack on Shubra , the entire crew of the Sirian Pearl was still at Base Four Twenty-five , as were a number of the people from the crews of the other Shubran ships . The rest of the Shubran survivors had taken their ships out to patrol as Gennadius had requested , putting aside their own grief to help guard some of the twenty or so other colonies that still survived within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He calculated that flying guard duty around a colony somewhere would give him at the most one chance in twenty of encountering Leviathan , and that was not enough . Polly had the impression that Gennadius thought the captain would come round in a little while and be willing to take the Pearl out on a defensive mission . But Domingo did not come round . Too full of vengeance to care about helping others , he waited at the base , along with those who were too shattered to care what happened to the other colonies , and a few other people who were too obsessed with the idea of  | immediately starting to rebuild , regaining what they themselves had lost . The military would shelter them all as refugees as long as necessary , feed them and provide them with spare clothing , but they could not remain its wards indefinitely . Eventually even the shattered ones would all have to go somewhere else , live again somewhere else , do something else with the remainder of their lives . It would be a matter of starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days at the base , a few of the Shubran survivors had approached their mayor , wanting him to take some initiative in finding a place or places away from the base for his few remaining citizens to settle , at least temporarily . But Domingo had no interest now in making that kind of effort . There was now only one subject that had any attraction for him at all . He gave Gennadius a strange smile when the base commander raised the matter of resettlement . Domingo answered : " A place to live ? What does to live ' mean ? " Gennadius looked at his old friend rather grimly for a few seconds , then turned and walked away . Domingo called after him : " What 's new on the operations plot ? " The question got no answer . Polly wanted to take Niles Domingo in her arms , to let him weep away some of the bottled grief that seemed to be driving him coldly and quietly insane . But he gave no indication of wanting to be in anyone 's arms for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her want to giggle nervously . She had never seen a human being who looked less likely to weep than Domingo did now . She waited for some change , for better or worse , in his condition . Polly had been able to piece together Domingo 's story , more or less , from scraps of conversation and from talk overheard , both at the base and earlier on Shubra . He had arrived in the Milkpail about twenty standard years ago as a  | very young man , accompanied by his timid young bride , a girl named Isabel . By all accounts he had loved Isabel deeply . Then about ten years ago his wife  --  she had never got over being easily frightened  --  had died in some kind of ship crash . Polly had never heard whether that disaster had been somehow related to berserkers or simply an accident . Two of Domingo 's three young children had died in that crash , too . He had not remarried . When Polly first met him a few months ago he had been a kindly man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kindly was not the word that came to her mind now when she looked at him or listened to him . Grim , certainly . There were probably more ominous variations on that word that would fit his present condition even more exactly , but right now Polly had no inclination to try to find them . At least the refugees at Base Four Twenty-five had plenty of room . The visitors ' quarters here at the base were extensive , because in more normal times they got a lot of use . But now everyone who still had a home had gone scrambling to defend it , and the remaining refugees had the place practically to themselves . For her own use , Polly had chosen a small single room next to the one where Domingo had indifferently allowed himself to be billeted . She saw little or nothing of him during the nights , but everything was quiet next door , as far as she could tell . So quiet that she began to doubt that he was ever there . Worried about Domingo on the first night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to look in on him , planning to make up a reason for the visit as required . Her brisk tap on his door remained unanswered , even when she repeated it . She called his name , then tried the door , which was unlocked . He was not in the little room at all . One of the flight bags he 'd had with him on the ship was sitting unopened on the narrow bed . There were no other signs of occupancy . Polly thought for a moment and found her captain in the  | next place she looked for him . He was back in his ship , wide awake , hunched over some instruments in the common room . On a wall screen a copy of that last surviving Shubran ground-defense recording was being played back , reenacting the destruction of his life . The ugly angular shape that was Leviathan came drifting in slow motion across the screen , dragging its blue glow under magnification that was still not enough to let it be seen very clearly . Weapons flared on the berserker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidently before the landers had been dropped , the smaller machines that must have dug out and sterilized the small shelters like Maymyo 's , for there was no sign of those devices here . The scene ran for only a few seconds , then automatically started over again . And yet again , as Polly watched , Domingo kept studying it intently , critically , as if the recorded onslaught represented no more than an engineering problem . Meanwhile the Pearl 's computer was working away in busy silence , constructing a colored holographic model of the whole nebula , one that Polly recognized as a smaller version of the plot on display in the operations room . When she came into the room , Domingo took his eyes from the screen just long enough to glance at her for identification purposes . " What is it , Polly ? " he asked her absently . She delayed answering the question , but the captain did n't even notice . The screen and model in front of him had immediately reclaimed his attention . Eventually it did dawn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up again , with more awareness in his eyes this time . " What is it ? " The excuses she had been mulling over , all suitable for dropping in on a friend in the next room , suddenly did not seem adequate to justify breaking in on a ship 's captain in the middle of a combat-planning session . So Polly blurted out part of the truth : " I was worried about you . " That at least appeared to get the captain 's full attention .  | Was that expression on his face intended to be a smile ? He said : " Do n't . There 's not enough left of me to worry about . " " I do n't believe that  --  I see a lot of you still there . " He had no real reply to that . He grunted something and sat waiting . She said : " You 're still determined to go after that berserker . " It was hardly a question . The captain nodded abstractedly . He was still looking at her , but his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polly asked : " Is that going to be a big help ? " His eyes returned to the holographic construction , and this time they stayed on it . He sat back with folded arms . " I think it will . " She moved a little closer to him and sat down on one of the built-in padded benches . " Tell me about it . " " It 's just a matter of trying to get into Leviathan 's brain and predict what he 's going to do next . " Domingo made that task sound almost easy . His eyes were still aimed at the model , but she had the impression that his gaze was focused far away . He had said he . What he 's going to do . Polly filed that information away for the moment . She asked : " Is there any way I can help you ? " Eventually his eyes came back to her . Sizing her up , he nodded , slowly and thoughtfully . " Yes . Of course you can help . When the time comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good crew . But right now . . . right now it 's just a matter of my getting this modeling done as accurately as I can . I think I prefer to do that myself . I want to know it perfectly . " She resisted the strong hint that the best help she could offer him at this moment would be to get out of his way . Instead she leaned back in her seat , as if she were comfortable . " That looks very much like the model in the operations room . " " It should . "  | " Has Gennadius given you access to the base mainframe computer ? Everything it has in memory ? " Domingo nodded . " He and I are still talking to each other . I told him I needed it , and he 's a reasonable man , up to a point at least . He wants all the fighting ships in his district as well equipped with information as they can possibly be . " Polly had more questions to ask ; but Domingo grew more restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developing model . She prolonged her stay only a little longer , because he so obviously would have preferred to be alone . She wanted her presence to be welcome . On the morning after that talk in the control room  --  base time was coordinated with that of some of the larger colonial settlements on nearby rocks  --  Polly was up at about the same time as most of the Shubran survivors . After eating breakfast in the common mess , she found a general discussion going on among a group of Domingo 's fellow citizens and sat in on it , listening . The group that had settled into a small meeting room after breakfast comprised some twelve or fifteen Shubrans , all of them crew members from the various ships in the orphaned Shubran relief expedition . Some of them were already well into the formulation of determined plans to reconstruct their lives , talking about going back to Shubra as soon as possible and rebuilding there , starting the colony over . Others in the group declared that they had had it with Shubra and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factions were not really trying to convince each other , Polly thought , and it seemed unlikely that the whole group could ever agree on any single course of action . While this discussion was in progress , Gennadius came to the door of the meeting room . The Base Commander looked somewhat happier than he had yesterday . " I have some good news , people . A manned courier ship has just come in from Sector . They 're responding fully , just as we had hoped , to  | the Liaoning disaster . I think we can take it as guaranteed that the response of the government will be the same in your case when they hear about it . Disaster funds should be available from Sector Government for resettlement on Shubra , too , or anywhere else in this district where they 're needed . " The people in the little group looked at each other . Both factions , the resettlers and those in favor of moving on , displayed generally pleased reactions . Someone asked hopefully : " You think we can depend on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can see , Sector still plans to have the whole Milkpail colonized some day . Even if now that looks like a rather distant goal . " Gennadius added : " And I want to see it , too . The more people there are living in my territory , the easier my job gets . " " Colonies can do well in the Milk , " someone offered , trying to be optimistic . " We 've just got to protect ourselves better . Nebula 's still full of life . " " A thousand-year career for busy berserkers , " objected one of the survivors who was ready to give up . No one among the optimists reacted noticeably . Cash in your chips if you want to ; we 're going on living . The discussion , informal but earnest and substantial , continued . The future of Shubra , Polly thought , was perhaps being decided here and now . Without the uninterested mayor . And without the high proportion of the Shubran survivors who were out in their ships , trying to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to worry about it  --  she had enough to worry about already . When Commander Gennadius left the meeting , she tagged along with him . He glanced sideways at her and , without breaking the rhythm of his long strides down the corridor , opened the conversation with his own choice of subject . " I 've got another roomful of people just down the hall here . " At that moment Iskander Baza passed them in the hall , exchanged nods with Polly , and looked after them curiously as they  | marched on . Gennadius continued speaking to her : " These are not refugees , for once . These are incoming , potential colonists , just in from Sector . Naturally their ship diverted here to base when her captain got word of our alert . I want to have a little talk with them before they start hearing everything about our problems at second hand . You 're welcome to sit in , if you like . I 'm not trying to whitewash the way things are . " " Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she entered the next conference room , where the atmosphere was vastly different from that in the one they had just left , though about the same number of people were present . The men and women assembled here looked different from the psychically battered colonists in the other room . These newcomers were obviously nervous but still healthy , without the indefinable appearance of victims . By now the newcomers had heard the full official announcement of the multiple disasters , which was a recital of bare facts , accurate as far as Polly could tell . And in the short time they had been on the base they had almost certainly heard more than that , from survivors and at second hand . They were , naturally enough , worried and uncertain . As Polly followed the commander into the conference room , one of the group was standing in front of the others , talking to them about berserkers . The speaker was one of the older people present  --  none were more than middle-aged ? and her voice carried sincerity if not necessarily authority . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simple . Trying to live in a sector where they 're active is like sticking your hand into a shredder . It 's just about as sensible as that , and as brave . " The speaker glanced over her shoulder , saw Gennadius looking at her , and finished defiantly : " I 've been through this before . I know what I 'm talking about ! " Polly could see the base commander pausing , deciding silently that this called for a more serious speech than he had first intended .  | Gennadius made no attempt to hush the woman , but let her finish . Only when she had returned to a seat did he himself take over her position at the front of the room . He looked out over his small audience calmly and gravely , letting a little silence grow . Then when he judged he had the timing right , he said : " All right . We 've had a very severe problem in the nebula the past few days . A series of disasters , in fact . But as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure against attack . Starting from here , and with the support of Sector , we 're prepared to take back what we 've lost  --  in terms of territory , at least . So there 's great opportunity in the Milkpail right now , the opportunity that I assume you 've all come here to find . " Gennadius went on , delivering an encouraging message without in the least fudging on the catastrophic facts of recent history . " Sure , we 've had severe problems , on the scope of some great natural disaster . But I ? " The commander appeared to grope for words . " How can I put it ? We are not facing some kind of demonic monsters here . I do n't know how many of you hold beliefs of any kind in the supernatural , or what those beliefs are . But never mind that , it does n't matter . What we are confronted with here are machines , just like ? like this video recorder . " While he was talking , the door to the corridor had opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain right at his shoulder . Their arrival was in time for them to hear the base commander 's philosophy regarding berserkers . Domingo spoke one word , in a soft voice : " Leviathan . " He said it as if it were the answer to some question that everyone in the room had been groping for . " Welcome , Captain Domingo . " Gennadius nodded toward the new arrivals . " A man who has had a very recent and very tragic experience with berserkers . He has ? " The captain smiled . It looked to Polly like a madman 's smile . " Not just with berserkers , Commander . With one  | particular . . . machine . That word 's inadequate , though , is n't it ? Machine . And the experience , as you call it , was not simply tragic . No . Tell them the truth . " Gennadius was exasperated now . " Your world was attacked by one machine that people have given a name to , as if it were some great damned artificial pet . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things . Why is the word machine inadequate ? That 's what a berserker is . " " Oh , is it ? Tell me more . " Domingo 's voice was still quiet . " There 's not much more to tell . Essentially . If you want to know the truth , it and the others are no more than overgrown , out-of-adjustment machines . " Domingo had no comment on that for the moment . He listened in silence as the base commander continued his efforts to encourage the potential new colonists . With all the news of berserkers in the air , Gennadius said , he wanted to dissuade them from the idea that the obstacles were just too overwhelming . " Some people get the notion that the berserker problem can never be managed . That 's wrong . They 're machines , that from our point of view happen to be malfunctioning . That 's all they are . And if we can keep a sun from going nova , as we sometimes can , then we can ultimately manage a few machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think Leviathan 's only a machine ? That it just happens to be out of adjustment ? " He paused . " I 'd like to show you what it is . I 'd like you to be there when I pull out its heart . " Gennadius coldly returned the captain 's burning stare . " You 've had a hard time , Domingo , but you 're not the only one who has . I respect what you 've done , and what you 've been through , but getting revenge on a piece of metal is a crazy enterprise , in my opinion . " Polly sucked in her breath audibly . She sensed that the commander 's words were a deliberate shock tactic , but she did n't think that it would work .  | The would-be colonists were watching and listening very , very intently . Their heads turned back and forth like those of spectators at a match . " Only a piece of metal . You think that ? " " That 's what they are . You have some kind of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . " " Is my body a machine ? Or yours ? Or was my daughter 's ? What was her body , Commander ? What was it ? " There was a pause that seemed long . At last Gennadius said : " In a manner of speaking , I suppose we 're all machines . I do n't see the point of looking at it that way , though . " " I can see that you 're a machine , " said Domingo , looking at the commander speculatively . Polly could feel her scalp creep . Not from the words ; something in the tone . The potential colonists were still watching and listening with great attention . The commander , she could see , was working hard at being almost casual and even harder at being tolerant . Polly supposed he did not want to freight this madman 's behavior with importance in the eyes of the others watching . " If you have tactical suggestions to make , Captain , I 'll be glad to listen to them up in the operations room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on . You 're still mayor of Shubra . Some of these people might be interested in going there . I think it 's your place , your duty , to talk to them and ? " " If I 'm still mayor of any place , it 's hell . As for your rebuilding , I want none of it . " " As mayor , you ? " " You want my resignation ? " " It 's not my place to accept it . Talk to your citizens . " Then the commander softened . " We 've all lost , Niles . Not like you , maybe , but . . . we 've got to start thinking of where we go from here . There are decisions that wo n't wait . "  | " I know what wo n't wait . " Domingo looked at the commander , and at Polly . She could get no clue from his eyes as to what he expected her to do . A moment later he had left the room . When she followed him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already out of sight .  | The Sirian Pearl , along with the other ships of the Shubran civilian relief squadron , had seen no actual fighting and had sustained no damage while shuttling from one disaster to another . Such minor refitting as was required to get her perfectly ready for action had already been taken care of at the base . The Space Force had been eager to help with the maintenance . Gennadius wanted every human ship in the nebula to be as fully armed and equipped and ready for combat as possible . More combat was expected soon , though with berserkers you never knew . Anyway , it was certain to come eventually . The Pearl was almost alone in the docks , except for a few Space Force ships , a couple of them undergoing routine maintenance , a couple of others being held in reserve as transport and for defense in the unlikely event of a berserker attack on the base itself . Four Twenty-five had truly awesome ground defenses . From the enemy 's point of calcula- tion , there had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies only lightly defended now after the years of relative peace and quiet . Domingo 's ship was solidly down in dock , with Gujar Sidoruk and Iskander Baza walking and climbing over and around her , giving everything on the outside a looking over , probing with tools and fingers into missile-launching ports and tubes , field projectors , the snouts and nozzles of beam weapons . The checkout was really unnecessary , but Gujar at least was nervous enough to need something to do . Iskander had come along , and they talked while they conducted an extra inspection . Iskander , hands on hips , stood tall on the uppermost curve of hull . He said : " You know , Sid ? " " What ? " " I 'm really looking forward to taking this ship into action . " He sounded more serious than usual . Gujar straightened up from a beam nozzle and looked about restlessly , swinging his electronic probe in one huge hand . He responded that he himself was not looking forward to anything . Going after Leviathan was just something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over with . Sidoruk was not as familiar with this ship as the other crew members were . He had a few questions to ask about the new weapons and systems Domingo had insisted on having built into his ship . Gujar had been taking it for granted that the Pearl 's armaments were adequate for the formidable task Domingo was planning . But now it seemed to him that , in answer to a couple of his questions , Iskander was slyly trying to raise some doubt in his mind , as if just for fun . Gujar was still frowning in vague puzzlement when the two men heard footsteps approaching , clomping up a flexible ladder that curved around the curve of hull . Presently Polly Suslova 's head and shoulders came into sight . She greeted the two men and asked , " Where 's the captain ? "  | Baza smiled at her . " He 's aboard . I looked in half an hour ago and he was sleeping . " Despite the smile , she had the feeling that this man was hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baza , as far as she was aware , had had no family anywhere , even before the Shubran massacre . " Good , " she said . " I 'll let him sleep . He needs the rest . " She looked at Gujar , who was leaning against the railing of the curving stair , gazing glumly into space . He did n't appear to be listening to the conversation , but it was hard to tell . Polly faced back to Iskander , as the second-in-command asked her : " You think the captain 's unhealthy ? I do n't . " " Have you seen him like this before ? " " Like what ? " Polly could read no feeling in Iskander 's smooth voice . " He 's ready to hunt berserkers . If that makes him crazy , there 're a lot of lunatics around . " " I 'm sure there are . The point is that until a few days ago he was n't one of them . " " He 'll be all right , when he gets Leviathan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Gujar . " If he can get it . " " He can . " Sidoruk turned around , frowning . " I thought you were just telling me our weapons might not be good enough . " Polly asked Iskander : " Do you think that 's what Domingo needs ? " " He thinks so . " Baza started to move past her to the ladder . " Excuse me , ma'am . It 's time I went to operations and took a look at things . " Polly moved out of Iskander 's way , but she had another question for him before he left . " You 've known the captain a long time . Were you with him when that crash almost wiped out his family ten years ago ? " " I was . But you 'd better ask him about that . " And with a lightly mocking little salute , Iskander was gone . Gujar Sidoruk had roused from his unhappy reverie enough  | to pay attention to Polly 's latest question . " What do you want to know about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in that , too . " Ships disappeared , sometimes , in every part of space , even without berserkers ' help . " Yes , I remember it well . It was n't just berserkers . It was the same damned one . " Thinking of Domingo , Polly let out a little wordless moan of empathic pain . She sat down on the curve of hullcarefully ; the metal tended to be slippery and there was a considerable drop . " Tell me . " " Well . His wife  --  her name was Isabel  --  and two of their three kids were on a ship coming back from somewhere , I forget where , to Shubra . The ship managed to send off a courier before she crashed . Her captain thought Leviathan was chasing them , and the courier message said he was just about to take some risky evasive action . That was all that anyone ever heard from that ship . Either the berserker got them , or he wrecked his ship trying to get away from it . Tried to go too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up anywhere . No survivors . " " I see , " Polly murmured again . Again someone 's feet were clanging solidly up the ladder . In a few moments Simeon 's head came into view . " There you are  --  some of you , anyway . There 's news . One of Gennadius 's squadrons is supposed to be straggling back in here to the base , all shot up . They tightbeamed a message ahead , saying they 've just fought a battle . " " And ? " " Mixed results , apparently . " Polly grabbed for the ladder . " Coming , Gujar ? " He shook his head slowly . " You go ahead . I want to look over a few more things here . Whatever the news is , I expect we 'll be launching before long . " Polly descended the ladder quickly . There was someone else who would certainly want to hear the latest combat news the instant it became available . Iskander had said that Do- mingo was asleep . She debated briefly with herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The captain was not in his berth . Well , she supposed it had been foolish to look for him there , no matter what Iskander had said . She found Domingo in the common room again , sitting slumped over and motionless at the console beside his computer model , almost on top of it . His face , with the reflected colors of the glowing model playing over it , was turned toward Polly as she entered and she was worried for a moment ; he looked absolutely dead . A closer look reassured her . Domingo was breathing deeply and comfortably , getting what was probably one of his first real sleeps since the disaster . But Polly , sure that he would want to know the news , decided to wake him anyway . She shook him by the shoulder . The captain 's eyes opened at once , and he saw her without apparent surprise . He was glad to be awakened for the news , grim as it was , and was on his feet at once . Pausing only to shut down some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strides , Polly tagging along . They were in time to be present when Base Commander Gennadius greeted the arriving crews . The newly arrived military ships had brought with them another item of related news : yet another berserker attack upon a colony , the third in recent days . This time the target had been Malaspina , a planetoid of a sun that was relatively distant within the nebula . Malaspina was known for the foul " weather " ? nebular turbulence and activity  --  that usually afflicted both its atmosphere and its surrounding space . Before the returning fleet had fought its recent battle , its ships had picked up some peculiar radio messages from the direction of the colonized planetoid Malaspina , messages reporting the sighting of strange ships or objects in the nebula near Malaspina . Very shortly after picking up the radio transmissions , the fleet had been found by a robot courier from  | the attacked colony . The courier brought an urgent and now horribly familiar message : Colony under berserker attack . Gennadius , as he listened to this story , appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't there another report of some really peculiar nebular life forms around there just a standard month ago ? " Some of his aides standing nearby were able to confirm this . " That 's not all , " said one of the exhausted ship captains who had just arrived . According to later messages received by the rescue fleet , some of the people at the third colony were reported to have behaved bizarrely during the attack . " Hysteria , " said someone on the base commander 's staff . " I suppose . Anyway , one of the radio messages we got said they were acting crazy  --  tearing off their clothes , singing . Running around wild , I guess . Those were about all the details we heard . " " You have recordings ? " " Of the action we just fought ? They 'll be along in a minute , Commander . " Others among the people at Base Four Twenty-five , who were now trying to evaluate events , at first attributed the reported bizarre behavior of the people at the colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of some virus . The task force , responding with all possible speed to the courier-borne report of that attack , had arrived at the battered colony in time to save it from destruction . The combat recordings were now being brought into the operations room . Polly retreated into the background , but no one cared if she and the other colonists present stayed to watch . The light in the large room dimmed slightly , and a stage brightened . The ranking officer of the ; ask force that had just arrived introduced the combat recordings , which told the story . When the powerful Space Force battle group had appeared  | on the scene , the berserker raiding fleet had broken off its assault on Malaspina and retreated . The Space Force had arrived none too soon ; the battle had been going badly for the human side until then . Three or possibly four berserkers had been engaged in this latest attack . A staff officer swore . " Look at that ; some kind of new shielding . Cuts off the defensive beams from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That explains how they were able to overrun Liaoning and Shubra so fast and easy . " When the berserkers retreated from their attack on the Malaspina colony , the human task force had pursued and engaged them again after a chase of about an hour . Again , disengagement by the enemy and pursuit by the Space Force . This time the human squadron had promptly run into a well-executed ambush . Loop back on your own trail within the nebula  --  if you could manage that  --  and ambushing a pursuer came within the realm of possibility . Shortly thereafter , having suffered a reverse and again lost contact with the enemy , the commander of the Space Force battle group turned back to protect Malaspina . Gennadius nodded . " You say you 'd already left a detachment there . " " That 's right . " Gennadius now tried to decide where he could get ships to relieve the ones now on duty at Malaspina . The enemy was enjoying such success that he had to think of the defense of the base itself . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Malaspina  --  if I can come up with enough civilian volunteers . " He switched the direction of his gaze . " Do-mingo ? " Domingo , who had been listening intently , ignored the question . He asked the returning officers : " Was Old Blue there , at Malaspina and afterward ? There was a unit that looked like it in that recording , but I could n't be sure . " Some of the men and women exchanged looks . " Oh yeah , " said one . " No doubt about it . "  | " You did n't destroy it . " It was more a statement than a question . " No . We did n't . " Polly thought she saw her captain 's shoulders slump slightly , as if with relief . Domingo said : " I 'd like to see the rest of your gun-camera records as soon as possible . " Another look was exchanged among the haggard captains of the surviving task force : Who is this guy ? Gennadius seconded Domingo 's question . " Coming right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . These confirmed conclusively , and in stop-action detail , the presence of Leviathan in the action off Malaspina . It was Polly 's first good look at the thing called Old Blue  --  the fragmentary recording from Shubran ground defense hardly counted . Here there were views from several angles , in different wavelengths . Imaging techniques corrected for the exaggerated Doppler effect of high-speed combat . This was about as good a look at Leviathan as anyone had ever had and survived . Polly and the others watching with her now beheld a great , ancient , angular and damaged shape , with some blue coloring about it ; she had heard that the color was thought to be the result of some emissions from some defective component of the drive or other peculiar system on board . Polly watched . That is his special enemy , and therefore it is mine . If 1 ca n't turn him from his purpose , maybe I can help him to achieve it . Maybe then .. . They were frightening pictures , but to her , Domingo 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without taking his eye from the new recording as it played again , beckoned an aide over to him . Polly heard the base commander issuing grders to pass on word of what he saw as a disastrous battle to Eighth Space Force headquarters , at the Sector capital . A manned courier , recently arrived at Four Twenty-five , was about to head back to headquarters and could carry this bad news with it .  | Gennadius was now asking the crew of the courier if there was much chance of his getting any reinforcement from Sector Headquarters in the near future . " Would n't count on that , sir . There 's berserker trouble in other districts , too , and Sector 's chronically spread thin . " " Yes . Damn , damn . That 's about what I thought ; maybe even a little worse than I thought . " Gennadius turned his gaze to the big display . " We 're just going to have to mobilize all the colonies in the Milk as best we can . " " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next courier we send to Sector , I want to tell them I 'm invoking martial law over the whole Milkpail district . Get that in print for me to sign . " Then his eyes swiveled to Domingo . " Niles , I want you to take your people , all of ' em that are ready to fight and all your ships , and stand by for Home Guard duty . Might be at Malaspina , might be somewhere else . " " I 've told you where I stand on that , Gennadius . Captains who want to do that can . I have other plans for my own ship . And for as many of my crew as will come with me . " " Oh . And what plans are those ? " " I 'm hunting for Leviathan . " The room was quiet enough for Polly to hear the sigh Gennadius let out . " With one ship . That does n't make any sense . I 've told you what I need done . If you wo n't do that , then just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes , home . Where is that ? " " Go somewhere and stay out of my hair , then . Sorry , Domingo . But other people are hurting , too . And this time it is an order . I 'm invoking martial law . " There was a long pause before Domingo spoke . His answer when it came was surprisingly meek . " All right , Gennadius . I 'll be out of your way from now on . " Domingo summoned his crew to him with a look around the room , and they followed him when he went out quietly . When they were gathered around him in the corridor just  | outside operations , he announced quietly that he wanted to have a crew meeting in his ship immediately . A minute or two later the six of them were gathered in the common room aboard the Pearl . The captain looked around the little group and told them he had allowed the Space Force people to think he was obeying their orders meekly , that he would go home and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 11 " But if any of you actually thought I was going to obey that order , forget it . This ship is going on with the hunt just as before . " Henric Poinsot had joined the others in their gathering outside operations , and he had accompanied them to the ship , saying he wanted to remove a few personal things that he had left aboard . But Poinsot now came into the common room and asked the captain : " What about the other people from Shubra ? " " What about them ? " " I mean that we have about twenty of our fellow citizens still here at the base who 'll want to know what the hell you 're doing , Domingo . About Shubra , if nothing else . You 're still officially the mayor . " " I 'll nominate you to take a message to them . They can have my formal resignation , if they want it . If any of you get tired of gazing at the wreckage where you used to live , you can try to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 11 The captain spoke coldly and contemptuously . The people who knew Domingo best , better than Polly had yet had a chance to get to know him , were gazing at him strangely . If he was aware of it , he gave no sign . Iskander Baza watched his captain narrowly and then exchanged looks with Polly . She wondered if the message was that he intended to be her ally or her rival . Henric Poinsot said : " You 're disregarding the commander 's orders , then . I 'm making no promises to keep any of this secret , Domingo . "  | " Tell who you like , and be damned to you . It 'll save me the trouble of leaving a message somewhere else . " Poinsot looked around at them all , started to speak again , thought better of it and went out . Domingo looked around at them all , too . " Anyone else ? Now 's the time . " " I 'm hunting with you , " Gujar Sidoruk said . " Good . Polly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . It came to her as she said it that her chief fear at the moment was only of being separated from him . She was more afraid of that than of berserkers . When she tried to think of her children , all she could know of them at the moment was that they were far away and safe . " Iskander ? ? I guess in your case I do n't have to ask . Wilma , Simeon , what about you ? " The married couple spoke haltingly . Taking turns speaking , looking at each other between phrases , they said that they had lost heavily to the berserkers and wanted revenge . Polly got the impression that there was more to their decision than they were saying . The Pearl was already gone when Poinsot told Gennadius of Domingo 's decision . The base commander , his mind heavily engaged with other matters , only nodded and sighed . Knowing Domingo , he was not all that surprised . All Gennadius said was , " Well . We 've each done what we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sirian Pearl from his roster of Home Guard craft . He would have to remind himself to count it as lost from now on , and it was going to make his job just that much harder .  | The Pearl , with Gujar Sidoruk now aboard her as a member of her crew , departed Base Four Twenty-five without filing an official flight plan . Her captain set a course and then turned the flight controls over to Iskander Baza , his second-in-command . After a few words with Baza , Domingo headed for his cabin berth  --  his tiny padded cell , or womb , was more like it , he thought  --  to try to get some rest . Getting to his berth was easy . He had only to crawl through the short , narrow padded tunnel that connected the captain 's duty station with the captain 's private quarters , the latter only a hollow , padded cylinder , no roomier or more luxurious than the berth of anyone else aboard the ship . The captain 's quarters , like the other berths aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that only by the standards of a military ship . Still , two people had been known to occupy this p bin on occasion . There would be no cabinmate on this voyage . Domingo  | removed some of his outer clothing , turned down the intensity of the cabin lights and the various displays and settled himself to try to get some sleep if possible . If he could n't sleep , he would take something .. . There was no need for him to take anything . His exhaustion was greater than he had imagined . Almost immediately , Domingo slept . And dreamed . Never , in the course of the deathlike sleeps that overcame him in this last epoch of his monstrously altered life , had the captain dreamed of Maymyo his murdered daughter , flesh of his flesh . Nor had he ever , before or after the obliteration of the Shubran colony , dreamed about berserkers . Such visions as had come in sleep to Domingo since that disaster were few and seemed meaningless . But now , riding his new ship in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular dream that he had not had for years . In this dream he was near Isabel , his wife , and the two of his three children , all little ones then , who had been with her when she died . Maymyo , his third child , had no part in this dream ; she had somehow been wiped away , as if she had never existed . In this dream the ship carrying three members of his young family had come home to Shubra after all . The reports of its destruction had been only an accident , a great mistake , now satisfactorily explained away . In the dream he , Domingo , was back on Shubra , working peacefully outdoors under the pearly sky , and Isabel was somewhere near him . Though he could not see her , he knew his wife was there , somewhere just out of sight , and he knew she had the two little children safely with her . He felt so sure of Isabel 's nearness , her availability , that he was not even worried because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he still could not see her moment by moment as the dream wore on . In this dream he himself was always busy , trying to do something , accomplish some task . What the job was , he could never remember when the dream was over . But while  | the dream was in progress , this work , whatever it was , kept him too intently occupied to even try to look at Isabel .. . She was there , and at any moment now he would complete his work and be able to go to her . He awoke from the dream alone in his berth on his new ship , aware of the light-years of emptiness just outside the hull . On departing the base , Domingo had not turned his ship immediately in the direction of Malaspina , as some of his crew had anticipated . He hoped and expected to be able to pick up a fresher trail than that . About two days after leaving Base Four Twenty-five , the Sirian Pearl arrived at the scene of the last fight reported by Gennadius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galactic coordinates were almost impossible to determine inside the Milkpail , but there could be no mistaking the still-widening disturbances that had been left in this region by the weapons used in the recent battle . Shockwaves expanding at kilometers per second for a number of days had made quite a conspicuous disturbance . " Figure it out , " Iskander said to Simeon , to whom most of this business of searching and trailing in the nebula was new . " Say an expansion rate of ten kilometers a second ; then in a little more than a day you have a bulging cloud about a million kilometers across . " Such a disturbed cloud was still a tiny tumor in the guts of an object the size of the Milkpail , big enough to contain a dozen known solar systems and perhaps a few more that had not yet been discovered . Quite apart from the battle 's gaudy traces , this region of the nebula was a place of unearthly beauty , of scenery remarkably spectacular even for nebular space . Sharp variations in nebular density , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural features . Some of the fantastic shapes could be interpreted as halls and mansions , built on a scale to contain'planets . The Pearl moved steadily on through these and similar vistas.  | Wilma said once , looking into a screen that was almost like a window : " Some people used to think that heaven looked like this . All white clouds and marble halls . " No other ships had joined Domingo in his hunt , and there was no reason to think that any were likely to do so . Most of the Pearl 's crew were worried by that fact , but Domingo never seemed worried now , by that or anything else . Except for one thing : that something might keep him from getting at Leviathan . Simeon and Wilma began to wonder aloud what their friends who had declined to take up the chase were doing . The captain ignored their wondering , as he ignored much else . Now the obsessed man displayed fanatical patience . He briefed his crew carefully on exactly what he wanted , then ordered two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch to begin a methodical investigation . The idea was to sift as minutely and carefully as they could through the thinly scattered debris of this battlefield , gathering samples of microscopic dust and thin gas , looking for material that would convey information of any kind about the berserkers , particularly Leviathan . More precisely , of course , the idea was to find the trail of Old Blue 's departure . To this end , the Pearl circled the volume of space in which the battle had taken place , stopping at intervals to let out the launch and the suited collectors . This process continued for half a day until they had closed in on what Domingo considered the most promising place to start a really detailed search . And to augment the human crew , a couple of service robots were put to work in space . The nebula here was still torn and mottled by the contending energies that ships and machines had spent against each other . Most of the battle-distorted clouds were still expanding , at meters or tens of meters or perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material as they swelled . But emission clouds , red-shifting now as they cooled and contracted , were splashed like blood through  | the contorted whiteness . That these particular clouds were contracting was a hopeful sign ; shrinking clots of murk would not hide a trail as still-expanding clouds might easily have done . Whatever departure trails might exist here were already badly blurred out with the passage of several standard days since the battle was fought . The natural movements of material in the nebula were wiping the traces away . But Domingo stubbornly urged on the search . Polly continued to observe her captain whenever she had the chance . She had tried to convince herself that she was accompanying him on this mad expedition at least in part for the sake of her children , to rid the Milkpail of the horror called Old Blue so that these little worlds would offer safe places in which her offspring might grow up and live . That would have been a worthy goal , but in her heart she knew better . She was doing this because she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought , gazing again at his intercom image and wondering about him and about herself . She had no history of falling as drastically as this for men . Particularly for men who showed no special interest in her . She wondered also if her feelings were obvious to others . Probably they would be , she decided , if everyone were n't moving around in a state of benumbed shock just now , if all this hell were n't going on . Maybe then her attitude would have been noticeable even to him . Now she wished that she had managed to talk to Gennadius about him before they left Base Four Twenty-five . But she had n't . There had n't really been time , for one thing . The base commander had been continuously busy . And Domingo had seemed strong and capable again  --  as he still did  --  and he and Gennadius had obviously been at least temporarily at odds with each other . She wanted to have a real talk with Iskander sometime , too ; she thought she did n't understand him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to arrange it . She thought  | that Baza was now closer to Domingo than anyone else was , though the relationship did not seem to fall into any neat category . Her worry about Domingo was as intense as before , though now , active in the chase , he looked stronger and more capable than ever , and his behavior since they had left the base had given her no new cause for alarm . He seemed buoyed up , energetic and almost happy , as long as he could keep driving toward his goal of vengeance . Vengeance on a piece of metal , as Gennadius had described it at one point . But Polly was worried by Domingo 's happy energy . He 's going to snap , she thought . Or something . He has n't had time to grieve over his daughter properly yet . Coming on top of what happened ten years ago , the shock of Maymyo 's death has turned him away , somehow , from being human . There were periods , sometimes of hours , more often only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fears were wrong , based on a mistaken assessment . He was just an extraordinarily tough man , and he had survived the blow of his daughter 's death . Naturally he was still enraged at the universe , and challenging his bitter fate . Eventually he was going to be all right . But the conviction could not last for long ; her fears returned . Carrying out the search for microscopic evidence just the way Domingo wanted it done was not an easy job . In the common room , at the daily meeting for discussion and planning , Gujar Sidoruk protested : " We need a fleet to do this properly . " Domingo paid little attention to the protest . " Well , we do n't have a fleet . But we 're going to do it effectively anyway . " Several more standard days passed while the search went on . The Pearl prowled slowly . She was beautifully designed for almost any type of nebular work , built by the almost legendary teams of master artisans and computers working in the orbital yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvered egg , at the center of the little formation of people and machines that searched the nebula  | around her , all of them continuously taking samples , testing , seeking patterns . Polly had her own suit of custom-designed space armor , a tool that came in handy fairly often in her regular job . Now she was out of the launch , working in what was sometimes called milkspace , searching . And trying to keep from being distracted by the scenery . Not that the environment outside a ship was anything new to her ; she had been born on one planetoid within the Milkpail and raised on another . But still her opportunities to get a direct look at a region of the nebula as exotic as this one had been few and far between . She was not watching the view of marble halls and eternal sunrises on a holostage connected to her instruments now , or on a screen , but looking at the nebula itself through the transparent solid of her faceplate . It was difficult for the eye to interpret the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues of pearl and bone , milk and chalk and fine-grained snow . Just how big was that particular cloud formation , how far away . . . ? And visible within the clouds at times there was movement , not all of it inanimately caused . Life grew here , and sometimes it swarmed in profusion . Creatures of microscopic size could alter the shape of a cloud or change the quality of light when they moved in sufficient numbers . The changes did not signify intelligence or sentience ; those qualities were apparently more than the ubiquitous energies of life could organize within matter this attenuated . But on the microscopic and near-microscopic level , there was a rich variety of life . The discovery Domingo had been trying for , of a departure trail that might be followed , so far had not been made . Bits of evidence would be very easy to miss , here among the distractions of beauty and danger and strange life . " You 're going to need all your luck , Cap , " Iskander Baza told him . " Luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  | have to do with luck ? " Leviathan itself was surely not a matter of luck ; the malevolent purpose of the ancient Builders flowed in its circuits as surely as the life flowed in any human being 's veins and nerves . Whatever else it might be , it was no accident . Nor were his own encounters with the damned thing accidental . Domingo was sure of that now , certain on the deepest possible level . He could close his eyes and feel it . The hoped-for trail might still elude discovery , but the search had also already yielded information of another kind about the berserkers . Computer analysis showed that certain inhuman , unusual organic traces were to be found in the nebular material where the battle had been fought . In itself , organic matter in the nebula was nothing very unusual . There was , after all , an industry devoted to harvesting and processing it . But here , in one sample , the ship 's computer was able to detect evidence of deliberate genetic manipulation , laboratory work performed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of debris you 'd get from micromicrosurgery . Whatever the process was , it must have been performed on a large scale for us to be able to pick up traces of it now . " " It ca n't be from one of the Space Force ships , then . Are berserkers starting to do surgery ? " " They 've been known to engage in biological research . " " Well , true , it would n't be the first time in history they 've tried it . But maybe the evidence is misleading . This could be just berserker parts and parts of some human researcher 's equipment and results , all mashed into the same cloud . " " What human researcher would that be ? Working out here ? " No one could come up with an answer for that . For the berserkers to attempt biological warfare against ED humanity by means of microorganisms was nothing new . Historically the death machines had rarely had much success with the tactics of spreading disease . If they were trying it again , probably they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  | Alternatively , the theoretical and practical problems of disease and how to spread it might not be what suddenly interested the berserkers in the field of biology . But , what was it then ? The main computer on the Pearl announced that it now had a sufficiency of data ; it was ready to present a model of the battle .  | The common room on the Sirian Pearl was the only place aboard ship where six people could meet face to face and still have a little central space to spare . The greater part of that central space was presently occupied by a holostage , and on that holostage the ship 's computer was currently engaged in building an elaborate image-model of the local disturbances within the nebula . For the time being the other model , the one that showed the whole Milkpail , had been tucked back into the data storage banks . Not that the six people of the crew were very often in the common room at the same time . At least two were usually at their duty stations , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin adjoining one of the six duty stations . Like Domingo 's cabin , the five others were little more than large padded barrels furnished with cots , communications and plumbing . Polly , like several other people , spent a fair amount of time in the common room , sitting beside the stage and watching the construction job with interest . With even greater  | interest , but less openly , she also watched Domingo , who was fanatically intent upon the model . When the model displaying current local conditions was completed , the computer , on the captain 's order , ran it through an extrapolation back in time . The dispersed explosions that were only dimly detectable in the nebula itself became smaller and clearer in the model as the extrapolation progressed . The tentatively charted tracks of disturbance assumed a sharper , more definite form . Now it was possible to have a much more precise view of what had happened here some days ago in the battle between the Space Force and the berserkers . Here , at this side of the display , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of confrontation . And over there on the other side had been the enemy , four or possibly five berserkers in all , strung out in a jagged line some hundreds of kilometers long that might or might not have been meant as a tactical formation . That much , the positions before tactical movement started , could be confidently read from the reconstructed cloud disturbances and the distributions of trace elements in the clouds . So could the positions at the start of fighting . The opposing types of weapons , when fired , and even the drive engines had left subtly different flavors in the resultant expanding gasses . Combat maneuvers must have begun immediately when the opposing forces sighted each other  --  indeed , the human survivors had so reported . The course of events after the fight had started was harder to reconstruct . Domingo called for more sampling in selected areas . Armored people went out into space again , and the computer kept working . Gujar , who had been so eager to sign on , began grumbling . " Why is he doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iskander smile l faintly . " He 's looking for a trail . Domingo knows what he 's doing . " " Does he ? I can see scanning the area for that . Not that there would be much chance of finding anything . But what  | difference does it make what the exact positions were of all the units ? " " We 'll see . " Iskander still sounded confident . When the additional data gathered by a few more hours ' work in space was fed into the computer , the pictured past became visible in greater detail . Two Space Force ships , as reported by the crews of the surviving vessels , had blown up with all hands lost . A couple of berserkers had also been destroyed  --  their climactic finishes were plain to see , marked by radii of flying debris . And at least one more of the enemy had been badly damaged . The battered berserker had got away . It must have done so , because it was nowhere in the immediate vicinity now , and no image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds . Evidently the other surviving berserkers had departed unhurt or only lightly damaged . There were faint and fading tracks for them , too attenuated to try to follow . But the badly damaged bandit had gone its own way , and it had certainly left a spoor behind it ? a thousand times too thin for the eye to see , but evident to the technique of computer-analyzed sampling . A staggering trail of particles , a skein of what would have been smoke in atmosphere , a fading blaze of heat and radiation , led off toward an unexplored portion of the Milkpail into the heart of a white knot of nebula as wide as the orbit of the distant Earth . " That 's it ! That 's it . By all the gods , we 'll get one of them now . " The captain 's voice was a hoarse whisper . As soon as he had accepted the conclusion of the computer model , Domingo recalled those of his crew who were still outside the ship engaged in the task of gathering more data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems that let them cruise at a sufficient speed in space , remained outside still working at that task . The two mobile robots , Domingo calculated , should be enough to sniff out the trail , now that its origin was located . The moving fields of the ship would drag the small machines with her as she advanced .  | The Pearl moved out again , running a little faster than before , hunting now with weapons ready . The model in the common room was continuously updated as the robots continued to take samples at distances of up to a few hundred kilometers from the moving ship and to telemeter the results in to the Pearl 's main computer . Excitement grew . Polly took her brief periods of rest grudgingly , afraid of what discoveries she might miss . Between rest periods she observed Domingo , snatched bites of food , stood watch in her turn and otherwise helped out where she could . She had seen an effort vaguely like this search attempted once before , by someone else , and not successfully . That time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found , not a berserker . She said to him once : " You really know how to do this , Captain . " At the moment he looked happy and , despite the long hours of concentrated effort , almost relaxed . As if , Polly thought , everything were normal . He said : " Better than the Space Force , anyway . " Following the trail was slow , hard work from the start . Within the first hour the track of the enemy became blurred , but the robots worked tirelessly and it was not lost . Gradually the job became easier , the gradient of increasing density of certain battle remnants in the nebula becoming better and better defined . The speed of the chase increased until at last it began to seem possible that they would someday catch something  --  unless , of course , their prey were to increase its speed as well . The Pearl was already a billion kilometers into unmarked whiteness , far off such charts as existed for this portion of the nebula . Determining the location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a trivial problem . Even the brightest suns could no longer be located with any certainty amid the thickening , muffling clouds of white , off-white and gray , the ever-changing pastel shades of perpetual interstellar dawns and sunsets . It was not unheard of for ships to simply vanish  | in the Milkpail , even in regions where no berserker activity had ever been reported . There followed another blurring of the track , leading to a more prolonged slowdown . But this delay too was temporary , the trail firming again within a standard day . Time passed quickly , at least for Polly , working , sleeping , watching . People off duty still took time for conversation in the common room , watching the model transform itself . And Wilma and Simeon still thought aloud , at least in the captain 's absence , that the pursuit would ultimately prove hopeless . But within two more days it was unarguable that they were still following the berserker 's trail , and at an increasingly effective speed . The trail seemed fresher now , which meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been . That fact sank in . When the crew had begun this voyage , they had all still been in something of a state of shock . But by now that was wearing off . They had started to think about what they were doing : chasing a berserker . And the pursuit could no longer be considered hopeless . Polly began to wonder what would happen when and if they actually did catch up to the wounded thing they were pursuing . Certainly the Pearl was heavily armed and her crew capable . But still . Were they closing in on Old Blue ? Polly , like most colonists in the Milkpail , had heard the name many times , and some of the legendary stories . She had a healthy respect for berserkers , but like Commander Gennadius she had never considered one of them more terrible than another just because someone had given it a name . Now , though . . . there had been something disturbing about the jagged , illogicalseeming shape of Leviathan in the recordings and the theatrical blue glow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental effect of some kind of radiation . And as for the jagged form , who knew why berserker machines were sometimes built in one shape , sometimes in another ? Ran- domness , that was always said to be one of their important concepts .. . Whatever the reason for its peculiarities , it still seemed to Polly that one berserker , any berserker , just because it had acquired a name , ought not to be necessarily more frightening than another . Not that she had ever actually fought any of them , but . . . and whatever type of a machine it was that they were chasing , it was certain that it had already been seriously damaged ; and that was reassuring . Domingo had the six people of the crew divided into two watches now : three driving the ship , manning the weapons and studying the computer-modeled trail while the other three rested and slept and talked and waited for their turns on duty . In this way the hunt kept going hour after hour , one standard day after another . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the chiseling of his face grow sharper ; otherwise he seemed unaffected by lack of rest . The folds of nebula flowed ever more thickly around the Pearl . This did not slow the progress of the ship , already limited by the need to find a trail and stay with it . But it did raise the possibility of ambush . Gujar , operating the forward detectors on his watch , excitedly called in a sighting , and Iskander at the helm slowed forward progress . But the sighting proved to be a false alarm . When the object appeared at close range it was seen to be a peculiar thing , some kind of natural life-construct , with stalactite-like formations protruding from it in all directions . It throbbed , faintly and slowly , with the working of the life within it . Not a single organism , the instruments indicated , but some kind of a composite form . The thing , or creature , or life-swarm , or whatever it was , appeared next on the close forward detectors and finally on the direct-viewing screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only a few kilometers . It was vastly bigger than the ship . There was no indication that it was aware of the ship at all . Relative to the nebular material immediately surrounding  | it , the object was moving at a significant fraction of the velocity of light , a speed that any ship or machine of equal size would have found practically impossible to attain . No one on the ship had seen or even heard about anything like it before . At any other time the humans would have turned aside eagerly to investigate . But not now . When the living conglomerate was out of sight , Simeon and Wilma made a tentative and ill-advised attempt to persuade the captain to turn around and go back to Base Four Twenty-five . They argued and consider they had done a creditable job . Gennadius would thank them . Domingo did not thank them for the suggestion . The truth was that most of his crew , everyone but himself and Iskander , were growing increasingly uncomfortable in this weird place . Even to people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Milkpail Nebula , this thickening , curdling , mottled whiteness , engendering new monsters , was extraordinary . Among the uncomfortable majority the opinion was subtly gaining strength that it was , or ought to be , the job of the Space Force to carry on with this kind of pursuit . Domingo was inflexibly opposed to any change of course and overrode the hints of opposition . He even touched in passing on the laws of mutiny . In port a crew might , and his usually did , have the right to vote on big decisions . In deep space the captain 's word was law , and the law applied with redoubled force when the berserker enemy was near . The captain did agree to send off one of their two expensive robot couriers , directed to Base Four Twenty-five , before he continued his pursuit of the damaged berserker . The courier departed silently , carrying word of their discoveries , their present location and their intentions to Base Four Twenty-five . They hoped . The chance that it would succeed in getting there was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left aboard . Here in  | clouds where radio was hopeless , it represented the only possible means of communication with the rest of humanity . The pursuit of the wounded berserker resumed . More hours passed , adding up to another day . Tension grew aboard the ship as the trail became stronger , more clearly defined than it had ever been . Whatever was leaving the trail was undoubtedly closer ahead now than ever before . Sizable bits of debris , even fist-sized chunks of this and that , began to show up in the scans still being telemetered in from the outrider robots . " That 's berserker stuffing . " Domingo said it softly , with obvious enjoyment . A powerful blast centered somewhere ahead sent a silent but more-than-detectable shockwave through the white nebula . Chakuchin made a relieved sound . " It 's blown itself up . That 's it . " " We 'll see . " Domingo 's intensity did not alter . Inside the Pearl , whose forward velocity , even here within the buffeting whiteness , could be conveniently expressed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower shockwave could be studied on the detectors for some time before it engulfed the ship . But whatever might be , or might have been , at the center of the shock to cause it still could not be seen . Domingo ordered acceleration . And more acceleration . Particles of matter , molecule-sized , pinged dangerously against the shielding fields that so far were managing to protect the hull from microcollisions at relativistic speeds . Indicators glowed with warning signals . The captain ordered : " Give up the trail . Head for the center of that shock . " The location of the center could be determined from the automatic recording of the event . " Double alert for an ambush . Just in case . " On the screens of the forward detectors , the image of an object considerably bigger than the Pearl took shape and rapidly solidified . It was angular , irregular and metallic ,  | about at the upper limit of size for effective travel within the nebula . " Hold your fire ! " the captain ordered sharply . Whatever kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Leviathan . The shape was as jagged as Leviathan 's , but still totally wrong for that , if any of the descriptions and recordings of the monster were correct . Polly heard the captain sigh , a sound that might have come from the lips of a disappointed lover . The second most obvious characteristic of the object they had just caught up with was the remarkable amount of fresh damage that it had sustained . The ruin looked too genuine and extensive to be any kind of trick . As they approached the wreck ever more closely there was hard radiation , too , wild and irregular in both intensity and kind , but always enough of it to suggest that there might be a small-scale nuclear meltdown in progress somewhere on the enemy . It appeared that secondary explosions , delayed battle damage  --  or more likely a deliberate destructor charge , set off in anticipation of capture by the forces of life  --  had left this particular berserker unit , whatever it was exactly , drifting in a helpless condition . The humans aboard the Pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then from a hundred ; and then again from ten . Simeon said , with the air of someone trying to establish an assertion as undoubted fact : " Now we 've got to go back and report . " Polly , watching on her intercom , saw Niles Domingo 's eyes turn to the big young man , one image glaring at another . The captain squelched Chakuchin 's effort immediately : " We ca n't . We 'll lose it if we do . Do you expect that we , or anyone else , will be able to find the way back to it again in this fog ? " In another day or so the trail they had followed would have been completely dispersed by random drifting and other natural movements . There were currents in the  | nebula ; it was at least as dynamic as an ocean of water on the surface of a planet . " All right , then I suppose we finish it off . We have our missiles armed . " " They 'd better be . But do n't use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can we do ? " Chakuchin paused , as if realization had just come to him . " Are you expecting to send some of us over to board that thing ? It may just be waiting to use its main destructor charge until something living comes close enough to be wiped out in the blast . " " I think it 's already used whatever destructor charges it had left . And I 'll lead the boarding myself , if that 's what 's bothering you . Can I talk two other people into suiting up with me ? If not , I 'll go alone . Polly , what about you ? " The captain 's eyes looked out from the little intercom screen and into hers . " We could use your technical expertise . " " I 'll go , " Polly heard herself agree at once . Then she trembled , thinking of her children . But she could not unsay what she had said . Not to Niles Domingo . She could silently curse the unasked-for fate that bound her to him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed it had she had the power . Iskander , as usual , had not much to say , but he was plainly ready , even eager , to go where his captain led . Gujar repeated Simeon 's suggestion : " We could just fire away at it ... " But Domingo was silent this time , and this time the suggestion died without argument . The objections to it were too plain . Self-destruction was doubtless what the berserker had wanted to achieve , but something had gone wrong with the destructor charges . That it had tried to destroy itself when capture by its enemy seemed imminent at least suggested that there was still something aboard that might constitute a valuable secret , perhaps even a clue to where the berserkers attacking the Milkpail colonies had their repair and construction base . Conceivably there might even be human prisoners still  | living on that wreck . That there could be seemed doubtful , but berserkers did take prisoners sometimes for the information that could be gained from them , for living bodies and living minds on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , switching rapidly from one instrument of observation to another and back again . This was not Leviathan in front of him , but it represented the only immediate chance he had of getting closer to Leviathan . He mused aloud in his newly intense voice : " This is too damned strange . It 's not like any berserker I ever saw or heard of before now . We ca n't miss the chance , we 've got to go over there and see what we can find out from it . " Simeon suggested : " We 've still got one courier . Let 's send it off first , at least . Tell people where we are . Get some help out here . " lskander shook his head . " I do n't think so . If we launch our last robot courier here , we do n't know that it 's going to be able to find Base Four Twenty-five . Or that it 'll ever be picked up by the Space Force anywhere . I 'd say myself that the odds are pretty poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through . " He smiled faintly . " Besides , couriers are expensive . " It was the punch line of a standing joke . Gujar said : " I agree . We might need the courier worse later on . I 'd even say it 's chancy as to whether we 'll be able to find our way out of this ourselves ; at least in any comfortable period of time . " And Domingo again : " Maybe a courier would be able to find its way to the Space Force somewhere . And if it found them , they might not be too busy to come and look at this thing . And if they did decide to come , and they did find their way here and saw it , they might be smart enough to realize its value . Or they might not . No , thanks . We 're going to handle this ourselves . Even if they did agree it was valuable , they might still decide it would be better to fire away . " There was general agreement among the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , on the Space  | Force for their very lives . They also tended nc impressed with that organization 's abilities and acc Simeon wavered . " Well , if you put it th Wilma was silent . " I do put it that way . Let 's go . "  | Inside the cramped ventral bay where the Sirian Pearl carried her only launch  --  a small craft that also served as her only lifeboat  --  Niles Domingo , Polly Suslova and Iskander Baza were clambering into the bulbous suits and helmets of space armor . They were speeding up the procedure by calling checklist items back and forth . Polly saw Iskander watching her as if he found something very amusing in her way of managing the checklist . She gave him a sharp look in return , and he turned away . As soon as they had their suits on and tested , the three of them gathered up personal weapons and kits of tools and entered the launch , carefully maneuvering their mechanically enlarged bodies , one after another , through the tight hatchway of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as long as the Pearl herself but not much bigger in diameter than the height of a tall man . Its hatches were sealed now , and the bay around it evacuated . Then the ventral doors of the bay were  | opened to space . With Domingo in the pilot 's seat of the launch  --  his armored helmet had a built-in headlink  --  the small vehicle separated from the Pearl and drove toward the damaged berserker . Normally the controls of the launch , like those of the larger ship , were operated through a direct linkage to the electrical activity of the human pilot 's brain . The system used on the launch was less sophisticated than that aboard the Pearl , but adequate for the less complicated craft . One advantage of the launch was its real viewports , through which people inside could look out . In one direction , nearly astern now , hung the Pearl , her gun hatches open , her weapons ready . In almost the opposite direction , suspended against an endless background of distant white billows and luminous pastel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray planes and angles , torn by blackened holes , lighted from time to time by fitful internal fires  --  none of which were blue . The berserker was substantially bigger than the Pearl , and through the viewports it appeared subjectively enormous as the three humans in the launch got their first direct look at it . The enemy loomed even larger as Domingo drove closer . Still , the launch 's radar instruments assured its crew that the machine ahead was by no means of an unusual size for a berserker . It rotated slowly in the eternal sleet of this nebular space , spurting more fumes and debris from ragged , open wounds , emitting an occasional flare of light in one color or another . Polly , looking at the broken , uneven outline the berserker presented , decided that almost its entire outer hull was gone . And yet it had continued functioning , at least well enough to retreat this far after the battle . The enemy unit appeared to be taking no notice of the Pearl , or of the more closely approaching launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibly that last explosion , whose shockwave the Pearl 's instruments had detected at a distance , had originated in a successful destructor charge ,  | and the berserker 's electronic brain , or brains , with their possible secrets , had now been totally destroyed . Of course it was also possible that the enemy still had additional destructor charges aboard , only waiting to be set off . Or that it still possessed other weapons and was now aware of human presences nearby and was biding its time , calculating how to optimize the last chance it would ever have of carrying out its prime programmed directive . " Ever get this close to one of them before ? " Polly asked the question in a small voice and of no one in particular . Crew stations on the launch were not separated ; all three people aboard were riding in the same small compartment . The captain , seated at her elbow , was continuing to ease the launch nearer to the foe at a speed of only a few meters per second . Wordlessly Domingo shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time for questions now ; Polly bit her lip . " I was , once , " Iskander murmured . Polly turned her head and looked at him , but he was not looking at her , and he offered no details . The central thought in Domingo 's mind right now was that this was not Leviathan in front of him . Still , it was one of the enemy , the only one of the enemy that had yet come within his grasp . The sight of the ongoing damage aboard , the nuclear and chemical reactions eating away at it , offered him a definite , savage satisfaction . The feeling was mingled with an urgent worry that the information he had hoped to find here , the knowledge that would somehow give him an advantage , lead him to his true foe , was being destroyed before his eyes in the same fires . He willed the launch forward more quickly . The safety fields of his chair shielded him and his shipmates from even feeling the acceleration , but they all saw on instruments how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had to be emanating from somewhere within the enemy , grew stronger as they neared  | the hulk . Still the armored suits ought to be sufficient to shield them from the radiation when they went out as boarders , unless the flux should increase by a considerable factor even above its present level . They circled the enemy once in the launch , at a distance of no more than half a kilometer . Then Domingo drove his little craft closer again , slowing at the last moment , without warning taking them right inside the damaged hull , as Polly muffled a gasp . The launch entered the enemy 's hull through a great rent that had been torn either by some Space Force weapon or by a secondary explosion . The hole was so big that it seemed to Polly that half of the pastel sunset billows making up the nebular sky outside were still visible after they had entered . But she still found herself holding her breath , with the sensation that gigantic jaws were about to close on her and crush her . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowing metal were visible in every direction . When the glow of the hot metal was augmented by that from the nebula outside , there was enough light to keep the bowels of the berserker from being really dark . Not satisfied with this erratic illumination , Iskander sent searchlight beams stabbing out from the launch . The lights , playing back and forth at varying angles , revealed more twisted metal along with other objects , shapes and textures , some of which remained unidentifiable . At places inside the berserker , the continually outgassing fumes from internal damage were thick enough to interfere with vision , even with the launch 's searchlights on . Running one last time through- the operator 's checklist of her armored suit  --  quite unnecessarily , but it gave the mind something to do  --  Polly knew terror , remembered her children and asked herself why she was doing this . The answer to that question was not hard to find  --  Domingo had asked her to do it . But that answer , she reflected , was the kind that did you no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch was completely inside the berserker , their communications with the Pearl were almost entirely cut  | off . Radios stuttered and rasped with static . Domingo had been expecting this problem . He got around it by maneuvering the launch back to the lip of the wound through which they had entered the enemy 's carcass and pausing to set up a small robotic relay station there . He had to get out of the launch in his armored suit to do so . Waiting for him inside the launch , Polly and Iskander held their craft in position . They were too busy watching for signs of enemy activity to talk , beyond the minimum of necessary communication , or even to look at each other . But the metal body of the enemy around them , dead or dying , still had not reacted to their presence . Polly could begin to breathe again . The EVA lock cycled ; Domingo came back in . Sitting in the pilot 's seat again , the outer surface of his suit frosting over lightly with the cold it had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confirming for himself that communications had now been solidly reestablished . Next , driving the launch very slowly , he moved it deeper inside the largely hollow body of the enemy and with a magnetic grapple secured the prow of the small craft to a central projection within the ruin . Then Domingo once more unfastened himself from his seat and stood up , drifting . The artificial gravity in the launch had not been turned on , conserving that much power against sudden need . He said : " You both know what we 're looking for . Keep in contact with each other at all times . " " One more thing , " said Baza . " We 're locking up after us . Do n't want any mice getting in while we 're out . " Iskander grinned mirthlessly . " Hatch reentry code will be Baker Epsilon Pearl . Okay ? " The two people with him acknowledged the code . Now the three explorers were ready to begin serious investigation . Domingo disembarked first and looked around before the others came out . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small vessel , closed and sealed the hatch . Then the three separated , moving away from the launch in three different directions .  | On first touching the metal bones of the berserker , Polly could feel , through the gauntlets covering her hands , how those structural members quivered faintly with the ongoing throb of some machinery . Everything here was not totally dead . But the hulk seemed basically stable , and getting around inside it proved not to be difficult , at least at the start . When necessary the boarders used the small jets on their armored suits to maneuver . But most of the time , in the effective absence of gravity , they were able to scramble readily from one handhold or foothold to another . Each member of the party carried sample cases and nets , means of gathering samples of gas , of debris , of anything that looked like it might represent a clue as to the purpose of this huge construction . Repeatedly Domingo 's voice came on the suit radios of his two companions , urging them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible that secrets were being destroyed around them every minute . Polly wondered , but at this late juncture hesitated to ask , how they would be able to recognize a real secret when one appeared . Already Iskander was jabbing boldly with a long , telescoping staff at some wreckage near the launch . " Someone else ought to look at this , " he said on his suit radio . " This looks to me like biochemistry lab equipment . Maybe your hunch is right , Cap . About there being something here worth finding out . " Polly , pushing aside incomprehensible alien debris , went to join Baza . The stuff he was digging into looked to her like industrial equipment , pieces from some kind of factory . Domingo had started his own search some distance away . Over suit radio he informed the others that he had already come upon the remnants of similar equipment . The three of them , all keeping moving while they talked , discussed the situation with Simeon and Wilma and Gujar back aboard the Pearl . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctive decision to board the wreck might be justified .  | From the ship , Wilma 's voice came sharply , interrupting the discussion : " We 're starting to get some readings that indicate activity aboard that piece of junk . " The captain 's voice snapped back : " What sort of activity ? What do you mean ? " " It looks to me like physical movement . By objects approximately the size of people , making sudden starts and stops . It 's not you ; we can distinguish your movements from this other stuff . " The faces of Polly 's shipmates were hard for her to see inside their helmets . Domingo 's voice came calmly : " If there were any independently functioning , programmable machines still here , I think they would have let us know already . What you 're detecting might be drifting bits of stuff . " " Might be . It 's hard to read anything accurately under these conditions . But to be on the safe side maybe you 'd better get back to the launch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the safe side , anyway . We 're going on with what we 're doing . " Polly heard her captain 's fearless indifference , swallowed and went on with what he wanted her to do . Iskander naturally was doing likewise . The radio voice came again , relayed from the ship . " All right , acknowledge . We 'll continue to stand by . " The three people who were still aboard the Pearl would be ready to provide what help they could for the three boarders in case of trouble ; or , in the worst case , they ought to be able at least to get away with the ship and carry the news of a disaster . The people on the ship also had the task of recording data as it was transmitted from the trio of explorers . Exploration proceeded as rapidly as was feasible . Like her two companions , Polly jumped and jetted and clambered about the wreckage at a speed that she would have thought utterly reckless had it not seemed even greater folly to spend more time here than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not going to be able to explore the entire hulk . The explorers were undoubtedly accumulating a lot of raw information . How much usefulness that information had , if any , would have to be determined later . Hand-held video units recorded whatever passed in front of them . Faceplates in armored helmets expanded the spectrum in which the human eye could see , even as they protected the eyes from overloading brightness . Drifting and clambering through this ruin filled with disorienting shapes and unfamiliar objects , Domingo saw no recognizable weapons and no vast stores of power such as would have been required to energize most types of the spacewarfare weapons with which he was familiar . In this portion of the berserker too , some of the things he was finding looked like lab equipment . In fact , a lot of it looked like that . Yes , it had to be . But what was all the rest of this ? The components of a miniaturized factory for the production of some kind of biological materials , as Polly had already suggested ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet was that most of this was not weaponry , or direct support for weaponry , at least not any type with which he was familiar . He grew more certain of that the more he saw . There was no question that there had been some weapons on this thing once ; on a berserker there always were . But the armament , especially if it were limited in quantity , would have been mounted on or just inside the outer hull , and very little of that hull was left . He had n't yet taken a close look at the remnant of surface that still existed , thinking secrets more likely to be found inside . It was amazing that any machine , even a berserker , could have taken a beating like this and still function well enough to propel itself this far . The strength of malevolent purpose . . . He moved around a shattered bulkhead , finding his way into yet another bay . Here were massive cylindrical objects ?  | field generators , he thought , and of some complex kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create defensive fields or artificial gravity for human ship or inanimate killing machine . No , these were intended for something else ... and they were clustered together oddly , as if in an effort to produce some kind of heterodyning .. . And what had all this been , here , inside ? Tanks , pipes , equipment for doing something chemically . Producing something , in quantity , he supposed . Beyond that it was very hard to guess . The problem of determining functions was only partially a result of the extensive damage and the alien design . Difficulty also lay in the fact that there was simply too much volume here , too many things , too much material for three harried , frightened people to assimilate or even to record on video in any endurable length of time . Vibrations in the berserker 's framework had been perceptible to the explorers ever since they had left their launch . Now the rumbles and shudders were growing stronger and running almost continuously through the enemy 's metal bones , for all Domingo knew presaging another and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid part of the berserker , his grip was shaken . Instruments attached to the captain 's suit registered another increase in the flux of radiation . No one spoke up about the increase , but everyone must have made the same observation he had . The readings were still within tolerable limits for the suits , but Domingo feared that they were high enough to make it hard for his people to concentrate on the job at hand . The captain himself had no trouble concentrating . What he was doing was necessary . He looked around him , making an urgent effort to get some overall sense of where he was , to form a picture of what this entire structure must have been like before the Space Force weapons had blown half of it away . This unit did n't seem like a ship , in the sense of something built primarily for travel or combat . It was , to  | begin with , he thought , more like some kind of space station , built to stay more or less in one place , working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it that  --  was heavily compartmentalized , or at least it had been before it had been wrecked . The implication , as Domingo saw it , was that different experiments , or possibly different production lines , would have been going on in the separate compartments . He and the two people with him had as yet explored only a comparatively small portion of this unit . The whole berserker was perhaps twice the cross-section and eight or nine times the volume of the Pearl . But so far Domingo had seen no evidence that it had ever held any human prisoners . Not Earth-descended , not Carmpan , not of any of the other known themes among the several recognized varieties of living Galactic intelligence . There was no trace recognizable of the life-support systems that would have been necessary to keep such prisoners alive . Nor were there signs of any cells , rooms or passageways where living victims might once have been held . Nor even of anything that looked like animal cages . He called his two fellow explorers on radio and questioned them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cages ? " Polly asked . " Why should there be cages ? " " I do n't know . It seemed a possibility . " Iskander , drifting closer from a distance , had a comment . " It 's not a prison , not an ark and not a zoo . But it is some kind of developmental lab . I 'll bet my next chance to own a ship on that . " Domingo was keeping his hands busy while he conversed , putting fragments of drifting material into a sample case . He answered : " I do n't know that I 'd be willing to go that far . But this is certainly not a fighting unit . We 've been through enough of it now to be sure of that . " Iskander , hovering close to his captain in effective weightlessness , seemed to shrug inside his armor . " So far we 've given it a light once-over only . But I suppose you 're right , Cap . " " Assume I am correct . " Domingo snapped shut his sam- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a berserker raiding party ? " " Probably berserkers have their logistic problems , too . Maybe they 're moving their laboratory from one planetoid or system to another . . . how should I know ? " Polly put in : " I 've got a bigger question for both of you . Why are berserkers cultivating life ? Are they experimentally trying to produce new forms ? " In the reflected glow of the launch 's searchlights , she could see Domingo 's face inside his helmet ; the captain seemed to be staring at the question as if his life depended on it . At last he answered . " I do n't know . But it would be a good idea to find out . " He looked around at the other two , who at the moment were both close to him . " And meanwhile , while we 're sitting around thinking things over , it 'll be a good idea for us to continue to survive . I think we 've got enough information for a start . Let 's get ourselves back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision or hung back from its execution . And a moment after they had closed the hatch of the launch behind them , they were heading out of the berserker 's belly and back toward the Pearl .  | A matter of minutes later , the Pearl 's entire crew was safely back inside the ship , and the ship had been withdrawn to what Domingo considered a prudent distance , nearly a hundred kilometers from the drifting wreck . The captain called his crew into a conference . Everyone was wearing shipboard coveralls now , while out in the ventral bay three suits of space armor , along with the launch , were still undergoing a thorough precautionary sterilization . Some of the sample cases brought back to the Pearl had already been processed through the sickbay diagnostic machines , where they had been discovered to contain microbial cultures . Those cases had been resealed by remote control and were being saved in sickbay for further investigation when they could be taken to a real laboratory . Gujar said thoughtfully : " It 's really simple . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't intrinsically interested in science . " Domingo nodded . " Agreed . "  | " And producing new forms of life is against their basic programming , which is to kill . So if they 're experimenting with biology , producing some modified forms of life  --  that 's the suggestion , is n't it ? ? they have an overriding reason for doing so . It 's part of an effort to achieve some larger goal . " It was Wilma 's turn to nod . " Of course . And their goal is no doubt their usual one , of wiping out ED humanity . We 're their big stumbling block , probably all that stands in the way of their sterilizing the whole Galaxy . We have been , ever since they met us . " " Exactly . And so the most likely interpretation of all this bioresearch material is that it represents a serious attempt to produce  --  what ? An antihuman poison ? " Polly said : " There are a lot of poisons around already that can kill people . It would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I do n't think it 's that . But ... an antihuman something , certainly . Maybe a virus ? " The captain was thinking very intently . " Historically , down through the centuries , they 've already tried a number of times to use disease organisms against us . But that kind of tactic has never worked very well for them , as far as I know . People have been doing research on human diseases a lot longer than berserkers have ; we 're ahead , and we 're not about to let them catch up . " " But suppose they have caught up ? " Iskander wondered . He appeared to find possibilities of amusement in the idea . " Well , we can feed what information we 've been able to gather so far into the computer , along with that hypothesis , and see what we get . " Wilma and Simeon got started doing that while the others watched . Simeon was ready to continue the discussion as he worked . " I assume you 've all heard about the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows . " Do n't tell me they 're involved . " Chakuchin ignored that dry joke ; the Red Race , the berserkers ' original targets , had been dust and radiation as long  | as the Builders themselves or perhaps a short while longer . " Then no doubt you 've heard about the qwib-qwib too . " " Sure . So what ? " In that lost age , sometime before the beginning of ED history , the Builders ' opponents , with almost their dying effort , had constructed machines that were designed and built and programmed to do nothing but seek out and destroy berserkers . Or so went the theory most favored by present-day ED historians . Unfortunately for the Red Race and for Galactic life in general , the qwib-qwib machines had appeared on the scene too late to cope successfully with the berserkers . " Legendary , " said Iskander , smiling faintly . " Like Leviathan itself . " Domingo was not smiling . " But whether something is legendary or not is not the point . Simeon 's point , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing something analogous to what the Red Race did with machines . I mean they might now have turned to creating life  --  not necessarily just microbes  --  to wipe out life where other means have failed them . " For the next few seconds each of the six people thought her or his own thoughts in silence . Then their ship interrupted their meditations with a report . Their main onboard computer was ready to confirm that the material presented to it for analysis was almost certainly from some kind of facility engaged in biological research . But it was not prepared to deliver a quick estimate of the berserker 's probable purpose in working with such material . Instead the computer suggested that the job should be given to some larger computer , if the delay that would necessarily involve was tolerable . Domingo said to it harshly : " We 'll do that as soon as we have the chance ; for now , keep working . " The computer acknowledged the order with a simple beep ? the captain did not care for unnecessary anthropomorphism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polly , speculating on what she had seen today , remarked :  | " There may , of course , be other berserker space stations like this one somewhere . " " If the computer should ask me about that possibility , I 'll tell it so . " But the computer was silent on that point . What it did ask for presently was more information , in particular more samples of various materials from the wreck . " Such samples are difficult to obtain . What kind of answers can you give me without more data ? " " None reliable . " The voice of the machine was very clear and quite inhuman . " Keep working anyway . " The captain looked round him at his crew . " Second watch , back to your stations . First watch , take two hours at ease . " After his crew had dispersed , Domingo stayed in the common room alone , considering . He felt that events so far had justified his instinct . His intuition , hunch or whatever you wanted to call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him correctly , at least up to a point . His intuitive judgment now appeared to be backed up by the calculations of the ship 's computer . He had been led to something of great value . Now he was torn between wanting to return to the wreck and extract still more information from it and wanting also to hurry with the news of his discovery back to Base Four Twenty-five , where the information he already had gained might be used to forge a new weapon against Leviathan . In a way , he was still as far as ever from coming to grips with his chief enemy . But now one of its allies was here before him , helpless . For the moment at least , he held a once-in-a-lifetime advantage , and such an advantage must not be wasted . Finally Domingo decided to search the wreck some more . He could not shake the intuition that there was more to be gained from it ; and whatever information might still survive aboard it was being steadily incinerated . The Pearl was certainly not equipped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of collecting and preserving materials , including some probably dangerous items . But she had the space and the equipment to do a little more . And there was much more to be seen and photographed aboard the enemy , in limited time . If only the six humans on the scene now could find and salvage what absolutely must be preserved .. . Again Domingo called for volunteers . This time he wanted to bring four people , himself included , in the launch . Iskander as usual was the first to raise his hand , a languid , minimal gesture . This time Wilma and Gujar , evidently feeling it was their duty to accept a proper share of the risks , both volunteered to come along . That was enough to make four searchers . Polly kept her hand down on this occasion and stayed with Simeon aboard the Pearl . Neither she nor Chakuchin made any pretense of being at all eager to join the boarding party ; nor did Wilma appear surprised to see that her husband was staying behind . The Pearl once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same distance as on the previous effort . The launch , with the chosen four inside , cast off . When the boarding party reached the near vicinity of the berserker , they once more measured the radiation flux and reported that it had now fallen off a little . Domingo paused at the lip of the wound to check the communications relay , which was still in place and still working . Again the launch was maneuvered inside the berserker and moored there , in the same place as before . This time Wilma stayed in the pilot 's seat of the little vessel , ready to maneuver it close to any of the spacesuited searchers who might need assistance . The other three volunteers got out of the launch and separated , once more exploring individually . They reported that the rumbling and shuddering of the enemy 's frame , so pronounced earlier , had largely subsided . Polly , now in the pilot 's seat aboard the Pearl , had just received another call from the ship 's computer , which was protesting that it still lacked enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve . She had given the machine permission to reduce temporarily the amount of time it spent working on that problem . And now she was on her radio , listening intently to the conversation of the boarding party among themselves . " I do n't see anything more here than what you described , " Gujar was reporting via his suit radio . " I do n't ? " And that was the last that Polly heard . Communications had been broken off abruptly , dissolved in a sudden quavering whine of noise . " What 're you doing ? " Simeon 's figure , bulkier than ever in space armor , was unexpectedly looming at her side . He had come through the connecting tunnel from his own crew station . " What 's going on  --  Wilma ! " Even as he cried out his wife 's name , the Pearl was already shooting forward . " I 'm getting the ship over there ! " Polly shouted at him . " Get back to your station ! " His massive form hesitated . " Move it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Man our weapons ! " she shouted after Chakuchin 's retreating figure . Then she turned her full attention back to the controls and the radio . " Boards , can you read me ? Wilma , what 's going on ? " But as before , there-came no answer from suit radios or the launch . Headlink tight on her forehead , Polly gunned the drive , urging the Pearl to the assistance of the boarders . This was the first time , except for a couple of brief practice sessions , that she had flown this ship . She could only hope that her control was precise enough . Domingo 's first warning that something was gravely wrong came in the form of a stealthy movement that he happened to sight some forty meters away , clear on the other side of the ruined berserker . He thought the movement was too sharp and sudden to be that of any object merely adrift here in the  | effective absence of gravity ; it looked rather like a furtive , purposeful dart . A moment later , very near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , he was able to recognize the shape of a berserker android . The thing was approximately the size of a human being , and when he increased the magnification in his faceplate optics it showed up plainly . Silhouetted against a white patch of nebula framed by the ravaged hull , the machine looked half human and half insect . For an instant the dark inhuman shape was there and motionless ; then in the next instant it was not there , moving away again so quickly that it seemed to simply disappear . Drawing a breath , trying not to make a gasp that the radio would pick up , Domingo uttered the coded message that had been worked out for this eventuality : " I think I 'm beginning to see a pattern in this material here . " Chillingly , there was no immediate reply . There was only a faint whining nose in the captain 's helmet , so faint that until this moment it had not impressed itself upon his hearing . Now that he heard it , he was certain of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked out . Knowing his fellow boarders might already be dead , Domingo drew breath and shouted into his transmitter : " Berserkers ! Back to the launch ! " He had already drawn his handgun , a small but powerful projectile weapon , from his belt holster . The thoughtsight that would have made his aim with the handgun well-nigh perfect , guiding projectiles to his point of vision , was still clipped to his belt , and for the moment he left it there . The connectors on his helmet into which the sight would have to fit were presently occupied by the spectroscopic lenses , light amplifiers and sensors that he had wanted to have in place while he was searching . Domingo , drifting and nearly weightless , aimed his handgun as best he could by hand and eye and fired without benefit of thoughtsight . His aim was not bad , but far from perfect . In the quick serial flares made by the first burst of  | explosive projectiles , hitting home across the hull in airless silence , he could see the attacking berserker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway torn off by a half-lucky shot . Now it will know I 'm here and kill me , Domingo thought , but before his enemy could burn him out of existence he had time to fire again . Again he thought that he did damage , and again the instantly effective return fire that he had expected from the android did not come . So the device he had just shot at might be only an unarmed mobile repair machine  --  unarmed except for the strength in its limbs and tools , the machine-power quite probably capable of tearing an armored suit apart along with the man inside . Scrambling away in the opposite direction from his target , the captain got behind a bulkhead . Against a machine that had only its strength for a weapon , he might survive long enough to get his thoughtsight connected . Domingo continued to shout warnings into the unresponsive whining within his helmet as his feet thrust against broken machinery and structure to propel his body and his hands worked to get the weapon 's fire-control system attached to his helmet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the special search gear he had been using , letting the disconnected chunks of hardware go drifting free . Unexpectedly , the radio noise in his helmet changed , flowered into bursts of whining and singing that moved up and down the scale of audio frequencies . Maybe there was hope yet . The combat radio system built into the suits , technology borrowed from the Space Force , had detected jamming and was trying to fight through it , working to hold a signal pathway open . Domingo 's shouted warnings had brought no reply , and he could not assume that anyone had heard them . But the blasting flares of gunfire certainly ought to have served as an alarm , and so should the more subtle fact of the jamming itself . If only his crew had been quick enough to notice the  | jamming , and if any of them were still alive , to notice that the shooting had begun .. . The captain was drifting in shadow now ; his suit lights turned off , his hands still working to get his weapon ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take forever . Before the device was ready , his eyes caught another flash of movement in another place across the hull , far from where he thought either of his shipmates ought to be . Perhaps it was the same machine he had seen before and fired at . Perhaps at least one more enemy device was activated , ready to join in an attack . Domingo 's hopes surged up suddenly as he saw , near the same spot , the flares of projectiles from other handguns like his own , bursting and glowing and dying away . A moment later , he caught a glimpse of two suited human figures , together now and still surviving , scrambling in the direction of the place where the launch was moored . But still nothing except noise was coming through on his radio . Then something flared up brightly amid the wreckage where those last shots had struck , brighter by far than the explosive projectiles from the humans ' sidearms . It was perhaps a delayed , secondary explosion caused by one of the humans ' shots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enemy , a ruin almost swarming with their units . Some of the creeping machines Domingo saw were much smaller than humans , and individually these miniature units , probably repair or construction devices of some kind , looked ineffective . But they would all be equipped with potentially mangling tools of one kind or another . And it was evident that a berserker brain somewhere was still directing their activities . The launch was abruptly in motion now , its mooring cast off . Domingo thanked all the gods that Wilma must have realized what was happening . And now there was fire from the launch , almost invisible beams of energy from its one real weapon . The beams probed neatly and precisely among the ruins , and small moving machines touched by that vague  | thin pencil flared up and vanished . Wilma , alone in the launch , had turned her attention from piloting and was cutting some of the enemy down . The launch was hovering now in the middle of the hollow space inside the berserker , standing by to help the boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , here in virtual weightlessness , for them to jump for it . The captain would n't be first to jump ; he 'd see his people on board first safely , if they were still alive ; and before going to them he wanted to get the thoughtsight connected .. . Of course , the launch . Of course , that was what the enemy was after . The captain could n't see the Pearl itself from where he drifted inside the carcass of his enemy . Nor could he guess what action Polly and Simeon might be taking . By now , if they were still alive , they must have realized that radio signals from inside the berserker were being jammed , and probably they could see the intermittent flares of fighting . If Simeon and Polly were to open up with the heavy weapons that the ship carried , the most likely effect would be the annihilation of everything that still remained of the wrecked berserker , along with the four people who were inside it and the launch that had brought them here . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Now the noise level in the captain 's helmet radio suddenly dropped . Hoping that the built-in combat anti-jamming might now be able to force a signal through , Domingo shouted orders for the Pearl to stay clear of the wreck . He did n't know what additional weapons the enemy might still be able to bring into play , but if berserker units could seize the launch and then the Pearl , much more than this one skirmish would be lost . Still no answer came to him from the Pearl . It was quite likely that the relay station had been knocked out . Surely the people aboard his ship must realize by now that something was wrong . If only they did n't do anything that  | might endanger the ship , put it at risk of being boarded , taken over Domingo got confirmation that Polly and Simeon were at least aware of a problem . Now he could see the Pearl herself , hovering close outside the gap through which the launch had entered the berserker . But the radio jamming had come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a minute had passed since the first alarm . Moving around within the wreck , still struggling to get the last connector of his thoughtsight properly attached , the captain could see that the relay communications station , on the lip of the berserker 's wound , was gone . It had somehow been knocked out , quite possibly uprooted by a berserker android by main strength . Then without warning a voice burst through the jamming into his helmet . Score one round at least for the Space Force technology ; even the stereo effect worked . The message was a shout of fresh alarm that turned the captain in another direction : " They 're trying to seize the launch ! " I know that , damn it , thought Domingo , and repeated an order that had earlier gone unacknowledged . " Wilma , keep it away ! " The jamming came back , cutting him off in midsentence . But Wilma , whether she had heard him or not , kept on with what Me was doing , maneuvering the launch close to an interior landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually , Domingo realized , she was bringing it closer to where he himself had been a few seconds ago , as if she thought he needed to be picked up . She would be able to see , though perhaps only intermittently , where the people inside were . She was naturally trying to rescue them , get them out of this snakepit of swarming enemies . And she had stopped shooting for the moment . To fly the launch , determine where to go and at the same time work its weapon precisely was more than almost any individual would be able to manage properly . The captain gave up trying to be last aboard and propelled  | himself into a weightless dive to meet the approaching launch . At the same time , with inhuman speed , berserkers went jetting and lunging for the small craft as it appeared about to touch down . Domingo 's weapon blazed at them . His shots were still hand-aimed , but lucky enough to reduce a couple of small units to flying fragments . The recoil of his own fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed at more wreckage to stop himself . Why did n't they jump us the first time we came aboard ? If ever he had time to think again , he might be able to come up with a sure answer for that one . Probably the enemy had needed some time to mobilize its mobile units . Or else , on the humans ' previous visit , the malevolent computer planning the attack had simply delayed its move too long , miscalculating the moment when the onslaught of its small machines would be most likely to inflict maximum damage . Probably the prime enemy objective from the start had been to seize the launch . At last , under the pressure of Domingo 's fingers , the final stubborn connector clicked into place ; the thoughtsight was installed on his helmet . He brought his weapon into efficient operation now , locking aim and firing with fearful electronic accuracy ; one of the scurrying machines after another vanished in blurs of flying parts . Now that his fire was seriously disrupting their coordinated attack , he suddenly became the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a toolrack charging at him and sent it spinning and reeling away , with a great hole blasted through its middle . He got a new clip into his handgun barely in time as an android charged him , hurling something that clanged like a bullet off his armor . That machine , too , he promptly devastated . To Domingo it seemed that he broadcast and focused destruction with the mere act of his will . But there was only one more spare clip before his ammunition would be gone . The return fire he had expected earlier struck at him now ; some kind of laser , he thought , but not quite powerful enough  | to do the job . Domingo was left momentarily blinded , trying to tumble away . Even through his armor he could feel the searing heat . The two other humans who had boarded the wreck with him had given up trying to hide . They were using their weapons steadily now , and more or less efficiently . As far as Domingo could tell , their efforts were no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble getting their thoughtsights hooked up , too . Only the weapons on the launch itself , now briefly back in action again , were so far staving off disaster . Iskander and Gujar jumped for the launch , propelling themselves easily in weightlessness , and one of them at least ? Domingo could n't see the suit markings to determine which ? was clinging to it , gripping a small projection with one hand and firing a weapon with the other . Wilma opened the hatch of the launch , responding to frantic gestures from one of the other boarders who was closely beset by machines . The trouble was that as soon as the hatch was opened , the enemy went for it . It was naturally a double door , inner and outer , the EVA airlock . The idea came to Domingo that the enemy were using the boarders as bait rather than going all out to kill them quickly , hoping to be able to lure the launch within easy reach to get it to open its entry hatch . On the launch , Wilma could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy machines , in peril of being scraped off the launch and grappled by them . The launch , unless she were to withdraw it from inside the berserker , remained within easy leaping distance of the surviving androids . And the humans ' communications were still being successfully jammed . Domingo went after the enemy machine that was closest to the launch . Maybe one of the same kind that killed Maymyo , he thought . He fired and fired at it , bathed it in explosions , but could not seem to do it any effective harm . It had some  | special , toughened armor . His small handgun projectiles were not enough . It had no firing weapon of its own but was destroying things by main strength . It somehow disabled the beam projector on the launch . Now it wanted to get at the opening hatchway on the launch . Domingo was there in time to somehow block its entry or to keep it from getting through the inner door of the EVA hatch . The launch started to drift away , uncontrolled , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the door closed again . The thing was close in front of him , parts of it blurring with movement at invisible speed , a chopping machine into which he was about to be fed like sausage . Domingo and the berserker both spun away from the launch . Wilma , trying to reach from inside to help , was drawn out with them , but either Gujar or Iskander lunged into the open airlock and got it closed again from the inside , just ahead of the reaching grapple of a machine . Then he , Domingo , was wedged in a crevice somewhere and the berserker android was pounding at him , probing for him with a long metal beam . The weapon driven by those arms could mash him , armor and all , if it caught him solidly and repeatedly , wedged against an anvil as he was . Domingo was not trying to get away any longer ; he was as well-armed now for this fight as he was ever going to be , and he was fighting . Domingo could feel himself being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon one more time , pointblank range against the damnable , the evil thing .  | There was a time , a long , long time , during which his awareness of his surroundings was no more than barely sufficient to convince him that he was not dead . Dead , slaughtered and gone to one of the legendary hells , one that had been re-created especially for him and repopulated with berserkers . Down there the damned machines were still killing Isabel and the children , and he still had to watch . Then , subtly , a divide was crossed down near the boundary of hell , and Domingo began to be sure that it was human beings and not only machines who had him in their care , though the gods of all space knew there were machines enough surrounding him . He allowed himself to be convinced that these contrivances were purely benevolent , or at least that was the intention of their programming . He had not become the berserkers ' prisoner . Lying there with his life no more than a thin bloody thread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmish with the damned killers . But all the details of the event were  | vague . He had gone after them somewhere , and a fight had broken out  --  yes , inside their wrecked , spacegoing laboratory ? and he had been terribly hurt , though now he was suffering no particular pain . Nothing else about what had happened was at all clear at the moment . The thread of life was stronger now . The present , if not the past , was growing a little clearer . Domingo understood that he was lying flat in a bed , on his back most of the time , though once in a while he was gently flipped , for one reason or another . He realized too that there were people coming and going purposefully around him . As a rule the trusty caretaking machines stayed where they were . He had the feeling that the lenses and sensors of these machines were watching him with superhuman vigilance . Sometimes Domingo thought that his left leg was no longer where it ought to be , that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip , sprouting grotesquely from his back or chest . And sometimes he thought that the leg was completely gone . Not that the mere absence of one limb was going to worry him especially . He was still breathing , and the berserkers did not have him . Those were the only two essential requirements of life that he could think of . Given those two conditions , he would be able to build on them everything else he wanted . His wants were really simple , though they were not easy . Grimly , half blindly , half consciously , he started trying to make plans again . In time he could and would find the way to the appointed meeting that he was fated to have with Leviathan . That meeting would take place . He would create a way , a possibility , if none existed now . More time , long days , passed before Domingo experienced an interval in which he was strong and lucid enough to ask questions . His voice at first was no more than a crushed whisper . " What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was the first thing Domingo asked about ; and Polly  | Suslova , wild-haired as usual and looking somewhat excited as she bent over him , was the first person he recognized and the first to whom he spoke coherently . Polly 's answer was given in soothing tones , in contrast to Ill her appearance . The only trouble was that the answer was not , as he saw it , very much to the point : " You 've been hurt , Niles . You 'll be all right now , though . " And suddenly she turned away , reacting as if she were terribly upset by something . The second statement in her reply , he felt sure on interior evidence , was still problematical ; as for the first statement , he had already figured that out for himself without help . With li his memory slowly improving , he could recall something but not everything about the firefight inside the wreck and that last berserker android . He had at last begun to hurt , and in a number of places . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenses , and listened continuously to his breathing and his heartbeat , and probed his veins and nerves , and kept the pain from ever getting too bad . He accepted the pain as a sign of his recovery . The captain never had the least doubt that his recovery was desirable and necessary . Because he had to get well and strong before he could go after Leviathan again . And still more time passed before Domingo was able to determine that the hospital in which he was recovering must be the military one on Base Four Twenty-five . At about the same time as he understood where he was , Domingo comprehended also that Polly Suslova , more often than not , was still nearby . Like skillfully arranged background music , she had been with him for some time before he recognized her presence , before he was able to ask her those first questions . In fact , it now seemed to Domingo , once more able to think in terms of time and space , that Polly had been more or less in attendance on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he thought about it , before that . For a long time now , ever since the captain had started to regain consciousness , people had been pausing beside him and trying to tell him things , mostly reassuring platitudes about his medical condition . Facts were in short supply . But now , in a strengthening voice , he was able to ask more questions . From Polly , from the medical people , from Iskander who came in often and from Gujar who came in once to visit him , Domingo learned , a little at a time , the details he was unable to remember of what had happened to him and the others who had been examining the wrecked berserker . He learned how , after the small commensal berserkers had struck him down , his crew had managed to crunch the enemy 's attacking mobile units , down to the last machine . And how his crew had then got themselves and Domingo and the Pearl away from the scene of the battle . By the time they did that their captain had been totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space armor . They had needed power tools to get him out of the mangled armor , and he had made most of the trip back to base in suspended animation in the Pearl 's sick bay , surrounded by deep-frozen sample cases holding biological samples gathered from the wreck . Now in the hospital , Domingo was pleased , he was even more elated than was reasonable , to learn that they had brought back what the Space Force analysts were calling a large amount of very valuable samples and recorded information . Iskander had even managed to bring along the demolished fragments of one of the berserker androids . When Polly saw how greatly this news delighted the captain , she went over it again , telling him in considerable detail how successful their effort had been and how Baza had insisted on salvaging parts of the vanquished enemy for later study . When Domingo grew tired , Polly went away to let him rest after assuring him that she 'd be back . He was glad to hear that she intended to return , but somehow he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to come and go around him , all of them being professionally cheerful . Domingo slept again , this time with conscious confidence that he was going to wake up . Next time he awoke , he was able to take a steadier notice of his surroundings . He observed that the base hospital was an alert and ready place , but not a very busy one . This hospital had almost certainly never been used to anything like full capacity , even for the casualties of war ; and it was not being so used now . In the war against the berserkers there were plenty of human dead , but not that many wounded . And fortunately , wars like those on ancient Earth , of life pitted against life , were virtually unknown . Again Domingo probed with questions at the people around him . This time he wanted to know if his crew had gone back to the wrecked berserker after the fight and gathered still more information . None of the hospital staff knew the answer to that one , or wanted to discuss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that the answer was important , bearing as it did on the reliability and dedication of the people in his crew . The answer , unhappily , was no . Domingo raged feebly at Iskander when he heard that . And raged again when he was told something he was later able to confirm for himself on the recordings : The main berserker , the damaged hulk , had not , even yet , been totally destroyed . The crew of the Pearl , once their captain was unconscious , had not stayed in the area even long enough to finish the helpless enemy off . Iskander raised an eyebrow and accepted the rebuke tolerantly . " Sorry , Niles . " " Sorry . That does n't help . " " It 's done now . There 's no reaction I can demonstrate that will help now , is there ? " No , there was n't . Gujar Sidoruk , making his second visit to Domingo in the hospital , assured him : " That piece of junk could n't hurt  | anyone any longer , Niles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chances against that are ? " Domingo made a disgusted noise . It was a surprisingly loud noise , considering his condition . Iskander said soothingly : " It 'll just lie there helpless , Niles , until its power fails eventually and it rots . No one 's going to stumble onto it . Not there . " The captain 's voice was weak , but still it was hoarse and harsh . " There 's life out there in the nebula . It 'll go on killing that . It 'll figure out some way to use whatever systems and power it has left , and it 'll kill a little more at least . " His visitors of the day looked at one another , a look that said the captain was still woozy from all that had happened to him . In the Milkpail there were cubic light-years of that kind of tenuous life around . It was scattered everywhere in the nebula . And aside from harvesting certain of its odd varieties and some useful byproducts , nobody gave a damn about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of life , of course , en passant when they encountered it  --  they were programmed to kill everything  --  but their main destructive interest was concentrated upon humanity . In the whole Galaxy so far , only intelligent life , synonymous with humanity in its several themes , appeared to offer any serious obstacle to the machines ' achievement of their projected goal , the ultimate sterilization of the universe . Gennadius , himself looking a little less grim than the last time the two had met , came to look in on the grim patient . The base commander reported , among other things , that the robot courier that had been dispatched to Four Twenty-five from the Pearl had never reached the base . " To nobody 's particular surprise , " Domingo whispered . " I suppose so . " " Are you hunting Leviathan now ? " " We 're doing what we can , Niles . We 're doing what we can . " Gennadius could also offer Domingo reassurance of a sort on one point . Following the Pearl 's return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted  | fact , or guessed it  --  that last fight was gradually becoming I ! less of a blank to him . But he had not much feeling left for Wilma , dead or alive . Or for any of the others . He was still anesthetized by earlier and harder shocks . He knew regret at the news , but only numbly , and largely because Wilma was going to be hard to replace on the crew . More time passed in the hospital . Day by day Domingo gradually improved , but it was obvious even to him that full recovery was still a long way off . His left leg was really gone , for one thing , almost to the hip . And that was far from being his only medical problem . He admitted , with his new habit of absorption in grim calculation , that his recovery , the first step toward revenge , was going to be even a bigger job than he had thought . At least while he worked at recovering , he could also make plans . With growing competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin by seriously taking stock of his own body . Or what was left of it . Regaining anything like full normal function was going to take him even longer than he 'd thought . The doctors told him that yes , they were going to have to fit him with a new left leg , some kind of artificial construction . Regrowth , the usual tactic employed when a limb was lost , did n't look promising in his current general condition , considering , as the doctors said , the overall neurological situation . When Domingo heard of the plans to fit him with an artificial leg , an inspiration came to him at once . The more he thought about his idea , the more he grinned . Naturally the people who were around him every day , who had n't seen him grinning at anything since his daughter perished , asked him what was up . He inquired about the berserker android that had been brought back piecemeal from inside the ruined enemy . Yes , it was still here on the base . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing really new about it . Then he told the doctors and therapists that he wanted to  | have one of the legs of the berserker android , or suitable portions of such a leg , adapted to his body . They looked at each other and decided to come back and talk to the captain about it later . Some of them looked shocked , or taken aback , but actually one of the doctors was intrigued by the idea . When Polly heard about it , she thought it was a little sick  --  maybe more than a little  --  and at her first opportunity she said as much to Domingo . At first he only grinned at her . " Why not ? " " If you have to ask ... " His expression became more intent , almost hostile . " Why not ? Why should n't I walk on one of their bones ? " Then abruptly his weakness showed . Polly felt guilty . " No reason , I suppose . You 're entitled to do what you want . " Then she changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Yirrkala and stay there while he recuperated . " I 'm going there for a while anyway , " she announced , trying to sound as casual as possible . " I 'm ready for a rest . I thought you might be , too . " Domingo thanked her , and agreed almost immediately . He could see that his quick acceptance surprised Polly somewhat . But he could see also that she was pleased . And he was exhausted . He had to save his strength for the arguments and fights that counted . He was a very long way from being ready to jump into a ship again and resume the hunt . He had to recuperate somewhere , before he could do anything else . And he wanted to do as much of his convalescing as possible out from under the supervision of the Space Force . They would n't be likely to go along with certain of the preparations he intended to make for the next round of his battle . The next time Polly came to visit him , Domingo asked her about Yirrkala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually talking to her about those things before  --  in what now seemed to have been an earlier life ? but the situation could have changed . Her home on Yirrkala interested him now , because he wanted to make sure it would  | provide an environment that made for speedy convalescence . From all he could find out , it sounded acceptable . His own homeworld was gone , and he considered it unlikely that anyone was going to make him a better offer . Presently Domingo was pronounced well enough for Polly to take him off to her own colony-home , and the two of them got on the first ship headed that way . Yirrkala was as well defended from berserkers as any place in the Milkpail , probably in the whole Sector . There Polly intended to nurse him back to the beginning of fitness ; and she intended to do more than that , though she did not discuss all of her intentions with anyone . Her private hope was to wean Domingo from the madness of revenge on clanking metal . She could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree that was at best unhealthy . She thought the problem ought n't to be hard to see for anyone who really looked at him or listened to him snarling at the ineptness of his crew . Maybe they had been inept ; it was the way he snarled . Some kind of unhealthiness was festering . But when she had tentatively mentioned the subject to the doctors , they told her that the patient was really doing quite well mentally , considering all-he had been through . Psychotherapy , if indicated at all , could and should wait until later . Right now full physical recovery was the chief concern in the captain 's case . Domingo said to her , just once , as they were getting ready to leave for Yirrkala : " Thank you . For taking care of me like this . " She tried to make little of it . " All part of the job . " " It 's not . I do thank you . "  | Almost everyone who knew anything about the subject considered Yirrkala to be the most livable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger and slightly more Earthlike world than any of the nebula 's other inhabited rocks , with enough natural gravity of its own to hold an atmosphere . The air enclosing its rugged surface had only to be augmented with oxygen , the mixture adjusted and not built up from scratch , to make it breathable , even at certain times and seasons comfortable . Surface temperatures could be mild on Yirrkala ; genengineered fruits and flowers were commonly grown outdoors . And since the gravity had been artificially augmented , there were even sizable bodies of fresh water , on and just below the Yirrkalan surface . Polly 's homeworld was also considerably closer to Base Four Twenty-Five than were most of the other colonies . Therefore it was less susceptible  --  both in theory and historically  --  to berserker attack . Still the Yirrkalans , not content to rely on the Space Force , had never skimped on their ground  | defenses ; and now even these already formidable installations were being hastily improved to counter the improvement recently evident in the berserkers ' weaponry . All in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as human existence in the Milkpail ever had , which was at best considerable . Domingo , disembarking on a robotic stretcher from the newly landed ship with Polly walking at his side , could see , beyond the glass walls of the port , a near horizon of pleasant hills , under a whitish sky mottled with many colors , predominantly blue . The captain 's battered body was swathed in blankets as he came rolling off the ship , but the air he could feel on his face was almost comfortably warm . The distant white giant sun of this system was hidden in nebular clouds , but its light came filtering through the sky to make an indirect judgment upon this little world , touching all its surfaces with ghostly frost . Vineyards and floral gardens covered most of the land that the newly arrived patient was able to see on his first look around outside the surface spaceport . In the direction where the horizon looked most distant there were ranks of the familiar screens and diffraction filters used as life-collection machinery , the same kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here come my people now , " said Polly cheerfully . Domingo looked down past his foot . Two figures that had to be Polly 's sister and brother-in-law , Irina and Casper , were on hand , wrapped in coats of synthetic fur , to meet the travelers just outside the port . Irina resembled her husband more than she did Polly , being somewhat plump and with a placid air about her . She and Casper had with them Polly 's two children , who immediately claimed most of their mother 's attention . The children were a boy and a girl , Ferdy and Agnes , about six and eight years old respectively , if Domingo remembered how to judge . He thought that neither of the kids looked much like their mother . Judging from the violence of the greeting they gave her , there was no doubt that they  | remembered who she was . Both children stared at Domingo with grave eyes , then looked away again , appearing to be impressed with their first sight of him on his robotic stretcher ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt and uncle were polite enough on being introduced , but not so much impressed . He smiled at all of them as best he could and said hello , wanting to prepare for himself the smoothest possible environment in which to get on with the business of his recovery . The stretcher 's wheels hissed faintly on the ramp bringing him down and away from the spaceport . Casper and Irina walking near him made friendly conversation , but still they seemed somewhat ill at ease . They all rode in a private groundvan  --  a rented vehicle that could hold the stretcher  --  through streets lined with genengineered trees that made the scene look like pictures from old Earth . This was a bigger world than Shubra , but still most of humanity would have thought it very small . Polly 's small house was out on the far edge of the settlement , but driving to it at moderate speed took much less than an hour . Most of the way they traveled through flower gardens and banks of life-collecting machines . The machines held up fine grids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came down out of the nebula , out of the sky . The little two-story house , set in its own hectare of grounds , was somehow different from what Domingo had anticipated , though he could not have said just what he had been expecting . The little dwelling had been unoccupied for some time , they said , but Casper and Irina had been busy getting it ready for Polly 's arrival and of course Domingo 's , too . Polly and her patient moved into the house at once , along with Polly 's children . The appearance , Domingo realized , was that he had acquired an instant family . But there were n't any neighbors close enough to be misled by appearances . His stretcher was guided into a small bedroom on the ground floor , next to Polly 's room , as she explained . The kids ' rooms were upstairs  --  Agnes and Ferd were evidently  | not used to a two-story house , and the mere idea of being upstairs was enough to enchant them . Domingo rested on his stretcher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people took care of the moving in . Not that there was very much to be done . On the day of his arrival on Yirrkala he was capable of dragging himself from stretcher to bed and back again , and of using his best hand to feed himself with only a minimum of human or robotic help , but that was about the extent of what he could manage . He had his room to himself at night ? except for occasional look-in visits from Polly the nurse who slept next door  --  and from the start he often took his meals alone . The first days of his stay passed uneventfully . The kids banged around in rooms nearby , upstairs and downstairs , or outside in their fur coats and caps , rollicking in the everghostly light . Sometimes the young ones yelled , in anger at each other or just in celebration of life . They were on some kind of school holiday , Domingo gathered , and so around the house most of the time . Every once in a while their mother murmured them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took stronger measures to see that the patient was n't disturbed unduly . But the patient assured her that the noises of life really did n't bother him . He even understood why they did n't bother him . It was because life , as life , no longer meant anything to him , one way or the other . Domingo did n't bother to bring that insight to Polly 's attention , but perhaps she sensed it anyway . His appetite was no problem , not from the time that he was strong enough to chew . His teeth were still in good shape . He did n't much care what he ate , food was food , strengthening the body for its remaining purpose . On Yirrkala his devoted nurse saw to it that he got good food , and on Yirrkala he ate well from the start and grew in strength . Faithfully the captain performed his prescribed exercises , some of them with the special robot that had been shipped to him for the purpose . The thing had arms and grips sticking  | out all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own equipment . Some of the exercises he did with Polly , who took the opportunity to try to psychologize him and to find out how determined he still was to go after Leviathan . He was still determined . She was obviously much concerned about his welfare , his mental and emotional health . Too bad for her , Domingo thought in silence . Casper and Irina lived at some little distance , or said they did , and so they came to visit only occasionally . On their visits they smiled at Domingo and chatted with him , but he could tell that in general they disapproved of his presence in Polly 's house , and especially in Polly 's life . That was all right with him . He did n't say so , but he meant to be gone from both as soon as he possibly could . Still , there were moments when Domingo was almost tempted to dream about what life might be like if it were possible for him to stay here with Polly and her family . Almost tempted , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the stillborn dream was pointless , it had no conclusion , and seemed unlikely ever to develop one . And even this faint inclination to dream of the impossible , such as it was , faded as his strength and mobility returned . A standard month after Domingo 's arrival on Yirrkala , his weight was already approaching normal again , allowing for the subtracted limb . The robotic stretcher had already been abandoned in favor of a semirobotic wheelchair , in which he could get around pretty much by himself . Both of his arms were working adequately now , but he was still a one-legged man  --  the prosthesis was going to be installed later , back at the base hospital . The children , in free moments between sessions of play and the occasional jobs their mother thought up for them , had shown a continuing interest in various stages of his progress . He was still popular with Ferd and Agnes , and he was n't sure just why . Neither of them spent that much time actually in his presence . Maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain if he had any kids of his own at home . He told her no , not any more he did n't , and at that point had provided some distraction and she had let it go at that . Able to stand up at last , lurching and crutching his way across the room on one foot to get his first really good close look at himself in the mirror since his injury , Domingo was struck by how different his face appeared from the last time he could remember seeing it . He stared into the optical glass , wondering at himself . Not so much at the gross physical scars and alterations , though those were certainly great enough . The most noticeable of them in the mirror now , aside from the missing leg , was a twisty scar , not yet fully obliterated by the surgeon 's art , that wound down one side of his jaw and neck and into his collar . The scar ended a little below that , fading indeterminately into his shoulder . But he thought his face showed greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were pretty much back where they were supposed to be . Alterations deeper than that , greater even than the missing leg , had taken place , molding him into someone he did not understand . He was still pondering when , beside his own face in the mirror , he caught a glimpse of Polly passing the open doorway of his room . The house was always kept quite warm , for his benefit , he supposed , and she was wearing almost nothing today as she moved about overseeing the machinery that did the housework . She looked just as she had when Domingo had first met her : compactly built , agile and shapely ; an attractive young woman . Domingo was aware of her attractiveness , but only in an abstract way . She had no regular man , as far as he could tell , at least she never spoke of one . And she was drawn to Domingo . He knew that too , he could remember it as from an earlier life , and he could feel it now . Sometimes it bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , that her investment in him was going to repay her nothing . Or at least he felt it ought to bother him .  | But the feeling of vague guilt never lasted for long . Nor did he spend much time considering his failure to understand himself , to relate himself as he was now to the man he used to be . Actually he had little time to worry about those things , because they were basically unessential . Because there was something else that demanded almost all his thought and energy , something that he had to do . Still  --  Polly and her children . They gave his mind a place to rest from planning , the only place it had . They provided something of a ready-made family , or the appearance of one , at least . But the sight of the little girl , especially , reminded Domingo painfully of his own daughters . As for Polly herself . . . Domingo had not really thought at all about women , as women , since well before the berserker mangled his body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His body was functional now , his physical strength was gradually returning , but he still had no urge to think of Polly , or anyone else , in that way . Still looking into the mirror , Domingo found himself keeping a wary eye on the robot exercise machine that was waiting behind him . It was , or ought to be , a comical-looking device , with the gymnastic tools protruding from it everywhere . Polly made jokes about it sometimes , and he smiled to be sociable . But it had never struck him as amusing . It would be a while yet , he supposed , before he could feel at ease in the presence of any smart machine . That was one of the things he was going to have to train himself to do before he got back into his ship . His ship was a machine too , and he was going to have to use it . Yes , in the mirror his face looked different . The captain began to get out of the house on milder days , when real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white glowing sky . Then one day the four of them , he and Polly and the two kids , took off on the Yirrkalan version of a summer outing . They went as far as getting into a boat , going  | for a cruise on one of the small outdoor bodies of open water . Domingo 's wheelchair wore a flotation collar , just in case . From the boat , cruising through the fantastic rock grottoes that edged the convoluted pond , they looked at a profusion of marvelous floating flowers . They stared at fighting flowers , plants that grappled with one another in slow motion and tried to drown one another 's floating pads . They talked about what life was and speculated , half playfully , on what gods there really were . At least Polly speculated , and tried to get Domingo to do so , too . The children had a couple of ideas to contribute , but mainly they were obsessed with tossing pebbles . Neither did the captain have much to say to advance the discussion . All Domingo could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal , trimmed here and there with blue flames . That and dirty fragments of a white dress . There were genengineered fish , too , in this Yirrkalan pond , the biggest of them strange silvery harmless monsters , long as a man 's arm , that went gliding about in the cold , almost murky depths . If you could really call these depths , two or three meters at the most . The kids had somehow developed a scary legend of the deepest part of the pond , and they took turns relating it and elaborating on it . A big fish lived down there under a gloomy shelf of rock , a fish bigger than any of the others .. . " And , and , you know what his name is , Uncle Niles ? " Child-eyes growing wide with excitement . With fear , was more like it . " I know . I know that , yes . " The answer did n't have a chance , because again there was a timely distraction from a sibling . No one in this world or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final answers . A little later , feeling sorry for his nurse and wanting to be reassuring , he said banally : " This is a nice world , Polly . " Impulsively though still quietly , she burst out : " Stay here . Stay with us . " Then she looked as if she were afraid her words might scare him off .  | All he could say was something noncommittal ; then those words of his own sounded so bad he wished he could have them back , too . But they were gone . An hour or so later , having regained the ability to chat inconsequentially  --  the children practically enforced that  --  they came back to the house . Berserkers were for the moment as close to being forgotten as they could be . An unfamiliar groundcar was parked in front of the house , and a man was waiting in it . A bulky figure got out of the groundcar as Polly 's vehicle pulled up . Gujar Sidoruk had come to Yirrkala for a visit and was waiting to see them  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem changed at all . " You 're looking good , Niles . Real good . " " Considering . " " No , I mean it . Real good . Well , yeah , of course , considering everything . " Presently the two men were sitting in the house and talking ; Polly 's children demanded her immediate attention . Gujar began telling the captain about the state of his , Gujar 's , feelings . He was still grieving for Maymyo and for everyone else the machines had slaughtered . He still wanted to cry whenever he thought of her , and there were times when he did cry ; and up until now he had n't been able even to make an effort to resume some kind of normal life . The bulky man looked half collapsed as he tried to talk about it . " I still think of her all the time . " Domingo said : " I do , too . " He reflected that he himself did n't look collapsed at all , though a couple of months ago he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he looked good , and he believed it . He added : " Is that what you came to tell me ? " Gujar said : " No . At first I did n't want to go back to Shubra . Because it would remind me too much of  --  everything . But now I think I am going back . I 've been visiting there again , and . . . I think she 'd want me to . I figured you 'd be  | page deleted  | " Oh ? " Gujar did n't understand at all . He would n't have made an acceptable second-in-command . . . but he was going on talking anyway : " Sector says they have more than enough applicants . And Sector 's willing to capitalize a new colony again . They have a big stake out here in the Milkpail now . " Domingo did n't doubt any of that . It was just that he could not help thinking of this young man before him as somehow being a traitor for feeling that it was already time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer gliding on its way through space just as before as if killing her had meant no more than wiping out another colony of nebular microlife . Gujar stayed a little longer , then took his leave , heading back to Shubra . " You do n't need a nurse anymore , " Polly said to Domingo that night , looking in on him before they retired in their separate rooms . " That 's true . " Nor do I need anyone else , either . But he did n't want to announce that fact to her just yet .  | When the captain of the Sirian Pearl returned to the hospital at Base Four Twenty-five for his next checkup , the doctors there decided that the time was ripe for them to equip him with his new leg . The implanted graft could be permanently installed , berserker 's metal bonded to human flesh and bone through carefully chosen interface materials . Aboard ship heading for the base , Polly had thought privately about having another discussion with the doctors on the subject of Domingo 's psychological state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to them . On Yirrkala her patient had said or done nothing extraordinary enough to provide evidence to back up her fears ; there was very little new that she could tell the doctors . Yet neither had anything happened to diminish her concern . Nothing had really changed . What bothered her so much in Domingo 's attitude and behavior , what made her still feel certain that some disaster was impending , would be very difficuk to get across to anyone else .  | In a two-hour operation at the base hospital , the new leg was attached successfully , to the delight of the captain . It still bothered Polly more than ever that something about having the berserker leg satisfied Domingo so intensely . And Polly did speak once more to the psychiatrists , just before she and the captain were to leave the base again on their way to visit Shubra . She consulted them without telling him while he was somewhere else , busy trying out his new leg . The psychological experts had just finished seeing the captain and chatting with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient 's progress . " He 's taking an interest in civic and business affairs on Shubra again , I understand , Ms. Suslova . " " He is ? He has n't really talked to me about that . " That was about all she could say . He could fool them more easily , she thought to herself ; and they were , at bottom , less concerned . Domingo still carried a cane , carved of Yirrkalan hothouse wood . But he was walking proudly , ably , almost naturally ( the symbiosis would improve with time ) on his new leg when he and Polly arrived on Shubra , where reconstruction was now under way in earnest . This was n't a vacation trip for either of them ; Polly still had some unfinished business on Shubra related to her former job , and Domingo still had legal rights and obligations here , where he was still a substantial landowner as well as the elected mayor . The rehabilitation of his former homeworld was proceeding quite well so far without the mayor 's involvement , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention now . Domingo was really interested only in things that would facilitate his pursuit of Old Blue , and Polly knew it . He never did tell her the truth in so many words , not even when he left her to have business meetings , but he had really come back to Shubra only to sell off his property rights . With this in mind he postponed for a while his formal resignation of the mayor 's  | office ; he thought that the hint of influence it gave him might be useful . The people who were resettling Shubra , the vast majority of them strangers to Domingo and Polly , had already erected a new assembly hall . It was a considerably bigger and better facility than the old gathering-dome had been , a solid-looking structure that conveyed an air of permanence , something to show off to potential colonists . On entering this hall for the first time , for the Festival of Dedication , Domingo was not reminded of the old dome at all . The whole shape and design were different , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , in this substantial new crystal palace , the alert lights were almost impossible to see . Until , the captain supposed , they were turned on ; and no such demonstration was scheduled for today . Mounted on one wall inside the lobby , near one rounded , ovoid interior corner of the building , not hidden but not very conspicuous either , there was a metal plaque , a simple , tasteful monument to all the people who had died here on Shubra in the great disaster of a few standard months ago . The captain did n't pause to read the listed names , but instead walked into the auditorium and took a seat for himself at one side near the rear . The place was starting to fill up , but there were few faces in the crowd that he could recognize , and fewer still showed any sign of recognizing him . There was Henric Poinsot , who nodded back . Music had already begun to play , but only irregularly and at low volume . Musicians were evidently tuning up their instruments and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains at the front of the auditorium . The Festival of Dedication , proclaimed with the intention of having it as a yearly local holiday from now on , was supposed to mark the end of the first phase of the rebuilding of the settlement . Mayor Domingo  --  today really the former mayor , because political reorganization was under way as well  --  waved and  | smiled at Polly when he saw her with the other performers , all of them wearing dancers ' costumes , heading backstage . She smiled and waved back . She had been enthusiastic , for some reason , about getting into this performance , and he had promised her that he would be here at the Festival 's opening to watch her dance . The big room was filling up rapidly . By the time the show started the situation would be standing room only , more people in this one auditorium now than had lived on the planetoid in the old days . Someone was doing a good job of selling potential colonists on the place . Maybe they were just selling themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deterred by danger if they thought that by facing it they had a chance to get ahead , to make something of their lives . Domingo had once thought in those terms  --  getting somewhere , getting ahead , building things , achieving . Owning a large share of a whole world , albeit a small one . It was certainly possible to grow wealthy here .. . Domingo was attending this opening of the Festival partly because he had promised Polly that he would , and partly in hopes of running into people he wanted to meet , wealthy new property holders , who were otherwise difficult to see . He considered these people good prospects as purchasers of the final lots of his own remaining property . He could sell those off to someone else , but he wanted a good price . The next phase of his hunt , as he had planned it , was going to require a good deal of money . And there was no telling how long his hunt was going to last . The musicians behind the curtains fell silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organized way . The expensive curtains , all of old-fashioned cloth , parted slowly to reveal the new stage , superbly designed and surprisingly deep and wide . And there was Polly , looking very beautiful in a scanty silver costume , dancing among others . Watching , Domingo realized for the first time how goodlooking she was , well above the average . After he had been watching the show for a minute or two ,  | the captain began to realize something else . Her eyes flicked in his direction , toward him and away again , whenever she happened to face him in the dance . Even in this crowded hall , Polly had taken the trouble to make sure she knew where he was sitting . He understood now that basically her dance was meant for him , as was almost everything she did these days , apart from her two children . Distraction in the form of a faint , familiar vibration in the atmosphere diverted Domingo 's attention from Polly and her show . Inside the auditorium , with music playing , the thrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow to pick it up . Turning to look out through one of the clear high walls , the captain could see that a small ship was landing at the new surface port not far away . As the craft came down , he swiveled in his seat , keeping an eye on the silvery arrival as long as possible . Maybe it brought news . The ship was down now , and silent . Meanwhile of course the show went on , the first dance over and a kind of comic tableau being enacted . Polly was in this , too . The captain , though still distracted by the thought of possible news , watched the performance . She was a very good dancer for an amateur ; the whole show was a good one , with a couple of people up front who must be professionals taking the chief parts . Not many more minutes had passed when someone came up behind Domingo and tapped him on the shoulder . A man he knew slightly , from another colony , was crouching behind him and whispered a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had just arrived onworld and who wanted to talk to him at once . " They insist that it ca n't wait . I do n't want to take you away from the show , captain , but ... " The three , two women and a man Domingo had never seen before , were standing in the rear of the hall , and with a motion of his head Domingo beckoned them over . At the same time he got up from his seat and moved toward an alcove at the side of the crowded auditorium , meeting the three visitors halfway .  | They joined him in the alcove and promptly introduced themselves . All were high-powered experts , in technology or intelligence or both , from Sector Headquarters . To a person they were intensely interested in the samples and the information that the crew of the Sirian Pearl had brought back from that berserker biological factory , and in what that factory ? they called it that  --  had been doing before it was destroyed . They wanted to know all the additional details about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three stood there with Domingo in the alcove and kept him engaged in whispered conversation while the show went on . At first he put off answering their questions , wanting to hear from them first whatever news they could tell him of Old Blue . But the three let him know they did n't consider that subject of much importance . They were good at brushing aside questions , too ; as eager to get information from Domingo as he was to obtain news from them , and just as insistent on getting their answers first . The captain answered one question for them , to show good will . Then he waited to get a helpful answer in return . Not having the information he asked for right at hand , apparently , they gave him what they had . They said Sector was almost completely convinced that a new biological weapon to be used against humanity was in the works , but that the people at headquarters were having a hard time even narrowing down the possibilities of what it was going to be . All very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else could they tell him ? When the two women experts went aside together for a few moments to confer , probably on how much they were allowed to tell Domingo , the male expert allowed himself to be distracted from business . On the stage , to whirling music , the young women of the chorus line were now coming forward one at a time , to do individual turns , Polly 's turn was on right now . " Wow Who 's she ? "  | " She 's on my crew . Are you sure no more sightings have ill been recorded ? " " Sightings ? " " Of Leviathan . " Domingo was trying to keep the edge of ! I his impatience from showing in his voice . " Leviathan . No . On your crew , hey ? " The two women rejoined the men , willing now to explain things to Domingo in a little more detail . The three visitors had brought with them the results of the computer work done at Sector Headquarters on the data gathered from the ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be of considerable importance . " You said that before . " " The indications are that the berserker was probably working on cell development . Of certain types . " " I do n't quite follow ? " " The development of large organisms , not microbes . " Domingo considered that , saw in it no direct relevance to his goal and filed it away . He continued to press the visitors for whatever information they might have on Leviathan , and at last extracted from them a promise to check with their ship 's computer , as soon as they got back to their ship , to see if it had anything along that line . By now the show , or the first phase of it anyway , was winding down . The curtains closed to enthusiastic applause . A soft spotlight picked out Domingo in his alcove , and he was called upon , as former mayor and war hero , to step forward and acknowledge a round of applause . The cheers were brief , and not overwhelming in their volume ; war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nonperformance , as mayor lately had not won him any friends . Then the spotlight swung away ; the newly chosen mayor was getting up to make a speech . That was the moment when Polly , flushed from dancing , came swiftly and gracefully down the aisle , straight to Domingo . " Did you like it ? " she panted lightly . Her silvery costume was clinging to her body , and she was sweating .  | He stared at her , his mind still pondering the evolution of large life forms by the enemy . " What ? " he asked , seeing her expectant look . The look changed to something else . She drew herself up straight , saying nothing . He turned with a new question for the intelligence experts . When he turned back again a moment later , Polly was gone . Soon after the Festival of Dedication , Domingo concluded his business on Shubra , selling off the last of his property rights for a satisfactory price . Part of the money and credit he obtained went to purchase munitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept part of it for future needs . This time he meant to pay large crew bonuses . When he saw Polly again the next day , she announced that she was not going to go with him this time . She was dropping off the crew . He looked at her , she thought , as if she were someone he had met yesterday for the first time . He said : " All right . You 're probably better off that way . "  | The little machine that killed my lovely daughter was not the same one that mangled me . Almost certainly it was not even of exactly the same type . The machine that killed her came from a different berserker  --  Old Blue . What destroyed her was a lander , an extension of Leviathan . My encounter , my crippling , was almost accidental . Almost . But her killing was not . It was the arm , the fist of Leviathan that reached out for her and came after her and crushed her beautiful ife to nothingness . Leviathan .. . Niles Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was standing at the foot of a low cliff 11 that was now almost an overhanging cliff because so much of its side had fallen in , filling in a cave . That cave that no longer existed was the spot where his daughter Maymyo had died . At least the captain thought that this sterile , blasted area , flecked with ice and snow , was the  | same spot where he had seen the charred flesh fragments and the shredded wedding garments , the honors that still seemed to have nothing to do with her . No connection with her . But the horrors had appeared and had taken over the world , and she was gone . In a few months the captain 's old homeworld had progressed a long way from being a blasted ruin . Out here away from the central settled area , the marks of the attack were still everywhere to be seen . But the renewal of the atmosphere was almost completed , and here , too , people were back . Hundreds of people , mostly contract workers , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work using the hundred varieties of machines that they had brought with them . They were decontaminating the surface and the caves and rebuilding the underground ship harbor . New and more powerful defenses had already been installed . The artificial gravity had been restored on Shubra months ago , and the wind that had shrieked over Maymyo 's freshly murdered body had long since fallen ; but there was the cliff . There were the same low hills ( Domingo thought they were the same ) rimming the theatrically near western horizon . And there , to the east , was a long , declining , half-familiar slope of clear land . Once there had been talk among the citizens of Shubra of creating an outdoor park along that incline . But the long slope was being terraced now by construction machinery , and even the hills to the west had had their profiles altered . In almost every direction , people working with large machines could be seen getting still more defensive emplacements ready . Gouges and scars in the cliff and at its foot showed the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maymyo 's old cave . Domingo 's gaze dropped again to the ground at his feet . His daughter 's remains , along with those of her dead comrades , had been cremated months ago . Looking at the scraped and frozen dirt where Maymyo had been destroyed brought  | him no closer to her or to any of his vanished life . A metal shape still stood between , and he turned away . The movement was quick and easy . His new leg was already working beautifully . Its cybernetics , which were naturally of human design and manufacture , were melding nicely into his nervous system . Like ' a fleshy organ , the new leg drew its power from the chemistry of his blood . Already the replacement was in some ways superior to his own original limb , stronger and untiring . When the leg was not covered by clothing , its appearance was- stark and gray , hard and lifeless . He had observed that to some people the sight of it was shocking . An ordinary artificial limb would have had a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been less than perfect . There were some ways , mostly sensory , in which any replacement would be inferior to the original . This leg that the doctors had given him was good enough for his purposes , and Domingo had his own reasons for preferring it . He was continually aware of the permanent difference between his new leg and his old  --  gleefully aware . It gave the captain a distinct pleasure to walk on an enemy 's bone . There was of course nothing really left of the berserker technology except the structural metal , and that metal had been hollowed out and lengthened , padded and reformed into the same shape as his natural left leg . As he was walking back toward his parked groundcar , Domingo saw another similar vehicle approaching from the north , the direction of the new temporary spaceport . The oncoming groundcar stopped beside his own , and a familiar broad-shouldered figure got out of it . Recognizing Iskander Baza , Domingo waved and walked a little faster . He was able to run now , if he tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the moment he did n't make the effort . Baza , strolling to meet him , raised a casual hand . " Hi , Cap . You 're looking good . " In the middle distance , a hundred meters away , the digging machines went on scraping and groaning and grumbling .  | The captain had to speak loudly to be heard . " You , too . What news ? " He had n't seen Baza in several months . The other shrugged . " Nothing , really . I was hoping that you had some . " Domingo looked around at the eternal mottled whiteness of the sky . " About berserkers , next to nothing . On the medical situation , a little . " " Good news , I hope . Or is that too much to hope for ? " " Good enough . " Domingo went on to explain that he had just received some encouraging words , via the regular message courier , from the doctors at Base Four Twenty-five . The results of the most recent medical tests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was now officially discharged , fit for any kind of physical activity he cared to try . Domingo did not add that the doctors ' message had also strongly recommended that he return to the base for psychological counseling on a regular basis , and that in fact an initial appointment had already been set up for him . The medics were planning to do his final plastic surgery , removing his neck scar , on the same visit . But the captain had no intention of keeping the appointment . " That 's good news . " Baza always appeared to be uncomfortable when he had to say something optimistic or favorable about anything . He looked around , but made no comment on the significance of the site where he had found Domingo , if indeed he recognized and understood it . " Where 's Polly ? " " She went back to Yirrkala . " The parting scene with her had been quiet but thoroughly unpleasant for Domingo in several ways , and he had no wish to dwell on it . " Oh . Just visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew now . " " Oh . " Iskander looked quizzical , but it was not his habit to ask directly for explanations if the captain did not volunteer them . " And Gujar ? He said he was going to look you up . " He did . Back on Yirrkala . He 's around here somewhere  | now , I suppose , supervising some of the digging . But he 's off the crew , too . " " Oh ? " " Yeah . Let 's go over to the harbor and see if any armaments have come in . " In the hours and days that followed , looking around on Shubra for people he knew were capable in a spacecraft and who had the nerve he wanted , Domingo could find no one available and ready who matched his requirements except Iskander Baza . Poinsot was here but was absorbed in the rebuilding effort ; Domingo had n't even tried to get him back on the crew . There was no one else left of his own former company : Wilma was dead , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , as the captain told Baza  --  without telling him he was included in the evaluation  --  his old crew had been far from perfect . The old Shubrans who remained here now were , like the newcomers , people determined to rebuild the colony ; the restless as well as the discouraged among the survivors had already moved on to somewhere else . People who were interested chiefly in rebuilding were not the ones Domingo wanted . He craved a full crew of six for the Pearl , but he wanted them to be the best space-combat people he could possibly get . " It looks like we 'll have to do our recruiting somewhere else , Ike . " " I think you 're right , Cap . . . maybe there 's one other possibility we could try first , before we go looking far afield . " " What 's that ? " " Spence Benkovic . I 've seen him work a ship , he 's really good . Someone was telling me he 's still up on his moon colony . " Domingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were walking the short distance back to the port , about to depart on the first leg of their recruiting journey to  | other worlds , when they heard their names being called behind them . Simeon Chakuchin had appeared back there , trotting to catch up and hailing them again . They stopped and waited for him . " Where 've you been ? " Iskander asked , when Simeon had caught up . The big young man only glanced at Iskander , then spoke to Domingo : " I just landed on Shubra an hour ago . I hear you 're looking for crew , Niles . I want to sign on again . " Simeon 's face was thinner and at the same time puffier than when Domingo had seen him last , some months ago . Something had happened to him since then . Domingo paused and thought before he answered . " You know what my plans are . It 's not a trade voyage , and not harvesting . I 'm going on a hunt , and I 'll keep at it until it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in space , in the Milk or out of it . " " I know . " Chakuchin had been nodding his agreement all along through Domingo 's speech . " That 's fine with me . I do n't fit in anywhere any more , Niles , Ike . Since Wilma ... " Domingo was looking at him carefully . You want to get back at the damned machines that killed her . " " I . . . yes. , , Domingo looked at the younger man still more closely , into his eyes and at the puffy pallor of his face . " You 're a good man , Simeon , once you make up your mind to be . But you 've been on some kind of drug . " The other shook his head . " Not any more . After she died I had a real hard time for a while . But I 'm off it now . " Chakuchin blinked . " Drugs wo n't go with me . Not on my crew . Leviathan will be all the drug we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Blue . The damned berserker . " " Of course , I . . . Leviathan . " The younger man repeated the word once more  --  thoughtfully , as if he were tasting it . As if , thought Baza , watching with amusement , he were trying his first dose .  | Chakuchin formally signed on the crew and was paid the first installment of his bonus . Then the three of them boarded the Pearl and lifted on the short hop up to the moon , intending to drop in on Benkovic 's little settlement . The moon was an angular body , shaped more like a badly made brick than like a ball . It was naturally a lot smaller even than Shubra . If the satellite had ever been given a name of its own , the local people had never got into the habit of using it . " The moon " was good enough , as Shubra possessed only the one satellite that was big enough to be noticeable at all . The loss and restoration of artificial gravity on Shubra had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; artificial gravity varied more sharply than natural gravity with distance , and the change at the distance of the moon had been relatively small . The satellite was very nearly back in its old orbit now . " I 've lived on Shubra a good many years , and I 've never been up here before , " Domingo murmured as the Pearl approached the only obvious , dedicated landing place visible on the dark , angular chunk of rock . At the site below there were three transparent landing domes , two of them closed and already holding ships , the third dome open and apparently ready to receive visitors . A few small buildings nearby were connected to the dome complex by tunnels or tubes . " I have n't been here before , either , " Simeon murmured . " I was once , " said Baza . " Some time ago . " He did not elaborate further . Domingo had not bothered to radio ahead . As they drew closer to the moon 's single small facility , they got a better look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed miniature speedbug that Spence called a battler  --  that was the craft he had been out in , scouting , on the day of Leviathan 's assault . The other hangared ship was a slower , larger harvester , the kind of vessel generally used to reap shoals of microbial life from nebular clouds . The harvester  | looked new , as it no doubt was . Whatever ships had been berthed here during the attack must have been destroyed . " Looks like somebody ought to be home . There are enough vehicles parked . " When Chakuchin transmitted a radio query , the equivalent of a polite knock at the door , the unoccupied dome flashed a signal of welcome for their ship , an automatic response . The Pearl dipped closer . The port and the nearby house both looked new , as in fact did all the constructions here . No doubt they were new . Simeon could remember hearing that the berserker had left no more standing here on the moon than on the world below . The dome port enclosed the visitors ' ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around their ship , a smaller bubble of force more easily refilled with air . Then the machinery signaled the three visitors that it was safe for them to get out of their craft . They did so , and stood there on the floor of the dome looking about them uncertainly . There was no sign as yet of any human welcome . The hangar dome was sparsely furnished , a bare-bones kind of installation . Then Simeon heard Iskander clear his throat and turned to look . A door had opened in the forcefield bubble , a door to one of the passageways , one that must connect with the small house nearby . A young woman had emerged from the open doorway to greet the three visitors . She was of average height , tending just a little to overweight . In the hot scented breeze blowing out of the tube passage , she stood there completely naked except for hothouse flowers of scarlet and purple twined in the glossy black hair that grew on her head and in three places on her body . Simeon shuffled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; clothing was expected in almost every social situation . Iskander was grinning appreciatively at the apparition in the doorway , while Domingo also inspected her but looked somewhat worried . Meanwhile the girl was smiling vaguely back at the three  | men , but really it was almost as if she did not see them . She said nothing . The visiting men exchanged a second round of looks among themselves . For some time before the disaster , word had gone around on Shubra about the unconventional lifestyle that obtained at Benkovic 's establishment . Some people had joked about a harem on the moon . Spence had even made overtures once to Maymyo , the mayor 's daughter , suggestions that she come and spend a few days at his satellite colony , but she 'd cut him off short . The young woman continued to look rather vacantly at her three visitors . Or she might be gazing just over their heads . Drugs again ? Domingo was already wondering . He thought the air blowing out from the house was perfumed , but maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had met only in passing , were rapidly increasing ; but according to all the testimony , there was no question that the man was good with a ship . Their hostess , not in the least embarrassed by her lack of clothing , broke the silence at last to announce in a childish voice : " Spence is n't here right now . " It was as if she had finally been able to overcome some inertia that had held her silent . " He 's over on the other side . " The captain spoke up , businesslike and impatient . " Do you suppose he 's coming back soon ? Or would it be better if we hopped over there and looked for him ? " The other side of the moon  --  assuming that was what she meant  --  might be all of ten kilometers away . " I 'm Niles Domingo . This is Iskander Baza . And Simeon Chakuchin . " The young woman did not acknowledge the introductions or offer her own name in return . Her attitude did not appear to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to arouse or shock . Rather it was as if she were not really interacting with the men at all . When she spoke again she might have been talking to herself . " I guess maybe he 'll be back shortly . " " Has he guessed that we 're here , d' you suppose ? " Iskander asked .  | " I 'll give him a call , " the young woman said , with the air of one struck by a sudden , brilliant thought . She turned slowly away , then walked quickly back into the passage . Her flowers , no longer fresh , swung droopily as she turned . Her figure under ordinary circumstances would not have drawn much attention . She had left the door open behind her . The three men exchanged looks yet once more . Then , with Domingo leading , they followed their reluctant hostess through the tube and into the house . In contrast to the landing dome , the dwelling had been profusely and wildly decorated . There were flowers , live and cut , everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what Simeon supposed ought to be called found objects . But the place was none too clean . A housework robot stood propped at an angle in one corner of the room , the drivers on two corners of its base unable to reach the dusty floor . No one had expended the moment 's effort necessary to set the machine upright . The three visitors overtook their hostess in the first large room they came to amid heaps of garish pillows , more flowers and food containers , most of which were used and empty . Some of the furniture was reasonably conventional , and some of that was broken . The dark-haired woman looked at them uncomfortably , murmured something that might have been " Wait here , " and disappeared again through another doorway . Simeon supposed the odds were even as to whether she intended to come back or whether she was going to communicate with Spence . The men looked at each other and sat down , rather uneasily . After about five minutes the three , still waiting , heard faint murmurings of machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's arrival . In a couple of minutes more , Spence Benkovic hurried into the room , to his visitors ' relief . Greetings were exchanged , and Benkovic offered drinks , though rather doubtfully , as if he was n't sure what he had in stock . The offer was politely declined .
