LIFE AFTER THE BOMB Philadelphia FOR WILSON GOODE , there may he life after the bomb . Philadelphia 's first black mayor was a rising star of national politics . Then , on May 13 , after a daylong siege , he allowed his police department to drop an explosive device on the headquarters of a radical cult named MOVE . The device , familiarly known as " the bomb , " started a fire that left 11 cult members dead , 61 row houses in ashes , and 250 residents of a black , working-class neighborhood with nowhere to live . Now , seven months later , the mayor of Philadelphia must be listed among the survivors of the MOVE disaster . Not a single Philadelphian of even modest stature is calling for Wilson Goode 's recall , impeachment , or resignation . This is not to deny the severity of his MOVE-related wounds or the instability of his political condition . One friendly city councilman has suggested that the MOVE debacle could become his " Iran ? a kind of symbol of what was wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goode " and " MOVE " have become forever inseparable . That linkage has caused some civic leaders to believe that the real damage has only begun to appear , that every subsequent setback will only reinforce public disgust with the way he handled his greatest crisis . Goode himself continues to insist that his political standing is firm : " If I ran today , " he says , " I would win . " Perhaps . According to a recent poll taken for the Philadelphia Inquirer , 70 percent of the public thinks he is doing a good job as mayor , down from a pre-MOVE peak of 79 percent . Yet Wilson Goode is no longer the same man who slew Frank Rizzo in 1983 or who qualified for a vice presidential interview with Walter Mondale in 1984 . Would-he candidates are already raising money to run against him in 1987 , and portraying the recent electoral defeat of the Democratic candidate for district attorney as an affront to Goode . The Inquirer poll also reveals that 50 percent now disapprove of his handling of the MOVE confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for him , not knowing who the alternatives might he . " The reality is that he is on a very dangerous political curve , " says Steve Teichner , who conducted the poll . The mayor 's problems stem as much from the aftermath of the MOVE confrontation as from the event itself . Soon after the disaster , Goode appointed a commission to conduct a public investigation . The mayor 's critics howled , saying that for Goode to appoint the investigators of MOVE made about as much sense as Nixon naming the investigators of Watergate . But the commission and its staff took their task seriously . They held 18 days of public hearings in October and November , all of them televised gavel-togavel on the local public station . For Goode , the hearings turned out to be more damaging than the confrontation itself . His constituents most of whom had been prepared to give him every benefit of the doubt ? got a close look at how his administration turned a no-win situation into an extraordinary crisis . The picture that emerged from the hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plosive device ( they do not like the word " bomb " ) would he dropped on MOVE 's roof by a helicopter rather than placed there by policemen ? During his first appearance before the commission , Goode , who spent May 13 in his City 1 loll office , testified that he did not know a helicopter had been used until after the fact . But his man on the scent ' , then-managing director Leo Brooks , said he had telephoned the mayor about the helicopter and had received approval to use it . Two subsequent witnesses , including then-police commissioner Gregore Samhor , confirmed Brooks 's statements . In a second appearance , Goode stuck to his story , but said he probably would have approved dropping the device from a helicopter had he been asked . His answer did not satisfy Henry Ruth , the former Watergate special prosecutor who served on the MOVE Commission . " See , my problem is that , as a citizen , the idea of dropping a bomb in an urban area of row houses should have been rejected out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no question that it was a bad idea , " Goode replied . " And if anyone had come to me and said to me , ' I 'm going to drop a bomb on a row house , ' I would have , in fact , rejected it Out ot hand . " Of course , someone did competence , and direction . In their testimony , the city 's top decision-makers , including the mayor , justified their behavior on the grounds that they had no choice but to follow recommendations from underlings they considered experts ? a kind of logic that Goode 's predecessor , Bill Green , labeled the " reverse Nuremburg " theory . Goode , for instance , said that he was " ultimately responsible " for what happened , yet he consistently portrayed himself as a leader who was misguided , misinformed , and even ignored by his ranking subordinates . He and his lieutenants contradicted each other throughout the oddly emotionless hearings , and they did not seem particularly disturbed by the contradictions . For example , did Goode know in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit not in su many words , and he did not reject it out of hand . The real casualty of the MOVE episode was the skillfully crafted image of Goode the manager , or , in the view of his critics , the " myth " of Goode the manager . As a candidate in 1983 , the sharecropper 's son from North Carolina sold himself to the voters as a color-blind problem-solver , a decent man with real managerial skills , a Wharton graduate . Even now , few question his decency , but many question his ability . " For the first time in his governmental life , Wilson Goode has to produce , " said an adviser to one of Goode 's potential opponents . " He has to go beyond the ribbon-cutting , the news conferences , and all the other media garbage . He 's never been a manager . You come to him with a problem and he says , ' Done ! ' Not only is n't it done , you never hear another word about it . " Goode 's mission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint a new police commissioner to replace the resigned Sambor , reorganize a police department riddled with corruption , respond to the MOVE Commission 's forthcoming report , secure state financing for a new convention center , get the City Council to agree to a controversial and costly trash disposal system ? all without a substantial tax increase . The task looked imposing even before May 13 . And the residue of MOVE ? the rebuilding of the neighborhood , the legislative investigations , the civil suits and possible criminal trials ? will linger for months , if not years . In narrow political terms , however , Goode 's future looks salvageable , assuming he can claim at least a few governmental successes . Though his prospects for a career beyond Philadelphia probably expired on May 13 , he remains a formidable candidate for reelection . As long as the black community stands solidly behind him , he is nearly unbeatable in a Democratic primary , where blacks represent 45 percent of the vote . Goode might be more vulnerable in the general election , where the black vote is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local politicians that the strongest Republican candidate might be Arlen Specter . Yet Specter is very attached to his seat in the U.S. Senate . The Specter-for-Mayor scenario requires that Specter be challenged by Governor Dick Thornburgh in the Republican Senate primary next spring , that Specter lose , that he return home to Philadelphia , and that he immediately reset his sights from getting the nuclear arms race controlled to getting the trash collected . Meanwhile , the 65-year-old Rizzo , who described himself as " the tiger in the tall grass " before his 1983 race against Goode , is telling his friends that he has one race left in him . This time , friends say , he might wear Republican stripes , even though no Republican has been elected mayor of Philadelphia since 1947 . Oddly enough , if the Rizzo candidacy materializes , it just might be the best thing that ever happened to the incumbent . The return of Frank Rizzo to the arena might be the one event that could make Wilson Goode whole again .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
