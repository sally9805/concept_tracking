New brains and brawn for Central America <P> Few problems have frustrated the Reagan Administration more than its inability to rally support for its Central American policies . As the President lamented to a convention of longshoremen meeting in Hollywood , Fla. , last week : " Many of our citizens do n't fully understand the seriousness of the situation . " Indeed , Congress and the public have generally remained either uninterested in or downright skeptical about American support for the government in El Salvador , which is struggling against left-wing rebels , and U.S. opposition to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua , which is struggling against CIA-backed insurgents . So in addition to speaking loudly last week , Reagan brandished weapons . He appointed a special twelve-man commission headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to shape a national consensus on Central America , and he dispatched an aircraft carrier battle group for a dubious dramatization of U.S. firmness and commitment in the region . <P> At the urging of National Security Adviser William Clark and U.N . Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , Reagan has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has toughened his public pronouncements and made significant changes in the State Department hierarchy . This has caused concern in Congress that he is stressing a military approach too strongly . The purpose of the Kissinger Commission is , ostensibly , to give advice on long-term American policy in Central America and help coalesce public support for these goals . But despite its somewhat vague mandate , it has a clear-cut political purpose : justifying the deeper extended commitment in Central America , both military and economic , that the Reagan Administration has clearly decided is necessary for the protection of U.S. interests . <P> The idea of a bipartisan commission on Central America was promoted by Kirkpatrick . She discussed it in February with two Democrats on Capitol Hill , Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and Congressman Michael Barnes of Maryland , and they sponsored resolutions calling for such a panel . Despite its success in using blue-ribbon groups to handle the hot issues of Social Security reform and the MX missile , the White House was skeptical at first . But by the end of June , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , the idea began to sound better . " We 're going to have to build a consensus on Capitol Hill damn soon , " said a senior Reagan aide . " We had to try something different . " <P> For Kissinger , who in recent months has become a regular informal consultant to Clark , the appointment presented a chance to return to a position of official power . For the Reagan Administration , which has often been criticized for lacking depth in international affairs , tapping Kissinger was a way to lend credibility to foundering aspects of its foreign policy . But the choice was nonetheless surprising . The commission was formed in part to dampen domestic controversy , and Kissinger is , above all , a highly controversial figure . Indeed , in his unsuccessful 1976 primary campaign against President Gerald Ford , Reagan launched a sustained series of attacks on Kissinger , saying , among other things , " Kissinger 's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy has coincided precisely with the loss of U.S. military supremacy .
