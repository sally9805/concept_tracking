a very good place to learn about your business , even if your business is planning conventions . But it 's a pretty good place to jump around in a great big sack .

All the meeting planners I talked to said they 'd had a pretty good time at the MPI convention , and especially at Super Sports II . They were less certain , though , about whether it had all been worth the time and expense . One man said that for him the high point of the convention was hearing George Plimpton speak on the morning after Super Sports II .

By 1975 the topic in vogue was " Limits to Growth ' 75 . First Biennial Assessment of Alternatives to Growth .

In Naisbitt 's formulation , the United States will become a sort of giant university , with the rest of the world ? the folks who make things and get dirty doing it ? paying us for our insights and wisdom .

His first job was in the public relations department of Eastman Kodak . From there he went to the Unitarian Service Committee ; the Great Books Foundation ; the public relations department of Montgomery Ward ; the National Safety Council , as director of information ; the U.S. Commission on Education in Washington ; John Gardner 's staff , as a special assistant ; and IBM in Chicago in 1966 . He left 1BM after two years to strike out on his own . In 1969 Naisbitt was reading a history of the Civil War by Bruce Catton that used newspapers to reconstruct the era . Naisbitt had one of those epiphanies that look so good in newspaper profiles years later . He went out to a Chicago newsstand and bought sixty out-of-town newspapers , read them , and realized he had found his own little niche in the consulting world . In 1970 Naisbitt began the Trend Report , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really going on by analyzing local newspapers . Through all his various incarnations since then , Naisbitt 's main product has always been the Trend Report . What the Trend Report offers is a quarterly look at the zeitgeist , complete with bar graphs , for people too insecure to trust their own conclusions about the times they live in . Its purpose , according to TNG literature , " is to provide clients with a competitive edge through the early identification and understanding of major social , economic and political trends in the country . . . . This is the only private service in the country that employs content analysis of local newspapers in its research . " In other words , John Naisbitt is n't just some run-of-the-mill prognosticator ; he has science . in the form of content analysis , to back him up . As TNG 's fact sheet points out , its research is founded on a data base , consisting of two million arHARPER'S/SEPTEMBER 1983 tides from local newspapers , which is growing every month by 20,000 articles from 6,000 newspapers . The newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington and Denver offices . ( When TNG says it reads 6,000 newspapers a month , it means the same thing that you would if you subscribed to a single daily paper and said you read thirty-one newspapers a month . So , in fact , they read about 200 newspapers a month . ) Two million articles from local newspapers is the sort of daunting statistic that makes you think that even if his conclusions are wrong , you are n't about to double-check the raw data yourself . ( Probably not even Ronald Reagan knows how high a stack of two million articles from local papers would be if he held it in his palm . ) By quantifying the frequency with which specific subjects appear in the press , content analysis claims to make qualitative judgments about those subjects . The assumption behind Naisbitt 's use of content analysis is that newspapers oiler ? unwittingly , mind you ? an absolute reflection of reality somehow free of the outmoded assumptions he says hamper most decision making . In Megatrends Naisbitt explains , " As anyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the paper out on time . There is a certain amount of choice over which stories will appear in the paper , but not much . " This happens to be wrong . Yes , the paper must be gotten out on time . Beyond that , anyone who has worked on a newspaper ( Naisbitt has n't ) knows that putting out a newspaper is nothing but choices . But even if you grant that a careful content analysis of the nation 's local newspapers may be useful , the Naisbitt Group is most certainly not doing it . Their method of quantifying clips is meaningless and the conclusions drawn from their " research " are unsupported . To read , clip , and categorize the approximately 115 newspapers that make up the national Trend Report data base is a laborious and expen- Say Africa and some people picture mud huts and watering holes .

It 's sort of like est , either you get it or you do n't . Mendelsohn then writes a summary , which is discussed at the staff research meeting and then incorporated in the quarterly Trend Report . The whole process is casual . Despite Naisbitt 's proselytizing about the new high-tech information age , TNG 's data is not computerized . To date , computerization has been too expensive , says Jeffrey Hallett , president of TNG . Of course , a computer is n't essential for careful analysis , but it is difficult for the Naisbitt Group 's analysts to have any historical perspective because the hard data is so cumbersome to retrieve .

Naisbitt writes , " Trends , like horses . are easier to ride in the direction they are already going . " I-lis analogy proves more revealing than he perhaps intended . Taking a page from Megatrends ( pp. 116-117 , actually ) : " The efforts of local recycling groups have ... proved invaluable of late . " The firm is recycling the Trend Report in as many ways as it can . In addition to the national Trend Report there are four regional ones : California , Florida , Rocky Mountains , and Upper Midwest . A subscription to the national Trend Report is $1,250 , each regional one $875 . For a mere $87 a year you can receive John Naisbitt 's Trend Letter , with biweekly thoughts such as : " Restructuring . . . the move to a new economic foundation . is gaining momentum rapidly . This year could be pivotal if the pace continues his ellipses and emphasis . " If you doubt that this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding your horse in the wrong direction . Just read the Trend Report , vols . I and II ( 1982 ) , p. 17 : " There HARPER'S/SEPTEMBER 1983 is growing evidence that the newsletter will emerge as one of the major information channels of the new age . " Sometimes runaway trends collide head-on . In volume III of the Trend Report ( 1982 ) , under the rubric " Networking to Weather the Recession , " we learn the following : As the recession continues to harrF tner away at industry and individuals alike , the " social costs " of unemployment are rising : crime rates have increased ; physical and mental illnesses are troubling a greater number of people ; and there has been a steady rise in the number of divorces and other fatuity problems . Correspondingly , however , there has been a decided increase in the numbers of individuals and organizations that reach out to help others . Networking ? joining forces to share resources ? has become a popular means of weathering the storms of recession . In Megatrends Naisbitt writes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or has recently been , in a recession . " Of course Naisbitt has n't been around the office too much lately , what with all the individuals and organizations reaching out to help him promote Megatrends , so perhaps the recession heresy slipped by him . No evidence is given to support the claim that crime , illness , and divorce are increasing , nor does any evidence show that the alleged increases are caused by the recession ? which we may or may not be in . The evidence mostly shows that the point of " Networking to Weather the Recession " is to prove that Megatrend number eight , " Hierarchies to Networking , " is , to adopt the Trend Report 's imagery , taking the country by storm . The same Trend Report states : " Is Crime on the Decline ? For the first time in years , statistics reveal a decrease in reported crimes , suggesting , perhaps , that a nationwide get tough on crime ' attitude is having an impact . " Maybe this statement is just a sneaky way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were , crime would be on the increase . Maybe the sourceless statis ties confirm ' that " networking " works so well in times of ( non ) recession that it can reduce crime even when crime is increasing . Maybe nobody at TNG knows . T HE MOST rigorous thing about the Trend Report is the charts that precede the categories and subcategories and measure the " activity " in each over several years . For example , the " Violence &; Crime " subcategory of volume III , 1982 , charts a rise in " activity " from 1979 until 1982 , followed by a sharp decline during the latter year . It is important to remember , however , that this chart does not illustrate the amount of crime committed , or the volume of crimes reported , during the period . The " activity " in question is the number of articles about crime that the people in New Canaan sent to the Naisbitt Group 's offices , It 's hard to imagine how corporations such as ABC , General Motors , or Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps the sense of d ? la vu induced by reading the Trend Report is the key to its appeal . If you are spending thousands of dollars for research founded on a base of two million articles that is growing every month by 20,000 articles from 6.000 newspapers ( depending on how you count these things ) , and you already know everything the research says , you 're going to feel quite on top of things . Naisbitt 's corporate subscribers are unblushing about the fact that they ca n't really tell you what they do with this information . Florence Friedman , associate research director of Ogilvy &; Mather , the advertising agency , says that the Trend Report " provides a context for thinking . It 's incredibly useful , it really broadens your thinking . " How ? " No specific action comes to mind . " Dr. Waiter Albers , of the societal analysis department of General Motors , says , " We use the reports as part of the input to try to identify the trends and emerging issues that go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman for ABC , says , " It 's a nonbaloney , non-esoteric approach to what 's going on .... We use it a couple of general ways . On one level , trends are important for us to track in order to see what might be interesting in programming . It 's also important to know generic trends when thinking about corporate acquisitions and modifying our subdivisions . I wo n't tell you the Trend Report created decisions in and of itself . It added to the decisions . " John Snow , director of planning and research and of corporate public relations at Sears , says , " We are looking at all changes that are taking place in society and trying to make management aware of them . Content analysis is one of many inputs we are using in trend scanning . ... I would not want to single out any one decision made on the basis of trend reporting . It 's part of the overall understanding of the fabric . " Felicia Del Campo , a spokeswoman for Safeway , the supermarket chain , says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it available to our division managers . " And what specifically do they do with it ? " I ca n't answer . It 's a somewhat incnncrete service . You have to feel it 's something you believe is useful . It 's not like a can of peas . " Information , facts , analysis ? none of that is what Naisbitt is really selling in his corporate consulting , explains Jeffrey Hallett . " There 's very little we tell people they do n't already know , rationally or in their gut , " Hallett says . " But they have n't had a good set of concepts so that they can rationally talk about it .... By the end of the session they have a common vocabulary . When someone says high-tech , high-touch , it means something to everyone . " According to Hallett , at business school they had a term for the kind of services TNG offers ? " soft and fuzzy . " " It is soft and fuzzy , " Hallett says . " Meaning that it 's not hard financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard data , he says , does n't tell you much when you 're moving into a new age . Perhaps there 's a corollary here : the time of 22 the works are foreign franchises , special-issue Trend Reports on education , health care , financial services , and the food industry , and new offices in California and New England . Naisbitt will also be touting the newest megatrend he 's spotted , " the shift from machismo to androgyny . " Caught up in this force , he and his second wife , Patricia Aburdene , " will be working closer and closer together , - he says . " We 've been making a number of speeches together and that will accelerate . It will be useful to have more couples as models , That 's very rarely done . " Naisbitt will be establishing the School for Intrapreneurs ( yes , you read that right ) . Intrapreneurs arc people who develop new products and services with the support of the companies they work for , instead of starting their own businesses . In association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over a six-month period , training up to three intraprcneurs for between $70,000 and $100,000 . It may seem painfully self-evident that any smart company would encourage its employees to come up with new ideas , but the TNG literature promises a " systematic conceptualization of the intrapreneur as a normal way of life .... " Naisbitt will also be exercising his evangelical side on the lecture circuit : " I really think the great , if not the only hope for world peace is the global economy which , incidentally , is Megatrend number threcj . We are going that way , except for this neoprotectionism . I want to make speeches about world peace through world trade .... " " I 've become a more spiritual person recently , " he says .
