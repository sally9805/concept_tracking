At a press conference at the European Parliament in Strasbourg , the Dalai Lama suggested that Tibet be granted the status of " association " with China . <P> Under the plan , Tibetans would have the " right to decide on all matters concerning Tibet , " the Dalai Lama said , while China would retain authority over foreign affairs and , for a time , defense . Beijing officials responded to the Dalai Lama 's suggestion by warning foreigners to stop providing a forum for proposals that aim at " undermining China 's territorial integrity .
