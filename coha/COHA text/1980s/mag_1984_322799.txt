First it was the Marine Corps advertising for " a few good men . " Now the Air Force Security Training Command is getting in step with a newspaper campaign in search of " a few good dogs . " Their duties : serving as guard dogs and as sniffers in the search for terrorist bombs and drugs . <P> The payoff for a lifetime hitch is $400 , not to the dog but to its owner . The Government does not , of course , discriminate between males and females , but equal-opportunity laws are bypassed when it comes to breeding ; recruitment is limited to such watchful species as German shepherds and Rottweilers . The " military working dogs " are shipped to Texas for basic training at Lackland Air Force Base , where they learn obedience , mauling , snarling , sniffing and other suitable skills . In the new armed forces , the routine is hardly a dog 's life . An animal psychologist is on hand if basic training becomes too tough .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
