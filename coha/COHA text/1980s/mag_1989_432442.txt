 | Laminates and surfacing materials have always reminded me of politicians . They rarely seem to live up to expectations . At first blush , so-called solid surfacing , thick sheets of acrylic or polyester with the color and pattern all the way through " Slabs of Color , " June , seems ideal : It is handsome and durable ? and fixable if it is scratched or scorched . But it is difficult to work with , generally requiring professional installation ; it is heavy , has limited application , and is expensive . Plastic laminate , the old thin-sheet standby , is versatile , inexpensive , reasonably easy to work with , and getting better-looking each year as colors and patterns are added to the repertoire . But laminate is easily marred  | and subject to wear , and it is not reparable . A third surfacing choice , wood veneer , though not suitable for bath or kitchen counter tops , can be excellent for desks , tables , and other light-duty uses where its natural beauty can be appreciated . But veneer is fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these shortcomings have been addressed by three new surfacing materials : ? Avonite Corp . is just introducing a so-called " solid laminate , " a thin version of its solid-sheet material that is less expensive , lighter , and more versatile than its thicker brothers . ? Nevamar 's ARP ( abrasion-resistant-print ) coating makes its plastic laminates more wear resistant than conventional laminate . ? Wilsonart 's Craftwood laminate marries real wood veneer to laminate-style backing for a tough , easyto-use , and easy-to-work natural-wood surfacing material . The technology behind these new materials is at least as interesting as the products themselves . " With Avonite , Corian , Fountainhead , and the rest of the thick solid-sheet materials , you have products that are reparable and give the appearance of depth and substance , " says Lon Risley , technical director for Avonite Corp . " Our thin material does all those things , but it also has the advantage of being more like a plastic laminate in its workability . " Indeed , Avonite 's " solid laminate , " called FormStone , seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Vs inch thick , it is thin and light enough to be handled easily and applied to walls and other vertical surfaces with standard silicone adhesives . Yet because it is a solid sheet of polyester , it should resemble the standard ' /2-inch and thicker solid-sheet materials when it is applied , and it is reparable if damaged . This is in contrast to those laminates that also have fulldepth color , thus eliminating the telltale brown line on finished edges . Because these laminates are made of layers of colored paper , once the textured surface finish is damaged , it can not be repaired or sanded out . FormStone is so new that there were no installations of it available for me to examine . But I did see samples ? flecked stonelike patterns in glossy brown and satin gray and white . The glossy sample displays a beguiling three-dimensional depth , as if you were looking into molten granite . Aesthetically , it is on par with conventional Avonite , but it 's claimed to have even better physical properties . " Because we process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , " Risley explains , " the thin Avonite , due to its diminished mass , becomes more heatsaturated , and the polymers become more fully crosslinked , or stabilized . It 's like the difference between cooking a roast and a strip of bacon . If you have a fixed cooking time , as in the Avonite process , the roast will be rare done while the bacon is well done . This more complete cross-linking results in a stronger , more impact-resistant and more stable material . " FormStone is also more resistant to thermal deformation , Risley told me . A thick sheet must first absorb the shock of heat or cold and then , because of its greater mass and less complete cross-linking , move in some direction , often resulting in a bubble or other deformation . The thin material , with its reduced mass and greater stability , can absorb the heat or cold and dissipate it quickly . All has not gone smoothly with FormStone , however . " One would think that a thin material would be easier to cast than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the opposite is true . In our early experience the thin material tended to hang up and not come out of the mold in a continuous sheet , " Risley adds . " We had to experiment with wetting agents and surface-tension materials . These were more engineering problems than chemical or technological ones , and we had to work them out one by one . " Though it 's too early to tell ( pricing and distribution are not set yet ) , Risley expects FormStone to be sold eventually in home centers and lumberyards . Is he a bit too enthusiastic about FormStone as a do-it-yourself material ? Perhaps . After all , the challenge of proper finishing still remains see box in " Slabs of Color , " June . But with its reduced price , light weight , beauty , and reparability , it should be welcome by those about to renovate a kitchen or bath . And because it is monolithic , it should wear better than plastic laminate . But , then , laminate 's durability is improving as well . Conventional plastic laminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kraft paper impregnated with phenolic resin . The topmost layer is a high-cellulose pigmented Qrl I 0 ! 1E1111 AD CrIC nIrC nCrCnn DCO 1.0.  | paper . The resin that covers the surface of most kinds of laminate is melamine formaldehyde , which is the hardest plastic known . But in everyday use , other materials ? metal cans , silica in kraft paper and cardboard boxes ? that are harder than the plastic slide across its surface , scratching and dulling the finish over time . Enter ARE " The key to the abrasion resistance of the ARP coating is the use of aluminum oxide , " says Robin O'Dell , manager of research and development for Nevamar Corp . Ruby and sapphire are forms of aluminum oxide . Almost as hard as diamond , aluminum oxide has a value of nine on the Mho scale ( a measurement of hardness ) , compared with diamond 's 10 ; silica comes in at three or four , for example , while melamine is even lower . " Others have attempted using abrasion-resistant coatings , " says O'Dell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thick layer that detracts from the laminate 's appearance and chews up cutting tools ? even those with carbide tips . " Nevamar developed its own technology for depositing a microscopically thin layer . The aluminum oxide is applied in an aqueous solution that also contains a chemically inert substance called microcrystalline cellulose , a chemical building block of wood . Think of the microcrystalline cellulose as a kind of glue between the aluminum oxide and the cellulose-fiber top layer of the laminate . Molecules of aluminum oxide , melamine , and microcrystalline cellulose , which are bound together , attach to the cellulose fibers in the laminate through hydrogen bonding . This is accomplished in a 1,200-psi press . The resulting microscopic layer is thin enough to be transparent and to prevent excessive tool wear yet is hard enough to withstand normal wear and tear better than conventional laminates , says O'Dell . " We 've done extensive testing of the ARP surface , both in the laboratory and in the field , " O'Dell tells me . One standard test , for example , is called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wheel and grinding the laminate for 500 cycles . The wear value for ARP-protected laminate measures three times better than that of conventional laminate . " In another test , " O'Dell says , " we installed conventional Nevamar laminate and ARP laminate side by side in a local convenience store for six months . After two weeks the conventional , or control , surface had visible scratches and the ARPprotected surface was like new . At the end of the test , the control had significant gloss loss compared with the ARP surface . " All Nevamar laminates , both textured and glossy , are available with the ARP surface at no extra cost . Unlike many other brands of glossy laminate , Nevamar 's may be used in a horizontal application . Glossy surfaces , however , will show wear faster than textured . A more delicate , and in some cases more desirable , surface treatment is real wood veneer , and Wilsonart 's Craftwood laminate makes veneering easier . " Craftwood works like plastic laminates , " says Bob Dermody , vice president of SR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You use a router and contact cement to apply it , and it is stiff , strong , and easy to handle ? not nearly as brittle and prone to cracking as conventional veneer . Also , imperfections in the substrate wo n't show through as they might with conventional veneer . " Unfortunately , Craftwood also shares a problem common to most laminates : The core is exposed as a brown line that shows around the perimeter of the surface unless all edges are covered . A major advantage of Craftwood is that it is a stable product ; it does not expand and contract , according to Dermody . The key to achieving this quality from natural wood is a process called stress relieving . " Normally , as wood absorbs moisture it expands , then contracts as the moisture evaporates , " explains Dermody . " Our stress-relieving process involves breaking down surface fibers and stretching the wood so it can pick up moisture without movement . " Have you ever seen someone take a ribbon and run scissors across it ? " asks Dermody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've broken the fibers on that surface of the ribbon , expanding one side . The resulting tension causes the ribbon to curl . If you turn over the ribbon and run the scissors across the other side , the ribbon will straighten out because you 've equalized the tension . But the ribbon has also been stretched slightly . " The same thing happens with our veneer , " Dermody continues . " It goes through the stress reliever ? a machine with an 18-inch-diameter rolling drum and steel bars that act like the scissors ? twice . The first time the veneer is curled up ; the second time it lies flat . And it 's been stretched . Now the veneer . applied to the backing , will pick up and lose moisture without movement . " The ' /64-inch-thick stressrelieved wood veneer is bookmatched ( in which every other veneer leaf is turned over ? the most desirable pattern for veneers and bonded to conventional phenolic-resin backing for an overall thickness of 0.04 inch .

If nothing else , these new high-tech toppers ? FormStone , ARP , and Craftwood ? will have expectations running high . @# 92 1 POPULAR SCIENCE DECEMBER 1989
