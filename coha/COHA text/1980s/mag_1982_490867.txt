MY FAVORITE YEAR " is about hero worship , and surprisel  --  it 's for it . The pic  --  ture is set in New York in 1954 the year that the live Saturday-night TV series " Your Show of Shows " was at its peak popularity . That was the year NBC divided it into two shows by separating its stars , Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca , and created a third as  --  set by signing their producer , Max Liebman , to put on specials . " Your Show of Shows " was followed by " Caesar 's Hour , " in which big Sid was teamed with Nanette Fabray , and these two series have merged in peo  --  ple 's memories , where Sid Caesar has the hallowed status of genius , because of his own gifts and because of the writers who worked on his shows  --  Neil and Danny Simon , Carl Reiner , Larry Gelbart , Lucille Kallen , Joe Stein , Mel Brooks , and Woody Allen , among others . " My Favorite Year " is a fictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  famous writers were brainstorming to  --  gether , shouting ideas into the air or , as in the cases of the shy Neil Simon and Woody Allen , whispering their jokes to a fearless , brass-lunged con  --  federate . It helps to know the legends , because some of the scenes are n't fully shaped , but if you did n't know anything about Sid Caesar or his writing team you could still laugh at " My Favorite Year " ? the characters and situations are alive on their own . This show-busi  --  ness farce is the first film directed by Richard Benjamin , and the lighting is gummy , the views of Broadway are a blur , and the staging sometimes creaks ? it even klonks . But the film has a bubbling spirit , and I was carried along by the acting and by Benjamin 's near-libidinous reverence for his smart-ass characters . This man is crazy about actors  --  not a had start for a director . As Stan ( King ) Kaiser , the brawny star of the TV show " Comedy Caval  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox . Absent-minded , slugged ? like a heavyweight who has just gone ten rounds  --  he stares down at the small people who work for him as if he could n't remember what they were there for . He stares down even at people who are taller than he is . What makes Bologna so authentic is that he has a manic force field , and it was precisely the comics with this kind of aggressive aura ( Sid Caesar , Milton Berle , Jackie Gleason , the young Steve Allen ) who came across the strongest on early , live TV . Somehow , TV filtered out their threat , and viewers did n't register it . ( What viewers expe  --  rienced was simply their energy . ) But backstage how could anybody miss it ? Bologna 's King Kaiser is a looming presence , and there does n't have to he trouble for him to smell it ; violent and depressive , he holds his ground , and if his punches knock someone out he has a self-congratulatory reflex  --  with a gigantic paw , he shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has surrounded himself with talker-writer prodigies , King has no layer of the script , which is by Norman Steinberg and Dennis Pa lumbo , is about the truculent , half mad King in relation to the writers in their rumpus-room office . They , of course , think they 're the reason he gets laughs . Sy , the senior gagman ( Bill Macy ) , rants about everything they have to do ; even his personal griev ances are all-encompassing . Bill Macy has a true comic artist 's understanding of sleaze , as he proved in " The Late Show " ( he was the failed talent agent turned bar tender ) , and he has a gift for bringing unexpected depth and detail to a role , as he demonstrated in the otherwise tinny " Serial " ( he was the suicide ) . When Sy holds forth to the other writers about what he 's going to say to King , he sounds as if his life is on the line ; when King con fronts him , he retreats in stantly . He 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of a recantation . This rancorous old war horse of a gagwriter has all the mechanisms to survive in the business ; when he goes home , he probably sleeps like a baby . ( He 's no saner than King  --  just more verbal . ) As the only woman in the bunch , the nifty Anne De Salvo makes you understand at once why the attractive but self-deprecating Alice would he accepted , and how much she enjoys being part of this competitive craziness where anyone 's best lines may he stepped on . The youngest of the writers  --  and the film 's protagonist  --  is a small chip  --  munk called Benjy , whose actions are probably based partly on the exploits of the young Mel Brooks ( his company co-produced the film ) , with maybe some borrowing from the early life of Woody Allen . The role is played by Mark Linn-Baker , who is dark-haired and has a round face with pointy features  --  even a pointy chin . His Benjy is button-eyed and shiny  --  a snookums . He looks as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come out . This Brooklyn wor  --  rywart with cultural yearnings and conflicts about becoming a gagwriter is like a Jewish-intellectual version of Eddie Bracken . It 's a tricky role ; at times Linn-Baker is borderline ghast  --  ly , and at other times he seems just what was needed , and quite inventive . Then you may be dubious again  --  especially in the scenes between Benjy and the producer 's assistant , played by Jessica Harper , whom he considers his girl . ( Her boss , the teeth-gnashing producer , is played by Adolph Green , who certainly has a lot of teeth to gnash . ) You 'd never guess what a re  --  markable performer Jessica Harper can be from what she does here ; she has no role to play , and the only time she does n't seem like a bad actress is when she 's telling Benjy why she is n't interested in him  --  she 's saying things you agree with . What finally saves Linn-Baker is that Benjy is given the task of keeping an eye on the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making sure that this notorious womanizing boozer stays sober . In his first big movie role , Linn-Baker has the good luck to play most of his scenes with Peter O'Toole . As the guest from Hollywood  --  the peacock Alan Swann , who is part John Barrymore and part Errol Flynn ( maybe the best parts of each ) ? O'Toole is simply astounding . In re  --  cent years , he has n't had the press he deserves  --  particularly in England . Maybe , having had the nobility of a certain kind of stardom conferred upon him , he is thought not to have kept his side up . His recent performances seem to he an answer to that ; he 's say  --  ing , " See , I 'm not gone  --  you 're just looking in the wrong place . " And he has been getting better as an actor . When you watch him work in " The Stunt Man " or on TV in " Masada " or here , it 's clear that he does n't impress himself with what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  not even what stars usually hold back to make you know they 're stars . While others turn into immobile figureheads , he has become a master of physical comedy  --  a whirlwind on the order of Barrymore in " Twentieth Century . " O'Toole 's Alan Swann arrives at the TV production facilities and col  --  lapses  --  apparently dead drunk , but not quite unconscious . He hears King 's decision to hump him from the show and hears Benjy make an impassioned plea that they keep him . And when he 's on his feet he acknowledges his debt to Benjy . At that moment , we 're his , and , as a result , we know why Benjy is his . Drunk , Alan Swann is n't merely swozzled  --  he 's liquefied . But in his woozy eyes you can still see his imagination at play , and you recognize that he exults in his diction and the fine , trained voice that echoes hack . Even when Swann is drunk , he 's acting a great actor drunk . Self-destructive as Swann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first see this wasted dude , he is n't wearing a watch , but he arrives for rehearsals on the dot . He honors his commitments , as he honors his debt to Benjy . Swann is a pro , and wants to work , just as King Kaiser does . King is a star because he 's funny , and so he has got to be funny . Alan Swann knows that as a romantic-daredevil hero it 's his job to make people fall in love with him . Each in his own area is a cock of the walk , and in the film 's climax they stand together as heroic equals and fight off their common en  --  emy . The picture is a triumph of casting  --  not least in giving us Lainie Kazan as the chipmunk 's mother . I never thought that I 'd be capable of saying anything complimentary about Lainie Kazan ; watching her sing and bulge on television , I have sometimes cow  --  ered  --  I 've wanted to throw a blanket over the set . But her fleshiness is per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her leering smile . Padded ( I assume ) and stuffed into her dress , this new Lainie Kazan goes beyond shtick ; when she talks about what 's real , she seems to become a real mother . And , powerhouse comic mama though she is , she 's  --  well , sexy . When Alan Swann , who has accompanied Benjy to Brooklyn for dinner , looks at her , there 's tribute in his eyes ; his expression says , " This woman is not just this kid 's mother . " The whole Brooklyn sequence is gen  --  erous-hearted ; everybody is ridiculous but no one is put down for it . And running through the film there are jokes that spin off each other . As a crooked union leader in a pin  --  striped suit who is trying to kill King Kaiser for repeatedly satirizing him on the show , Cameron Mitchell has great animal noises rumbling out of him . When the live " Comedy Caval  --  cade " is to start , King Kaiser is dressed in his own version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so far you could fly with them . Then he becomes confused and begins to think it 's the Musketeers routine that 's coming up . Talking out loud to herself , the wardrobe mistress ( Selma Diamond ) honks , " He thinks he 's in the wrong costume every week . " But it turns out that King is right to be confused , be  --  cause inadvertently the union-crook routine and the swashbuckling skit merge . The jokes are good , but it 's Peter O'Toole 's Swann  --  the film 's wild card  --  who makes it memorable . I ca n't think of another major star , with the possible exception of Ralph Rich  --  ardson , who would have the effrontery ( about what great actors should allow themselves to do ) to bring this sly performance off  --  and Richardson did n't develop this kind of funky dar  --  ing until he was too advanced in years for it to be romantically effective . O'Toole and Linn-Baker almost bring off a **27;6704;TOOLONG se  --  quence in which Swann takes Benjy to the Stork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoring fan ( Glo  --  ria Stuart , as deep-bosomed as ever , and , except for what looks like a gray , elderly-lady wig , nearly as beautiful ) . He understands what his romantic persona is , and he plays it immacu  --  lately , sweeping the woman into his arms and waltzing with her . Though the Club scenes end in a sloppy hit ( the usual tray of pastries gets spilled ) , O'Toole 's tone is so sure that the waltzing episode does n't become maud  --  lin or self-congratulatory . Swann is always aware of the im  --  pression he 's making ; when he enters a room , his feelers are out . He enjoys living up to the public 's dream of him ? his courtliness is part of his sense of the fitness of things . But this same man drinks out of cowardice and is in absolute terror when he realizes that the TV show must be done live , in front of a studio audience and twenty million people at home . Benjy per- suades him to go on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie heroes if he did n't have some of that courage in him ; by the end , Swann has justified Renjy 's idolatry . Maybe this movie is so satisfying be  --  cause it believes in what it 's saying : that stars have the heroism to do things most people could n't do  --  that there 's a reason these heroes are he  --  roes . You can almost see Richard Ben  --  jamin ( part Benjy himself ) grinning , his sheep 's eyes wet with admiration for Peter O'Toole , who does the equivalent of pratfalls on his face  --  smacking himself against walls and floors  --  and then may do something so foxy-subtle that some of the moments between Swann and Benjy transcend comedy and become fable . The plot appears to be casual  --  even a hit scatty  --  yet when you think the movie over , the layers of reference in the script come together . They chime the way they do in the best-constructed farces , and it 's a very pretty sound , especially when they chime ironically . Sy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's success ? how do they feel when at the climax of the TV show everything crashes and the script is discarded , and the studio audience goes berserk with laughter ? King gets an ovation . Imag  --  ine what it will be like on Monday when he walks into the writers ' office and says " Top it . " ACTORS who have labored to learn the rudiments of their pro  --  fession must want to kill the potential teen idol Matt Dillon , the open-faced young star of " Tex . " He 's a " natu  --  ral , " who takes the camera with the baffling ease of a puppy . He does n't apply any particular sexual heat in this movie , and he is n't crafty , like James Dean  --  there are no Method manner  --  isms , no affectations of any kind . From the way it looks , he just uses the sweet starry radiance that nature gave him , and smiles his relaxed , all-Amer  --  ican-sweetheart smile . Even his gift for baby-macho comedy seems part of the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the result of study  --  ing technique , but it works better on camera than most trained acting does . Viewers can feel they 're in direct con  --  tact with this luminous kid . The only thing his performance lacks is tension ? that 's what 's usually missing in the performances of naturals  --  but the movie is n't conceived in terms that require it . ( I imagine that a director who wanted tension and excitement would n't have much trouble getting it out of Dillon if he were n't playing such a nice boy . He was n't this down-home yokel in " My Bodyguard , " " Over the Edge , " or " Little Dar  --  lings . " ) " Tex " is oddly quiet , tepid , soft . At times , I was n't sure whether the Okla  --  homa locations were hazy or the cine  --  matographer ( Ric Waite ) was in some personal , watery-pastel fog . The movie has no strong images ; every  --  thing is flattened out . And Tim Hunter , making his debut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily , his modest , amateurish ap  --  proach comes across as integral to the material , which is an adaptation that he and his writing partner , Charlie Haas , did of one of the four novels by S. E. Hinton that became favorites of teen-agers in the seventies . When Su  --  san Hinton ( who appears here in a hit as the typing teacher ) began writing , she used her initials on her books be  --  cause she was afraid that high-school boys would n't accept stories about their adolescent travails if they knew that the writer was a girl . Now in her thirties , she was only sixteen when she wrote the first , " The Outsiders , " which Francis Ford Coppola has filmed , also with Matt Dillon  --  it is to be released before Christmas . ( Coppola is working on a movie based on another Hinton novel , " Rumble Fish , " again with Dillon . ) Tex , an affable , unformed kid , walks with his arms out , away from his body , as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a prankish but harmless fifteen-year-old who loves his horse , Rowdy . He and his serious-minded eighteen-year-old brother , Mace ( Jim Metzler ) , are pretty much on their own  --  their mother is dead , and their father is off on the rodeo circuit . There 's no way of citing what happens in this movie ( Tex loses Rowdy , Tex be  --  comes involved with a drug dealer , Tex intercepts a letter , Tex learns a secret about his parentage , etc. ) without making it all sound like an **30;6733;TOOLONG  --  snappin ' -at-his-rear-end joke . The plot is just one damn thing after an  --  other going wrong for the boys , and a lot of the film 's insights are socio  --  babble , junior division . But an amia  --  ble , unforced good humor takes the curse off all this . Hunter 's major con  --  tribution as a director is that he allows Dillon 's mysteriously effortless charm to shine , and Dillon , who has a gift for expressing confused and submerged shifts of feeling , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and stronger  --  boy . ( We may feel that we 're actually seeing the growth pro  --  cess . ) The director does n't do as well by some of the other performers  --  he keeps them on one emotional key throughout . There 's an unrelieved performance by Ben Johnson as the heavy  --  a rigid-minded , prosperous citizen who does n't want the no-ac  --  count Tex hanging around his kids ; he does n't even know that Tex has a crush on his daughter ( a lively , smart performance by Meg Tilly ) . And as the older brother , who takes out his own frustrations on the screw-up Tex and is like a strict , nagging parent to him , the promising Jim Metz  --  ler ( who has the handicap of looking too old for the role ) is monotonously harried . If Metzler had been encour  --  aged to lighten up now and then , or even if he were different with Tex from the way he is with other people , he 'd be a whole lot more convincing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a high-school-age mother and in Bill McKinney 's per  --  formance as the boys ' rodeo-bum fa  --  ther whom we learn not to judge too harshly . There are little " life lessons " all the way through  --  this is an old-fashioned kids ' movie ( and I 'm not sure what it 's doing in the New York Film Festi  --  va ) . Yet it creeps up on you  --  the way , I 'm told , Hinton 's books do . The naivete has its own kind of emotional , fairy-tale magic . Too bad that there 's nothing in the very likable " Tex " to make it linger in the mind  --  it 's vi  --  sually so fuzzy that it drifts away like a TV show . ERIC ROI-IM  --  R 'S " Le Beau Ma  --  riage " ended just when I start  --  ed to get interested , and when I hoped we might find out something about the heroine ( Beatrice Romand ) . A bright young working girl who is studying for her Master 's in art his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual experience . At the beginning of the film , she breaks off an affair with a successful painter , be  --  cause he 's married and she is weary of the complications , weary of freedom and insecurity . Twenty-five now , she decides she wants marriage ; she wants to be taken care of and to make a home for a man and have children . But site pursues this aim in an inexplicable way : she meets a lawyer whom she decides is her type , and she goes after him so briskly and transparently that she might seem a madwoman , except that her obsession is mundane . It 's such a dumb little obsession that there 's no passion in it , and she 's an orderly little campaigner  --  watching her lay siege to this man is like watch  --  ing someone arrange his desk . Roh  --  mer , who wrote the script , never gives us a clue to why the attractive Sabine does n't draw upon her knowledge of men to be more elusive and less forth  --  right about her intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . She puts herself in a pitifully exposed posi  --  tion , and she 's so stubbornly deter  --  mined to marry this man , whom she hardly knows , that she goes through a series of humiliations before she aban  --  dons the chase . What Rohmer is up to is basically cuteness , but with a measured tone . The film is full of glib , precise chatter and the clickety-click of Sabine 's high heels ; it 's a " nicely made film , " and you 're aware that everything in it is intentional to the last nuance . And during Sabine 's hounding of the law  --  yer his embarrassment is calibrated very skillfully . But Sabine 's willful stupidity is preposterous , and the whole conception of the film rests on our recognition that its premise is prepos  --  terous . ( That 's the only kick the film has . ) When Sabine abandons her delusion , she smiles at herself as if she 'd had a victory  --  as if she 'd shown that man a thing or two . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  gesting the old ponderosity that woman 's nature ca n't he fathomed . Beatrice Remand , who was enchant  --  ing as the young teen-ager in Roh  --  n-lees " Claire 's Knee , " is initially dis  --  appointing . But as the movie proceeds she regains some of that enchantment . In several sequences , she seems to light up and grow beautiful in front of our eyes . And , since we see her suffering , she becomes poignant  --  we want Sa  --  bine to come to her senses . And at the end , when she does , and there is the suggestion of a new candidate for her affections , I , for one , wanted to see her play the game right . I wanted to see her when she was in control of herself ? maybe in counterpoint to what she had done when she was direct and honest and utterly impossible . What we have witnessed seems only the first act . But it 's all we get , and though the end has a teeny twist , it 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's specialty . His sen  --  sibility would be easier to take if he 'd stop directing to a metronome . ? PAULINE KAEL
