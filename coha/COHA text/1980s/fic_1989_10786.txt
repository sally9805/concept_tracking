different life . But she never saw Ellen 's terror , and so her nature stayed intact . Ellen would wake in the night and see the moonlight fallen on the bare floor like a wafer , like a slice of mirror , an oval of white gold . She 'd look at it for portent , but it gave her back only her own fear . What she 'd despised in her life grew , in apprehension of its loss , now dear to her . She 'd never traveled to a city . What would happen to her in New York ? To her father , she would be as dead , and he would be as silent as the dead to her . The mother would be silent too , only just alive , in the dark stupor she 'd grown into . And suppose , Ellen would think , her eyes wide open as if they were propped on stalks , suppose I do n't succeed and make the money that I need for my mother ? She saw herself locked in a bedlam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragging herself home through streets that swarmed with thieves . She could be hurt or robbed or cheated . And she saw her mother , sitting by the window , asking for her , calling her by name . She 'd never leave , she could n't . She 'd been deceived . It was Delia who deceived her , then had forgotten her , then married , and had left the sister 's grand house , where there would have been room for both of them to live . And in her father 's store , she 'd tie her apron on , feel the cool coins between her fingers and the satisfying thump as they would drop down in the till . And she would think : Why leave ? Her father 's silence , and his fear , she 'd lose that prize as well . Then she would hear the words of Marin Monahan . " Tommy-love , " she 'd say . And Ellen would think : I will leave this . I will take the mother ; you , Marin Monahan , will die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed alone . Everyone in town had turned against Thomas Costelloe , his own family and Marin 's too . Behind his back people called him adulterer , and usurer , and thief , though he stole nothing : all hisp101money he had earned from his intelligence and his hard work . She 'd not let anybody say a word against her father . If they tried , if anybody tried  --  the townspeople , her ax-faced aunt , one of the nuns at school  --  she 'd turn to them the proud face that was his face . They would be silenced . She wanted the job of his punishment for herself ; she 'd not let others share in it . She had n't a friend in the town now , only Anna Foley , who 'd asked on Ellen 's sixteenthbirthday , " When is it that you think you 'll make the trip ? " Would she have left if the bees in the church had n't so terrified her ? Their noise was the clamor of her fear , the drone of her entrapment . Their stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in church , the first day of their swarming , she 'd broken into a sweat ; each movement terrified her . But what appalled her most was her sense of being alone in her terror . No one in the pews around her seemed to fear the horror she could see about to strike them all . They moved their lips ; they knelt , and sat , and rose again ; they understood or did not understand the Latin . They did n't break and run ; they did n't search for cover . Kind- and stupid-faced as the sheep on the hill outside , or unperturbed as stone , they formed a ring she could n't break or break into . Outside the church , the priest who called her " Ellen dear " and never felt the duty to bring the mother the sacrament joked with the young mothers and wondered at the weather . In those nights she woke in terror at the sound of swarming in her dreams . But she did n't leave for that . Her anger drove her out , anger at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . They had done nothing to prevent the horror , but it had been prevented . Her idea of justice had been mocked ; they thanked God for the mockery . She could n't wait to leave them . She wrote to Delia saying she would come and Delia wrote back with information about her passage . She sent lists of prices and departures . The father never came to the stone house now.  |p102It  was easy to deceive him . Anna Foley paid her brother from her own wages to bring back the trunk that Ellen bought at Gort , and then to drive Ellen to Cork in the dog cart . Coolly , Ellen did all the things that needed to be done . She wrote to Delia ; she arranged her passage and her papers . She was nearly seventeen but looked much older . Yet the day before she was to leave , when she saw her father 's back in the town for what she knew would be the last time , the pain she felt was like a spike through the center of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope of future relief . She longed for the father 's back , his boots , the harsh tweed of his jacket . She would not forgive him ; he was a danger to her . Yet she knew these things of his were all she treasured ; she longed to give herself up , to be carried on that back like a child , the weight of her life no longer her own , but a man 's . I-Icr father 's . " No use in staying any longer , " Anna Foley said , sensing the impatience of her brother 's horses . The mother looked out on the deadened grasses , did not look at her daughter . And the child 's heart in Ellen 's breast cried out , " Mother , tell me I ca n't leave you . " But the dead eyes would not turn towards her , nor the hand return the pressure she applied . She left by moonlight and the countryside she hated was saturatedwith beauty . The invisible meadows loomed in her mind . I Icr feet ached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes ; she made herself desire nothing of what she passed . The light came up as they approached Cork City . By the time they were in Queenstown , it was morning . Anna 's brother left her , silent , as he had been since she 'd known him , on her own with her trunk at the office of the steamship line . Too frightened to talk to a city person , he took tail and left her by herself to sort out her business . And she was glad to see him go ; his country boy 's sense of inferiority was right : he was a lesser mortal . It was her first time in a city , but she felt that she was born to it . She liked the bustle of the quayside , the forms she must fill out , and herself in the tumult , her own fixity within the moving crowd.  |p103On  the ship , she kept entirely to herself . She watched the other girls , who flirted and ate oranges , showing their large white teeth as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torment the men . She watched them run upstairs and downstairs , share their biscuits and their mother 's baking , speculate about the rich passengers , and look up longingly at the first-class deck . She would have none of it . She stood out on the second-class deck , letting the cold wind hurt her . And thought of her mother , sitting , noticing nothing , and the father 's high , proud back that she would never see again . She 'd be interrupted in her thoughts by the foolish buzzing around her , the ridiculous girls talking , their words in the air around her when she stood out on the deck or when she tried to sleep . That buzzing that she hated . Nothing she could distinguish . But a danger to herself , that thing she was by herself , apart from other people , that thing that people had to keep their distance from . Throughout her life she 's had to fight against that buzzing , keep herself from it , tell the truth about it : it 's a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know : who you are , what the truth of the world is . It makes you forget what 's important . Insistent , confusing , trivial : never going beyond itself , doubling back upon itself , thickening and crying out . Listen to me . Me . That clear call from the outside world , the horn note sounded through bright air , the music that rang out , pointed , singular , it could so easily be lost in the buzzing , the swarm . You could so easily forget who you were , that large acts were possible , that the world could change , you could change , could get away . All her life it 's been around her ; she 's had to fight it using all her streftgth . The hateful buzzing of the bees in Knock James Church that no one told the truth about or knew enough to fear . Lying in her bed , a ninety-year-old woman , her hair on her shoulders in the thin braids her granddaughter has plaited , she mutters against the girls aboard the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she curses them all . The fools in her life that have crowded her , have buzzed around her . They 're round her again , buzzingp104voices , words said by whoever they are straightening her bedclothes , putting tubes into her mouth , her sex , taking her blood , making her c.rt when she ca n't bear to eat , when she would like to be simple , empty , easily taken up into death , but they wo n't let her , they wo n't let her alone , they never have , she 's had to fight them . All her life . She 's v.rnglurshed them sometimes , she 's been free of them , felt herself grow straight , become a bare branch against a brilliant sky , a spire pointing upwards , a lance , the dark horizontal stroke beneath a column of correctly added figures . She sees with satisfactionthat her hands and arms are bone ; the sharpness of her body is a source of pleasure to her . She will raise her bone hand to anybody who Comes near her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms . She will keep herself untouched . The touch of anything on her skin now is agony . They know it and keep on touching her . " Do n't touch me , " she keeps saying . They do n't listen . She would like to die . But she refuses to become only her death . At night on the ship she heard them crying for their mothers . She hated therm for that . Grown girls , she said between her teeth , crying like babies . They 'll never make it in America . She created for each of them a separate dire end : for each of them a fate : drunk , slattern , streetwalker . She thought that in a few months , she 'd pass them on the street and not give them the pennies that they begged for . Not a cent to any of them . Not a one of them . Not a single one . She is horrified by her physical weakness . She has n't liked her body . Times with Vincent , though , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . She allowed him to unseal her ; it is his fault now that life spills out of her , spills over into death . She wishes herself intact . She curses Vincent for the thing he did . Whyp105did she let him ? She wants a stone now for a body , smooth , a weapon , closed . Now her body keeps nothing back . The buzzing now is able to enter through her openness , travel through her blood into her skull , confusing everything , eating away the healthy living matter of her brain . She ca n't distinguish and she can not recognize . Out of her mouth come filthy warnings . Words she does n't know she heard but understands . It must be stopped ; she must tell all of them . She says the filthy things about the bodies of all men . Their filthy hands and mouths and hidden parts they show as if it were their glory . They do it to you and you lie in pools of blood . Your life goes out of you because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she does not know who . But no one understands her . She says the wrong things . She remembers now . The faces around her can not understand her words . When she says , " Bring me my glasses , " they bring her a toothbrush , water , a handkerchief , a pill . When she throws it at them , knowing they 're trying to trick her , they say , " You asked for this . You asked for water . " She tries to find the word for glasses . She shines the light of her mind into the store of words and looks in the place where she sees the image of her glasses . There is no word there to go with the picture . Darkness . What was the storehouse of her words , stocked , overflowing , is a dusty emptiness . There are no words that name the things she sees . She shines the light of her mind backwards and forwards on the shelves of objects that she means to name . The light searches . Backwards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone had done this to her as a punishment . But now she understands . There are no thieves or punishers . Nothing has been stolen or kept back . Everything is simply , for no reason , gone . She is remembering the boat now . She remembers landing , but she ca n't remember what she saw : the buzz around her took her up , so she saw nothing , barely heard her name , knew only thatp106she 'd been let through . Her father had n't sent the word ahead about her . No one in America had learned she was a thief . Delia was there to meet the boat . With Jimmy Flaherty , her husband , born a fool like Delia , but good-natured like her too . That 's it , she remembers now . She wanted to forgive them for their natures . For not looking at the truth . For Delia making her say all these years : " Look at this , Delia , look at it now . " From childhood she 'd had to push the truth under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see . She calls out Delia 's name . She hears Delia 's name in the room . She 's done it , it 's the right name , fitting the face she sees in her mind . The buzzing stops ; the fog lifts . She remembers objects of the past and has the names of them . She remembers the kind of things she liked to look at . Things seen best from far away , or set apart from other things surrounding them . She sees postersslapped up against a wall : MEETING TONIGHT  --  FUN FAIR  --  VACCINATIONSFOR DISTEMPER . She sees brass numbers on a black door . A steel bridge . A steep-roofed house . She tries to make her mind stay with these things . If she can do it , she can break out of this dead light . The light she always hated is the envelope containing her whole life now ; it is all she sees . As a girl , she 'd hated the tall conifers outside the house her father had built to hide her mother . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick growth devoured light . She 'd run , as a girl , to get away from those trees , out to the place on the road that opened up , where beech took over , larch , and the hawthorn began . Now there is no breaking out . The distorted light that wo n't allow her to distinguishone thing from another , that wo n't let her say : This thing , and that , and then the other  --  is the only light available to her . And yet she fears the loss of it . She 's not ready to relinquish herself to what she knows will follow . Darkness . Silence . The end of everything that is . If she could see a face around her she could put a name to ! But there is no familiar face . The objects merge and lose distinction . The fog covers over . The buzzing begins again . She 'll never findp107it now , that thing she wanted . She slips back ; she feels tears coming ; she has lost the thing she had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . She always had to keep telling Delia everything . She did n't understand a blessed thing . But sometimes Ellen was grateful to her . Delia had seen the mother and been silent . In the town , in the stone house of the mother 's shame , and after in America . So there was that . But Delia did too much , Ellen could n't stand that , she could never stand it . Delia cried too easily ; she laughed too loud . You could never get her to sit still and just look at a thing or listen long enough to get it right . The nuns were after her for it every minute . Delia 'd be twisting in her seat , fiddling with her hair , examining her nails , her skirt , her handkerchief . She 'd be wiping her eyes after a fit of laughing , with a fit of weeping on its heels . She 'd be up getting you something : a cup of tea , a biscuit , a cardigan . She 'd open a window for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . No stillness . Vincent was the one for that . He could be still and listen to a thing and get it right . Bring up an angle of a thing you had n't thought of . But never Delia . She wants to rise up so she can correct Delia . Then she remembers : Delia is dead . She wants to rise up against her old friend 's death . And then she understands : she ca n't rise . They 've strapped her in . That 's it , she remembers now . They 've tied her up . A prisoner . A head of cattle . She wo n't let them make her an animal . She 'll strike at them now . They ca n't keep her down . She feels that , even dead , Delia needs her . Needs her to hold on to the image of her face so she wo n't be swallowed up in darkness . She 's impatient now with Delia 's calling out to her , needing her to pull her back , to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always needed help , alwaysmucked up her life , always needed pulling out . Always Delia came to Ellen . At the Presentation convent : " Cripes , I 've lost my Latin , I ca n't find my Rosary , I 've spent my mission money , El , I 'm in the soup . " Delia that everybody liked . The yellow curls , pinchable cheeks , bottom asking for a man to slap it , round whitep108arms . Too free , too thankful . The nice children she could not keep fed . Tears then . " I 'll have to give the youngest up . I 'll have to send him to the orphanage . I have n't any choice . " " I 'll take him for a while . You 'll not be sending him to any nuns . A nice boy , Delia 's Tommy . Grateful like his mother . Nicer than her own . Her own had hated it that she 'd brought in a child to live with them who was n't of their blood . They 'd grudged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clothes , every kind word from her or Vincent . That was the girls . Did John ? No , he could n't have . John had been kind . Her girls were never nice . Vain , primping , thinking only of themselves . And supplicating . Do this for me . Give me that . Their greedy voices . Their refusal to take part in life . No , that was Magdalene . Theresa did n't ask for things . Theresa refused . I 'll take nothing from you , she 'd said , turning from the breast at six months , drinking from a cup to spite her mother . Vincent saw none of it . " They 're good girls . Be a little softer with them . " One a coward and the other heartless . Lacking the important thing , both of them , lacking what was needed . What would count . Life . They were n't interested in life . It was n't just that they were girls . Cam was n't like them . Cam was like Bella , her real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Why is it Delia 's face she sees when it 's Bella she wants ? The both of them are dead ; , why is it Delia 's face that comes ? Bella is somewhere in the fog . Among the other dead . She 's furious at Delia for taking the place she wants to give to Bella . It 's Delia 's fault , just as it had been Delia 's fault that Ellen 's first job had been in service . Delia with her greenhorn 's fear , her hiding out among her kind , her terror of the first thing not out of the same bog she came from . " My Jimmy has a cousin has a friend , says there 's a place . All ready for you , El , you 'd never have a moment 's worry . " Of course , she took the place , grateful as she was to Delia , and wet behind the ears , not knowing one thing about America , re/lying on Delia and Jimmy for advice . As good advice as she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she arrived , or Margaret , who was just six months . She 'd never get over the disgrace of it . Even the words themselvesshameful : " in service . " And why should she serve ? Cleaning the shit of people she was better than . " But , El , you 've such a lovely job , " Delia would say . " Mrs. Fitzpatrick 's lady 's maid . I 'd give my eye teeth for it . Any girl would , Ellen . All the lovely stuff , the clothes , the hairbrushes . Tell me about those hairbrushes again . " " I 'll not talk about the nonsense one more time to you . They could clothe and feed a family for a year , those hairbrushes . " She gave Delia the look she put on when she wanted Delia to know she had been stupid . She did it when she felt the rage coming on her , rage that she could do nothing about the circumstances of the world that held and choked her and kept back her life . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing , leave that woman , come back to the stone house , cure her mother with his living there . Make her mother beautiful , make her sing . Make up for the blood . Make up for the body that would not hold . The failing body , all the parts of it that must be hidden , covered up . That was her job for Claire Fitzpatrick : hiding , covering , so that the woman could appear before the world , walk down the dark staircase , a woman in civilization , covered up and holding in . She hated the lie of it . Service . She was in service to the clothing and the body of a fool . She was good at it . " The hairbrushes , Mrs. Fitzpatrick . " Claire Marie Jameson Fitzpatrick . Wife of James . Mother of James , William , John . All of them gone to their graves old men . None taken from their mother untimely . Claire Fitzpatrick . She was a machine with moving parts : legs , organs , pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were useful , most of which were waste . Her whole life was about her body : to preserve , to ornament her body , more important , to conceal the nature of it from men 's sight . " Tell me about the hairbrushes , El , " Delia had pleaded . She 'd have liked to throw them through the glass , that was it about the hairbrushes . She dreamed of a clean break , silver , glass , the window frame gaping shamefully like a ruined mouth , the ragged hole unstable , dangerous , glimmering in the clear morning sun . And the brushes themselves , lying on the sidewalk . Would anybody pick them up ? Step on them ? Sell them for money or trade them in ? Who are you to call me by my name ? Ellen . She was Ellen to any of them . They were not her betters . No . Not one of them was . The hairbrushes with their patterns of leaves  --  acanthus , laurel  --  pressedor cut into the metal , was it ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all her life Claire Fitzpatrick , and the women like her , had not done their own hair . So what would it matter to them , the weight of the brushes ? The arms lifted above the thick hair were servant 's arms . Each morning as she dressed her own hair , Ellen thought how glad she was to have it , not Claire Fitzpatrick 's . Her hair was a pleasure to her . Smooth . She 'd pull it so it lay straight against her skull . She loved the fineness of it , loved taking it , forming it into a roll , pinning it low against her neck . She could imagine the pleasure it must be to look at , that thick knot of hair against the white skin of her neck . She 'd loved her hair . And Vincent had loved it . Lovely moments they were , he would take the pins out of her hair , sometimes he 'd kiss each of them as he took them out , then lay them down , always in perfect rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his nature . He respected tools . Hairpins , he tried to tell her once , were tools . She doubled over laughing . She 'd tease him for it , his laying the pins in rows , call him " the engineer . " But it was lovely , whenp111the last pin would be taken out and then there was a moment of real stillness when the hair would hold of itself its own shape , and then it would fall , wonderful , onto her shoulders . He 'd take her hair in his hands , kiss the smooth hair he loved and kiss the places of her body . She allowed him everything . He understood , he learned of her . His hands , his mouth learned . He knew . Claire Fitzpatrick 's hair was dreadful . Coarse and rio color , not a hint of sheen , no smoothness , to arrange it was to battle with it . And Ellen had clever fingers , she could do things with the rough , unpromising material , quicker than the others . Claire Fitzpatrickpraised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd been brought up to it . Her father , Owen Jameson , had made the money they lived off in his business , furs it was , she 'd never known exactly . The hidden sources of the Irish money . James Fitzpatrick 's father 's money , too , came from a source that no one spoke of . James himself was a great lawyer , he 'd a way with money , so even the Protestants took his advice , although it stuck in their throats . Claire and James Fitzpatrick . Both of them brought up thinking themselves royalty . The Jesuits , the Madames of the Sacred Heart , the dancing classes for the children of the wealthy Irish so that they might mate . They 'd known each other from their cradles , Claire and James Fitzpatrick told Ellen a million times , as if it were a smart remark . It made her sick . " I see you 're a good girl , Ellen , and a clever one , " Claire Fitzpatrick would say , smiling at Ellen in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet Mrs. Fitzpatrick 's gaze . " Mind that the one does not get in the way of the other . " And she 'd quote her a poem about the Virgin Mary that was supposed to be clever because the BVM was never mentioned : And was she clever in her wordsHer answers quick and smart ? We know not : we know of the secret love For her son in her heart.  | " I understand from the others you have a quick tongue in your head , and find yourself ready with an answer . But remember , Ellen , a girl in your position can lose everything by forgetting who she is . " " Yes , madame , " she would say , refusing in her resoluteness to meet the eye that searched , demanded that she meet it in the glass . I know who I am . And where I 've come from . She longed for the relief of the abuse that could come from her own mouth . My father , a gentleman . My education , the Presentation Sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these moments , young and running , singing , lifting the towel on the bread dough as she checked its rising . But then it would come to her , the real truth of her mother , silent or gibbering , an animal , no woman now , bearded , with lifeless eyes . Ellen had feared that any slip , any faint hint of her past would reveal the truth of her mother to Claire Fitzpatrick 's eye . So she remained above reproach and when Mrs. Fitzpatrick questioned her about her past she made up what she knew the woman wished to hear : the small farm , the countless brothers , cheerful sisters , stoical hardworking father , and her sainted mother , who slaved for the family but was never too busy for a laugh . " You must think of me as your mother now , " Claire Fitzpatrick would say from time to time , in love with herself for her good heart . " Yes , madame , " Ellen would reply . The perfect servant with her eyes kept down because of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart : " I 'd slap the face of you for that suggestionif there was a way on earth I could . I 'd tear out your ugly hair . I 'd leave you here , bald and disfigured from the blows of my fist on your face . You 'd be unable even to find your underclothes , so little do you know the workings of your own life . Never dare to speak of yourself and my mother in one breath . You are unworthy to kiss the hem of her garments . The strap of her sandals you are unworthy to loose . " Ellen is lying strapped to her bed , over seventy years later , andp113refusing to become the one event , her death . Refusing to forget . No one remembers but herself and if she lets go of the memory , it will be lost forever . The memory of the young mother singing , her bare arms covered in soapsuds to the elbows , singing as she scrubs her husband 's shirts . The clever fingers making shapes out of the dough : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget , she will become nothing , will disappear , will be homeless in the universe , wandering , her arms outstretched , rootless if I lose the picture of her . Do not speak to me , Claire Fitzpatrick . Do not say that you would be my mother . Did you lie in blood , the children of your life lost to you not once , but again and again ? Your husband 's money , your father 's keeps you from your body . That is its purpose , so the men can tell themselves : The bodies of women which we covet we will never know the truth of ; because of our wealth you must let us believe that what we feared has ceased to be . Cover , muffle , pare , remove , keep down the evidence , the secret smells . That was her job , they paid her for it , used her talents for it and her wits and her dexterity , her nimbleness and memory , her understanding of the place of things . And of her own place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richness of the house , and felt grateful to be there , grateful for the woods and porcelains , the dinner gong with its somber , reproachful tone . Her early pleasure fed her subsequent rage . She knew they counted on that pleasure . The homeless girl , the unhoused voyager , taking her solace from the house , taking the measure of her worth against its objects . They 'd counted on it , and in her case it had served them for a time . Until her understanding choked her and stopped her breath . People like Delia and Jimmy Flaherty were their meat . Their excitement when Matt Corrigan , chauffeur to the Fitzpatricks and a pal of Jimmy 's , suggested that Ellen present herself to the Fitzpatricks ' housekeeper , for they were looking for a ladies ' maid . An Irish girl they wanted , no French or English for them , no , they were that loyal , but a girl with breeding , like Ellen herself , who made a good appearance , spokep114well , and had her wits about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Matt Corrigan , thinking she 'd be impressed . She was ; he had been right to count on it . On him more than the others her anger fell . In her bed , old , dying , she curses Matt Corrigan . Then curses them all , their sense of gratitude and having been well situated . WE ARE OF THE HOUSE . WE ARE THE HOUSE . We count for something , as the house does ; we weigh , as it does . The greenhorn cod that kept them slaves . She 'd been taken in at first , because she had been frightened . Even now , her hands claws and her mind a fog in which she has misplaced her present life , she wo n't forgive herself that weakness . A slave 's weakness . She was not a slave . You must possess yourself . She 'd known that early . There must be a place , shored up , defended , reconstructed daily , where that thing that kept itself that was yourself , could stay intact . Fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it from the sight of others . You could not soften , open . You kept yourself held in . Then you belonged to yourself . " She kept herself to herself , " people had said about Ellen all her life . Resentful , not knowing it was her triumph . Weakness made you open up . Weakness and fear . You had to stop it happening . She thinks now , making her claw hands fists , what she has always thought , that it was living next to Delia , in the house with Delia , that gave her her first weakness . Delia with her tears , her fatness , her too-quick confidences , dreams , obedience , remorse . Her delight that Matt Corrigan thought so well of Ellen , her friend . The honor beamed back to her , to Delia . Matt had worked first with Jimmy Flaherty . He came by on the evenings he was free , when the Fitzpatricks did n't want him , in his uniform ( Livery , she corrected him , an ugly name , but call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his beer and tell them about the Fitzpatricks at the opera , what the cook had told him , what was eaten : champagne , canvasback duck . Mr. Fitzpatrick was the finest gentleman in all New York , he put the Yankees all to shame , they knew it . The finest houses in New York he 'd driven to . Later she knew thatp115he was wrong , they were n't the finest houses in New York , the finest houses in New York would not receive the Irish . How could he live among them and not know ? Matt had complimented her on how she poured the tea , her lovely diction , her white hands , her talent with a needle and the way she 'd write a letter for any of them , and read the papers from the government , and know the right way to reply . She 'd taken comfort in his praise . She curses him now for this comfort . All her life she 'd hated Matthew Corrigan , and he never knew why . Life in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lack of solitude , life lived among strangers . Unlike the Flahertys , she could never go back home . A criminal in her own town , she had escaped by night , with stolen money . If she put a foot in the town , her father would have her arrested . They could dream about going back , sing about it . How she hated them for every song , and every tender word that was denied her . " My mother died last spring / When Ireland 's fields were green / Snowdropsand primroses beside her bed . " Her throat closed up when she heard them , with their Irish mother songs . Would you like to know about my darlin ' mother ? Gibbering , a beast now in the darkened house my father built to hide her in , not a green field but desolation , dead grass and the colorless sharp choking weeds that can not and will not be cleared . My darlin ' father that would jail me if he saw his darlin 's face . So sing on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weep now for not having . She felt her shame amidst the other greenhorns and held it up against their sorrow . Families that wept to see them go and letters of lament . Come home and let me see your face before I die . She was the criminal among them . Only Delia knew . Ellen would die grateful to her for that . For all her foolish tongue , she 'd always kept Ellen 's secrets . But among the weeping sons and daughters who 'd been sent off with tears , with grieving , Ellen felt herself flayed . It made her credulous and grateful , grateful for the presence of Matthew Corrigan , who 'd no more mind than the horses he tended . Grateful to be told by first the housekeeper , then Mrs.p116Fitzpatrick herself , that she would do . She seemed a girl of promise , but she must work hard . The work was never hard . It was the nature of the life that killed her . All the lies that stopped her breath . The room they gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness was no burden to her , nor its size . She brought in small objects for pleasure : a postcard she liked , showing the harbor , and one handpainted one , a scene of Brooklyn Bridge ; a tin she 'd asked the cook for , Famous Cake Box ; a picture of a blonde child and a large black dog . It was the cast-off , the ragendednessthat was the room 's cruelty to her , and the sense that what was deficient could so easily be fixed . Nails for her clothes instead of hooks . The comforters stained , marked with the waters of who knew what life or what disaster . The mantel and the floor inadequately varnished , ready to splinter , to cause pain . At least the door closed : she thanked God for that . But it did n't lock . In time , when she thought she had her mistress 's favor , she asked : " Could a lock not be put on my door ? It would mean something to me . " Claire Fitzpatrick did n't hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our servants ' rooms are never locked . " Reminding Ellen of what she hated most , making her hate herself and all of them because she had forgotten or assumed it could be otherwise . She was a servant , what they wanted was that she would not be herself to herself , but lay herself out to them for their own use . The worst of it was living among the others . Coarse , ignorant , filthy girls , thinking themselves so great and fortunate . Matt Corriganthe king among them ; the undermaids , fighting for the joy of polishing his boots . The cook a drunk , the housekeeper a pious ninny , always pressing on Ellen holy pictures and novenas , urging her to thank God for her good situation , offering her suggestions about underwear as she offered her mints so strong you 'd kill your stomach with them . And all of them  --  the tradesman , the butcher'sboy  --  thinking they had the right to call her by her first name . The impudence , the theft of it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coldness was her joy.  |p117Delia  had begged to visit , wanting to see the inside of the Fitzpatrick house . " Maybe you 'd slip me up to the mistress 's room itself , one day when she 's out , El . I could take a look . " But Ellen never would . Her job meant something . She was paid to keep things concealed . The thought of Delia in the mistress 's room shocked her . It was Ellen 's place to keep back the intruder , the violating eye or foot , the hand that touched and spoiled . She knew her part in the conspiracy : it was her understanding of the nature of the human eye , that thing that leered and gaped and sought to steal the good of everything , that loved defilement and the ruin of a thing , her understanding of all that made her good at her work . She hated the fine lace , the covered buttons , the exact folds , the silk ribbons , veils , false flowers , the embroideries , the small stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet they were her province . She was honorable ; she valued , above all , her honor . Why would she let Delia into places that were not hers ? Why would she let her into the library , the dining room , let her finger the silver or the coffee set that stood out on the sideboard , the chintz draperies with their pattern of choked carnations , hollyhocks , chrysanthemums ? Why would she invite her friend ? She hated all those objects but they were not hers , and she respected separations . She would not let the trespassers trespass . So , when the day came that she could n't stick it , it was n't the disliking of the job itself that pushed her over , it was the sudden awareness that the Fitzpatricks , in paying her , thought they had bought her life . " Ellen dear , stay in today , I must ask you this favor . I would never insist , you know that , but my sister . . from Chicago .. very suddenly . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and all must pull our weight . . . . Three weeks she 'll be here , and her girls . She 's always been that way , thoughtless , perhaps , but charming . Very charming . Well , I must ask you this favor . . . . Your day off , I know . . . but stay today , and help me . . . . Nothing I can name right now , just to have you around . . . a million little things . "  |p118She  'd had no plans that day . It would have been an easy thing to give it up . But , seventy years later , she can feel what she had felt then . She raises the claw hand that will not obey her . Memory enlivens it , makes it quick-witted ; life flows through her arm . The memory of her refusal gives her back her biddable , compliant limbs . " I will not stay in , " she hears herself say aloud . " Surely it ca n't mean that much , " Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means I draw my breath outside your presence and your will . It means that there is justice and you too abide by it . Shining justice with its buckler and its shield . I want no part of mercy , womanish and yielding . I will live by justice . My day free from you you may not have . My life apart from you you may not have . My life . She did nothing on her days off . Walked . Bought thread , elastic . Rice powder she admired . Paper for her bureau drawers . Ink . Buttons . Throat lozenges . Not stamps . She was not one of those who needed to send money to the other side . To whom would she send money ? The mother sitting in the dark ? The father who would have her put in prison if he could ? To Anna Foley , she had sent her address . Just that . She had money for luxuries . She did not covet clothes . But hats , ornaments for her hair . Yes , those she liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved . The wide high avenues , their carriages and trees . She knew those avenues were not meant for her kind , except as far as they were meant to be the servants that kept the fine houses running smoothly . Invisiblyher kind held up the houses , were the stones of their foundations , their beams and props . But she did not begrudge the streets as she begrudged the rooms in the Fitzpatrick house . No , not at all . These avenues that were meant for the pleasure of the rich could do you good in spite of themselves . They gave hope ; your lungs filled with the rich air of them , your tired bones could let themselves enliven and grow light . She 'd walk downtown , among the busy men so full of import and real destinations , and the girls , younger than her they looked , bank clerks and secretaries , stiff with responsibility and pride.  |p119Among  them she 'd take a cup of tea in a shop , as they looked at her and knew her as not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices , she would languidly expand : Another cake , please , she would say to the cool waitress ; tired , she could tell , of ladies and their small appetites . She would walk farther downtown and see what she 'd been spared : the filthy tenements , the street-lived life , the bumptious children , the displayed life she hated , envied , feared . Gratefully , then , she 'd walk uptown , her packages secure in her bag , her feet that she was proud of sore in their well-made boots . Content , she 'd close the door behind her , watch the shadowsthickening on the wood floor , comforting , reminding her that she had hours left , hours when she must answer to no one . She would soak her feet . She 'd not give that up to please anyone . But what would have happened that day had she not , in her anger , run into Laura Fogarty ? Laura Fogarty , whom she had met a year before , when they were each sent by their mistresses to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms at the Gotham , a residence hotel on Madison and 89th . The rooms were weighted down with the sisters ' plush draperies , the tiny marble bowl up which climbed alabaster doves , the replica of the Leaning Tower of Pisa ( which she remembered from one of the nuns ' books at school ) , the cracked carved wood of the large chairs . Five ladies ' maids came there for a two-month course . The connivance of it . Now she makes a fist and brings it down , unsatisfying , on the white plastic arm of the bed . Where did that bed come from ? It was n't the bed she 'd shared with Vincent . She 'd never had a bed like it . She never would . Nor Vincent . Flimsy stuff they hated . Would not have it in the house . " Two months , " she remembered the Miss Berringers saying , " two months to learn the art of perfect care of Madame 's clothes . " Two months to listen to those old sticks , with their surprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like horses to get sugar , they smiled . Two months on brushing , folding , packing , invisibly mending . Buttonholes , handkerchiefs , pre/ventatives against the moth , or remedies against the mud that stubbornly adhered to Madame 's hem . " D'ye call yours Madame , then ? " Laura Fogarty had said . " I do , " Ellen had whispered , resisting conversation . " I would n't be caught dead . " After that , Ellen disliked her . But what if she had n't run into Laura that day , the day she had refused Mrs. Fitzpatrick , the day rage bulked up against her line of sight , as solid as a building ? " I 'm out of service and I thank God for it . You 're a fool if you do n't get out . A slave . Your life 's never your own , and what 's the use of living it that way ? " Ellen 's pleasure in the free time they 'd granted her became hateful from that instant . Why should she be grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to order her seconds , minutes . Surely this was every human 's right : each day to have some time alone . It was a dreadful thing , a terrible unnatural thing , she saw it now , to have your ear poised to answer a bell that tinkled  --  so genteel Claire Fitzpatrick thought , almost silent , she imagined . The slight , unobtrusive sound of wealth . You answered to a bell . Dogs did that , came not to their names but to the signal . The abasement of the name repeated constantly was as bad . " Ellen , I 'm tired to death , get my book , will you ? " A dozen feet away from Claire Fitzpatrick the book sat . But she would ring for Ellen to run up three flights of stairs rather than rouse herself to walk a dozen footsteps . " Ellen dear , help me with my sewing for the charity . I 'm perishing of boredom . And while you do it , tell me something of your life . " She made up lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trick , lying . A slave 's gratitude . Laura Fogarty said : " The lady runs my place is looking for a girl . You 're a good needlewoman , I remember . Throw your chains off . Come with me . " She followed Laura up a side street within sight of Union Square . The business signs were few , and her heart quickened top121see the famous name on the brass nameplate . Madame de Maintenant . Claire Fitzpatrick yearned one day to have a dress made by Madame de Maintenant , but knew it was beyond her . Ellen and Laura passed the row of carriages , walked down a stairway to the basement , proud , were let in by a woman prouder than them both who nodded merely when Laura said : " She 's a good needlewoman . She needs a place . " Ellen tries to sit up , but she ca n't ; she 's strapped . She ca n't remember the look of that old place . She sees shadows , gaps , then objects disconnected from each other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . The ornate black legs of some machine . She sees sleeves , a set of sleeves it was her job to put into a dress someone has made . She sees her own hands working with the sleeves . Her hands are real , they are palpable in the grasp of her eye . The room holds promise . She can recognize her hands . And a voice , severe , noting a fact . Answered by her own voice , noting another fact . Two girls , working together . Helpful to each other ? No . Contingent to each other . I will get you something you have dropped . Praise ? No . But later , the fierce , shy friendship of two girls , made up of adoration , mutual humility , a sense of honor , and momentarily the lifting of the curse that is their life : poverty , hard labor , the female sex . Now through her mind pass all the bodies she has been . The girl child running behind the easy body of her mother , the mother'sbody like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and painful in their joints , and the new arrivals : breasts , hair , blood , monthly pain . Grown used to that at last , the self lost , and herself a mother , who does not see herself a ship at ease in movement , but is disquietedby her unbalance and the shock , splash , danger-cry of giving birth . My body not my own but empty once again . The heavy softening : Where are the girl 's light limbs ? How have my breasts become this shape ? Did you , child , do this to me ? Take all that ? The veins , the feet , hardening like trees and growing roots . And now she once again has taken on a lightness . She hasp122become a leaf now , insubstantial to herself , in the light body of near death . She is remembering the bodies she has been . And yet she understands : at any moment to herself she always has been the one body . The lost body forever lost . But not the voices . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she has always . Bella . My friend . She calls out . Tries to remember : How did we first speak to one another . First in shame . Shame that they passed each day the other girl , the courageous girl , shamed that they said nothing , shamed by the girl 's brave eye . Ellen had been at Madame de Maintenant 's two months . She felt she 'd bettered herself ; she was delighted to be free of service , left alone , left to the silence of the workroom where she served . After work she could leave behind the person she was to them in that room , the wage earner , could take herself up once again , at no one 's beck and call . For a few hours each night she had quiet , she had what she desired of silence , emptiness , where the ideas could sift down , the sights turn over and over , stones , dry stones : The thoughts I have . Delia was living in West New York with Jimmy and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping Delia , Ellen had agreed to live with them , but she could n't stick it . The noise of the children , Delia 's hurt if Ellen was n't speaking to her every minute of the day , her hurt if Ellen closed the door , her timid knocking : " I 've got a cup of tea here for you . Would you just take a look at this paper from the government . . . . It worries me , this envelope . Does it look important ? Can it be Immigration ? We 've done nothing wrong . " Every brown or yellow envelope she thought was Immigration . That made Ellen furious . " It 's nothing , Delia . City water . Why would you think it was Immigration ? You 're a citizen , for God 's sake , have been since you married Jim . Fortunately , they were n't giving out intelligence tests then or they 'd have sent you on your horse forever as a fool . "  |p123Delia  cried when Ellen left them . One day she saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Room for Rent . " Her wages were quite good , and unlike other girls she had no family needing her money . She climbed the back stairs of Mrs. Devlin 's boarding house and was shown the dark room with a view of a garden , and , if you leaned out and the night was clear , a glimpse , like a strip of mirror , of the river . " That 's fine , " she told the landlady , hardening her heart to what she knew would be Delia 's pain . Delia was pregnant once again : she put it that way . She said : " You need the room . " " Oh , El , I ca n't believe it , " Delia wept , watching her friend pack , as if she were crossing the ocean , not a few streets . Jimmy Flaherty , jovial and addlepated as his wife , had helped Ellen with her things . So it was hers , the place she could close the door of , every night now if she wished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other boarders in the house were rough and loud ; she had nothing to do with them . The window of her room was cracked ; the water in her basin froze over in winter . But it did n't matter . She could put her own things around her . She could keep herself to herself . Her work at Madame de Maintenant 's did not displease her . She was valued , praised by the stout forelady , whom she despised for meanness . Mrs. Bellamy thought herself a lady , above them , but Ellen knew her for what she was : gossipy , ignorant , a creature fattened and made solid on her greed and pride in being above others . Ellen was praised and was not interfered with . Each day they were given lunch , a privilege , the forelady told them , each day , nearly tearful over the mistress 's generosity . " Look at the sandwiches , the tea carried to you . Where else would you be getting this ? Ladies : remember Madame every evening in your prayers and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name be first upon your lips , before your family even , for she gives you everything , and none of you know what she suffers . " When she disappeared , racked with emotion , into the glass office that was an island in the center of the room , from which she couldp124see them at every moment , see each thing they did , the girls would keep their eyes down on their lunches . No one would meet another'seye . But it was over lunch that she and Bella spoke , she and Ellen , who did n't know each other 's names . They sat together ; Ellen was pleased by the dark girl 's angry look . She liked somebodylooking as angry as she knew she was herself . Each day at lunch the dark girl 's hunched back hid the book she read as she ate , not looking at her food , not looking up . But one day , reading , not looking , she knocked Ellen 's full cup of tea onto the floor . Mercifully , nothing was soiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence , for it would cause a reprimand and any moment the forelady could roll towards them , seeing the spilled tea as proof of everything she always knew : they were uncouth , ungrateful girls ; they did not deserve a bit of Madame 's kindness , and they never would . Kneeling , acting with swift , efficient motions , they kept the damage from the enemy 's all-seeing eye . And their eyes met . Ellen , kneeling , said to the other kneeling girl , " Every morning on your knees let Madame 's name be first upon your lips , before , even , your family . " They could lose wages if the laughter that they recognized in each other 's eyes spilled out . They allowed their mouths slightly to twitch . Meaning : I single you out . After that , she got the courage from Bella Robbins to do what she wanted : bring a book to work . She knew the world , the times were terrible . The year was 1913 . Danger from Europe threatened the innocent Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . She wanted to read history . Not just the newspapers , which she devoured , but history . She found two books on the dustbin in the alley between Mrs. Devlin 's house and the Farley house to the right : she plucked them , frightened of the defilement of books cast out , of the books themselves . Two books , one brown-covered , one blue . The brown A Shorter History of Ireland . The blue : The Course of Positive Philosophy , by Auguste Comte . " Would you be reading these ? " she asked Mrs. Devlin.  | " Would it be any trouble if I took them ? " Mrs. Devlin shrugged , incredulous that a book could be of value . At night in her room , feeling that she stole grace , she read the books that she 'd found on the dustbin . She was unused to ideas : the reading was difficult . It was labor . Her mind strained , moving a heavy object . She cursed her mind . It was impermeable with stupidity . She cursed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious poetry , needlework ( that she was grateful for : it earned her living ) , cookery , the painting of china or of fans . Ideas they feared , and in the house she lived in with her mother in the dark , in shame and hiding , there was not one book . Not even the Bible , which in Ireland was thought dangerous , to be read only with the guidance of a priest . Although the ideas she tried to take in overmastered her , she was in love with them , and even when she beat her temples with her fists  --  it was impossible , she was too dull just after that , she would feel calm and honored by the grandeur of the enterprise she was allowed to have a part in . So , while the other girls ate quietly and decorously , talking of their families , their beaux , dress patterns , Ellen Costelloe and Bella Robbins sat in silence . They ate and read . For months , in silence , saying nothing of what they saw behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what would become of them if they were turned to speech . Ellen saw that Bella 's book was not in English . German , she thought . She saw the writer 's name , Schopenhauer , and the name abashed her . She was happy simply to know someone who could read a book by someone with a name like that . At the end of the day they walked out the door together , and wished each other good night . Respecting one another 's silence , knowing the treasureof the other 's anger , pride . And then there was the day when they passed the accusing girl . Sitting on Madame 's doorstep , saying to each girl who went in : " If you go in and do her work and take her money , you put inp126your pocket money soaked in blood . She owed my sister wages . She still does . For the honor of working for Madame Maintenant , " the accuser went on , " who could not pay her the so-careless customers , they did not pay ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , my sister went for months without her proper wages . Madame said she 'd pay her in the spring . For now , would she take half ? She would . Her shoes wore out ; she did n't buy new ones . My sister died of her old shoes . " Small , wild-eyed , mad , the girl cried out and the policeman was ashamed to move her . " Do not believe her , the disgrace of her , " said Mrs. Bellamy . Madame herself appeared , the first time any of the girls had seen her , a full figure and a beautifully coiffed head . She stood before them . Her carriage stupefied them all . She said , " It is my deepest joy to know my girls are working happily and well . " And then she disappeared above the stairs . After she left , the girls , discommoded as if by a royal visit , blushed and giggled . Cookies were sent down with tea . The girl on the steps was made to disappear . Three days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Ellen Costelloe and said : " I 'm worried sick about a war . And her words were a knife slicing the thick air of the room of women sewing . Women stitching fine , beautiful stitches , women ignorant as dirt , skilled women , making things for other women who need do nothing for themselves , the unreal dreamworkof the dresses of the period . Bella 's sentence let in life , breath , pulse , the whole world of ideas . It set the tone for the whole of their friendship . They did not , like other women , say to each other sentences beginning with the words " I love , I hate , I fear . " Ellen told Bella nothing of her mother , not until it was too late . And Ellen never knew her friend had been for years the lover of a married man until he died ( they were in their fifties ) and Bellap127tried to kill herself . Bella 's sister accused Ellen , " You must have known . " Bella did not forgive her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't believe her , what she told you . About why I did this . I do n't know why I did it . There 's no reason . I do n't know why I did . " Ellen allowed Bella , her cut wrists crossed on her bosom like a corpse 's , to see the face it had pleased them both to turn a thousand times towards the world . The face of their shared superiority , of their contempt : two girls above it all . " Who 'd listen to that dope ? " said Ellen . " If she ever had an idea in her head it would have to leave the neighborhood . Driven away by its own loneliness . " They said nothing more about the subject . Ellen never disbelieved the sister . She feared the depths of her old friend . Throughout their lives they gave each other names and information as other girls give each other pastilles , or open up their lockets , show their photographs . Bella would tell her about Spengler , Comte , German philosophers whose words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe in the religion of mankind . " All Bella 's family were atheists . Bella 's father , a tailor , and her mother , and all eleven of their children believed , they said , in the divinity of man . " Why do they invent pie in the sky except to keep your eyes off what 's in front of you , " Bella 's father had said . From Bella she first heard the sentence , " Religion is the opiate of the masses . " She heard the bees in Knock James Church ; that sentence could break up the swarm : it could dissolve the buzzing . " Religion is the opiate of the masses . " Bella 's family said sentences like that . Large sentences they were not afraid of . " To drink tea is not to hew wood . " " To cross a field is not to live a life . " Sometimes Ellen did n't know what they meant , but she was thrilled to hear the courage in them . The courage to make a sentence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew would do it . From Bella 's family she heard the words that madep128her see lives she had never known of . Hooves raised above the faces of women and their babies , dark modest girls torn apart by mustached brutes who said they had a right to , and a right to burn the towns . She heard in these stories the quiet of ruin , the silent aftermath , the departure of the men on horses , the respite till the next disaster struck . The Robbinses trusted her . They said she did n't seem like other Christians . She was pleased at that . She 'd never thought of herself as a Christian . A Catholic , yes , but " Christian " was a word for Protestants . To them , she knew , it was the same . Bella and Ellen preferred not sharing their time together with Bella 's omnivorous , hard-breathing family ; the warmth , drive , of all that life pressed on their leisure and they could n't talk . Their talks were dark , night-blooming , violent bouquets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to each other about anything on earth . Except they would not talk about themselves . They did not speak of men or love . As if a flag had been flung out between them : None of that for us . No time . Hunger to know the world consumed them . They felt their deprivation and all their lost time . Bella wrote to Ellen from a cousin 's in the mountains of upstate New York : What matters most is time is passing . Time is passing and everything is missed . We are not living . I have been thinking : girls must get a living wage and then a shorter workday and many more girls must begin to think . It is n't that they do n't want to think ; they are all too tired to think . Thinking makes you interested in life . To be interested in life makes you a thousand times better as a person . In the fog that is her current life Ellen sees perfectly the face of her friend Bella . She thinks of Bella in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little bows that did her chin , her face , no good . It made a mockery of all that seriousness , of thatp129understanding . She thinks of her friend 's mouth , lovely , the fine , neat teeth , bluish in some lights , like skim milk , but strong : you 'd think that they would last her . And the dark under her eyes so she never looked young or well . But the eyes themselves , the wonderful dark eyes . There were no eyes like that at home , so brown they had a touch of red in them , nothing like the brown eyes of animals , which were the only brown eyes in her childhood . You 'd look at Bella 's eyes and know there was nothing she could n't understand . And she would n't be likely to think well of a thing . She 'd fix her eyes on you , at first you would feel frightened . Some people never got over this , some people never relaxed around her . Delia . Vincent , too ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Vincent was always a bit frightened around Bella . Her hair , smooth and lusterless , collected into rolls around her ears . Ellen pitied Bella 's hair , the only thing to pity in this girl she worshipped as a creature far above her , yet who , miraculously , listened to her , was interested in her . They listened to each other . And she made Bella laugh . " The world 's a brighter place for you than me , " Bella had said to Ellen once . Wounding her to the quick . She wanted to say to Bella : Do you , my friend , not know me ? This laughter , these words of mine , my way of putting things that makes you laugh , and that I mean to make you laugh , do you imagine that I do this out of joy ? For pleasure ? That I do n't see as darkly as you see ? I have seen more than you know . The children , born unborn , blood , mess , on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother moaning : " How can I have done this . Why do I do this ? " My beautiful mother ( her thin fingers transparent almost when she held them to the light to show off , to admire her ring ) , my mother turning , before my eyes , into a man , an animal , in darkness , in the total darkness of her mind , gibbering words no one can understand , her feet in black men 's boots , like trees rooted , taking root . And in the pub where the money was made to send me to the Presentation Sisters , I have heard things , in the first days when my father would take me , thinking I did n't understand.  |p130I  have understood what men think : they wish nothing but misfortune to their neighbors . Every good thing for another is a blow to them . They crave a stupor , a calamity . Anything to break the rhythm of the life they strap themselves to like a wheel that turns and never stops . I have seen more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . In his bed . Her broad back I see , her thief 's mouth , her fingers thick with the life she lives and does n't even try to keep a secret . I know what they do . I stiffen all my life against them . I become a weapon . I become an eye , a glass , a fire burning up their pleasure . You think the world is a bright place for me ? I have always known . Men are brutal animals , the yellow teeth , the red eyes , and the damp , destructive breath . I see always in the darkness , in the silence . I keep it all in my mind , which , though not as good as yours , lets go of nothing . She never said anything like this to her friend . They talked endlessly of life at the workshop of Madame de Maintenant . It was crucial that they demonstrate to one another in minute detail . their knowledge of the workings of the place and their precise awareness of the injustices , tyrannies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they witnessed every day . Most important , they had to make clear to each other their contempt for the other girls , who believed themselves honored to be working in so fashionable an establishment and with so prized a clientele . So when the forelady , weeping in Madame 's name , asked would they not wait for their wages till the slack season was over and the so-forgetful clients paid their bills , the girls fluttered their honored agreement like sweet birds . Bella and Ellen said they would n't wait . " Fire us if you like , " they said to the forelady . " You 'll never get two as good as we are for the sleeves . " The forelady 's face turned red ; the other girls feared she would die of heart attack , of shock . None of them would join Ellen and Bella , who were not fired , but were no longer given tea . They reassured each other every day they were n't dupes , like other girls . Yet they did n't leave the workshop . They dreamedp131of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to would be worse . They stripped their dreams of the domestic with a devotion that was female in its thoroughness , as if they stripped a house for a spring cleaning . Their dreams came from their discussions at the Women 's Trade Union League , a club for working girls : internationalgovernments , living wages , decent work . Being female , they could not dream dreams without rooms . The rooms they saw were not rooms with warm , inviting beds , or round familiar tables , around which the beloved few gathered to be fed . The rooms of their dreams were large and public . Underheated meetingrooms , lecture halls , the daunting rooms of the new Public Library , where they were told ( but did not believe it , and feared to see for themselves ) they had a right to be . They saw themselves at the heads of audiences , crowds of women like themselves listening to them , acting on their words . Or they would listen and then act . The men in their dreams stood at lecterns , or beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important passages from crucial books . Streets were in their dreams . They walked the streets where trees flourished before them ; they walked across a bridge . The lights fell on the river in drops , wafers , coins . They leaned over the bridge , rested for a moment , talking , then went on . They walked along a boardwalk ; they could smell the ocean , it excited their talking , and encouraged their belief . They did not , in their dreams , talk to the young men in straw boaters ; these were not dreams with places in them for young men . They were different from the other girls they saw . But they would change the other girls . Outside the dream the girls around them did not change . And their notions of their new heroic selves were smashed not by thep132falling action of some fist , some whip , but by the silent power of the forelady and of Madame herself . At the Trade Union League , the organizers said : " It 's places like your shop that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Girls starving thinking it 's an honor . Wages almost as low as sweatshops . But a nice room , a fire , tea . " Ellen and Bella thought but did not speak of the young girl who sat on the stone steps demandingher sister 's wages , the girl whose eye they did not meet . They took with them the union cards , with the blank spaces for names and addresses . They tried to talk to some of the more friendly girls . But they were met with silent , fearful glances , or the genial upturned face of the non-listener . They decided they would put a card down at each place . Lying on her bed , Ellen remembers , though there is no act she can perform now , therefore no reason to fear action , strapped in her bed whose plastic armrests are the color of a poisoned shell ( This was never mine ) , even now she remembers her fear . She remembers lying in her bed at Mrs. Devlin 's , the street sights through her window : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . She was rigid in her fear . She remembers digging her nails into her palms for courage . She remembers saying to herself , fear making her organs light , acute , and lively : Tomorrow we will do it . And they did . On the dark wooden tables among the mix of threads , scraps , scissors , tissue papers , they placed down cards that said : I wish to become a member of the Women 's Trade Union League . They did not meet one another 's eye . Then , suddenly , one of the girls , one of the ones who most disliked them , rose , pretending she must show some work to the forelady . But they knew where she was going . The forelady , looking at no one , disappeared up the stairs . And , a few minutes afterwards , she came back . She opened the glass doors of her office . Everyone in the large room was waiting , pretending all the time they were n't . But nothing happened . Nothing ever happened . Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded , not one of the girls.  |p133In  their discussions of this , which they had endlessly that winter , walking at night up and down streets where the air challenged their failure with its expectant breath , in the tea rooms where they allowed themselves their weekly luxury , they puzzled out their failure . At the meeting of the Women 's Trade Union League , no one could understand why they failed . But no one blamed them . Bella blamed the Church , the state , the family : those things of which she refused to declare herself a part . Ellen pretended baffled anger . But she knew , although she never said , that she and Bella were not successful for the simple reason that they were not well liked . In their friendship there was room only for themselves . They were exclusive and excluding ; their friendship had a force no marriage could approach ; they spoke of the world only as something they would put their mark on . They 'd excluded Bella 's family , and Delia , who cried every Sunday when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion was the religion of humanity , her divinity the divine human soul . Delia would cross herself , pushing her children from the doorway so they would n't hear . " God forgive you , Ellen , " she would say . " God bring you back to the True Faith . It 's being friendly with that Jewish girl that did it . " Ellen would turn on Delia : " You belong back in the bog . This is America . We 're all equals here . If you say a word against my friend , I 'll never come to your house again . " That threat was too terrible for Delia . " You 're right , Ellen , " she said . " It 's America . We 're all alike . " But they were not all alike and there were times when she knew that she was more like Delia than like Bella . The home fear , the home silence : " Mind you , I 've said nothing , " you 'd hear them say at home . They wanted things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But then your tongue stuck to your mouth and would n't give out information , you spoke to placate , fob off , cause forgetfulness . To entertain . Bella could speak up at the Women 's Trade Union Lectures . Ellen could not . She thoughtp134that if she said the first word everyone would know her ignorance . She would be banished , her huge lacks would be seen . They would have no choice but to turn her away . She thought that if she kept silence she might be safe . Delia would come to Ellen 's room , touch the covers of the books as if they were dangerous or sacred objects , look at her old friend whom she had known from childhood , and from home , look at her with that wide gaze that understanding never touched , and say : " I ca n't get over it , El , coming where we come from , reading books like that . " She raged that Delia should speak out the thing she feared : that it was all ridiculous , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . She heard the home voices , buzzing at her : " You particularly , Ellen Costelloe , we in the church , among the swarm , know who you are . We know your father and your mother . We know you from your birth . You are no different from us . You are no better . " One of the favorite sayings in the town was this : " Two things never change : the mist , and the nature of man . " When she 'd heard them at home , in the churchyard , in the market , saying things like that , she 'd wanted to stand beside her father , saying to them : He and I are together , the same . Whatever he is it 's better than you ever thought of being . Her father did n't have thick , dead eyes like the rest of them , reflecting the belief that nothing could be done in the world , it was useless to begin to raise your hand . Their heavy feet trudged like those of the cattle they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next , the day of their death no different from any other , the last , only , in a series of identical dead days . Her parents had n't been like that and so the parish was relieved by their disasters , reveled in them as if their touching pleasure , liveliness , had brought as a matter of course illness , sin , madness , the betrayal of a daughter , and her leaving in the dead of night . When these thoughts came to Ellen , in her bed in America , she wanted to get up , go back , stand with her father , stand against the town . She 'd force the other woman out , then stand beside her father ,  |p135hel|p  him with the business , they would prosper , they would stand apart from the thick crowd of the townspeople , whose envy would rise up , steady and predictable as coins in the till , rising up like the incense at Benediction in Knock James Church . They 'd have their place , she and her father , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pride well earned , and justified . Not to be cast down . But how could there be pride in the mother , gibbering in her chair , in the darkness ? She could not be brought out to the light of day . The noise of her words that were n't words was low and repetitive and damning , like the swarm noise . It was the worst curse in the world : Forget your efforts . Nothing will prevail . The parish had been right about the bees . It had endured their swarming and had not been harmed . Action was danger , and the lie that there was nothing there needing their action had been their safety . Who had cleared the walls of all those clots , and spreading stains ? The honey that spilled down and that she knew could ruin the walls ? It had n't . Who had prevented ruin ? Secretly , at night ? The priest ? Old women ? Young , married ones leaving their babes at home at the priest 's whispered request ? They had prevailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lie and it had n't harmed them . Only she had been harmed . The sound of the bees swarming came into her dreams , telling her everything was useless . There was nothing to be done . It had prevented her , the sound of swarming and the lie that had not brought its rightful punishment , from speaking up about the books she read in the Trade Union League reading circle . It had caused her to fear the others , caused her to crawl , shamed as a child who vows to run away from home and turns back at the first sign of a stranger , back to Delia and Jimmy 's house for the old food , the soda bread , potato with butter and a drop of milk , the stirabout , the meat cooked black , the dense , muffling comfort of the sweets : rice pudding , trifle , custards , sago . Delia dishing out plate after plate . She came to them after the meetings where her silence was her shame and talked to Delia and Jimmy aboutp136the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meals she craved and gave her the false homage that she craved like the soft foods : " El , you 're a marvel . What you know . Imagine , Jim , from my own town . My best friend knowing that . " Did she go to Vincent for these things as well ? No . Yes . Yes and no . He said , like her , that you could do something in the world . The world could change . But she had never known if he believed it , or said it to keep her love . The memory of Vincent 's body comes back to her on her bed , known as she has no other thing : face , chair , ring , article of clothing . Better known than her own body , for she has looked freely at the whole of his as she has not looked at her own . Warned against her own flesh , she never caressed it as the loved object that Vincent 's had been . They would never tell you not to touch the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she had wanted to . From the beginning she had . It comes back to her now , his body , but gradually and not at once . The shoulders first , high spurs of bone , the lively tendons of the neck , the chest with its enchanting whorls of hair , flat , smooth , that she has followed with her lips , for she was never shy with him once she had given herself over . Her belonging came to her like language . This body , the words , the phrases she had known . Following the path of hair down to the narrow waist , the hips , the sex she did not fear , the satisfaction of its rising up with yearning for her , and the strong , protective legs , the feet , boyish , white , surprising for a man who worked as he did . The hands come to her next , then the arms . Hands that had traced and found her , smoothed and calmed and then aroused . Afterwards holding her face , kissing it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her nose , making her laugh with boyish kisses on her neck . Saying : " Imagine , you , my wife . " Wife . A simpler word than husband . Older , preferable . More intact . She was glad of being Vincent 's wife . Whatever else she might feel , she had never been wrong to be with him . How darkp137he 'd been when she had met him . Like an Arab prince , like an Italian , she had thought . She 'd loved the darkness of his hair against the white skin , surprising a man 's skin could be so white . The hiddenness of it , his whiteness , so that she 'd wanted to protect it . And as he grew older age spots appeared on the white expanse of his back . How ? She could never see them coming . Only knew that they were there . His hands , small for a workman , were covered by sparse , dark hairs . Vincent . She calls out to him now . He does n't answer . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that 's not right . She thought he never would . She had believed him . She had made him promise . He would never break a promise . Vincent . No answer . Where is Vincent ? Why does n't he hear her calling out for him ? Is he pretending not to hear , to punish her ? Because she knocked him down ? She knocked him down because she thought he was making advances towards her . He was reaching towards her skirt . She would n't let him . She would n't let him come to her in the state she was in . She knew what she was : a wreck , a horror . She must hide herself from him . She owed him , out of respect for what they once had been , that much . They had been beautiful , young . High-colored . They had talked , though not as well as she could talk with Bella . Vincent had n't the quickness of Bella 's mind , had n't read as much . But talk with them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words were , that twined around them , joining them , limb to interlocking limb . It was more truthful , what they said , because of that other knowing . And excitement , at the first , when she had talked at Delia and Jim 's table , about the reading circle . She watched how his eyes were fixed on her  --  riveted , he 'd later said  --  when she talked about the effects of the War and the sacred rights of every worker . As he looked at her she knew her power . She 'd smoothed her hair around her ears to draw attention to it.  |p138She  'd let her eye fall boldly on his , though he 'd not met it . She 'd got up , gone to the shelf for more sugar , though she had n't the need of it , so he could see her figure and her walk . And for the first time in her life she felt that stretching outward , stretching up , and felt him moving towards her steadily , inevitably , like a flame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , him saying nothing , or saying , " It 's just great , the thoughts you have . It 's a great education for me just to hear you speak . " And then , after some months of sitting , listening , he 'd invited her for a walk , and told her he was a great union man himself . It was the way of the future , unions , he said , it was a tide that could n't be turned back . He 's gone , to punish her . She knows she deserves it . Over all the years , she 'd done things to deserve his punishment . Not telling him about her mother . Lying , saying her parents both were dead . He 'd turned from her when she told him finally . " Why did n't you say anything ? Why did you lie all these years ? " She said nothing . She deserved this from him ; to raise her voice in her own defense would be to block justice . And to expose her mother and her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always wondered why you married me , " he said , refusing to look at her . " I knew I was n't up to you . Now I know you did it for this trick . " She told him she was afraid to go back home . Afraid of what the father would do to her . He did n't believe her . " Afraid ? You 've never been afraid of anything . You wanted to play me for a fool . " Afraid of nothing ? You , too , my husband never knew me . Almost always I have been afraid . You think because I stand up to employers , have a sharp tongue for poor souls who have n't got the wit to cut me back , because of this , you think I have no fear . I have always been afraid . No . Not always . No . Not before , when she was happy , well , when we would run , sing , make things in the kitchen , when my fatherp139would come home , embrace us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dancing with her , twirling me , my cheek against his jacket , I was not afraid then . No . Why would I be ? But afterwards , my mother , shamed and shameful , lying in her failures , in the mess , the family blood I had to find , my mother growing darker and the father turning from us ( you are turning from me : you will not be back ) , always after that I have been afraid . She 'd wanted to kneel before him , not in supplication , but to take his face in her hands so he would have to look at her . But she did n't . She turned her face to the wall ; she closed her eyes ; she accepted her punishment : that he would never understand . Now , lying on her bed , sixty years later , she remembers his face . She understands : he has been waiting all these years , pretending to forgive , to punish her for what she did . It 's why he is n't with her now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to punish her . She is alone , more alone than her mother ever was . She calls out . Strangers she has never seen approach . " Mother , " someone calls her , but this stiff face can not have been a child of hers . When the letter came from Anna Foley she 'd felt her life unraveling . Everything that she had : her house , her husband , children , safety in this new world , disintegrated . Alone in the house with her two babies , she sat at her table and wept . She ignored their cries until she could n't any longer ; absently she fed them , not seeing them for her tears . She put them in their rooms to sleep , not caring if it was time yet . She got into her own bed , shameful , in the middle of the afternoon , she 'd never in her life done such a thing , and hid in the darkness of the blankets . Over and over again she read the letter that Anna had sent ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read or write . She 'd had a nephew do it . Someone whose face Ellen did n't know had written to her , " You must come and get her now . I have a sickness , and it will get worse . I can not do for her like before . I 've said nothing top140your father . I 'll give you the chance . As promised . But act soon . " Before she 'd left , on the night the moon made the road white and the flat fields shone before her , Ellen had made Anna Foley promise : " If anything goes wrong with you , do n't go to my father . Get in touch with me . I 'll provide for her . She 's my charge . He 'll not have her to himself . " They shared a horror that he would have any charge of her . Him and that woman . They could imagine what the two of them might do . Leave her to grow into an animal , in her own filth . Ellen and Anna knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . But she had none of a baby 's loveliness . She had her heavinessinstead . Still , they honored what she had been . The other two would not . It had been in the back of her mind ; it was what she saved her money for , when other girls were sending it back home or spendingit on dresses . She was saving it , not knowing what could bedonewith the mother , but thinking she would buy a house for her , where they could live beside each other , and the mother could be sheltered , kept from view . After two years in the apartment in the Bronx , Vincent began to mention to her dreams of a small house , out in the country , raising her own food ( would Ellen feel up to it ? He 'd teach her ; it would not be hard ) . His wages were good , he was a machinist now , they could afford it . He saw greenness , animals , the warm eggs under the hens , the gardens he would dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he saw that , she saw a place to hide the mother , and in Vincent a man who would help her keep the mother from sight , who would take the mother in . She saw not the children 's health , not all the money saved on homegrownfood , but a place with an upstairs . A room with something for the mother to look out on where she could live her life in peace . Where she could die kept from the tearing hands of the deserting father , from the hard eyes of the woman in his bed . But now the time had arrived , and she knew she could n't do it . Lying in the dark , pulling the covers over her for protection ,  |p141she  saw her father 's face . The harsh eyes , the prosecuting mouth . She saw him gathering the strong boys , the muscled men in his employ . And around them , all the people in the parish , calling her thief , ringing around her , swarming in their accusations , liftingup stones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He waits for the police , who take her from the square , where all the town have assembled around her . Her father turns his back . He allows her to be taken away ; he tells them to show no mercy . But she does n't care ; it 's his eyes she fears , more than the policemen , more than the accusation of the parish , the eyes that turn from her , the back that stiffens itself against her , the arm that links up with the arm of that woman who shares his bed , their backs turned to her , disappearing down the road . She lay in her bed , weeping , shamed in front of Vincent . He should never see her in this shameful state . She had to tell him that she could n't do it , and he had to help her . She said she 'd never ask him for a thing again , not even a word between them . Only he had to do this thing . She wanted to cry out to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , throw herself against the hardness of his body , pull him by the hair , say to him : You have to understand me . This is why I could n't tell you . What if you said no before we married ? Then I could never have you , and I need you , you are the one thing in my life I can not be without . You never understand you are the stronger of us . You can live without me . Without you I have no life . In all my life , only you have not been a stranger . But she said nothing . She lay in her bed , covered herself , and wept . Her life was lost to her . All the years , plans , self-denial and renunciations , acts of courage . And now that it was the time she could n't go . The sight of her father 's eyes , his back turning against her , his sending her to prison while he went off with the other woman  --  none of this would she be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't speak to her for several days . He took the children away to stay with Delia . He came back into the house . He turned the light on in the bedroom.  | " I was thinking about things , " he said . " Suppose I could arrange it , then , to go there for you . Do it square . Talk to your father . Tell him we could pay him back the money you took from him . Say she 'd be better off here . He 'd have to see it . " She nodded , she barely had the strength for assent . His goodness overwhelmed her . She was overwhelmed with love . She could n't meet his eye . His goodness was like a natural thing , like rain , or clement weather , growth in the earth , shade when the sun was merciless . Vincent , can you love me as much as this ? So much ? Really as much as this ? " Thank you , " she said . " It would be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said another word to him before he went . She packed his bags . She did the necessary things . Bought the tickets from savings she had hidden from him for this purpose . The papers : the mother was old , she was infirm , but they would be responsible , they both were citizens , her husband had a steady-paying job . " A machinist . Very good , " the man said . Protestant . " A very steady job . " " Yes , " she said , her large heart beating , spreading like a stain , " there 'll be no problem sir . " " No , not with your husband and you vouching ; and she 'd not be taking away , like so many of them now , some citizen 's good job . " Laughed , she had to laugh now with him . " No , sir , I 'll see to her all myself . We 've a nice house in Queens . Sir , another time I 'll bring you some of our good eggs . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the papers from him , left in terror : he could change his mind . He never told her what he saw in the town she had left as a thief . He only came home , bringing her mother with him . She understood that , on the boat with her mother , he must have seen to her needs . She was n't filthy on arrival . Did he do everything , or did he pay someone , a stranger , a woman he 'd never seen ? Would her mother have let him wash her on the boat , or would she havep143kept her modesty ? She was ashamed that he might have had to do these things . But after all that , all that he 'd done , how could she have done what that stiff-faced one , her daughter , said she did ? She would n't knock him down . She 'd die for him . She 'd always been ready to do that . A shadow , spade-shaped , the width of a hand , falls on her brain and she remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never hurt him . After the son 's death , she turned from him , again . Because he kept her from her grief . And , she remembers now , she pushed him down , because he reached for her skirt , and she knew what he wanted , she could n't let him , she had to keep her body from him , in honor of what they had been . She did n't mean to push him down . Only away . She weeps now , for the things she never meant to do . Vincent , you must know the things I never meant . She thrashes in the ugly bed , as if she can wash it all into a blankness if she moves her head wildly enough . Why will the blankness not come now ? The blankness will not come . The sight comes back now , when she does n't want it . Where are you , lovely mother , your complexionpink , your hands transparent , and your clever feet ? I can not forgive you . Because you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them in the house . Her eyes were dead . Vincent said : " I think she 's happy here . She 's happy for this change . " Almost , sometimes , the mother looked as though she could be happy . Ellen let her hold the baby ; the mother almost let her dead eyes come alive . John was born while the mother lived among them . Was thatp144why she loved him best ? Did the presence of the mother bless his birth ? She felt the other two were born to be against her , by their births to thwart , balk , halt her progress , press her down . The first one , Magdalene , named foolishly , she thought , for Vincent 's mother , who had died in childbirth shortly after he left home . He blamed himself , she knew that , for he 'd helped her as the others in the family did not . " You were in Cork , Vincent , " she said , " for years before that ; she 'd grown unused to your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I could have helped . " So she allowed the daughter a foolish name , and it began a life of foolishness . She never could respect the child . All of her a softness . No resistance to the world . She felt she must resist against the softness of the child or else be swallowed up in it . Already she felt , in marriage , in motherhood , that which she most valued in herself beginning to be lost . She had no time to read or think . She grew ashamed when Bella visited , ashamed when she had to admit she 'd not read the last books Bella had left her , ashamed when she saw Bella slip the new books back into her bag , trying to be tactful , trying to keep Ellen from feeling shame . But she felt shame that her mind was being softened and pressed down in service to two babies . The second one knew her anger , and pulled herself back , stiffened herself , and made her body a refusal to be supplicant , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . She turned away . Ellen was jealous of Vincent , popular and successful in his job . Jealousy and pride . The two strands : Why him and not me ? But with the mother in the upstairs room , she felt herself becalmed : a small boat moored in shallow water . She gave herself up to it . It pleased her to have given birth to a male child . She felt that she did not have to resist this one . She allowed the days to wash over her . She did n't try to read . She lost track even of the newspaper , until Vincent chided her . " You must keep up , " he told her , " it 's a great world out there , a great day for thep145workingman . You have to keep up . " At night he wanted to talk about it : the new world he saw growing outside the house . Once , in front of Bella , he said , " It 's time men knew there are some women have twice the brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " He said that to honor her , in front of Bella . She was spooning out tapioca . She banged down the spoon in rage . Furiously , she shook a spoon of tapioca under her husband 's nose . " That 's the brains of me , and not an inch above it . " His praise mocked her , she felt , before her friend . Bella and Vincent looked away , pretending to see nothing . Did Vincent like talking to Bella ? Or was he too afraid ? He never did relax with her , but he admired her . " She 's a person you can learn from , " he 'd said . And she listened to him talk about the union , about the Democratic party . Sometimes when they talked , Ellen would feel her eyes grow heavy , would realize that she had fallen asleep a moment , because she was so tired from the children , from the mother , she could n't follow their ideas . Sixty years later , the events of what has been her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mist . The mist clears in patches ; the water becomes visible , and then from the leaden band of water rise up mountains : events in her life . Then the mist falls once again , and nothing is distinguished . She is lost . She can hear sounds through the mist , like conversations in fog . The voices fade and even her fear fades : she gives over to the undifferentiated blur , it 's better that way . It will lift , or it will not . The mountains , the islands , will show themselves ' or will submerge forever . She is quiet and no longer angry . It is summer evening and the sun , late in descending , vanishes . The birds are silent . In the heavy darkness nothing more will come to pass . But where is Vincent ? The moments when she is free of fear have gone . He has left her among strangers . All her life , she knew she would live out this moment . It always came to her , this fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The night she made him promise , she was lying awake , feeling her sleepless , lively skull , she saw herself alone like this , in fog , and among strangers . The sound of swarming came to her , a young woman , alone with her new husband in a bed in the first light of the morning of a sleepless night . She could n't stand the mocking voices she could n't shut out . She heard the swarm , the voices once again , but now in fog , she called out to him , knowing he was happy in his sleep . She said his name to wake him . She wanted him to give up his happiness . She dug her nails into his palms . " Swear you 'll let me die in my own bed . Not among strangers . " He has tricked her . She brings her lips together and forms the curses she heard from the drunken men in her father 's pub , from the sailors or the seasick men on the boat coming over , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curses and the filth rise up . She opens her mouth to release them . The stiff face comes towards her . " Calm down , Mother . " The stiff face says prayers . Now she will curse the prayers , brought to this place from hatred . " Banish this evil spirit , " the stiff face says . " Get her away from me . Send her back home to hell . " " All right , Theresa . I 'll take over now . " Bella . " Religion is the opiate of the masses . " Bella will send the lying stiff face from her , back to her home in hell . " Gran . It 's all right , Gran . I 'm with you . I wo n't leave . " A man 's voice . She remembers now . It 's Daniel . She can tell him . She can ask where Vincent is . He will tell her the truth . " Where 's your granddad gone to ? " " He 's been sick . He 's coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Granddad 's coming home . " His hand is warm and full of health . She remembers this hand , and the other one , the girl 's hand . These were the children who made her want to go on with her life . She ca n't remember why . Only that they were interesting to her . She could watch theirp147minds absorb the world . Knowing . Watching them take in the world made her willing again to be alive . Those children , Dan and Cam . She had told them they must go into the world . She had allowed them to do it , she had made it easy for them . And they had done it , and come back to her , with the world in their hands , laying it before her , so it could be hers as it was theirs . So she could , again , wish to live her life . Vincent . Forgive me . I was proud of you . " The union , " she shouts out . " The union , Gran ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She can see Daniel 's face , knows that she can say something that he will understand . " Brave , " she says . Now the mist comes up , exposing one patch of the river , one island becomes visible . The decade of the 1920s , once a blur to her , her young motherhood vague , a watery existence she can never settle on . But she remembers the excitement of the years when Vincent , risking everything , worked to build a union , when they could have killed him for it . He told her that , " I could be killed for it , they could kill me , they 'd be glad to do it if they could , " and she was proud of him , " but let them try . " " The hell with them , then , Vincent . No sense living if you ca n't stand up and say who you are . " She could n't remember what the issues were or why the bosses fought them . But she could bring back the feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes played on the company spies , " beakies " they were called . Tuesday substituted in the code for Monday . " We know they 're listening in , " Vincent would say , " so we say on the phone , We 'll have a meeting on the Tuesday . By the way , ' we 'd say then , I 'd a letter from the family at home , they 're extending the cowhouse on the west side of the farm to accommodate twenty-three new head of cattle ' ; that means , you see , El , this is great now , that we 're meeting at the place we all know about on Twenty-third Street , on the Mon/day night . " Excited as a boy and boyish in his ardor , he would come to her at night , home from a late meeting , now older , heavier in his body , and his rough cheek , cold from the outside , would arouse her . In the mornings he would talk at the breakfast table to the children about starving workers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanzetti , the tragedy of it , Al Smith , he 's Irish , children , but he might yet be the President , about how the Pope himself would sooner or later endorse labor unions , he knew it on good authority , they need n't fear what the priests said . She 'd get angry then : " What do you care a damn for the priest 's word , there 's not a one of them who 's not a liar or a thief . Or a pansy on the top of it . " She 'd never go into a church . Vincent would take the children . The parish priests would try talking to her , series of them coming to the house over the years . Now , Mrs. MacNamara , do n't you think . Some pretending they had just stopped by . One , threatening her with hellfire , in her kitchen , told her of her melting bones to come , her crackling flesh , eternal separation from the ones she loved . " What kind of God is it that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to him . " The same God you say separates babies from their mothers if they die before a splash of water hits their heads . " The face of Bella clear before her eyes . I believe in the religion of mankind . " You 're nothing but a Red , " the priest said , with his heavy accent . " No better than the satanic Communists of Russia . " She thought of Bella 's family . " I 'll be asking you to leave , then , Father . I did n't cross the ocean so I could be insulted in my own home . " Arguing with Vincent against religion . " You 're a union man . They 've threatened every Irishman who has a union card with eternal damnation . They 've held the labor unions back for fifty years . Turning the radio up so he would have to hear the voice of Father Coughlin . " This is the mouthpiece of the church you wantp149your children brought up bending the knee to . Filth . Poison . And you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not close my mind or bend the knee . The children , though , were pious . Seeing of course their father , who was kinder than she , who never shouted , did not turn away , had not the tongue that mocked . They thought , perhaps , his kindness was from God , that perhaps God would keep them from her anger . Even John : " I 'm going to be an altar boy . You would n't stop me , Mom . " " No . " " You 'll help me with my Latin . " " I 'll help you learn anything . " " But you wo n't come see me serve the Mass ? " " I 'll not set foot inside a church . " He did n't say " Even for me ? " As Magdalene would have . Theresawould not , she 'd have made her mother feel she was missing something , and was glad she was able to keep her mother from a thing of value . Her prayer a thorn to pierce her mother 's flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , a tree beside her . Honor , shelter , and a place of pride . Her son . Intact , he seemed to her . And safe . The only one of them not frightened by her mother . Although Ellen understood why she could appear frightening . A woman with hair growing on her face . A beard . Like a goat . A man . " Does Grandma have a beard ? Why , Mom ? Is Grandma a man ? " " Your grandma loves you . You must love her back . " John sitting on the floor as she cooked . Knowing her need of his company but saying nothing . The girls refused to look at their grandmother . Magdalene : Do n't make me , Mama . Theresa : I will not . Then Vincent getting sick . How scared the children were , andp150her anger at the children for the fear they wore so he could see it on their faces . " You 're no good to your father with those faces . " But she was angry at Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctor said a heart attack . " At his age , Mrs. MacNamara , barely forty , he will have to find another job , an easier one , and the union work is too much for him . " Shop stewardhe was , and meeting every night . " Tell him the decision is his , the doctor said . Stop it or die . " She was angry at her husband 's white , sick face . She wanted to scream at him : " How could you do this to me ? " He knew that her voice lied when she was so sympathetic , that she made her body lie . He cried when they told him he had to quit the subways . He turned his face to the wall so she could not see the tears on his face . " A change will be good , I guess . Everyone needs a change . " The strike happened while he was in the hospital . It hurt her to see the others come and tell about it . She was dying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd missed it she would miss it too . She saw him drift away when they talked about it , the pain of it sickening him once again . She was angry with them for going on with it , angry at them for having had the strike without him . She wanted to scream at them that they were selfish , disloyal , they should have waited for him , all the thousands of them , she did n't care ; it was unjust that it should happen while he lay in hospital . She wished ill to the union . She was furious when they offered her a job in one of the change booths after he 'd used up all his sick pay . " We were thinking , since you 've this great interest in the union , you could become a member . Sort of take his place . " " Thank you , I 've found another situation , " she said , clenching her fists so as not to strike out at them . As if she 'd be a part of something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch him on the shore , separate , ill , ashamed of the failure of his body , as if he 'd failed her as a man . Bella got her a job in Ratner 's millinery . Once again with sillyp151girls she had no patience with . But her fingers were dull now ; she did n't like the work , the heavy materials : wool , felt , pushing the needle through : no fineness to it , skill was nothing . Bella talked her into joining the union . She could n't refuse , but she 'd not go to any meetings , though the talk of them excited her , and she pressed Bella for every detail of what was said . But she 'd not do that to Vincent . He never knew she had a union card . She was happy to quit the job after a year ; it made her feel old , out of the swim of the young girls . She quit when Vincent took the job with Patent Scaffolding . She did n't understand his work . Making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . He 'd make up models , like a child 's toys , she thought , she did n't respect the work as she did when she believed he made the subways run . And working for a company that did n't have a union . " How could there be a union , El , there 's only five of us in the whole operation . " He knew she 'd lost her pride in him . With this new work , he was n't a man Bella could understand her pride in being married to . Though Bella was kind , said he 'd done the right thing , Ellen knew that Vincent 's step down from union work meant he had lost his footing in Bella 's life . It was never the same between them . And then , when John died , Bella , too , told her not to grieve . She closed her heart to her then . You have not understood that I havelost my life . Why was he taken from her ? Of them all the most beautiful , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours with him spent fighting about a whore ? The girl he 'd got with child . " The foolishness , the filth , " she 'd said . " Why were you with a girl like that ? " Like her own father , foolishness with a woman . When she thinks about the ways of men , she tries to get outp152of the bed , but she is strapped , she tries to tear herself free . I will not submit to the ways of men . She remembers why she struck Vincent . The ways of men do damage in the world . And her own son . Like that as well . Like her father . With that foolish girl . Who sat , smoking her cigarette , painting her nails , crying into her bunched-up tissues . Her perfume so cheap it made the house stink of sex . And nothing in her mind but what 's between a man 's legs and her own and how to make the most of the whole foolish business . Unable to keep herself pure for memory of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her word meant nothing . I was right to take the child from her . He meant nothing to her , I knew it all along . That is why I did it . Her grief , her memory were nothing to my own . She recalls her towering grief . The telegram . " Your son , an honor to his country . " Her mind , she could see her mind , a door blown off a house in a wild storm . I have lost my mind . She felt herself become an animal . From pain she threw herself against one wall and then another , pulled the pins out of her hair and then her hair out of her head , scratched at her flesh , happy to draw blood . I will not live my life . I will no longer be in my life . The grief that towered , cut off sight . My son is no longer in the world . I will not , either , live . My lungs will stop , I will not allow them to draw breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush it . For the best . I hate this life . The buzzing noise inside her head . Mocking . Like the electric noise at the power station Vincent took her to . The lights that flashed in darkness . To stop the buzzing she banged her fists against her head ,  |p153her  head against the floor , on the hard table . Vincent tried to stop her . " Stop , Ellen , stop , you 'll kill yourself , you 'll hate yourself for throwing yourself around like this . " " I want to . " " I wo n't let you . You have other children to think about . " She spat in his face then . " Let me go . " " I wo n't . I 'll hold you . I will never let you go . " She scratched at him . He held her tighter ; he was stronger than she . " I wo n't let go of you so you damage yourself . Stop it , Ellen , you have to stop this in yourself . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The wild nature of her grief . Because of this grief that towered , because they said she must stay alive , she had to take the child . Daniel . She knew his mother never really loved him . She never even loved his father . She was incapable of love . And now , lying in bed , holding the boy 's hand , Daniel , whom she took from his mother , she hears the buzzing come again . You had no right . You stole the child from his mother . She cries out , " I had the right . Her grief was nothing next to mine . She was nothing . Bad from the start . Look what became of her . I kept him from all that . " The buzzing says : You made her be that way . NO , she always was . And Daniel never minded . Listen , he 'll tell you . He always told me when I asked him . But I never asked him . But he would have said . He was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . I know it : he was happy . " Dan , " she calls out . He comes to her . He holds her hand . She confronts the buzzing . I 'll ask him now . " I 'm with you , Gran , " he says , holding her hand , a claw , with his live , healthy hand.  |p154He  puts the bars of the bed down . He lays his head against her chest as if he wants to listen to her heart . " Rest now , Gran . " She pats his head . She can sleep now , she understands that he has always needed to be hers . Even now he needs her comfort . Everything is over . But he is here with her . Vincent will not be back . But she can sleep . And she is falling into sleep , and dreaming now , of all the things for which she can not be forgiven.  | I T ' S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME , " THERESA SAYS . " I THINKwe should start packing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't notice and we can keep on top of it , not have some huge mess all at once . " " We 're not going to do that , Theresa , " Cam says . " It 's their house . He 's coming back today . He 'll be here living in it . " " It 's ridiculous , him rattling around this house like that . " Marilyn and Dan listen to them , standing in the doorway of Ellen 's room . They watch everyone fall into place : Cam and Theresafixed at the center , the antagonists ; Sheilah in back of her mother urging injury ; Ray and his son , John , outside the circle , knowing no act of theirs can have weight . Marilyn hangs behind Dan a little , waiting for him to walk between the two antagonists , to fool them , to distract them , sing , tell a joke , make a remark on the weather , anything to make them stop . " I thought we were going for a walk , " Dan says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and bangs the screen door . He can see the line of it , starting with Ellen , hating herself , refusing to love her daughters , stealing him from his mother ,  |p158taking  Cam from Magdalene ; he sees John and Sheilah in their mother 's blackened house . And he and Marilyn , always a little desperate : We 'll fix it , wait a minute , we 'll do something ; it will be all right . He knows he has to make something move in Cam , Cam 's anger is like a foreign power that can colonize their lives . When she 's angry ( she is never angry at him ) , the look of the world changes for him , as if a war had happened . The peaceful streets where you could live a modest , public life have been demolished ; where there were cafes , churches , simple houses there is rubble : you sit on the bombed-out site searching in the wreck for the familiar things . " Look around at all this , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's changed . " He knows that , even angry , she can be interested in the world . " I mind , " he says . " You would n't think I 'd mind , considering we were n't happy here . You 'd think I 'd like it all wiped out . " He knows she has begun to listen , but he has n't got her yet . The engine of her anger still runs , he can hear it ; it slows down but does n't stop . She knows he 's trying to distract her ; she can feel his effort . " I guess that 's the oldest story in the book , right , talking about the neighborhood going downhill ? They probably said it in the Stone Age  --  Look at those assholes , iron '  --  and in the Middle Ages , Who wants those goddamn spices from the East ? ' " She pities him . She sees him floundering , desperately trying to be interesting , to make her laugh so that she 'll give it up , this anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up , that she enjoys hoarding , fingering . Its sharpness creates borders she can understand : a skeleton , a frame . Pleasant to feel that bone , that wood , like lying down and feeling the jutting pelvis , like touching rafters , beams , before the ornamental camouflage is once and for all in place . She can know who she is in the world if she is somebody 's antagonist ; to be Theresa 's enemy , therefore not Theresa in the world , satisfies her , gives her certainty and hope.  |p159But  Dan is drowning in his efforts to make her stop ; what gives her certainty and hope brings him anxiety and displacement . She wo n't do that to him . She 'll give it up for him , this anger , desirable to her , valuable as medicine or wealth . " Do you remember that magazine with house plans in it ? " she says . He remembers it ; it was a magazine Vincent brought home for them , made up of photographs of houses with blueprints of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , looking for something . What ? The book itself enchanted them . They loved the shiny pages , heavier than those of ordinary magazines , the photographs of new-built houses among trees that in themselves looked modern , unencumbered trees , trees without sad histories , trees that would give the right amount of shade , but would n't , for a moment , cut off from the wonderful and lucky family who lived among them even an inch of light . The man outside the house , the father , wore a plaid shirt , smoked a pipe ; the mother wore a Fair Isle sweater . He forgets the children , their faces , what they wore . The children , boy and girl , were not important : it was those young parents . Those young parents who had nothing at all to do with Europe . He and Cam got the magazinein 1949 . He remembers : she was eight and he was six . Europe seemed to him still covered over by a cloud of danger and shame , the War , the ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ireland , which Ellen called a bog , a backwater , a filthy hole . She mocked the rich first-generation greenhorns who took their families back home . To see what ? she would say . The cattle shitting in the streets , right up to your door , the children with their teeth rotted out of their heads , the beautiful thatched cottages swept only once a year , the tinkers carrying their filthy babies in their filthy blankets ? Oh , this beautiful thing , Ellen would say , through furious cruel teeth , we loved it so , that 's why we could n't wait to leave . And when his grandfather would send into the air a nice memory , rising like a balloon to give them pleasure , when he would say : The greenness of the grass , thep160goodness of the milk , the lovely bread , the songs , the smell of the peat fire , she would raise the hammer of her scorn . She would begin to talk in a false brogue . " Yes , Dad , " she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . You left at fifteen and lucky for you . ' T was a lovely life you had . Breaking your back on the farm that went all to your brother , then apprenticed out at twelve . ' T was what ye wanted for yer children , was n't it . The lovely bread , the lovely singsongs by the peat fire . Everybody slaving till they died or wore out . ' T was wonderful . If only I could have it back , my carefree youth . " And she would flap and dance and invent a song . " My carefree youth / The cowshit and the toothless mother / And the starving tinkers out to steal me blind / Back , back to the auld sod of my dreams . " Dan would see his grandfather pretend to laugh , or genuinely laugh , for Ellen could do that , she could make her husband laugh , and when her wit was cruel and meant to draw fresh blood he would go quiet . She could see that she had hurt him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Europe : the War , the Ireland he could not make a clear picture of . Was it the green country of his grandfather , or the hard , filthy place that she spoke of ? He 'd traveled to France and Italy , to Spain with Sharon , long before he went to Ireland . He 'd gone only two years ago , with Cam and with the girls . Cam and Darci loved it . But for him , the country was a sign : they could never be happy , any of them , coming from people like the Irish . Unhappiness was bred into the bone , a message in the blood , a code of weakness . The sickle-cell anemia of the Irish : they had to thwart joy in their lives . You saw it everywhere in Irish history ; they would n't allow themselves to prosper . They did n't believe in prosperity . Perhaps , he thought , they were right not to . He saw it everywhere he went in Ireland , the proof of the Irish temperament , the doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could see it in their politics , their architecture , in the layout of their living rooms , their towns . Hep161compared the way the Irish lived with what he 'd seen in France and Italy . In Ireland , there were no glimpses of shocking , reassuringbrightness : a plate with overlarge , loud-colored flowers , a milk jug in the shape of a bird 's head , a rectangular pillow in a dark , primary shade , a fountain , just for nothing , in the center of a town , the trees extravagantly leaved , the chestnut , and the willow . It was fine for Cam and Darci to bend over laughing at the decor of their Bed and Breakfasts , but for him it was a dreadful talisman . It seemed that in every dining room of every B &; B in Ireland , even in those that took in only three or four paying guests , there was an inexplicable presence : a tableau of animals that appeared from a distance to be the work of a skilled taxidermist , but upon a closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunities to get a closer look ) turned out to be plastic animals frozen in deadly attitudes , about to swoop or perch or use their talons , beneath a sheet of Plexiglas . He understood the Irish . They were a colonized nation and had taken from their colonizers all their symbols of prosperity and of success . The English gave them their model , and like the colonized everywhere , they learned their lesson only halfway : they learned the wrong half . They copied from the English the jarring printed carpets and the half-glass doors that closed as if they kept out someone dangerous or insane . And , fearful of their reputation as slatterns ( fatal to the tourist industry ) , they put dust-resistant coverson their furniture , and on their mattresses quickly drying nylon sheets . They seemed , Dan thought , to have been taken up by an obsession with concealment , or protection , by impermeable plastic . On the graves were arrangements of plastic flowers , in what looked like plastic cake dishes , the kind churchgoing women would use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish tea . He watched the furious , the desperate , the anxietyfilledcleaning of the Irish women who had taken paying guests . He saw that there was nothing natural about their cleaning , nothinglearned in childhood , practiced over the years . The cruel , expensive vacuum cleaners ( Just doing a bit of Hoovering , so ) setp162the rhythm of the day for these genuinely nice women and their families . A few hours of frantic activities : the breakfasts , the cleaningup . Then the long day of waiting , like unsure lovers , for the rented car , with its Americans , its Germans , for someone to come out and say , " How much ? " The tourists did n't say , as they should have , " How much for the family beds ? " For Dan had seen how they had done it  --  the Americans , the Germans , the English , by their holidaying  --  turned the children from their beds . He 'd awakenedin the night and found the children sleeping in their sleeping bags on the sitting-room floor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often facsimiles of peat in neon-colored plastic . How nice they were , how friendly , these children and their mothers . The fathers you never saw : they drove away quite early in the mornings , or they were outside with the cows all day ; they came back for a silent dinner ; they went back out then to the pub . Sometimes if you were at the same pub as one of these men in the evenings he would smile , embarrassed , for he knew and you knew : his wife was making money off your need for shelter and a bed . The towns displayed their own kind of blindness , not mistaken and mislearned , like the distressing ugliness of the private houses , but a willed , blunt disregard for beauty , a blank , punitive , **27;16941;TOOLONG , a reproach to ornament , to prideful style . The towns were built for commerce , and stripped down for it . They had been market towns once , cattle had been brought from the surrounding areas into the large central square . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses , the thin sills painted dull blue or prisongreen . Some curse of money-changing , money-making , had come down upon these towns . They stood for commerce , but with none of its excitement : no goods flashing , bright stuff disappearing , then appearing once again . No , what Dan could see was that this was the idea of " the town " thought up by people whose genius was rural . Real life was in the countryside . And the country was miraculous.  |p163So  they had both been right , his grandmother , his grandfather . Ellen , brought up in town , had seen the bleak , commercial greed ; his grandfather had seen the land 's beauty . Dan had wanted to see what they both had seen . So they had driven south to Cork and found Vincent 's village , Dromnia , lush and gentle , a female landscape full of hidden brooks and noble trees . And they had gone north , to the west of Clare , and had found Tulla , Ellen 's town . A steep-streeted town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd all been poured from the same batch of concrete , all at once . They 'd found her father 's pub . Darci and Cam , who loved pub life ( Darci was , to her great joy , served her first drink in Tulla , a shandy , beer and lemonade ) , were adopted lovingly by Ellen 's town . " Can you imagine , this one is the granddaughter of Ellen Costelloe . " No one remembered Ellen ; they could n't have ; no one they met was old enough ; they pretended that they did . It was a kind pretense ; Dan did n't mind . But in the stones of the streets , in the blank cement faces of the houses , Dan felt the child Ellen 's misery , imagined her a little girl living above the pub noise , the men 's sickness , the dark small rooms . For he could feel it when he walked into the rooms she knew . He saw the countryside around the town , brief fertile patches , taken over soon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tourists cursed it . He understood . He could n't sing and joke like Cam and Darci ; he was happy to take Staci home to the room , to read while she made perfect sketches of the hillsides and the furniture and wrote brief , numerous , and uninforming letters to her friends back home . He felt they were his people , the Irish , and he pitied and admired them . He enjoyed them , but he felt that , like him , they had no idea how to live . He takes Cam 's arm as they walk down their childhood street . They look across the street ; their eyes fall on the same sight ; they are thinking the same thing . Some children , young teenagers theyp164must be , thirteen at most , are getting on the bus for Jamaica . Cam and Dan know from the way they 're dressed ( uneasily ) and standing ( tentatively , as if they are afraid someone will come along and tell them they have no right to be there ) that these children will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . The City . They travel only from borough to borough but it is as if they travel to another continent . They are leaving home . Dan says : " Remember when you took me into the museum . It was so exciting . I felt like you were taking me in a covered wagon . Cam is n't listening . They are about to pass by 163 Linwood Avenue , where Cam lives with her mother and Bob . Cam 's eye is on Magdalene 's window , facing out onto the street . Dan sees Cam 's mouth go tense . He knows she wo n't suggest that they go in . It occurs to him that in all his life he has n't been in that house more than twenty times . That house . It was a place that you got out of , quickly , into the fresh air , to the city , or to Vincent and Ellen 's , or away somewhere in your car . Cam never wanted him in that house ; he never particularly wanted to be there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Magdaleneruled there , making Cam behave her worst . Cam sees that the drapes of her mother 's room are drawn . It makes her furious ; she 'd like to bang open the doors of the house , run up the stairs , open the curtains , and say , " Mother , it 's the middle of the day . How about letting the sunshine in . " She knows it 's a bad sign , the drawn curtains . She wonders how much time she has before she 'll have to go into the house and find out , once and for all , whether Magdalene will do it . Whether she 'll walk out of her room , onto the street , back to her parents ' house . To be there for her father . Cam expects the worst . She does n't want to think about it now . She takes Dan 's arm and steers him forcefully around the corner , as if he were a stranger , as if he did n't know where they were.  |p165BEHIND  THE DRAWN CURTAINS IN MAGDALENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as she always does , expectantly , flirtatiously . " Hil000 , " she says , drawing out the last syllable . It is Kevin Browning , her partner in Maison Magdalene . " Oh , darling , I 'm so glad you called , " she says . " I 've been trying to get dressed and I just do n't think I can make it . I have these terrible spots in front of my eyes . " " Sweet , you 've got to go . What will you wear ? Let 's plan what you 'll wear . " She ca n't listen to what usually enthralls her : this description of the contents of her closet , which he analyzes and embellishes with his devoted eye . " The teal shirt with the green stretch slacks ? " he says . " The purple pants with the white blouson top ? " She is n't listening . He has betrayed her . He has left her .

Then she began to resent everyone who had allowed her to be brave . She saw the way they swallowed her stories as evidence of their brutality . They believed she was all right because they did n't care if she was not . She retreated to her bedroom . She had expended her reserve . The energy that she had used for the eighteen years of her widowhood to cut a figure of public bravery was used up . She 'd had no notion of herself apart from the responses that she could engender . Her parents ' early disappointment in her left her hungry , as if she 'd been permanently underfed . Her nourish/ment came from the eyes of strangers , it had to . The only other choice left her was to take the grudged minimum , whatever the parents had left . But she had only to walk onto the street to know that her parents were wrong . She could tell that her physical presence was a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks , but not only that , it was the conviction that came over her after the first glance fell on her that she existed with a wholeness that was perfect and almost abstract . The wholeness of a geometric shape . She existed in the minds of those who looked at her with the solidity of a mathematical idea . She felt herself grow more durable every moment she walked in the world . Soon she could feel herself impermeable . Nothing chipped or marred the surface of the self they made for her , those who looked . She did n't have to give them anything . It was perfect ; it was what she liked . Even in middle age she could command the look that made her , to herself , substantial . It was given to her by her clients , by the men who took her to expensive restaurants and told her she ate like a bird , she needed someone to take care of her ; they gladly would if she would only say the word .

In June of 1963 , at the height of bouffant , beehive , those exhausting , challenging architectural days in the world of beauty parlors , Kevin Browning walked into Maison Magdalene with his diploma from the Robert Valli School of Beauty . He was hoping to be able to find a job in his hometown . His first choice was Maison Magdalene , because he had known Cam in school . Awed , like everyone else , by her public achievements , he would never have talked to her , but her connection with Maison Magdalenegave it the suggestion of solidity he craved.  |p167Kevin  was one of those inexplicable flowerings that grow up in a household marked by nothing but drabness and a numbed attention to the plain details of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised five children with the withdrawn , unoriginal stoicism of a financially pressed woman whose dreams are of " sets " of furniture  --  a bedroom " set , " a living-room " set "  --  that she will never have .

Smooth nails , untouched , unused to dishwater , not cracked and striated like his mother 's . The dream mother would walk , high-heeled , through light rooms smelling wonderfully of perfume . She would take him on vacations , to the movies . She would take him out to lunch . Inside her heart would be a suffering maiden she would hide with jokes that everybody loved . She would see how he stood out among his family . For , although his dream mother was not his mother , he peopled his dream family with siblings from the life . " A rose among thorns , " she would call him . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Kevin walked through the door of Maison Magdalene , he experienced a searing moment when the dreamer sees , shockingly embodied , the figure of his dream . Magdalene smiled , turned , shook a can of hairspray , joked as she sprayed the tower of hair she 'd crafted for a customer , then swiveled the customer in her chair so she could see the effect of the back of her now perfect coiffure . He said , " I 'm Kevin Browning , I 'm a hairdresser , and I 'm looking for a job . " She answered , " Dream on , Macduff . " He was n't daunted . " Well , at least you could talk to me . You could give me a cup of coffee , for God 's sakes , " he said . Of course she hired him . They soon found in one another natures generous but enclosed , imaginative yet easily discouraged by the world of fact which they both hated and revered ; ambitious , concerned with fashion , interested in money , pious , sentimental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own acts.  |p168Kevin  's presence changed the tone of Maison Magdalene in ways that were alarming or invigorating , depending upon who spoke . It was said at the same time " He 's ruined everything , " and " He 's a real breath of fresh air . " He and Magdalene spent all their time together , endlessly turning the pages of magazines , not idly , speculatively , but as professionals who needed to find the precise objects that could make their vision real . What they had in mind was a blending of the most desirable of Magdalene 's old clients with the new young faces Kevin could bring in . There was a middle range of women who came to the shop three or four times a year , seen to by Betty or by Myrna , whom Magdalene and Kevin thought of as so much underbrush , more profitably cleared away . In a while , their attitude towards Betty and Myrna 's clients extended to Betty and Myrna themselves . Sensing rightly the danger to their positions , Betty and Myrna took exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formal . Resolutely , Magdalene had discouraged their confidences . If she saw them approach her with a need to unburden themselves , she became jokey , hyper-urban : an Irish tough . She lifted up one shoulder ; she looked in the mirrors that were everywhereto check her lipstick . She shot at the sufferer , from halfway out of the room , some bracing platitude . And then she was gone : her high heels tapping , beating out the truth : How futile is selfpity . How relentless is the world . When Betty and Myrna tried to speak to Magdalene about their worries , they never got her ear . She was always off somewhere , to lunch with Kevin , or to church , a decorator or a salesman was soon coming and she must look over the samples which she had n't had a God 's blessed minute even to think about . " You know how my brain is , like a rag picker 's bag , my mother used to say . " Then she was flipping through brochures ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available to them . They were out of her world , and soon they quit working for her . With the advice of decorators , salesmen who could supply , at the crack of a whip , a dreamy array of new products , Maisonp169Magdalene transformed itself between May 30 and August 15 , 1964 ( Feast of the Assumption , chosen by Magdalene for luck ) , into Maggi 's . Young women in short skirts began appearing so that Kevin would cut their hair into geometric shapes . At the same time , Magdalene kept her older customers , and got some new ones : doctors ' wives , the wives of one judge and a local politician , women in their forties frightened that perhaps they had lost their lives . Kevin learned the new boyish haircuts thought up in London and Liverpool . Magdalene continued to arrange the hair of her old customers in homage to the widowed Mrs. Kennedy . Maggi 's was the home of two friendly but unrelated tribes , who watched each other with amusement and regard , occasionally communicating by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the tribespeople returned to their separate tents to sleep , the two priests , Kevin , Magdalene , met and came together . Cam was in law school ; Kevin lived at home and saw each meal he took there as the death of all he loved , so every night he and Magdalene ate out , or bought food for the one meal they would prepare and eat , not at the kitchen table , but on lacquered Chinese trays Kevin had bought for just this purpose , trays they would place on their laps as they sat in front of the TV . When she came home for weekends , Cam felt she 'd walked into a strange house , presided over now by strangers . She saw how the house she 'd grown up in had changed . Kevin and her mother spent their weekends in Suffolk County buying antiques . Magdalene had bought all the furniture in the house in 1952 , when she shocked everyone by moving out of the apartment she had lived in as a bride , then an envied mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then feared . She was tired , she said , of throwing rent money down the sink . She was tired of the smell of meat that came up from the butcher shop , though for fourteen years she had n't said a word about it , and had n't seemed to notice that there was a smell . She bought one of her customers ' houses when the customer 's husband died . She furnished the house perfunctorily , as if it interested her as an investment rather than ap170dwelling . But with Kevin , she became acquisitive . Large , dark pieces of mahogany , plush couches took over the spaces occupied by insubstantial , tired Danish modern she had bought on the installment plan from Montgomery Ward . Gilt mirrors sprouted everywhere like spores , Cam thought , and heavy damask curtains kept out every possibility of light . Only Cam 's room remained untouched , its maple single bed with plaid spread and matching curtains a kind of shrine , to an unknowing , under-ripe virginity . It was a mixed homage they paid the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Leaving it so , they must have seen how it would comment on and mark the others . When she took Dan around the house , Cam said her room looked like the madame 's daughter 's . They both laughed but Dan understood Cam 's sense of defilement , of the desecration of the dwelling that had been her address if not her real home . Dan and Cam were right in understanding that the decorating scheme had everything to do with sex , but the connection was n't simple . What they could n't know was that Magdalene and Kevin worshipped the accoutrements that were supposed to lead to sex , but found the act itself abhorrent . High on their list of valued attributes was elegance ; they were , in addition , both possessed of an extreme bodily consciousness . The act of sex required that they give up both ; they both preferred , therefore , to avoid it . And for Kevin to think seriously about the act of sex would require that he acknowledge that the lovely perfumed women who peopled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his own . It was the body of a man that he desired when desire did intrude . The idea of that in himself disgusted him . He could only endure himself if he pushed from his mind those pictures that grew of themselves ( he tried to stop them ) in such lush and frightening profusion , like , he thought when he made his Act of Contrition , a jungle growth . So together Magdalene and Kevin created a place which was meant to do homage to sex by replacing the act of sex with its effects and its surroundings . And in the center of it all they keptp171Cam 's room , their thoughts , their stories about Cam herself . When Cam came home , Kevin was prepared to worship . But she would n't let him . He was ready for a cool and unmoved goddess . He was n't prepared for the clear , freezing glance that fell on his every act and killed his spirit . Cam knew that what she did to Kevin was terrible ; she knew it and she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done a single act for which to blame him . But he had done the one thing she could not forgive . He had become to her mother the child she had always wanted . Cam heard their confiding , easy conversations . Her mother saying : " What 's up , love ? You under the weather ? " And Kevin saying , " I 'm depressed . " In twenty years she and her mother had not had an exchange like that . Hypnotized , Cam listened in . " Depressed , ' " said Magdalene . " That 's a word your generationmade up . In my day , we had the blues . " " So , whatever you called it , what did you do when you had the blues ? " " I 'll tell you what I 've always done , because , let 's face it , my life has not been one long picnic . I got the idea from my eighthgradeteacher . Sister Mathilde . The woman was a genius . I think she had a Ph.D . from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one day when we were alone , just the two of us , I was helping her with the altar , she said , What 's up , Magdalene ? ' I said , Sister , I 've got the blues . ' She said , You know what I do when I 've got the blues . I take a piece of paper , a piece of ordinary paper . I fold it in half . On one side of the page I write down all the things I have to be grateful for . On the other side I write my problems . Then I take the piece of paper . I rip it in half , and I throw both halves in the garbage . ' " Cam knew that she could never , hearing this story , have presentedMagdalene with the kind of rapt , grateful look that took over Kevin 's face . For years , in exasperation , she had listened to her mother 's non sequiturs , astonishing misinformation , conclu/sions drawn from premises impossible to trace . A night or two before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had , Magdalenehad said , " My generation did n't have dreams . We were too busy . " And Kevin seemed to believe her . Cam stood in the kitchen , at once furious at their complicitous stupidity and jealous that someone else could make her mother feel so happy , so intelligent , so prized . When Magdalene got sick , Cam did n't notice Kevin . He stayed in the background , visiting , but only when the family was n't there . At that time , Magdalene turned to her daughter in panic ; feeling herself near death , she felt only someone of her blood could keep her from it , or accompany her to it when the moment came . As Magdalene withdrew for her demise , Kevin stayed around , keeping the business going , reporting to Magdalene , making money for her , giving her more than her share . In the early years of Cam 's marriage , as it gradually became evident that Magdalene would n't die , Kevin took up again his role as Magdalene'scompanion , but only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were often , in the days when they went out together , meeting up with other couples to avoid being by themselves . By the time Cam looked up from the bombed-out site of her marriage , she found she was n't without help in her problems with her mother . By the time she understood , Kevin had been helping her for years . He had matured ; he was no longer the moonish boy whose skewed erotic source was Magdalene . He lived with a companion ; he had become part of a circle in which he could be himself . Cam and Kevin developed a relationship of co-conspirators . Magdalene does n't know that Cam and Kevin speak to each other every day . They talk about their own lives , but mainly they have grieved or anxious conversations , sometimes carefully sardonic : the talk of connoisseurs . Their subject is Magdalene . They 've never allowed Magdalene to know that over the years they have become a bulwark to each other . It is a necessary fictionp173for Magdalene that Cam and Kevin are antagonists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Magdalene hopes Kevin will tell her she does n't have to go Vincent and Ellen 's house . She takes one earring off as she tal to him on the phone . " Cam does n't know what I go through , " she says . " She thin everything 's as easy for me as it is for her . " " I know , darling . Just try . One step at a time . You never t ( me what you 'll wear . " " I ca n't make up my mind . What did you say , the purple was thinking that too , only the shoes kill my feet . " HARRIET D U F F Y KNOCKS ON VINCENT 'S DOOR . WITout his answering , she opens the door a bit , and sti ( her little bird 's head in the room . " Yoo-hoo , " she says . " I hope you were n't thinking of shovi off without saying goodbye . " He wishes he were wearing a hat , so he could tip it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men longer tip their hats . In the old days , you 'd tip your hat wh you passed a church . He wonders when all that stopped . Itsomething to do with John Kennedy ; after him , men stopp wearing hats . " A little going-away present for you , then , " she says . could n't resist . " She hands him a package wrapped in rainbow-colored tis5. paper . Stuck to the top is a yellow bow . He opens the box . 1 a tie , red plaid , wider than the ties he wears . " I made it myself , " she says . " It 's my new hobby , making ti My daughters bring me their old clothes , their old dresses , anp174just make ties out of the scraps . Sometimes they 've got big stains on them or holes from I do n't know what . But I do n't let anything go to waste . We were brought up like that , you and me , Vincent , were n't we ? Waste not , want not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just grateful they let me have my machine here . " " My wife was an excellent needlewoman , " he says . He wants Ellen 's presence in the room . Harriet Duffy makes him uncomfortable . There 's something funny about the way she treats him . Wanting to give him her desserts . Asking if he wants to watch a game on the television in her room . He knows she is n't interested in baseball . Knocking on the door for him , so he can walk her down to dinner . He feels it 's wrong . He feels it 's wrong to Ellen . Ellen ca n't help herself . If she was her old self , she 'd never allow Harriet Duffy to get this familiar . Whenever women seemed to want to get too friendly , Vincent only had to introduce them to Ellen . Seeing her , they knew they did n't have a chance . This Harriet is taking advantage of Ellen 's position . Ellen 's position : lying in a bed , her eyes looking up at the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anymore . He feels that Harriet is hovering around Ellen 's bed , waiting for something , like those witches that waited around deathbeds at home , and then , when the moment came that they 'd been waiting for , the death itself , they 'd set up their wail . Except you knew they were n't sorry . Harriet wants something from him as a man . He 'll have no part of it . " I 'm much obliged to you , " he says . She walks over to him . She opens her arms . He can tell she wants him to kiss her . He holds his arm out stiffly to her , keeping her back . He shakes her hand . When she goes out the door , his eyes fix on her disappointed back . He is sorry to hurt her , but he ca n't help it . You have to be who you are.  |p175DAN  AND CAM TURN TOWARDS THE TWO LOCAL STORES : Johansen 's Deli , Friedman 's Candy Store . " Do you remember , that magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best part , " Cam says . Dan tries to understand who the magazine was meant for . Contractors , builders , someone his grandfather came across at work ? What genius made him know children would like something like that ? Or did he simply bring it home ? He and Cam studied the floor plans , they talked about the architecture of each house . They never talked about the photographs . He knew that she , too , had her treacherous , her shameful dreams . It 's thirty-six years later , a summer afternoon . The light is changing . The trees that are rich with leaves now were saplings when the houses they walk in front of were built . Slapped up , their grandfather had said : the only contempt he ever showed , a workman 's for bad work . Each summer when they were children walking down this street a house , two houses would grow up . The vacant lots they treasured disappeared ; the exposed roots , the colorless , downtrodden grass , the severe wild chrysanthemums , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shards of broken glass , the inexplicable and random objects they found frightening  --  a single shoe , a handbag  --  all these were dug under . And the new houses slapped up . There was a moment when the mourning for the lot was over and they could n't decide which they preferred : the flat space where they could invent landscape , or the bare , challenging , inviting bones of the new house and all the objects that the workmen left at night . Useful by day : barrels of nails , work aprons , cement mixers , wheelbarrows , files , yardsticks , rolls of tape . By day the things were taken up . The barechestedmen pushed the heavy wheelbarrows full of wet cement ,  |p176frightened  the children with their hammer blows , the noise of their electric saws , but stopped , some of them , for a minute to be friendly till a mother saw and made the children leave . " Do n't play by the new houses , " every mother shouted every morning as the children banged the screen doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go near those houses . Keep away . " But the children obeyed no one , and no one was hurt . Dan looks at Cam , walking beside him on the streets they 've walked on all their lives . All the romance children might have put into trips , holidays at the seaside , vacations to the mountains went into these walks he took with Cam . For they never went anywhere else . Not once in all their childhood had they gone anywhere . And was it a mistake ? He thought of the failed vacations he had taken with his children . He thought that really what children loved was routine . Change as an idea delighted them , and the voyage itself might give them pleasure , but a strange place was a danger : they were always wanting to be home . Better , perhaps , these walks , these trips to vacant lots or halfbuilthouses , than the trips he took his children on . To Disney World , when they were nine and ten . There was an unexpected cold spell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only summer clothes . They shivered ; then , ineptly , he had to buy them an overpriced , unsatisfying wardrobe of warmer clothing in a shop in the hotel . All the time that he was buying the girls their pants and sweaters , he was worried that Val would be angry , accuse him of trying to win them by one more indulgencethat she would not or could not match . " You have them for a month , buy them everything ; then they expect it from me and throw it in my face . Be real , Dan , just for once , " she 'd said to him the last summer . How could he be more real ? They wanted ; he could give ; he gave . Was a father 's real role denial ? Was that what she meant ? He had had no father ; he would never know . Perhaps he was not a real father . They 'd stood on the interminable lines of Disney World . He told Cam later what it was like . Disney World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood behind men he had nothing in common with , men he would never have spoken to , except they now shared an estate : they were waiting on lines with impatient , cranky children . Men with sunburned necks , white creases where they bent their heads . Beefy half-boys wearing satin jackets with the names of high-school teams , recently left , embroidered on the back . Blacks in leisure suits or sweating , as he did , in too-warm jackets : proof and uniform of uneasy tenancy in the middle class . These men who in any other setting would have fallen within minutesinto insult or tense silence made sympathetic comments to each other on the weather , the scandalous price of the drinks . They pointed out to one another the locations of the bathrooms . Failures in the company of failures , they became kinder . Almost womanly , they shared domestic troubles ; they gave advice . For the first day of the vacation , the children were amused . But he had rented the hotel rooms not for one day , but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting . Fights like brushfiresthat started from nowhere , were quenched , and started up in the same place , for no reason , again . It was Darci who dissolved in tears . What she wanted , Dan could see , was her father to herself . And Staci wanted no part of either of them . She drew back into the armor of her discontent , disliking everything , but silently , or saying why did n't they just stay in the hotel room and watch television , everything was so expensive . " Such a rip-off , " she kept saying , " Dad , you 're being so ripped off . " Then Darci would say , " Jesus , Staci , you have got to be the world 's most boring human being . " Staci would walk out of the room , as if responding to such comments was beneath her . Dan agreed with Darci ; he felt they should keep trying to enjoy this place where others of their kind so famously had enjoyed themselves . But they did n't enjoy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on a street that 's changed entirely within their lifetime . They link arms . Male , female , but children together.  |p178They  can walk , their arms together ; they 're no danger to each other ; in this difference of sex there 's nothing of fear , desire , contempt . They share blood . Memory . A childhood . They were brought up by people who were old when they were young , whose death they had to fear each morning , whose love had too much in it of anxiety . They were fatherless children of mothers who were absent or useless in their love . They have only to look at each other and all this is understood . They head back to the house . Once inside , they walk into their grandmother 's room . For this moment , she sleeps , her mouth open , miraculously not grotesque , her hair in two thin plaits under her shoulders . Dan stands on one side of the bed and Cam stands in the doorway . Ellen wakes . Her eyes focus on nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She cries out : the sacrilegious cry of someone who has lost her place among her kind . Cam hears this sound and feels terror first , then anger . She ca n't do anything for her grandmother . She does n't know what her grandmother sees . She 's horrified by the avidity for life those eyes express ; as if simply to be not dead was what she craved with a hunger that was unseemly in its plainness . What could inspire the look behind those eyes , that terror , that anger , that unmediated request for deliverance ? But deliverance from what ? Cam feels that if she could simply name the thing her grandmother sees , could describe in solid language what goes on behind her grandmother'seyes , those eyes that are n't dead but are perhaps not quite human , she could help her . Not knowing how to name the thing , she 's helpless . Her helplessness makes her angry . She hates that , being of no help . John , Theresa 's son , comes and stands beside her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the repairs he 'd promised to do months ago . On the last day , working too hastily , Cam sees , he 's bungled . She worries what this will do to Vincent on his first day home.  | " I 'll sit with her a while , " John says . Cam nods . She never knows what to say to John . His life is ruined . He is a wreck , Cam thinks , thirty-seven , sitting in a wrecked life . She wonders who is to blame . She 'd like to think it was Theresa , but her work has made her chary of the automatic blame placed on mothers by everyone from Ann Landers to the Family Court judge . John was one of those boys living on the margin all their lives . Should you look to coded genetic messages : did something in John 's body program him for marginal living ? Should you look to the neighborhood , the schools , and say : If not this friend , if only this teacher ? Or should you look to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they despaired , or they were lazy , they lost heart . In the end , what did it matter , Cam thinks , looking at John . She sees that somehow sitting beside Ellen  --  she 's quiet now John is happy . She wants to thank him for all the time he 's spent with Ellen this year . But she does n't thank him ; she could never talk to him , and it 's dangerous , with someone like John , to interrupt some moment not devoted to making his life worse . She wo n't say anything to him now ; he seems happy . John holds his grandmother 's hand . He is thinking that perhaps he 'll study to become a nurse . He checks his grandmother 's pulse , as if for practice . He looks up at the IV tube sending glucose to her arm as if he could discern its proper function or its failures , be the one to rightly raise alarm . His sister is a nurse . He likes his sister . He has always liked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost happy and he thinks he 's had a good idea : he 'll study and become a nurse . He thinks he 'll work in a veterans ' hospital . Or else a nursing home . He sits , holding his grandmother'shand , a claw . In his mind , he performs perfectly at two interviews : one at a veterans ' hospital , one at a nursing home . He tells the interviewer that he 's had so many offers , he 'll have to sleep on it , be sure he 's making the right choice . He wants to tell his grandmother he knows what he 'll do now . He will study , he 'll become a nurse . He thinks that this wouldp180please her . It will please his sister Marilyn , whom he likes . He could have a job like her . Sitting beside his grandmother , he has already done it , gone to school , trained in the hospital . It looms before him , solid as a house , all this accomplishment . Accepting it as fact , he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside the door , John 's father , Ray Dooley , is thinking : My son , my ruined son . He does n't know how to begin to understand him . How can he understand this son , how can he understand himself , how can he recognize himself as a father ? He 's so different from his own father that they should call themselves by other names . How can he understand this son ? The refusals , the sleeping until three o'clock on filthy sheets , the joblessness accepted like a natural fate or a deformity , the anger if someone suggests that he should do something , anything , the freedom this son feels to say dreadful things to his parents , profane or wounding . To the parents in whose house , at thirty-seven , he still lives , and shows no sign of leaving , or wanting to leave . And watching all of it , as he has always done throughout his family 's life , Ray Dooley stands back , puzzled and uncomprehending , certain that his wife knows something he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something that he does not . Ray stood at the side for all the family life , clumsy , balked , and silent , frightened by his wife 's clenched-teeth anger , by her punishing cold gestures to the children , whom he could see wither in her presence , whom he did not see prosper beside her . They should do that , he thought , mother and children , prosper and be pleased . But she was the woman , she must know about the children , he knew nothing , his world was the world outside , the precinct , money , the silent life of men . She was the one that spent all day with them . He came in only after they were fed , dressed , ready for sleep . How could he know them ? On the weekends he held another job at a box factory as a security guard . And then , when the kids were grown , Theresa went to work , as Larry Riordan 's secretary . For a while she made almost as much as Ray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs the place , Larry Riordan had said , before he , too , retired . Now she works for a group practice , knows computers , everything . The things he does n't know . He saw how the cold knot of her contempt and her indifference froze the family life . He saw it but did nothing , could not raise his hand to cover or to shelter the three children , his and yet not his , whom he had loved in silence , in confusion , in despair . He 'd loved them paralyzingly from birth , and could n't say it ; he 'd watched them grow into their unhappiness like some dark coat passed down , one to another . And the youngest , John , had never given it up . The girls seemed all right now . But John was drowningin his life . Ray saw it , and said nothing . He watched and he grieved . John is not unhappy now . He is thinking of comradely jokes about bedpans and midnight shifts . The young girls , fellow studentnurses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . They are shyly grateful , honored when he asks them out . His grandmother interrupts his dream by openingher wild eyes that see nothing . She screams and bares her gums . He does n't see this as he formerly did , in horror , in terror . Now he sees her with a professional 's eye . Professionally , he moves her blanket half an inch . He smooths her pillow . She settles down , as if he did the things she wanted . And he takes it as a sign . He thinks that after a while , he 'll quit the job in the nursing home ( he 's decided that he 'll choose the job in the nursing home rather than the V. A. hospital : he likes working with old people ) , he 'll move somewhere warmer . To the Sunbelt , out West , maybe , not down South : he hated that , it makes him think of being married and he does n't want to think of that . Arizona , he thinks , New Mexico , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes he had n't thought about the time that he was married . First it was a good time , then it turned bad . Everything started making him sick . The way she looked  --  he ca n't call her his wife , even to himself . And then the way she kept apologizing all the time . It was n't his fault that things ended thatp182way with the job . He was installing and repairing air conditioners . It was all right , he 'd liked it at first , but he got sick of it . He was ready to walk out . But not like that . The day it happened , he was fixing a central air system in one of those fucked-up houses like Gone With the Wind , with the pillars . It was a big job , but he was on top of it . Then the bitch came over and said would he turn down the music , it 's disturbing her . Like she owns music , like she owns him , his life 's not his own , she bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the music up louder . She asked him again  --  I said the music is disturbing me , I have to have it off . He just kept working on the system like he was deaf . The next thing he knew his boss , that guy Lannie that he always got along with , was on top of him . I guess you did n't hear the lady . Well , listen up . Turn the goddamn music off . So he laid him out on the broadloom and just took off in his car , he does n't remember where . He did n't take a thing from the apartment , never ever went back , just kept driving . Till he landed up here . He knows it 's ridiculous , his idea of being a nurse , he 'll never do it , he 's never made anything work , he 's ruined everything in his life . His grandmother begins thrashing , but he does n't try to quiet her . She cries out ; he gets up to look for Marilyn . He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will never be a nurse , or anything . He hates himself for all the details of his happy dream . And then he hates his mother . " Where are you going ? " she asks . " Out , " he says . " That 's a good answer , " she says . " You finished up that work in the garage ? " He pushes past her , out of the house , banging the screen door to offend her . She refuses to show she is offended . Instead , she holds her body so its posture can be read as a reproach.  |p183Theresa  knew from childhood how to hold her body so it would be a reproach . She took her father 's admiration in like moisture , without the slightest gratitude or sense of having been marked by it . Her movements , swift , deliberate , yet drawn out , he looked on with delight . He loved her singing voice , her size-five shoe . Ellen looked into her child 's heart and found it empty , and this left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to inflict upon her daughter any quick , surprising hurt . As if she always wanted some ambush of her daughter so that she could find her , in the glance of her surprise , comprehensible and alive . Theresa 's coldness has been helpful to her in her life . It helps her , daily , in her job . She is a medical secretary . She is the one who hands the patients a form clipped to a clipboard ; if they ask her for a pen or pencil she provides it . Many of the patients feel their spirits shrivel as they are passed the pencil or the pen . But should the patient know that he is dying , or discover herself unhappily pregnant , Theresa will behave as if she did n't know or had n't noticed , as if she were n't the kind of person who could take the trouble to read a patient 's chart . This can be helpful , if the patient 's need is for privacy , rather than fellow feeling . It often is . In her fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic Church . She is one of those people who stand in churches where there are still highly colored leftover statues of the Virgin , still plaques that represent the fourteen stations of the cross . She is one of those people who lift up their arms and cry out , lay their hands upon the sick and dying , expecting to be healed or that they themselves will heal . These people , mostly in late middle age , brought up on a ritual impersonal and formal as a face of stone , then told to leave all that , feel moved to stand and cry out " Praise the Lord " as if they had just been given the good news of their salvation from a wild-eyed preacher holding in his hands his oversized and rusty hat . They stand together in these churches built with bingo money or with dollars that parishionersthrust in the basket , dollars sealed in numbered envel/opes recorded by the pastor for his records and the IRS . They stand together in these churches , crying " Praise the Lord , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If they are teenagers they sing and play the tambourine . At the age of sixty-four , Theresa Dooley 's days are shaped by morning Mass ( in which she stands at the Consecration with her arms outstretched ) , lunchtime prayer meetings ( attended by local housewives or people employed in local businesses who give up their lunch hours to hold hands together in a circle and to pray for guidance , healing , world peace , the end to pre-marital sex , abortion , homosexuality , divorce ) . Two evenings a week , . after she has dried the dishes from the modest , pre-frozen meal she slipped into the microwave for herself and Ray , and John ( if he decided to come down ) , she gets into her car and travels to the house of one of her group members for Bible study . She remembersthat until the Council she , a Catholic , had been told it was a sin to read scripture by yourself without the guidance of a priest . They laugh , Theresa 's group members , to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group believes in healing . Every day they pray for Ellen , whom they call only " Theresa 's mother . " Hearing this , Theresa feels a flame of inward joy that her name in the group has blotted out her mother 's name . And as she sits beside her mother , she turns her mind to God and readies herself to lay her hands upon her mother so that she may heal . But she does not lay on hands . She looks at her mother , sees her mother 's eyes , which wildly focus upon nothing , hears her mother mutter words of unimaginable filth , hears her cry out with no sense that someone might be listening , like an animal who lives for herself only . Hearing all this , seeing this , she is satisfied . She says in her mind : This is the will of the Lord . She does not touch her mother . Deliberately , she folds her hands.  |p185DAN  GOES TO THE TELEPHONE , MORE PUBLIC ON THEhallway table than he would like . It occurs to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . Nothing important was communicated by them over the telephone ; they always answered uncomfortably , anxious to get off . He is phoning Sharon Breen , whom he lives with . She works as a paralegal for a law firm in Riverhead . Even answering the phone " Maclntosh , Canino and DeFries , " even with her professionalupbeat timbre , he can hear the underlying weariness . He hears her voice and thinks : " I 've failed to make her happy . " They have n't married after all this time . " How 's it going ? " she says . " Nobody 's killed anyone yet . Not bad for the house of Atreus . " She laughs . Once , when she was taking a course on Greek tragedy at the community college where she got her associate degree , she read The Oresteia . She said she 'd enjoyed reading it because it was a relief to find a family that was worse off than hers . He wants her to come today , he 'd like her to be there with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather 's coming home , and he 'd like her to be there beside him . But he knows she wo n't come . She 'll never come to Vincent and Ellen 's house . She 's too ashamed . Shame , he thinks , that unmodern emotion , stains Sharon 's life like a dye . It weakens her , it slows down the growth of muscle , bone . She 's still ashamed of what happened twelve years ago , in June 1973 . In January 1973 Cam hired Sharon Breen as a secretary , causing scandal in local legal circles by announcing that secretaries werep186exploited and underpaid and giving Sharon a salary a third higher than the highest-paid secretary in town . Sharon had graduated from the nuns ' school that Ellen had refused to allow Cam to attend . She was the child of an electrician and his Irish-born wife , one of eight children . Her good grades in high school did n't mean that she 'd go on to college ; she went , instead , to Wood Secretarial School on a scholarship and married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier danced with at the Senior Prom . She was attentive , quiet , naturally sweet ; she 'd been told she was pretty , but she had no idea what that meant . She liked herself in the mirror  --  her light-brown hair , her wide blue eyes , her skin with its high color  --  but it seemed to her to count for nothing in the world . A melancholy hung around her , but she told herself her life was good , and there was nothing to explain why she seemed to herself unhappier than other people . She moved into an apartment six blocks from her parents and was happy to be hired in an office near her home ; it meant that she need not commute and so would have more time for household occupations . She enjoyed her new apartment , enjoyed decorating it ; she was fond of her husband and assumed most wives discoveredthey had married boys . She worshipped Dan and Camille MacNamara ; she loved her job . She would do anything for either of them . Cam was delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mary Dolan , Jack 's secretary for thirtysevenyears , who had known Cam all her life and insisted upon calling her , even in private , Mrs. Ulichni , although it was Camille MacNamara on the letterhead and on the door . Each morning when Cam walked into the office , the sight of Mary Dolan , always there before her , made Cam feel petulant , resentful , in the mood to pick a fight . Sharon seemed to have all Mary Dolan 's virtues and none of her lacerating faults . Her efficiency was rich and maternal where Mary Dolan 's was deprivational and dry . Sharon blushed easily and seemed overcome when praised ; at the same time , she soon felt free not to ask permission or advice on every detail.  |p187Cam  began inviting her to lunch and then to family functions . To Cam this was proof of the success of democracy and justice in the workplace . No need to treat your employees like lepers or like slaves ; there was a place for everyone and everyone could be happy in his place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . She saw that Mary Dolan knew it , and watched her eyes sharpen in joyous recording of Cam 's error , and in expectation that Sharon would neglect her work . She never did ; it was Dan whose work suffered . There was no way that Cam could talk to Dan . He 'd moved away into a state where he 'd become unrecognizable , carried out of reach . He floated in some atmosphere of sexual intoxication , absorbed , oblivious , addicted : closed . She saw him float away from her and from his work . And from the family . She saw that he was happy and that made it worse . She felt as if he 'd been picked up by the nape of the neck , seized in the beak of some predatory bird : swirled through an atmosphere of confusion and disregard . Dan was amazed at what had happened to him . He thought he was the most fortunate man in the world , and the most cursed . His adolescence had been free entirely of coupling : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept out with rigor , with contempt , made it unlikely that he would come into normal contact with girls . Overlarge and awkward , he believed himself so undesirable that he pitied in the abstract any girl he might attract . Pitying them , in advance he spared them , spared himself . Morosely he attended dances sponsored by the CYO ; he stood in corners with his buddies , smoked , desired silently , went home . He joked with Cam 's friends but they were older . They thought he was wonderful and wished there were somebody their age like him that they could talk to . He understood . He met Valerie O'Keefe in freshman year at Haverford ; she was the roommate of his roommate 's girl . Valerie felt what every woman did about Dan : that he liked her , that he was n't askingp188questions to make a fool of her , or as filler until the moment when he could make a dive for one of her breasts . She knew that she could happily , freely read with him the poetry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the buses to Mississippi . They kissed in dark places or behind trees ; once they kissed lying down together at the shore of the lake where her family owned a cottage . Val was surprised by Dan 's desire , her surprise made him ashamed . In marriage they could give each other pleasure , but Dan felt always the force of his wife holding something back , something he could n't name , place , or describe , but guessed was there for other women , other men . But in the arms of Sharon Breen , whose desire for him seemed to him the same as his for her , Dan felt himself allowed into one more part of life . Another door he 'd feared closed to him because of the flawed history that marked him an outsider , was now open . He felt blessed , anointed , miraculously reprieved . Astonished , he saw himself the lover of a beautiful receptive woman , who wept after orgasm , begged him to hold her , make love to her once again , whose body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one has made me feel like this . " His pride made him feel what he 'd never felt with a woman . Fully adult . He thought he made her happy . He was right , she loved him , and , to his surprise , bloomed underneath his fattish body , its chest covered with red hair that she called gold . He wanted to give her back the pleasure he had had , to make her feel that she could open up and flower , then collect , grow still in her success , and rest . He felt he could . He waited to see what would happen . It could n't go on , the daily lovemaking at six o'clock , when the office had finally emptied , saying they could n't leave , how could they leave each other , but then leaving , going on to the rest of their lives . Dan felt he 'd tainted each part of his life that had , only a month ago , been nourishing . He would leave Sharon and go to his grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the news , curse Nixon withp189his grandmother . He stopped by his grandparents ' each day after leaving Sharon , wanting , really , to put his head on his grandmother'slap , smell the overwashed smell of her apron , hold the hands he 'd as a child played games with : this finger , and this and this . At work Cam 's pretending not to see grew up like a wall between them . At home he hid from the flaring heat of his children 's lives and Val 's efficient managing . He saw himself a boy running from locked door to locked door . They had been right , he thought , those people who had warned against pleasure . He had followed pleasure , and it had brought him here , desperate , and once again without a home . Both he and Sharon knew that something would happen to change things . It was almost as if the incompleteness of the situation was fatiguing ; later he wondered if Sharon had done what she had done out of boredom , as someone might dive into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more second waiting for the weather to break up . She told her husband about Dan , one night when they had been comradely , unsexual : the childhood friends that they always were to each other in some way . It seemed then that she could simply tell him , and everything could go on as it had . Only there would be no need for the burden of her deceit . He would understand that Dan gave her something she had always dreamed of but had never thought could be hers , something that had nothing to do with him : they were husband and wife ; in a year or so , she would stop things with Dan and have a baby . She imagined that Jerry Breen would be momentarily saddened , then permanently ennobled : she would love him more than ever , things would be better than anyone had dreamed . But the moment she had got the words out , she saw what she had done . Jerry let out a hissing breath , as if his body tried to make sense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and turned the engine off . He did n't move . She told him they had to go on , go home now , she would stop with Dan if it meantp190this much to him , she had been horribly mistaken , could she take it back ? But he would n't move . She was afraid that she had killed him , so she sat in the dark with him silently , comforted that at least she could hear his breath . He refused to sleep in the bed beside her . In the morning , he did n't go to his job at Friendly Frost Appliances ; he went to his mother . Rita Breen was Irish-born . She made corsets in the back room of her house and sold them to portly , old-fashioned women who kept up in their persons an out-of-date physical pride . She 'd taken the stiffness of the product she manufactured and built her nature on it . Unbending , she kept her husband and her sons in terrified and grateful places , fixed far below the one she settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weep , and she felt he had been violated in some tribal , public way . It seemed to her that the reparation for this should also be tribal and public . She drove him first to the parish priest , who approved the course of her action . She took him next to Sharon 's parents , who accepted what was told them in grim silence , and assured the Breens their daughter would not be sheltered in her old home once again . Then she took him to Valerie 's house in Stony Brook ; she told her son the other injured party had the right to know ; it would be unfair to Valerie , Rita Breen said , that one part of the puzzle , hers , should remain incomplete . She left him at Val 's house ; she did n't get out of the car . She drove to a luncheonette and had a tuna sandwich and a cigarette . In half an hour , she came back to get him , honking the horn , refusing to come in . Jerry got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have bucked him up . " She said that everything would be all right , " he told his mother . " She said it would be seen to somehow , that . we should n't worry . " But Rita Breen was still unsatisfied . She drove her son to the office , where Jack Morrisey , and Cam and Dan and Sharon were at work . She came up the stairs with Jerry ; she said she did n't think he was a match for them , three lawyers , and himself notp191even with a college education , and too forgiving in his nature : he 'd be scalped . At the sight of Sharon , sitting at the front desk , Jerry broke down in tears again . " I suppose you know why we 're here , " Rita Breen said , and of course Sharon did . She showed them into the conference room and shut the door . Her cheeks burned and she did n't know whom to go to . Obviously , they had come to see Dan . But she felt Cam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up to Rita Breen . But how could she get Cam from her office to the conference room ? They 'd never taken Cam into their confidence ; it would be terrible to tell her now . She knocked on Dan 's door . He greeted her with a look that was so full of pleasure that for a moment she forgot why she was there . But then he saw that she was troubled , and she only had to say : " Jerry and his mother are in the conference room . I guess we have to speak to them . " He held her for a moment and said , " It 's all right , it 's going to be all right , " but neither of them believed it . On the way to the conference room , they ran into Cam , who 'd buzzed Sharon and was prepared to be annoyed that she was n't responding . She saw Dan 's and Sharon 's faces , which shared , perhaps because they both were so fair , a kind of transparency : when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features was designed to hide distress . The three of them went into Cam 's office . They explained the situation . " All right , " she said . " All right . " She started walking . " They ca n't do anything to us . They have no right to be here . Do n't worry . This is the twentieth century . And I have a lot of friends among the criminal classes . We can always have her shot . " She led the way into the conference room . She began speaking as she walked in the door , closing it aggressively , aware that Mary Dolan had a good idea of what was going on and hoping to make her afraid to speculate further . " Mrs. Breen , " she said . " I believe you think you have something to say . "  |p192For  a moment , Rita Breen lost her bearings . Cam sat across from her , and stared hard at her hands , having noticed that Rita Breen bit her nails and hoping to make her feel found out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to cry . " Do n't think you can push us around , " Rita Breen said , turning her eyes to Dan and Sharon : she had n't yet the courage to look straight at Cam . Jerry 's infantilism and Rita 's protectiveness made Cam impatient . " What exactly do you want to happen now ? " she said . They were silent . It was as if they had n't thought of it : all that had occurred to them , to Rita Breen particularly , was to make a scene . No subsequent , resulting action had crossed any of their minds . Cam pressed her point . " Well , there are several alternatives . Would you like financial recompense , Jerry ? Is that what you have in mind ? Recompense for loss of rights of consortium , it 's called , there are precedents . Or you could sue for , I believe it 's called alienation of affections . Or perhaps you 'd like a divorce on the grounds of adultery . Of course that would involve private detectives , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , Jerry ? " she said . " Nobody 's talking about money , " Rita Breen said . " No , Mrs. Breen ? " said Cam , standing . " What are we talking about ? " Rita Breen seemed to remember . She stood up , across the table from Cam . " I just think people should know what 's been done , " she said . " I just do n't think people should get away scot-free . " Cam saw that Rita Breen was getting brave . " If we do n't make much of a fuss , everything will die down and things can go on as they did before , " Cam said . " You 're saying you want them to get away scot-free . " " Well , Mrs. Breen , I 've asked you . What 's your solution ? " Cam could see inspiration spread over Rita Breen 's face . Shep193pulled at the waistband of her cotton skirt . Cam thought she saw her tugging at her corset . " I said , I just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see your grandparents . " This was more than Dan could bear . " You wo n't do that , you ca n't , " he said . Rita Breen wore a look of triumph . " I 'm going to right now . Try and stop me . " She walked out the door , quickly , before she could be stopped . Like a comic parade , Dan , Cam , and Sharon followed her and Jerry . They said nothing as they passed Jack Morrisey and Mary Dolan , who looked as if they knew everything . On the sidewalk , Cam grabbed Rita Breen roughly by the arm . " If you go near my grandparents ' house I 'll  --  " " You 'll what ? " said Rita Breen with a sour smile . " Sue ? " She walked down the sidewalk , swinging her hard , rectangular pocketbook , letting it bump against her leg . Cam 's car was parked behind the office ; she , Dan , and Sharon piled into it like policemen chasing robbers . They were determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in the car , " Cam said . " I 'll tell them . " Vincent was not at home . As plainly as she could , Cam explainedthe situation to Ellen . " Foolishness from beginning to end , " Ellen said . Then she remembered it was Dan who 'd been attacked . " If that cute bitch with her hen's-ass mouth comes over here thinking she 's about to shock me , or I 'm about to stroke her poor boy 's brow , she 's stupider than even I think she is . Going to the parish priest . I 'm sure she made him feel right as rain . She 'll be sorry she set her foot in this part of town when I 'm through with her . " Ellen walked to the front porch wiping her hands on her apron . She was standing on the porch when Rita Breen walked up the path . " I know what you 're here for , Rita Breen , and you can takep194yourself off my property or I 'll have the police on you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mrs. MacNamara . I just thought you should know the goings-on in your own family . " " If I want the news I 'll listen to the radio . Now , get out of here , and fast , or you 'll spend the night in jail . " Dan and Sharon watched this from the back seat of Cam 's car where they sat holding hands . It made neither of them happier , Ellen 's performance ; it did n't make them feel vindicated , or protected , or redeemed ; their gratitude and pride in her made their shame unbearable . Sharon saw that Ellen kept her back straight until the Breens were out of sight . Then she saw that Ellen leaned on Cam a moment to walk into the house . She thought then that she should leave Dan forever , since what they had done had made Ellen turn a corner ; they had made her old . But Sharon and Dan did n't separate . It would have been possible , after Ellen 's victory , that everything could have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to find another job , but she and Dan could have stopped seeing each other ; she could have gone back to Jerry ; no one outside their families knew anything about it , except Jack Morrisey and Mary Dolan and Father Lynch , who would use their information for silent punishment , but keep it silent all the same . But Val would n't take Dan back . Or , rather , she insisted upon giving him away . She was n't outraged by his infidelity , she 'd been unfaithful first , and realized how little it could mean . It was that in seeing Dan choose Sharon , who was beautiful and sensual and lush , she understood how wrong she was for him . She realized that beside him she would never feel quite like a woman ; he needed somebody who was , like him , slightly overfull . Sharon 's physical being supported all the ideas Val had about men and women . She did n't blame men for it : who would n't prefer Sharon 's voluptuous , dreamy abundance to her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Sharon was weaker than she ; she convinced herself that Sharon needed Dan more than she did , and therefore shep195should give him up . The weakness of women had always been a sacred idea to her ; her mother had been an invalid ; Val had seen her own energy as a failure to come up to the female ideal . She saw how lovable it was , this idea of woman 's weakness . She understood what had come of it , the cluster of ideas that grew up around the picture of the vulnerable woman , the inventions it inspired : fashions to encase , enclose the soft bones that surround the emptiness at the center , sanctuaries , stories , operettas , tragedies , things she never would want given up , the rituals of adoration , of protection that were so touching and so beautiful they must be true . She saw herself a skeleton : functional , dry . She had produced two children freakishly , the goose who laid , because it had been called for , golden eggs . She could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having come from Dan as well as herself , would need protection . She would not take them away from him , but she could no longer live beside him . She made him see that she was n't angry , but that he could no longer live beside her in the house . It was jarring , their contiguity ; it was a false picture . He belonged with Sharon now , it was impossible that he could go on living in the house , beside her , as if they belonged together , as if that were right . To Dan she said only , " It 's better if you move out . " Dan had no recourse ; if she had said he had to go , he felt he should . She never told him all the reasons she had for his leaving ; she grew harder , colder , every day , until both of them understood that life together was impossible . Jerry Breen had moved out of the apartment ; Sharon was there alone . It was unnatural that Dan stay away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they made a shelter for each other and a place where each could live . After a month of living in the apartment that , after all , belonged to Jerry Breen , Dan made the dispiriting search of the unhoused adulterer for an abode . He spoke to bored and surly building managers in apartment complexes horribly designed to seem opulent . I have two children , he would tell them . Maybe in thep196summers this could be good for them : the swimming pool . They 'd seen it all , the building managers , the children in the summers , on the weekends , bored and anxious and impatient to go home . In those days , Dan walked around like a man recovering from a gunshot wound . Sometimes he and Sharon would rouse themselves from their miasma of shame and lethargy , punctuated by tentative withholding sex , and go out to a store to shop for furnitureor linens for the new home they felt themselves forced to make . She could see how , beside Dan , she appeared desirable , enviable , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her veins with joy like a transfusion of fresh blood . She could pretend that they were starting out together on a wonderful adventure , that Dan would be hers now , forever ; this wonderful man would be hers . Almost , then , eating cheeseburgers in the shopping-mall luncheonettes , they could feel they had not been shot dead . But then he 'd see something  --  a tricycle in a store window , a horse that could be made to buck by the insertion of two nickels , a child the age of one of his  --  and he 'd feel himself a danger and a poison , he would look at Sharon and think : Sooner or later , I will poison her too . He visited his children in the house that was no longer his . Darci at five had grown already into her real nature : ardent , tense , alert . She was vengeful , terrible , when he prepared to leave . He would drive away , seeing in his mind 's eye her sullen and destructive tantrums behind the closed door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four when he left , had a notion of him as only absence , a language the others in the family spoke easily that she had never learned , a blank door she would never open , never even approach . It went on like this for two years , the time of the subpoenas , the divorce ( his friend Joe Murphy represented him , but could not hold him back from giving away too much ) . It made him feel slightly less monstrous to see that his wife and children lived like the others on the street , the ones with real fathers who planted grass on the mean , unhopeful lawns and in the winter shoveledp197the thin sidewalks . After two years , the divorce became final ; Sharon 's divorce , much simpler , had come through a year before . Dan asked her to marry him , but she refused . They 've been together for twelve years ; he 's asked her to marry him many times . Each time he asks her , she thinks of Ellen , turning her tired back on Rita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a legitimate place in the MacNamara family . It was n't only Ellen , she believes , whom she 'd weakened and made old . Six months after she and Dan moved in together , Jack Morrisey retired . For thirty years , he 'd kept up a correspondence with a Paracletist missionary who 'd spent his priesthood in the Philippines . Jack had never met him , but when the priest retired to a small parish in South Carolina , where his family had settled , Jack joined him and bought a house nearby . Sharon knows that Jack left because the direction in which Cam moved the practice did n't please him . He lost his bearings in Cam 's wave of feminist energy ; he never wanted to handle divorce , wife battering , difficult custody cases ; now these made up the bulk of the firm 's cases . That was true , Sharon knew that , but it was n't all the truth . The truth , she felt , was that seeing what had happenedwith her and Dan made Jack Morrisey want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house ; she sees Cam , rarely , at the house she and Dan built in Quogue ; she likes serving Cam meals , but she ca n't be at ease with her . She carries the shame of what she did to Dan and to his family , a weakening disease . She lives her life always a bit under the weather ; like a patient getting over pneumonia . Her employers encourage her to go to law school , but she refuses . She and Dan live quietly , devotedly , but she is not his wife , she wo n't allow herself to be . She took him from his wife , and she insists they both remember . Approaching middle age , they understand that they will be together , now , for life . But they have never said this to each other ; they feel they have no right to promise . Their house is half a mile from the Long Island Sound ; they walk , each morning , by the water ; they see friends from Sharon 's office , they collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a cloud everyone can sense , so they are n't popular with other couples . Dan will never get over the loss of his children ; she ca n't give up her shame that it was through her this loss came about . Every year , the girls come for August and life is different . Sharon accepts her displacement in the situation ; Dan cooks for them : hamburgers , Kraft macaroni and cheese , Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee ravioli , coral-colored in the pot . Her attempts with the girls have always been hobbled by her sense of shame in their presence : naturalness is impossible , and she knows what takes its place . Darci despises her , she 's glad not to be living with Sharon , but with Cam . And Staci uses her . Sharon is not deceived that the presents she buys Staci earn anything for her but contempt ; still , she 's afraid to stop ; at least the pretense of connection is better than the freezing look in Staci 's eyes when she is n't being distracted by a new acquisition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocabulary : their friends ' names , the names of the songs they like , their favorite movie stars , their jokes . Then , cruelly , the thread is cut , and in September , she and Dan go back to being what they were : modest , melancholy , and responsible . " I 've got to go , " Sharon says . " We 're so shorthanded . Lisa and Joanne are away . " " Where 'd they go ? " " Lisa went to Paris with her mother ; Joanne is in the Islands with God knows who . " Dan realizes that it 's been three years since he and Sharon have gone away on a vacation . A damp spot of guilt spreads underneath his ribs . " Let 's go to Paris in the fall , " he says . " Or to some beach . " " What beach ? It 's hurricane season in the Islands . " " It 's not hurricane season in Paris . " " Oh , Dan , for heaven 's sake , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that any movement  --  forward or outp199makes her a little anxious . But he thinks he hears in her voice her willingness for him to lead her out . He thinks of them on a plane together . The thought arouses him . After all this time , whatever else has happened , they have not lost that pleasure . " Come on , Irish , " he says , " a plane is a very sexy place . " " Dan , " she says , " everyone can hear you in the hall . " " Only my aunt Theresa , " he says , and they both laugh . But it is n't Theresa who hears them , it 's Sheilah . She hears Dan 's words and understands what 's behind them : the easy life of men and women , the playful life that starts in bed and moves into the world . Love-play . She 's never been a player . She has watched , always outside it , both yearning to be of it and taking her pride and sense of safety from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . She was the quiet girl in glasses with pastel rims , tortoiseshell barrettes held on to past their usefulness , their rightness . She counted up the errors of the others moving out of childhood , out of the bones and flat muscles , the quick legs burnished by the heat of local games : red-rover , ring-a-levio , street games played to the point of death , faces flushed from the last sun of autumn , faces shocked by the quick curtainfall of night in late November . She watched those faces , those bodies ; once they were faultless , but no more . She stood away from them , recording everything . That 's what she 's always done , it 's who she 's always been , the one who watches and stands apart . She can never have what Dan and Sharon have . She 'd stumbled into being joined to Stephen Gallagher ; their coming together had the elements , not of romanticcomedy , but of the most common sort of farce . When she met him , he 'd been Father Gallagher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They met when they participated in a draft-card burning on the steps of the City Hall of Keene , New Hampshire , and became lovers while their vows were still in force . The integrity of their political activities was called into questionp200when they were found by the police in a motel . Just a routine check , Miss  --  or Sister , whatever it is . Their spiked hair , combed wet from the shower , made a joke of everything . The police had brought reporters along . The flash camera , the headlines that read " Nun and Priest Protesters Found in Love Nest . " The day before , they had been heroes , Steve leading the psalms in his workshirt and liturgical stole . Was that why Steve married her ? Because they 'd had their pictures in the paper , with their hair wet from the shower , in front of the Thunderbird Motel ? He was n't interested in sex , not really , even at first . He was interested in being able to say that he , a priest , had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made up to him for losing the distinction of his priesthood . For having become , once again , simply himself , her husband , rather than a priest of God . It had n't measured up . She watches Dan ; she is the child she 's always been with him , yearning , envious , vengeful . Putting down the phone , he turns to her , realizing that she 's overheard . " Hi , there , " he says , self-consciously . She sees that she 's made him uneasy . One of the few people in the world who like her , one of the few people whom she likes . She 's half sorry , half something else she does n't know the name of but recognizes as familiar , partly satisfying : right . STACI ROUNDS THE CORNER OF LINDEN STREET ANDRoberts Avenue and begins to slow her pace . She hasjust run two and a half miles from the G. Michael Hobbspool , where she is a lifeguard . Running , she is the person shewants to be , the person she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight she always wins against the heavy body , heavyin itself despite everything she does . She ca n't make herself entirelyweightless as she would like , and yet that is n't really what shep201wants : she dreads insubstantialness ; it would mean that she would have no force . She would like a body that is muscle and bone , dry , unneeding . Yet that is n't what she wants either , because no one would look at her like that . Without this flesh  --  tan now , the way she likes it , the gold hairs on her arms shining like metal  --  no one would look at her . She could n't sit on the high seat of the lifeguard stand , move her leg an inch , a quarter of an inch and know that she has caused something to happen in the world , know that the boys who jackknife into the water to get a better look at her , who pull their hard white lifeguard hats over their noses to pretend they are n't looking , are doing it for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a pull : the vector of the earth tilts . She is the equator , the pole . She is in charge of gravity . When she runs , when she feels her heart like a knife pressing its blade against her and her lungs two spots , sharp and hot , she does n't succumb to them , she delights in them . She lifts herself above them , and she is lifted up , but moving , nothing can stop her ; they can be looking at her or not looking , she is moving , she is all alone , she could n't possibly need anyone , no one could do her harm . She slows herself down . She is about it lose it . At the first sight of her great-grandparents ' house , she will begin to succumb to its lowering , decelerating , darkening force . She wo n't give herself up . She hardens herself , she makes herself a stone against the force of the house pressing down . When it presses down on her , she will press back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is her safety from harm and desire . She sees her father sitting on the front porch steps beside her cousin Marilyn . She would never let anything happen to her like what happened to Marilyn . Like what keeps happening over and over , though she 's old now , she ought to be finished with that , but it will never be over for her , and Staci does n't know how she could stand to live like that , just waiting for a man to come and do something to her . Staci can tell by the way she sits . Staci does n't want to talk to them . Her father lifts his heavyp202shoulders . She can tell how he 's dying to talk to her , dying for her to come over to him . She wo n't . Every time she sees him everything about him is always telling her something depressing : how much he misses her , he loves her , how sorry he is that he left , he wishes he could love her as much as Darci . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to kick her father over , like one of those bottom-heavy clown toys that you can tip over , but they just come up again and again , asking for it , asking for it , over and over . She wo n't give him what he wants . " Oh , Daddy , I adore you , " Darci is always saying to him . She 'd like to kick the both of them over , running off , just on her way somewhere , one flick of the foot , the two of them . They 're disgustinglyfat . She does n't know how they can let themselves get that way . Neither of them says no to themselves for one minute . Pointing to her watch , and then grabbing hold of her wrist , she pantomimes to her father and Marilyn that she ca n't talk , she 's trying to take her pulse . They wave and smile at her and go on talking . " You look terrific , " her father shouts out . That 's just the kind of thing she hates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up ? At least her mother never does anything like that . At least she leaves her alone . That 's all she wants from people , and they ca n't seem to get it . It 's because they 're always needing something ; they ca n't believe that other people do n't . Opening the latch of the backyard fence she sees her cousin John walking with a hammer in his hand . He scares her . He never says anything to her , just looks at her with those eyes that mean he wants to do something to her , hurt her or punish her . He looks at her in that way that 's already taking something from her . She wo n't let him do that . He looks disgusting . He 's the most disgustingone of them all . He 's always smoking and his teeth are brown , but it 's not just that . Some of them are missing , like he got into a fight . She knows it 's not impossible that he could hit her with that hammer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walk away , leave her there , not look at what he 'd done , notp203even remember it . And her father would n't be able to stop him . She can see her father kneeling over her , crying . " Staci , baby , how did this happen ? " Letting that pig get away . Forgetting to do what he was supposed to do : revenge her . She 's never seen hair as horrible as her cousin John 's . He probably does n't wash it , ever . She 's opened the gate now , and she wo n't let John know that seeing him makes her want to walk away . She 's got to make him know that he could never make her do anything she did n't want to do . Anything she would do would be because she wanted it . She walks around the backyard , pretending to cool down . To return her pulse to normal . But her pulse is faster than it was when she was running . She 's afraid of him , but he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sits down on the step and lights a cigarette , but she knows he 's sitting there to watch her as she walks around the backyard . His eyes are half closed as he looks at her . His legs are open ; he lets his hands , one holding a cigarette , dangle between his knees . Something about his looking at her makes her feel he 's locked her in somewhere . She keeps walking around , not ever getting closer to him , but not wanting him to stop looking at her either . The circles she makes are getting smaller . It 's making her dizzy to keep walking around like that . But she ca n't stop . She turns her back to him and stares at one of the hydrangea bushes . She hates those flowers . She does n't know why anyone would want flowers like that . She lifts the front of her shirt to wipe the sweat off her face . She knows he can probably see her . She 's sick of it , she wants to take a shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting . She loves her shower at home . Her own shower in her own bathroom : white tiles , chrome , as much hot water as she wants any time , coming out of the shiny metal shower head . This one is greenish on the bottom , where the holes are that the water shoots from . She likes the water in the Hobbs pool : bluish , sharp , like it was never near anything dirty . No one ever uses this shower ; her father said thatp204when he lived here he was the only one in the house that ever did . That 's exactly the kind of thing he 's always saying . So that you have to think of him in the shower , and his grandparents taking baths . That 's the kind of thing he 's always making you think about . She does n't look at John as she walks by him to get into the house . She can walk through the house the back way , through the kitchen , which is empty , and up the stairs , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . She ca n't stand that the floor is old linolem , not tiles or a rug or anything like an ordinary bathroom . She goes over to the window to close the curtain . Then she sees that he 's up on a ladder , forty feet away , right across from her , pretending to fix the gutter on the garage , pretending to nail something tight , but she knows it 's not that , she knows he 's there to look at her . If he sees her closing the curtain , he 'll know she did it because of him . And she wo n't let him have that . She walks away from the window , leaving the curtain open . All the time she 's taking off her clothes , she 's telling herself that he 's not making her do anything . She gets into the shower . She can smell the dust in the water ; even the water does n't seem clean .

She soaps herself as slowly as she can , but it starts to bore her . She takes the towel off the rack and begins to dry herself . She makes sure she does it the way she always would , no special way for him . She bends down and shakes her hair out , then wraps a towel around her wet hair . She reaches for another towel , then walks to the window , stands there for a second and wraps the towel around herself . She stands there staring at him so he knowsp205she knows . She tries to make him get down off the ladder , I she ca n't . She pulls the curtains shut . CAM IS ON THE FRONT PORCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and sits beside her .

"  |p206MAGDALENE  IS IN HER ROOM , WONDERING WHAT SHE'LLdo . She is still focused on what she 'll wear , as if , after finding the perfect outfit , she 'll be fine . Her life is largely the body 's , more particularly the eye 's . It 's not that she 's observant ; she has always missed the most obvious , the grossest or most clearly impressive aspect of any scene . Even her interest in clothes is limited largely to those she wears herself . She walks into her closet , a small purple room . A sense of peace comes over her at the abundance of her clothes . She does n't get rid of clothes once they 've gone out of fashion . She pretends that this is done from thrift  --  things always come back , she says , and then you 're glad you have them . But actually it 's that she ca n't bear to betray her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives . How could she put them out , expose them in their old age , in their marginality , to the cruel world whose cruelty they kept her from ? She gave her clothes the tenderness she never gave a lover . Her clothes had given her something : her clothes had added to what she was . But sex only took away . She would gladly have kept herself a virgin had there been a way for her to do it and still leave the family house . Every act of sex to her was an ablation and a loss , total because it took place in private , and she could gain no recognition for what she had given up . But she had to marry to leave the house . And she had to leave the house . Magdalene 's bad luck was to have been born into a family , the one , perhaps , in fifteen hundred , where good looks would n't matter enough to see a daughter through . What could Ellen MacNamara treasure in a pretty girl ? To Ellen , prettiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distraction . And to Vincent , who wasp207by nature genuinely intellectual and moral , and by habit practical and interested in the functions of things , his daughter 's looks were merely a confusion . Her prettiness , soft , blonde , white-skinned , and prone to change , seemed insubstantial to him . He could n't understand why she did n't look like her mother ; he 'd expected her to . Ellen 's was the kind of beauty that he liked , suggesting action or resistance . But Magdalene was n't like that ; she was the ideal of her age : light , curly-haired , with wide perplexed or indolentblue eyes , a pliant , uncomprehending mouth . She was not her father 's type . Finding her vague , scattered , easily distracted , he turned his attention to the other two children , Theresa and John , whom he found solid , who were able to follow an argument , a plan , a blueprint , the directions on a box , the line of a journey on a map . When he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd stuck his hand into a pile of feathers . He could n't fully love that which he could n't grasp . The soft and shifting substance which he believed made up his daughter 's inner nature caused him to recoil . Magdalene knew she did n't please her father , and she was confused , for she could see she pleased all other men . Her failure with her father turned her radically outward . To live her life at home was to acknowledge that she failed . The words , the gestures that made her mother call her a fool and made her father turn away brought her in the outside world friends , laughter , the place of the chosen child . By the time she was eight years old teachers had marked her in this way : Magdalene is sweet-natured and amusing ; she will cause no trouble ; her sunny disposition is an asset in the class . On her , these words meant , no effort would be expended . She would marry early ; there was not much that she need learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel prized , perhaps she would n't have married quite so early . Eighteen . A week after her high-school graduation . Perhaps she would n't have been so obviouslyfoolish in her selection . Was it that her tastes and fantasies , bred in the movies , were bound to mislead her ? They did notp208suggest a recondite , surprising choice . She was the prettiest girl in the class ; she married the best athlete . Who could have predicted it would come to such grief ? Magdalene married Jimmy Laughlin in July of 1938 . From the beginning sex was bad . The problem was one of misinformation , a sexual education so incomplete that Magdalene believed , and still believes , that her husband was fiendish when in fact he had the ordinary hungers of a young and healthy man . She was shocked by the transition from kissing to intercourse . Or it was the lack of transition that shocked her . The unrushed , silent embracesthat were all she had allowed before her wedding turned into a frantic , feverish performance while she lay inert beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , his body were all unfamiliar . He became , she felt , possessed , and she herself entrapped beneath a stranger . He did well enough in his job selling iceboxes so that they could afford , as so few of her friends could , not to live in their parents ' home , but to be independent . Independence is better than a college degree , Jimmy would say , as if he had been tempted for even a minute by the prospect of further education . Living in three rooms above a butcher shop , they felt successful . They felt too that , in living as they did , they had moved one step closer to the America they saw in the movies and had known nowhere in their own lives . In this spirit they decided they would wait to have children . Defying the pastor , Magdalene lied in confession ( later she would see what happened as a punishment for this ) , they used condoms for a year and a half , then gave them up when Magdalene turned twenty-one . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the child . Their sex life , which had been for him the swift release of some uncomprehended pressure and for her a bafflement , turned into the grim , purposeful friction of two people who felt they must overcome a curse . In 1941 they had Camille , named by Magdalene after her favorite movie . Before Camille 's birth , Magdalene had worked as a beauticianp209in Mr. John 's House of Beauty , a salon owned by John Impanata , who had begun his working life a barber and switched , in the twenties , to the newly profitable female clientele . Magdalene 's working life had given her the time and money to build a wardrobe , learn to use makeup , find and maintain the perfect hairdo that would make her not just a natural beauty , but an invented one . With her cork-soled shoes , her Marlene Dietrich trousers , her high-maintenance pompadoured hair , she frightened and made humble the young mothers on the street . She made it appear that Camille 's birth was a subtle , highly styled event in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , were victimsof . In the pictures Jimmy Laughlin took of those days , Camille , a smiling , photogenic baby , radiates her parents ' well-toned pleasure . Her mother in shorts and a midriff top lifts Cam , incandescentlylaughing for Daddy-Papa-look-at-Daddy in the camera . Or muscular , smiling Jimmy holds his treasure like a basketball . In these pictures it is summer , always clement weather . It is also 1941 , but to look at the photographs , you would imagine that the War in Europe was a bad joke that the pessimists made up to stifle the good times of the fun-loving and clean-limbed Americans at home , who obviously knew the score . But then it was March 1942 , and Jimmy was drafted . All the noble , sentimental feelings Magdalene saw in movies actually grew up in her breast . She thought her husband looked heroic in a uniform , though even this sight did n't transform itself into desire . Photogenically , they parted at the railroad station , holding between them their adorable child . When Jimmy spoke to Magdalenesentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this , " his words lacked conviction . He believed himself immortal , and she knew it and resented it , wanting him to throw himself upon her in real , if only temporary fear . During the eight months that Jimmy fought in Burma , Magdalenewent back to work as a beautician . John Impanata sold Magdalene Mr. John 's House of Beauty , which she rechristenedp210Maison Magdalene . Having seen her behavior , knowing her nature , people predicted ruin , chaos , joked about disasters , scenes of Magdalene begging bank managers for a reprieve in a tableau of flutterheaded supplication and distress . But Magdalene made money . It turned out that she had a gift for money . She was excellent at managing her business , hired two more girls , Betty and Myrna , who did manicures as well . When Jimmy came back , he observed Magdalene 's achievement with the pride of a dog owner who has left home and returned to find his pet performing in a circus , wearing a crinoline , a sailor 's outfit , a beret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit now , stay home full-time now he was back , take care of their miracle daughter . She did not . She went on , facing her husband 's anger and his scorn , leaving her daughter with her mother . Ellen felt a satisfaction in her daughter 's making money , it was the one thing she could like her daughter for , and she fell in love with the girl child in whose baby eyes she saw what she had not seen in her daughter 's : something of herself . So , every morning , dressed in stockings and high heels , while the other mothers slopped in housedresses and slippers , her clothes crisp , exciting to her daughter , Magdalene got into her blue-gray Buick , pressed her high-arched , polished shoe on the accelerator , dropped her daughter at Ellen 's , said no to coffee , she was busy , she was rushed , the child had dawdled . But the truth was that she did n't want to be detained for a second longer than need be in the domestic world her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put her key into the lock of the shop , smelt in the dark the strong , dangerous smell of permanent-wave lotion , stood alone and turned the light on with a sense of awe . Seeing it then  --  the empty chairs , the sinks , the dryers , the trays of nail polish and emery boards  --  she thought every morning : I own this , this is mine . Jimmy had to understand that his wife was well off . The baffled look with which she had , before he 'd left , greeted everything from the male orgasm to the size of the telephone bill hadp211smoothed itself out . He could see she wore that look now when it could be useful to her . It could help her get something from a man . But he watched her sitting over the salon 's books and he saw the secure , serene face of a mystic . She seemed to have nothing to do now with domestic life , that dream he and his friends had dreamed together in the Burmese jungle . She would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She simply indicated that they would be eating dinner at her mother 's , and if he wanted a hot meal he should turn up there . He could see that he was of no interest to her , except to be beside her with the other young couples , and to be her partner in the fox-trot or at bridge . Whereas she had been abashed before him sexually , she was indifferent now . He felt she humored him . He saw that she regarded sex as the childish preoccupation of the childish gender , the male . The men whom she admired , like her father , she believed had reached maturity and given it all up . Magdalene was right to see her husband a boy . Defeated by his wife 's prosperity without him , he grew every month more into the child she thought him to be . He tried to pick up the thread of his pre-war success , the shining high-school years when he courted Magdalene , impressed and won her . It was embarrassing to see him with the teenagers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogging the ball and showing off . He trained his daughter to be an athlete . Flattered by her status as the chosen girl , proficient in the world of males , delightedly Cam let herself be tutored in sports that were her father 's calling and his pride . She became a girlfriend to her mother ; she became her father 's pal . All this was established before she was six years old . Her two good-looking parents knew they had more to say to her than they did to each other . She assumed that was the way with all parents . She was close to no children but Dan , who had no parents , and she had no way to verify what she simply took to be the norm . Then the news , the policeman at the door at 3:00 A. M. Jimmy Laughlin was dead , drunk , off the highway with a parish girl.  |p212Eighteen  years old and dead too , drunk like him . Because of Jimmy , her heartbroken parents took up in the town the honorable position of the shamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Betrayal gave her stature . She became the movie image of the gallant widow , prematurely middle-aged . Without comment , offering no one an explanation ( none was needed ) , she gave up her husband 's name and changed her own name and her daughter 's , legally , to MacNamara . In fact , she 'd loved her name , loved the alliteration , " Magdalene MacNamara . " She had thought it distinguished ; now she thought it would be good for trade . Camille saw that her mother did not mourn , and closed part of her heart against her . One room she kept cleansed and sanctified for the handsome young man who had pretended , all along pretended , to have been her father , and now , dead , seemed in fact to be . She clung to Dan , who had always been the one child she 'd enjoyed . She clung to her grandparents . Thinking of all this makes Magdalene feel trapped . She feels her clothes have conspired against her . Punishingly , she pulls the string on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the size of a room . The string sways back and forth ; the little metal flower at the string 's end clanks against the bulb like a lost soul . She feels she has nowhere to go . Nothing is of interest to her . She thinks angrily of her daughter . How could she be a happy woman with a daughter who 's always treated her the way Cam has ? She feels like she needs to calm down . She decides to pour herself a drink . It 's Cam 's fault that she 's drinking at this hour . Thinking of her daughter 's defections , beginning at Jimmy 's death , makes her feel that her nerves poke through her skin and she needs something to put them back , take them away from the surface , where they are too susceptible to hurt . She pours herself a drink . Sherry , she thinks , will be a nice drink , a light drink for this hour of the morning . Magdalene begins to drink . Whenever Magdalene admits shep213drinks ( which is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is alone ) she tells herself that she does it because her daughter always wanted to make her feel bad . She was so upset at that time , after her husband died , that she could n't sleep . If Camille had just been nice to her then , it would have made all the difference . But Camille turning against her kept her up at night . She would n't even let Magdalene put her to bed ; she would n't let Magdalene unbraid and brush her hair . " That 's OK , Mom , I can do it . You 're tired . " But she was n't tired . When she lay down all kinds of things came into her head , things it was n't any help to think about . Somebody suggested she take sleeping pills . But when she asked Larry Riordan , the doctor , he said , " I 'd hate to see you getting caught up in dope . Just have yourself a good stiff drink , that 'll bring sleep on you . " Camille did everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she spent all the time she could with her grandparents . On Saturdays , she did n't wake Magdalene up in the morning , she dressed herself and walked to her grandparents ' for breakfast . " Why did n't you wake me , I told you I 'd take you to the luncheonette for breakfast ? We talked about it last night , you said you 'd get French toast . " " You looked tired , Mama . I wanted to let you sleep . " Sometimes she could catch her daughter off her guard by makingsome warm , female nest , not womanly , but girlish : a lush refuge where two equals could retreat and settle . The two of them could sit on Magdalene 's bed with its varieties of pillows and watch the Late Show and eat foods of great comfort and pleasure with no nutritive value at all . Modern foods Ellen would never serve . She could take her daughter out to lunch . For a while , they could go shopping . But as Cam grew older , she took on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a restaurant , " she 'd tell her mother . Or : " Let 's not go shopping , I do n't need more clothes . " More and more , Magdalene was pushed out of the life her daughter lived by day . Vincent worked with Camille on her homework ; he made her and Dan the stars in the schoolp214science projects , coached them for spelling bees , and drove them anywhere for oratorical competitions which they nearly always won . With her grandmother , Camille talked politics . Together they campaigned for Stevenson , together they cursed  --  the real untrammeled curses Ellen encouraged in her granddaughter  --  they cursed the fools who voted for a mediocre bald golfer when they could have had such an obviously great man for President . Magdalene thought Camille despised her . Camille was always trying to make her look bad , to punish her . For what ? She 'd worked hard , worked her fingers to the bone , to get the best for her daughter . She did n't know what else Camille wanted . What else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be enough . You 'd never satisfy Camille . She never understood what Magdalene had been through , what she had to go through every day of her life . Even now , forty-four years old , she does n't have the maturity to understand her mother . Even today , she wants to put her through it . Does n't she understand how hard it would be for Magdalene to go to her parents ' house ? In this weather , with this humidity and her trouble breathing ? It 's like she does n't know a thing about Magdalene 's health , after everything the doctorstold her . She does n't see how she can be expected to do the things Camille expects her to do . Her hands start shaking just thinking of getting dressed and going out . Suppose she fainted on the street . When she gets shaky like this , anything can happen . Another drink will steady her . Maybe , she thinks , with another one she 'll be steady enough to get herself dressed and go outside . The sherry bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she keeps unopened liquor . The lower cabinet , violet enamel , with its white scalloped trim . Sherry is a light drink for the morning . Soothing . She pours herself another half-glass and sits down on the purple chaise longue . It is twenty years after Magdalene 's first sickness , twenty years after her operation , which was a complete success . She is in herp215room now , August 14 , 1985 , knowing they are waiting for her , her family , knowing they think she wo n't show up . It would please some of them if she should fail her father : Theresa , Sheilah would be pleased . Dan would sympathize with her but he would sympathize more with Cam . Her mother wo n't notice . Her mother does n't notice anything anymore . She would n't recognize Magdalene even if she came . John would n't notice ; Marilyn would be kind either way . Her father would understand . Nobody 's like her father . She knows he 'll understand . It 's Cam , Cam 's the one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that Cam believes that if she shows up they 've proved they 're all right , the two of them , and if she does n't they 're shamed . She does n't want to go . She 's full of dread . She blames her daughter for this dread . Why does her daughter make her feel these things ? Nobody else has daughters that make them feel these things , these terrible upsetting things Cam makes her feel . Someoneshould know about Cam , the way she really is . She wants to tell someone , about everything Cam does to her . Cam never understands . Cam 's never on her side . She needs to call someone . She decides to call her father . She has the number , somewhere ; though she 's never called him at that home . She fishes in her drawer for her telephone book . The number is there , written in Cam 's hand . The problem is that she 's never confided in him . He has n't understood because she 's been afraid to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to know . He 's got to know the score , the way things are .

" I 'm hoping to see you later , Pop , at the house . " " Well , that would be nice , " he says but she can tell that he does n't believe her . She has n't been in the house for fifteen years , but that does n't mean anything . If she says she 's going to come , he should believe she 'll come.  | " It 's only that the heat is terrible , and the humidity . I feel so dizzy in this kind of weather .

" It 's twenty years , Pop , that I 've had to live with this . A death sentence for twenty years . I never said this to you , Pop , but it 's the truth . I looked into the face of death . Do you know what that 's like ? " Her father does n't say anything . " Every day of my life I have to face the fact that I could die . " " It 's true of all of us , Magdalene , " he says . This makes her angry . " You never looked into the face of death , " she says . " None of you know what it 's like . Especially Camille . She has no sympathy for me . She just tries to make me look in the wrong . " " That 's not true , Magdalene . She 's very good to you . " " That 's my cross , Pop . That 's what you think , that 's what everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Always wanting to make me look in the wrong . " " Well , I do n't know about that , Magdalene . I think I 'd better finish packing . You take care of yourself . " " You too , Pop . Maybe I 'll see you later . " " Fine , " he says . She knows that he does n't believe her . None of them knows what it 's like . " I 've looked into the face of death , " she says , aloud , to no one . The worst thing about it she does n't say , that she looked into the face of death , and she prepared herself , submitted herself , not just to having her breasts cut off , but to the thought of death , which she awaited like a just and longed-for punishment . But then it did n't come , and the failure of the sentence she had believed in made her see death as untrustworthy . That was the worst . It could be anywhere , and could appear at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alone in her room , Magdalene imagines her daughter in Vin/cent and Ellen 's house . She knows what Cam is thinking . She knows the words behind the thoughts . Hearing the words makes her angry . Her anger has no lightness ; it weighs down her limbs . Could she walk anywhere with legs like these ? Her legs are like lead . The lead rises up her legs , it fills her ribs . Her ribs are leaden straps around her lungs . How can she breathe ? She sees herself on the street . There is no self there , no shape , nothing to keep her from spilling over into air , into life , into anybody 's life . Outsidethis room she can fly off , she will , there will be no more her , nothing will press down on her to create a shape . The room creates the shape . Outside the room , everything will be lost .

I ca n't leave this room . She ca n't possibly be expected to go outside . How can she , when she is as she is , when she ca n't be looked at , when she can fall apart ? The space where her breasts were throbs like a burn . She is loathsome ; she is mutilated . Her body , hacked so it must be hidden , is the true sign of herself . She has to hide .

She decides that she 'll stay here , in her room . Nothing is that important . No one cares enough.  |p221VINCENT  IS SITTING IN A ROOM THAT PLEASES HIM AS MUCHas any he has lived in . He is packing up his things . In hisshaving kit he puts his razor , shaving brush and soap , an orange tin of foot powder , a cake of soap ( Cashmere Bouquet ) which he has rewrapped in its original paper . He folds the cotton rug that lies beside his bed . Sheilah his granddaughter brought it to him from Mexico , where she went once on vacation . There are pink , turquoise , and scarlet animals cavorting among branches . Their paws and haunches intertwine . He has never liked the rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheilah , who 'd never had the knack for pleasing . When Cam visited , her eye would fall down to the rug . Vincent could see Cam weighing the two possibilities : Perhaps he likes the rug , I must n't spoil it for him ; or he 's doing this for Sheilah to be nice . When Sheilah visited , she always said , " It really livens up the place . " Under those words , though , he could hear what she was saying : " I have traveled . I have given you something the others never would have thought of . Now let me be first . "  |p222Able  to hear the words below the words , how could Vincent take up the rug , which he dislikes ? Even when she was gone and would not be back for a month , how could he ? It hurts his eye . The room is square and plain and institutional . This is why he likes it . Sister Otile and Sister Roberta covered the decaying wooden floors with squares of tannish vinyl tile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deranged plaster . They took a house that was the ruin of great beauty and made a place where people could be comfortable and live their lives . He honors them for this , and for their labor , whose full scope he knows . At the same time he honors the house for its loss , as you would honor a woman , formerly beautiful , who has lost her money and been forced to take a useful job . Without the rug , the room was only what it was : a place where people could enter and collect themselves . The room would disappeararound them . What they made of their lives was theirs ; the room would never help or stop them . Vincent likes this state of things , he likes its possibilities . His friends had come into this room and sat and talked and smoked their cigarettes . They had played cards , traded magazines , shared the advice and homemade things the families brought . They did n't admit that it was pleasant when their families left again , and they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , where no one looked at them with the heavy eyes that said , " I have abandoned you . Forgive me . " Vincent is grateful to have had a room where people could come and enjoy themselves . Now he is leaving . But he does n't want to leave . They have done everything so he can go back home . He ca n't tell them that he wants to stay here ; he ca n't disappoint them . He 's been a man who did n't disappoint . At this age , you could only finish the life you 'd led , and be the person you had been . Otile Ryan , Sister Otile , he ca n't help but call her , thinks it is n't so . She believes in change . They all do , all the sisters . On Sister Roberta 's desk is a framed card , the message written in the slant , well-known handwriting of someone who had been a nun , but had got famous and had left the convent . " Today is the firstp223day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For these last months , he 's believed them . He thinks of Ellen now . Sitting in her chair , up out of bed an hour , two hours a day , muttering curses , cursing offenders for their seventy-year-old crimes . Nothing is forgotten . Now her heart and brain have grown gelatinous , transparent . You can see the old slights , the offenses , come together and the punishments beside them . It is as if you could see them when you saw her eyes . Neither of them had believed much in change . You are who you are , they 'd always said . But were you ? Who was Ellen now ? He had to admit , she 's changed . But has her change changed him ? Does it mean he is n't the person he has been ? Who , then , is he ? He remembers a road in Ireland : white ; flat ; and walking on it in hard boots . His heart was hardened against his wife . But then his hardness left him . He became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd thought that after that he would never again not know her , since she was a person he had , for a moment , been . He 'd thought it was a thing you would n't lose . He 'd lost it now . Nothing more would change for Ellen . Or only one thing : she would die . The biggest change for him had happened when he 'd left his home in Dromnia for Cork City , thirty miles away . He lost his home . If he told the truth , that was the biggest thing that ever happened to him ; bigger than losing his son in the War . Bigger than meeting Ellen ? Maybe . Yes . Even leaving for the other side , crossing the ocean to America , was n't as hard as the day he left home to be apprentice to O'Donovan , the ironworker who 'd learned from Leary at the mill in Dromnia that Vincent had a talent with his hands . He had n't wanted to leave home . Except he knew his older brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . He did n't want it to be his place for good.  |p224Terrible  , the way it was in families . He 'd never understood it . Why they were n't what they were meant to be , what they could almost be so easily . Children grew up there , little children , and were never difficult . The faces of children come before him now , parades of them , Julia and Margaret , his two younger sisters whom he 'd barely known , dead now , both of them . Julia in the blitz of London , where she 'd worked as a trained nurse . She 'd been the one who had been sensible , though it was Margaret that he 'd preferred , in trouble all the time for giggling at nothing , but she was affectionate , warm in her preferences , and candid . She 'd married a farmer , a boy from a nearby town he 'd never met , and died a mile from home at fifty-six , of a ruptured appendix . In America she would have lived . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . They liked their home ; they had no wish to leave it . Then his own two girls . Magdalene , never sure what was her place or if there was even a place for her . Her prettiness gone to her head , or maybe not : she 'd been unhappy . He 'd always felt he had nothing to say to her . Their conversations flooded up and then evaporated , senseless , and with nothing left behind . He preferred Theresa . Even her looks were preferable to him . Had she ever loved him ? She was religious now , the only one of them so pious . Probably to spite her mother . She said , " I thank God every day for the gift of the faith you gave us all in spite of Mother . " He 'd liked Ellen 's derision of the faith , though he himself had been devout , not knowing why . It had seemed right to be . He could see Theresa now , her head bent over some acquisition . She liked collecting , then discarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleaning where she had just cleaned , reproachful . Ellen would turn on her : " If you 'd an idea in your head , or an interest worth a shilling in the world , you would n't have the time to be behind me with a dustcloth . " When Ellen sat down to read something , Theresa would destroy her peace in it . She knew how to torment her mother , it gave her pleasure to torment.  |p225Vincent  knew why . Her mother had felt nothing for her , nothing for either of the girls . The son alone was her treasure . Of course the girls were upset by it . Yes , of course . He used to think they could all stop it if they wanted . They could all say : " Now we will love each other . And our unhappiness will end . " As he grew older , he thought he 'd been wrong . In his own home , in the town of Dromnia in County Cork , there had been hate . Even now , an eighty-eight-year-old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am weak , a child , there is nothing I can keep back . His brother always meant him harm . And why ? Because the mother had loved Vincent best . And because the father would n't listen to the older brother 's thoughts about the farm . ( It was the brother who was right . When the old man died it was the brother who made money . The brother died a bachelor with the richest herd for miles . ) When they were boys , the brother did him damage . Little cruelties , abandonments , exposures to the world from which he needed , as a younger child , some shielding . Older , the brother used his strength to hurt . He need not have . But why think that way ? He was born as he was . He remembers them on the road to school , his terror of his older brother 's strength . His pride in it . They 'd once raised together a lamb whose mother had jumped off the rocks to her death . They 'd found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff above . Each morning Vincent and the brother , friends for once , came out to nurse the lamb . Secretly , knowing the father 'd think it soft . Bluebell , they called her , cradling her . They 'd even sing , some song of their mother 's to calm down a baby . Then one day the thing was done , the father never mentioned it . It was n't the father 's idea . After all the years of thinking the thing over , Vincent was sure of it . ( Did other people do this to their lives ? Go over them like this , nothing changing in the details of it , the picture coming out the same , it had to , of course . Over and over he 'd shuffled the things that hadp226happened , as he shuffled cards the slow way that made Ellen so impatient when they played . As if it was n't worth it . Still , he kept it up . He felt he owed the past that much , at least to go over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the past , she recombined it , in false ways that shocked him . Colorful new ways , any way she liked , as if the things that happened were just furniture , you changed this or moved that . Then you were satisfied . ) He 'd tried to make himself think , when the thing first happened , that the brother 'd done it because he thought it was the father 's wish . But what he knew , had always known , was that the brother did it for the pleasure of it , because he 'd liked to hurt . Vincent had come home late from school . He 'd received special praise from Mr. Boyle , the schoolmaster , on his sums . That was what had set the brother off . He 'd walked up the road , his heart singing with the praise he 'd got from Mr. Boyle . ( Who 'd later been murdered by the Black and Tans . No one had known he 'd been political . He was stalwart and taciturn until his rage flared up when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had mattered to him that the children learn . " D'ye think in the Midlandsof England there are boys full of dumb insolence like you lot ? " he would say . ) Mr. Boyle had given Vincent a book of Irish poems . " To VincentMacNamara . For proficiency in Mathematics , " he had written on the flyleaf . And Vincent had shown his brother . And the brother had done that thing . " It 's done , then , " the brother had said , staring at Vincent to show he had nothing in his mind to be ashamed of . " I saw no sense in waiting for you . Who knew when he 'd let you out ? " He pointed to the place behind the house where he had done it . The dead animal , his throat open , red and revealing where the knife had gone in . The fresh blood oozing into the wool . He must have waited till he 'd seen Vincent coming to begin it . Must have stood up on the rise and waited . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb would have come out to him , thinking it was milk he carried . He 'd have taken the lamb on his lap , as they'dp227always done to feed him , and then taken out the knife and done the thing . While Vincent looked down at the animal 's body , he knew everything . The first thing he took in with calm ; it was simple : the animal was dead . The second made him frightened : he could see the remnants of life still within the animal . What happened had just happened . The third thing he knew made fear and anger grow inside his brain , like trees that grow from the same root beside each other , harmful and competitive , yet bound . His brother had done this to harm him . It was Vincent 's throat , not the poor animal 's , he would have liked to cut . He should have struck the brother . But he was a child . Tears blubbered up . Shameful and undistinguished tears , fat tears that dripped , and his nose running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing in him was to the purpose ; nothing in him could punish or revenge . His weakness was the truest thing about him . It was the only thing . And then the mother came , saying she 'd heard the screaming ( he must have screamed , although he had no knowledge of it ) , his mother walking with the baby , walking to the back of the house , where they stood , crying out : " In the name of God , what happened ? " He could only run to her , out of his formlessness . His shame made him the shape he was : legs without sinews , body without shoulders , boneless feet infantile as his sister 's , still a suckling . He 'd let himself be taken on his mother 's lap , because he lacked the shape and force to stop it . He let the mother cradle him , knowing that for his age the place that he was in was shameful . " What else ? " the brother cried . " Run to your mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem about it . Sell it to the newspaper . For myself , I 'll savor every bite of the meals the animal makes , and so will all this family if they 're honest . As if we could afford the cost of feeding it . Strapped as we are . " He threw the knife down . The point of it stuck in the dirt . " Pick that up , now , " their mother said , but Vincent could hearp228the fear inside her anger and he knew the brother never would pick it up . The father had whipped the boy , but he 'd not repented . And there had n't been a soft word spoken between Vincent and his brother from that time until the last day they saw each other , the day that Vincent went off to America knowing that his brother would always be happy only at his harm . He 'd been right to go to Cork , and it was shocking to remember how quickly the pain of leaving home had passed . In some ways it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to leave there ? Blind ambition . He remembered Father Sullivan warning of it from the pulpit , how it was the curse of Irish life . The countryside stripped of its youth by the ambition that considered only self . He spoke of emigrants , " the type , of course , who left their homeland for selfish , materialistic reasons , not carrying with them one single reminder of their nationality , not a shamrock , not a ribbon , as if they were casting off all allegiance to the motherland . " He told a tale about a priest friend of his who 'd come back from America . He 'd walked one night , fresh from the bed of a dying child , to see a woman of ill repute walking behind him . Intoxicated , flaunting herself in the most lascivious manner , withoutthe shame , even , to conceal her intent from a priest . He turned round to warn her sharply of the jeopardy in which she was placing her immortal soul and the immortal souls of others . To his horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a girl from his own town in Kerry , who had been the treasured playmate of his youth . She wept , recognizing her old friend . Thank God he 'd been able to talk her into returning home , and she worked now in Killarney , a respectable and happy seamstress , able to put the horrors of America behind her in the clean and bracing air of Erin , her true home . Ask that Eileen about the streets they pave with gold , the priest had thundered , bringing down his fist hard on the pulpit wood . And she will tell you not the honeyed lies ofp229lucre-loving wretches whose great fortunes have been made by the foolish credibility of the young who can not wait to leave their homes . Vincent is an old man , sitting in a room thousands of miles away from Cork . Father Sullivan is dead , must have been dead for fifty years . Still , his voice is alive in Vincent 's ear . Yet he wonders : could that have been a true story , the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dying child , just running into his old playmate in the way it had been told ? He does n't like to think a priest would lie just for effect , but maybe it was what they called poetic license . On the other hand , stranger coincidences had happened in the world . The words of Father Sullivan still make him afraid . The loss of faith , of virtue and of health , the ruin , mental , physical , and spiritual , the coarsening of every humanfeeling , and the break of every human tie  --  that none of it had come to pass was , is nothing to Vincent now . He can hear in his skull once again the words , the hard words , the important words " apostasy , " " damnation , " " treachery , " " the bone and sinew of the Irish nation brutally cut out . " He 'd sat in the church in Cork , trying the words out on himself : " traitor , " " apostate , " " lucre-loving materialist . " He feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At night , in his bed in Mrs. Tierney 's house in the Barrack Stream , he tried them on as well . Suppose he was not yet any one of these things now but could become them ? He might not notice it happening . He might have lost his soul , have lost it without knowing . Fortunately , he confessed his fears to Father Lavery , the confessorto the Pioneers . " Vincent , " the priest had told him in the darkness of the sacrament , " if I were a young man I 'd be on the boat beside you . " Great fellows they were , the Pioneers . Great times he 'd had in that huge room above the drapers ' , not a bit less enjoyable because of lack of spirits , never mind what the detractors said . The Pioneer Total Abstinence Society , a group with high ideals , considered that liquor was the ruination of the sap and flower of Irish man/hood . Why did the Irish take to drink ? It was an interesting questionto Vincent , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His daughter , too , he 'd never wanted to admit that Magdalene had that problem . Now he feels he must . He must begin to tell the truth about the midnight phone calls to her mother . Years ago they started . Cam was still a child . Magdalene would phone and berate Ellen , saying she had never loved her , neither of them had . He knew she said it , though she never spoke to him in those states , and Ellen and he were silent when she hung up the phone . It was her mother she abused . She was n't right ; it was n't that he had n't loved her , it was that he did n't know what to do with her . A pretty girl who could n't hold a thing two minutes in her head . Wanting to dress up , going in for playing parts . Nothing to do with me , he 'd said , looking at his daughter , unable to get his mind fastened on the kind of person that she was . Unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could put her mind to that . It was a terrible thing for a mother to drink . He 'd seen Cam coming to them in the mornings , saying nothing about what her mother had done . Coming to Ellen to be given breakfast . Ellen and Vincent had admired her . They 'd felt real admiration for the child . They did n't have to say anything to each other about their feelings for Cam ; each watched how the other behaved . She was the only girl child Ellen ever liked , and you saw why : Cam 's heart was loyal and she did n't ask for help . She wanted to be around you but there was no needing things from you . You 'd take your hat off to a kid like that Dan , too , the two of them , looking after each other . Brother and sister never closer . It had surprised him that his children had n't liked each other . Though it should n't have : he and his brother had n't liked each other . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been right to , right to go to Cork , a green boy , fifteen years of age , apprenticing himself first to the ironworkers Smith and Pearsons , Ltd . He 'd taken up the offer that Mr. Leary , whop231ran the mill in Dromnia , had let him know about . He had a great friend in Cork City , he 'd told Vincent , who had a great place for a boy with a fine mechanical sense , like himself . As a young child he 'd found his way over to the mill . He 'd been drawn to it . He passed it on the way to school , when he took the walk he liked , beside the river . The sound of the mill wheel fascinated him , and , timid as he was , he had approached it . The machinery had made him dreamy . He remembered now the first time it had happened , how he 'd lost himself  --  in the intricacies of the machine . The gears , the axle : he mooned over them as poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix his eye , and then be lost . No Vincent , no more body , no mind trying to get around the coiling and incomprehensible ways people acted , what they thought , their hates , despairs , their cruelties . Mr. Flannery , the manager , who worked in the mill office , was a Protestant . Vincent had taken his fancy . A stern , fastidious bachelor , with pencils showing from the pocket of his old tweed jacket , he had a reputation among the men who worked at the mill for being gruff but fair . The men respected him . Vincent had decided as a child that that was his desire : to be admired for his justice , for his knowledge , by men who worked under him . Only he knew he did n't want to sit behind the desk ; he 'd want to be there with the other men . With the machinery . He 'd left school at thirteen to work at the mill , because he knew it was the life for him , the life he liked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , rarely speaking , but the silence functional , not ominous like the long silences between him and his brother which hung in the air between them like rows of hooks . The men would say to each other , " Would you pass me that ? " or " Could you hold that for me ? " or sometimes no need even to say it , for you knew , you were caught up in it , what it was you were to do , what help of yours was needed . When something went wrong with the machinery , you felt like a circle of fathers standing still above the sleeping or the ailing child.  |p232Machines  brought up in him a painful tenderness . He felt , always , that they were trying . He could help them in their failures . Their failures were not their fault . Jack Lafferty , the mill attendant , had been kind to him as well . Vincent had often thought Jack Lafferty must have considered him an odd one . Eight years , nine years old , and standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was water in the desert , or the most gorgeous woman in the world . He 'd talk to Jack about the workings of it . One day Jack let him watch when the stone stopped dead in its turning and he had to prize the floorboards up to check the gears and find the problem . Come with me , then , he had said , and Vincent followed , stepping carefully and watching , watching , for at his first look he knew he understood the thing and longed to get his hands on it . He liked how the time went . It was the end of the day before you knew it . He 'd not minded being indoors in the finest weather , even , which surprised him : he 'd loved his walks out by the river and the caring for the animals . But he had left that , once and for all , and left off schooling when he was just thirteen years old . He was happy he had found his place . The father had been glad of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning what he would n't say : Remember that the land is going to the older brother . None of this is yours . The mother had regretted it , taken to heart the lamentations of the teacher , who 'd said Vincent should go on with schooling , for he had the gift . The mother had loved the book of poems he 'd won for his mathematics , loved to have him read out to her the songs of Thomas Moore , like they were poems . In the book it said that Moore had been a friend of Byron , the great English poet . He 'd have been a Protestant , though , Moore , which made it less remarkable that he 'd been friends with a rich Englishman . Terrible among the Irish , Catholics hating Protestants , and the hate back . Even now there was bloodshed because of it . He 'd never taken a position back at home . " Keep out of it , " his mother had warned him as he 'd left for Cork . " Keep out of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villains armed against the other . There 's no hope in it . " He 'd loved his mother and had n't wanted to cause her worry , so he had kept out . She 'd been glad that he 'd joined the Pioneers instead . He was sorry now that he had n't been in the Irish Question . By Easter 1916 , he was in America , but it had been fermentingall the time in Cork . The parties , so confusing and so numerous you could n't keep track . The papers full of it . Confusing . He 'd been confused by the First World War and had n't taken a position . It was before he met Ellen . She 'd taken a position . She 'd been against it . He knew that if they 'd been in Cork together Ellen would have read the papers , holding them close to her nose as if she could find the truth by reading closer . She 'd have been able to make her way . She 'd have been in the thick of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd bring you out into the world . She was a great one for seeing the big picture . " We 're citizens of the world , Vincent , " she 'd say . " We ca n't forget it . " It was one of the first things he remembered her saying to him . So young and fresh and high-colored , her features sharp , her dark hair shining , in her twenties , but she looked much younger to him . He did n't know her real age , that she was older than he was , till they were married . " And if you 'd known , what would you 've done ? " she said , teasing him , playing with his hair . " You 'd have stayed away from the old crone . Just as well for you it never came up . " He let her tease him but it was as well , it was a blessing . If he 'd known that she was older , he 'd never have approached her . He 'd have thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he thought that in her youth he 'd give her some protection that she needed . If he 'd known that she was older , he 'd have felt that he had nothing , not a thing that he could give her that she did n't have herself . He felt if they had met in Cork they 'd have been involved in the Great Struggle . She denied it . She had no interest in the Irish Question . The Irish were bog trotters , she said . They mucked up whatever it was that they touched . Let the English take them allp234in hand and make a decent country of them . What could you expect of them , a rosary in one hand , a pistol in the other , a flask of poteen in the pocket just in case their other remedies should fail them . There was no tenderness in her for her own country . None . But she was wrong about herself . She 'd have seen the injustice of the English and been stirred . Injustice moved her , and her hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of that part of herself for the family , and it was wrong for her , he knows it now , but at the time , what could you do ? What could you do when the times were against you , against who you really were ? For his own mother , family was everything . He 'd been happy with his mother . People did n't seem to have fond memories of their parents anymore . His memories of her were fond . He knew himself her favorite . Perhaps because of the long space between him and the younger girls . For six years she had not conceived . Mysterious . And then she 'd conceived four more times . In those years he was her companion , always with her as she did the woman 's work . She 'd trusted him to gather eggs and help her with the milking . Together they planted the kitchen garden , and in another plot they 'd both felt a bit ashamed of in front of the father and the older brother , they grew flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet peas . Hollyhocks . Ellen had grown those flowers too . Nowadays peopledid n't go in for them so much . They liked these modern flowers with their new sharp colors . Modern plants were what the sisters wanted . " Vincent , " they 'd pleaded , " we want petunias and geraniums . Coleus . " In their blue station wagon they 'd brought home what were called " bedding plants . " It was n't how he liked to do things , or the kind of flowers he liked . But to please them he 'd planted them out . They 'd flourished . And how glad the sisters had been , how grateful . It had made him courtly , manly , their women 's praise , old as he was and even though they themselves were nuns . It had hurt his mother when he went to Cork . But it had beenp235a good thing . It had been for his advancement . Had he been wrong doing things for his advancement ? Had the priest been right , that Father Sullivan , whose voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , materialism ? He was interested , it was true , in the material . Not money . Objects . It was important to him that a thing should be well made . He might , for all that , have stayed on at the mill in Dromnia . But he had left because he could not bear to live beside his brother , having to take in all that hate . His mother had the countrywoman 's belief in the root evil of all cities . Be careful what you eat , they 'll steal your money , do n't speak to a woman , the milk is full of coal dust , take your tea black , look for a picture of the Sacred Heart before you choose your lodgings . What to her was danger had been what stretched out encouraging and beautiful before his eyes . He 'd walked each inch of Cork , the first of his cities . The names came back to him , vivid , exciting names . Patrick Street , the Grand Parade , Anglesea Street , Cool Street , the Vicar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busyness and action of the ships , the goods unloading and the shouting of the workers on the dock . The warehouses for storing butter , tea , silk , parts of carriages , or furniture . Medicines . Soap . All those things manufactured in dark factories , their brick or stone fronts as inviting to him as a home . His first real job after his apprenticeship was in the brick-front headquarters of Capwell Carriage Works , assistant to the smith there , Owen Dawson . A hard man , unhelpful , not wanting to teach the knowledge that he had . He 'd moved from there after consulting Mr. Leary back at the mill in Dromnia , who 'd recommended Owen Dawson and whom he did n't want to disappoint . " Weigh the pros and cons , Vincent , of any decision you make . Weigh them honestly . " Sound advice it had been , and he 'd followed it always , had lived by it . Not Ellen . She 'd make a decision in an instant , she could feel it on her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she 'd do it and she 'd not look back . But had she always been right ? She 'd got the proportions wrong . She 'd framed it badly . Her ideas were right : hold fast ; keep faith , be what you stand for . But she hadn'tp236done it . What she 'd done was to keep people out . She 'd mocked him in the end ; she 'd stopped being who she had been . But he knew that even now she was expecting him to keep his promise : Do n't let me be taken away , do n't let me die among strangers . He had convinced the others that he wanted to go home . So now he 'll go home . He dreads going back , he 's been happy at Maryhurst . But he ca n't say that . At eighty-eight you owed it to people to be the man you always had been , so that they could believe in things and go on . Weigh all the pros and cons . Give equal weight to each . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no will to teach him . The men in the place drank on the sly and muttered constantly against the foreman , who was a time-server and a fool . Vincent realized that only two things kept him there . The first was the twice-weekly visits of Mr. Capwell himself , resplendent in his morning clothes , his spats , his white carnation . The second was the wording of the advertisement in the Cork Examiner which made him proud of his association with the firm : " Capwell CarriageWorks , " it read , Having had a long varied and practical experience in all classes of work , and being thoroughly conversant with the requirementsof the Trade , the public are assured of having their orders Executed in a prompt and satisfactory manner , strict attention being paid to repairs of every description at strictly moderate charges . Trial respectfully submitted . He 'd felt it was an honor to be part of such an organization . He was linked up with serious words again , like the words from the pulpit , " conversant " and " satisfactory " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostasy " or " sins against the Holy Ghost . " As time went on , however , he began to know his worth . Then he began to read with care the other advertisements in the Corkp237Examiner . One day , the first of May it was , the year 1911 , he saw two advertisements by the same firm . The perfection of the wording , fitting as it did his talents , his need for employment , and his preference that the employment should be in a firm of grandeur and of style  --  these came together in the two ads in the paper the same day . The first was an ad to attract potential customers . " Twelve Prize Medals Awarded , " read the headline . " McArdle &; Sons , Carriage Builders , Warren Place , Cork . " Then there was white space , and the eye dropped down . Invite an Inspection of their Carriages , comprising all that is most Modern , Elegant , and Up to Date . They have also a very extensive variety of cars and carriages at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workmen in the South of Ireland , and personally supervises each branch of the Business to give the greatest possible attention to the Materials , and special care being paid , using only what is highly Seasoned , they are thereby enabled to guarantee all their work the expertise of which is attested by the large number of Prize Medals they have received . Prize medals , and the greatest possible attention to materials . He could remember now how he had held the newspaper away from him , then put it down . And then he saw below that advertisement , in another column , the same firm , McArdle &; Sons , had advertised a place . Smith 's Helper wanted at McArdle &; Sons , Carriage Builders , Warren Place , Cork . Must be a sober man . No other need apply . A sober man , no other need apply . He could remember how he 'd folded up the newspaper , completely , perfectly , as he did every day , to be added to the pile beneath his bed in Mrs. Tierney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days ,  |p238stuff  you 'd felt you 'd re-read at your leisure , poetry and essays , Swift and Dante , he 'd read about in the newspaper , and the great Cardinal Wiseman , and all sorts of information about nature . Things he still remembered , like a piece about the fierce cats of Cat Island , near the Cape of Good Hope , animals so ferocious they could be tamed by no man . You did n't get stuff from newspaperslike that nowadays , it was a disappointment . He 'd loved learning all sorts of things about the world . When Cam and Dan were young , he 'd subscribed to National Geographic : the built-up yellow piles of them made him feel prosperous and safe . He still kept his subscription up . He thinks of Mrs. Tierney 's filthy house . Poor soul , a widow , he supposed she 'd tried , but it was still a dreadful place , in the courtyard with the other houses , dismal , and the shouting of the angry mothers , all their patience gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunks at night , berating or apologizing . He 'd been miserable there , but felt too sorry for Mrs. Tierney to move . Perhaps if he 'd had better lodgings , he 'd not have left for New York . That day , in Mrs. Tierney 's house , he unfolded the newspaper and forced his eye to move slowly once again down the advertising columns , to be certain that his eye would read correctly what he feared he 'd only dreamed . But no , he had n't dreamed it . The same words called up to him . He put his cap on , made his way through the dark courtyard to Warren Place , to look for himself at the building that housed McArdle &; Sons . Nothing special on the outside , red brick , a bit of undistinguished ivy climbing up , high windows , desolate at that hour , blue and empty with the workers gone . He 'd wanted some sort of message from the stones themselves , but no message had been forthcoming . The edifice did not proclaim itself superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . He weighed both sides : he had a sure place at Capwell , they knew his worth and he their weakness . But he would never rise there , as he 'd hoped he would . He 'd slept on it ,  |p239and  in the morning he walked back to McArdle 's and presented himself to the manager , a Mr. James O'Rourke . It bucks him up to think of James O'Rourke . He 'd been a father to him , more than his own dad , not that he had n't loved his father , but the dad had not looked after him . James O'Rourke smoothed over everything with McArdle 's for him . Later James O'Rourke had told him , " I knew from the first you were the lad for us . You had a feeling for things . I could see that . And of course your being a Pioneer did you no harm . " Not only James O'Rourke was at McArdle 's . Vincent had had the good fortune to meet Martin Ferris there , the greatest good fortune except of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , working beside Martin . Born partners they were . They started the saying then , and said it always to each other , until Martin 's death , was it five years now ? Six . " Partners we are and partners we shall be . " They 'd said it all those years . Both of them lived to be old . As young men they had not imagined that . A war could cut them down , an accident . They had been ready for those things that had not happened . Martin was adventurous , quick in his mind , like Ellen . And impatientlike her . But he was capable of studied concentration when a problem gripped him . Great talks they 'd had , sitting on the quayside , smoking cigarettes . Everything under the sun came up in those discussions . Women , God , the bosses , the economy . Martin was a socialist . He 'd lost his faith , although he said he respected Vincent for keeping his . ( It was strange , in middle life he became quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but quit soon after . The boys were not his type , and he said he could n't stand the presence of the priest . " I get the creeps around the blackbirds , Vince , " he said . Little by little , Vincent stopped going to the Pioneers himself . Cork , too , bored Martin . If Vincent suggested that they savep240up for stall seats at the theatre , Martin would bring up the theatre in New York , and say his brother 'd written about hearing Caruso at the opera . Always Martin 's talk was about New York , so when he blurted out that he was saving for his passage and would n't Vincent consider going with him , together they 'd be sure to get ahead , Vincent was not surprised . He 'd heard about the flat Martin'sbrother had , the unions that the Church could not put down , the opportunities for education . America was a place you could stretch your legs and take some giant steps , not like this godforsakencountry , where your every movement was hobbled both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river Lee and Martin would talk about New York as if he 'd been there , and soon Vincent wondered what it was he 'd seen in Cork . He thought that everything he liked in Cork would be a hundred , no , a million times superior in New York . He 'd miss his family , but he could help his parents and his sisters so they 'd not grow up dependent on the older brother 's whim , the girls could marry as they wished , for love or pleasure . He consulted Mr. Flannery back home , and James O'Rourke and Father Lavery . Their advice was all the same : America was a place for a boy with go ; he 'd keep himself back in this country . The time was now . He thinks about the day he told his mother . " I knew it , I knew it , " she said , rocking like a child desperate for a sense of movement . " I knew it when you left for Cork , I knew it was only the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father quieted her , ashamed at her woman 's outburst . She responded to the father 's hand around her wrist . He learned something from that about the life his parents had together , the life they 'd had before the children came . He thought of them together , planting out their first field in the spring before the brother 's birth . " I 'll have that one day , " he said to himself then . " One day I will marry . "  |p241He  'd waited till only a week before his passage before telling them . He thought it would allow his mother less time to grieve . But she felt tricked by his waiting , began to suspect he 'd had it in his mind to go for years . It was between them as they embraced , as they clasped hands , measured their hands together , their game continued from his childhood , laughing now that his hand was so much bigger . He allowed her to arrange walks for them that he knew led her to say to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down in her mind , one task done , a piece of linen mended , or a blanket put down in the chest for winter . And on the day before his leaving , he made no attempt to stop her tears when she said finally the thing he dreaded , " After you leave , I 'll not see you again . " He knew how she needed the spilling tears ; he 'd not deprive her . Though it made it hard for him . He wanted to be thinking of New York , the great streets and the buildings , the discussion groups he and Martin would join , the job prospects ahead of him . Thinking of those things would help him before his journey ; feeling his mother 's weeping body thrust against his own would never help . She was pregnant ; he 'd been shocked when she 'd told him . Shocked to have to think of her as a woman still young . " You may never see this one I 'm carrying , " she said . " You could die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sure it would be a boy . " I 'll be back in five years , " he said , knowing that he lied . The countryside was strewn with absences , the promise that he 'd made his mother had been made a hundred times in this same valley , and had not once been kept . He let her do all the things she needed to do , take him to all the places , but he allowed his own mind to wander . As he walked with her on a bridge over a small creek , holding her sobbing body , he concentrated on the age of the old stones , the stress of the bridge , its span . In his mind he was calculating problems in arithmetic . How much weight could **25;16970;TOOLONG were Mr. and Mrs. Meany 's faces . Mr. Meany 's granitic countenance was destroyed by fear , but his attention was riveted ; and Mrs. Meany 's lunatic gawking was characterized by a naked incomprehension . She had her hands clenched together in violent prayer , and her husband held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs as disturbing as the animal unhappiness of a retarded child . Owen sat up so suddenly in the mountain of hay that several front-pew members of the congregation were startled into gasps and cries of alarm . He bent stiffly at the waist , like a tightly wound spring , and he pointed with ferocity at his mother and father ; to many members of the congregation , he could have been pointing to anyone  --  or to them all . " WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE DOING HERE ? " the angry Lord Jesus screamed . Many members of the congregation thought he meant them ; I could tell what a shock the question was for Mr. Fish , but I knew whom Owen was speaking to . I saw Mr. and Mrs. Meany cringe ; they slipped off the pew to the kneeling pad , and Mrs. Meany covered her face with both hands . " YOU SHOULD N'T BE HERE ! " Owen shouted at them ; but Mr. Fish , and surely half the congregation , felt that they stood accused . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was apparent that they also thought Owen meant them . " IT IS A SACRILEGE FOR YOU TO BE HERE ! " Owen hollered . At least a dozen members of the congregation guiltily got up from the pews at the rear of the church  --  to leave . Mr. Meany helped his dizzy wife to her feet . She was crossing herself , repeatedly  --  a helpless , unthinking , Catholic gesture ; it must have infuriated Owen . The Meanys conducted an awkward departure ; they were big , broad people and their exit out of the crowded pew , their entrance into the aisle  --  where they stood out , so alone  --  their every movement was neither easy nor graceful . " We only wanted to see you ! " Owen 's father told him apologetically . But Owen Meany pointed to the door at the end of the nave , where several of the faithful had already departed ; Owen 's parents , like that other couple who were banished from the garden , left Christ Church as they were told . Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rector  --  sang " Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing " could spare the congregation the indelible image of how the Meanys had obeyed their only son . Rector Wiggin , wringing the Bible in both hands , was trying to catch the eye of his wife ; but Barb Wiggin was struck as immovable as stone . What the rector wanted was for his wife to darken the " pillar of light , " which continued to shine on the wrathful Lord Jesus.  | " GET ME OUT OF HERE ! " the Prince of Peace said to Joseph . And what is Joseph if not a man who does what he 's told ? I lifted him . Mary Beth Baird wanted to hold a part of him , too ; whether his goosing her had deepened her infatuation , or had put her in her place without trampling an iota of her ardor , is uncertain  --  regardless , she was his slave , at his command . And so together we raised him out of the hay . He was so stiffly wrapped , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bend , no matter how we held him . Where to go with him was not instantly clear . The back way , behind the altar area  --  the unobserved route we 'd all taken to the manger  --  was blocked by Barb Wiggin . As in other moments of indecision , the Christ Child directed us ; he pointed down the center aisle , in the direction his parents had taken . I doubt that anyone directed the cows and donkeys to follow us ; they just needed the air . Our procession gathered the force and numbers of a marching band . The third verse of what was supposed to be the Rev. Mr. Wiggin 's recessional carol heralded our exit . Mild he lays his glo-ry by , Born that man no more may die , Born to raise the sons of earth , Born to give them sec-ond birth . All the way down the center aisle , Barb Wiggin kept the " pillar of light " on us ; what possible force could have compelled her to do that ? There was nowhere to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows and the donkeys tore off their heads so that they could get a better look at him ; for the most part , these were the younger children  --  some of them , a very few of them , were actually smaller than Owen . They stared at him , in awe . The wind whipped through his swaddling clothes and his bare arms grew rosy ; he hugged them to his birdlike chest . The Meanys , sitting scared in the cab of the granite truck , were waiting for him . The Virgin Mother and I hoisted him into the cab ; because of how he was swaddled , he had to be extended full-length across the seat  --  his legs lay in his father 's lap , not quite interfering with Mr. Meany 's control of the steering wheel , and his head and upper body rested upon his mother , who had reverted to her custom of looking not quite out the window , and not quite at anything at all . " MY CLOTHES , " the Lord Jesus told me . " YOU GET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " I said . " IT 'S A GOOD THING I WORE MY LUCKY SCARF , " he told me . " TAKE ME HOME ! " he ordered his parents , and Mr. Meany lurched the truck into gear . A snowplow was turning on front Street onto Elliot ; it was customary inp202Gravesend to make way for snowplows , but even the snowplow made way for Owen . Toronto : February 4 , 1987  --  there was almost no one at the Wednesday morning communion service . Holy Eucharist is better when you do n't have to shuffle up the aisle in a herd and stand in line at the communion railing , like an animal awaiting space at the feeding-trough  --  just like another consumer at a fast-food service . I do n't like to take communion with a mob . I prefer the way the Rev. Mr. Foster serves the bread to the mischievous style of Canon Mackie ; the canon delights in giving me the tiniest wafer he has in his hand  --  a veritable crumb !  --  or else he gives me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mouth and impossible to swallow without prolonged chewing . The canon likes to tease me . He says , " Well , I figure that you take communion so often , it 's probably bad for your diet  --  someone 's got to look after your diet , John ! " And he chuckles about that ; or else he says , " Well , I figure that you take communion so often , you must be starving  --  someone 's got to give you a decent meal ! " And he chuckles some more . The Rev. Mr. Foster , our priest associate , at least dispenses the bread with a uniform sense of sacredness ; that 's all I ask . I have no quarrel with the wine ; it is ably served by our honorary assistants , the Rev. Mr. Larkin and the Rev. Mrs. Keeling  --  Mrs. Katherine Keeling ; she 's the headmistressat The Bishop Strachan School , and my only qualm with her is when she 's pregnant . The Rev. Katherine Keeling is often pregnant , and I do n't think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending forward to put the cup to our lips is a strain ; that makes me nervous ; also , when she 's very pregnant , and you 're kneeling at the railing waiting for the wine , it 's distracting to see her belly approach you at eye level . Then there 's the Rev. Mr. Larkin ; he sometimes pulls the cup back before the wine has touched your lips  --  you have to be quick with him ; and he 's a little careless how he wipes the rim of the cup each time . Of them all , the Rev. Mrs. Keeling is the best to talk to  --  now that Canon Campbell is gone . I truly like and admire Katherine Keeling . I regretted I could n't talk to her today , when I really needed to talk to someone ; but Mrs. Keeling is on temporary leave  --  she 's off having another baby . The Rev. Mr. Larkin is as quick to be gone from a conversation as he is quick with the communion cup ; and our priest associate , the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impatient with the fretting of a middle-aged man like myself , who lives in such comfort in the forest Hill part of town . The Rev. Mr. Foster is all for opening a mission on Jarvis Street  --  and counseling hookers on the subject of sexually transmitted diseases  --  and he 's up to his neck in volunteer projects for the West Indiansp203on Bathurst Street , the very same people so verbally abused by Deputy Warden Holt ; but the Rev. Mr. Foster offers scant sympathy for my worries , which , he says , are only in my mind . I love that " only " ! And that left Canon Mackie to talk to today ; Canon Mackie presents a familiar problem . I said , " Did you read the paper , today 's paper  --  The Globe and Mail ? It was on the front page . " " No , I 've not had time to read the paper this morning , " Canon Mackie said , " but let me guess . Was it something about the United States ? Something President Reagan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he is inexactly condescending . " There was a nuclear test yesterday  --  the first U.S. explosion of eighty-seven , " I said . " It was scheduled for tomorrow , but they moved it up  --  it was a way to fool the protesters . Naturally , there were planned protests  --  for tomorrow . " " Naturally , " said Canon Mackie . " And the Democrats had scheduled a vote  --  for today  --  on a resolution to persuade Reagan to cancel the test , " I told the canon . " The government even lied about the day the test was going to be . A fine use of the taxpayers ' money , eh ? " " You 're not a taxpayer in the United States  --  not anymore , " the canon said . " The Soviets said they would n't test any weapons until the U.S. tested first , " I told the canon . " Do n't you see how deliberately provocative this is ? How arrogant ! How unconcerned with any arms agreement  --  of any kind ! Every American should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two . Americans should be forced to see how ridiculous they appear to the rest of the world ! They should listen to someone else 's version of themselves  --  to anyone else 's version ! Every country knows more about America than Americans know about themselves ! And Americans know absolutely nothing about any other country ! " Canon Mackie observed me mildly . I could see it coming ; I talk about one thing , and he bends the subject of our conversation back to me . " I know you were upset about the Vestry elections , John , " he told me . " No one doubts your devotion to the church , you know . " Here I am , talking about nuclear war and the usual , self-righteous , American arrogance , and Canon Mackie wants to talk about me . " Surely you know how much this community respects you , John , " the canon told me . " But do n't you see how your . . . opinions can be disturbing ? It 's very American  --  to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very Canadian to distrust strong opinions . " " I 'm a Canadian , " I said . " I 've been a Canadian for twenty years . " Canon Mackie is a tall , stooped , bland-faced man , so plainly ugly thatp204his ungainly size is unthreatening  --  and so plainly decent that even his stubbornness of mind is not generally offensive . " John , John , " he said to me . " You 're a Canadian citizen , but what are you always talking about ? You talk about America more than any American I know ! And you 're more anti-American than any Canadian I know , " the canon said . " You 're a little . . . well , one-note on the subject , would n't you say ? " " No , I would n't , " I said . " John , John , " Canon Mackie said . " Your anger  --  that 's not very Canadian , either . " The canon knows how to get to me ; through my anger . " No , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't be sorry ! " the canon said cheerfully . " Try to be a little .. . different ! " The man 's pauses are almost as irritating as his advice . " It 's the damn Star Wars thing that gets to me , " I tried to tell him . " The only constraint on the arms race that remains is the nineteen seventy-two Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union . Now Reagan has given the Soviets an open invitation to test nuclear weapons of their own ; and if he proceeds with his missiles-in-space plans , he 'll give the Soviets an open invitation to junk the treaty of nineteen seventy-two , as well ! " " You have such a head for history , " the canon said . " How can you remember the dates ? " " Canon Mackie , " I said . " John , John , " the canon said . " I know you 're upset ; I 'm not mockingyou . I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " I do n't care about the Vestry elections ! " I said angrily  --  indicating , of course , how much I cared . " I 'm sorry , " I said . The canon put his warm , moist hand on my arm . " To our younger parish officers , " he said , " you 're something of an eccentric . They do n't understand those years that brought you here ; they wonder why  --  especially , when you defame the United States as vociferouslyas you do  --  why you are n't more Canadian than you are ! Because you 're not really a Canadian , you know  --  and that troubles some of the older members of this parish , too ; that troubles even those of us who do remember the circumstances that brought you here . If you made the choice to stay in Canada , why do you have so little to do with Canada ? Why have you learned so little about us ? John : it 's something of a joke , you knowhow you do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mackie in a nutshell ; I worry about a war , and the canon agonizes about how I get lost the second I step out of Forest Hill . I talk about the loss of the most substantive treaty that exists between the Sovietp205Union and the United States , and the canon teases me about my memory for dates ! Yes , I have a good head for dates . How about August 9 , 1974 ? Richard Nixon was finished . How about September 8 , 1974 ? Richard Nixon was pardoned . And then there was April 30 , 1975 : the U.S. Navy evacuated all remaining personnel from Vietnam ; they called this Operation Frequent Wind . Canon Mackie is skillfull with me , I have to admit . He mentions " dates " and what he calls my " head for history " to set up a familiar thesis : that I live in the past . Canon Mackie makes me wonder if my devotion to the memory of Canon Campbell is not also an aspect of how much I live in the past ; years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lived less in the past  --  or else , what we now call the past was then the present ; it was the actual time that Canon Campbell and I shared , and we were both caught up in it . If Canon Campbell were alive , if he were still rector of Grace Church , perhaps he would be no more sympathetic to me than Canon Mackie is sympathetic today . Canon Campbell was alive on January 21 , 1977 . That was the day President Jimmy Carter issued a pardon to the " draft-dodgers . " What did I care ? I was already a Canadian citizen . Although Canon Campbell cautioned me about my anger , too , he understood why that " pardon " made me so angry . I showed Canon Campbell the letter I wrote to Jimmy Carter . " Dear Mr. President , " I wrote . " Who will pardon the United States ? " Who can pardon the United States ? How can they be pardoned for Vietnam , for their conduct in Nicaragua , for their steadfast and gross contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , " Canon Mackie said . " Your little speech about Christmas  --  at the Parish Council meeting ? I doubt that even Scrooge would have chosen a Parish Council meeting as the proper occasion for such an announcement . " " I merely said that I found Christmas depressing , " I said . " Merely ' ! " said Canon Mackie . " The church counts very heavily on Christmas  --  for its missions , for its livelihood in this city . And Christmas is the focal point for the children in our church . " And what would the canon have said if I 'd told him that the Christmas of ' 53 put the finishing touches on Christmas for me ? He would have told me , again , that I was living in the past . So I said nothing . I had n't wanted to talk about Christmas in the first place . Is it any wonder how Christmas  --  ever since that Christmas  --  depresses me ? The Nativity I witnessed in ' 53 has replaced the old story . The Christp206is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more miraculous are the demands he succeeds in making , even before he can walk ! Not only does he demand to be worshiped and adored  --  by peasants and royalty , by animals and his own parents !  --  but he also banishes his mother and father from the house of prayer and song itself . I will never forget the inflamed color of his bare skin in the winter cold , and the hospital white-on-white of his swaddling clothes against the new snow  --  a vision of the little Lord Jesus as a born victim , born raw , born bandaged , born angry and accusing ; and wrapped so tightly that he could not bend at the knees at all and had to lie on his parents ' laps as stiffly as someone who , mortally wounded , lies upon a stretcher . How can you like Christmas after that ? Before I became a believer , I could at least enjoy the fantasy . That Sunday , feeling the wind cut through my Joseph-robe out on Elliot Street , contributed to my belief in  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggled out of the nave ; how they hated to have their rituals revised without warning . The rector was not on the steps to shake their hands because so many of the congregation had followed our triumphant exit , leaving the Rev. Mr. Wiggin stranded at the altar with his benediction unsaid  --  he was supposed to have delivered his benediction from the nave , where the recessional should have led him ( and not us ) . And what was Barb Wiggin supposed to do with the " pillar of light , " now that she had craned the light to follow the Lord Jesus and his tribe to the door ? Dan Needham told me later that the Rev. Dudley Wiggin made a most unusual gesture for the rector of Christ Church to make from the pulpit ; he drew his forefinger across his throat  --  a signal to his wife to kill the light , which ( only after we 'd departed ) she finally did . But to many of the bewildered congregation , who took their cues from the rector  --  for how else should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unique celebration ?  --  the gesture of the Rev. Dudley Wiggin slashing his own throat was particularly gripping . Mr. Fish , in his inexperience , imitated the gesture as if it were a command  --  and then looked to Dan for approval . Dan observed that Mr. Fish was not alone . And what were we supposed to do ? Our gang from the manger , ill-dressed for the weather , huddled uncertainly together after the granite truck turned onto Front Street and out of sight . The revived hind part of one donkey ran to the door of the parish-house vestibule , which he found locked ; the cows slipped in the snow . Where could we go but back in the main door ? Had someone locked the parish house out of fear that thieves would steal our real clothes ? To our knowledge , there was no shortage of clothes like ours in Gravesend , and no robbers . And so we bucked against the grain ; we fought against the congregation -- they were coming out  --  inp207order that we might get back in . For Barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth as a flight free of bumpy air  --  and one that departs and arrives on time  --  the sight of the traffic jam in the nave of the church must have caused further upset . Smaller angels and shepherds darted between the grown-ups ' legs ; the more stately kings , clutching their toppled crowns  --  and the clumsier cows , and the donkeys now in halves  --  made awkward progress against the flow of bulky overcoats . The countenances of many a parishioner reflected shock and insult , as if the Lord Jesus had just spat in their faces  --  to deem them sacrilegious . Among the older members of the congregation  --  with whom the jocular Captain Wiggin and his brash wife were not an overnight success  --  there was a stewing anger , apparent in their frowns and scowls , as if the shameful pageant they had just witnessed were the rector 's idea of something " modern . " Whatever it was , they had n't liked it , and their reluctant acceptance of the ex-pilot would be delayed for a few more years . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as baffled as the Episcopalian congregation  --  regarding what he and his wife were supposed to do next . They were nearer the nave of the church than was the rector , who was nowhere to be found , and if the Rev. Mr. Merrill continued to press , with the throng , toward the door , he might find himself out on the steps  --  in a position to shake hands with the departing souls  --  in advance of the Rev. Mr. Wiggin 's appearance there . It was surely not Pastor Merrill 's responsibility to shake hands with Episcopalians , following their botched pageant . God forbid that any of them might think that he was the reason for the pageant being so peculiarly wrecked , or that this was how the Congregationalists interpreted the Nativity .. " Your little friend ? " Mr. Merrill asked in a whisper . " Is he always so . . . like that ? " Is he always like what ? I thought . But in the crush of the crowd , it would have been hard to stand my ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " I said . " That 's Owen , this was pure Owen today . He 's unpredictable , but he 's always in charge . " " He 's quite . . . miraculous , " the Rev. Mr. Merrill said , smiling faintly  --  clearly glad that the Congregationalists preferred caroling to pageants , and clearly relieved that Owen Meany had moved no farther down the Protestant rungs than the Episcopalians . The pastor was probably imagining what sort of damage Owen might accomplish at a Vesper service . Dan grabbed me in the connecting passage to the parish house ; he said he 'd wait for me to get my clothes , and Owen 's  --  we could go hack to the dorm together , then , or to 80 Hon ( Street . Mr. Fish was happy and agitated ;  |p208if  he thought that the Rev. Dudley Wiggin 's " slashing his throat " was a part of the rector 's annual performance , he also imagined that everything Owen had done was in the script  --  and Mr. Fish had been quite impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part when he tells the angel what to say  --  that 's brilliant , " Mr. Fish said . " And how he throws his mother aside  --  how he starts right in with the criticism . . . I mean , you get the idea , right away , that this is no ordinary baby . You know , he 's the Lord ! Jesus  --  from Day One . I mean , he 's born giving orders , telling everyone what to do . I thought you told me he did n't have a speaking part ! I had no idea it was so ... primitive a ritual , so violent , so barbaric . But it 's very moving , " Mr. Fish added hastily , lest Dan and I be offended to hear our religion described as " primitive " and " barbaric . " " It 's not quite what the . . . author . . . intended , " Dan told Mr. Fish . I left Dan explaining the deviations from the expected to the excited amateur actor  --  I wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry , without encountering either of the Wiggins . But I was a while getting my hands on Owen 's clothes . Mary Beth Baird had balled them up with her own in a corner of the vestibule , where she then lay down to weep  --  on top of them . It was complicated , getting her to relinquish Owen 's clothes without striking her ; and impossible to interrupt her sobbing . Everything that had upset the little Lord Jesus had been her fault , in her opinion ; she had not only failed to soothe him  --  she 'd been a bad mother in general . Owen hated her , she claimed . How she wished she understood him better ! Yet , somehow  --  as she explained to me , through her tears  --  she was sure she " understood " him better than anyone else did . At age eleven , I was too young to glimpse a vision of what sort of overwrought wife and mother Mary Beth Baird would make ; there in the vestibule , I wanted only to hit her  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddle of tears . The very idea of her understanding Owen Meany made me sick ! What she really meant was that she wanted to take him home and lie on top of him ; her idea of understanding him began and ended with her desire to cover his body , to never let him get up . Because I was slow in leaving the vestibule , Barb Wiggin caught me . " You can give him this message when you give him his clothes , " she hissed to me , her fingers digging into my shoulder and shaking me . " Tell him he 's to come see me before he 's allowed back in this church  --  before the next Sunday school class , before he comes to another service . He comes to see me first . He 's not allowed here until he sees me ! " she repeated , giving me one last shake for good measure . I was so upset that I blurted it all out to Dan , who was hanging around the altar area with Mr. Fish , who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manger and at the few gifts abandoned by the Christ Child there , asp209if some meaning could be discerned from the arrangement of the debris . I told Dan what Barb Wiggin had said , and how she 'd given Owen a hard-on , and how there had been virtual warfare between them  --  and now , I was sure , Owen would never be " allowed " to be an Episcopalian again . If seeing her was a prerequisite for Owen to return to Christ Church , then Owen , I knew , would be as shunning of us Episcopalians as he was presently shunning of Catholics . 1 became quite exercised in relating this scenario to Dan , who sat beside me in a front-row pew and listened sympathetically . Mr. Fish came and told us that the angel was still " on-high . " He wondered if this was a part of the script  --  to leave Harold Crosby hanging in the rafters long after the manger and the pews had emptied ? Harold Crosby , who thought both his God and Barb Wiggin had abandoned him forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mock flying buttresses ; Dan , an accomplished mechanic of all theatrical equipment , eventually mastered the angel-lowering apparatus and returned the banished angel to terra firma , where Harold collapsed in relief and gratitude . He had thrown up all over himself , and  --  in attempting to wipe himself with one of his wings  --  he 'd made quite an unsalvageable mess of his costume . That was when Dan carried out his responsibilities as a stepfather in most concrete , even heroic terms . He carried the sodden Harold Crosby to the parish-house vestibule , where he asked Barb Wiggin if he might have a word with her . " Ca n't you see ... " she asked him , " that this is n't the best of times ? " " I should not want to bring up the matter  --  of how you left this boy hanging  --  with the Vestry members , " Dan said to her . He held Harold Crosby with some difficulty  --  not only because Harold was heavy and wet , but because the stench of vomit , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't the best of times to bring up anything with me , " Barb Wiggin cautioned , but Dan Needham was not a man to be bullied by a stewardess . " Nobody cares what sort of mess-up happens at a children 's pageant , " Dan said , " but this boy was left hanging  --  twenty feet above a concrete floor ! A serious accident might have occurred  --  due to your negligence . " Harold Crosby shut his eyes , as if he feared Barb Wiggin was going to hit him  --  or strap him back in the angel-raising apparatus . " I regret  --  " Barb Wiggin began , but Dan cut her off . " You will not lay down any laws for Owen Meany , " Dan Needham told her . " You are not the rector , you are the rector 's wife . You had a job  --  to return this boy , safely , to the floor  --  and you forgot all about it . I will forget all about it , too- - and you will forget about seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; he does n't require your permission to be here . Ifp210the rector would like to speak with Owen , have the rector call me . " And here Dan Needham released the slippery Harold Crosby , whose manner of groping for his clothes suggested that the angel apparatus had cut off all circulation to his legs ; he wobbled unsteadily about the vestibule  --  the other children getting out of his way because of his smell . Dan Needham put his hand on the back of my neck ; he pushed me gently forward until I was standing directly between Barb Wiggin and him . " This boy is not your messenger , Missus Wiggin , " Dan said . " I should not want to bring up any of this with the Vestry members , " he repeated . Stewardesses have , at best , marginal authority ; Barb Wiggin knew when her authority had slipped . She looked awfully ready-to-please , so readyto-pleasethat I was embarrassed for her . She turned her attention , eagerly , to the task of getting Harold Crosby into fresher clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vestibule as Dan and I were leaving the parish house . " My , that looked like fun ! " Mrs. Crosby said . " Did you have fun , dear ? " she asked him . When Harold nodded , Barb Wiggin spontaneously hugged him against her hip . Mr. Fish had found the rector . The Rev. Dudley Wiggin was occupying himself with the Christmas candles , measuring them to ascertain which were still long enough to be used again next year . The Rev. Dudley Wiggin had a pilot 's healthy instinct for looking ahead ; he did not dwell on the present  --  especially not on the disasters . He would never call Dan and ask to speak to Owen ; Owen would be " allowed " at Christ Church without any consultation with the rector . " I like the way Joseph and Mary carry the Baby Jesus out of the manger , " Mr. Fish was saying . " Ah , do you ? Ah , yes , " the rector said . " It 's a great ending  --  very dramatic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? " the rector said . " Perhaps we 'll work out a similar ending  --  next year . " " Of course , the part requires someone with Owen 's presence , " Mr. Fish said . " I 'll bet you do n't get a Christ Child like him every year . " " No , not like him , " the rector agreed . " He 's a natural , " Mr. Fish said . " Yes , is n't he ? " Mr. Wiggin said . " Have you seen A Christmas Carol ? " Mr. Fish asked . " Not this year , " the rector said . " What are you doing on Christmas Eve ? " Mr. Fish asked him . I knew what I wished I was doing on Christmas Eve : I wished I was in Sawyer Depot , waiting with my mother for I ) an to arrive on the midnight train . That 's how our Christmas Eves had been , since my mother had gottenp211together with Dan . Mother and I would enjoy the Eastmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent cousins , and Dan would join us after the Christmas Eve performance of The Gravesend Players . He would be tired when he got off the train from Gravesend , at midnight , but everyone in the Eastman house  --  even my grandmother  --  would be waiting up for him . Uncle Alfred would fix Dan a " nightcap , " while my mother and Aunt Martha put Noah and Simon and Hester and me to bed . At a quarter to twelve , Hester and Simon and Noah and I would bundle up and cross the street to the depot ; the weather in the north country on a Christmas Eve , at midnight , was not inviting to grown-ups  --  the grown-ups all approved of letting us kids meet Dan 's train . We liked to be early so we could make plenty of snowballs ; the train was always on time  --  in those days . There were few people on it , and almost no one but Dan got off in Sawyer Depot , where we would pelt him with snowballs . As tired as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening , my mother and Aunt Martha sang Christmas carols ; sometimes my grandmother would join in . We children could remember most of the words to the first verses ; it was in the later verses of the carols that my mother and Aunt Martha put their years in the Congregational Church Choir to the test . My mother won that contest ; she knew every word to every verse , so that  --  as a carol progressed  --  we heard nothing at all from Grandmother , and less and less from Aunt Martha . In the end , my mother got to sing the last verses by herself . " What a waste , Tabby ! " Aunt Martha would say . " It 's an absolute waste of your memory  --  knowing all those words to the verses no one ever sings ! " " What else do I need my memory for ? " my mother asked her sister ; the two women would smile at each other  --  my Aunt Martha coveting that part of my mother 's memory that might tell her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha about my mother 's total recall of Christmas carols was that my mother got to sing those last verses solo ; even Uncle Alfred would stop what he was doing just to listen to my mother 's voice . I remember  --  it was at my mother 's funeral  --  when the Rev. Lewis Merrill told my grandmother that he 'd lost my mother 's voice twice . The first time was when Martha got married , because that was when both girls started spending Christmas vacations in Sawyer Depot  --  my mother would still practice singing carols with the choir , but she was gone to visit her sister by the Sunday of Christmas Vespers . The second time that Pastor Merrill lost my mother 's voice was when she moved to Christ Church  --  when he lost it forever . But I had not lost her voice until Christmas Eve , 1953 , when the town I was horn in and grew up in felt so unfamiliar to me ; Gravesend just never was my Christmas Eve town.  |p212Of  course , I was grateful to have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas Carol  --  including the dress rehearsal  --  I was especially glad that the final production was available to take up the time on Christmas Eve ; I think both Dan and I wanted our time taken up . After the play , Dan had scheduled a cast party  --  and I understood why he 'd done that : to take up every minute until midnight , and even past midnight , so that he would n't be thinking of riding the train to Sawyer Depot ( and my mother in the Eastrnans ' warm house , waiting for him ) . I could picture the Eastmans having a hard time on Christmas Eve , too ; after the first verse , Aunt Martha would be struggling with each carol . Dan had wanted to have the cast party at 80 Front Street  --  and I understood that , too : he wanted my grandmother to be just as busy as he was . Of course , Grandmother would have complained bitterly about the party revelers  --  and about such a " sundry " guest list , given the diverse personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Grandmother would , at least , have been occupied . As it was , she refused ; Dan had to beg her to get her to see the play . At first , she gave him every excuse  --  she could n't possibly leave Lydia alone , Lydia was sick , there was some congestion in her lungs or bronchial tubes , and it was out of the question that Lydia could go out to a play ; furthermore , Grandmother argued , it being Christmas Eve , she had allowed Ethel to visit her next of kin ( Ethel would be gone for Christmas Day , and the next day , too ) , and surely Dan knew how Lydia hated to be left alone with Germaine . Dan pointed out that he thought Germaine had been hired , specifically , to look after Lydia . Yes , Grandmother nodded , that was certainly true  --  nevertheless , the girl was dismal , superstitious company , and what Lydia needed on Christmas Eve was company . It was , Dan politely reasoned , " strictly for company 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol , and even spend a short time enjoying the festive atmosphere of the cast party . Since my grandmother had refused him the use of 80 Front Street , Dan had decorated the entire third floor of Waterhouse Hall  --  opening a few of the less-cluttered boys ' rooms , and the common room on that floor , for the cast ; his own tiny apartment just would n't suffice . He 'd alerted the Brinker-Smiths that there might be a rumpus two floors above them ; they were welcome to join the festivities , or plug up the twins ' ears with cotton , as they saw fit . Grandmother did not see fit to do a damn thing , but she enjoyed Dan 's efforts to cajole her out of her veteran , antisocial cantankerousness , and she agreed to attend the play ; as for the cast party , she would see how she felt after the performance . And so it tell to me : the task of escorting Grandmother to the closing-night enactment of A Christmas Carol in thep213Gravesend Town Hall . I took many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hip  --  although the sidewalks were safely sanded , there 'd been no new snowfall , and the well-oiled wood of the old Town Meeting place was slipperier than any surface Grandmother was likely to encounter outdoors . The hinges of the ancient folding chairs creaked in unison as I led Harriet Wheelwright to a favored center-aisle seat in the third row , our townspeople 's heads turning in the manner that a congregation turns to view a bride  --  for my grandmother entered the theater as if she were still responding to a curtain call , following her long-ago performance in Maugham 's The Constant Wife . Harriet Wheelwright had a gift for making a regal entry . There was even some scattered applause , which Grandmother quieted with a well-aimed glower ; respect , in the form of awe  --  preferably , silent awe  --  was something she courted , but hand-clapping was , under the circumstances , vulgar . It took a full five minutes for her to be comfortably seated  --  her mink off , but positioned over her shoulders ; her scarf loosened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known to approach from the rear ) ; her hat on , despite the fact that no one seated behind her could see over it ( graciously , the gentleman so seated moved ) . At last , I was free to venture backstage , where I had grown used to the aura of spiritual calm surrounding Owen Meany at the makeup mirror . The trauma of the Christmas Pageant shone in his eyes like a death in the family ; his cold had settled deep in his chest , and a fever drove him to alternate states  --  first he burned , then he sweated , then he shivered . He needed very little eyeliner to deepen the darkness entombing his eyes , and his nightly , excessive applications of baby powder to his face  --  which was already as white as the face of a china doll  --  had covered the makeup table with a silt as fine as plaster dust , in which Owen wrote his name with his finger in square , block letters , the style of lettering favored in the Meany Monument Shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his parents ' attendance at the Christ Church Nativity . When I suggested that his response to their presence in the congregation had been radical and severe , he dismissed me in a fashion he 'd perfected  --  by forgiving me for what I could n't be expected to know , and what he would never explain to me : that old UNSPEAKABLE OUTRAGE that the Catholics had perpetrated , and his parents ' inability to rise above what amounted to the RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION they had suffered ; yet it was my opinion that Owen was persecuting his parents . Why they accepted such persecution was a mystery to me . From backstage I was uniquely positioned to search the audience for thep214acquiescent presence of Mr. and Mrs. Meany ; they were not there . My search was rewarded , however , by the discovery of a sanguinary Mr. Morrison , the cowardly mailman , his eyes darting daggers in all directions , and wringing his hands  --  as he might around a throat  --  in his lap . The look of a man who 's come to see What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; should Owen succumb to his fever , Mr. Morrison looked ready to play the part . It was a full house ; to my surprise , I 'd seen many of the audience at earlier performances . The Rev. Lewis Merrill , for example , was back for a second , maybe even a third time ! He always came to dress rehearsals , and often to a later performance ; he told Dan he enjoyed watching the actors " settle into " their parts . Being a minister , he must have especially enjoyed A Christmas Carol ; it was such a heartfelt rendering of a conversion  --  not just a lesson in Christian charity , but an example of man 's humbleness before the spiritual world . Even so , I could not find Rector Wiggin in the audience ; I had no expectations of finding Barb , either  --  I would guess their exposure to Owen Meany 's interpretations of the spiritual world was sufficient to inspire them , until next Christmas . Lewis Merrill , forever in the company of the sour stamina that radiated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled children ; often rebellious , almost always unruly , uniformly sullen , the Merrill children acted out their displeasure at being dragged to an amateur theatrical . The tallish boy , the notorious cemetery vandal , sprawled his legs into the center aisle , indifferently creating a hazard for the elderly , the infirm , and the unwary . The middle child , a girl  --  her hair so brutally short , in keeping with her square , shapeless body , that she might have been a boy  --  brooded loudly over her bubble gum . She had sunk herself so low in her seat that her knees caused considerable discomfort to the back of the neck of the unfortunate citizen who sat in front of her . He was a plump , mild , middle-aged man who taught something in the sciences at Gravesend Academy ; and when he turned round in his seat to reprove the girl with a scientific glance , she popped a bubble at him with her gum . The third and youngest child , of undetermined sex , crawled under the seats , disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film of grime and ashes  --  and all manner of muck that the patrons had brought in upon their winter boots . Through all the unpleasantness created by her children , Mrs. Merrill suffered silently . Although they caused her obvious pain , she was unprotesting  --  since nearly everything caused her pain , she thought it would be unfair to single them out for special distinction . Mr. Merrill gazed undistracted toward center stage , apparently transfixed by the crack where the curtain would part ; he appeared to believe that by his special scrutiny ofp215this opening , by a supreme act of concentration , he might inspire the curtains to open . Why , then , was he so surprised when they did ? Why was I so surprised by the applause that greeted old Scrooge in his countinghouse ? It was the way the play had opened every night ; but it was n't until Christmas Eve that it occurred to me how many of these same townspeople must have been present in those bleacher seats that summer day  --  applauding , or on the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . And , yes , there was fat Mr. Chickering , whose warm-up jacket had kept me from too close a view of the mortal injury ; yes , there was Police Chief Pike . As always , he was stationed by the door , his suspicious eyes roaming the audience as much as they toured the stage , as if Chief Pike suspected that the culprit might have brought the stolen baseball to the play ! " If I could work my will , ' " said Mr. Fish indignantly , " every idiot who goes about with " Merry Christmas " on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding , and buried with a stake of holly through his heart . ' " I saw Mr. Morrison silently move his mouth to every word  --  in the absence of any lines to learn ( as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come ) , he had learned all of Scrooge 's lines by heart . What had he made of the foul ball that so spectacularly spun my mother around ? Had he been there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty 's sake ? Just before Owen made contact , my mother had noticed someone in the bleachers ; as I remembered it , she was waving to someone just before she was struck . She had not been waving to Mr. Morrison , I was sure ; his cynical presence did n't inspire a greeting as unselfconscious as a wave  --  that lugubrious mailman did not invite so much as a nod of recognition . Yet who was that someone my mother had been waving to , whose was the last face she 'd seen , the face she 'd singled out in the crowd , the face she 'd found there and had closed her eyes upon at the moment of her death ? With a shudder , I tried to imagine who it could have been  --  if not my grandmother , if not Dan .. . " I wear the chain I forged in life , ' " Marley 's Ghost told Scrooge ; with my attention fixed upon the audience , I had known where I was in the play by the clanking of Marley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marley told Scrooge . " The common welfare was my business ; charity , mercy , forbearance , acid benevolence were all my business . The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business ! ' " With a shudder , I imagined that it had been my father in the bleachers  --  it had been tnv father she 'd waved to the instant she was killed ! With no idea how I might hope to recognize him , I began with the front row , left-center ; I went through the audience , face by face . From my perspective ,  |p216backstage  , the faces in the audience were almost uniformly still , and the attention upon them was not directed toward me ; the faces were , at least in part , strangers to me , and  --  especially in the back rows  --  smaller than the faces on baseball cards . It was a futile search ; but it was then and there that I started to remember . From backstage , watching the Christmas Eve faces of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats on that summer day  --  row by row , I could remember a few of the baseball fans who had been there . Mrs. Kenmore , the butcher 's wife , and their son Donny , a rheumaticfeverbaby who was not allowed to play baseball ; they attended every game . They were in attendance at A Christmas Carol to watch Mr. Kenmore slaughter the part of the Ghost of Christmas Present ; but I could see them in their short-sleeved summer garb , with their identically sunburned noses  --  they always sat down low in the bleachers , because Donny was not agile and Mrs. Kenmore feared he would fall through the slats . And there was Mr. Early 's daughter , Maureen  --  reputed to have wet her pants when Owen Meany tried out for the part of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come . She was here tonight , and had been present every night , to watch her father 's vain attempts to make Marley 's Ghost resemble King Lear . She simultaneously worshiped and despised her father , who was a terrible snob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his expectations for her ; at the very least , she would one day have her doctorate  --  and if she were to indulge her fantasy , and become a movie star , she would make her reputation on the silver screen only after numerous triumphs in " legitimate " theater . Maureen Early was a dreamer who squirmed in her seat  --  whether she was watching her father overact or watching Owen Meany approach home plate . I remembered that she had been sitting in the top row , squirming beside Caroline O'Day , whose father ran the Chevy dealership . Caroline O'Day was one of those rare parochialschoolgirls who managed to wear her St. Michael 's uniform  --  her pleated flannel skirt and matching burgundy knee socks  --  as if she were a cocktail waitress in a lounge of questionable repute . With boys , Caroline O'Day was as aggressive as a Corvette , and Maureen Early enjoyed her company because Mr. Early thought the O'Days were vulgar . It had not set well with Mr. Early that Caroline 's father , Larry O'Day , had secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handsomer than Mr. Early , and Dan Needham knew that a Chevy salesman 's derring-do was far preferable to Mr. Early 's attempting to turn Bob Crachit into King Lear . How I remembered them on that summer day  --  Maureen Early and Caroline O'Day  --  how they had laughed and squirmed in their seats together when Owen Meany came to bat . What a power I had discovered ! I kit certain I could refill those bleacherp217seats  --  one day , I was sure , I could " see " everyone who 'd been there ; I could find that special someone my mother had waved to , at the end . Mr. Arthur Dowling had been there ; I could see him shade his eyes with one hand , his other hand shading his wife 's eyes  --  he was that sort of servant to her . Arthur Dowling was watching A Christmas Carol because his wife , the most officious member of the Town Library Board , was steering her humorless self through the chore of being the Ghost of Christmas Past . Amanda Dowling was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes  --  fancy dress , for her , meant a coat and tie  --  and when she smoked , she blew smoke in men 's faces , this being at the heart of her opinions regarding how men behaved toward women . Both her husband and Amanda were in favor of creating mayhem with sexual stereotypes , or reversing sexual roles as arduously and as self-consciously as possible  --  hence , he often wore an apron while shopping ; hence , her hair was shorter than his , except on her legs and in her armpits , where she grew it long . There were certain positive words in their vocabulary  --  " European , " among them ; women who did n't shave their armpits or their legs were more " European " than American women , to their undoubted advantage . They were childless  --  Dan Needham suggested that their sexual roles might be so " reversed " as to make childbearing difficult  --  and their attendance at Little League games was marked by a constant disapproval of the sport : that little girls were not allowed to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exercised the Dowlings ' humorlessnessand fury . Should they have a daughter , they warned , she would play in the Little League . They were a couple with a theme  --  sadly , it was their only theme , and a small theme , and they overplayed it , but a young couple with such a burning mission was quite interesting to the generally slow , accepting types who were more typical in Gravesend . Mr. Chickering , our fat coach and manager , lived in dread of the day the Dowlings might produce a daughter . Mr. Chickering was of the old school  --  he believed that only boys should play baseball , and that girls should watch them play , or else play softball . Like many small-town world-changers , the Dowlings were independently wealthy ; he , in fact , did nothing  --  except he was a ceaseless interior decorator of his own well-appointed house and a manicure artist when the subject was his lawn . In his early thirties , Arthur Dowling had developed the habit of puttering to a level of frenzy quite beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the putterers . Amanda Dowling did n't work , either , but she was tireless in her pursuit of the hoard-member life . She was a trustee of evet-whin , t , and the Town Library was not the only hoard she served ; it was simply the hoard she was mostp218often associated with , because it was a board she served with special vengeance . Among the methods she preferred for changing the world , banning books was high on her list . Sexual stereotypes did not fall , she liked to say , from the clear blue sky ; books were the major influences upon children  --  and books that had boys being boys , and girls being girls , were among the worst offenders ! Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , for example ; they were an education in condescension to women  --  all by themselves , they created sexual stereotypes ! Wuthering Heights , for example : how that book taught a woman to submit to a man made Amanda Dowling " see red , " as she would say . As for the Dowlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their campaign was relentless , but minor ; she tried out for parts conventionally bestowed upon men ; he went after the lesser women 's roles  --  preferably nonspeaking . She was more ambitious than he was , befitting a woman determined to reverse sexual stereotypes ; she thought that speaking parts for males were perfect for her . Dan Needham gave them what he could ; to deny them outright would risk the charge they relished to make , and made often  --  that so-and-so was " discriminatory . " A patterned absurdity marked each Dowling 's role onstage ; Amanda was terrible as a man  --  but she would have been just as terrible as a woman , Dan was quick to point out  --  and Arthur was simply terrible . The townspeople enjoyed them in the manner that only people from small towns  --  who know how everyone 's apron is tied , and by whom  --  can enjoy tedious eccentrics . The Dowlings were tedious , their eccentricity was flawed and made small by the utter predictability of their highly selective passions ; yet they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if familiar , entertainment . Dan Needham knew better than to tamper with them . How I astonished myself that Christmas Eve ! With diligence , with months  --  even years  --  backstage in the Gravesend Town Hall , I knew I could find the face my mother had waved to in the stands . Why not at the baseball games themselves ? you might wonder . Why not observe the actual fans in the actual bleachers ? People tend to take the same seats . But at Dan 's theater I had an advantage ; I could watch the audience unseen  --  and I would not be drawing attention to myself by putting myself between the field of play and them . Backstage , and all that this implies , is invisible . You can see more in faces that ca n't see you . If I was looking for my father , should n't I look for him unobserved ? " ' Spirit ! ' " said Scrooge to the Ghost of Christmas Past . " ' Remove me from this place . ' " And I watched Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ip219told you these were shadows of the things that had been . That they are what they are , ' " Amanda Dowling said , " ' do not blame me ! ' " I watched my fellow townspeople snicker  --  all but Mr. Arthur Dowling , who remained seriously impressed by the reversed sexual role he saw before him . That the Dowlings " took turns " at The Gravesend Players  --  that they never took roles in the same play  --  was a great source of mirth to Dan , who enjoyed joking with Mr. Fish . " I wonder if the Dowlings take turns ' sexually ! " Dan would say . " It 's most unpleasant to imagine , " Mr. Fish would say . What daydreams I accomplished backstage on Christmas Eve ! How I fed myself memories from the faces of my fellow townspeople ! When Mr. Fish asked the Ghost of Christmas Present if the poor , wretched children were his , the Spirit told him , " ' They are Man 's . ' " How proud Mrs. Kenmore was of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their son Donny jumped for joy to see his father with words instead of meat at his fingertips ! " ' This boy is Ignorance , ' " the butcher said . " ' This girl is Want . Beware of them both , and all of their degree , but most of all beware this boy , for on his brow I see that written which is Doom , unless the writing be encased . ' " He meant " ' erased ' " ; but Mr. Kenmore was probably thinking of sausages . On the trusting faces of my fellow townspeople there was no more awareness of Mr. Kenmore 's error than Mr. Kenmore himself possessed ; of the faces I surveyed , only Harriet Wheelwright  --  who had seen almost as many versions of A Christmas Carol as Dan Needham had directed  --  winced to hear the butcher butcher his line . My grandmother , a born critic , briefly closed her eyes and sighed . Such was my interest in the audience , I did not turn to face the stage until Owen Meany made his appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was there . A hush fell over the audience . The faces of my fellow townspeople  --  so amused , so curious , so various  --  were rendered shockingly similar ; each face became the model of each other 's fear . Even my grandmother  --  so detached , so superior  --  drew her fur closer around her shoulders and shivered : an apparent draft had touched the necks of my fellow townspeople ; the shiver that passed through my grandmother appeared to pass through them all . Donny Kenmore clutched his rheumatic heart ; Maureen Early , determined not to pee in her pants again , shut her eyes . The look of dread upon the face of Mr. Arthur Dowling surpassed even his interest in sexual role-reversal  --  for neither the sex nor the identity of Owen Meany was clear ; what was clear was that he was a ghost . " ' Ghost of the Future ! ' " Mr. Fish exclaimed . " ' I fear you more than any specter I have seen . ' " To observe the terror upon my fellow townspeople'sfaces was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish 's assessment of this ghost 's fearful qualities . " Will you not speak to me ? ' " Scrooge pleaded . Owen coughed . It was not , as Dan had hoped , a " humanizing " sound ; it was a rattle so deep , and so deeply associated with death , that the audience was startled  --  people twitched in their seats ; Maureen Early , abandoning all hope of containing her urine , opened her eyes wide and stared at the source of such an unearthly bark . That was when I turned to look at him , too  --  at the instant his baby-powdered hand shot out of the black folds of his cowl , and he pointed . A fever chill sent a spasm down his trembling arm , and his hand responded to the jolt as to electricity . Mr. Fish flinched . " Lead on ! ' " cried Scrooge . " Lead on ! ' " Gliding across the stage , Owen Meany led him . But the future was never quite clear enough for Scrooge to see it  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A worthy place ! " Dickens called it ... " overrun by grass and weeds , the growth of vegetation 's death , not life ; choked up with too much burying , fat with repleted appetite . " " Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point , ' " Scrooge began to say . Among the papier-mache gravestones , where Mr. Fish was standing , one stone loomed larger than the others ; it was this stone that Owen pointed to  --  again and again , he pointed and pointed . So that Mr. Fish would stop stalling  --  and get to the part where he reads his own name on that grave  --  Owen stepped closer to the gravestone himself . Scrooge began to babble . " Men 's courses will foreshadow certain ends , to which , if persevered in , they must lead . But , ' " Mr. Fish said to Owen , " if the courses be departed from , the ends will change . Say it is thus with what you show me ! ' " Owen Meany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing to read the name he saw there to himself , he directly fainted . " Owen ! " Mr. Fish said crossly , but Owen was as committed to not answering as the Ghost of the Future . " Owen ? " Mr. Fish asked , more sympathetically ; the audience appeared to sympathize with Mr. Fish 's reluctance to touch the slumped , hooded figure . It would be just like Owen , I thought , to regain consciousness by jumping to his feet and screaming ; this was exactly what Owen did  --  before Dan Needham could call for the curtain . Mr. Fish fell over what was meant to be his grave , and the sheer terror in Owen 's cry was matched by a corresponding terror in the audience . There were screams , there were gasps ; I knew that Maureen Early 's pants were wet again . Just what had the Ghost of the Future actually seen ?  |p221Mr  . Fish , a veteran at making the best of a mess , found himself sprawled on the stage in a perfect position to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had half-crushed , in falling over it . " Ebenezer Scrooge ! Am I that man ? ' " he asked Owen , but something was wrong with Owen , who appeared to be more frightened of the papier-mache gravestone than Scrooge was afraid of it ; Owen kept backing away . He retreated across the stage , with Mr. Fish imploring him for an answer . Without a word , without so much as pointing again at the gravestone that had the power to frighten even the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , Owen Meany retreated offstage . In the dressing room , he sobbed upon the makeup table , coating his hair with baby powder , the black eyeliner streaking his face . Dan Needham felt his forehead . " You 're burning up , Owen ! " Dan said . " I 'm getting you straight home , and straight to bed . " " What is it ? What happened ? " I asked Owen , but he shook his head and cried harder . " He fainted , that 's what happened ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he all right ? " Mr. Fish asked from the door ; Dan had called for a curtain before Mr. Fish 's last scene . " Are you all right , Owen ? " Mr. Fish asked . " My God , you looked as if you 'd seen a ghost ! " " I 've seen everything now , " Dan said . " I 've seen Scrooge upstaged , I 've seen the Ghost of the Future scare himself ! " The Rev. Lewis Merrill came to the crowded dressing room to offer his assistance , although Owen appeared more in need of a doctor than a minister . " Owen ? " Pastor Merrill asked . " Are you all right ? " Owen shook his head . " What did you see ? " Owen stopped crying and looked up at him . That Pastor Merrill seemed so sure that Owen had seen something surprised me . Being a minister , being a man of faith , perhaps he was more familiar with " visions " than the rest of us ; possibly he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? " Owen asked Mr. Merrill . " You saw something , did n't you ? " Pastor Merrill asked Owen . Owen stared at him . " Did n't you ? " Mr. Merrill repeated . " I SAW MY NAME  --  ON THE GRAVE , " said Owen Meany . Dan put his arms around Owen and hugged him . " Owen , Owen  --  it 's part of the story ! You 're sick , you have a fever ! You 're too excited . Seeing a name on that grave is just like the story  --  it 's make-believe , Owen , " Dan said . " IT WAS MY NAME , " Owen said . " NOT SCROOGE'S. "  |p222The  Rev. Mr. Merrill knelt beside him . " It 's a natural thing to see that , Owen , " Mr. Merrill told him . " Your own name on your own grave  --  it 's a vision we all have . It 's just a bad dream , Owen . " But Dan Needham regarded Mr. Merrill strangely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's experience ; he was not at all sure that seeing one 's own name on one 's own grave was exactly " natural . " Mr. Fish stared at the Rev. Lewis Merrill as if he expected more " miracles " on the order of the Nativity he had only recently , and for the first time , experienced . In the baby powder on the makeup table , the name OWEN MEANY  --  as he himself had written it  --  was still visible . I pointed to it . " Owen , " I said , " look at what you wrote yourself  --  just tonight . You see , you were already thinking about it  --  your name , I mean . " But Owen Meany only stared at me ; he stared me down . Then he stared at Dan until Dan said to Mr. Fish , " Let 's get that curtain up , let 's get this over with . " Then Owen stared at the Rev. Mr. Merrill until Mr. Merrill said , " I 'll take you home right now , Owen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a temperature of the-good-Lord-knows-what . " I rode with them ; the last scene of A Christmas Carol was boring to me  --  after the departure of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , the story turns to syrup . Owen preferred staring at the darkness out the passenger-side window to the lit road ahead . " You had a vision , Owen , " Pastor Merrill repeated . I thought it was nice of him to be so concerned , and to drive Owen home  --  considering that Owen had never been a Congregationalist . I noticed that Mr. Merrill 's stutter abandoned him when he was being directly helpful to someone , although Owen responded ungenerously to the pastor 's help  --  he appeared to be sullenly embracing his " vision , " like the typically doubtless prophet he so often seemed to be , to me . He had " seen " his own name on his own grave ; the world , not to mention Pastor Merrill , would have a hard time convincing him otherwise . Mr. Merrill and I sat in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway ; there was an outside light left on for him , and another light was on  --  in what I knew was Owen 's room -- but I was shocked to see that , on Christmas Eve , his mother and father had not waited up for him ! " An unusual boy , " said the pastor neutrally , as he drove me home . Without thinking to ask me which of my two " homes " he should take me to , Mr. Merrill drove me to 80 Front Street . I wanted to attend the cast party Dan was throwing in Waterhouse Hall , but Mr. Merrill had driven off before I remembered where I wanted to he . Then I thought I might as wellp223go inside and see if my grandmother had come home , or if Dan had persuaded her to kick up her heels  --  such as she was willing  --  at the cast party . I knew the instant I opened the door that Grandmother was n't home  --  perhaps they were still having curtain calls at the Town Hall ; maybe Mr. Merrill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I breathed in the still air of the old house ; Lydia and Germaine must have been fast asleep , for even someone reading in bed makes a little noise  --  and 80 Front Street was as quiet as a grave . That was when I had the impression that it was a grave ; the house itself frightened me . I knew I was probably jumpy after Owen 's alarming " vision "  --  or whatever it was  --  and I was on the verge of leaving , and of running down Front Street to the Gravesend Academy campus ( to Dan 's dormitory ) , when I heard Germaine . She was difficult to hear because she had hidden herself in the secret passageway , and she was speaking barely above a whisper ; but the rest of the house was so very quiet , I could hear her . " Oh , Jesus , help me ! " she was saying . " Oh , God ; oh , dear Christ  --  oh , good Lord  --  help me ! " So there were thieves in Gravesend ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock the parish house . Christmas Eve bandits had pillaged 80 Front Street ! Germaine had escaped to the secret passageway , but what had the robbers done to Lydia ? Perhaps they had kidnapped her , or stolen her wheelchair and left her helpless . The books on the bookshelf-door to the secret passageway were tumbled all about  --  half of them were on the floor , as if Germaine , in her panic , had forgotten the location of the concealed lock and key . . . upon which shelf , behind which books ? She 'd made such a mess that the lock and key were now plainly visible to anyone entering the living room  --  especially since the books strewn upon the floor drew your attention to the bookshelf-door . " Germaine ? " I whispered . " Have they gone ? " " Have who gone ? " Germaine whispered back . " The robbers , " I whispered . " What robbers , " she asked me . I opened the door to the secret passageway . She was cringing behind the door , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair as adorned the relishes and chutneys and the cans of overused , spongy tennis balls that dated back to the days when my mother saved old tennis balls for Sagamore . Germaine was wearing her ankle-length flannel dressing gown ; but she was barefoot  --  suggesting that the manner of her hiding herself in the secret passageway had not been unlike the way she cleared the table . " Lydia is dead , " Germaine said . She would not emerge from the cobwebs and shadows , although I held the heavy bookshelf-door wide open for her.  | " They killed her ! " I said in alarm . " No one killed her , " Germaine said ; a certain mystical detachment flooded her eyes and caused her to slightly revise her statement . " Death just came for her , " Germaine said , shivering dramatically . She was the sort of girl who personified Death ; after all , she thought that Owen Meany 's voice was simply the speaking vehicle for the Devil . " How did she die ? " I asked . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Germaine said . " She 'd just corrected me , " Germaine said . Lydia was always correcting Germaine , naturally ; Germaine 's pronunciation was especially offensive to Lydia , who modeled her own pronunciation exactly upon my grandmother 's speech and held Germaine accountable for any failures in imitating my grandmother 's reading voice , as well . Grandmother and Lydia often took turns reading to each other  --  because their eyes , they said , needed rest . So Lydia had died while resting her eyes , informing Germaine of her mispronunciation of this or that . Occasionally , Lydia would interrupt Germaine 's reading and ask her to repeat a certain word . Whether correctly or incorrectly pronounced , Lydia would then say , " I 'll bet you do n't know what the word means , do you ? " So Lydia had died in the act of educating Germaine , a task  --  in my grandmother 's opinion  --  that had no end . Germaine had sat with the body as long as she could stand it . " Things happened to the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She viewed the spilled books with surprise  --  as if Death had come for them , too ; or perhaps Death had been looking for her and had flung the books about in the process . " What things ? " I asked . " Not nice things , " Germaine said , shaking her head . I could imagine the old house settling and creaking , groaning against the winter wind ; poor Germaine had probably concluded that Death was still around . Possibly Death had expected that coming for Lydia would have been more of a struggle ; having found her and taken her so easily , probably Death felt inclined to stay and take a second soul . Why not make a night of it ? We held hands , as if we were siblings taking a great risk together , and went to view Lydia . I was quite shocked to see her , because Germaine had not told me of the efforts she had made to shut Lydia 's mouth ; Germaine had bound Lydia 's jaws together with one of her pink leg-warmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Upon closer inspection , I saw that Germaine had also exercised considerable creativity in her efforts to permanently close Lydia 's eyes ; upon closing them , she had fastened two unmatched coins  --  a nickel and a quarter  --  to Lydia 's eyelids , with Scotch tape . She told me that the only matching coins she could find had beenp225dimes , which were too small  --  and that one eyelid fluttered , or had appeared to flutter , knocking the nickel off ; hence the tape . She used the tape on both eyelids , she explained  --  even though the quarter had stayed in place by itself  --  because to tape one coin and not the other had not appealed to her sense of symmetry . Years later , I would remember her use of that word and conclude that Lydia and my grandmother had managed to educate Germaine , a little ; " symmetry , " I was sure , was not a word in Germaine 's vocabulary before she came to live at 80 Front Street . I would remember , too , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vocabulary  --  largely through Lydia 's and my grandmother 's efforts to educate me . My mother had never paid very particular attention to words , and Dan Needham let boys be boys . When Dan returned to 80 Front Street with my grandmother , Germaine and I were much relieved ; we 'd been sitting with Lydia 's body , reassuring ourselves that Death had come and got what it came for , and gone  --  that Death had left 80 Front Street in peace , at least for the rest of Christmas Eve . But we could not have gone on sitting with Lydia for very long . As usual , Dan Needham took charge ; he 'd brought my grandmother home  --  from her brief appearance at the cast party  --  and he allowed the cast party to go on without him . He put Grandmother to bed with a rum toddy ; naturally , Owen 's outburst in A Christmas Carol had upset her  --  and now she expressed her conviction that Owen had somehow foreseen Lydia 's death and had confused it with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who remarked that while she was reading to Lydia , only shortly before Lydia died , both of them had thought they 'd heard a scream . Grandmother was insulted that Germaine should actually agree with her about anything and wanted to disassociate herself from Germaine 's hocuspocus ; it was nonsense that Lydia and Germaine could have heard Owen screaming all the way from the Gravesend Town Hall , on a windy winter night , with everyone 's doors and windows shut . Germaine was superstitious and probably heard screaming , of one kind or another , every night ; and Lydia  --  it was now clearly proven  --  was suffering from a senility much in advance of my grandmother 's . Nonetheless , in Grandmother 's view , Owen Meany had certain unlikable " powers " ; that he had " foreseen " Lydia 's death was not superstitious nonsense  --  at least not on the level that Germaine was superstitious . " Owen foresaw absolutely nothing , " Dan Needham told the agitated women . " He must have had a fever of a hundred and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination . " But against this reasoning , my grandmother and Germaine saw themselves as allies . There was  --  at the very least  --  some ominous connectionp226between Lydia 's death and what Owen " saw " ; the powers of " that boy " went far beyond the powers of the imagination . " Have another rum toddy , Harriet , " Dan Needham told my grandmother . " Do n't you patronize me , Dan , " my grandmother said . " And shame on you , " she added , " for letting a stupid butcher get his bloody hands on such a wonderful part . Dismal casting , " she told him . " I agree , I agree , " Dan said . It was also agreed that Lydia be allowed to lie in her own room , with the door firmly shut . Germaine would sleep in the other twin bed in my room . Although I much preferred the idea of returning to Waterhouse Hall with Dan , it was pointed out to me that the cast party might " rage on " into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to  --  and that Germaine , who was " in a state , " should not be left in a room alone . It would be quite improper for her to share a room with Dan , and unthinkable that my grandmother would sleep in the same room with a maid . After all , I was only eleven . I had shared that room so many times with Owen ; how I wanted to talk to him now ! What would he think of my grandmother 's suggestion that he had foreseen Lydia 's death ? And would he be relieved to learn that Death did n't have a plan to come for him ? Would he believe it ? I knew he would be deeply disappointed if he missed seeing Lydia . And I wanted to tell him about my discovery  --  while watching the theater audience  --  that I believed I could , by this means , actually remember the faces in the audience at what Owen called that FATED baseball game . What would Owen Meany say about my sudden inspiration : that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the split second before the ball hit her ? In the world of what the Rev. Lewis Merrill called " visions , " what would Owen make of that one ? But Germaine distracted me . She wanted the night-light left on ; she tossed and turned ; she lay staring at the ceiling . When I got up to go to the bathroom , she asked me not to be gone long ; she did n't want to be left alone  --  not for a minute . If she would only fall asleep , I thought , I could telephone Owen . There was only one phone in the Meany house ; it was in the kitchen , right outside Owen 's bedroom . I could call him at any hour of the night , because he woke up in an instant and his parents slept through the night like boulders  --  like immovable slabs of granite . Then I remembered it was Christmas Eve . My mother had once said it was " just as well " that we went to Sawyer Depot for Christmas , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I got.  |p227I  got a half-dozen presents from each relative or loved one  --  from my grandmother , from my aunt and uncle , from my cousins , from Dan ; and more than a half-dozen from my mother . I had looked under the Christmas tree this year , in the living room of 80 Front Street , and was touched at Dan 's and my grandmother 's efforts to match the sheer number of presents  --  for me  --  that usually lay under the Eastmans ' tree in Sawyer Depot . I had already counted them ; I had over forty wrapped presents  --  and , God knows , there was usually something hidden in the basement or in the garage that was too big to wrap . I never knew what Owen got for Christmas , but it occurred to me that if his parents had n't even waited up for him  --  on Christmas Eve !  --  that Christmas was not especially emphasized in the Meany household . In the past , by the time I came back from Sawyer Depot , half of my lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were truly worth keeping were discovered  --  by Owen  --  gradually , over a period of days or weeks . " WHERE 'D YOU GET THAT ? " " For Christmas . " " OH , YES , I SEE ... " Now that I thought of it , I could not remember him ever showing me a single thing he got " for Christmas . " I wanted to call him , but Germaine kept me in my bed . The more I stayed in my bed , and the more I was aware of her  --  still awake  --  the stranger I began to feel . I began to think about Germaine the way I often thought about Hester  --  and how old would Germaine have been in ' 53 ? In her twenties , I suppose . I actually began to wish that she would climb into my bed , and I began to imagine climbing into hers ; I do n't think she would have prevented me  --  I think she would have favored an innocent hug and even a not-so-innocent boy in her arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme  --  not at all in the manner of an eleven-year-old , but in the manner of an older , horny boy . I began to imagine how much advantage I might take of Germaine , given that she was distraught . I actually said , " I believe you , about hearing him scream . " I lied ! I did n't believe her at all ! " It was his voice , " she said instantly . " Now that I remember it , I know it was . " I reached out my hand , into the aisle between the twin beds ; her hand was there to take mine . I thought about the way Barb Wiggin had kissed Owen ; I was rewarded with an erection powerful enough to slightly raise my bed covers ; but when I squeezed Germaine 's hand especially hard , she made no response  --  she just held on . " Go to sleep , " she said . When her hand slipped out of mine , I realized that she had fallen asleep ; I stared at her for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ashamed of how I felt . In the considerably grown-up vocabulary that I had been exposed to through my grandmother and Lydia , I had not been exposed to lust ; that was not a word I could have learned from them  --  that was not a feeling I could label . What I was experiencing simply felt wrong ; it made me feel guilty , that a part of myself was an enemy to the rest of myself , and that was when I thought I understood where the feeling came from ; it had to come from my father . It was the part of him that stirred inside me . And for the first time , I began to consider that my father might be evil , or that what of himself he had given to me was what was evil in me . Henceforward , whenever I was troubled by a way I felt  --  and especially when I felt this way , when I lusted  --  I thought that my father was asserting himself within me . My desire to know who he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know who he was because I missed him , or because I was looking for someone to love ; I had Dan and his love ; I had my grandmother  --  and everything I remembered , and ( I 'm sure ) exaggerated , about my mother . It was not out of love that I wanted to meet my father , but out of the darkest curiosity  --  to be able to recognize , in myself , what evil I might be capable of . How I wanted to talk to Owen about this ! When Germaine started to snore , I got out of bed and crept downstairs to the kitchen phone to call him . The sudden light in the kitchen sent a resident mouse into rapid abandonment of its investigations of the bread box ; the light also surprised me , because it turned the myriad Colonial-style windowpanes into fragmentedmirror images of myself  --  there instantly appeared to be many of me , standing outside the house , looking in at me . In one image of my shocked face I thought I recognized the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Morrison 's response to Owen 's fainting spell and fit had been one of shock  --  the cowardly mailman had fainted . Chief Pike had carried the fallen postal thespian into the bracing night air , where Mr. Morrison had revived with a vengeance  --  wrestling in the snow with Gravesend 's determined chief of police , until Mr. Morrison yielded to the strong arm of the law . But I was alone in the kitchen ; the small , square , mirror-black panes reflected many versions of my face , but no other face looked in upon me as I dialed the Meanys ' number . It rang longer than I expected , and I almost hung up . Remembering Owen 's fever , I was afraid he might he more soundly asleep than usual  --  and that Mr. and Mrs. Meany would he awakened by my call . " MERRY CHRISTMAS , " he said , when he finally answered the phone . I told him everything . He was most sympathetic to the notion that I could " remember " the audience at the baseball game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended that he watch with me  --  two pairs of eyes being better than one . As for my " imagining " that my mother had been waving to my actual father in the last seconds she was alive , Owen Meany believed in trusting such instincts ; he said that 1 must be ON THE RIGHT TRACK , because the idea gave him THE SHIVERS  --  a sure sign . And as for my desire for Germaine giving me a hard-on , Owen could n't have been more supportive ; if Barb Wiggin could provoke lust in him , there was no shame in Germaine provoking such dreadful feelings in me . Owen had prepared a small sermon on the subject of lust , a feeling he would later describe as A TRUTHFUL PREMONITION THAT DAMNATION IS FOR REAL . As for the unpleasant sensation orginating with my father -- as for these hated feelings in myself being a first sign of my father 's contribution to me  --  Owen was in complete agreement . Lust , he would later say , was God 's way of helping me identify who my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust would I discover my father . It is amazing to me , now , how such wild imaginings and philosophies  --  inspired by a night charged with frights and calamities  --  made such perfectly good sense to Owen Meany and me ; but good friends are nothing to each other if they are not supportive . Of course , he agreed with me  --  how stupid Germaine was , to imagine she 'd heard him screaming , all the way from the Gravesend Town Hall ! " I DID N'T SCREAM THAT LOUDLY , " he said indignantly . It was Grandmother 's interpretation of what he had foreseen that provided the only difference of opinion between us . If he had to believe anything , why could n't he believe Grandmother  --  that it was Lydia 's death that the gravestoneforetold ; that Owen had simply " seen " the wrong name ? " NO , " he said . " IT WAS MY NAME . NOT SCROOGE 'S  --  AND NOT LYDIA 'S . " " But that was just your mistake , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing your own name , just moments before . And you had a very high fever . If that gravestone actually told you anything , it told you that someone was going to die . That someone was Lydia . She 's dead , is n't she ? And you 're not dead  --  are you ? " " IT WAS MY NAME , " he repeated stubbornly . " Look at it this way : you got it half-right , " I told him . I was trying to sound as if I were an old hand at " visions , " and at interpreting them . I tried to sound as if I knew more about the matter than Pastor Merrill . " IT WAS N'T JUST MY NAME , " Owen said . " I MEAN , NOT THE WAY I EVER WRITE IT  --  NOT THE WAY I WROTE IT IN THE BABY POWDER . IT WAS MY REAL NAME  --  IT SAID THE WHOLE THING " he said.  |p230That  made me pause ; he sounded so unbudging . His " real " name was Paul  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. Meany , Jr. ; he 'd been baptized a Catholic . Of course , he needed a saint 's name , like St. Paul ; if there is a St. Owen , I 've never heard of him . And because there was already a " Paul " in the family , I suppose that 's why they called him " Owen " ; where that middle name came from , he never said  --  I never knew . " The gravestone said , Paul O. Meany , Junior '  --  is that right ? " I asked him . " IT SAID THE WHOLE THING , " Owen repeated . He hung up . He was so crazy , he drove me crazy ! I stayed up drinking orange juice and eating cookies ; I put some fresh bacon in the mousetrap and turned out the light . Like my mother , I hate darkness ; in the dark , it came to me  --  what he meant by THE WHOLE THING . I turned on the light ; I called him back . " MERRY CHRISTMAS , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravestone ? " I asked him . He gave himself away by hesitating . " NO , " he said . " What was the date , Owen ? " I asked him . He hesitated again . " THERE WAS NO DATE , " Owen said . I wanted to cry  --  not because I believed a single thing about his stupid " vision , " but because it was the first time he had lied to me . " Merry Christmas , " I said ; I hung up . When I turned the light out a second time , there was more darkness in the darkness . What was the date ? How much time had he given himself ? The only question that I wanted to ask the darkness was the one question Scrooge had also wanted an answer to : " Are these the shadows of the things that Will be or are they shadows of the things that May be , only ? ' " But the Ghost of the Future was not answering.  |p231Above  all things that she despised , what my grandmother loathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a peculiar hatred , because Harriet Wheelwright had never worked a day in her life  --  nor had she ever expected my mother to work ; and she never once assigned me a single chore . Nevertheless , in my grandmother 's view , it required nearly constant effort to keep track of the world  --  both our own world and the world outside the sphere of Gravesend  --  and it required effort and intelligence to make nearly constant comment on one 's observations ; in these efforts , Grandmother was rigorous and unswerving . It was her belief in the value of effort itself that prevented her from buying a television set . She was a passionate reader , and she thought that reading was one of the noblest efforts of all ; in contrast , she found writing to be a great waste of time  --  a childish self-indulgence , even messier than finger painting  --  but she admired reading , which she believed was an unselfish activity that provided information and inspiration . She must have thought it a pity that some poor fools had to waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading material . Reading also gave one confidence in and familiarity with language , which was a necessary tool for forming thosep232nearly constant comments on what one had observed . Grandmother had her doubts about the radio , although she conceded that the modern world moved at such a pace that keeping up with it defied the written word ; listening , after all , required some effort , and the language one heard on the radio was not much worse than the language one increasingly stumbled over in newspapers and magazines . But she drew the line at television . It took no effort to watch  --  it was infinitely more beneficial to the soul , and to the intelligence , to read or to listen  --  and what she imagined there was to watch on TV appalled her ; she had , of course , only read about it . She had protested to the Soldiers ' Home , and to the Gravesend Retreat for the Elderly  --  both of which she served as a trustee  --  that making television sets available to old people would surely hasten their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both these homes for the aged : that the inmates were often too feeble or inattentive to read , and that the radio put them to sleep . My grandmother visited both homes , and what she observed only confirmed her opinions ; what Harriet Wheelwright always observed always confirmed her opinions : she saw the process of death hastened . She saw very old , infirm people with their mouths agape ; although they were , at best , only partially alert , they gave their stuporous attention to images that my grandmother described as " too surpassing in banality to recall . " It was the first time she had actually seen television sets that were turned on , and she was hooked . My grandmother observed that television was draining what scant life remained in the old people " clean out of them " ; yet she instantly craved a TV of her own ! My mother 's death , which was followed in less than a year by Lydia 's death , had much to do with Grandmother 's decision to have a television installed at 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Victrola ; in the evenings , we 'd listened to Sinatra singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra  --  my mother liked to sing along with Sinatra . " That Frank , " she used to say . " He 's got a voice that 's meant for a woman  --  but no woman was ever that lucky . " I remember a few of her favorites ; when I hear them , I 'm still tempted to sing along  --  although I do n't have my mother 's voice . I do n't have Sinatra 's voice , either  --  nor his bullying patriotism . I do n't think my mother would have been fond of Sinatra 's politics , but she liked what she called his " early " voice , in particular those songs from Sinatra 's first sessions with Tommy Dorsey . Because she liked to sing along with Sinatra , she preferred his voice before the war  --  when he was more subdued and less of a star , when Tommy Dorsey kept him in balance with the band . Her favorite recordings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fools Rush In , " " I Have n't Time to Be a Millionaire , " " It 's a Lovely Day Tomorrow , " " All This and Heaven , Too , " " Wherep233Do You Keep Your Heart ? " " Trade Winds , " " The Call of the Canyon " ; and , most of all , " Too Romantic . " I had my own radio , and after Mother died , I listened to it more and more ; I thought it would upset my grandmother to play  --  on the Victrolathoseold Sinatra songs . When Lydia was alive , my grandmother seemed content with her reading ; either she and Lydia took turns reading to each other , or they forced Germaine to read aloud to them  --  while they rested their eyes and exercised their acute interest in educating Germaine . But after Lydia died , Germaine refused to read aloud to my grandmother ; Germaine was convinced that her reading aloud to Lydia had either killed Lydia or had hastened her death , and Germaine was resolute in not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , my grandmother read aloud to Germaine ; but this afforded no opportunity for Grandmother to rest her eyes , and she would often interrupt her reading to make sure that Germaine was paying proper attention . Germaine could not possibly pay attention to the subject  --  she was so intent on keeping herself alive for the duration of the reading . You can see that this was a home already vulnerable to invasion by television . Ethel , for example , would never be the companion to my grandmother that Lydia had been . Lydia had been an alert and appreciative audience to my grandmother 's nearly constant comments , but Ethel was entirely unresponsive  --  efficient but uninspired , dutiful but passive . Dan Needham sensed that it was Ethel 's lack of spark that made my grandmother feel old ; yet whenever Dan suggested to Grandmother that she might replace Ethel with someone livelier , my grandmother defended Ethel with bulldog loyalty . Wheelwrights were snobs but they were fair-minded ; Wheelwrights did not fire their servants because they were stodgy and dull . And so Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless to be entertained ; she was vulnerable to invasion by television , too . Germaine , who was terrified when my grandmother read to her  --  and too terrified to read aloud to Grandmother at all  --  had too little to do ; she resigned . Wheelwrights accept resignations graciously , although I was sorry to see Germaine go . The desire she had provoked in me  --  as distasteful as it was to me at the time  --  was a clue to my father ; moreover , the lustful fantasies that Germaine provided were , although evil , more entertaining to me than anything I could hear on my raido . With Lydia gone , and with me spending half my days and nights with Dan , Grandmother did n't need two maids ; there was no reason to replace Germaine -- Ethel would suffice . And with Germaine gone , I was vulnerable to invasion by television , too . " YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS GE'I " PING A TELEVISION ' ? " saidp234Owen Meany . The Meanys did not have a television . Dan did n't have one , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd promised himself that he would n't buy a TV as long as Ike was president . Even the Eastmans did n't have a television . Uncle Alfred wanted one , and Noah and Simon and Hester begged to have one ; but TV reception was still rather primitive in the north country , Sawyer Depot received mostly snow , and Aunt Martha refused to build a tower for the necessary antenna  --  it would be too " unsightly , " she said , although Uncle Alfred wanted a television so badly that he claimed he would construct an antenna tower capable of interfering with low-flying planes if it could get him adequate reception . " You 're getting a television ? " Hester said to me on the phone from Sawyer Depot . " You lucky little prick ! " Her jealousy was thrilling to hear . Owen and I had no idea what would be on television . We were used to the Saturday matinees at the decrepit Gravesend movie house , inexplicably called The Idaho  --  after the faraway western state or the potato of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tarzan films , andincreasingly  --  tobiblical epics . Owen and I hated the latter : in his view , they were SACRILEGIOUS ; in my opinion , they were boring . Owen was also critical of Tarzan movies . " ALL THAT STUPID SWINGING ON VINES  --  AND THE VINES NEVER BREAK . AND EVERY TIME HE GOES SWIMMING , THEY SEND IN THE ALLIGATORS OR THE CROCODILES  --  ACTUALLY , I THINK IT 'S ALWAYS THE SAME ALLIGATOR OR CROCODILE ; THE POOR CREATURE IS TRAINED TO WRESTLE WITH TARZAN . IT PROBABLY LOVES TARZAN ! AND IT 'S ALWAYS THE SAME OLD ELEPHANT STAMPEDING  --  AND THE SAME LION , THE SAME LEOPARD , THE SAME STUPID WARTHOG ! AND HOW CAN JANE STAND HIM ? HE 'S SO STUPID ; ALL THESE YEARS HE 'S BEEN MARRIED TO JANE , AND HE STILL CA N'T SPEAK ENGLISH . THE STUPID CHIMPANZEE IS SMARTER , " Owen said . But what really made him cross were the Pygmies ; they gave him THE SHIVERS . He wondered if the Pygmies got jobs in other movies ; he worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular with JUVENILE GANGS . " Where ? " I asked . " What juvenile gangs ? " " MAYBE THEY 'RE IN BOSTON , " he said . We had no idea what to expect from Grandmother 's television . There may have been Pygmy movies on The Late Show in 1954 , but Owen and I were not allowed to watch The Late Show for several years ; my grandmother  --  for all her love of effort and regulation  --  imposed no other rules about television upon us . For all I know , there may not have been a Late Show as long ago as 1954 ; it does n't matter . The point is , myp235grandmother was never a censor ; she simply believed that Owen and I should go to bed at a " decent " hour . She watched television all day , and every evening ; at dinner , she would recount the day 's inanities to me  --  or to Owen , or Dan , or even Ethel  --  and she would offer a hasty preview of the absurdities available for nighttime viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to television ; on the other hand , she expressed her contempt for nearly everything she saw and the energy of her outrage may have added years to her life . She detested TV with such passion and wit that watching television and commenting on it  --  sometimes , commenting directly to it  --  became her job . There was no manifestation of contemporary culture that did not indicate to my grandmother how steadfast was the nation 's decline , how merciless our mental and moral deterioration , how swiftly all-embracing our final decadence . I never saw her read a book again ; but she referred to books often  --  as if they were shrines and cathedrals of learning that television had plundered and then abandoned . There was much on television that Owen and I were unprepared for ; but what we were most unprepared for was my grandmother 's active participation in almost everything we saw . On those rare occasions when we watched television without my grandmother , we were disappointed ; without Grandmother 's running , scathing commentary , there were few programs that could sustain our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always say , " I CAN JUST HEAR WHAT YOUR GRANDMOTHER WOULD MAKE OF THIS . " Of course , there is no heart  --  however serious  --  that finds the death of culture entirely lacking in entertainment ; even my grandmother enjoyed one particular television show . To my surprise , Grandmother and Owen were devoted viewers of the same show  --  in my grandmother 's case , it was the only show for which she felt uncritical love ; in Owen 's case , it was his favorite among the few shows he at first adored . The unlikely figure who captured the rarely uncritical hearts of my grandmother and Owen Meany was a shameless crowd pleaser , a musical panderer who chopped up Chopin and Mozart and Debussy into two- and three-minute exaggerated flourishes on a piano he played with diamondstuddedhands . He at times played a see-through , glass-topped piano , and he was proud of mentioning the hundreds of thousands of dollars that his pianos cost ; one of his diamond rings was piano-shaped , and he never played any piano that was not adorned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was an idol  --  largely to women older than my grandmother , and of less than half her education ; yet my grandmother and Owen Meany loved him . Ilc 'd once appeared as a soloist for the Chicago Symphony , when he was only fourteen , but now  --  in his wavy-hairedp236thirties  --  he was a man who was more dedicated to the visual than to the acoustic . He wore floor-length furs and sequined suits ; he crammed sixty thousand dollars ' worth of chinchilla onto one coat ; he had a jacket of twenty-four-karat gold braid ; he wore a tuxedo with diamond buttons that spelled out his name . " LIBERACE ! " Owen cried , every time he saw the man ; his TV show appeared ten times a week . He was a ridiculous peacock of a man with a honey-coated , feminine voice and dimples so deep that they might have been the handiwork of a ball peen hammer . " Why do n't I slip out and get into something more spectacular ? " he would coo ; each time , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return to his piano , having changed his sequins for feathers . Liberace was an androgynous pioneer , I suppose  --  preparing the society for freaks like Elton John and Boy George  --  but I could never understand why Owen and Grandmother liked him . It certainly was n't his music , for he edited Mozart in such a jaunty fashion that you thought he was playing " Mack the Knife " ; now and then he played " Mack the Knife , " too . " He loves his mother , " my grandmother would say , in Liberace 's defense  --  and , in truth , it seemed to be true ; not only did he ooh and aah about his mother on TV , but it was reported that he actually lived with the old lady until she died  --  in 1980 ! " HE GAVE HIS BROTHER A JOB , " Owen pointed out , " AND I DO N'T THINK GEORGE IS ESPECIALLY TALENTED . " Indeed , George , the silent brother , played a straight-man 's violin until he left the act to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he died  --  in 1983 . But where did Owen get the idea that Liberace was ESPECIALLY TALENTED ? To me , his principal gift was how unselfconsciouslyhe amused himself  --  and he was capable of making fun of himself , too . But my grandmother and Owen Meany twittered over him as hysterically as the blue-haired ladies in Liberace 's TV audience did  --  especially when the famous fool skipped into the audience to dance with them ! " He actually likes old people ! " my grandmother said in wonder . " HE WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE ! " said Owen Meany admiringly . At the time , I thought he was a fruitcake , but a London columnist who made a similar slur regarding Liberace 's sexual preferences lost a libel judgment to him . ( That was in 1959 ; on the witness stand , Liberace testified that he was opposed to homosexuality . I remember how Owen and my grandmother cheered ! ) And so , in 1954 , my excitement over the new television at t ( 1 Frontp237Street was tempered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt quite excluded from their mindless worship of such a kitschy phenomenon  --  my mother would never have sung along with Liberace !  --  and I expressed my criticism , as always , to Dan . Dan Needham took a creative , often a positive view of misfortune ; many faculty members in even the better secondary schools are failures-inhiding  --  lazymen and women whose marginal authority can be exercised only over adolescents ; but Dan was never one of these . Whether he hoped to retire at Gravesend Academy when he first fell in love and married my mother , I 'll never know ; but her loss , and his reaction to that injustice , caused him to devote himself to the development of the education of " the whole boy " in ways that surpassed even the loftily expressed goals in Gravesend 's curriculum  --  where " the whole boy " was the proposed result of the four-year program of study . Dan became the best of those faculty found at a prep school : he was not only a spirited , good teacher , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was more difficult to be a teenager than a grown-up  --  an opinion not widely held among grown-ups , and rarely held among the faculty members at a private school ( who more frequently look upon their charges as the privileged louts of the luxury class  --  spoiled brats in need of discipline ) . Dan Needham , although he encountered at Gravesend Academy many spoiled brats in need of discipline , simply had more sympathy for people under twenty than he had for people his own age , and older  --  although he increased his sympathy for the elderly , who ( he believed ) were suffering a second adolescence and ( like the boys at Gravesend ) required special care . " Your grandmother is getting old , " Dan told me . " She 's suffered losses  --  her husband , your mother . And Lydia  --  although neither your grandmother nor Lydia knew it  --  was possibly your grandmother 's closest friend . Ethel is no better company than a fire hydrant . If your grandmother loves Liberace , do n't fault her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone makes her happy , do n't complain , " Dan said . But if it was tolerable to be Grandmother 's age and adore Liberace , it was intolerable that Owen Meany should also love that simpering , piano-key smile . " I 'm sick of how smart Owen thinks he is , " I said to Dan . " If he 's so smart , how can he like Liberace  --  at his age ? " " Owen is smart , " Dan said . " He 's smarter than even he knows . But he is not worldly , " Dan added . " God knows  --  in his family  --  what terrible superstitions he 's grown up with ! His father is an uneducated mystery , and no one knows the measure of his mother 's mental problems  --  she 's in such a lunatic state , we ca n't even guess how insane she is ! Maybe Owen likes Liberare because Liberace could n't exist in Gravesend . Why does he thinkp238he 'd be so happy in Sawyer Depot ? " Dan asked me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan was right ; but Dan 's theories about Owen were always a little too complete . When I told Dan that Owen remained convinced he had seen the exact date of his own death  --  and that he refused to tell me what the special day was  --  Dan too neatly put that problem to rest along with the superstitions Owen 's parents had subjected him to ; I could n't help thinking that Owen was more creative , and more responsible , than that . And if Dan was one of the gifted and tirelessly unselfish faculty members at the academy , his sincere devotion to the goal of " the whole boy " may have blinded him to the faults of the school  --  and especially to the many flawed members of the faculty and the administration . Dan believed that Gravesend Academy could rescue anyone . All that Owen needed was to survive until he was old enough to enter the academy . Owen 's naturally good mind would mature when confronted with the academic challenges ; Owen 's superstitions would vanish in the company of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan Needham had made education his religion ; Owen Meany lacked only the social and intellectual stimulation that a good school could provide . At Gravesend Academy , Dan was sure , the brute-stupid influence of Owen 's parents would be washed clean away  --  as cleanly as the ocean at Little Boar 's Head could wash the quarry dust from Owen 's body . My Aunt Martha and Uncle Alfred could n't wait for Noah and Simon to be old enough to attend Gravesend Academy . The Eastmans , like Dan , believed in the powers of a good private-school education  --  specifically , in the case of Noah and Simon , in the power to rescue those two daredevils from the standard fates of rural , north country boys : the marriage of driving fast on the back roads , and beer ; and the trailer-park girls in the back seats of those cars , those girls who successfully conspired to get pregnant before their high-school graduations . Like many boys who are sent off to private schools , my cousins Noah and Simon had a wildness within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their communities ; they had dangerous edges in need of blunting . Everyone suspected that the rigors of a good school would have the desired , dulling effect on Noah and Simon  --  Gravesend Academy would assault them with a host of new demands , of impossible standards . The sheer volume ( if not the value ) of the homework would tire them out , and everyone knew that tired boys were safer boys ; the numbing routine , the strict attentions paid to the dress code , the regulations regarding only the most occasional and highly chaperoned encounters with the female sex . . . all this would certainly civilize them . Why my Auntp239Martha and Uncle Alfred were less concerned with civilizing Hester remains a mystery to me . That Gravesend Academy did not admit girls , in those days , should not have influenced the Eastmans ' decision to send or not to send Hester off to a private school ; there were plenty of private schools for girls , and Hester was in as much need of rescuing from the wildness within her  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as Noah and Simon were in need of saving . But in this interim period of time  --  when Noah and Simon and Owen and I were all waiting to be old enough to attend the academy  --  Hester began to resent that there were no plans being made for her salvation . The idea that she was not in need of rescuing would surely have insulted her ; and the notion that my aunt and uncle might have considered her beyond saving would have hurt her in another way . " EITHER WAY , " said Owen Meany , " THAT 'S WHEN HESTER WENT ON THE WARPATH . " " What warpath ? " Grandmother asked Owen ; but Owen and I were careful not to discuss Hester with my grandmother . A new bond had developed between Owen and Grandmother because of Liberace ; they also watched lots of old movies together and encouraged each other 's constant comments . It was Grandmother 's appreciation of Owen 's commentary , which was as ripe with complaint as her own , that enlisted my grandmother 's support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you mean , you think you might not ' go to the academy ? " she asked him . " WELL , I KNOW I 'LL GET IN  --  AND I KNOW I 'LL GET A FULL SCHOLARSHIP , TOO , " Owen said . " Of course you will ! " my grandmother said . " BUT I DO N'T HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF CLOTHES , " Owen said . " ALL THOSE COATS AND TIES , AND DRESS SHIRTS , AND SHOES . " " Do you mean , they do n't make them in your size ? " Grandmother asked him . " Nonsense ! One just has to go shopping in the right places . " " I MEAN MY PARENTS CA N'T AFFORD THOSE KIND OF CLOTHES , " Owen said . We were watching an old Alan Ladd movie on The Early Show . It was called Appointment with Danger , and Owen thought it was ridiculous that all the men in Gary , Indiana , wore suits and hats . " They used to wear them here , " my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Meany Granite Quarry . Jack Webb , before he was the good cop in Dragnet , was a had guy inp240Appointment with Danger ; he was , among his other endeavors , attempting to murder a nun . This gave Owen the shivers . The movie gave my grandmother the shivers , too , because she recalled that she had seen it at The Idaho in 1951  --  with my mother . " The nun will be all right , Owen , " she told him . " IT 'S NOT THE IDEA OF MURDERING HER THAT GIVES ME THE SHIVERS , " Owen explained . " IT 'S THE IDEA OF NUNS  --  IN GENERAL . " " I know what you mean , " my grandmother said ; she harbored her own misgivings about the Catholics . " WHAT WOULD IT COST TO HAVE A COUPLE OF SUITS AND A COUPLE OF JACKETS AND A COUPLE OF PAIRS OF DRESS PANTS , AND SHIRTS , AND TIES , AND SHOES  --  YOU KNOW , THE WORKS ? " Owen asked . " I 'm going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You let me worry about what it will cost . Nobody needs to know what it costs . " " MAYBE , IN MY SIZE , IT 'S NOT SO EXPENSIVE , " Owen said . And so  --  even without my mother alive to urge him  --  Owen Meany agreed that he was Gravesend Academy " material . " The academy agreed , too . Even without Dan Needham 's recommendation , they would have admitted Owen with a full scholarship ; he was obviously in need of a scholarship , and he had all A 's at Gravesend Junior High School . The problem was  --  though Dan Needham had legally adopted me , and I therefore had the privileged status of a faculty son  --  the academy was reluctant to accept me . My junior-high-school performance was so undistinguishedthat the academy admissions officers advised Dan to have me attend the ninth grade at Gravesend High School ; the academy would admit me to their ninth-grade class the following year  --  when , they said , it would be easier for me to make the adjustment because I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a weak student ; this was less a blow to my self-esteem than it was painful for me to think of Owen moving ahead of me  --  we would n't be in the same class , we would n't graduate together . There was another , more practical consideration : that , in my senior year , I would n't have Owen around to help me with my homework . That was a promise Owen had made to my mother : that he would always help me with my homework . And so , before Grandmother took Owen shopping for his academy clothes , Owen announced his decision to attend the ninth grade at Gravesend High School , too . He would stay with me ; he would enter the academy the following year  --  he could have skipped a grade . yet he volunteered to repeat the ninth grade with mc ! l ) an convinced thep241admissions officers that although Owen was academically quite advanced , it would also be good for him to repeat a grade , to be a year older as a ninth grader  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the admissions officers met Owen , of course they agreed with Dan  --  they did n't know that a year older , in Owen 's case , did n't mean that he 'd be a year bigger . Dan and my grandmother were quite touched by Owen 's loyalty to me ; Hester , naturally , denounced Owen 's behavior as " queer " ; naturally , I loved him , and I thanked him for his sacrifice  --  but in my heart I resented his power over me . " DO N'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT , " he said . " WE 'RE PALS , ARE N'T WE ? WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR ? I 'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU . " Toronto : February 5 , 1987  --  Liberace died yesterday ; he was sixtyseven . His fans had been maintaining a candlelit vigil outside his Palm Springs mansion , which was formerly a convent . Would n't that have given Owen the shivers ? Liberace had revised his former opposition to homosexuality . " If you swing with chickens , that is your perfect right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1982 palimony suit that he had paid for the sexual services of a male employee  --  a former valet and live-in chauffeur . There was a settlement out of court . And Liberace 's manager denied that the entertainer was a victim of AIDS ; Liberace 's recent weight loss was the result , the manager said , of a watermelon-only diet . What would my grandmother and Owen Meany have said about that ? " LIBERACE ! " Owen would have cried . " WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVEDIT POSSIBLE ? LIBERACE ! KILLED BY WATERMELONS ! " It was Thanksgiving , 1954 , before my cousins visited Gravesend and saw Grandmother 's TV at 80 Front Street for themselves . Noah had started at the academy that fall , so he 'd watched television with Owen and me on occasional weekends ; but no judgment on the culture around us could ever be complete without Simon 's automatic approval of every conceivable form of entertainment , and Hester 's similarly automatic disapproval . " Neat ! " Simon said ; he also thought that Liberace was " neat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hester . " Until everything 's in color , and the color 's perfect , TV 's not worth watching . " But Hester was impressed by the energy of Grandmother 's constant criticism of nearly everything she saw ; that was a style Hester sought to imitate  --  for even " shit " was worth watching if it afforded one the opportunity to elaborate on what sort of shit it was . Everyone agreed that the movie reruns were more interesting than thep242actual TV programs ; yet in Hester 's view , the movies selected were " too old . " Grandmother liked them old  --  " the older the better ! "  --  but she disliked most movie stars . After watching Captain Blood , she announced that Errol Flynn was " no brains , all chest " ; Hester thought that Olivia de Havilland was " cow-eyed . " Owen suggested that pirate movies were all the same . " STUPID SWORD FIGHTS ! " he said . " AND LOOK AT THE CLOTHES THEY WEAR ! IF YOU 'RE GOING TO BE FIGHTING WITH SWORDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  OF COURSE YOUR SHIRTS ARE GOING TO GET ALL SLASHED TO PIECES ! " Grandmother complained that the choice of movies was n't even " seasonal . " What was the point of showing It Happens Every Spring in November ? No one is thinking about baseball at Thanksgiving , and It Happens Every Spring is such a stupid baseball movie that I think I could watch it every night and even fail to be reminded of my mother 's death . Ray Milland is a college professor who becomes a phenomenal baseball player after discovering a formula that repels wood ; how could this remind anyone of anything real ? " Honestly , who thinks up these things ? " Grandmother asked . " Peckerheads , " said Hester , who was forever expanding her vocabulary . If Gravesend Academy had begun the process of saving Noah from himself , we could scarcely tell ; it was Simon who seemed subdued , perhaps because he had missed Noah during the fall and was overwhelmed by the instant renewal of their athletic rivalry . Noah was experiencing considerable academic difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-to-heart talks with Uncle Alfred and Aunt Martha . The Eastmans decided that Noah was intellectually exhausted ; the family would spend that Christmas holiday on some recuperative beach in the Caribbean . " IN THE RELAXING SETTING OF CAPTAIN BLOOD ! " Owen observed . Owen was disappointed that the Eastmans were spending Christmas in the Caribbean ; another opportunity to go to Sawyer Depot had eluded him . After Thanksgiving , he was depressed ; and  --  like me  --  he was thinking about Hester . We went to The Idaho for the usual fare at the Saturday matinee  --  a double feature : Treasure of the Golden Condor , wherein Cornel Wilde is a dashing eighteenth-century Frenchman seeking hidden Mayan riches in Guatemala ; and Drum Beat , wherein Alan Ladd is a cowboy and Audrey Dalton is an Indian . Between tales of ancient treasure and scalping parties , it was repeatedly clear to Owen and me that we lived in a dull age -- that adventure always happened elsewhere , and long ago . Tarzan tit this formula  --  and so did the dreaded biblical epics . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newly sullen and withdrawn persona that Owen presented to the world at Christ Church . That the Wiggins had actually liked The Robe made up Owen 's mind : whether he ever got to go to Sawyer Depot for Christmas or not , he would never participate in another Nativity . I 'm sure his decision did not upset the Wiggins greatly , but Owen was unforgiving on the subject of biblical epics in general and The Robe in particular . Although he thought that Jean Simmons was " PRETTY , LIKE HESTER , " he also thought that Audrey Dalton  --  in Drum Beat  --  was " LIKE HESTER IF HESTER HAD BEEN AN INDIAN . " Beyond all three having dark hair , I failed to see any resemblance . The Robe , to be fair , had hit Owen and me one Saturday afternoon at The Idaho with special force ; my mother had been dead less than a year , and Owen and I were not comforted to see Richard Burton and Jean Simmons walk off to their deaths quite so happily . Furthermore , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the sky ! This was especially offensive . Richard Burton is a Roman tribune who converts to Christianity after crucifying Christ ; both Burton and Jean Simmons take turns clutching Christ 's robe a lot . " WHAT A BIG FUSS ABOUT A BLANKET ! " Owen said . " THAT 'S SO CATHOLIC , " he added  --  " TO GET VERY RELIGIOUS ABOUT OBJECTS . " This was a theme of Owen 's  --  the Catholics and their adoration of OBJECTS . Yet Owen 's habit of collecting objects that he made ( in his own way ) RELIGIOUS was well known : I had only to remember my armadillo 's claws . In all of Gravesend , the object that most attracted Owen 's contempt was the stone statue of Mary Magdalene , the reformed prostitute who guarded the playground of St. Michael 's  --  the parochial school . The life-sized statue stood in a meaningless cement archway  --  " meaningless " because the archway led nowhere ; it was a gate without a place to be admitted to ; it was an entrance without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked the rutted macadam playground of the schoolyard  --  a surface too broken up to dribble a basketball on ; the bent and rusted basket hoops had long ago been stripped of their nets , and the foul lines had been erased or worn away with sand . It was a forlornly unattended playground on weekends and school holidays ; it was used strictly for recesses during school days , when the parochial students loitered there  --  they were unmoved to play many games . The stern look of Mary Magdalene rebuked them ; her former line of work and her harsh reformation shamed them . For although the playground reflected an obdurate disrepair , the statue itself was whitewashed everyp244spring , and even on the dullest , grayest days  --  despite being dotted here and there with birdshit and occasional stains of human desecration  --  Mary Magdalene attracted and reflected more light than any other object or human presence at St. Michael 's . Owen looked upon the school as a prison to which he was nearly sent ; for had his parents not RENOUNCED the Catholics , St. Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altogether bleak , reformatory atmosphere ; its life was punctuated by the sounds of an adjacent gas station  --  the bell that announced the arriving and departing vehicles , the accounting of the gas pumps themselves , and the multifarious din from the mechanics laboring in the pits . But over this unholy , unstudious , unsuitable ground the stone Mary Magdalene stood her guard ; under her odd , cement archway , she at times appeared to be tending to an elaborate but crudely homemade barbecue ; at other times , she seemed to be a goalie  --  poised in the goal . Of course , no Catholic would have fired a ball or a puck or any other missile at her ; if the parochial students themselves were tempted , the grim , alert presence of the nuns would have discouraged them . And although the Gravesend Catholic Church was in another part of town , the shabby saltbox where the nuns and some other teachers at St. Michael 's lived was positioned like a guardhouse at a corner of the playground  --  in full view of Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statue some small gesture of disrespect , the vigilant nuns would exit their guardhouse on the fly  --  their black habits flapping with the defiant rancorousness of crows . Owen was afraid of nuns . " THEY 'RE UNNATURAL , " he said ; but what , I thought , could be more UNNATURAL than the squeaky falsetto of The Granite Mouse or his commanding presence , which was so out of proportion to his diminutive size ? Every fall , the horse-chestnut trees between Tan Lane and Garfield Street produced many smooth , hard , dark-brown missiles ; it was inevitable that Owen and I should pass by the statue of Mary Magdalene with our pockets full of chestnuts . Despite his fear of nuns , Owen could not resist the target that the holy goalie presented ; I was a better shot , but Owen threw his chestnuts more fervently . We left scarcely any marks on Mary Magdalene 's ground-length robe , on her bland , snowy face , or on her open hands  --  outstretched in apparent supplication . Yet the nuns , in a fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; their pursuit was erratic , their shrieks like the cries of bats surprised by sunlight  --  Owen and I had no trouble outrunning them . " PENGUINS ! " Owen would cry as he ran ; everyone called nuns " penguins . " We 'd run up Cass Street to the railroad tracks and follow the tracks out of town . Before we reached Maiden Hill , or the quarries , we would pass the Fort Rock Farm and throw what remained of our chestnuts at the black angus cattle grazing there ; despite their threatening size and their blue lips and tongues , the black angus would n't chase us as enthusiastically as the penguins , who always gave up their pursuit before Cass Street . And every spring , the swamp between Tan Lane and Garfield Street produced a pondful of tadpoles and toads . Who has n't already told you that boys of a certain age are cruel ? We filled a tennis-ball can with tadpoles and  --  under the cover of darkness  --  poured them over the feet of Mary Magdalene . The tadpoles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry up and die there . We even slaughtered toads and indelicately placed their mutilated bodies in the holy goalie 's upturned palms , staining her with amphibian gore . God forgive us ! We were such delinquents only in these few years of adolescence before Gravesend Academy could save us from ourselves . In the spring of ' 57 , Owen was especially destructive to the helpless swamplife of Gravesend , and to Mary Magdalene ; just before Easter , we 'd been to The Idaho , where we suffered through Cecil B. DeMille 's The Ten Commandments  --  the life of Moses , represented by Charlton Heston undergoing various costume changes and radical hairstyles . " IT 'S ANOTHER MALE-NIPPLE MOVIE , " Owen said ; and , indeed , in addition to Charlton Heston 's nipples , there is evidence of Yul Brynner and John Derek and even Edward G. Robinson having nipples , too . That The Idaho should show The Ten Commandments so close to Easter was another example of what my grandmother called the poor " seasonal " taste of nearly everyone in the entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chosen People on the eve of our Lord 's Passion and Resurrection was outrageous  --  " ALL THAT OLD-TESTAMENT HARSHNESS WHEN WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT JESUS ! " as Owen put it . The parting of the Red Sea especially offended him . " YOU CA N'T TAKE A MIRACLE AND JUST SHOW IT ! " he said indignantly . " YOU CA N'T PROVE A MIRACLE  --  YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE IT ! IF THE RED SEA ACTUALLY PARTED , IT DID N'T LOOK LIKE THAT , " he said . " IT DID N'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING  --  IT 'S NOT A PICTURE ANYONE CAN EVEN IMAGINE ! " But there was n't logic to his anger . If The Ten Commandments made him cross , why take it out on Mary Magdalene and a bunch of toads and tadpoles ' ? In these years before we attended Gravesend Academy , Owen and I were educated  - -  - primarily  --  by what we saw at The Idaho and on my grand/mother 's television . Who has n't been " educated " in this slovenly fashion ? Who can blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reaction would be preferable to believing it ! But if a movie as stupid as The Ten Commandments could make Owen Meany murder toads by throwing them at Mary Magdalene , a performance as compelling as Bette Davis 's in Dark Victory could convince Owen that he , too , had a brain tumor . At first , Bette Davis is dying and does n't know it . Her doctor and her best friend wo n't tell her . " THEY SHOULD TELL HER IMMEDIATELY ! " Owen said anxiously . The doctor was played by George Brent . " He could never do anything right , anyway , " Grandmother observed . Humphrey Bogart is a stableman who speaks with an Irish accent . It was the Christmas of ' 56 and we were watching a movie made in 1939 ; it was the first time Grandmother had permitted us to watch The Late Show  --  at least , I think it was The Late Show . After a certain evening hour  --  or whenever it was that my grandmother began to feel tired  --  she called everything The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastmans were spending another Christmas in the Caribbean ; Sawyer Depot was a pleasure slipping into the past , for me  --  for Owen , it was becoming mere wishful thinking . " You 'd think that Humphrey Bogart could learn a better Irish accent than that , " my grandmother complained . Dan Needham said that he would n't give George Brent a part in a production of The Gravesend Players ; Owen added that Mr. Fish would have been a more convincing doctor to Bette Davis , but Grandmother argued that " Mr. Fish would have his hands full as Bette Davis 's husband "  --  her doctor eventually gets to be her husband , too . " Anyone would have his hands full as Bette Davis 's husband , " Dan observed . Owen thought it was cruel that Bette Davis had to find out she was dying all by herself ; but Dark Victory is one of those movies that presumes to be instructive on the subject of how to die . We see Bette Davis accepting her fate gracefully ; she moves to Vermont with George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that one day , suddenly , darkness will come . " THIS IS VERY SAD ! " Owen cried . " HOW CAN SHE NOT THINK ABOUT IT ? " Ronald Reagan is a vapid young drunk . " She should have married him , " Grandmother said . " She 's dying and he 's already dead . "  |p247Owen  said that the symptoms of Bette Davis 's terminal tumor were familiar to him . " Owen , you do n't have a brain tumor , " Dan Needham told him . " Bette Davis does n't have one , either ! " Grandmother said . " But I think Ronald Reagan has one . " " Maybe George Brent , too , " Dan said . " YOU KNOW THE PART ABOUT THE DIMMING VISION ? " Owen asked . " WELL , SOMETIMES MY VISION DIMS  --  JUST LIKE BETTE DAVIS 'S ! " " You should have your eyes examined , Owen , " Grandmother said . " You do n't have a brain tumor ! " Dan Needham repeated . " I HAVE SOMETHING , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Owen and I spent many nights backstage with The Gravesend Players , but we rarely watched the performances ; we watched the audiences  --  we repopulated those bleacher seats at that Little League game in the summer of ' 53 ; gradually , the stands were filling . We had no doubts about the exact placement of the Kenmores or the Dowlings ; Owen disputed my notion that Maureen Early and Caroline O'Day were in the top row  --  he SAW them nearer the bottom . And we could n't agree about the Brinker-Smiths . " THE BRITISH NEVER WATCH BASEBALL ! " Owen said . But I always had an eye for Ginger Brinker-Smith 's fabled voluptuousness ; I argued that she had been there , that I " saw " her . " YOU WOULD N'T HAVE LOOKED TWICE IF SHE HAD BEEN THERE -- NOT THAT SUMMER , " Owen insisted . " YOU WERE TOO YOUNG , AND BESIDES  --  SHE 'D JUST HAD THE TWINS , SHE WAS A MESS ! " I suggested that Owen was prejudiced against the Brinker-Smiths ever since their strenuous lovemaking had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , we agreed about who had been at the game , and where they had been sitting . Morrison the mailman , we had no doubt , had never watched a game ; and poor Mrs. Merrill  --  despite how fondly the baseball season must have reminded her of the perpetual weather of her native California  --  was never a fan , either . We were not sure about the Rev. Mr. Merrill ; we decided against his being there on the grounds that we had rarely seen him anywhere without his wife . We were sure the Wiggins had not been there ; they were often in attendance , but they displayed such a boorish enthusiasm for every pitch that if they 'd been at that game , we would have noticed them . Since it had been a time when Barb Wiggin still thought of Owen as " cute , " she would have rushed to console him for his unfortunate contact with the fated hall and Rector Wiggin would havep248bungled some rites over my mother 's prostrate form , or pounded my shaking shoulders with manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIGGINS HAD BEEN THERE , THEY WOULD HAVE MADE A SPECTACLE OF THEMSELVES  --  WE WOULD NEVER HAVE FORGOTTEN IT ! " Despite how exciting is any search for a missing parent  --  however mindless the method  --  Owen and I had to admit that , so far , we 'd discovered a rather sparse and uninteresting lot of baseball fans . It never occurred to us to question whether the town 's ardent Little League followers were also steady patrons of The Gravesend Players . " THERE 'S ONE THING YOU MUST NEVER FORGET , " Owen told me . " SHE WAS A GOOD MOTHER . IF SHE THOUGHT THE GUY COULD BE A GOOD FATHER TO YOU , YOU 'D ALREADY KNOW HIM . " " You sound so sure , " I said . " I 'M JUST WARNING YOU , " he said . " IT 'S EXCITING TO LOOK FOR YOUR FATHER , BUT DO N'T EXPECT TO BE THRILLED WHEN YOU FIND HIM . I HOPE YOU KNOW WE 'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DAN ! " I did n't know ; I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my father  --  that much I knew . THE LUST CONNECTION , as Owen called it , also contributed to our ongoing enthusiasm for THE FATHER HUNT  --  as Owen called our overall enterprise . " EVERY TIME YOU GET A BONER , TRY TO THINK IF YOU REMIND YOURSELF OF ANYONE YOU KNOW "  --  that was Owen 's interesting advice on the matter of my lust being my most traceable connection to my missing father . As for lust , I had hoped to see more of Hester  --  now that Noah and Simon were attending Gravesend Academy . But , in fact , I saw her less . Noah 's academic difficulties had caused him to repeat a year ; Simon 's first year had been smoother , probably because it thrilled Simon to have Noah demoted to his grade in school . Both boys , by the Christmas of ' 57 , were juniors at Gravesend  --  and so thoroughly involved in what Owen and I presumed to be the more sophisticated activities of private-school life that I saw only slightly more of them than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon were so bored at the academy that they visited 80 Front Street  --  not even on weekends , which they increasingly spent with their doubtless more exotic classmates . Owen and I assumed that  --  in Noah 's and Simon 's eyes  --  we were too immature for them . Clearly , we were too immature f'or Hester , who  --  in response to Noah being forced to repeat a grade - had managed to have herself ' promoted . Shep249encountered few academic difficulties at Sawyer Depot High School , where  --  Owen and I imagined  --  she was terrorizing faculty and students alike . She had probably gone to some effort to skip a grade , motivated  --  as she always was  --  to get the better of her brothers . Nonetheless , all three of my cousins were scheduled to graduate with the Class of ' 59  --  when Owen and I would be completing our first and lowly ninth-grade year at the academy ; we would graduate with the class of ' 62 . It was humiliating to me ; I 'd hoped that , one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I felt I was less equal to them than I 'd ever been . Hester , in particular , seemed beyond my reach . " WELL , SHE IS YOUR COUSIN  --  SHE SHOULD BE BEYOND YOUR REACH , " Owen said . " ALSO , SHE 'S DANGEROUS  --  YOU 'RE PROBABLY LUCKY SHE 'S BEYOND YOUR REACH . HOWEVER , " Owen added , " IF YOU 'RE REALLY CRAZY ABOUT HER , I THINK IT WILL WORK OUT  --  HESTER WOULD DO ANYTHING TO DRIVE HER PARENTS NUTS , SHE 'D EVEN MARRY YOU ! " " Marry me ! " I cried ; the . thought of marrying Hester gave me the shivers . " WELL , THAT WOULD DRIVE HER PARENTS AROUND THE BEND , " Owen said . " WOULD N'T IT ? " It would have ; and Owen was right : Hester was obsessed with driving her parents  --  and her brothers  --  crazy . To drive them to madness was the penalty she exacted for all of them treating her " like a girl " ; according to Hester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Martha was a " fink of womanhood " ; she bowed to Uncle Alfred 's notion that the boys needed a private-school education , that the boys needed to " expand their horizons . " Hester would expand her own horizons in directions conceived to educate her parents regarding the errors of their ways . As for Owen 's idea that Hester would go to the extreme of marrying her own cousin , if that could provide Aunt Martha and Uncle Alfred with an educational wallop ... it was inconceivable to me ! " I do n't think that Hester even likes me , " I told Owen ; he shrugged . " THE POINT IS , " said Owen Meany , " HESTER WOULD N'T NECESSARILYMARRY YOU BECAUSE SHE LIKED YOU . " Meanwhile , we could n't even manage to get ourselves invited to SawyerDepot for Christmas . After their holidays in the Caribbean , the Eastmans had decided to stay at home for the Yuletide of ' 57 ; Owen and I got our hopes up , hut  --  alas !  --  they were quickly dashed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastmans were n't going to the Caribbean was that Hester had been corresponding with a black boatman who had proposed a rendezvous in the British Virgin Islands ; Hester had involved herself with this particular black boatman the previous Christmas , inp250Tortola  --  when she 'd been only fifteen ! Naturally , how she had " involved herself " was not made explicitly clear to Owen and me ; we had to rely on those parts of the story that my Aunt Martha had reported to Dan  --  substantially more of the story than she had reported to my grandmother , who was of the opinion that a sailor had made a " pass " at poor Hester , an exercise in crudeness that had made Hester want to stay home . In fact , Hester was threatening to escape to Tortola . She was also not speaking to Noah and Simon , who had shown the black boatman 's letters to Uncle Alfred and Aunt Martha , and who had fiercely disappointed Hester by not introducing her to a single one of their Gravesend Academy friends . Dan Needham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " TeenageTraumas Run Wild in Sawyer Depot ! " Dan suggested to Owen and me that we were better off to not involve ourselves with Hester . How true ! But how we wanted to be involved in the thrilling , real-life sleaziness that we suspected Hester was in the thick of . We were in a phase , through television and the movies , of living only vicariously . Even faintly sordid silliness excited us if it put us in contact with love . The closest that Owen Meany and I could get to love was a front-row seat at The Idaho . That Christmas of ' 57 , Owen and I were fifteen ; we told each other that we had fallen in love with Audrey Hepburn , the shy bookstore clerk in Funny Face ; but we wanted Hester . What we were left with was a sense of how little , in the area of love , we must be worth ; we felt more foolish than Fred Astaire , dancing with his own raincoat . And how worried we were that the sophisticated world of Gravesend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toronto : April 12 , 1987  --  a rainy Palm Sunday . It is not a warm spring rain  --  not a " seasonal " rain , as my grandmother liked to say . It is a raw cold rain , a suitable day for the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ . At Grace Church on-the-Hill , the children and the acolytes stood huddled in the narthex ; holding their palm fronds , they resembled tourists who 'd landed in the tropics on an unseasonably cold day . The organist chose Brahms for the processional  --  " O Welt ich muss dich Lassen " ; " 0 world I must leave you . Owen hated Palm Sunday : the treachery of Judas , the cowardice of Peter , the weakness of Pilate . " IT 'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY CRUCIFIED HIM , " Owen said , " BUT THEY MADE FUN OF HIM , TOO ! " Canon Mackie read heavily from Matthew : how they mocked Jesus , how they spit on him , how he cried , " My God , my God , why hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is draining ; no matter how many times I have livedp251through his crucifixion , my anxiety about his resurrection is undiminished  --  Iam terrified that , this year , it wo n't happen ; that , that year , it did n't . Anyone can be sentimental about the Nativity ; any fool can feel like a Christian at Christmas . But Easter is the main event ; if you do n't believe in the resurrection , you 're not a believer . " IF YOU DO N'T BELIEVE IN EASTER , " Owen Meany said , " DO N'T KID YOURSELF  --  DO N'T CALL YOURSELF A CHRIS-TIAN . " For the Palm Sunday recessional , the organist chose the usual " Alleluias . " In a chilling drizzle , I crossed Russell Hill Road and went in the service entrance of The Bishop Strachan School ; I passed through the kitchen , where the working women and the boarders whose turn it was to help with the Sunday meal all spoke to me . The headmistress , the Rev. Mrs. Katherine Keeling , sat in her usual head-of-table position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who had no local friends to ask them home for the weekend , and the girls who were happy to stay at school  --  sat around the other tables . It is always a surprise to see the girls not in their uniforms ; I know it 's a great relief to them to wear their uniforms day in , day out  --  because they do n't have to worry about what to wear . But they are so lazy about how they wear their uniforms  --  they do n't have much experience in dressing themselves  --  that when they have a choice , when they 're allowed to wear their own clothes , they appear wholly less sophisticated , less worldly , than they appear in their uniforms . In the twenty years that I have been a teacher at The Bishop Strachan School , the girls ' uniforms have n't changed very significantly ; I 've grown rather fond of them . If I were a girl , of any age , I would wear a middie , a loosely tied necktie , a blazer ( with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call " knee highs "  --  and a pleated skirt ; when they kneel , it used to be the rule that the skirt should just touch the floor . But for Sunday boarders ' lunch , the girls wear their own clothes ; some of them are so badly dressed , I fail to recognize them  --  they make fun of me for that , naturally . Some of them dress like boys  --  others , like their mothers or like the floozies they see in movies or on TV . As I am , routinely , the only man in the dining room for Sunday boarders ' lunch , perhaps they dress fur me . I 've not seen my friend  --  and , technically , my boss  --  Katherine Keeling since she delivered her last baby . She has a large family  --  she 's had so many children , I 've lost count  --  but she makes an effort to sit at the housemothers ' table on Sundays ; and she chatters amiably to the weekend girls . I think Katherine is terrific ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I catch her not eating , although she should get over the surmise , I 'm a more consistent fixture at the housemothers ' table forp252Sunday boarders ' lunch than she is  --  I do n't take time off to have babies ! But there she was on Palm Sunday , with mashed potatoes and stuffing and turkey heaped upon her plate . " Turkey rather dry , is it ? " I asked ; the ladies , routinely , laughed  --  Katherine , typically , blushed . When she 's wearing her clerical collar , she looks slightly more underweight than she actually is . She 's my closest friend in Toronto , now that Canon Campbell is gone ; and even though she 's my boss , I 've been at Bishop Strachan longer than she has . Old Teddybear Kilgour , as we called him , was principal when I was hired . Canon Campbell introduced us . Canon Campbell had been the chaplain at Bishop Strachan before they made him rector of Grace Church on-the-Hill ; I could n't have had anyone recommend me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the school than Canon Campbell  --  not even old Teddybear Kilgour himself . I still tease Katherine about those days . What if she 'd been headmistress when I applied for a job ? Would she have hired me ? A young man from the States in those Vietnam years , a not unattractive young man , and without a wife ; Bishop Strachan has never had many male teachers , and in my twenty years of teaching these young girls , I have occasionally been the only male teacher at the school . Canon Campbell and old Teddybear Kilgour do n't count ; they were not male in the threatening sense  --  they were not potentially dangerous to young girls . Although the canon taught Scripture and History , in addition to his duties as chaplain , he was an elderly man ; and he and old Teddybear Kilgour were " married up to their ears , " as Katherine Keeling likes to say . Old Teddybear did ask me if I was " attracted to young girls " ; but I must have impressed him that I would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself with those young girls ' minds and not their bodies . " And have you ? " Katherine Keeling likes to ask me . How the housemotherstitter at the question  --  like Liberace 's live audiences of long ago ! Katherine is a much more jubilant soul than my grandmother , but she has a certain twinkling sarcasm  --  and the proper elocution , the good diction  --  that reminds me of Grandmother . They would have liked each other ; Owen would have liked the Rev. Mrs. Keeling , too . I 've misled you if I 've conveyed an atmosphere of loneliness at Sunday boarders ' lunch . Perhaps the boarders feel acutely lonely then , but I feel fine . Rituals are comforting ; rituals combat loneliness . On Palm Sunday , there was much talk about the weather . The week before , it had been so cold that everyone commented on the annual error of the birds . Every spring  --  at least , in Canada  --  some birds fly north too soon . Thousands are caught in the cold ; they return south in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robins and starlings . Katherine had seen some killdeer flying south  --  I had a common-snipe story that impressed them all . We 'd all read The Globe and Mail that week : we 'd loved the story about the turkey vultures who " iced up " and could n't fly ; they were mistaken for hawks and taken to a humane society for thawing-out  --  there were nine of them and they threw up all over their handlers . The humane society could not have been expected to know that turkey vultures vomit when attacked . Who would guess that turkey vultures are so smart ? I 've also misled you if I 've conveyed an atmosphere of trivia at Sunday boarders ' lunch ; these lunches are important to me . After the Palm Sunday lunch , Katherine and I walked over to Grace Church and signed up for the All Night Vigil on the notice board in the narthex . Every Maundy Thursday , the Vigil of Prayer and Quiet is kept from nine o'clock that evening until nine o'clock in the morning of Good Friday . Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we take the Vigil from three to five o'clock in the morning , when Katherine 's husband and children are asleep and do n't need her . This year she cautioned me : " I may be a little late  --  if the two-o'clock feeding is much later than two o'clock ! " She laughs , and her endearingly stick-thin neck looks especially vulnerable in her clerical collar . I see many parents of the Bishop Strachan girls  --  they are so smartly dressed , they drive Jaguars , they never have time to talk . I know that they dismiss the Rev. Mrs. Katherine Keeling as a typical headmistress type  --  Katherine is not the sort of woman they would look at twice . But she is wise and kind and witty and articulate ; and she does not bullshit herself about what Easter means . " EASTER MEANS WHAT IT SAYS , " said Owen Meany . At Christ Church on Easter Sunday , Rector Wiggin always said : " Alleluia . Christ is risen . " And we , the People  --  we said : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 19 , 1987  --  a humid , summery Easter Sunday . It does not matter what prelude begins the service ; I will always hear Handel 's Messiah  --  and my mother 's not-quite-trained soprano singing , " I know that my Redeemer liveth . " This morning , in Grace Church on-the-Hill , I sat very still , waiting for that passage in John ; I knew what was coming . In the old King James version , it was called a " sepulchre " ; in the Revised Standard version , it is just a " tomb . " Either way , I know the story by heart . Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early , while it was still dark , and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb . So she ran , and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple ,  |p254the  one whom Jesus loved , and said to them , They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about that passage ; every Easter , he would lean against me in the pew and whisper into my ear . " THIS IS THE PART THAT ALWAYS GIVES ME THE SHIVERS . " After the service today , my fellow Torontonians and I stood in the sun on the church steps  --  and we lingered on the sidewalk along Lonsdale Road ; the sun was so welcome , and so hot . We were childishly delighted by the heat , as if we 'd spent years in an atmosphere as cold as the tomb where Mary Magdalene found Jesus missing . Leaning against me , and whispering into my ear  --  in a manner remindful of Owen Meany  --  Katherine Keeling said : " Those birds that flew north , and then south  --  today they 're flying north again . " " Alleluia , " I said . I was thinking of Owen when I added , " He is risen . " " Alleluia , " said the Rev. Mrs. Keeling . That the television was always " on " at 80 Front Street ceased to tempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to herself or to Ethel  --  or directly commenting to the TV  --  and we heard the rise and fall of the studio-made laughter . It was a big house ; for four years , Owen and I had the impression that there was always a forbidding gathering of grown-ups , chattering away in a distant room . My grandmother sounded as if she were the haranguing leader of a compliant mob , as if it were her special responsibility to berate her audience and to amuse them , almost simultaneously  --  for they rewarded her humor with their punctual laughter , as if they were highly entertained that the tone of voice she used on them was uniformly abusive . Thus Owen Meany and I learned what crap television was , without ever thinking that we had n't come to this opinion by ourselves ; had my grandmother allowed us only two hours of TV a day , or not permitted us more than one hour on a " school night , " we probably would have become as slavishly devoted to television as the rest of our generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw on television , but he saw everything  --  as much of everything as he could stand . After four years of television , though , he watched nothing but Liberace and the old movies . I did , or tried to do , everything Owen did . For example : in the summer of ' 58 when we were both sixteen , Owen got his driver 's license before I got mine  --  not only because he was a month older , but because he already knew how to drive . He 'd taught himself with his father 's various trucks  --  he 'd been driving on those steep , loopy roads that ran around the quarries that pockmarked most of Maiden Hill . He took his driver 's test on the day of ' his sixteenth birthday , using hisp255father 's tomato-red pickup truck ; in those days , there was no driver education course in New Hampshire , and you took your test with a local policeman in the passenger seat  --  the policeman told you where to turn , when to stop or back up or park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Ben Pike himself ; Chief Pike expressed concern regarding whether or not Owen could reach the pedals  --  or see over the steering wheel . But Owen had anticipated this : he was mechanically inclined , and he 'd raised the seat of the pickup so high that Chief Pike hit his head on the roof ; Owen had slid the seat so far forward that Chief Pike had considerable difficulty cramming his knees under the dashboard  --  in fact , Chief Pike was so physically uncomfortable in the cab of the pickup that he cut Owen 's test fairly short . " HE DID N'T EVEN MAKE ME PARALLEL-PARK ! " Owen said ; he was disappointed that he was denied the opportunity to show off his parallel-parking abilities -- Owen Meany could slip that tomato-red pickup into a parking space that would have been challenging for a Volkswagen Beetle . In retrospect , I 'm surprised that Chief Pike did n't search the interior of the pickup for that " instrument of death " he was always looking for . Dan Needham taught me to drive ; it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and he would take me for lessons every morning before rehearsals . Dan would drive me out the Swasey Parkway and up Maiden Hill . I practiced on the back roads around the quarries  --  the roads on which Owen Meany learned to drive were good enough for me ; and Dan judged it safer for me off the public highways , although the Meany Granite Company vehicles flew around those roads with reckless abandon . The quarrymen were fearless drivers and they trucked the granite and their machinery at full throttle ; but , in the summer , the trucks raised so much dust that Dan and I had warning when one was coming  --  I always had time to pull over , while Dan recited his favorite Shakespeare from Julius Caesar . Cowards die many times before their deaths ; The valiant never taste of death but once . Whereupon , Dan would grip the dashboard and tremble while a dynamite truck hurtled past us . Of all the wonders that I yet have heard , It seems to me the most strange that men should fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come when it will come . Owen , too , was fond of that passage . When we saw Dan 's production of Julius Caesar , later that summer , I had passed my driver 's test ; yet , in thep256evenings , when Owen and I would drive down to the boardwalk and the casino at Hampton Beach together , we took the tomato-red pickup and Owen always drove . I paid for the gas . Those summer nights of 1958 were the first nights I remember feeling " grown up " ; we 'd drive half an hour from Gravesend for the fleeting privilege of inching along a crowded , gaudy strip of beachfront , looking at girls who rarely looked at us . Sometimes , they looked at the truck . We could drive along this strip only two or three times before a cop would motion us over to the side of the street , examine Owen 's driver 's license  --  in disbelief  --  and then suggest that we find a place to park the truck and resume our looking at girls on foot , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcades . Walking with Owen Meany at Hampton Beach was ill-advised ; he was so strikingly small , he was teased and roughed up by the delinquent young men who tilted the pinball machines and swaggered in the heated vicinity of the girls in their cotton-candy-colored clothes . And the girls , who rarely returned our glances when we were secure in the Meany Granite Company pickup , took very long ( and giggling ) looks at Owen when we were on foot . When he was walking , Owen did n't dare look at the girls . Therefore , when a cop would , inevitably , advise us to park the truck and pursue our interests " on foot , " Owen and I would drive back to Gravesend . Or we would drive to a popular daytime beach  --  Little Boar 's Head , which was beautifully empty at night . We 'd sit on the sea wall , and feel the cool air off the ocean , and watch the phosphorescence sparkle in the surf . Or we would drive to Rye Harbor and sit on the breakwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pondlike surface ; the breakwater itself had been built with the slag  --  the broken slabs  --  from the Meany Granite Quarry . " THEREFORE , I HAVE A RIGHT TO SIT HERE , " Owen always said ; no one , of course , ever challenged our being there . Even though the girls ignored us that summer , that was when I noticed that Owen was attractive to women  --  not only to my mother . It is difficult to say how he was attractive , or why ; but even when he was sixteen , even when he was especially shy or awkward , he looked like someone who had earned what grasp of the world he had . I might have been particularly conscious of this aspect of him because he had truly earned so much more than I had . It was not just that he was a better student , or a better driver , or so philosophically sure of himself ; here was someone I had grown up with , and had grown used to teasing  --  I had picked him up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had derided his smallness as surely as the other children had  --  and yet , suddenly , by the time he was sixteen , he appeared in command . He was more in command of himself than the rest of us , he was more in command of us than the rest of us  - -  and with women ,  |p257even  with those girls who giggled when they looked at him , you sensed how compelled they were to touch him . And by the end of the summer of ' 58 , he had something astonishing for a sixteen-year-old  --  in those days before all this ardent and cosmetic weightlifting , he had muscles ! To be sure , he was tiny , but he was fiercely strong , and his sinewy strength was as visible as the strength of a whippet ; although he was frighteningly lean , there was already something very adult about his muscular development  --  and why not ? After all , he 'd spent the summer working with granite . I had n't even been working . In June , he 'd started as a stonecutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monument shop , cutting with the grain , WITH THE RIFT , as he called it  --  using the wedge and feathers . By the middle of the month , his father had taught him how to saw against the grain ; the sawyers cut up the bigger slabs , and they finished the gravestones with what was called a diamond wheel  --  a circular blade , impregnated with diamonds . By July , he was working in the quarries  --  he was often the signalman , but his father apprenticed him to the other quarrymen : the channel bar drillers , the derrickman , the dynamiters . It seemed to me that he spent most of the month of August in a single , remote pit  --  one hundred and seventy-five feet deep , a football field in diameter . He and the other men were lowered to work in a grout bucket  --  " grout " is waste , the rubble of broken rock that is raised from the pit all day long . At the end of the day , they bring up the men in the bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs close to two hundred pounds per cubic foot . Ironically  --  even though they worked with the diamond wheel  --  most of the sawyers had all their fingers ; but none of the quarrymen had all their fingers ; only Mr. Meany had all his . " I 'LL KEEP ALL MINE , TOO , " Owen said . " YOU 'VE GOT TO BE MORE THAN QUICK , YOU 'VE GOT TO FEEL WHEN THE ROCK 'S GOING TO MOVE BEFORE IT MOVES  --  YOU 'VE GOT TO MOVE BEFORE THE ROCK MOVES . " Just the slightest fuzz grew on his upper lip ; nowhere else did his face show traces of a beard , and the faint moustache was so downy and such a pale-gray color that I first mistook it for pulverized granite , the familiar rock dust that clung to him . Yet his face  --  his nose , the sockets for his eyes , his cheekbones , and the contours of his jaw  --  had the gaunt definition that one sees in the faces of sixteen-year-olds only when they are starving . By September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the yellow glow of the dashboard lights , when we went out driving in the pickup at night , I would catch a glimpse of his profile with the cigarette dangling from his lips ; his face had a permanent adult quality . Those mothers ' breasts he 'd once unfavorably compared to my mother'sp258breasts were beneath his interest now , although Barb Wiggin 's were still TOO BIG , Mrs. Webster 's were still TOO LOW , and Mrs. Merrill 's only VERY FUNNY . While Ginger Brinker-Smith , as a younger mother , had claimed our attention , we now ( for the most part ) coolly assessed our peers . THE TWO CAROLINES  --  Caroline Perkins and Caroline O'Day  --  appealed to us , although the breasts of Caroline O'Day were devalued , in Owen 's view , by her Catholicism . Maureen Early 's bosom was judged to be PERKY ; Hannah Abbot 's breasts were SMALL BUT SHAPELY ; Irene Babson , who had given Owen the shivers as long ago as when my mother 's bosom was under review , was now so out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy Dearborn , Betsy Bickford , Sarah Tilton , Polly Farnum  --  to their names , and to the contours of their young breasts , Owen Meany would inhale a Camel deeply . The summer wind rushed through the rolled-down window of the pickup ; when he exhaled , slowly , through his nostrils , the cigarette smoke was swept away from his face  --  dramatically exposing him as if he were a man miraculously emerging from a fire . " IT 'S TOO SOON TO TELL  --  WITH MOST SIXTEEN-YEAROLDS , " Owen said , sounding already worldly enough for any conversation he might encounter at Gravesend Academy  --  although we both knew that the problem with the sixteen-year-old girls who interested us was that they dated eighteen-year-olds . " BY THE TIME WE 'RE EIGHTEEN , WE 'LL GET THEM BACK , " Owen said . " AND WE 'LL GET ALL THE SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS , TOO  --  THE ONES WE WANT , " he added , inhaling again and squinting into the oncoming headlights . By the fall of ' 58 , when we entered Gravesend Academy , Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acquired for him was more stylish than anything you could buy in New Hampshire . My clothes all came from Gravesend , but Grandmother took Owen shopping in Boston ; it was his first time on a train , and  --  since they were both smokers  --  they rode in the smoking coach together and shared their nearly constant ( and critical ) comments on the attire of their fellow passengers on the Boston &; Maine , and on the comparative courtesy ( or lack thereof ) of the conductors . Grandmother outfitted Owen almost entirely at Filene 's and Jordan Marsh , one of which had a Small Gentlemen 's Department , which the other called A Small Man 's Special Needs . Jordan Marsh and Filene 's were pretty flashy labels by New Hampshire standards  --  " THIS IS NOT BARGAIN-BASEMENT STUFF ! " Owen said proudly . For our first day of classes , Owen showed up looking like a small Harvard lawyer . He was not intimidated by the bigger boys because he had always been smaller ; and he was not intimidated by the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial difference between Gravesend , thep259town , and Gravesend , the academy : the town paper , The Gravesend News-Letter , reported all the news that was decent and believed that all things decent were important ; the school newspaper , which was called The Grave , reported every indecency that could escape the censorship of the paper 's faculty adviser and believed that all things decent were boring . Gravesend Academy embraced a cynical tone of voice , savored a criticism of everything that anyone took seriously ; the students hallowed , above everyone else , that boy who saw himself as born to break the rules , as destined to change the laws . And to the students of Gravesend who thus chafed against their bonds , the only accepted tone was caustic  --  was biting , mordant , bitter , scathing sarcasm , the juicy vocabulary of which Owen Meany had already learned from my grandmother . He had mastered sarcasm in much the same way he had become a smoker ; he was a pack-a-day man in a month . In his first fall term at Gravesend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the lingo of those times , everyone was a something " master " ; Dan Needham tells me that this is one of those examples of student language that endures  --  at Gravesend Academy , the term is still in use . I have never heard it at Bishop Strachan . But Owen Meany was Sarcasm Master in the way that big Buster York was Barf Master , that Skipper Hilton was Zit Master , that Morris West was Nose Master , that Duffy Swain ( who was prematurely bald ) was Hair Master , that George Fogg ( the hockey player ) was Ice Master , that Horace Brigham ( a lady 's man ) was Snatch Master . No one found a name for me . Among the editors of The Grave , in which Owen published the first essay he was assigned in English class , Owen was known as " The Voice . " His essay was a satire on the source of food in the school dining hall  --  " MYSTERY MEAT , " Owen titled the essay and the unrecognizable , gray steaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published as an editorial , described the slaughter and refrigeration of an unidentified , possibly prehistoric beast that was dragged to the underground kitchen of the school in chains , " IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT . " The editorial and the subsequent weekly essays that Owen published in The Grave were ascribed not to Owen Meany by name , but to " The Voice " ; and the text was printed in uniform upper-case letters . " I 'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE PUBLISHED IN CAPITALS , " Owen explained to Dan and me , " BECAUSE IT WILL INSTANTLY GRAB THE READER 'S ATTENTION , ESPECIALLY AFTER THE VOICE ' GETS TO BE A KIND OF INSTITUTION . " By the Christmas of 1958 , in our first year at the academy , that is what Owen Meany had become : The Voice  --  A KIND OF INSTITUTION . Even the Search Committee  --  appointed to find a new headmaster  --  was interested in what The Voice had to say . Applicants for the position werep260given a subscription to The Grave ; the snide , sneering precocity of the student body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the capitals that commanded one 's gaze to Owen Meany . There were some old curmudgeons on the faculty  --  and some young fuddy-duddies , too  --  who objected to Owen 's style ; and I do n't mean that they objected only to his outrageous capitalization . Dan Needham told me that there 'd been more than one heated debate in faculty meeting concerning the " marginal taste " of Owen 's blanket criticism of the school ; granted , it was well within a long-established tradition for Gravesend students to complain about the academy , but Owen 's sarcasm suggested , to some , a total and threatening irreverence . Dan defended Owen ; but The Voice was a proven irritant to many of the more insecure members of the Gravesend community  --  including those faraway but important subscribers to The Grave : " concerned " parents and alumni . The subject of " concerned " parents and alumni yielded an especially lively and controversial column for The Voice . " WHAT ARE THEY CONCERNED ' ABOUT ? " Owen pondered . " ARE THEY CONCERNED ' WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMELY '  --  OR ARE THEY ' CONCERNED ' THAT WE MIGHT POSSIBLY LEARN MORE THAN THEY HAVE LEARNED ; THAT WE MIGHT INFORM OURSELVES SUFFICIENTLYTO CHALLENGE A FEW OF THEIR MORE HARDENED AND IDIOTIC OPINIONS ? ARE THEY CONCERNED ' ABOUT THE QUALITY AND VIGOROUSNESS OF OUR EDUCATION ; OR ARE THEY MORE SUPERFICIALLY CONCERNED ' THAT WE MIGHT FAIL TO GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE OF THEIR CHOICE ? " Then there was the column that challenged the coat-and-tie dress code , arguing that it was " INCONSISTENT TO DRESS US LIKE GROWNUPSAND TREAT US LIKE CHILDREN . " And there was the column about required church-attendance , arguing that " IT RUINS THE PROPER ATMOSPHERE FOR PRAYER AND WORSHIP TO HAVE THE CHURCH ANY CHURCH  --  FULL OF RESTLESS ADOLESCENTS WHO WOULD RATHER BE SLEEPING LATE OR INDULGING IN SEXUAL FANTASIES OR PLAYING SQUASH . FURTHERMORE , REQUIRING ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH  --  FORCING YOUNG PEOPLETO PARTICIPATE IN THE RITUALS OF A BELIEF THEY DO N'T SHARE  --  SERVES MERELY TO PREJUDICE THOSE SAME YOUNG PEOPLE AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS , AND AGAINST SINCERELY RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS . I BELIEVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROADEN AND EXPAND OUR PREJUDICES . "  |p261And  on and on . You should have heard him on the subject of required athletics : " BORN OF A BROWN-SHIRT MENTALITY , A CONCEPT EMBRACED BY THE HITLER YOUTH ! " And on the regulation that boarders were not allowed to enjoy more than three weekends off-campus in a single term : " ARE WE SO SIMPLE , IN THE ADMINISTRATION 'S VIEW , THAT WE ARE CHARACTERIZED AS CONTENT TO SPEND OUR WEEKENDS AS ATHLETIC HEROES OR FANS OF SPECTATOR SPORTS ; IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF US MIGHT FIND MORE STIMULATION AT HOME , OR AT THE HOME OF A FRIEND  --  OR ( EVEN ) AT A GIRLS ' SCHOOL ? AND I DO N'T MEAN AT ONE OF THOSE OVERORGANIZED AND CHARMLESSLY CHAPERONED DANCES ! " The Voice was our voice ; he championed our causes ; he made us proud of ourselves in an atmosphere that belittled and intimidated us . But his was also a voice that could criticize us . When a boy was thrown out of school for killing cats  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we were quick to say how " sick " he was ; it was Owen who reminded us that all boys ( himself included ) were touched by that same sickness . " WHO ARE WE TO BE RIGHTEOUS ? " he asked us . " I HAVE MURDERED TADPOLES AND TOADS  --  I 'VE BEEN A MASSMURDEREROF INNOCENT WILDLIFE ! " He described his mutilations in a self-condemnatory , regretful tone ; although he also confessed his slight vandalism of the sainted Mary Magdalene , I was amused to see that he offered no apologies to the nuns of St. Michael 's  --  it was the tadpoles and toads he was sorry about . " WHAT BOY HAS N'T KILLED LIVE THINGS ? OF COURSE , IT 'S SICK ' TO BE A HANGMAN OF POOR CATS  --  BUT HOW IS IT WORSE THAN WHAT MOST OF US HAVE DONE ? I HOPE WE 'VE OUTGROWN IT , BUT DOES THAT MEAN WE FORGET THAT WE WERE LIKE THAT ? DO THE FACULTY REMEMBER BEING BOYS ? HOW CAN THEY PRESUME TO TEACH US ABOUT OURSELVES IF THEY DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLACE WHERE WE THINK THE TEACHING IS SO GREAT , WHY NOT TEACH THE KID THAT KILLING CATS IS ' SICK '  --  WHY THROW HIM OUT ? " It would grow to be a theme of Owen 's : " WHY THROW HIM OUT ? " he would ask , repeatedly . When he agreed that someone should have been thrown out , he said so . Drinking was punishable by dismissal , but Owen argued that getting other students drunk should be a more punishable offense than solitary drinking ; also , that most forms of drinking were " NOT AS DESTRUCTIVE AS THE ALMOST-ROUTINE HARASSMENTOE S't'l1DEN'I 'S WHO ARE NOT ' COOL ' BY STUDENTS WHO THINK F1 ' IS ' ( ' OOl . ' ' FO BE HARSHLY ABUSIVE - BOTH VLR/BALLY ABUSIVE AND PHYSICALLY INTIMIDATING . CRUEL AND DELIBERATE MOCKERY IS WORSE THAN DRINKING ; STUDENTS WHO BAIT AND MERCILESSLY TEASE THEIR FELLOW STUDENTSARE GUILTY OF WHAT SHOULD BE A MORE ' PUNISHABLEOFFENSE ' THAN GETTING DRUNK  --  ESPECIALLY IN THOSE INSTANCES WHEN YOUR DRUNKENNESS HURTS NO ONE BUT YOURSELF . " It was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " black-coffee Meany , " and " pack-a-day Meany " ; he believed in his own alertness  --  he was sharp , he wanted to stay sharp . His column on " THE PERILS OF DRINK AND DRUGS " must have appealed even to his critics ; if he was not afraid of the faculty , he was also not afraid of his peers . It was still only our first , our ninth-grade year , when Owen invited Hester to the Senior Dance  --  in Noah and Simon 's graduating year , Owen Meany dared to invite their dreaded sister to their senior-class dance ! " She 'll just use you to meet other guys , " Noah warned him . " She 'll fuck our whole class and leave you looking at the chandelier , " Simon told Owen . I was furious with him . I wished I 'd had the nerve to ask Hester to be my date ; but how do you " date " your first cousin ? Noah and Simon and I commiserated ; as much as Owen had captured our admiration , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being the instrument of Hester 's debut at Gravesend Academy . " Hester the Molester , " Simon repeated and repeated . " She 's just a Sawyer Depot kind of girl , " Noah said condescendingly . But Hester knew much more about Gravesend Academy than any of us knew she knew ; on that balmy , spring weekend in 1959 , Hester arrived prepared . After all , Owen had sent her every issue of The Grave ; if she had once regarded Owen with distaste  --  she had called him queer and crazy , and a creep  --  Hester was no fool . She could tell when a star had risen . And Hester was committed to irreverence ; it should have been no surprise to Noah and Simon and me that The Voice had won her heart . Whatever had been her actual experience with the black boatman from Tortola , the encounter had lent to Hester 's recklessly blooming young womanhood a measure of restraint that women gain from only the most tragic entanglements with love ; in addition to her dark and primitive beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention to her full , imposing bosom and to the hardness of the bones in her somber face , Hester now held herself back just enough to make her dangerousness both more subtle and more absolute . Her wariness matured her ; she had always known how to dress  --  I think it ran in the family . In Hester 's case , she wore simple , expensive clothes -- hut more casually than the designer hadp263intended , and the fit was never quite right ; her body belonged in the jungle , covered only essentially , possibly with fur or grass . For the Senior Dance , she wore a short black dress with spaghetti straps as thin as string ; the dress had a full skirt , a fitted waist , and a deeply plunging neckline that exposed a broad expanse of Hester 's throat and chest  --  a fetching background for the necklace of rose-gray pearls my Aunt Martha had given her for her seventeenth birthday . She wore no stockings and danced barefoot ; around one ankle was a black rawhide thong , from which a turquoise bauble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value could have been only sentimental ; Noah implied that the Tortola boatman had given it to her . At the Senior Dance , the faculty chaperones  --  and their wives  --  never took their eyes off her . We were all enthralled . When Owen Meany danced with Hester , the sharp bridge of his nose fit perfectly in her cleavage ; no one even " cut in . " There we were , in our rented tuxedos , boys more afraid of pimples than of war ; but Owen 's tux was not rented  --  my grandmother had bought it for him  --  and in its tailoring , in its lack of shine , in its touch of satin on its slim lapels , it eloquently spoke to the matter that was so obvious to us all : how The Voice expressed what we were unable to say . Like all dances at the academy , this one ended under extreme supervision ; no one could leave the dance early ; and when one left , and had escorted one 's date to the visitor 's dorm , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " precisely fifteen minutes after having " checked out " of the dance . But Hester was staying at 80 Front Street . I was too mortified to spend that weekend at my grandmother 's  --  with Hester as Owen 's date  --  and so I returned to Dan 's dorm with the other boys who marched to the school 's rules . Owen , who had the day boy 's standing permission to drive himself to and from the academy , drove Hester back to 80 Front Street . Once in the cab of the tomato-red pickup , Hester and Owen were freed from the regulations of the Dance Committee ; they lit up , the smoke from their cigarettes concealed the assumed complacency of their expressions , and each of them lolled an arm out a rolled-down window as Owen turned up the volume of the radio and drove artfully away . With his cigarette , with Hester beside him  --  in his tux , in the high cab of that tomato-red pickup  --  Owen Meany looked almost tall . Other boys claimed that they " did it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their dorms . Other boys displayed kissing techniques in lobbies , risked " copping a feel " in coat rooms , defied the chaperones ' quick censure of anything as vulgar as sticking a tongue in a girl 's ear . But beyond the indisputable fact of his nose embedded in Iester 's cleavage , Owen and Hester did not resort to either common or gloss forms of public affection . And how he later rebuked our childishnessp264by refusing to talk about her ; if he " did it " with her , The Voice was not bragging about it . He took Hester back to 80 Front Street and they watched The Late Show together ; he drove himself back to the quarry  --  " IT WAS RATHER LATE , " he admitted . " What was the movie ? " I asked . " WHAT MOVIE ? " " On The Late Show ! " " OH , I FORGET ... " " Hester must have fucked his brains out , " Simon said morosely ; Noah hit him . " Since when does Owen forget ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Owen even remembers The Robe ! " Simon said ; Noah hit him in the mouth , and Simon started swinging . " It does n't matter ! " Simon yelled . " Hester fucks everybody ! " Noah had his brother by the throat . " We do n't know that , " he said to Simon . " We think it ! " Simon cried . " It 's okay to think it , " Noah told his brother ; he rubbed his forearm back and forth across Simon 's nose , which began to bleed . " But if we do n't know it , we do n't say it . " " Hester fucked Owen 's brains out ! " Simon screamed ; Noah drove the point of his elbow into the hollow between Simon 's eyes . " We do n't know that , " he repeated ; but I had grown accustomed to their savage fights  --  they no longer frightened me . Their brutality seemed plain and safe alongside my conflicted feelings for Hester , my crushing envy of Owen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " IT IS HARD TO KNOW , IN THE WAKE OF THE DISTURBING DANCE-WEEKEND , WHETHER OUR ESTEEMED PEERS OR OUR ESTEEMED FACULTY CHAPERONESSHOULD BE MORE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES . IT IS PUERILE FOR YOUNG MEN TO DISCUSS WHAT DEGREE OF ADVANTAGE THEY TOOK OF THEIR DATES ; IT IS DISRESPECTFULOF WOMEN  --  ALL THIS CHEAP BRAGGING  --  AND IT GIVES MEN A BAD REPUTATION . WHY SHOULD WOMEN TRUST US ? BUT IT IS HARD TO SAY WHETHER THIS BOORISH BEHAVIOR IS WORSE OR BETTER THAN THE GESTAPO TACTICS OF OUR PURITAN CHAPERONES . THE DEAN 'S OFFICE TELLS ME THAT TWO SENIORS HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY PROBATION  --  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM !  --  FOR THEIR ALLEGED OVERT INDISCRETIONS ' ; I BELIEVE THE TWO INCIDENTSFALL UNDER THE PUNISHABLE OFFENSE OF ' MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT WITH GIRLS .

TWO ! A BOY WAS SEEN LEAVING THE BUTT ROOM IN BANCROFT HALL WITH HIS TONGUE IN HIS DATE 'S EAR  --  AN ODD AND OSTENTATIOUS MANNER IN WHICH TO EXIT A SMOKING LOUNGE , I WILL AGREE , BUT THIS DEGREE OF PHYSICAL CONTACT IS ALSO NOT KNOWN TO RESULT IN A PREGNANCY . TO MY KNOWLEDGE , IT IS EVEN DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE THE COMMON COLD BY THIS METHOD . " After that one , it became customary for the applicants  --  for the position of headmaster  --  to request to meet him when they were interviewed . The Search Committee had a student subcommittee available to interview each candidate ; but when the candidates asked to meet The Voice , Owen insisted that he be given A PRIVATE AUDIENCE . The issue of Owen being granted this privilege was the subject of a special faculty meeting where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the faculty adviser to The Grave  --  there were those who said that the " pregnancy humor " in Owen 's column about the Senior Dance should not have escaped the adviser 's censorship . But the faculty adviser to The Grave was an Owen Meany supporter ; Mr. Early  --  that deeply flawed thespian who brought to every role he was given in The Gravesend Players an overblown and befuddled sense of Learlike doom  --  cried that he would defend the " unsullied genius " of The Voice , if necessary , " to the death . " That would not be necessary , Dan Needham was sure ; but that Owen was supported by such a boob as Mr. Early was conceivably worse than no defense at all . Several applicants for the headmaster position admitted that their interviews with The Voice had been " daunting " ; I 'm sure that they were unprepared for his size , and when they heard him speak , I 'm sure they got the shivers and were troubled by the absurdity of that voice communicating strictly in upper-case letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no direct evidence that Owen had contributed to the candidate 's retreat , the man admitted there was a certain quality of " accepted cynicism " among the students that had " depressed " him . The man added that these students demonstrated an " attitude of superiority "  --  and " such a degree of freedom of speech as to make their liberal education too liberal . "  | " Nonsense ! " Dan Needham had cried in the faculty meeting . " Owen Meany is n't cynical ! If this guy was referring to Owen , he was referring to him incorrectly . Good riddance ! " But not all the faculty felt that way . The Search Committee would need another year to satisfy their search ; the present headmaster cheerfully agreed  --  for the good of the school  --  to stall his retirement . He was all " for the good of the school , " the old headmaster ; and it was his support of Owen Meany that  --  for a while  --  kept Owen 's enemies from his throat . " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't miss reading The Voice  --  not for all the world ! " His name was Archibald Thorndike , and he 'd been headmaster forever ; he 'd married the daughter of the headmaster before him , and he was about as " old school " as a headmaster could get . Although the newer , more progressive-minded faculty complained about Archie Thorndike 's reluctance to change a single course requirement  --  not to mention his views of " the whole boy "  --  the headmaster had no enemies . Old " Thorny , " as he was called  --  and he encouraged even the boys to address him as " Thorny "  --  was so headmasterly in every pleasing , comfortable , superficialway that no one could feel unfriendly toward him . He was a tall , broad-shouldered , white-haired man with a face as serviceable as an oar ; in fact , he was an oarsman , and an outdoorsman  --  a man who preferred soft , unironed trousers , maybe khakis or corduroys , and a tweed jacket with the elbow patches in need of a thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire winters , and was such a supporter of our teams  --  in the rawest weather  --  that he wore a scar from an errant hockey puck as proudly as a merit badge ; the puck had struck him above the eye while he 'd tended the goal during the annual Alumni-Varsity game . Thorny was an honorary member of several of Gravesend 's graduating classes . He played every alumni game in the goal . " Ice hockey 's not a sissy sport ! " he liked to say . In another vein , in defense of Owen Meany , he maintained : " It is the well educated who will improve society  --  and they will improve it , at first , by criticizing it , and we are giving them the tools to criticize it . Naturally , as students , the brighter of them will begin their improvements upon society by criticizing us . " To Owen , old Archie Thorndike would sing a slightly different song : " It is your responsibility to find fault with me , it is mine to hear you out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to change ; I 'm going to retire ! Get the new headmaster to make the changes ; that 's when I made changes  --  when I was new . " " WHAT CHANGES DID YOU MAKE ? " Owen Meany asked . " That 's another reason I 'm retiring ! " old Thorny told Owen amiably . " My memory 's shot ! "  |p267Owen  thought that Archibald Thorndike was a blithering , glad-handing fool ; but everyone , even The Voice , thought that old Thorny was a nice guy . " NICE GUYS ARE THE TOUGHEST TO GET RID OF , " Owen wrote for The Grave ; but even Mr. Early was smart enough to censor that . Then it was summer ; The Voice went back to work in the quarries  --  I do n't think he said much down in the pits  --  and I had my first job . I was a guide for the Gravesend Academy Admissions Office ; I showed the school to prospective students and their parents  --  it was boring , but it certainly was n't hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounted to the greatest responsibility anyone had given me , and I had freedom of choice regarding which typical classroom I would show , and which " typical " dormitory room . I chose rooms at random in Waterhouse Hall , in the vague hope that I might surprise Mr. and Mrs. Brinker-Smith at their game of musical beds ; but the twins were older now , and maybe the Brinker-Smiths did n't " do it " with their former gusto . In the evenings , at Hampton Beach , Owen looked tired to me ; I reported to the Admissions Office for my first guided tour at ten , but Owen was stepping into the grout bucket by seven every morning . His fingernails were cracked ; his hands were cut and swollen ; his arms were tanned and thin and hard . He did n't talk about Hester . The summer of ' 59 was the first summer that we met with any success in picking up girls ; or , rather , Owen met with this success , and he introduced the girls he met to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , I did n't , and  --  to my knowledge  --  Owen never had a date alone . " IT 'S A DOUBLE DATE OR IT 'S NOTHING , " he 'd tell one surprised girl after another . " ASK YOUR FRIEND OR FORGET IT . " And we were no longer afraid to cruise the pinball arcades around the casino on foot ; delinquent thugs would still pick on Owen , but he quickly established a reputation as an untouchable . " YOU WANT TO BEAT ME UP ? " he 'd say to some punk . " YOU WANT TO GO TO JAIL ? YOU 'RE SO UGLY  --  YOU THINK I 'LL HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING YOUR FACE ? " Then he 'd point to me . " YOU SEE HIM ? ARE YOU SUCH AN ASSHOLE YOU DO N'T KNOW WHAT A WITNESS IS ? GO AHEAD  --  BEAT ME UP ! " Only one guy did  --  or tried .

He tore one of the guy 's shoes ( ill Anil hit his toes ; there was a lot of blood , hut the guy was wearing ap268sock  --  I could n't see the actual damage , only that he had trouble walking . The guy was pulled off Owen by a cotton-candy vendor  --  he was arrested shortly thereafter for screaming obscenities , and we heard he was sent to reform school because he turned out to be driving a stolen car . We never saw him on the beachfront again , and the word about Owen  --  on the strip , around the casino , and along the boardwalk  --  was that he was dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd bitten off someone 's ear . Another summer , I heard that he 'd blinded a guy with a Popsicle stick . That these reports were n't exactly true did not matter at Hampton Beach . He was " that little dude in the red pickup , " he was " the quarry-worker  --  he carries some kind of tool on him . " He was " a mean little fucker  --  watch out for him . " We were seventeen ; we had a sullen summer . In the fall , Noah and Simon started college out on the West Coast ; they went to one of those California universities that no one on the East Coast can ever remember the name of . And the Eastmans continued their folly of considering Hester as less of an investment ; they sent her to the University of New Hampshire , where  --  as a resident  --  she merited in-state tuition . " They want to keep me in their own backyard , " was how Hester put it . " THEY PUT HER IN OUR BACKYARD , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twenty-minute drive from Gravesend . That it was a better university than the tanning club that Noah and Simon attended in California was not an argument that impressed Hester ; the boys got to travel , the boys got the more agreeable climate  --  she got to stay home . To New Hampshire natives , the state university  --  notwithstanding how basicallysolid an education it offered  --  was not exotic ; to Gravesend Academy students , with their elitist eyes on the Ivy League schools , it was " a cow college , " wholly beyond redemption . But in the fall of ' 59 , when Owen and I began our tenth-grade year at the academy , Owen was regarded as especially gifted  --  by our peers  --  because he was dating a college girl ; that Hester was a cow-college girl did not tarnish Owen 's reputation . He was Ladies ' Man Meany , he was Older-Woman Master ; and he was still and would always be The Voice . He demanded attention ; and he got it . Toronto : May 9 , 1987  --  Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campaign for the presidency after some Washington reporters caught him shacked up for the weekend with a Miami model ; although both the model and the candidate claimed that nothing " immoral " occurred  --  and Mrs. Hart said that she supported her husband , or maybe it was that she " understood " him  --  Mr. Hart decided that such intense scrutiny of his personal life created an " intolerable situation " for him and his family . He 'll be back ; want to het ? In the United States , no one like him disappears for long ; remember Nixon ?  |p269What  do Americans know about morality ? They do n't want their presidents to have penises but they do n't mind if their presidents covertly arrange to support the Nicaraguan rebel forces after Congress has restricted such aid ; they do n't want their presidents to deceive their wives but they do n't mind if their presidents deceive Congress  --  lie to the people and violate the people 's constitution ! What Mr. Hart should have said was that nothing unusually immoral had occurred , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was testing his abilities to deceive the American people by deceiving his wife first  --  and that he hoped the people would see by this example that he was immoral enough to be good presidential material ! I can just hear what The Voice would have said about all this . A sunny day ; my fellow Canadians in Winston Churchill Park have their bellies turned toward the sun . All the girls at Bishop Strachan are tugging up their middies and hiking up their pleated skirts ; they are pushing their knee socks down around their ankles ; the whole world wants a tan . But Owen hated the spring ; the warm weather made him think that school was almost over , and Owen loved school . When school was over , Owen Meany went back to the quarries . When school began again  --  when we started the fall term of 1959  --  I realized that The Voice had not been idle for the summer ; Owen came back to school with a stack of columns ready for The Grave . He charged the Search Committee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty and the students  --  " NOT A SERVANT OF THE ALUMNI AND THE TRUSTEES . " Although he made fun of Thorny  --  particularly , of old Archie Thorndike ' s notion of " the whole boy "  --  Owen praised our departing headmaster for being " AN EDUCATIOR FIRST , A FUND-RAISER SECOND . " Owen cautioned the Search Committee to " BEWARE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES  --  THEY 'LL PICK A HEADMASTER WHO CARES MORE ABOUT FUND DRIVES THAN THE CURRICULUMOR THE FACULTY WHO TEACH IT . AND DO N'T LISTEN TO THE ALUMNI ! " warned The Voice ; Owen had a low opinion of the alumni . " THEY CA N'T EVEN BE TRUSTED TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS REALLY LIKE TO BE HERE ; THEY 'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOL DID FOR THEM  --  OR HOW THE SCHOOL MADE SOMETHING OUT OF THEM , AS IF THEY WERE UNFORMED CLAY WHEN THEY CAME HERE . AS FOR HOW HARSH THE SCHOOL COULD BE , AS FOR HOW MISERABLE ' FI IEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE STUDEN'T 'S  --  THE ALUMNI HAVE CON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORGOTI'EN . " Someone in faculty meeting called Owen " that little turd " ; Danp270Needham argued that Owen truly adored the school , but that a Gravesend education did not and should not teach respect for uncritical love , for blind devotion . It became harder to defend Owen when he started the petition against fish on Fridays . " WE HAVE A NONDENOMINATIONAL CHURCH , " he stated . " WHY DO WE HAVE A CATHOLIC DINING HALL ? IF CATHOLICS WANT TO EAT FISH ON FRIDAY , WHY MUST THE REST OF US JOIN THEM ? MOST KIDS HATE FISH ! SERVE FISH BUT SERVE SOMETHING ELSE , TOO  --  COLD CUTS , OR EVEN PEANUT- , BUTTER-AND-JELLY SANDWICHES . WE ARE FREE TO LISTEN TO THE GUEST PREACHER AT HURD 'S CHURCH , OR WE CAN ATTEND ANY OF THE TOWN CHURCHES OF OUR CHOICE ; JEWS ARE N'T FORCED TO TAKE COMMUNION , UNITARIANS ARE N'T DRAGGED TO MASS  --  OR TO CONFESSION  --  BAPTISTS ARE N'T ROUNDED UP ON SATURDAYS AND HERDED OFF TO SYNAGOGUE ( OR TO THEIR OWN , UNWILLING CIRCUMCISIONS ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S EAT FISH OR GO HUNGRY . I THOUGHT THIS WAS A DEMOCRACY . ARE WE ALL FORCED TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CATHOLIC VIEW OF BIRTH CONTROL ? WHY ARE WE FORCED TO EAT CATHOLIC FOOD ? " He set up a chair and desk in the school post office to collect signatures for his petition  --  naturally , everyone signed it . " EVEN THE CATHOLICS SIGNED IT ! " announced The Voice . Dan Needham said that the food service manager put on quite a show in faculty meeting . " Next thing you know , that little turd will want a salad bar ! He 'll want an alternative to every menu  --  not just fish on Fridays ! " In his first column , The Voice had attacked MYSTERY MEAT ; now it was fish . " THIS UNJUST IMPOSITION ENCOURAGES RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION , " said The Voice ; Owen saw signs of anti-Catholicism springing up everywhere . " THERE 'S SOME BAD TALK GOING AROUND , " he reported . " THE CLIMATE OF THE SCHOOL IS BECOMING DISCRIMINATORY . I HEAR THE OFFENSIVE SLUR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIND OF TALK AROUND HERE . " Frankly , I never heard anyone use the term " mackerel-snapper "  --  except Owen ! And we could n't pass St. Michael 's  --  not to mention the sainted statue of Mary Magdalene  --  without his saying , " I WONDER WHAT THE PENGUINSARE UP TO ? DO YOU THINK THEY 'RE ALL LESBIANS ' ? " It was the first Friday following Thanksgiving vacation when they served cold cuts and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with the standard fish dish ; you could also get a howl of tomato soup , and potato salad . Ile had won . He got a standing ovation in the dining hall . As a scholarship boy , hep271had a job  --  he was a waiter at a faculty table ; the serving tray was half his size and he stood at attention beside it , as if it were a shield , while the students applauded him and the faculty smiled a trifle stiffly . Old Thorny called him into his office . " You know , I like you , little fella , " he told Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you some advice . Your friends do n't watch you as closely as your enemies  --  and you 've got enemies . You 've made more enemies in less than two years than I 've made in more than twenty ! Be careful you do n't give your enemies a way to get you . " Thorny wanted Owen to cox the varsity crew ; Owen was the perfect size for a coxswain , and  --  after all  --  he 'd grown up on the Squamscott . But Owen said that the racing shells had always offended his father  --  " IT 'S A MATTER OF BLOOD BEING THICKER THAN SCHOOL , " he told the headmaster ; furthermore , the river was polluted . In those days , the town did n't have a proper sewage system ; the textile mill , my late grandfather 's former shoe factory , and many private homes simply dumped their waste into the Squamscott . Owen said he had often seen " beetleskins " floating in the river ; beetleskins still gave him the shivers . Besides , in the fall he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the varsity or the junior varsity  --  but he had fun playing soccer , even on the lowest club-level . He was fast and scrappy  --  although , from all his smoking , he was easily winded . And in the spring  --  the other season for crew  --  Owen liked to play tennis ; he was n't very good , he was just a beginner , but my grandmother bought him a good racquet and Owen appreciated the orderliness of the game . The straight white lines , the proper tension in the net at its exactly correct height , the precise scoring . In the winter  --  God knows why !  --  he liked basketball ; perversely , perhaps , because it was a tall boy 's game . He played only in pickup games , to be sure  --  he could never have played on any of the teams  --  but he played with enthusiasm ; he was quite a leaper , he had a jump shot that elevated him almost to eye level with the other players , and he became obsessed with an impossible frill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slam-dunk . We did n't call it a " slamdunk " then ; we called it " stuffing " the ball , and there was n't very much of it  --  most kids were n't tall enough . Of course , Owen could never leap high enough to be above the basket ; to stuff the ball down into the basket was a nonsense idea he had  --  it was his absurd goal . Ile would devise an approach to the basket ; dribbling at good speed , he would time his leap to coincide with a teammate 's readiness to lift him higher he would jump into a teammate 's waiting arms , and the teammate would ( occasionally ) boost Owen above the basket 's rim . I was the only one who was willing to practice the timing with him ; it was such a ulirulous thing 14 him to want to do for someone his size to set himselfp272the challenge of soaring and reaching so high . . . it was just silliness , and I tired of the mindless , repetitive choreography . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It would never work in a game . It 's probably not even legal . I ca n't lift you up to the basket , I 'm sure that 's not allowed . " But Owen reminded me that I had once enjoyed lifting him up  --  at Sunday school . Now that it mattered to him , to get the timing of his leap adjusted to my lifting him even higher , why could n't I simply indulge him without criticizing him ? " I TOLERATED YOU LIFTING ME UP  --  ALL THOSE YEARS WHEN I ASKED YOU NOT TO ! " he said . " All those years , ' " I repeated . " It was only a few Sunday school classes , it was only for a couple of years  --  and we did n't do it every time . " But it was important to him now  --  this crazy lifting him up  --  and so we did it . It became a very well-rehearsed stunt with us ; " Slam-Dunk Meany , " some of the boys on the basketball team began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the move . Even the basketball coach was appreciative . " I may use you in a game , Owen , " the coach said , joking with him . " IT 'S NOT FOR A GAME , " said Owen Meany , who had his own reasons for everything . That Christmas vacation of ' 59 , we were in the Gravesend gym for hours every day ; we were alone , and undisturbed  --  all the boarders had gone home  --  and we were full of contempt for the Eastmans , who appeared to be making a point of not inviting us to Sawyer Depot . Noah and Simon had brought a friend home from California ; Hester was " in and out " ; and some old friend of my Aunt Martha , from her university days , " might " be visiting . The real reason we were not invited , Owen and I were sure , was that Aunt Martha wanted to discourage the relationship between Owen and Hester . Hester had told Owen that her mother referred to him as " the boy who hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of John 's "  --  and " that boy my mother is dressing up like a little doll . " But Hester thought so ill of her mother , and she was such a troublemaker , she might have made up all that and told Owen  --  chiefly so that Owen would dislike Aunt Martha , too . Owen did n't seem to care . I had been granted an extension to make up two late term papers over the vacation  --  so it was n't much of a vacation , anyway ; Owen helped me with the history paper and he wrote the English paper for me . " I PURPOSELY DID N'T SPELL EVERYTHING CORRECTLY . I MADE A FEW GRAMMATICALERRORS  --  OF THE KIND YOU USUALLY MAKE , " he told me . " I REPEATED MYSELF OCCASIONALLY , AND THERE 'S NOp273MENTION OF THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK  --  AS IF YOU SKIPPED THAT PART . THAT 'S THE PART YOU SKIPPED , RIGHT ? " It was a problem : how my in-class writing , my quizzes and examinations , were not at all as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we studied for all announced tests together , and I was  --  gradually  --  improving as a student . Because of my weak spelling I was enrolled in an extra , remedial course , which was marginally insulting , and  --  also because of my spelling , and my often erratic performance when I was called upon in the classroom  --  I was asked to see the school psychiatrist once a week . Gravesend Academy was used to good students ; when someone struggled , academically  --  even when one simply could n't spell properly !  --  it was assumed to be a matter for a shrink . The Voice had something to say about that , too . " IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PEOPLE WHO DO N'T LEARN AS EASILY AS OTHERS SUFFER FROM A KIND OF LEARNING DISABILITY  --  THERE IS SOMETHING THAT INTERFERES WITH THE WAY THEY PERCEIVE NUMBERS AND LETTERS , THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WAY THEY COMPREHEND UNFAMILIAR MATERIAL  --  BUTI FAIL TO SEE HOW THIS DISABILITY IS IMPROVEDBY PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION . WHAT SEEMS TO BE LACKING IS A TECHNICAL ABILITY THAT THOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SOMEONE SHOULD CONCRETELY STUDY THESE SKILLS AND TEACH THEM . WHAT DOES A SHRINK HAVE TO DO WITH THE PROCESS ? " These were the days before we 'd heard about dyslexia and other " learning disabilities " ; students like me were simply thought to be stupid , or slow . It was Owen who isolated my problem . " YOU 'RE MAINLY SLOW , " he said . " YOU 'RE ALMOST AS SMART AS I AM , BUT YOU NEED TWICE THE TIME . " The school psychiatrist  --  a retired Swiss gentleman who returned , every summer , to Zurich  --  was convinced that my difficulties as a student were the result of my best friend 's " murder " of my mother , and the " tensions and conflicts " that he saw as the " inevitable result " of my dividing my life between my grandmother and my stepfather . " At times , you must hate him  --  yes ? " Dr. Dolder mused . " Hate who ? " I asked . " My stepfather ? No  --  I love Dan ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate him . Yes ? " Dr. Dolder asked . " No ! " I said . " I love Owen  --  it was an accident . " " Yes , I know , " Dr. Dolder said . " But nonetheless . . . your grandmother , perhaps , she is a most difficult reminder  --  yes ' ? " " A ' reminder ' ? " I said . " I love my grandmother ! "  | " Yes , I know , " Dr. Dolder said . " But this baseball business  --  it 's most difficult , I imagine ... " " Yes ! " I said . " I hate baseball . " " Yes , for sure , " Dr. Dolder said . " I 've never seen a game , so it 's hardfor me to imagine exactly . . . perhaps we should take in a game together ? " " No , " I said . " I do n't play baseball , I do n't even watch it ! " " Yes , I see , " Dr. Dolder said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ca n't spell , " I said . " I 'm a slow reader , I get tired  --  I have to keepmy finger on the particular sentence , or I 'll lose my place ... " " It must be rather hard  --  a baseball , " Dr. Dolder said . " Yes ? " " Yes , it 's very hard , " I said ; I sighed . " Yes , I see , " Dr. Dolder said . " Are you tired now ? Are you getting tired ? " " It 's the spelling , " I told him . " The spelling and the reading . " There were photographs on the wall of his office in the Hubbard Infirmary  --  they were old black-and-white photographs of the clockfaces on the church spires in Zurich ; and photographs of the water birds in the Limmat , and of the people feeding the birds from those funny , arched footbridges . Many of the people wore hats ; you could almost hear those cathedral clocks sounding the hour . Dr. Dolder had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-white Vandyke beard was neatly trimmed , but the doctor often tugged its point . " A baseball , " he said thoughtfully . " Next time , you will bring a baseball  --  yes ? " " Yes , of course , " I said . " And this little baseball-hitter  --  The Voice , yes ?  --  I would very much like to talk to him , too , " said Dr. Dolder . " I 'll ask Owen if he 's free , " I said . " NOT A CHANCE , " said Owen Meany , when I asked him . " THERE 'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY SPELLING ! " Toronto : May 11 , 1987  --  I regret that I had the right change to get The Globe and Mail out of the street-corner box ; I had three dimes in my pocket , and a sentence in a front-page article proved irresistible . " It was unclear how Mr. Reagan intended to have his Administration maintain support for the contras while remaining within the law . " Since when did Mr. Reagan care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president would spend a weekend with a Miami model ; he could do a lot less harm that way . Think how relieved the Nicaraguans would he , if only for a weekend ! We ought to find a model for the president to spend every weekend with !

With what fervor do they relish bringing their sexual misconduct to light ! A pity that they do not bring their moral outrage to bear on their president 's arrogance above the law ; a pity that they do not unleash their moral zest on an administration that runs guns to terrorists . But , of course , boudoir morality takes less imagination , and can be indulged in without the effort of keeping up with world affairs  --  or even bothering to know " the whole story " behind the sexual adventure . It 's sunny again in Toronto today ; the fruit trees are blossoming  --  especially the pears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showers . Owen liked the rain . In the summer , in the bottom of a quarry , it could be brutally hot , and the dust was always a factor ; the rain cooled the rock slabs , the rain held the dust down . " ALL QUARRYMEN LIKE RAIN , " said Owen Meany . I told my Grade 12 English class that they should reread what Hardy called the first " phase " of Tess of the d ' Urbervilles , the part called " The Maiden " ; although I had drawn their attention to Hardy 's fondness for foreshadowing , the class was especially sleepyheaded at spotting these devices . How could they have read over the death of the horse so carelessly ? " Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself , " Hardy writes ; he even says , " Her face was dry and pale , as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess . " And what did the class make of Tess 's physical appearance ? " It was a luxuriance of aspect , a fullness of growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really was . " They made nothing of it . " Do n't some of you look like that  --  to yourselves ? " I asked the class . " What do you think about when you see one of yourselves who looks like that ? " Silence . And what did they think happened at the end of the first " phase "  --  was Tess seduced , or was she raped ? " She was sleeping soundly , " Hardy writes . Does he mean that d'Urberville " did it " to her when she was asleep ? Silence . Before they trouble themselves to read the second " phase " of Tess , called " Maiden No More , " I suggested that they trouble themselves to reread " The Maiden "  --  or , perhaps , read it for the first time , as the case may he ! " Pay attention , " I warned them . " When Tess says , Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel ' ? '  --  pay attention ! Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby cot ner of God 's allotment where he lets the nettles grow , and where allp276unbaptized infants , notorious drunkards , suicides , and others of the conjecturally damned are laid . ' Ask yourself what Hardy thinks of God 's allotment '  --  and what does he think of bad luck , of coincidence , of so-called circumstances beyond our control ? And does he imagine that being a virtuous character exposes you to greater or fewer liabilities as you roam the world ? " " Sir ? " said Leslie Ann Grew . That was very old-fashioned of her ; it 's been years since anyone called me " Sir " at Bishop Strachan  --  unless it was a new kid . Leslie Ann Grew has been here for years . " If it 's another nice day tomorrow , " said Leslie Ann , " can we have class outside ? " " No , " I said ; but I 'm so slow  --  I feel so dull . I know what The Voice would have told her . " ONLY IF IT RAINS , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEN WE CAN HAVE CLASS OUTSIDE . " At the start of the winter term of our tenth-grade year at Gravesend Academy , the school 's gouty minister  --  the Rev. Mr. Scammon , the officiant of the academy 's nondenominational faith and the lackluster teacher of our Religion and Scripture classes  --  cracked his head on the icy steps of Hurd 's Church and failed to regain consciousness . Owen was of the opinion that the Rev. Mr. Scammon never was fully conscious . For weeks after his demise , his vestments and his cane hung from the coat tree in the vestry office  --  as if old Mr. Scammon had journeyed no farther from this world than to the adjacent toilet . The Rev. Lewis Merrill was hired as his temporary replacement in our Religion and Scripture classes , and a Search Committee was formed to find a new school minister . Owen and I had suffered through Religion One together in our ninthgradeyear : old Mr. Scammon 's sweeping , Caesar-to-Eisenhower approach to the major religions of the world . We had been suffering Scammon 's Scripture course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hurd 's Church rose to meet him . The Rev. Mr. Merrill brought his familiar stutter and his almost-as-familiar doubts to both courses . In Scripture , he set us to work in our Bibles  --  to find plentiful examples of Isaiah 5:20 : " Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil . " In Religion Two  --  a heavy-reading course in " religion and literature "  --  we were instructed to divine Tolstoy 's meaning : " There was no solution , " Tolstoy writes in Anna Karenina , " but the universal solution that life gives to all questions , even the most complex and insoluble . That answer is : one must live in the needs of the day  --  that is forget oneself . " In both classes , Pastor Merrill preached his **62;16997;TOOLONG ; it was a point of view that interested Owen more than it had once interested him . The apparent secret was " belief without miracles " ; a faith that needed a miracle was not a faith at all . Do n't ask for proof  --  that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A LITTLE PROOF , " said Owen Meany . " Faith itself is a miracle , Owen , " said Pastor Merrill . " The first miracle that I believe in is my own faith itself . " Owen looked doubtful , but he did n't speak . Our Religion Two class  --  and our Scripture class , too  --  was an atheistic mob ; except for Owen Meany , we were such a negative , anti-everything bunch of morons that we thought Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg were more interesting writers than Tolstoy . And so the Rev. Lewis Merrill , with his stutter and his well-worn case of doubt , had his hands full with us . He made us read Greene 's The Power and the Glory  --  Owen wrote his term paper on " THE WHISKEY PRIEST : A SEEDY SAINT . " We also read Joyce 's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Lagerkvist 's Barabbas and Dostoevski 's The Brothers Karamazov  --  Owen wrote my term paper on " SIN AND SMERDYAKOV : A LETHAL COMBINATION . " Poor Pastor Merrill ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity 's defender  --  and even Owen argued with the terms of Mr. Merrill 's defense . The class loved Sartre and Camus  --  the concept of " the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation " was thrilling to us teenagers . The Rev. Mr. Merrill countered humbly with Kierkegaard : " What no person has a right to is to delude others into the belief that faith is something of no great significance , or that it is an easy matter , whereas it is the greatest and most difficult of all things . " Owen , who 'd had his doubts about Pastor Merrill , found himself in the role of the minister 's defender . " JUST BECAUSE A BUNCH OF ATHEISTS ARE BETTER WRITERS THAN THE GUYS WHO WROTE THE BIBLE DOES N'T NECESSARILY MAKE THEM RIGHT ! " he said crossly . " LOOK AT THOSE WEIRDO TV **28;17061;TOOLONG TO GET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN MAGIC ! BUT THE REAL MIRACLES ARE N'T ANYTHING YOU CAN SEE  --  THEY 'RE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE WITHOUT SEEING . IF SOME PREACHER 'S AN ASSHOLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Yes , but let 's not say asshole ' in class , Owen , " Pastor Merrill said . And in our Scripture class , Owen said , " IT 'S TRUE THAT THE DISCIPLES ARE STUPID  --  THEY NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT JESUS MEANS , THEY 'RE A BUNCH OF BUNGLERS , THEY DO N'T BELIEVE IN GOD AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO BELIEVE , AND THEY EVEN BETRAY JESUS . THE I'OINT IS , GOD DOES N'T LOVE US BECAUSE WE 'RE SMART OR BECAUSE WE 'RE GOOD . WE 'RE STUPID AND WE 'RE BAD AND GOD LOVES US ANYWAY JESUSp278ALREADY TOLD THE DUMB-SHIT DISCIPLES WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN . ' THE SON OF MAN WILL BE DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF MEN , AND THEY WILL KILL HIM ... ' REMEMBER ? THAT WAS IN MARK  --  RIGHT ? " " Yes , but let 's not say ' dumb-shit disciples ' in class , Owen , " Mr. Merrill said ; but although he struggled to defend God 's Holy Word , Lewis Merrill  --  for the first time , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faith assailed perked him up ; he was livelier and less meek . " I DO N'T THINK THE CONGREGATIONALISTS EVER TALK TO HIM , " Owen suggested . " I THINK HE 'S LONELY FOR CONVERSATION ; EVEN IF ALL HE GETS IS AN ARGUMENT , AT LEAST WE 'RE TALKING TO HIM . " " I see no evidence that his wife ever talks to him , " Dan Needham observed . And the monosyllabic utterances of Pastor Merrill 's surly children were not of the engaging tones that invited conversation . " WHY DOES THE SCHOOL WASTE ITS TIME WITH TWO SEARCH COMMITTEES ? " asked The Voice in The Grave . " FIND A HEADMASTER  --  WE NEED A HEADMASTER  --  BUT WE DO N'T NEED A SCHOOL MINISTER . WITH NO DISRESPECT FOR THE DEAD , THE REV . LEWIS MERRILL IS A MORE-THAN-ADEQUATE REPLACEMENT FOR THE LATE MR . SCAMMON : FRANKLY , MR . MERRILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CLASSROOM . AND THE SCHOOL THINKS WELL ENOUGH OF HIS POWERS IN THE PULPIT TO HAVE ALREADY INVITED HIM TO BE THE GUEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE REV . MR . MERRILL WOULD BE A GOOD SCHOOL MINISTER . WE SHOULD FIND OUT WHAT THE CONGREGATIONALISTS ARE PAYING HIM AND OFFER HIM MORE . " And so they hired him away from the Congregationalists ; once more , The Voice did not go unheard . Toronto : May 12 , 1987  --  a sunny , cool day , a good day to mow a lawn . The smell of freshly cut grass all along Russell Hill Road reflects how widespread is my neighbors ' interest in lawnmowing . Mrs. Brocklebankwhosedaughter , Heather , is in my Grade 12 English class  --  took a slightly different approach to her lawn ; I found her ripping her dandelions out by their roots . " You 'd better do the same thing , " she said to me . " Pull them out , do n't mow them under . If you chop them up with the mower , you 'll just make more of them . " " Like starfish , " I said ; I should have known better it 's never a goodp279idea to introduce Mrs. Brocklebank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill . If I 'd assigned " The Maiden " to Mrs. Brocklebank , she would have gotten everything right  --  the first time . " What do you know about starfish ? " she asked . " I grew up on the seacoast , " I reminded her . It is occasionally necessary for me to tell Torontonians of the presence of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans ; they tend to think of the Great Lakes as the waters of the world . " So what about starfish ? " Mrs. Brocklebank asked . " You cut them up , they grow more starfish , " I said . " Is that in a book ? " asked Mrs. Brocklebank . I assured her that it was . I even have a book that describes the life of the starfish , although Owen and I knew not to chop them up long before we read about them ; every kid in Gravesend learned all about starfish at the beach at Little Boar 's Head . I remember my mother telling Owen and me not to cut them up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not encouraged in New Hampshire . Mrs. Brocklebank is persistent regarding new information ; she goes after everything as aggressively as she attacks her dandelions . " I 'd like to see that book , " she announced . And so I began again with what has become a fairly routine labor : discouraging Mrs. Brocklebank from reading another book  --  I work as hard at discouraging her , and with as little success , as I sometimes labor to encourage those BSS girls to read their assignments . " It 's not a very good book , " I said . " It 's written by an amateur ; it 's published by a vanity press . " " So what 's wrong with an amateur writing a book ? " Mrs. Brocklebank wanted to know . She is probably writing one of her own , it occurs to me now . " So what 's wrong with a vanity press ' ? " she asked . The book that tells the truth about the starfish is called The Life of the Tidepool by Archibald Thorndike . Old Thorny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he retired from Gravesend Academy , he spent two years scrutinizing a tidepool in Rye Harbor ; at his own expense , he published a book about it and sold autographed copies of the book every Alumni Day . He parked his station wagon by the tennis courts and sold his books off the tailgate , chatting with all the alumni who wanted to talk to him ; since he was a very popular headmaster  --  and since he was replaced by a particularly unpopular headmaster  --  almost all the alumni wanted to talk to old Thorny . I suppose he sold a lot of copies of The Life of the I'idi pool ; he might even have made money . Maybe he was n't such an amateur , after all . lie knew how to handle The Voice  --  by not handling him . And The Voice would prove to he the undoing of the new headmaster , in the end.  |p280In  the end , I yielded to Mrs. Brocklebank 's frenzy to educate herself ; I said I 'd lend her my copy of The Life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first phase ' of Tess , " I told Mrs. Brocklebank . " Heather 's not reading her assignments ? " Mrs. Brocklebank asked in alarm . " It 's spring , " I reminded her . " All the girls are n't reading their assignments . Heather 's doing just fine . " Indeed , Heather Brocklebank is one of my better students ; she has inherited her mother 's ardor  --  while , at the same time , her imagination ranges far beyond dandelions . In a flash , I think of giving my Grade 12 English class a sneak quiz ; if they gave the first " phase " of Tess such a sloppy reading , I 'll bet they skipped the Introduction altogether  --  and I had assigned the Introduction , too ; I do n't always do that , but there 's an Introduction by Robert B. Heilman that 's especially helpful to first readers of Hardy . I know a really nasty quiz question ! I think  --  looking at Mrs. Brocklebank , clutching her murdered dandelions . " What was Thomas Hardy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing they could ever guess ; if they 'd read the Introduction , they 'd know it was Too Late Beloved  --  they 'd at least remember the " too late " part . Then I remembered that Hardy had written a story  --  before Tess  --  called " The Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid " ; I wondered if I could throw in that title , to confuse them . Then I remembered that Mrs. Brocklebank was standing on the sidewalk with her handful of dandelions , waiting for me to fetch her The Life of the Tidepool . And last of all I remembered that Owen Meany and I first read Tess of the d ' Urbervilles in our tenth-grade year at Gravesend Academy ; we were in Mr. Early 's English class  --  it was the winter term of 1960  --  and I was struggling with Thomas Hardy to the point of tears . Mr. Early was a fool to try Tess on tenth graders . At Bishop Strachan , I have long argued with my colleagues that we should teach Hardy in Grade 13  --  even Grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier than Tess ! " I ca n't read this ! " I remember saying to Owen . He tried to help me ; he helped me with everything else , but Tess was simply too difficult . " I ca n't read about milking cows ! " I screamed . " IT 'S NOT ABOUT MILKING COWS , " Owen said crossly . " I do n't care what it 's about ; I hate it , " I said . " THAT 'S A TRULY INTELLIGENT ATTITUDE , " Owen said . " IF YOU CA N'T READ IT , DO YOU WANT ME TO READ IT ALOUD TO YOU ? " I am so ashamed of myself to remember this : that he would do even that for me  --  that he would read Tess of the d ' Urbervilles aloud to me ! At thep281time , the thought of hearing that whole novel in his voice was staggering . " I ca n't read it and I ca n't listen to it , either , " I said . " FINE , " Owen said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY , I CAN WRITE YOUR TERM PAPER  --  AND IF THERE 'S AN EXAM , YOU 'LL JUST HAVE TO BULLSHIT AS WELL AS YOU CAN : IF I TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY , MAYBE YOU 'LL ACTUALLY REMEMBER SOME OF IT . THE POINT IS , I CAN DO YOUR HOMEWORK FOR YOU  --  IT 'S NOT HARD FOR ME AND I DO N'T MIND DOING IT  --  OR I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK . THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARDER  --  FOR BOTH OF US  --  BUT IT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE USEFUL FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR OWN WORK . I MEAN , WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO  --  AFTER I 'M GONE ? " " What do you mean , after you 're gone ? " I asked him . " LOOK AT IT ANOTHER WAY , " he said patiently . " ARE YOU GOING TO GET A JOB ? AFTER YOU 'RE THROUGH WITH SCHOOL , I MEAN  --  ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ? ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GO TO THE SAME UNIVERSITY ? AM I GOING TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK THERE , TOO ? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAJOR IN ? " " What are you going to major in ? " I asked him ; my feelings were hurt  --  but I knew what he was driving at , and he was right . " GEOLOGY , " he said . " I 'M IN THE GRANITE BUSINESS . " " That 's crazy ! " I said . " It 's not your business . You can study anything you want , you do n't have to study rocks ! " " ROCKS ARE INTERESTING , " Owen said stubbornly . " GEOLOGY IS THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH . " " I ca n't read Tess of the d'Urbervilles ! " I cried . " It 's too hard ! " " YOU MEAN IT 'S HARD TO MAKE YOURSELF READ IT , YOU MEAN IT 'S HARD TO MAKE YOURSELF PAY ATTENTION , " he said . " BUT IT 'S NOT TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES THAT 'S HARD . THOMAS HARDY MAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE 'S OBVIOUS , HE TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TO KNOW . " " He tells me more than I want to know ! " I cried . " YOUR BOREDOM IS YOUR PROBLEM , " said Owen Meany . " IT 'S YOUR LACK OF IMAGINATION THAT BORES YOU . HARDY HAS THE WORLD FIGURED OUT . TESS IS DOOMED . FATE HAS IT IN FOR HER . SHE 'S A VICTIM ; IF YOU 'RE A VICTIM , THE WORLD WILL USE YOU . WHY SHOULD SOMEONE WHO 'S GOT SUCH A WORKED OUT WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD BORE YOU ? WHYp282SHOULD N'T YOU BE INTERESTED IN SOMEONE WHO 'S WORKED OUT A WAY TO SEE THE WORLD ? THAT 'S WHAT MAKES WRITERS INTERESTING ! MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE AN ENGLISH MAJOR . AT LEAST , YOU GET TO READ STUFF THAT 'S WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO CAN WRITE ! YOU DO N'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHINGTO BE AN ENGLISH MAJOR , YOU DO N'T NEED ANY SPECIAL TALENT , YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT SOMEONE WANTS YOU TO SEE  --  TO WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAY . IT 'S SO EASY ; I THINK THAT 'S WHY THERE ARE SO MANY ENGLISH MAJORS . " " It 's not easy for me ! " I cried . " I hate reading this book ! " " DO YOU HATE TO READ MOST BOOKS ? " Owen asked me . " Yes ! " I said . " DO YOU SEE THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT TESS ? " he asked me . " Yes , " I admitted . " NOW WE 'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE , " said Owen Meany  --  my friend , my teacher . Standing on the sidewalk with Mrs. Brocklebank , I felt the tears start to come . " Do you have allergies ? " Mrs. Brocklebank asked me ; I shook my head . I feel so ashamed of myself that  --  even for a moment  --  I could consider zapping my Grade 12 girls with a nasty quiz on Tess of the d ' Urbervilles . Remembering how I suffered as a student , remembering how much I needed Owen 's help , how could I even think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an allergy , " Mrs. Brocklebank concluded from my tears . " Lots of people have allergies and do n't even know ; I 've read about that . " " It must be the dandelions , " I said ; and Mrs. Brocklebank glared at the pestilential weeds with a fresh hatred . Every spring there are dandelions ; they always remind me of the spring term of 1960  --  the burgeoning of that old decade that once seemed so new to Owen Meany and me . That was the spring when the Search Committee found a new headmaster . That was the decade that would defeat us . Randolph White had been the headmaster of a small private day school in Lake Forest , Illinois ; I 'm told that is a super-rich and exclusively WASP community that does its utmost to pretend it is not a suburb of Chicago  --  but that may be unfair ; I 've never been there . Several Gravesend students came from there , and they unanimously groaned to hear the announcement of Randolph White 's appointment as headmaster at the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed them to New Hampshire depressed them . At the time , Owen and I knew a kid from Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , and he told us that Bloomfield Hills was to Detroit what Lake Forest was to Chicago , and that  --  in his view  --  Bloomfield Hills " sucked " ; he offered a story about Bloomfield Hills as an example of what he meant  --  it was a story about a black family that moved there , and they were forced to sell and move out because their neighbors kept burning crosses on their lawn . This shocked Owen and me ; in New Hampshire , we thought such things happened only in the South  --  but a black kid from Atlanta informed us that we knew " shit " about the problem ; they burned crosses all over the country , the black kid said , and we were n't exactly " overwhelmed by a sea of black faces " at Gravesend Academy , were we ? No , Owen and I agreed ; we were not . Then another kid from Michigan said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago  --  that Bloomfield Hills was n't a proper analogy  --  and some other kid argued that Shaker Heights was more to Cleveland what Lake Forest was to Chicago . . . and so forth . Owen and I were not very knowledgeable of the geography of the country 's rich and exclusive ; when a Jewish kid from Highland Park , Illinois , told us that there were " no Jews allowed " in Lake Forest , Owen and I began to wonder what ominous kind of small private day school in Lake Forest our new headmaster had come from . Owen had another reason to be suspicious of Randolph White . Of all the candidates whom the Search Committee dragged through the school in our tenth-grade year , only Randolph White had not accepted the invitation for A PRIVATE AUDIENCE with The Voice . Owen had met Mr. White outside Archie Thorndike 's office ; Thorny introduced the candidate to The Voice and told them he would , as usual , vacate his office in order for them to be alone for Owen 's interview . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I already had thestudent interview . " " Well , " old Thorny said , " Owen , you know , is The Voice  --  you know our school newspaper , The Grave ? " " I know who he is , " Mr. White said ; he had still not shaken Owen 's outstretched hand . " Why did n't he interview me when the other students interviewed me ' ? " " That was the student subcommittee , " Archie Thorndike explained . " Owen has requested ' a private audience ' ... " " Request denied , Owen , " said Randolph White , finally shaking Owen 's small hand . " I want to have plenty of time to talk with the departmentp284heads , " Mr. White explained ; Owen rubbed his fingers , which were still throbbing from the candidate 's handshake . Old Thorny tried to salvage the disaster . " Owen is almost a department head , " he said cheerfully . " Student opinion is n't a department , is it ? " Mr. White asked Owen , who was speechless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aggressive , relentless game of squash  --  daily . His wife called him " Randy " ; he called her " Sam "  --  from Samantha . She came from a " meat money " family in the Chicago area ; his was a " meat family " background , too  --  although there was said to be more money in the meat she came from . One of the less-than-kind Chicago newspapers described their wedding as a " meat marriage . " Owen remembered from the candidate 's dossier that White had been credited with " revolutionizing packaging and distribution of meat products " ; he 'd left meat for education rather recently  --  when his own children ( in his opinion ) were in need of a better school ; he 'd started one up , from scratch , and the school had been quite a success in Lake Forest . Now White 's children were in college and White was looking for a " bigger challenge in the education business . " In Lake Forest , he 'd had no " tradition " to work with ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change-maker within a great tradition . " Randy White dressed like a businessman ; he looked exceedingly sharp alongside old Archie Thorndike 's more rumpled and wrinkled appearance . White wore a steel-gray , pin-striped suit with a crisp white shirt ; he liked a thin , gold collar pin that pulled the unusually narrow points of his collar a little too closely together  --  the pin also thrust the perfectly tight knot of his necktie a little too far forward . He put his hand on top of Owen Meany 's head and rumpled Owen 's hair ; before the famous Nativity of ' 53 , Barb Wiggin used to do that to Owen . " I 'll talk to Owen after I get the job ! " White said to old Thorny . He smiled at his own joke . " I know what Owen wants , anyway , " White said ; he winked at Owen . " An educator first , a fund-raiser second '  --  is n't that it ? " Owen nodded , but he could n't speak . " Well , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision-maker . He 's both an educator and a fund-raiser , but  --  first and foremost  --  he makes decisions . " Then Randy White looked at his watch ; he steered old Thorny back into the headmaster 's office . " Remember , I 've got that plane to catch , " White said . " Let 's get those department heads together . " And just before old Archie Thorndike closed his office door , Owen heard what White said ; in Owen 's view , he was supposed to hear what White said . " I hope that kid has n't stopped growing , " said Randy White . Then the door to the headmaster 's office was closed ; The Voice was left speechless ; the candidate had not heard a word from Owen Meany.  |p285Of  course , the Ghost of the Future saw it coming ; sometimes I think Owen saw everything that was coming . I remember how he predicted that the school would pick Randolph White . For The Grave , The Voice titled his column " WHITEWASH . " He began : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FACULTY ARE A BUNCH OF TYPICAL TEACHERS  --  INDECISIVE , WISITYWASHY , THEY 'RE ALWAYS SAYING ' ON THE OTHER HAND . ' NOW ALONG COMES THIS GUY WHO SAYS HIS SPECIALTY IS MAKING DECISIONS . ONCE HE STARTS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS , HE 'LL DRIVE EVERYONE CRAZY  --  WAIT UNTIL EVERYONESEES WHAT BRILLIANT DECISIONS THE GUY COMES UP WITH ! BUT RIGHT NOW , EVERYONE THINKS SOMEONE WHO MAKES DECISIONS IS JUST WHAT WE NEED . RIGHT NOW , EVERYONE 'S A SUCKER FOR A DECISION-MAKER , " Owen wrote . " WHAT GRAVESEND NEEDS IS A HEADMASTER WITH A STRONG EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND ; MR . WHITE 'S BACKGROUND IS MEAT . " There was more , and it was worse . Owen suggested that someone check int9 the admissions policy at the small private day school in Lake Forest ; were there any Jews or blacks in Mr. White 's school ? Mr. Early , in his capacity as faculty adviser to The Grave , killed the column ; the part about the faculty being " TYPICAL TEACHERS  --  INDECISIVE , WISITYWASHY " . . . that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the column should have been killed . " You ca n't imply that someone is a racist or an anti-Semite , Owen , " Dan told him . " You have to have proof . " Owen sulked about such a stem rejection from The Grave ; but he took Dan 's advice seriously . He talked to the Gravesend students who came from Lake Forest , Illinois ; he encouraged them to write to their mothers and fathers and urge them to inquire about the admissions policy at Mr. White 's school . The parents could pretend they were considering the school for their children ; they could even ask directly if their children were going to be rubbing shoulders with blacks or Jews . The result  --  the unhappily secondandthirdhand information  --  was typically unclear ; the parents were told that the school had " no specific admissions policy " ; they were also told that the school had no blacks or Jews . Dan Needham had his own story about meeting Randy White ; that was after White was offered the job . It was a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom  --  and Dan Needham was walking in the main quadrangle with Randy White and his wife , Sam ; it was Sam 's first visit to the school , and she was interested in the theater . Almost immediately upon the Whites ' arrival , Mr. White made his decision to accept the headmastershipDan said the school had never looked prettier . The grass was trim andp286a spring-green color , but it had not been mowed so recently that it looked shorn ; the ivy was glossy against the red-brick buildings , and the arborvitae and the privet hedges that outlined the quadrangle paths stood in uniform , dark-green contrast to the few , bright-yellow dandelions . Dan let the new headmaster maul the fingers of his right hand ; Dan looked into the pretty-blonde blandness of Sam 's vacant , detached smile . " Look at those dandelions , dear , " said Randolph White . " They should be ripped out by their roots , " Mrs. White said decisively . " They should , they should  --  and they will be ! " said the new headmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given him the shivers . " YOU THINK THEY GIVE YOU THE SHIVERS NOW , " Owen said . " JUST WAIT UNTIL HE STARTS MAKING DECISIONS ! " Toronto : May 13 , 1987  --  another gorgeous day , sunny and cool ; Mrs. Brocklebank and others of my neighbors who were attacking their dandelions , yesterday , are having a go at their lawns today . It smells as fresh as a farm along Russell Hill Road and Lonsdale Road . I read The Globe and Mail again , but I was good ; I did n't bring it to school with me , and I resolved that I would not discuss the sales of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of the profits to the Nicaraguan rebels  --  or the gift from the sultan of Brunei that was supposed to help support the rebels but was instead transferred to the wrong account in a Swiss bank . A ten-million-dollar " mistake " ! The Globe and Mail said : " Brunei was only one foreign country approached during the Reagan Administration 's attempt to find financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being spent on their behalf by the U.S. Government . " But in my Grade 13 English class , the ever-clever Claire Clooney read that sentence aloud to the class and then asked me if I did n't think it was " the awkwardest sentence alive . " I have encouraged the girls to find clumsy sentences in newspapers and magazines , and to bring them into class for our hearty ridicule  --  and that bit about " any money 's being spent " is enough to turn an English teacher 's eyeballs a blank shade of pencil-gray  --  but I knew that Claire Clooney was trying to get me started ; I resisted the bait . It is that time in the spring term when the minds of the Grade 13 girls are elsewhere , and I reminded them that  --  yesterday  --  we had not traveled sufficiently far in our perusal of Chapter Three of The Great Gatsby ; that the class had bogged down in a mire of interpretations regarding the " quality of eternal reassurance " in Gatsby 's smile ; and that we 'd wasted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting " an urban distaste for the concrete . " Claire Clooney , I might add , has suchp287a general " distaste for the concrete " that she confused Daisy Buchanan with Myrtle Wilson . I suggested that mistaking a wife for a mistress was of more dire substance than a slip of the tongue . I suspect that Claire Clooney is too clever for an error of this magnitude ; that , yesterday , she had not read past Chapter One ; and that , today  --  by her ploy of distracting me with the news  --  she was not finished with Chapter Four . " Here 's another one , Mr. Wheelwright , " Claire Clooney said , continuingher merciless attack on The Globe and Mail . " This is the secondawkwardestsentence alive , " she said . " Get this : ' Mr. Reagan denied yesterday that he had solicited third-country aid for the rebels , as Mr. McFarlane had said on Monday . ' That 's some dangling clunker there , is n't it ? " Claire Clooney asked me . " I like that , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tacked on to the sentence ! " she cried . " Is it ' like tacked on ' or is it tacked on ? " I asked her . She smiled ; the other girls tittered . They were not going to get me to blow a forty-minute class on Ronald Reagan . But I had to keep my hands under the desk  --  my fists under the desk , I should say . The White House , that whole criminal mob , those arrogant goons who see themselves as justified to operate above the law  --  they disgrace democracy by claiming that what they do they do for democracy ! They should be in jail . They should be in Hollywood ! I know that some of the girls have told their parents that I deliver " ranting lectures " to them about the United States ; some parents have complained to the headmistress , and Katherine has cautioned me to keep my politics out of the classroom --  " or at least say something about Canada ; BSS girls are Canadians , for the most part , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . " I know you do n't ! " the Rev. Mrs. Keeling says , laughing ; she is always friendly , even when she 's teasing me , but the substance of her remark hurts me  --  if only because it is the same , critical message that Canon Mackie delivers to me , without cease . In short : You 've been with us for twenty years ; when are you going to take an interest in us ? In my Grade 13 English class , Frances Noyes said : " I think he 's lying . " She meant President Reagan , of course . " They should impeach him . Why ca n't they impeach him ? " said Debby LaRocca . " If he 's lying , they should impeach him . If he 's not lying  --  if all these other clowns are running his administration for him  --  then he 's too stupid to he president . Either way , they should impeach him . In Canada , they 'd call for a vote of confidence and he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What do you think , Mr. Wheelwright ' ? " Adrienne Hewlett asked me sweetly . " I think that some of you have not read to the end of Chapter four , " 1p288said . " What does it mean that Gatsby was delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor '  --  what does that mean ? " I asked them . At least Ruby Newell had done her homework . " It means that Gatsby bought the house so that Daisy would be just across the bay  --  that all the parties he throws . . . in a way , he throws them for her . It means that he 's not just crazy  --  that he 's made all the money , and he 's spending all the money , just for her ! To catch her eye , you know ? " Ruby said . " I like the part about the guy who fixed the World Series ! " Debby LaRocca cried . " Meyer Wolfshears ! " said Claire Clooney. " - shiem , " I said softly . " Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I like the way he says Oggsford ' instead of Oxford , " Debby LaRocca said . " Like he thinks Gatsby 's an Oggsford man , ' " said Frances Noyes . " I think the guy who 's telling the story is a snob , " said Adrienne Hewlett . " Nick , " I said softly . " Nick Carraway . " " Yeah , " Sandra Darcy said . " But he 's supposed to be a snob  --  that 's part of it . " " And when he says he 's so honest , that he 's one of the few honest people ' he 's ever known , I think we 're not supposed to trust him  --  not completely , I mean , " Claire Cooney said . " I know he 's the one telling the story , but he 's a part of them  --  he 's judging them , but he 's one of them . " " They 're trashy people , all of them , " Sandra Darcy said . " Trashy ' ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby Newell said correctly . " Yes , " I said . " They certainly are . " Very smart , these BSS girls . They know what 's going on in The Great Gatsby , and they know what should be done to Ronald Reagan 's rotten administration , too ! But I contained myself very well in class today . I restricted my observations to The Great Gatsby . I bade the class to look with special care in the following chapters at Gatsby 's notion that he can " repeat the past , " at Gatsby 's observation of Daisy  --  that " her voice is full of money "  --  and at the frequency of how often Gatsby appears in moonlight ( once , at the end of Chapter Seven , " watching over nothing " ) . I asked them to consider the coincidence of Nick 's thirtieth birthday ; the meaning of the sentence " Before me stretched the portentous , menacing road of a new decade " might give our class as much trouble as the meaning of " an urban distaste for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told them . " They 're very careless ' people . " Ruby Newell smiled ; " careless " is how Fitzgerald himselfp289described those characters ; Ruby knew that I knew she had already read to the end of the book . " They were careless people , " the book says " . . . they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness , or whatever it was that kept them together , and let other people clean up the mess they had made .... " The Reagan administration is full of such " careless people " ; their kind of carelessness is immoral . And President Reagan calls himself a Christian ! How does he dare ? The kind of people claiming to be in communication with God today . . . they are enough to drive a real Christian crazy ! And how about these evangelical types , performing miracles for money ? Oh , there 's big bucks in interpreting the gospel for idiots  --  or in having idiots interpret the gospel for you  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sexual activity that would embarrass former Senator Hart . Perhaps poor Gary Hart missed his true calling , or are they all the same  --  these presidential candidates and evangelicals who are caught with their pants down ? Mr. Reagan has been caught with his pants down , too  --  but the American people reserve their moral condemnation for sexual misconduct . Remember when the country was killing itself in Vietnam , and the folks at home were outraged at the length and cleanliness of the protesters ' hair ? In the staff room , Evelyn Barber , one of my colleagues in the English Department , asked me what I thought of the contra-aid article in The Globe and Mail . I said I thought that the Reagan administration exhibited " an urban distaste for the concrete . " That got quite a few laughs from my colleagues , who were expecting a diatribe from me ; on the one hand , they complain about my " predictable politics , " but they are just like the students  --  they enjoy getting me riled up . I have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been a maturing influence on any of them , but they have turned me and my colleagues into teenagers . We teenagers are much maligned ; for example , we would not keep Mr. Reagan in office . In the staff room , my colleagues were yapping about the school elections ; the elections were yesterday , when I noticed an impatient thrill in morning chapel  --  before the balloting for head girl . The girls sang " Sons of God " with even more pep than usual ; how I love to hear them sing that hymn ! " There are verses only the voices of young girls can convincingly sing . Brothers , sisters , we are one , and our life has just begun ; in the Spirit we are young , we can live for ever !  |p290It  was Owen Meany who taught me that any good book is always in motion  --  from the general to the specific , from the particular to the whole , and back again . Good reading  --  and good writing about reading  --  moves the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example , who showed me how to write a term paper , describing the incidents that determine Tess 's fate by relating them to that portentous sentence that concludes Chapter Thirty-six  --  " new growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place ; unforeseen accidents hinder intentions , and old plans are forgotten . " It was a triumph for me : by writing my first successful term paper about a book I 'd read , I also learned to read . Most mechanically , Owen helped my reading by another means : he determined that my eyes wandered to both the left and to the right of where I was in a sentence , and that  --  instead of following the elusive next word with my finger  --  I should highlight a spot on the page by reading through a hole cut in a piece of paper . It was a small rectangle , a window to read through ; I moved the window over the page  --  it was a window that opened no higher than two or three lines . I read more quickly and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day , I read through such a window . As for my spelling , Owen was more helpful than Dr. Dolder . It was Owen who encouraged me to learn how to type ; a typewriter does n't cure the problem , but I often can recognize that a typewritten word looks wrong  --  in longhand , I was ( and am ) a disaster . And Owen made me read the poems of Robert Frost aloud to him  --  " IN MY VOICE , THEY DO N'T SOUND SO GOOD . " And so I memorized " Nothing Gold Can Stay " and " Fire and Ice " and " Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening " ; Owen memorized " Birches , " but that one was too long for me . That summer of 1960 , when we swam in the abandoned quarry lake , we no longer tied a rope around ourselves or swam one-at-a-time  --  Mr. Meany had either lost interest in the rule , or in enforcing it ; or he had acknowledged that Owen and I were no longer children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam in the quarry , it did n't seem dangerous ; nothing seemed dangerous . That was the summer we registered for the draft , too ; it was no big deal . When we were sixteen , we got our driver 's licenses ; when we were eighteen , we registered for the draft . At the time , it seemed no more perilous than buying an ice-cream cone at Hampton Beach . On Sunday  --  when it was not a good beach day  --  Owen and I played basketball in the Gravesend Academy gym ; the summer-school kids had an outdoor sports program , and they were so stir-crazy on weekends that they went to the beach even when it rained . We had the basketball court to ourselves , and it was cool in the gym . There was an old janitor who worked the weekends and who knew us from the regular school-year ; he got us the best basketballs and clean towels out of ' the stock room , and sometimes hep291even let us swim in the indoor pool  --  I think he was a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he actually enjoyed watching Owen and me practice our idiotic stunt with the basketball  --  the leaping , lift-him-up , slam-dunk shot . " LET 'S PRACTICE THE SHOT , " Owen would say ; that was all we ever called it  --  " the shot . " We 'd go over it again and again . He would grasp the ball in both hands and leap into my arms ( but he never took his eyes from the rim of the basket ) ; sometimes he would twist in the air and slam the ball into the hoop backward  --  sometimes he would dunk it with one hand . I would turn in time to see the ball in the net and Owen Meany descending  --  his hands still higher than the rim of the basket but his head already below the net , his feet kicking the air . He always landed gracefully . Sometimes we could entice the old janitor to time us with the official scorer 's clock . " SET IT TO EIGHT SECONDS , " Owen would instruct him . Over the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . " SET IT TO FOUR , " Owen would say , and we 'd keep practicing ; under four seconds was tough . When I 'd get bored , Owen would quote me a little Robert Frost . " ONE COULD DO WORSE THAN BE A SWINGER OF BIRCHES . ' " In our wallets , in our pockets , the draft cards weighed nothing at all ; we never looked at them . It was n't until the fall term of 1960  --  with Headmaster White at the helm  --  that Gravesend Academy students found an interesting use for draft cards . Naturally , it was Owen Meany who made the discovery . He was in the office of The Grave , experimenting with a brand-new photocopier ; he found that he could copy his draft card  --  then he found a way to make a blank draft card , one without a name and without a date of birth . The drinking age in New Hampshire was twenty-one ; although Owen Meany did n't drink , he knew there were a lot of students at Gravesend Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was twenty-one . He charged twenty-one dollars a card . " THAT 'S THE MAGIC NUMBER , " he said . " JUST MAKE UP YOUR OWN BIRTHDAY . DO N'T TELL ANYONE WHERE YOU GOT THIS . IF YOU GET CAUGHT , I DO N'T KNOW YOU . " It was the first time he 'd broken the law  --  unless you count the business with the tadpoles and toads , and Mary Magdalene in her goal . " Toronto : May 14 , 1987  --  another sunny morning , but rain developing . President Reagan is now taking the tack that he 's proud of every efforthe 's made for the contras , whom he calls " the moral equivalent of ourfounding fathers . " The president confirmed that he had " discussed " the matter of aid with King Fand of Saudi Arabia ; he 's changed his story fromp292only two days ago . The Globe and Mail pointed out that " the king had brought up the subject " ; does it matter who brought it up ? " My diary shows I never brought it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was doing that . " I never thought the president could do anything that would make me feel at all close to him ; but Mr. Reagan keeps a diary , too ! Owen kept a diary . The first entry was as follows : " THIS DIARY WAS GIVEN TO ME FOR CHRISTMAS , 1960 , BY MY BENEFACTOR , MRS . HARRIET WHEELWRIGHT ; IT IS MY INTENTION TO MAKE MRS . WHEELWRIGHTPROUD OF ME . " I do n't believe that Dan Needham and I thought of my grandmother as Owen 's BENEFACTOR , although  --  quite literally  --  that is what she 'd become ; but that Christmas of 1960 , Dan and I  --  and Grandmother  --  had reason to be especially proud of Owen Meany . He 'd had a busy fall . Randy White , our new headmaster , had also been busy ; he 'd been making decisions , left and right , and The Voice had not allowed a single headmasterly move to pass unchallenged . The first decision had actually been Mrs. White 's ; she 'd not liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the headmaster 's house , it had already housed three headmasters ( two of them had died there ; old Thorny , when he retired , had moved to his former summer home in Rye , where he planned to live year ' round ) . But the traditional house was not up to the Lake Forest standards that the Whites were used to ; it was a well-kept , colonial house on Pine Street , but it was " too old " for the Whites  --  and " too dark , " she said , and " too far from the main campus , " he said ; and a " poor place to entertain , " they both agreed . Apparently , Sam White liked to " entertain . " " WHOM ARE THEY GOING TO ENTERTAIN ? " asked The Voice , who was critical of what he called " THE WHITES ' SOCIAL PRIORITIES . " Indeed , it was an expensive decision , too ; a new house was built for the headmaster  --  so central in its location that its ongoing construction was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been some problems with the architect  --  or else Mrs. White had changed her mind about a few of the interior particulars  --  after the constructionwas in progress ; hence the delay . It was a rather plain saltbox  --  " NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE OLDER FACULTY HOUSES , " as Owen pointed out ; also , its positioning interrupted a broad , beautiful expanse of lawn between the old library and the Main Academy Building . " There 's going to be a new library one day soon , anyway , " the headmaster said ; he was working up an expanded building proposal that included a new library , two new dormitories , a new dining hall , and --  " down the road "  --  a new gym with coeducational facilities . " Coedu/cation , " the headmaster said , " is a part of the future of any progressive school . " The Voice said : " IT IS IRONIC AND SELF-SERVING THAT THE SO-CALLED EXPANDED BUILDING PROPOSAL ' SHOULD BEGIN WITH A NEW HOUSE FOR THE HEADMASTER . IS HE GOING TO ENTERTAIN ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPITAL FUND DRIVE ' OFF THE GROUND ? IS THIS THE HOUSE THAT PAYS FOR EVERYTHING  --  FROM THE GYM ON DOWN ? " When the headmaster 's house was finally ready for occupancy , the Rev. Mr. Merrill and his family were moved out of a rather crowded dormitory apartment and into the former headmaster 's house on Pine Street . It was , impractically , at some distance from Hurd 's Church ; but the Rev. Lewis Men-ill , as a newcomer to the school , must have been grateful to have been given such a nice , old home . As soon as Randy White had done Mr. Merrill this favor , the headmaster made another decision . Morning chapel , which was daily , had always been held in Hurd 's Church ; it was not really a religious service , except for the ritual of singing an opening and closing hymn  --  and concluding the morning remarks or announcements with a prayer . The school minister did not usually officiate morning chapel ; the most frequent officiant was the headmaster himself . Sometimes a faculty member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the students delivered an impassioned plea for a new club . Occasionally , something exciting happened : I remember a fencing demonstration ; another time , one of the alumni  --  who was a famous magician  --  gave us a magic show , and one of the rabbits escaped in Hurd 's Church and was never found . What Mr. White decided was that Hurd 's Church was too gloomy a place for us to start our mornings ; he moved our daily assembly to the theater in the Main Academy Building  --  The Great Hall , it was called . Although the morning light was more evident there and the room had a high-ceilinged loftiness to it , it was , at the same time , austere  --  the towering portraits of former headmasters and faculty frowned grimly down upon us in their deep-black academic regalia . The faculty who chose to attend morning chapel ( they were not required to be there , as we were ) now sat on the elevated stage and looked down upon us , too . When the stage was set for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little room for the faculty on the narrow front of the stage . That was the first thing that Owen criticized about the decision : in Hurd 's Church , the faculty had sat in pews with the students  --  the faculty felt encouraged to attend . But in The Great Ilall , when one of Dan 's plays was set on the stage , there was room for so few chairs that faculty attendance was discouraged . In addition , Owen feltp294that " THE ELEVATION OF THE STAGE AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING LIGHT PROVIDE THE HEADMASTER WITH SUCH AN EXAGGERATED PLATFORM FROM WHICH TO SPEAK ; AND OFTEN , THERE 'S A KIND OF SPOTLIGHT , PROVIDED BY THE SUN , THAT GIVES US ALL THE FEELING THAT WE 'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF AN EXALTED PERSONAGE . I WONDER IF THIS IS THE INTENDED EFFECT , " wrote The Voice . I confess , I rather liked the change , which was popular with most students . The Great Hall was on the second floor of the Main Academy Building ; it could be approached from two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through two high and wide double doors . There was no lining up to enter or leave ; and many of us were already in the building for our first morning class . In the winter , especially , it was a tramp to Hurd 's Church , which was set off from all the classroom buildings . But Owen insisted that the headmaster was GRANDSTANDING  --  and that Randy White had skillfully manipulated the Rev. Mr. Merrill into a position where the minister would have felt ungrateful if he complained ; after all , he had a good house to live in . If taking morning chapel from Hurd 's Church was a move away from the Rev. Mr. Merrill 's territory  --  and if the minister resented the change  --  we did not hear a word of protest from the quiet Congregationalist about it ; only The Voice complained . But Randy White was just warming up ; his next decision was to abolish the Latin requirement  --  a requirement that everyone ( except the members of the Latin Department ) had moaned about for years . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a song that was often sung outside the Latin Department . There were six members in the Latin Department and three of them were within a year or two of retirement . White anticipated that enrollment in Latin would drop to half of what it was ( three years of the language had been a graduation requirement ) ; in a year or two , there would be the correctly reduced number of teachers in the department to teach Latin , and new faculty could be hired in the more popular Romance languages  --  French and Spanish . There were cheers in morning meeting when White announced the change  --  in quite a short time , we had begun to call " morning chapel " by another name ; White called it " morning meeting , " and the new name stuck . It was the way he had scrapped the Latin that was wrong , Owen pointed out . " IT IS SHREWD OF THE NEW HEADMASTER TO MAKE SUCH A POPULAR DECISION  --  AND WHAT COULD BE MORE POPULAR WITH STUDENTS THAN ABOLISHING A REQUIREMENT ? LATIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A VOTE  --  IN FACULTY MEETING . I 'M SURE THAT IF THEp295HEADMASTER HAD PROPOSED THE CHANGE , THE FACULTY WOULD HAVE ENDORSED IT . THE HEADMASTER HAS A CERTAINSINGULAR POWER : BUT WAS IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWER SO WHIMSICALLY ? HE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED THIS GOAL MORE DEMOCRATICALLY ; WAS IT NECESSARY TO SHOW THE FACULTY THAT HE DID N'T NEED THEIR APPROVAL ? AND WAS IT ACTUALLY LEGAL , UNDER OUR CHARTER OR OUR CONSTITUTION , FOR THE HEADMASTER TO CHANGE A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT ALL BY HIMSELF ? " That occasioned the first instance of the headmaster using the platform of morning meeting to answer The Voice . We were , after all , a captive audience . " Gentlemen , " Mr. White began . " I do not have the advantage of what amounts to a weekly editorial column in The Grave , but I should like to use my brief time  --  between hymns , and before our prayer  --  to enlighten you on the subject of our dear old school 's charter , and its constitution . In neither document is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen headmaster , who is designated as the principal , meaning the principal faculty member ; in neither the charter nor the constitution are the decision-making powers of the headmaster or principal inhibited in any way . Let Us Pray ... " Mr. White 's next decision was to replace our school attorney  --  a local lawyer  --  with an attorney-friend from Lake Forest , the former head of a law firm that had successfully fought off a food-poisoning suit against one of the big Chicago meat companies ; tainted meat had made a lot of people sick , but the Lake Forest attorney steered the blame away from the meat company , and the packager , and rested the fault upon a company of refrigeration trucks . On the advice of this attorney , Randy White changed the dismissal policy at Gravesend Academy . In the past , a so-called Executive Committee listened to the case of any boy who faced dismissal ; that committee made its recommendation to the faculty , and the whole faculty voted for the boy to stay or go . The Lake Forest attorney suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of a dismissal ; that the whole faculty was " acting as a jury without the in-depth understanding of the case that was afforded to the Executive Committee . " The attorney advised that the Executive Committee make the entire decision regarding the boy 's dismissal and the faculty not be involved . This was approved by Headmaster White , and the change was announced  --  in the manner of dropping the Latin requirement  --  in morning meeting . " FOR THE SAKE OF AVOIDING A HYPOTHETICAL LAWSUIT , " wrote Owen Meany , " THE HEADMAS'T'ER HAS CHANGED A DEMOCRACYTO AN OLIGARCHY  - -  HE HAS TAKEN THE FUTUREP296OF A BOY IN TROUBLE OUT OF THE HANDS OF MANY AND PLACED THE FATE OF THAT BOY INTO THE HANDS OF A FEW . AND LET US EXAMINE THESE FEW . THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEEIS COMPOSED OF THE HEADMASTER , THE DEAN OF STUDENTS , THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOLARSHIPS , AND FOUR MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY  --  ONLY TWO OF WHOM ARE ELECTED BY THE WHOLE FACULTY ; THE OTHER TWO ARE APPOINTED BY THE HEADMASTER . I SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS DORM ADVISER , HIS CURRENT TEACHERS AND COACHES . IN THE PAST , IN FACULTY MEETING , THESE WERE THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE UP IN A BOY 'S DEFENSE  --  OR THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW BEST THAT THE BOY DID NOT DESERVE DEFENDING . I SUGGEST THAT ANY BOY WHO IS DISMISSED BY THIS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SHOULD SUE THE SCHOOL . WHAT BETTER GROUNDS ARE THERE FOR A LAWSUIT IN THE CASE OF A DISMISSAL THAN THESE : THE PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO KNOW BEST THE VALUE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCHOOL ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO EVEN SPEAK IN YOUR DEFENSE  --  NOT TO MENTION , VOTE ? " I WARN YOU : ANYONE WHO GETS SENT UP BEFORE THIS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IS ALREADY A GONER ! THE HEADMASTERAND HIS TWO APPOINTEES VOTE AGAINST YOU ; THE TWO ELECTED FACULTY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VOTE FOR YOU . NOW YOU 'RE BEHIND , 3  --  2 . AND WHAT DO THE DEAN OF STUDENTS AND THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOLARSHIPS DO ? THEY DO N'T KNOW YOU FROM THE CLASSROOM , OR FROM THE GYM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIKE THE HEADMASTER . MAYBE THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOLARSHIPSLOOKS KINDLY ON YOU IF YOU 'RE A SCHOLARSHIP BOY ; THAT WAY , YOU LOSE 4  --  3 INSTEAD OF 5  --  2 . EITHER WAY , YOU LOSE . " LOOK UP OLIGARCHY ' IN THE DICTIONARY IF YOU DO N'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN : A FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE POWER IS VESTED IN A FEW PERSONS OR IN A DOMINANT CLASS OR CLIQUE ; GOVERNMENT BY THE FEW . ' " But there were other issues of " government " that captured everyone 's attention at the time ; even Owen was distracted from the decision-making capacities of the new headmaster . Everyone was talking about Kennedy or Nixon ; and it was Owen who initiated a mock election among the Gravesend Academy students  --  he organized it , he set up the balloting in the school post office , he seated himself behind a big table and checked off ' P297every student 's name . He caught a few kids voting twice , he sent " runners " to bother kids in the dorm who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his time between classes behind that big table ; he would n't let anyone else be the checker . The ballots themselves were secured in a locked box that was kept in the director of scholarships ' office  --  whenever it was out of Owen 's sight . There he sat at the table , with a campaign button as big as a baseball on the lapel of his sport jacket : All the Way with J F KHe wanted a Catholic ! " THERE 'S NO MONKEY BUSINESS ABOUT THIS ELECTION , " he told the voters . " IF YOU 'RE ENOUGH OF AN ASSHOLE TO VOTE FOR NIXON , YOUR DUMB VOTE WILL BE COUNTED  --  JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE ! " Kennedy won , in a landslide , but The Voice predicted that the real vote  --  in November  --  would be much closer ; yet Owen believed that Kennedy would , and should , triumph . " THIS IS AN ELECTION THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN FEEL A PART OF , " announced The Voice ; indeed , although Owen and I were too young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that youthful " vigor " that Kennedy represented . " WOULD N'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHOM PEOPLE UNDER THIRTY WO N'T LAUGH AT ? WHY VOTE FOR EISENHOWER 'S FIVE O'CLOCK SHADOW WHEN YOU CAN HAVE JACK KEN-NEDY ? " Once again , the headmaster saw fit to challenge the " editorial nature " of The Voice in morning meeting . " I 'm a Republican , " Randy White told us . " So that you do n't think that The Grave represents Republicans with even marginal objectivity , allow me to take a minute of your time  --  while , perhaps , the euphoria of John Kennedy 's landslide election here is still high but ( I hope ) subsiding . I 'm not surprised that so youthful a candidate has charmed many of you with his vigah , ' but  --  fortunately  --  the fate of the country is not decided by young men who are not old enough to vote . Mr. Nixon 's experience may not seem so glamorous to you ; but a presidential election is not a sailing race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm an Illinois Republican , " the headmaster said . " Illinois is the Land of Lincoln , as you boys know . " " ILLINOIS IS THE LAND OF AI ) LAI STEVENSON , " Owen Meany wrote . " AS FAR AS I KNOW , ADLAI STEVENSON IS A MORE RECENT RESIDENT OF ILLINOIS THAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN - ASP298FAR AS I KNOW , ADLAI STEVENSON IS A DEMOCRAT AND HE 'S STILL ALIVE . " And this little difference of opinion , as far as I know , was what prompted Randy White to make another decision . He replaced Mr. Early as the faculty adviser to The Grave ; Mr. White made himself the faculty adviser  --  and so The Voice was presented with a more adversarial censor than Owen had ever faced in Mr. Early . " You 'd better be careful , Owen , " Dan Needham advised . " You better watch your ass , man , " I told him . It was a very cold evening after Christmas when he pulled the tomato-red pickup into the parking lot behind St. Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playground , which had been flooded by an earlier , unseasonable rain that had now frozen to the black , reflecting sheen of a pond . " TOO BAD WE DO N'T HAVE OUR SKATES , " Owen said . At the far end of the smooth sheet of ice , the truck 's headlights caused the statue of Mary Magdalene to glow in her goal . " TOO BAD WE DO N'T HAVE OUR HOCKEY STICKS , AND A PUCK , " Owen said . A light went on  --  and then another light  --  in the saltbox where the nuns lived ; then the porch light was turned on , too , and two of the nuns came out on the porch and stared at our headlights . " EVER SEE PENGUINS ON ICE ? " Owen said . " Better not do anything , " I advised him , and he turned the truck around in the parking lot and drove to 80 Front Street . There was a " creature feature " on The Late Show ; Owen and I were now of the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never showed me what he wrote in his diary  --  not then . But after that Christmas he often carried it with him , and I knew it was important to him because he kept it by his bed , on his night table , right next to his copies of Robert Frost 's poems and under the guardianship of my mother 's dressmaker'sdummy . When he spent the night with me , at Dan 's or at 80 Front Street , he always wrote in the diary before he allowed me to turn out the light . The night I remember him writing most furiously was the night following President Kennedy 's inauguration ; that was in January of 1961 , and I kept begging him to turn the light out , but he went on , just writing and writing , and I finally fell asleep with the light on  --  I do n't know when he stopped . We 'd watched the inauguration on television at 80 Front Street ; Dan and my grandmother watched with us , and although my grandmother complained that Jack Kennedy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked " like a movie star " and that " he should wear a hat "  - -  Kennedy was theP299When our old friend Robert Frost tried to read his inaugural poem , Owen became most upset ; maybe it was the wind , maybe Frost 's eyes were tearing in the cold , or else it was the glare from the sun , or simply that the old man 's eyesight was failing -- whatever , he looked very feeble and he could n't read his poem properly . " The land was ours before we were the land 's , " Frost began . It was " The Gift Outright , " and Owen knew it by heart . " SOMEONE HELP HIM ! " Owen cried , when Frost began to struggle . Someone tried to help him  --  maybe it was the president himself , or Mrs. Kennedy ; I do n't remember . It was not much help , in any case , and Frost went on struggling with the poem . Owen tried to prompt him , but Robert Frost could not hear The Voice  --  not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the poem was better than Frost 's . SOMETHING WE WERE WITHHOLDING MADE US WEAK UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS OURSELVESWE WERE WITHHOLDING FROM OUR LAND OF LIVING , AND FORTHWITH FOUND SALVATION IN SURRENDER . It was the same voice that had prompted the Announcing Angel , who 'd forgotten his lines eight years ago ; it was the Christ Child speaking from the manger again . " JESUS , WHY CA N'T ANYONE HELP HIM ? " Owen cried . It was the president 's speech that really affected us ; it left Owen Meany speechless and had him writing in his diary into the small hours of the night . Some years later  --  after everything  --  I would get to read what he had written ; at the time , I knew only how excited he was  --  how he felt that Kennedy had changed everything for him . " NO MORE SARCASM MASTER , " he wrote in the diary . " NO MORE CYNICAL , NEGATIVE , SMART-ASS , ADOLESCENT BULLSHIT ! THERE IS A WAY TO BE OF SERVICE TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS A WAY TO BE OF USE WITHOUT BEING USED- WITHOUT BEING A SERVANT OF OLD MEN , AND THEIR 01.1 ) IDEAS . " There was more , much more . Hefirst Democrat that Harriet Wheelwright had ever voted for , and she liked him . Dan and Owen and I were crazy about him . It was a bright , cold , and windy day in Washington  --  and in Gravesend  --  and Owen was worried about the weather . " IT 'S TOO BAD IT COULD N'T BE A NICER DAY , " Owen said . " He should learn to wear a hat  --  it wo n't kill him , " my grandmother complained . " In this weather , he 'll catch his death . " P300thought that Kennedy was religious , and  --  incredibly  --  he did n't mind that Kennedy was a Catholic . " I BELIEVE HE 'S A KIND OF SAVIOR , " Owen wrote in his diary . " I DO N'T CARE IF HE 'S A MACKERELSNAPPER  --  HE'SGOT SOMETHING WE NEED . " In Scripture class , Owen asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Kennedy was " THE VERY THING ISAIAH HAD IN MIND  --  YOU KNOW , THE PEOPLE WHO WALKED IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT ; THOSE WHO DWELT IN A LAND OF DEEP DARKNESS , ON THEM HAS LIGHT SHINED . ' YOU REMEMBER THAT ? " " Well , Owen , " Mr. Merrill said cautiously , " I 'm sure Isaiah would have liked John Kennedy ; I do n't know , however , if Kennedy was the very thing Isaiah had in mind , ' as you say . " " FOR TO US A CHILD IS BORN , ' " Owen recited , " TO US A SON IS GIVEN ; AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE UPON HIS SHOULDER '  --  REMEMBER THAT ? " I remember ; and I remember how long it was after Kennedy 's inaugurationthat Owen Meany would still recite to me from Kennedy 's speech : " ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU  --  ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY . ' " Remember that ? P301Owen and I were nineteen-year-old seniors at Gravesend Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our class  --  when Owen told me , point-blank , what he had expressed to me , symbolically , when he was eleven and had mutilated my armadillo . " GOD HAS TAKEN YOUR MOTHER , " he said to me , when I was complaining about practicing the shot ; I thought he would never slam-dunk the ball in under four seconds , and I was bored with all our trying . " MY HANDS WERE THE INSTRUMENT , " he said . " GOD HAS TAKEN MY HANDS . I AM GOD 'S INSTRUMENT . " That he might have thought such a thing when he was eleven  --  when the astonishing results of that foul ball were such a shock to us both , and when whatever UNSPEAKABLE OUTRAGE his parents had suffered had plunged his religious upbringing into confusion and rebellion  --  I could understand him thinking anything then . But not when we were nineteen ! I was so surprised by the matter-of-fact way he simply announced his insane belief  --  " GOD HAS TAKEN MY IIANDS "  --  that when he jumped into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hounds . Owen did n't look much like GOD 'S INSI'KUMI ' . NI ' in his fallen position holding hisP302knee , which he 'd twisted in his fall , and writhing around on the gym floor under the basket . " If you 're God 's instrument , Owen , " I said , " how come you need my help to stuff a basketball ? " It was Christmas vacation , 1961 , and we were alone in the gym  --  except for our old friend ( and our only audience ) the retarded janitor , who operated the official scorer 's clock whenever Owen was in the mood to get serious about timing the shot . I wish I could remember his name ; he was often the only janitor on duty during school holidays and summer weekends , and there was a universal understanding that he was retarded or " brain damaged "  --  and Owen had heard that the janitor had suffered " shell shock " in the war . We did n't even know which war  --  we did n't know what " shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , rubbing his knee . " I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD THAT FAITH CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS , " he said . " THE TROUBLE WITH YOU IS , YOU DO N'T HAVE ANY FAITH . " " The trouble with you is , you 're crazy , " I told him ; but I retrieved the basketball . " It 's simply irresponsible , " I said  --  " for someone your age , and of your education , to go around thinking he 's God 's instrument ! " " I FORGOT I WAS TALKING TO MISTER RESPONSIBILITY , " he said . He 'd started calling me Mr. Responsibility in the fall of ' 61 , when we were engaged in that senior-year agony commonly called college-entrance applications and interviews ; because I 'd applied to only the state university , Owen said I 'd taken zero responsibility for my own self-improvement . Naturally , he 'd applied to Harvard and Yale ; as for the state university , the University of New Hampshire had offered him a so-called Honor Society Scholarship  --  and Owen had n't even applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special scholarship each year to someone they selected as the state 's best high-school or prep-school student . You had to be a bona fide resident of the state , and the prize scholarship was usually awarded to a public-school kid who was at the top of his or her graduating class ; but Owen was at the top of our Gravesend Academy graduating class , the first time a New Hampshire resident had achieved such distinction  --  " Competing Against the Nation 's Best , Gravesend Native Wins ! " was the headline in The Gravesend News-Letter : the story appeared in many of New Hampshire 's papers . The University of New Hampshire never imagined that Owen would accept the scholarship ; indeed , the Honor Society Scholarship was offered every year to New Hampshire 's " best "  --  with the tragic understanding that the recipient would probably go to Harvard or Yale , or to some other " better " school . It was obvious to me that OwenP303would be accepted  --  and offered full scholarships  --  at Harvard and Yale ; Hester was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire  --  and what would be the point of that ? Owen would begin his university career in the fall of ' 62 and Hester would graduate in the spring of ' 63 . " YOU MIGHT AT LEAST TRY TO GET INTO A BETTER UNIVERSITY , " Owen told me . I was not asking him to give up Harvard or Yale to keep me company at the University of New Hampshire . I thought it was unfair of him to expect me to go through the motions of applying to Harvard and Yale just to experience the rejections . Although Owen had substantially improved my abilities as a student , he could do little to improve my mediocre collegeboardscores ; I simply was n't Harvard or Yale material . I had become a good student in English and History courses ; I was a slow but thorough reader , and I could write a readable , well-organized paper ; but Owen was still holding my hand through the Math and Science courses , and I still plodded my dim way through foreign languages  --  as a student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet he was cross with me for accepting that I could do no better than the University of New Hampshire ; in truth , I liked the University of New Hampshire . Durham , the town , was no more threatening than Gravesend ; and it was near enough to Gravesend so that I could continue to see a lot of Dan and Grandmother  --  I could even continue to live with them . " I 'M SURE I 'LL END UP IN DURHAM , TOO , " Owen said  --  with just the smallest touch of self-pity in his voice ; but it infuriated me . " I DO N'T SEE HOW I CAN LET YOU FEND FOR YOURSELF , " he added . " I 'm perfectly capable of fending for myself , " I said . " And I 'll come visit you at Harvard or Yale . " " NO , WE 'LL BOTH MAKE OTHER FRIENDS , WE 'LL DRIFT APART  --  THAT 'S THE WAY IT HAPPENS , " he said philosophically . " AND YOU 'RE NO LETTER-WRITER  --  YOU DO N'T EVEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lower your standards and come to the University of New Hampshire for my sake , I 'll kill you , " I told him . " THERE ARE ALSO MY PARENTS TO CONSIDER , " he said . " IF I WERE IN SCHOOL AT DURHAM , I COULD STILL LIVE AT HOME ,  --  AND LOOK AFTER THEM . " " What do you need to look after them for ? " I asked him . It appeared to me that he spent as little time with his parents as possible ! " AND THERE 'S ALSO HESTER TO CONSIDER . " he added . " Let me get one thing straight , " I said to him " You and Hester-itP304seems to be the most on-again , off-again thing . Are you even sleeping with her  --  have you ever slept with her ? " " FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE , AND OF YOUR EDUCATION , YOU 'RE AWFULLY CRUDE , " Owen said . When he got up off the basketball court , he was limping . I passed him the basketball ; he passed it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers were brightly lit and huge. 00:04That 's what the clock said . I was so sick of it ! I held the ball ; he held out his hands . " READY ? " Owen said . On that word , the janitor started the clock . I passed Owen the ball ; he jumped into my hands ; I lifted him ; he reached higher and higher , and  --  pivoting in the air  --  stuffed the stupid basketball through the hoop . He was so precise , he never touched the rim . He was midair , returning to earth  --  his hands still above his head but empty , his eyes on the scorer 's clock at midcourt  --  when he shouted , " TIME ! " The janitor stopped the clock . That was when I would turn to look ; usually , our time had expired. 00:00But this time , when I looked , there was one second left on the clock . 00:01He had sunk the shot in under four seconds ! " YOU SEE WHAT A LITTLE FAITH CAN DO ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SET THE CLOCK TO THREE SECONDS ! " Owen told him . " Jesus Christ ! " I said . " IF WE CAN DO IT IN UNDER FOUR SECONDS , WE CAN DO IT IN UNDER THREE , " he said . " IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE MORE FAITH . " " It takes more practice , " I told him irritably . " FAITH TAKES PRACTICE , " said Owen Meany . Nineteen sixty-one was the first year of our friendship that was marred by unfriendly criticism and quarreling . Our most basic dispute began in the fall when we returned to the academy for our senior year , and one of the privileges extended to seniors at Gravesend was responsible for an argument that left Owen and me feeling especially uneasy . As seniors , we were permitted to take the train to Boston on either Wednesday or Saturday afternoon ; we had no classes on those afternoons ; and it ' we told the Dean'sP305Office where we were going , we were allowed to return to Gravesend on the Boston &; Maine  --  as late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , Owen and I did n't really have to be back to school until the Thursday morning meeting  --  or the Sunday service at Hurd 's Church , if we chose to go to Boston on a Saturday . Even on a Saturday , Dan and my grandmother frowned upon the idea of our spending most of the night in the " dreaded " city ; there was a so-called milk train that left Boston at two o'clock in the morning  --  it stopped at every town between Boston and Gravesend , and it did n't get us home until 6:30 A.M. ( about the time the school dining hall opened for breakfast )  --  but Dan and my grandmother said that Owen and I should live this " wildly " on only the most special occasions . Mr. and Mrs. Meany did n't make any rules for Owen , at all ; Owen was content to abide by the rules Dan and Grandmother made for me . But he was not content to spend his time in the dreaded city in the manner that most Gravesend seniors spent their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outing for a Gravesend senior began with a subway ride to Harvard Square ; there  --  with the use of a fake draft card , or with the assistance of an older Gravesend graduate ( now attending Harvard )  --  booze was purchased in abundance and consumed with abandon . Sometimes  --  albeit , rarely  --  girls were met . Fortified by the former ( and never in the company of the latter ) , our senior class then rode the subway back to Boston , where  --  once again , falsifying our age  --  we gained admission to the striptease performances that were much admired by our age group at an establishment known as Old Freddy 's . I saw nothing that was morally offensive in this rite of passage . At nineteen , I was a virgin . Caroline O'Day had not permitted the advance of even so much as my hand  --  at least not more than an inch or so above the hem of her pleated skirt or her matching burgundy knee socks . And although Owen had told me that it was only Caroline 's Catholicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN HER SAINT MICHAEL 'S UNIFORM ! "  --  I had been no more successful with Police Chief Ben Pike 's daughter , Lorna , who was not Catholic , and not wearing a uniform of any kind when I snagged my lip on her braces . Apparently , it was either my blood or my pain  --  or both  --  that disgusted her with me . At nineteen , to experience lust  --  even in its shabbiest forms at Old Freddy'swasat least to experience something ; and if Owen and I had at first imagined what love was at The Idaho , I saw nothing wrong in lusting at a hurlesque show . Owen , I imagined , was not a virgin ; how could he have remained a virgin with ! fester ' ? So I found it sheer hypocrisy for him to label Old Freddy 's DISGUSTING and DEGRADING . At nineteen , I drank infrequently-and entirely tom the maturing thrill ofP306becoming drunk . But Owen Meany did n't drink ; he disapproved of losing control . Furthermore , he had interpreted Kennedy 's inaugural charge  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literal fashion . He would falsify no more draft cards ; he would produce no more fake identification to assist the illegal drinking and burlesque-show attendanceof his peers  --  and he was loudly self-righteous about his decision , too . Fake draft cards were WRONG , he had decided . Therefore , we walked soberly around Harvard Square  --  a part of Cambridge that is not necessarily enhanced by sobriety . Soberly , we looked up our former Gravesend schoolmates  --  and , soberly , I imagined the Harvard community ( and how it might be morally altered ) with Owen Meany in residence . One of our former schoolmates even told us that Harvard was a depressing experience  --  when sober . But Owen insisted that our journeys to the dreaded city be conducted as joyless research ; and so they were . To maintain sobriety and to attend the striptease performances at Old Freddy 's was a form of unusual torture ; the women at Old Freddy 's were only watchable to the blind drunk . Since Owen had made fake draft cards for himself and me before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we used the cards to be admitted to Old Freddy 's . " THIS IS DISGUSTING ! " Owen said . We watched a heavy-breasted woman in her forties remove her pasties with her teeth ; she then spat them into the eager audience . " THIS IS DEGRADING ! " Owen said . We watched another unfortunate pick up a tangerine from the dirty floor of the stage ; she lifted the tangerine almost to knee level by picking it up from the floor with the labia of her vulva  --  but she could raise it no higher . She lost her grip on the tangerine , and it rolled off the stage and into the crowd  --  where two or three of our schoolmates fought over it . Of course it was DISGUSTING and DEGRADING  --  we were sober ! " LET 'S FIND A NICE PART OF TOWN , " Owen said . " And do what ? " I asked him . " LOOK AT IT , " Owen said . It occurs to me now that most of the seniors at Gravesend Academy had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite apart from stronger motives , Owen Meany was interested in what that was like . That was how we ended up on Newbury Street  --  one Wednesday afternoon in the fall of ' 61 . I know now that it was NO ACCIDENT that we ended up there . There were some art galleries on Newbury Street  --  and some very posh stores selling pricey antiques , and some very fancy clothing stores . ThereP307was a movie theater around the corner , on Exeter Street , where they were showing a foreign film  --  not the kind of thing that was regularly shown in the vicinity of Old Freddy 's ; at The Exeter , they were showing movies you had to read , the kind with subtitles . " Jesus ! " I said . " What are we going to do here ? " " YOU 'RE SO UNOBSERVANT , " Owen said . He was looking at a mannequin in a storefront window  --  a disturbingly faceless mannequin , severely modern for the period in that she was bald . The mannequin wore a hip-length , silky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut along the sexy lines of a camisole . The mannequin wore nothing else ; Owen stared at her . " This is really great , " I said to him . " We come two hours on the train  --  we 're going to ride two more hours to get back  --  and here you are , staring at another dressmaker 's dummy ! If that 's all you want to do , you do n't even have to leave your own bedroom ! " " NOTICE ANYTHING FAMILIAR ? " he asked me . The name of the store , " Jerrold 's , " was painted in vivid-red letters across the window  --  in a flourishing , handwritten style . Jerrold 's " Jerrold 's , " I said . " So what 's familiar ' ? " He put his little hand in his pocket and brought out the label he had removed From my mother 's old red dress ; it was the dummy 's red dress , really , because my mother had hated it . It was FAMILIAR  --  what the label said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same vivid shade of lire-engine poinsettia red . She said the store burned down , did n't she ? " I asked Owen . " SHE ALSO SAID SHE COULD N'T REMEMBER THE STORE 'S NAME . THAT SHE HAD TO ASK PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOR-P308HOOD , " Owen said . " BUT THE NAME WAS ON THE LABEL  --  IT WAS ALWAYS ON THE BACK OF THE DRESS . " With a shudder , I thought again about my Aunt Martha 's assertion that my mother was a little simple ; no one had ever said she was a liar . " She said there was a lawyer who told her she could keep the dress , " I said . " She said that everything burned , did n't she ? " " BILLS OF SALE WERE BURNED , INVENTORY WAS BURNED , STOCK WAS BURNED  --  THAT 'S WHAT SHE SAID , " Owen said . " The telephone melted  --  remember that part ? " I asked him . " THE CASH REGISTER MELTED  --  REMEMBER THAT ? " he askedme . " Maybe they rebuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe there was another store  --  maybe there 's a chain of stores . " He did n't say anything ; we both knew it was unlikely that the public 's interest in the color red would support a chain of stores like Jerrold 's . " How 'd you know the store was here ? " I asked Owen . " I SAW AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE SUNDAY BOSTON HERALD , " he said . " I WAS LOOKING FOR THE FUNNIES AND I RECOGNIZED THE HANDWRITING  --  IT WAS THE SAME STYLE AS THE LABEL . " Leave it to Owen to recognize the handwriting ; he had probably studied the label in my mother 's red dress for so many years that he could have written " Jerrold 's " in the exact same style himself ! " WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR ? " Owen asked me . " WHY DO N'T WE GO INSIDE AND ASK THEM IF THEY EVER HAD A FIRE ? " Inside the place , we were confronted by a spareness as eccentric as the glaring color of every article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have a theme , it appeared to be  --  stated , and overstated  --  that there was only one of everything : one bra , one nightgown , one half-slip , one little cocktail dress , one long evening dress , one long skirt , one short skirt , the one blouse on the one mannequin we had seen in the window , and one counter of four-sided glass that contained a single pair of red leather gloves , a pair of red high heels , a garnet necklace ( with a matching pair of earrings ) , and one very thin belt ( also red , and probably alligator or lizard ) . The walls were white , the hoods of the indirect lights were black , and the one man behind the one counter was about the age my mother would have been if she 'd been alive . The man regarded Owen and me disdainfully : he saw two teenage boys , not dressed for Newbury Street , possibly ( if so , pathetically ) shopping for a mother or for a girlfriend ; I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color red available in Jerrold 's . " DID YOU EVER HAVE A FIRE ' ? " Owen asked the man . P309Giordano , but they fucked around with his name when he got off the boat . " This was an immigration story , and not the story Owen and I were interested in , so I asked the man , politely : " Is your father alive ? " " Hey , Poppa ! " the man shouted . " You alive ? " A white door , fitted so flush to the white wall that Owen and I had not noticed it was there , opened . An old man with a tailor 's measuring tape around his neck , and a tailor 's many pins adorning the lapels of his vest , came into the storeroom . " Of course I 'm alive ! " he said . " You waitin ' for some miracle ? You in a hurry for your inheritance ? " He had a mostly-Boston , somewhat-Italian accent . " Poppa , these young men want to talk to Jerrold ' about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laconically and with a more virulent Boston accent than his father 's . " What fire ? " Mr. Giordano asked us . " We were told that your store burned down  --  sometime in the forties , or the fifties , " I said . " This is big news to me ! " said Mr. Giordano . " My mother must have made a mistake , " I explained . I showed the old label to Mr. Giordano . " She bought a dress in your store  --  sometime in the forties , or the fifties . " I did n't know what else to say . " It was a red dress , " I added . " No kiddin ' , " said the son . I said : " I wish I had a picture of her  --  perhaps I could come hack , with a photograph . You might rememher something about her if I showed you a picture , " I said . Now the man looked less sure about us ; he thought we were too young to be selling insurance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had disarmed him . " It would have been a fire in the forties , " I said . " OR THE EARLY FIFTIES , " said Owen Meany . " Perhaps you have n't been here  --  at this location  --  for that long ? " I asked the man . " ARE YOU JERROLD ? " Owen asked the man ; like a miniature policeman , Owen Meany pushed the wrinkled label from my mother 's dress across the glass-topped counter . " That 's our label , " the man said , fingering the evidence cautiously . " We 've been here since before the war  --  but I do n't think we 've ever had a fire . What sorta fire do you mean ? " he asked Owen  --  because , naturally , Owen appeared to be in charge . " ARE YOU JERROLD ? " Owen repeated . " That 's my father  --  Giordano , " the man said . " He was Giovanni " Does she want the dress altered ? " the old man asked me . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into the store herself . I do n't do alterations from pictures ! " " SHE 'S DEAD , " said Owen Meany . His tiny hand went into his pocket again . He brought out a neatly folded envelope ; in the envelope was the picture my mother had given him  --  it was a wedding picture , very pretty of her and not bad of Dan . My mother had included the photo with a thank-you note to Owen and his father for their unusual wedding present . " I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE BROUGHT A PICTURE , " Owen said , handing the sacred object to Mr. Giordano . " Frank Sinatra ! " the old man cried ; his son took the picture from him . " That do n't look like Frank Sinatra to me , " the son said . " No ! No ! " the old man cried ; he grabbed the photo back . " She loved those Sinatra songs  --  she sang ' em real good , too . We used to talk about Frankie Boy '  --  your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty voice , " Mr. Giordano said . " DO YOU KNOW WHY SHE BOUGHT THE DRESS ? " Owen asked . " Sure , I know ! " the old man told us . " It was the dress she always sung in ! I need somethin ' to sing in ! '  --  that 's what she said when she walked in here . I need somethin ' not like me ! '  --  that 's what she said . I 'll never forget her . But I did n't know who she was  --  not when she come in here , not then ! " Mr. Giordano said . " Who the fuck was she ? " the son asked . I shuddered to hear him ask ; it had just occurred to me that I did n't know who my mother was , either . " She was The Lady in Red '  --  do n't you remember her ? " Mr. Giordano asked his son . " She was still singin ' in that place when you got home from the war . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's her ! " he cried . " The Lady in Red ' ! " the Giordanos cried together . I was trembling . My mother was a singer  --  in some joint ! She was someone called " The Lady in Red " ! She 'd had a career  --  in nightlife ! I looked at Owen ; he appeared strangely at ease -- he was almost calm , and he was smiling . " IS N'T THIS MORE INTERESTING THAN OLD FREDDY 'S ? " Owen asked me . What the Giordanos told us was that my mother had been a female vocalist at a supper club on Beacon Street  --  " a perfectly proper sorta place ! " the old man assured us . There was a black pianist  --  he played an old-fashioned piano , which ( the Giordanos explained ) meant that he played the old tunes , and quietly , " so 's you could hear the singer ! " It was not a place where single men or women went ; it was not a bar ; it was a supper club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aP311restaurant with live entertainment  --  " somethin ' relaxed enough to digest to ! " About ten o'clock , the singer and pianist served up music more suitable for dancing than for dinner-table conversation  --  and there was dancing , then , until midnight ; men with their wives , or at least with " serious " dates . It was " no place to take a floozy  --  or to find one . " And most nights there was " a sorta famous female vocalist , someone you woulda heard of " ; although Owen Meany and I had never heard of anyone the Giordanos mentioned . " The Lady in Red " sang only one night a week ; the Giordanos had forgotten which night , but Owen and I could provide that information . It would have been Wednesday  --  always Wednesday . Supposedly , the singing teacher my mother was studying with was so famous that he had time for her only on Thursday mornings  --  and so early that she had to spend the previous night in the " dreaded " city . Why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always " The Lady in Red "  --  the Giordanos did n't know . Nor could they recall the name of the supper club ; they just knew it was n't there anymore . It had always had the look of a private home ; now it had , in fact , become one  --  " somewheres on Beacon Street , " that was all they could remember . It was either a private home or doctors ' offices . As for the owner of the club , he was a Jewish fellow from Miami . The Giordanos had heard that the man had gone back to Miami . " I guess they still have supper clubs down there , " old Mr. Giordano said . He was sad and shocked to hear that my mother was dead ; " The Lady in Red " had become quite popular among the local patrons of the club  --  " not famous , not like some of them others , but a kinda regular feature of the place . " The Giordanos remembered that she had come , and that she had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . Later , she had gone away for good ; but people did n't believe it and they would say , for years , that she was coming back again . When she 'd been away  --  " for a while "  --  that was when she 'd been having me , of course . The Giordanos could almost remember the name of the black pianist ; " he was there as long as the place was there , " they said . But the closest they could come to the man 's name was " Buster . " " Big Black Buster ! " Mr. Giordano said . " I do n't think he was from Miami , " the son said . " CLEARLY , " said Owen Meany , when we were once more out on Newbury Street , " BIG BLACK BUSTER ' IS NOT YOUR FATHER ! " I wanted to ask Owen if he still had the name and address  --  and even the phone number  --  of my mother 's singing and voice teacher ; I knew Mother had given the particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded anything she gave hint . But I did n't have to ask . Once more , his tiny hand shot into his pocket.
