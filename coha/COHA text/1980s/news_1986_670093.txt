FRANCONIA NOTCH , N.H.  --  Republican Gov . John Sununu , traveling through an autumn snow squall in this White Mountain pass , is arguing that the issue in his battle for a third term is clear . " Paul McEachern is one of the great broad-based taxers in the state , " the governor says of his Democratic opponent . " That is the top issue . " Mr. McEachern , campaigning amid the ripply reflection of orange , crimson and scarlet in the cold blue waters of the Sugar River , sees the campaign differently . " The only issue , " he says , " is whether we ' re going to go down that nuclear road . " Here in faraway hills , pine glens and remote hamlets of New Hampshire , where the television signals are weak and the Yankee accents are strong , the campaign for governor is taking on a decidedly modern tint . In the wake of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl , the Democrat is basing his challenge on a final assault on the nuclear power plant at Seabrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate cuts , the Republican incumbent is charging that his opponent is a secret believer in a state income tax . Mr. Sununu still holds a commanding lead here in his effort to become only the third New Hampshire governor to win three terms , and he ' s got some strong pluses going for him . The state ' s economy is robust and New Hampshire has had the lowest unemployment rate in the nation for the past four years . Nevertheless , political analysts believe that the nuclear issue is an extremely volatile one , especially while memories of the Chernobyl accident are fresh and as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is examining a proposal to load fuel into the Seabrook reactor and to conduct preliminary tests of the $4. 5 billion plant on the state ' s seacoast . " This has been one of the biggest issues in this state for almost a decade , " says David Moore , a University of New Hampshire political scientist . " But only now is the operation of the plant an issue for the public at large . " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manchester late last month shows that the public opposes the operation of the plant by a margin of better than 2 to 1 , with two voters out of three saying the governor has done a " fair " or " poor " job on the nuclear issue . Electoral surprises aren ' t uncommon in New Hampshire , one of only three states that still clings to the old two-year gubernatorial term . In 1978 , in fact , controversy over the costs of the Seabrook plant catapulted Democrat Hugh Gallen into the governor ' s chair in Concord over three-term GOP Gov . Meldrim Thomson , a devout anti-taxer . Now Gov . Sununu " is not as safe as he thought he was , " says Walter Dunfey , the Omni/Dunfey Hotel executive who is active in state Democratic circles . Mr. McEachern talks of little else but the Seabrook issue as he moves across the state . In the course of a campaign day he tells students at Sunapee High School of the dangers of nuclear waste , warns an audience at a senior center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reassures the white-haired lady behind the bubble gum and key rings at the Woolworth ' s in Claremont that taxpayers like her won ' t be forced to bear the financial burden if the plant never opens . All of the television advertising he plans for the final weeks of the campaign will stress the Seabrook issue . " My campaign is based on Seabrook  --  period , " he says as he samples the blue-plate special at the Newport Pretty Good Diner . " When it comes down to it , I have a few weeks left and this is my best shot . " The McEachern campaign ' s emphasis on Seabrook has attracted some Republican support . " I ' m not only voting for the Democrat , I ' m actively working for him , " says Republican State Rep. Roberta Pevear of Hampton Falls , who lives a mile and a half from the plant . " I ' m at war for my home , for my constituents and for my children . " Mr. McEachern , who was legal counselor to Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Seabrook plant . He pledges he would " fight the NRC until the cows come home " and would withdraw the emergency-response plan  --  required for federal licensing  --  that the state has submitted to the commission . Gov . Sununu , who says that the Democrats " are betting their party on Seabrook , " argues that Mr. McEachern couldn ' t stop the plant even if he were elected . He adds , moreover , that his rival is practicing " the politics of fear , the politics of negativism " and in recent weeks has tried to dismiss many of the residents ' fears . " Nancy and I have eight kids , " the governor tells Olivia Garfield , managing editor of the Littleton Courier , which is delivered to 6 , 500 homes in the northwest reaches of the state . " We live right down the road ( from the plant ) . I ' d never allow anything that would jeopardize the things I hold most precious . " But , to Gov . Sununu , Seabrook is an economic issue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he tells a small gathering of supporters at a $4. 95-a-plate lunch . " We have to go on emergency buys a few days a year and it ' s going to get worse . There ' s no way we can keep our economic vitality without it . " Economic vitality is at the heart of Mr. Sununu ' s campaign . Only three other states have produced a higher rate of new jobs , and the growth in per-capita income , 31% during the Sununu years , represents the fastest rate in the nation . The result is an economic recovery that took root in the southern part of the state but has reached even the most stubbornly depressed areas of the north country . Even though New Hampshire is the fastest-growing northern state , with roughly 20 , 000 new people a year , the state suffers from spot labor shortages . Today there are researchers and robots  --  and even a heliport  --  among the old mills along the Merrimack . A former mechanical-engineering professor who still lists his home number in the telephone book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased aid to education , a new state prison and a new central psychiatric center . And all of this was accomplished without changing New Hampshire ' s cherished position as the only state without a general sales or income tax . ( Most of the state ' s revenue comes from a business-profits tax , levies on hotel rooms and restaurant meals , taxes on out-of-state interest and dividends , and receipts from liquor and lottery-ticket sales . ) The governor ' s style is equal parts managerial and political , and his mastery of the state budget makes him a formidable adversary . " He ' s given off a very , very positive public signal about competency and having hands-on control of the state government , " says Richard Winters , a specialist in state government at Dartmouth College . " He ' s done all the business of the state within the existing tax system . " In campaign appearances and interviews , Mr. Sununu is framing the tax issue in a way consistent with the state ' s heritage and its heralded frugality . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining low taxes , " the governor says . During his unsuccessful battle for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1984 , Mr. McEachern suggested a 3% income tax , with the revenue to be devoted to local programs . And though Mr. McEachern says he " learned the hard way " that no candidate for governor can support a broad-based tax , Gov . Sununu says his opponent is " still a true believer " in an income tax . " He knows he can ' t get elected saying it , but if he had his choice the state would have an income tax , " Mr. Sununu asserts .
