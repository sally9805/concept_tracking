Under the auspices of the Federal Aviation Administration , Piedmont Airlines plans to begin daily operation of such a system on a Boeing 727 jet in December. // The action comes almost a quarter century later than airline officials once planned . It constitutes a limited step toward the goal of making such safeguards standard airline equipment. // But at a time when concern over the collision hazard have been exacerbated by a fatal collision in August involving a small airliner , and by a rash of recent close calls , many safety experts view the Piedmont plan as an event of considerable potential significance. // Their worries were heightened again recently when Vice President Bush ' s Boeing 707 , approaching a landing at Seattle ' s Boeing Field , abruptly descended about 200 feet to avoid hitting a small plane crossing from the left . <> <> Increase in Traffic Cited // These safety experts note that soaring air traffic this year produced record congestion and delays , and they suggest that these trends largely account for the spurt in midair incidents . They hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce skepticism developed over many years of tests and hasten the time when the airlines and other users might install anticollision systems. // Dr. Clyde Miller , the F.A.A. official directing the program , says : " This is the first step across the line from research and development to practical use . " But he cautions that the operational effectiveness of the anticollision equipment , day in and day out , " has yet to be demonstrated. " // The system does not rely on any equipment on the ground . A device installed in an airplane keeps track of other nearby planes that are equipped with radar-triggered beacons . These beacons are installed on all airliners and most modern private craft . The anticollision device alerts the crew using it to the location of the other planes . If a collision threatens , the device signals the crew whether to dive , climb or remain level to avoid a crash. <> <> // Currently , radar controllers on the ground and pilots looking out cockpit windows keep planes from colliding with one another . They would still be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the anticollision devices would give additional protection. // Piedmont is slated to operate one anticollision device for eight months . Afterward , in early 1986 , Piedmont , Republic and United Airlines are to install the devices on a total of seven planes . Optimists say that the devices could be in general use on many airliners by the end of 1988 . The skeptics think it will be 1990 before that can happen. // And still other experts doubt that the airborne devices will find their way into general use in the near future . They see too many technical problems to be surmounted . They believe that a system providing instructions only for vertical maneuvers , advising pilots to climb , dive , or remain level , can not fill safety criteria , and that the general use of airborne anticollision devices will not come until systems are perfected that also provide turning instructions. // Cost is also a factor . The devices are expected to sell for at least $50 , 000 each . Some airlines may decide that , with improvments in the air traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth the costs of backup airborne devices. // " I fear that we ' re going to end up doing it in the aftermath of a serious incident , " one airline official said. <> <> // It has been six years since the last United States collision involving a major airliner . In that incident , a Pacific Southwest Airlines 727 collided with a small private plane at the edge of San Diego International Airport , killing all 137 people on both planes and seven people on the ground. // More than two decades ago , Piedmont announced it planned to buy an airborne anticollision system being developed by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation . But even though military versions were successfully used in routine test flights of Navy Phantom fighters coming off the company ' s production line , the commercial products were never brought to the point of certification by the Government. // Other development efforts were pursued until , in June 1981 , the then chief of the Federal Aviation Administration , J. Lynn Helms , said his agency had developed an anticollision system to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " in being " by the end of 1984. // He gave the impression that the devices would be ready for purchase and installation on a group of aircraft in daily operation by that date . Today the most that could happen is the installation of the limited system on the single Piedmont plane. // That device was manufactured by the Dalmo Victor division of Bell Aerospace/Textron . It sends radar signals in all directions and collects and analyzes the signals . Planes within range that are equipped with special beacons will send back enhanced signals . The most valuable return signals will be those from planes carrying beacons equipped to report altitude . All airliners have beacons with such capabilities. // A computer keeps track of all nearby aircraft equipped with beacons . When it calculates that another plane is within 40 seconds away , the device will show the relative position of the other plane on the weather radar display. // When the distance between the planes becomes 20 to 25 seconds , the system sounds a siren and , in a spoken message and through a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical maneuver that will avoid a collision . It is up to the crew to make the final decision . <> <> Turn Indications Requested // The Air Line Pilots Association has been especially insistent that the devices must ultimately be able to recommend a horizontal right turn or left turn maneuver in addition to a vertical maneuver. // A competing Government-backed system built by the Bendix Corporation is expected to have that capability . Underlying this approach is the concern of some experts that the altimeters used on many private planes are subject to errors so large as to cast doubt on the safety of using only vertical escape maneuvers. // // Estimates on the cost of a single installation range from a low of $50 , 000 to as much as $125 , 000. // //
