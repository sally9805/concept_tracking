 |p634  IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER of Switzerland , deep beneath tidy farms and villages , lies a maze of tunnels where it can be hotter than at the heart of the sun . The source of this awesome heat lies within a thin steel pipe encased in magnets ? a particle accelerator . Operated near Geneva by CERN ( the European Laboratory for Particle Physics ) , the accelerator is more than four miles long and one of the largest machines ever built . It produces temperatures as high as 7,000 trillion degrees Celsius , comparable to conditions an instant after the superhot explosion that created the universe itself . Using the CERN accelerator like an immense microscope , physicists are probing the structure of the atom , an inner cosmos of subatomic particles as remote from our daily experience as the farthest reaches of space . Yet that structure may hold an explanation of how the universe was born . During the past 50 years scientists exploring the atom 's interior have solved many age-old mysteries of matter and energy . This new knowledge has brought us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear energy for weapons and power . " But what we 're really after is a new concept of reality , " says Leon Lederman , director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois . " We 're after something akin to the revolution in thinking that followed Copernicus 's announcement that the earth circles the sun . " Lederman and other physicists are searching for the ultimate building blocks from which all things ? the stars , the earth , you , I , and the atom ? are made . Because everything in the cosmos has been composed of these particles since the primordial big bang , scientists also hope to learn the origin of the universe ,  |p640  a goal that eluded even Albert Einstein . Today his successors , at CERN and elsewhere around the world , think they are getting close . CERN 's doughnut-shaped particle accelerator lies 15 stories belowground , in a gracefully curving concrete cavern that twice bores through the rock of the FrancoSwiss border . It takes more than an hour to walk the four-mile circuit of CERN 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make 43,000 times each second without benefit of passport . During a brief shutdown for repairs , British physicist Vince Hatton led me to the accelerator 's beam line , a waist-high steel tube outfitted with alternating red and blue magnets . The air smelled of oil and machinery . The beam line looked like a snake winding through a high-tech hole on another planet . The magnets guide a stream of protons around the beam line at nearly the speed of light ( 186,282 miles per second ) before they collide with a beam of antiprotons whirling in the opposite direction . The impacts are so violent ? like volleys of cannonballs smashing into each other ? that energy is transformed into matter , creating subatomic particles that fly wildly in all directions . Most of these particles are short-lived ? some last only a trillionth of a trillionth of a second before vanishing ? and are rare in the universe . But as debris from a collision inside CERN 's accelerator , they occur in sufficient numbers for physicists to study them to learn what makes up atomic matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation , and steel doors operated by electronic keys keep out humans . " The system is foolproof , " said Hatton , as warning horns sounded . The machine was about to be switched on . But the vault-like exit door was locked shut . My apprehension grew until Hatton picked up a telephone . " It ca n't be turned on while we 're in here , " he said , as someone half a mile away pushed a button and the door opened . Minutes later the beams were again circling the accelerator ring . In a control room , colorful computer screens blinked with graphs that charted subatomic collisions at two points along the ring . Computer operators adjusted the flow of electricity to the ring 's magnets , steering the beams to increase the collision rate . Experimenters fretted at computer terminals , brandished printouts , and haggled over operating procedures with Hatton , who oversees the accelerator . Each of the world 's ten big accelerator @#  |p641  centers ? in the U. S. , Europe , Japan , and the Soviet Union ? wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samios , director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York , puts it : " Nobody remembers the second person to say E=mc2 . ' " The large European accelerators , CERN and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron ( DESY ) in Hamburg , West Germany , are generally better funded than their United States competitors . Survival ? fundingdepends upon scientific breakthroughs . So too does continued exploration of one of man 's last great frontiers , the inner world of the atom . It is a world where matter and energy are interchangeable , where empty space is not really empty , and where gravity is overwhelmed by far stronger forces that bind together matter . MAN HAS SPECULATED endlessly about the nature of matter . Some 2,300 years ago the Greek philosophers Democritus and Leucippus proposed that if you cut an object , such as a loaf of bread , in half , and then in half again and again until you could do it no longer , you would reach the ultimate building block . They called it an atom . The atom is infinitesimal . Your every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the everyday world we inhabit are virtually indestructible , the air you suck into your lungs may include an atom or two gasped out by Democritus with his dying breath . To grasp the scale of the atom and the world within , look at a letter " i " on this page . Magnify its dot a million times with an electron microscope , and you would see an array of a million ink molecules . This is the domain of the chemist . Look closely at one ink molecule and you would see a fuzzy image of the largest atoms that compose it . Whether by eye , camera , or microscope , no one has ever seen the internal structure of an atom : Minute as atoms are , they consist of still tinier subatomic particles . Protons , carrying a positive electric charge , and electrically neutral particles called neutrons cluster within the atom 's central region , or nucleus ? one hundred-thousandth the diameter of the atom . Nuclear physicists work at this level of matter . Whirling around the nucleus is a third subatomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Electric current consists of flowing electrons , point-like particles literally impossible to measure . Electrons " orbit " an atom 's nucleus according to principles governing the motion of waves . Unlike planets revolving around the sun , electrons do not follow fixed paths . Yet the probable location of electrons can be calculated using quantum mechanics , a mathematical system developed in the 1920s to describe the weird behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level , the world of particle physicists . That particles can act like waves may seem bizarre . But no more so than some other oddities suggested by quantum theory : That how we probe matter affects its behavior and form ; that some particles exist so briefly that they are not real but " virtual " ; and that well-ordered reality ? the whole of the universe ? rests on chance and randomness at the subatomic level . Besides quantum mechanics , the other concept crucial to our modern view of the atom and its parts is Einstein 's special theory of relativity . His formula , E=mc2 , where E is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvarying speed of light , states that mass and energy are merely different versions of the same thing . Einstein , however , never accepted quantum mechanics . He felt that randomness could not be the ultimate reality , and he debated the point with another titan of atomic theory , Danish physicist Niels Bohr . On this point Einstein has been proved wrong , yet his special relativity theory is routinely put to work in accelerators , where energy is transformed into subatomic particles in a hint of how the universe may have come to be . PARADOXICALLY , exploring the smallest things in the universe requires the largest machines on earth . As physicists have penetrated from the molecule to the atom and then to the atom 's nucleus with its protons and neutrons , they have pulled back layer after layer of matter as if @#  |p653  peeling an artichoke . To reveal each layer requires increasing amounts of energy provided by massive atom smashers . No two of these giants are alike , but there are two basic types . Some , like Stanford 's linear accelerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at atomic nuclei . Two miles long and as straight as the laser beam used to align it , the accelerator hurls electrons at 99.99 percent the speed of light . But like the one at CERN , most accelerators are circular and use protons as projectiles . Protons are heavier and generate more collisions . However , collisions in an electron accelerator are easier to analyze . Almost every American home has a primitive accelerator : the television picture tube . Inside it electricity heats a metal filament , boiling off negatively charged electrons and accelerating them through a positively charged wire grid . A magnet then steers them at the phosphorus-coated TV screen , which glows from the collisions . In most high-energy physics labs the first step in accelerating subatomic particles depends upon an accelerator , invented in 1932 by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton . It extracts protons or electrons from atoms of hydrogen gas . In 1978 an elderly Ernest Walton visited Fermilab and inspected such an accelerator . Covered with metallic balls for discharging electrical energy , the monstrous contraption seemed fit for a horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge bolt of lightning . " Ah , " said the delighted Walton , " the machine knows its master . " The particles liberated by a CockcroftWalton accelerator are boosted to greater and greater velocity in copper chambers called radio-frequency cavities . Electric pulses fed to the cavities millions of times each second lift the particles to high energy and sweep them down an accelerator 's beam line on traveling radio waves , like surfers riding a crest . In ring-shaped machines such as the CERN accelerator , electromagnets focus the particles into a pencil-thin beam and steer it in a circle . To prevent unwanted collisions with stray atoms , oxygen and other gases are pumped from the beam line tube , leaving it nearly as airless as the moon . @# Particle physicists measure an accelerator 's power in electron volts ; the more electron volts that an accelerator produces , the deeper it can delve into the atom . One electron volt ( eV ) is about the energy gained by a single electron flowing from the negative to the positive end of a flashlight battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it takes millions of electron volts ? MeV ? to probe the nucleus . Energy a thousand times higher still , in the billion eV ( or GeV , for giga-electron volt ) range , is needed to propel particles with enough force to shatter protons and electrons and thus create new matter . One way to boost energy is to fire two beams of particles in opposite directions around a ring , so that they slam together . This doubles the energy , giving the CERN accelerator , for instance , an energy of 630 GeV . Yet the attractive force binding together the constituents of protons and neutrons is so immense ? trillions of trillions of times stronger than earth 's gravity ? that even the CERN machine can only pick and poke at the atom 's inner structure . " It 's a bit like finding out how cars work by smashing them together and seeing what falls out , " Dr. Carlo Rubbia told me at CERN , where he was on leave from Harvard . " But in particle physics , when you smash two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even a truck or two . We 're repeating one of the miracles of the universe ? transforming energy into matter . " IN 1911 the New Zealand scientist Ernest Rutherford presented a theory that overturned the belief that the atom was solid and that set the stage for today 's physics . It resulted from an experiment in which gold foil was bombarded with alpha particles , fast-moving helium nuclei . Most particles shot right through the foil , although a few ? one in 8,000 or so ? bounced back . Rutherford 's reasoning in solving this puzzle was perfect . Since most particles zipped through the foil , gold atoms must be mostly empty space , but with something small and hard in the middle ? the atomic nucleus . His experimental method ? similar to shooting bullets at a shrouded object and studying the ricochet to deduce what is inside ? is still used in modern accelerators. 4  |p654  Rutherford had understandably pictured the atom as a tiny solar system . But by the start of World War II , physicists had sharpened their picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements then known were described as combinations of protons , neutrons , and electrons ? held to be the fundamental building blocks of matter . At the center of each atom , in this view , was a nucleus of neutral neutrons and positive protons , the number of protons identifying the element . The lightest was hydrogen , with one proton . The heaviest naturally occurring element , uranium , had 92 protons . For each proton in the nucleus , there was a negatively charged electron , gyrating around the atom 's core at a distance 50,000 times the diameter of the nucleus . If a hydrogen atom 's nucleus were the size of a tennis ball , its electron would be two miles away . Besides accelerators , particle physicists need detectors to record the collisions of subatomic particles . Among the first detectors were cloud chambers , in which particles from collisions swept through water vapor , leaving tracks of droplets that could be photographed for analysis . In modern bubble chambers , invented by physicist Donald Glaser , a liquid is used in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by watching bubbles form in a beer glass . Detectors can be grand in scale . The Big European Bubble Chamber at CERN is a four-story steel tank holding more than 10,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and neon chilled to minus 243 ? C ( 30 ? above absolute zero ) . I clambered atop the tank on ladders and catwalks resembling the superstructure of a battleship . On top were four cameras . Chargeless neutrinos , debris from proton collisions in the accelerator , enter the bubble chamber , collide with hydrogen and neon nuclei , and create a spray of wildly scattering highenergy particles . In their wake the liquid begins to boil , and at that instant the cameras fire to record the particles ' bubbly tracks . Computer-controlled electronic detectors , which record signals generated by passing particles , are replacing bubble chambers . These detectors are sensitive enough to record an event shorter than the time it takes a particle to zip across a nucleus at virtually the speed of light . 654 " We can tell exactly what particles have been caught , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . He ad-mits it 's an Alice-in-Wonderland approach , " like trying to tell the color of invisible jer-seys on invisible football players by watching the movement of the ball . " ONE OF THE MOST provocative ideas of modern physics arose from the 1928 equation of British theorist Paul Dirac , which predicted the existence of antimatter . Carl Anderson of the California Institute of Technology confirmed this idea in 1932 , with his discovery of a positive electron , or positron , a particle just like an electron but with a positive rather than a negative charge . When matter and antimatter meet , they annihilate each other in a burst of radiation . Since Anderson 's discovery physicists have shown that for every type of particle there must also be an antiparticle . This quirk of nature has led physicists to speculate about encounters between the universe and an anti-universe . In a poem , Harold Furth , now director of Princeton 's Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey , imagines that Dr. Edward Teller , a creator of the hydrogen bomb , meets a Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands clasped , and the rest was gamma rays . " Antimatter poses a mystery : If particles vanish when they meet their opposites , and if every particle can have an antiparticle , why is the world made only of matter ? There appears to be no more than one part in ten billion of antimatter in interstellar space . Where has all the antimatter gone ? Physicists think they know : During the first split second after the big bang , there was a small excess of matter over antimatter . Particles and antiparticles collided , annihilating each other and leaving behind only radiation and the surplus matter . These residual particles make up almost everything in the universe today : stars , galaxies , the earth , and Edward Teller . The two decades after World War II saw the blossoming of the atomic age , and to confident physicists full understanding of the atom , indeed , of the entire universe , seemed at hand . But larger and larger accelerators ? most of them patterned after a @# National Geographic , May 1985 Worlds Wii  |p655  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of California at Berkeley ? constantly uncovered new particles . By the early 1960s dozens were known , a melange that physicists began calling a zoo . There seemed to be no truly basic unit of matter . Order came to the zoo in 1963 . Murray Gell-Mann at Caltech and George Zweig at CERN independently accounted for the newly discovered particles by theorizing that they were composed of three smaller building blocks . Zweig called them aces , from the expression : " Dealer 's choice ? aces are wild . " Gell-Mann named them quarks . " I liked the sound , " Gell-Mann told me . " Later I read Finnegans Wake , by James Joyce , and came upon the line , Three quarks for Muster Mark ! ' There were three of them , and there were three particles in the proton . I knew the name was right . " In 1969 the Nobel Committee awarded the physics prize to Gell-Mann for his work in classifying particles . Gell-Mann 's whimsical choice of the name quark set a trend . In order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " up , " " down , " and " strange . " These labels do not reflect relative position or eccentricity : They distinguish quarks according to their properties , including their electric charge ? always plus or minus onethird or two-thirds that of a proton . QUARK THEORY ? since confirmed by experiment ? restored simplicity to nature . The new particles and the two old members of the atomic nucleus ? the proton and the neutron ? could be explained as combinations of quarks , bonded together according to their " color . " Color is a special property of quarks that enables them to join and form new particles . A quark 's other properties , among them its electric charge , determine its " flavor " ? whether it is up , down , or strange . A proton consists of two up quarks with a positive charge of two-thirds each and one down quark with a negative charge of one-third ; together they yield a single positive charge . In the same way , one up and two down quarks combine to form a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in accelerators . It appeared as part of  |p656  a meson , a high-energy embrace of quark and antiquark that lasts only an instant before ending in mutual annihilation . " Most of us had assumed there were just three quarks . We were n't looking for more , " said Samuel Ting of MIT , in charge of an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory . Ting shared the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics with Burton Richter , who had led a similar experiment at Stanford . The fourth quark 's existence had been predicted by Sheldon Glashow , a Harvard theorist who christened it a " charmed " quark . Fanciful classification continued in 1977 , when Leon Lederman and a Fermilab team discovered a fifth quark called " bottom " or " beauty . " While the up and down quarks make up protons and neutrons in our everyday , lowenergy world , the other quarks exist only at extremely high energy , such as is found in the biggest accelerators . In 1984 CERN announced that colliding beams of protons and antiprotons had produced evidence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some physicists hope that it is a final truth . However many flavors of quark there are , one oddity stands out about these subatomic particles : It seems impossible to jar loose a single quark from a proton or neutron . Quarks apparently exist only in trios or in quark/antiquark pairs . This trait , called confinement , inescapably binds single quarks together . " Remember energy is matter and matter is energy , " Sheldon Glashow told me . " When you throw energy at a proton in an effort to shake loose one quark , you create quark pairs out of the energy from the accelerator . " Glashow and other theorists remain skeptical of the provisional announcement in 1977 that William Fairbank , an experimental physicist at Stanford , had found something that looked like a free quark . I visited Fairbank in his lab , a clutter of pipes and wiring that resembles an illegal distillery . Genial and bespectacled , Fairbank said he and colleagues had found quark-like electric charges in dust-mote-size spheres of niobium metal levitated by magnets . Fairbank believes he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four test balls . " This means it 's possible for fractionally charged particles , perhaps quarks , to exist free in nature , " Fairbank said . Fairbank 's presumed find has set off a worldwide rush to hunt free quarks . His supporters suggest that a few quarks escaped confinement the instant after the big bang , and that Fairbank has trapped some of these free-spirited particles ? spares at the creation . But firm evidence of a solo quark remains elusive , leaving most physicists certain that lone quarks are locked forever within larger particles . Proclaims Murray Gell-Mann : " I do n't believe Bill Fairbank has found a free quark , but if he has , it 's one of mine . " NEARLY ALL the several hundred known subatomic particles are made of quarks , bound together by what physicists call the strong nuclear force . The exceptions are called leptons , Greek for " slight . " The best-known lepton is the electron , first identified in 1897 . As electric current , electrons put us in daily contact with the subatomic world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Physicists are not sure why two other leptons even exist . Muons , discovered in 1937 , have about 200 times as much mass as electrons and are the major by-product of the cosmic radiation that constantly bombards earth . Far heavier and equally furtive is the tau , a lepton discovered in 1976 . Like the electron and muon , it carries a negative electric charge . The other leptons are neutrinos ? " little neutral ones " ? that carry no charge and are so light that their mass , if any , has so far gone undetected . Each of the neutrinos seems to couple with a heavier partner ? a tau , muon , or electron . Scientists are still searching for the tau neutrino . National Geographic , May 1985  |p658  Drasko Jovanovic at Fermilab told me that because neutrinos react only very weakly with other matter , they whip through everything . Several million neutrinos , traveling at the speed of light , are flying through your body at this instant . " Nothing stops them , not even a slab of lead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been suggested that beams of neutrinos passing through the earth be used for communication . It could work , but it would be expensive . " Meanwhile Jovanovic participates in a five-million-dollar experiment to determine if neutrinos have mass . If they do , they could account for as much as 90 percent of the mass of the entire universe since , ghostlike , they fill the cosmos . Most physicists believe that the six leptons and the six flavors of quarks account for all matter , although a few theorists toy with the idea of particles more fundamental yet . The universe also contains force carriers called gauge particles . Carlo Rubbia began capturing certain gauge particles at CERN in 1982 and 1983 . " They 're little beasts we call W 's and Z 's , " says Rubbia , an animated Italian . " We 've been on their trail for years . " W and Z particles exist for less than a billionth of a billionth of a second and more often than not spend their brief lives within the nucleus , where they cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubbia commands a 20-million-dollar electronic detector built specifically to find the W and Z particles . Big as a house , the detector is a vast network of coaxial cables and battleship-gray steel plates straddling a @#  |p659  section of CERN 's main accelerator where protons and antiprotons collide . The charged particles liberated by these collisions streak through the detector 's gas atmosphere , generating trails of tiny signals . Their tracks appear on computer screens as V-shaped patterns , the arms of the V indicating where one particle has decayed into two or more other particles . " We do n't actually see the particles . Their lives are too short , " Rubbia told me . " But decay products from W particles , for instance , fly predominantly forward . When we see this , we know we 've got one . " For his pioneering work Rubbia shared the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics with CERN colleague Simon van der Meer . The W and Z particles carry the weak force , one of three forces governing the behavior of atoms . The weak force breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a proton , an electron , and an antineutrino . Other gauge particles , called photons , impart the electromagnetic force , about 100,000 times more powerful than the weak force . The electromagnetic force is responsible for keeping electrons in orbit around the nucleus , making atoms ? and this magazine ? seem solid . Most powerful of all ? a hundred times more powerful than the electromagnetic force ? is the strong force . Carried by gluons , it holds together the atomic nucleus . Besides these three forces , the other known force at work in the universe is gravity . It is by far the weakest ? the strong force is some 1038 ( 1 followed by 38 zeros ) times more powerful . A still undetected particle , the graviton , may be the carrier of gravity , which has no meaningful role inside atoms . Without gravity , however , there would be no universe , since it binds together stars and galaxies , holds the earth in orbit , and keeps our feet planted on the ground . MIDWAY in the seven-mile auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the air is rank with auto exhaust . In a cavern just off the smoggy roadway , shielded from cosmic radiation by the bulk of Mont Blanc , a special detector is testing whether the proton decays like most other particles , an idea that two decades ago would have been considered scientific heresy . In the 19th century the Scottish scientist James Maxwell discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same force . Today some physicists believe that the universe 's four forces are but manifestations of a single and deeper force . In the past two decades these scientists have proposed mathematical explanations ? " grand unified theories " ? of how the weak force , the strong force , and the electromagnetic force @# may be entities of a single underlying interaction . None of these theories yet embrace the universal fourth force , gravity . But they do predict that protons decay into other particles , because the strong force that binds a proton together and the weak force that causes radioactive decay may spring from the same basic interaction . The grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million trillion trillion years or so to decay ? more time than has passed since the universe began . How can shortlived humans hope to measure the life span of such a durable subatomic particle ? " Obviously we ca n't wait billions of years to watch one proton and see if it disappears , " Italian physicist Pio Picchi told me deep inside Mont Blanc . " But we can assemble immense numbers of protons and see if one decays during a one-year period . " If protons do indeed decay , then at least one should die during the course of the year . Picchi keeps watch on the hundred million trillion trillion protons in a 150-ton stack of iron slabs . These are fitted with thousands of detectors similar to Geiger counters , each waiting to pick up an infinitesimal burst of radiation emitted by a dying proton . So far at least one candidate event has been noted , the  |p661  possible decay of a proton into a muon and another particle called a kaon . Similar experiments in the United States , Japan , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theorists to rethink their grand unified theories . But if proof is found that protons decay , it will mean that matter is inherently unstable . It would also prove what poets have said all along ? that nothing lasts forever . Besides predicting proton decay , grand unified theories attempt to trace the history burst of of the universe back to its creation in the big bang some 15 billion years ago . Since then the cosmos has been constantly expanding . @# Today the visible universe is growing every second by a volume equal to that of the Milky Way galaxy . During the 1930s astrophysicists realized that the particle reactions that other physicists were studying in cyclotrons were identical to those occurring in stars . Today physicists of both stripes have joined forces to theorize that all matter was born at the big bang . In the extreme heat of that instant all four forces , including gravity , may have been unified as one . Then , as the universe cooled , the forces split apart and their underlying unity became obscured .  |p662  NO ACCELERATOR will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some physicists once thought it might be a waste of money to build bigger machines . However , Sheldon Glashow says : " We will find nothing if we do not look . We theorists are dependent upon experimental discoveries . Without them we are no better than medieval theologians , who endlessly debated how many angels might dance on the head of a pin . " Theorists like Glashow work in a delicate balance with experimentalists to uncover the hidden unity linking the three basic forces to gravity . Says avowed experimentalist Carlo Rubbia : " Theorists tend to forget that every time we look someplace new with a bigger machine a surprise awaits us . " Experimentalists like Rubbia prevail for the moment at CERN , and they are building a new accelerator 17 miles in circumference . The mammoth machine will cost half a billion dollars , a remarkable investment considering that in its lifetime it will propel less than a gram of matter . At Fermilab in Illinois , physicists have doubled up by constructing a new accelerator ring inside the tunnel housing their first machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a colossal collision energy of two trillion electron volts as they travel a circuit equal in distance to five round-trip journeys to the moon , 2,400,000 miles . Even more ambitious is the accelerator , perhaps 100 miles around , that U. S. scientists want to build . It would dwarf Fermilab 's four-mile accelerator , visible from 500 miles in space . Perhaps the biggest obstacle to such megaengineering projects is the shrinking federal science budget . " We practically have to beg for money , " says Fermilab director Leon Lederman . CERN , a comparable laboratory , enjoys about twice as much funding as Fermilab . Lederman and other American particle physicists fear that tight budgets may cost @# the U. S. its traditional lead in the exploration of the atom . Money-conscious federal officials often ask Leon Lederman why the U. S. needs costly machines that can not help solve pressing social problems . His answer never varies : " Learning about the ultimate nature of matter is of fundamental importance to the human race . It gives us a vision of ourselves , who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always drawn powerful intellects and personalities , such as Murray GellMann , who with Lederman and others has @#  |p663  set the pace of particle research for three decades . Small and intense , with steel-gray hair and penetrating eyes , Gell. - Mann 's mind encompasses quarks and proton decay as easily as mushrooms or obscure languages , two of his other numerous interests . I asked him one day if physicists were not profoundly arrogant to think that they could explain the origin of the universe and everything in it by using only accelerators , telescopes , and equations . " We believe , " he said , " that our calculations are essentially correct and that we are on the edge of fully understanding the atom as well as the beginnings of the universe . It 's a little like the ant contemplating the skyscraper , is n't it ? " And where will an understanding of the universe 's deepest secrets lead us ? . " There will be new technology , certainly , " Murray Gell-Mann went on . " But most remarkable will be that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star will have traced their origin back to the very beginning ? a small speck of the universe comprehending the whole . "
