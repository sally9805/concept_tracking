He was expelled from Argentina in 1979 after the right-wing military regime had him imprisoned and tortured , without ever bothering to accuse him of a crime . But last week Jacobo Timerman , 61 , who has since become an Israeli citizen , returned to Argentina for a firsthand look at life under the newly elected civilian government of Ral Alfonsin . His return , he explains , is for two reasons : to recover his newspaper La Opinion , which was confiscated and later auctioned off by the military junta , and to seek justice against his torturers . Timerman , who recorded his ordeal in Prisoner Without a Name , Cell Without a Number , has not decided whether he will-or can-reopen his paper ( he says he likes writing books ) , but if he does , it sounds as if the editor will be progovernment . " I am really impressed with the new President , " he says . " I am not used to so much democracy . " <P> <P> Ten years ago , Don Everly put down his guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus ending on a sour note the stormy partnership with his brother that had spawned such hits as Bye Bye Love , Wake Up Little Susie and Cathy 's Clown . While they went their separate ways during the 1970s , neither went very far as a solo performer . Now Don , 46 , and Phil , 44 , have put aside their differences , and last September the Everlys gave a reunion concert in London , which will be broadcast this week on HBO . " Phil and I are getting along now , " says Don . " It will be interesting to see where this takes us . " They plan a new album this spring and possibly a tour . And while the singing siblings are not the baby-faced boys they once were , their rocking harmonies remain everly sweet . <P> <P> Their grand jet from the Bolshoi Ballet to freedom in 1979 landed Valentina and Leonid Kozlov in the charmed troupe of Soviet dance defectors that includes Rudolf Nureyev , Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov . Now the couple , who have dazzled audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making yet another artistic leap , from terpsichorean classics to a Broadway revival , Rodgers and Hart 's On Your Toes . Actually , the couple have already done seven weeks in the show while it was being readied in Washington , B.C. , and Seattle . Their Broadway run will be only two weeks , filling in for the vacationing regulars in the roles of the Russian ballerina and her dance partner . All this bouncing about seems very American , which Valentina , 29 , takes to enthusiastically . " It 's so fast , " she says . " Maybe it 's crazy , but it 's life . " For his part , Leonid , 36 , has noted one happy difference about Broadway : " In the theater , people are applauding all the time . In ballet , they applaud at the end . " <P>
