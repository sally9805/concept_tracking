by Dolly 's sister , they move ( along with three associates picked up on the way ) into a tree house , while the assembled forces of law and order try to coax them down . They sit , listening to the wind , talking and ( so they suppose ) thinking . One of the number , a judge with what sounds like an alarmingly expanded idea of the 14th Amendment , asks , for example , " How could you ever care about one girl ? Have you ever cared about one leaf ? " My point is that in his more journalistic pieces , like The Muses Are Heard ( 1956 ) , an account of the visit to the Soviet Union by an American company performing Porgy and Bess , or like In Cold Blood , Capote is forced by the independent existence of the story he is reporting to forgo such banal and egregious reminders of his literary presence . That is , he can not as easily make a hero of himself as resident literary genius . His fiction , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , unfortunately , with liberation , even though he never adequately imagines a society from which escape is made to seem more than quixotic . Of what , for Capote , does liberation consist ? Apparently in the ability to write such sentences as this , the opening sentence of The Grass Harp : " When was it that first I heard of the grass harp ? Long before the autumn we lived in the China tree ; an early autumn , then ; and of course it was Dolly who told me , no one else would have known to call it that , a grass harp . " Perhaps Dolly is a reader of Coleridge , author of " The Aeolian Harp , " or of Shelley , who asks the west wind to " make me thy lyre as the forest is . " Obviously it is Capote who may have done the reading , and who in any case has in mind the posture of the Romantic artist whose inspiration sweeps through him from forces not at all socially derived . Such writing characterizes no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " beautiful " or " moving , " an evidence of something in the writer that is " deeply good " and that other people ought not to tamper with . Capote is so committed to this kind of writing , and so strongly in need of it as a cover for violent feelings , that even after In Cold Blood he could publish that famous piece of fruitcake , " A Christmas Memory . " There the Col-lin and Dolly of The Grass Harp find their substitutes in a kite-flying duo com-posed of Buddy , the Capote boy figure , and his Cousin Sookie . They live , as you might guess , with relatives " who have power over us , and frequently make us cry . " Capote , that is , never fully learned as much as he might have from In Cold Blood : that there are in American life starker versions of his own conflicted nature , and that these make his aestheti-cism not only outworn but irrelevant . Vengefulness , as his celebrated friends were to discover , was an essential part of Capote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer . It was there from the start , however sporadically , as in the terrifying little tale called " Mariam " ( 1945 ) , in which a waif unaccountably turns up at the doorstep of a nice retired lady and proceeds to take over the apartment and her life to a terrifying degree , a waif who exists only as a repressed but unbanisha-ble part of the woman herself . His senti-mentality became the re-verse side , the most public side , of his vengefulness , a complementary form of ab-straction . The killers in Kan-sas were a magnified mirror image of an alienation that he knew must finally kill even a good father , or the women who are a manage-able substitute for the good father . The Clutter part of American life , resting con-tentedly in its security , this very emanation of the Ei-senhower ethos , is forced to meet elements no less Amer-ican that it can not compre-hend . It collides with the fa-therless , the rejected , the wandering and savage ele-ments in America that must mark their presence in someone else 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for writing ? and the motive of revenge is classic ? so long as the writer does not fail to make available in the writing some full and powerful measure of whatever offends him . Mailer , Bellow , O'Connor , and Roth are all contemporaries of Capote who have sufficiently done this . Too often Capote fails to do so , and will instead trivialize his own deep contempt for the order of things . That includes , I suspect , an ultimate distaste for his own body and its sexual life , which by his testimony sounds as if it had been neither very active nor very pleasurable . Scarcely anywhere in Capote 's writing is there a scene of any duration in which two people make physical love ; and one such moment , a mere vignette in Other Voices , Other Rooms , so disturbs the boy and girl who witness it that they then forever turn away from one another . Nor is Capote to be depended upon even in areas he does choose to write about , like social fame . His incessant gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the source of their power in American society . If most of his fiction could have been set anywhere , it could as easily have occurred in any other decade or century ; and this is true to a serious degree even of his journalism . It seems not to have mattered to him that he came to maturity in a period that saw the Second World War and Vietnam , the turmoil of the ' 60s and the fight the world over for equality . It was a period , too , when the challenge to historical authority came to manifest itself , as at last it had to do , in bitter recriminations about sexual differences and sexual hegemony . While it is not Capote , but one of his characters , who says in the story " Mojave " that " Women are like flies : they settle on sugar or shit , " his own views , as in his conversations with Grobel , include such howlers as the statement that women ought to be paid less than men for the same job because " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was as uninquisitive about the forces at work in contemporary culture as a writer of his ambitions possibly could be , even about the very forces that in many places still count his own sexual practices a crime . At the end of Music for Chameleons ,
