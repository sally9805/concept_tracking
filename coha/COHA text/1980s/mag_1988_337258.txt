This is the last in a series of profiles published over the past year in which TIME has explored the backgrounds , personalities and political outlooks of the 1988 Democratic and Republican presidential candidates . <P> Alexander Haig picked the wrong 15 minutes to be famous . Shortly after President Reagan was shot in 1981 , Haig went on television to reassure a frightened world that someone at the White House was in charge . Sweating , a crack in his voice , he uttered the immortal words , " I am in control here . " He came off like a character from Dr. Strangelove , and has never been allowed to forget it . Bumper stickers were recently spotted bearing a mushroom cloud with the slogan HAIG FOR PRESIDENT . LET 'S GET IT OVER WITH . <P> This week Haig will begin airing TV and radio ads in New Hampshire that try to put the episode in a more positive light . Titled " Take Charge , " the TV spot opens on a serene Haig , casually dressed in a suede jacket and orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire-style music swells in the background as Haig calmly recalls how , in a " dangerous atmosphere , " when the Pentagon was on nuclear alert and Moscow was confused , he had come forward and " said what had to be said . " He leans into the camera and confides , " I 'd do it again . " <P> The retired four-star general has been an actor in some of the most important crises of the postwar era . On paper , he seems an ideal Chief Executive . Yet Haig has trouble being taken seriously . It is not just that his chances are so slim , that he has no political base , money or organization . Haig has a flaw that is far more fatal : he simply can not gauge his effect on an audience . His campaign is based in part on proving that " I 'm not the ogre people thought . " But he is having a tough time doing it . <P> Campaigning late one evening in an American Legion hall in Portsmouth , N.H. , Haig made a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar on the back and demanded , " Right ? " The man mumbled his allegiance to Democrat Michael Dukakis . " You mean you 're Greek ? " Haig bellowed . Wagging a finger playfully , Haig continued , " Beware of Greeks bearing gifts . " No answer . Haig walked away , then turned back . " I 'll tell you something about Greek sailors , " he said , adding a locker-room comment about the danger of turning one 's back on them . Startled , the Dukakis supporter at last looked up , as Haig filled the stunned silence with a hearty guffaw . <P> His old boss Henry Kissinger labeled Haig " colossally self-confident . " On the campaign trail , only Jesse Jackson has as much panache . Genial one moment , Haig can then lower his voice , narrow his eyes in what an aide once described as a " laser blue death ray " and deliver a bitter , blistering attack on George Bush . Often hailed as a hero , Haig also has a sinister mystique : while a deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiretapping program ordered by Nixon and Kissinger , and he made regular trips to the FBI to read the transcripts . In Europe , where he performed masterfully as commander of NATO , Haig is revered . He may be the only American besides Jerry Lewis the French truly like . But in America , according to the TIME poll taken last week , 46% of Republicans said they had a " generally unfavorable " impression of him , compared with only 27% who gave him a favorable rating .
