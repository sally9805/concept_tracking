From preflight preparation to landing , piloting NASA 's specially equipped ER- 2 high-altitude research aircraft is not for the fainthearted . The three pilots who flew the twelve solo missions through the Antarctic ozone hole found the task grueling . An hour before zooming into the stratosphere , each had to don a bright orange pressure suit and begin breathing pure oxygen to remove nitrogen from the blood and tissues , thus preventing the bends , which can result from rapid reductions in air pressure . Once airborne , " you have to have patience , " says Pilot Ron Williams , who flew the first mission . " You 're strapped into a seat and ca n't move for seven hours . " <P> Although the pilots had been briefed by meteorologists on what to expect , they still found conditions aloft astonishingly harsh . Accustomed to clear , broad vistas at high altitudes , the pilots  --  who took the ER-2 as high as 68,000 ft.  --  were startled to encounter layers of translucent mist composed of tiny ice particles . " I went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the whole time , " says Williams of the first flight . Another surprise : temperatures did not warm when the plane soared into the stratosphere . Instead , they plummeted to - 130 degreesF , low enough to cause worries about a fuel freeze-up . <P> At 60,000 ft. , winds as high as 150 knots buffeted the aircraft . Even so , the real difficulty came from 40-knot gusts that tossed the plane around during landings . With special scientific instruments installed in pods on its long , droopy wings , the ER-2 is " like a big albatross  --  it 's heavy-winged , " says Operations Manager James Cherbonneaux of NASA 's Ames Research Center . While watching a particularly hairy approach to the runway at Punta Arenas , he recalls , " I chewed a little bit of my heart out . " <P> Conditions aboard the DC-8 were considerably better . The plane , which carried up to 41 scientists , flew no higher than 42,000 ft. on its 13 missions , and those on board were free to move about . But heavy clouds obscured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights were a tedious eleven hours long . Observes Atmospheric Scientist Ed Browell , of NASA 's Langley Research Center in Virginia : " I sort of likened what we were doing to taking off from the East Coast , flying to the West Coast to do our work , then flying back East to land . " <P> To break the monotony , scientists took aboard a variety of stuffed animals , including a seal , cat and penguin , and warmed up snacks of pizza , empanadas , popcorn and hamburgers in the microwave oven . Cabin temperature was kept cool to avoid overheating the high-tech instrumentation . Says Atmospheric Physicist Geoffrey Toon , of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. : " If you tried to sleep during your off hours , usually you froze . "
