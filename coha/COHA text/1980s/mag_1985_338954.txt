Covering seven heads of state and gov- <P> ernment , in competition with 2,300 other reporters , photographers , broadcast technicians and producers , requires special abilities , and some agility as well . The TIME correspondents and photographers who reported on last week 's economic summit in Bonn are veterans of several of these mammoth affairs . They came prepared to encounter , and counter , almost every sort of logistical or substantive emergency . <P> White House Correspondents Laurence I. Barrett , attending his fifth summit , and Barrett Seaman , whose experience goes back to the 1978 meeting in Bonn , had to contend with what Seaman calls " the bane of all reporters covering presidential trips " : pools , the often tedious arrangements in which publications rotate coverage where access is limited . " They are necessary , but they add enormously to already grueling schedules , " Seaman says . " Oppressive security arrangements in Bonn also made coverage of the ceremonies quite difficult . " <P> TIME Photographers Dirck Halstead , David Burnett , Dennis Brack , Arthur Grace , Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sites President Reagan was to visit . They also had to meet precise scheduling , especially at week 's end . Within hours , film had to be shot , processed and transmitted to the U.S. as TIME held its presses . <P> European Correspondent Lawrence Malkin has learned , from five previous summits , the complications of official press briefings . " Each government holds its own , at widely scattered locations , in five different languages , " notes Malkin . " They are also usually simultaneous , so each country 's view dominates its own press . " Senior Correspondent Frederick Ungeheuer , who has traveled to three summits , found that his first obstacle this time was technical : adapting the portable computer he brought from New York to the West German telephone system . A mini-summit of his own with telephone engineers and a computer service representative finally worked out the bugs . <P> For TIME Bonn Bureau , which played host to the visiting colleagues , the economic summit turned out to be an interlude in reporting on the Bitburg controversy . Bureau Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent John Kohan reported on a commemoration by U.S. Jews at the Dachau concentration camp and the official observances at Bergen-Belsen . The bureau 's planning , together with that of dozens of staff members in New York , enabled TIME to have one of its latest closings ever , and to bring readers , only hours later , the dramatic events of the summit and Bitburg.
