CADILLAC JACK , by Larry McMurtry . Simon &; Schuster. 395 pp. $15.95 . Cadillac Jack McGriff runs an antique store on wheels . He sells a little bit of everything as he travels cross-country - even camel pads and Maori warclubs . And World War I parachutes . He tries to find what people think they want and they seem to want things like that . Jack has been married twice , not that anyone would have noticed . His ex-wives serve as subjects for jokes and insipid comments on American life . McGriff grew up in a trailer house in Texas , became a bulldogger at rodeos , got around with various females , and then went into the junk-antique- thingamajig business from the back of his pearl- colored car . There is hardly a motel between D.C. and Seattle he can ' t call home . So that is the setting for Larry McMurtry ' s latest novel . In D.C. , Jack becomes a " friend " of a gorgeous morsel named Cindy Sanders and meets senators who should be driven from office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny ones , I admit ) that cavort on the dining table and lick from guests ' plates before said guests have finished . There is a character named Ponsonby and another named Lilah Landry . I fear D.C. has addled McMurtry ' s filbert . He should go back to Texas where he knew reality when it seized him . But we are only on page 50 , as brandy is being served in the study . One of the guests is Sir Cripps Crisp . What can McMurtry be up to ! An upside-down parody ? Some arcane social exegesis ? ( Same thing . Pay no attention . ) We move on . Sunday , Fat Sunday . A person who imagines she is Marlene Dietrich , dahlink . She is wrong . There turns out to be a boot chapter featuring Billy the Kid and those boots which were pulled off him at " the end , " run down at the heels . Cadillac Jack wants to take Cindy to Clovis , N.M. , to buy them . They are priceless ! ( Cindy comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I finally got it . " Cadillac Jack " is just a spoof . But , lord love a partridge , of what ? I haven ' t even smiled yet . ) For a couple of minutes the plot seems to have something to do with stealing the contents of the Smithsonian ( selling it all to Arabs , no doubt ) , and replacing it with " first-rate repros . " That means forgeries , etc . As McMurtry so originally says , it ' s " well , mind-boggling . " But nothing comes of that . There are two little girls , at least so described , but they are about as little as Mary Martin singing " My Heart Belongs to Daddy . " Little orgies . Boring . Bessie Lump . I think she ' s a CIA agent . Ferrets . Oblivia Brown , a D.C. hostess . George Psalmanazar , a Third World person . He may be a journalist and not a Th.Wld. person at all , but by this time you are asleep . Only first : " Brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boog Miller ' s and drink beer and tomato juice for breakfast . Life in D.C. should be DDT ' d , and so should women who exercise . This is all amiable and well enough written . I have admired McMurtry for years , especially " All My Friends Are Going To Be Strangers " and " Leaving Cheyenne , " but I ' m sorry to say I wish he hadn ' t bothered with this one .
