This play happened in the first game this season , against Xavier , a drive in which Russell , a 6-foot-6-inch forward , began at the edge of the foul circle , started up toward the basket , floated down the left side of the lane , pivoted in the air as he approached the rim , and scored with a powerful dunk . Witnesses said it was more plausible to think that Russell was lowered from the ceiling than to imagine that he started with his shoes on the floor , just like everybody else. // " It ' s a rocket , " said Lou Carnesecca , his coach . " It ' s a wow . That ' s what you say . Wow . " Russell sat forward as he started to explain what he had done . He put his left hand in front of him , palm down , chest high . " The basket was over here , " he said. // He had to be interrupted . Did he mean the basket was directly in front of him , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much above the rim ? // Russell smiled . " I didn ' t even believe I did it myself , " he said . " Sometimes I jump , and I don ' t even realize I ' m up that high . I don ' t understand it at times . I just do what comes to me . There are times I do think , ' What am I doing up there ? ' " // For the third consecutive year , Russell will play in the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden , when the Redmen face Kansas tonight at 7 , followed by the Indiana-Villanova game . By now , when St. John ' s runs its fast break and the ball lands in Russell ' s hands , there is a special buzz in the crowd as the ball moves upcourt . The buzz says : " Watch this. " // Unlike some schools in the big-time , St. John ' s does not measure and publish the vertical leap of each player . That is unnecessary . Alumni Hall has only 6 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that result when coaches try to create heroes of teenagers in order to sell tickets. // Publicly , Carnesecca hands out one-liners far more often than raves . But when he thinks of where Russell ' s gift and attitude can take him , he says , " He could be an all-star . " The coach does not mean a college all-star. // Two years ago , in the Holiday Festival , basketball fans discovered David Russell . The basketball coaches had known about him because he had played in some of the major all-star games . But basketball reputations , to the public at least , are more easily built in Manhattan and Brooklyn than they are on eastern Long Island. // Russell went to Bellport High School and did not travel into the city to play , even for the summer league teams . And so although his name was included when the basketball establishment listed its names for the future , Russell ' s limited exposure prevented him from being mentioned among the elite. // Carnesecca knew that meant nothing . If anything , that would work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players who grew into men by the time they were 15 , and who grew unhappy because of the expectations placed upon them . When Russell was 15 , he was barely able to dunk . He was safe from the glare. // " I don ' t think David realized his potential , " Carnesecca said . " You knew right away . You know when it ' s there . A lot of guys reach their peak . He still has a lot to go. " // Two years ago , after he played 22 minutes in the 78-70 victory over Boston College that gave St. John ' s a record fourth Holiday Festival championship , the word was out . Russell scored 10 points and had seven rebounds . It was not what Russell did that was exciting , it was how he did it . Within 17 seconds , he made a driving layup , a steal , and a drive for a slam dunk. // " There ' s a little bit of artistry there , " Carnesecca said . " He doesn ' t hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . He doesn ' t. " // Carnesecca looked for the right word . " There ' s a lot of the ballet in him , " he said . That night , when the game was over and the first-place awards were given out , Russell started to walk away . The fans were chanting , " Reggie . . . Reggie . . . Reggie , " in anticipation that Reggie Carter , the senior guard , would be named the most valuable player of the tournament. // The fans were wrong . Russell , a freshman on a team that had fallen 2 points short of a trip to the Final Four the previous spring , was a near unanimous winner. // " I don ' t know why they would want to give it to me , " he said that night . Russell averaged 10. 7 points and 5. 3 rebounds a game that season . As a sophomore , he averaged 14. 8 points and 7. 8 rebounds. // This season , as a co-captain and as a target of box-and-one and triangle-and-two defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounds. // Russell has worked to develop a jump shot that adds variety to his game . He has learned , partly from Willis Reed , the former Knick center who assisted Carnesecca last season , how to take advantage of his speed and use his body more efficiently against stronger players . He has learned that drawing a foul and making two free throws can be as effective as a flying dunk. // " I think he ' s on schedule , " Carnesecca said . " He ' s making the kind of progress that ' s needed where he wants to go . His game is still way ahead of him . He ' ll be an even better pro when you play with the 24-second clock , when you don ' t have those zones , triangles and boxes. " // Carnesecca said all Russell needs now is a little better-developed sense of timing . That and something else . " Just a little bit of selfishness , " the coach said . " He doesn ' t come on strong , that ' s the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only question left is : When will he move on ? Already , Russell has been approached by someone who was interested in becoming his agent . Russell wisely went right to Carnesecca . But Russell has opened the possibility that this will be his last college season , that he will leave for the National Basketball Association. // " That ' s my first priority , " he said . " When the times comes , I ' ll go , if I ' m good enough . " " If the money ' s there , and it ' s guaranteed , " Carnesecca said , " and his family wants him to , we will definitely go . If it ' s not this year , it will be next year . I wouldn ' t hold him back . That ' s his gift , to play . He ' s got to play. " //
