The six-point proposal , designed to accomplish Israel ' s most ambitious goals in the war while avoiding an all-out Israeli assault on Palestinian strongholds in west Beirut , had the tone of an ultimatum . It began with an Israeli pledge to observe the current cease-fire , but warned that any violation would cause a military response " with full severity. " // Israeli officials said that although Philip C. Habib , President Reagan ' s special envoy who is in Beirut , was making strenuous efforts to gain P.L.O. acquiescence , they saw no signs that the proposals would be accepted . They indicated that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and other key Cabinet members were not prepared to wait long for a positive diplomatic outcome before moving militarily . <> <> First Formal Formulation // Although the major elements of the plan have been mentioned at various times by various officials during the course of the fighting , today was the first occasion on which they had been formulated as a formal Cabinet resolution. // The plan contained these major points : // - The Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " full severity " if it is violated. // - The Lebanese Army , which has been rendered virtually powerless by the armed factions that have fought the Lebanese civil war , would enter west Beirut. // - All members of , in Israel ' s words , the 15 " terrorist organizations " under the P.L.O. would turn over their weapons to the Lebanese Army and leave the country. // - The departing column , under Red Cross protection , would leave for Syria along the Beirut-Damascus highway or an alternative route. // - Political negotiations would be started aimed at guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Lebanon and the departure of all foreign forces , including Syrian troops. // - Israel would accept the " good offices " of the United States in an effort to reach this agreement . The stipulation that all P.L.O. members , and not just the leaders , leave Lebanon is a key part of the Israeli demand . Defense Minister Sharon said in a television interview on Friday that the P.L.O. had offered to stop fighting if its leaders left Beirut and the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a half-measure , he disclosed . " Their leaders would leave , " he said , " they would go to another country , and immediately put the forces they would leave behind them into operation. " // He called the Israeli offer " a very generous proposal . " He added : " We offered them their lives . We offered them the possibility of leaving in organized convoys , under Red Cross supervision , to another Arab state. " // Mr. Sharon went on to say that Israeli control of the western part of the Beirut-Damascus highway , which left Syrian forces cut off from the Lebanese capital , " gives us , in my opinion , the possibility of choosing whatever option we want . " He said that the Palestinian leaders ' plea for safe exit " proves , as by a thousand testimonies , that they are in a desperate situation . We have to show patience . " <> <> Political Pressures Building // Nevertheless , Mr. Sharon is said by officials to have been pressing Prime Minister Menachem Begin and other Cabinet ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the P.L.O. does not capitulate quickly. // There is some anxiety here that time will allow political pressures to build , both inside and outside Israel , for a disengagement or compromise that would permit the P.L.O. to remain . Such a development , to which Israeli leaders now seem unlikely to agree , would be taken in the Arab world as a victory for the P.L.O. , given Israel ' s repeated declarations that its object was to destroy the Palestinian organization and drive it from Lebanon. // A nagging question in this is the American attitude . With the resignation of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. , who was regarded here to be understanding of Israel ' s goals in Lebanon , some officials are wondering how severe the American reaction would be to an assault on west Beirut. // They note that Mr. Begin and President Reagan agreed , during recent talks in Washington , on a three-point objective that Israel assumes remains in force despite Mr. Haig ' s impending departure . <> <> A 25-Mile Secure Zone // The points are the guarantee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of P.L.O. artillery and rockets that could hit northern Israeli settlements ; the departure of all foreign forces , including those of the Syrians and the Palestinians , and the reestablishment of a strong central Lebanese government. // Officials in Jerusalem have denied reports from Washington that Mr. Begin ever gave Mr. Reagan a pledge that Israeli forces would not enter west Beirut ; what he said , according to the officials , was that Israel had not taken a decision to enter the city and that that is still the case . Mr. Sharon told an Israel radio reporter today that an all-out assault could not be launched , even in reaction to a cease-fire violation , without further Cabinet action. // He said that every effort should be made to get the P.L.O. out without a battle , but stressed that there had never been a Government decision explicitly not to go into west Beirut . <> <> Thousands in Antiwar Protest // One reason for the aversion to an all-out assault is the high casualties it would cause among Israeli troops and Lebanese civilians , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large antiwar demonstration was held Saturday night in Tel Aviv , drawing what the Israeli press estimated to be a crowd of about 20 , 000 . Protesters carried signs reading , " We have no future on the graves of the Palestinians " and " How many more dead will it take ? " // The demonstration followed Mr. Sharon ' s plea in his Friday interview that " those on the home front , the press the party workers , show such composure " as soldiers on the battlefield . He added , " Let them hold their fire until the fire up there ceases. " //
