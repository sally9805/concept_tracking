' ' I steal from these graves for money , ' ' he says , standing in front of a one-room shack , home for his family of four . ' ' If I could find work , I ' d leave this place forever. ' ' // Miguel , who learned the trade from his father , says it is his wife who sells the pottery , textiles , and ceramic figures he steals from nearby graves. // Several nights a week , Miguel and a group of six men head toward the desert and one of many ancient burial grounds. // ' ' The first time I did this I was very young , maybe 12 or 13 , ' ' says one of the men in Miguel ' s group , as he prods the desert sand . ' ' It scared me to dig up someone ' s bones . . . . Now it ' s just a job.

In Peru alone , customs officials say , more than 50 , 000 pieces of pre-Columbian and colonial artwork are smuggled out of the country each year . Like many of its Latin American neighbors , Peru forbids clandestine excavations . But archaeologists say the plunder of artwork continues both here and throughout Latin America. // ' ' The risks are bigger now and so is the cost of smuggling stolen art , ' ' says Hugo Ludena , director of the Peruvian Institute of Culture , ' ' but as long as there is an international market for smuggled art , the illegal digs and art thefts will continue.

' ' // In January 1981 , US customs agents in Washington ' s Dulles Airport stopped a man returning from Lima on a routine check . According to the agents , the man ' s suitcases smelled odd , piquing their curiosity . When the traveler , New York art dealer David Bernstein , opened his luggage , the agents discovered a treasure-trove of pre-Columbian art - fresh from a grave . Among the artwork recovered were silver goblets , a feathered funeral shroud , a gold and silver death mask , and dozens of ceramic pots and figures. // That cache was only the tip of the iceberg . Federal agents later confiscated 586 Peruvian artifacts from Bernstein ' s New York apartment . His collection of pre-Columbian art was valued at more than $1. 7 million. // ' ' The Bernstein case was a real eye-opener , ' ' says Jack Brockman , cultural attache at the US embassy in Lima .

They argue that , without the international art market , much of the artwork recovered from grave sites in Latin America would have remained decaying in the ground or uncared for in local museums. // ' ' As dealers we are preserving these objects and making them available for the world to appreciate . . . . I think the artifacts belong to the world , not just the country whose ancestors conquered the ancient civilizations , ' ' art dealer Lee Moore told the Miami Herald. // Indeed , between 2 , 000 and 3 , 000 mummy bundles from southern Peru sit in the basement of Peru ' s National Archaeology and Anthropology Museum - where , say the museum ' s critics , they are being destroyed by rats , mold , and neglect. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says the museum ' s director of textiles , Edward Versteylen . ' ' When you consider the curator of this museum earns $180 a month , you can imagine how little we have for excavations , restoration . . . anything. ' ' // ' ' Quite frankly , ' ' says a former museum worker at Peru ' s National Museum of Art , ' ' I think the collections that were taken out of the country will last longer than those left behind . ' ' But archaeologists and museum officials say illegal digs destroy the archaeological worth of grave sites , while art-robbing obliterates a nation ' s link to its past. // ' ' We have no literature to reveal our history , ' ' says Culture Institute director Ludena . ' ' The artwork in the desert here is our connection to our past . . . . It is our national heritage.

Last year , the US became the first major art importer to sign . While the US signature does not carry full weight without support from other Western nations , it does give the president power to enter into emergency bilateral agreements with countries where the lure of the US market has resulted in serious pillage. // The Reagan administration , diplomatic sources say , has used the resolution in a kind of tit-for-tat agreement in countries where the drug trade flourishes . ' ' They help us curb drug smuggling , ' ' says one US insider , ' ' and we help them get their art back.

' ' // According to Mr. Versteylen of the National Archaeology and Anthropology Museum , most of Peru ' s priceless textiles - Nazca mantas valued at upwards of $70 , 000 - can be found only in the US or Europe . And the problem is by no means isolated to Peru . In Costa Rica , experts say that as many as 95 percent of the country ' s known archaeological sites have been plundered , while in Colombia an estimated 60 , 000 huaqueros earn at least a partial living selling stolen artifacts. // According to Ian Graham , a former curator at Harvard ' s Peabody Museum , Guatemala ' s Mayan tombs are virtually exhausted .
