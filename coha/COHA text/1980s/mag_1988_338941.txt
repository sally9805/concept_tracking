USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED , warn the prominently displayed red-and-white signs at the U.S. Army arsenal at Pine Bluff , Ark . Situated about 35 miles from Little Rock , off a busy state highway , the facility is the only producer of toxins for chemical weapons in the U.S. Since work resumed in December after a 19-year halt , the arsenal has manufactured a chemical called DF , which becomes nerve gas when mixed with alcohol . Workers are also busy incinerating some 94,000 lbs . of an obsolete hallucinogenic agent known as BZ . Yet area residents profess to have few fears about the facility . " Nothing bothers people out here , " says James Morgan , 46 , an insurance agent who lives near the site . " I guess it 's because they 've been around the arsenal so long . " <P> Pine Bluff is the only Army facility that makes lethal chemical compounds , but it is one of eight around the country where they are stored. * The entire U.S. arsenal consists of some 30,000 tons of deadly liquids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in drums ; the rest is contained in weapons ranging from some 3 million artillery rounds to nearly 500,000 rockets . Though virtually all are scheduled to be destroyed by the mid-1990s , the stockpiles have raised safety issues . Congress learned last April that the Army has discovered more than 1,000 leaking chemical weapons since 1981 . <P> The Nixon Administration halted production in 1969 after a nerve-gas accident at the Army 's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah killed more than 6,000 sheep . However , fears of an overwhelming Soviet advantage in chemical weapons led Congress to vote three years ago to resume manufacturing . As a safety measure , all new U.S. chemical weapons are made of " binary " compounds that are less toxic by themselves and can be stored and shipped separately . Only when the substances are combined , as in a fired artillery shell or an exploded bomb , do they become deadly . <P> Nonetheless , the Democrat-controlled Congress remains uneasy over the prospect of rebuilding the U.S. chemical arsenal . While the Reagan Administration views such weapons as a deterrent against aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Department request for $186 million for chemical arms . Opponents have gained another powerful ally in the U.S. chemical industry . In April , Robert Roland , president of the Chemical Manufacturers Association , which represents the major U.S. chemical companies , testified before Congress for a " strong , effective international treaty " to ban such weapons . Representatives of U.S. , Canadian , Japanese and European firms are now drafting a set of recommendations for facilitating an agreement and inspecting chemical-industry plants . <P> FOOTNOTE : *The other seven : Aberdeen , Md. ; Lexington , Ky. ; Anniston , Ala. ; Newport , Ind. ; Pueblo , Colo. ; Tooele , Utah ; and Umatilla , Ore .
