WASHINGTON  --  About 750 , 000 people who have defaulted on student loans or other government credit may not get federal tax refunds this year , officials said . Five government agencies have forwarded the names of loan defaulters to the Internal Revenue Service , and the money owed will be withheld from any refunds due those people on their 1985 taxes . Most of the defaults involve student loans , but others include money borrowed through the Small Business Administration , the Department of Housing and Urban Development , the Agriculture Department , and the Veterans Administration . " Scofflaw defaulters who think they ' ve outwitted and outrun the federal bureaucracy will learn first-hand that federal agencies now have the will  --  and effective ways  --  of collecting overdue debts , " Joseph Wright , deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget , said in a statement . The program was authorized by Congress on a trial basis in the 1984 tax law . Under that law , a government lending agency may forward a person ' s name to the IRS only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels . The agency also must notify defaulters 60 days before forwarding the case to the IRS . The new program has caused concern at the IRS and among tax experts , who fear that it could threaten the nation ' s tax system , which relies largely on voluntary compliance . In testimony to Congress last year , IRS Commissioner Roscoe Egger said IRS studies have indicated that people who have had their refunds reduced to collect child support or other non-tax debts " were twice as likely to become nonfilers in the succeeding year and three times as likely to have an income tax delinquency " as other people . But because tax refunds ordinarily are paid to more than three-quarters of all individual taxpayers , the Office of Management and Budget has concluded that the tax system is an effective way of collecting bad debts . Mr. Wright said the government is owed delinquent , non-tax debts totaling $20 billion , and the 750 , 000 people whose names recently were forwarded to the IRS owe a total of more than $1. 5 billion . The mere threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay their bad debts , Mr. Wright said in his statement . He mentioned a student loan defaulter who , after being notified that his debt was being forwarded to the IRS , " sold his wife ' s car to pay his debt in full . " The government began using the tax system to collect non-tax debts in 1981 , when it started a program to reduce refunds to collect child support and alimony due mothers on welfare . In 1984 , that program was expanded to include child and spousal support due to non-welfare mothers . Under that expanded program , the IRS " for the first time will be acting in the interests of a private individual , not a government entity , " Mr. Egger said . Under the new program , tax refunds may be withheld from people filing joint returns even if only one spouse has a bad debt . However , the spouse without the bad debt will be permitted to file an amended return for his or her share of the refund . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
