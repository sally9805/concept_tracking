Mandale sallies forth <P> August was a sour month for the Democrats . The party 's presidential ticket languished ten to 15 points behind the Republicans in the polls . Geraldine Ferraro parried reporters ' persistent badgering about her finances , Jesse Jackson sulked and demanded more respect , and Walter Mondale for the most part remained holed up in his suburban bunker in North Oaks , Minn . This week the Democrats will try to shake off the ennui , as Mondale and Ferraro take off together on a five-city , four-day campaign swing , the first leg in a long and uphill march toward Election Day . <P> The activity comes none too soon . A delegation of 15 Democratic Governors pleaded with Mondale to loosen up and try to show the American people what a regular fellow he really is-to " let his hair down , " as Maryland Governor Harry Hughes put it . Mondale , hair firmly in place , stiffly replied : " There is no question that a person has to communicate effectively . But this campaign is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan as an extremist and a flaky showman while casting himself as a seasoned , responsible realist . He accuses the President of trying to " flim-flam the American people " and " skate by the election " without confronting hard questions like the federal deficit . Mondale expects to introduce part of his own budget plan this month , possibly including a pledge that new tax revenues would be used to reduce the deficit , not fund social programs . <P> Running Mate Ferraro , meanwhile , harped on the war-and-peace issue before large and enthusiastic crowds . As a mother , she said , she feared that a second Reagan Administration might send her son John , 20 , off to war . She dismissed as specious a Philadelphia Inquirer story that a man later convicted of labor racketeering gave $700 to her congressional campaigns in 1980 and 1982 . Nor did she seem burdened by the financial questions that still plague her husband , who was dismissed last week by a New York City court as the conservator of a woman 's estate that he allegedly mishandled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voters were satisfied with Ferraro 's handling of the controversy . <P> Mondale 's aides insist that the issues-the deficit , the arms race , " fairness " - favor their man and that he understands better than the President the complexities of running the Government . " Public opinion is going to force the Reagan camp out of the photo-opportunity , nondebate strategy , " says Mondale Campaign Manager Robert Beckel . " If Reagan will stop ducking and running , I think you 'll see that style is overtaken by substance and that the American people are pretty smart . " Last week the two camps agreed to at least one Mondale-Reagan debate , and possibly more . <P> Mondale has already made some progress on the deficit , convincing at least some voters that the federal debt crisis is so severe that taxes will have to be raised despite Reagan 's promises to the contrary . The real question , he argues , is which candidate will raise taxes more fairly .                @ @ @ @ @
