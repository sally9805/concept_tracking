The area that constitutes the Bay State 's Eighth Congressional District has launched the political careers of a succession of notable Democrats : Boston Mayor James Michael Curley , President John F. Kennedy , House Speaker Tip O'Neill . Last week another famous name was added to the list : Joseph Kennedy II swept past ten other candidates for the Democratic primary nomination to replace O'Neill in Washington next year . <P> Kennedy , 33 , eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy , used a slick advertising campaign , a late endorsement from O'Neill and a strong get-out-the-vote operation to win 52.4% of the ballots . The closest of his rivals , State Senator George Bachrach , got 30.2% . Kennedy now faces Republican Businessman Clark Abt , who is given almost no chance . When family members gathered for a victory party , Senator Edward Kennedy , Joe 's uncle , quipped , " I 'm delighted Joe decided to run for the Eighth and not against me. "                   @ @
